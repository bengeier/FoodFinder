{"text":"I would give 3 starts, but they carry my favorite hard-to-find Danish beer (Tuborg) and that yields an extra star.  The moules (mussels) are definitely worth the 4 stars as well but the large party (read: non-cozy) atmosphere just doesn't quite fit the menu.  I think things here are a bit overpriced as well, but when you look around and see 10,000 sq ft of party space, it's easy to understand."}
{"text":"Never made it past the front desk staff.  We'd made a reservation that they decided not to honour because a large party came in unexpectedly.  I understand when you get slammed but how is it my fault and why did i leave feeling like I wasn't good enough to eat there?  I dine out, entertain clients and socialize a lot. This was an epic fail management wise.  Looking forward to trying again when the staff gets sorted out.  Great location.  Something good is needed in this area.  Hope whatever is going in beside Bed Bath & Beyond is competitive."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and very good mussels and appetizers!  Would return when I am in the area for sure."}
{"text":"This review is for beer only! One of the largest selection I have seen. Beers are well organized so easy to choose! If you can't decide, they have a few tastings as well. Our bartender is pretty helpful. The only downside is the price, but it's standard downtown price I guess."}
{"text":"Tons of different beer from all over the world. Fun place, good vibe. Can get a little pricey, but not outrageous. All in all, a good place to drink some beer with friends."}
{"text":"Sometimes things don't go right and the measure of a business is how they handle things when they don't go right. In that regard the Bier Market on King met my very high, used to be a food service professional, standards. My fish was over cooked and then upon mentioning it a most wonderful re- cook appeared. Both the server and manager were apologetic and helpful. Then, for them, things got worse as the bill was incorrect. We were already so impressed with the service so we knew it would be taken care of. And it was. Again very professional service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Visit this place with confidence. I'm  somewhat a regular on the patio and they're super. Great service, food is slightly a cut above the average bar food experience and the selection of brews will leave guessing what to have next!"}
{"text":"As I have quite a group of foodies for friends, I was expecting an impressive experience when I went to Bier Markt about a week ago upon the recommendation of my sister's boyfriend. 


My friend and I were offered a choice of seating areas only to be denied a table at our preferred section after all, then we were seated and left with a novel of a beer menu. Page after daunting page proved that the restaurant was worthy of its namesake, but without a knowledgeable server to offer suggestions of local brews based on our tastes, we both opted for Hoegaardens. 

The decor was great and the atmosphere was appropriately downtown chic, but when my friend's flammekueche arrived, we both agreed it was a very small portion for the price. She made no complaint of the taste or overall quality of the meal, however. Mine, buffalo chicken wings with a side of fries, though, were both cold and without the crisp texture one would expect of such fare. The fries were bland and the wings were nothing I couldn't get at Pizza Pizza.

Overall, I am disappointed with the mediocre service and food at a promising establishment. One star was added for ambience."}
{"text":"Bier market!!
The name says it all.. Beer market. There are hundreds of different beer brands to choose from, which is very unique. On the menu, there are various brands of beer that they recommend you to order that goea well with the dish. 

For food, i ordered the 40oz bine-in rib steak for two that i shared with my buddy. For $76, i thought it was pretty worth it for thr quality that we're getting. It was really tender and juicy and cooked just the way i like it (medium rare), despite the fact that it was a huge piece of meat. 

My friends and i ordered 4 different flavours of mussell, 1/2 kilo for $13. My personal favourite was the proven√ßale flavour. They also gave us some fresh bread to go with the remaining sauce in the dish, which was a nice touch. 
Beer was good, I ordered Jupiler.
Definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"So I was at the Bier Markt tonite. It is definitely a packed place but I think they dont like coloured folks going over there. In this day and age that is so sad especially in a city as diverse as Toronto with all its diversity. The waitress was awesome but the patrons are just crazy. There is this small dance floor. I was dancing on the dance floor and for no apparent reason, this guy just kicked me on my chest. Usually when I go out for the weekend, I spend about a 100 bucks. I guess I will be taking my business else where. Sorry Bier Markt, if you cant treat your patrons nice, they will move else where."}
{"text":"This was my first time here for my bff's birthday and I have heard great things about this place but my overall experience really was just \"meh. I've experienced better.\" 
From the very beginning my gf told me they had bad customer services. She booked 2 tables but not all of the party had arrived yet and the manager kept threatening that they will give away our tables. Terrible customer service, not very happy with how management deals with group parties. They wanted 16 people to sit at table that really fits no more than 10. 
Food is okay here, best dish that we ordered was the smoked meat poutine that was quite good."}
{"text":"I wish I lived in Toronto or Montreal, the selection is great!"}
{"text":"Was at the Bier Markt with some friends this weekend (8 of us in total) for their Fondue Festival.. We were all looking forward to the cheesy goodness but were all sadly disappointed.

My Boyfriend and I ordered the Brie and Lobster $23, and the Normandy $23. 
Another couple ordered Gorgonzola, all in all we all order all the main fondues that were featured. Not a single person was impressed with result. 

Our Normandy came first, all you could taste was Mustard. No cheese flavour came out.. the \"fresh baguette\" were cold and untoasted, plain white cold baguette was unappealing.. you were given two skewers with three one inch slices of a sausage, which was hardly filling but was the only item that tasted someone decent.. The small portion of green apples were also lacking. 

The second fondue that came which we were looking forward to was the Lobster and Brie. Sadly again tasteless. ice cold fingerling potatoes slightly mushed, cherry tomatoes and again cold plain white baguette. with four tiny lobster croquettes  ..this is $23? not worth it. again flavourless and extremely disappointed. 

My friend's Gorgonzola came and we thought for sure it was be full of flavour.. it tasted like Rue. Could not pick out any sharp taste you would expect from Gorgonzola... needless to say she was extremely upset. 

The only redeeming item we had that night was the beer.. although my second drink came with an extra seasoning of old lipgloss stuck to the rim of my glass.. Not mine that's for sure, I wasn't wearing any sort of lipstick or lip balm or anything! Gross!! - you'd think i'd get a discount out of it? .. nothing.

For two people, for two fondue orders, and two beer each... came to $88.86 Tax and gratuity already included (a 15% tacked onto the bill without even a word)

MAKE NOTE!!! Check your bill.. they add on 15% even if you think the service is good or terrible. 

Let's say this.. Go there only for Beer.. but check your glasses as soon as it is placed down in front of you. Do not bother ordering food unless you have no tastebuds. 

Fondue, a definitely SKIP IT!"}
{"text":"The beer selection is awesome! I had two pints of some sort of British beer which was  good. However, the salad was mediocre. I asked for a NY strip salad and it was so overcooked!! The salad portion was extremely small. The service is good, but I think a hockey night has everyone distracted."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food, great area of Toronto and great beer selection! If you are looking for a nice IPA go for the Boneshaker. If not, you still have over 100 beers to choose from."}
{"text":"If you plan on going during a Bell Center hockey night, forget about it. But how fun is it to be able to try all these beers! Food is above acceptable for a 'bar'"}
{"text":"Came here with friends while visiting from Boston.  The drinks were a bit pricey but overall we had a good experience here - would probably go back again especially if I lived in the city."}
{"text":"We called half an hr before reservation to make sure they have room for a stroller to fit since we have two babies in the group, the guy on the phone went and ask the manager and they said they will try their best to accommodate space and that a stroller wouldn't be a problem. Ok since they said that then we decided to try. This is the first time we have dined at bier markt. But when we arrived there, there wasn't even room for a car seat and the table they gave us is tight! Even I had to squeeze in (I'm 5')....honestly their food is just ok (I've been to better restaurant in this price range) and I have to admit their beer is good since their name is bier markt but that's about it. At least tell us honestly that there are no room for stroller so we could've picked somewhere that's baby friendly. The guy at the front who took us to the table doesn't even care whether our car seat fits into the booth seat or not. At the end of the night, this was suppose to be for my birthday celebration, which we told ahead of time and when we went there they said it's their company's policy not to serve cake! Omg"}
{"text":"The 2 stars is for overall experience. The food was fantastic. Service was a joke.
We sat in the bar area at a table. Absolutely no communication with our waitress/bartender. Never commented on \"how we were\", and never seemed to notice when our glasses were bone dry. Even after coming to the table to take away our plates. \"Do they train servers/bartenders anymore\"? Not to mention...when you don't have a beer(s) better to have a sign or have bartender let you know before ordering. I'd like a pint of .......please. \"Oh,...no we are out of that one.
Well we TRIED to order 5 different beers that the Bier Markt WAS out of. It is frustrating to order and THEN be told. When you let guests know before hand via a board/bartender communication this doesn't bother guest at all.
Please train staff properly!! I believe you were short staffed. Not good enough for the prices you charge. I would love to go back if this could get rectified."}
{"text":"Remember when there wasn't a Bier Markt everywhere you looked? It used to be great as a bar/pub but in the last couple years it's started to fall apart. The clientele has gotten too pretentious and their food isn't worth eating. Servers don't know enough about their non-mainstream beer. I asked for a suggestion and she suggested Stella! STELLA????? 
We were there on Saturday - table of six, waiting for one person - and as we were browsing the menu we asked the server for water and she copped an attitude about it. Sliders were over cooked and cold. We didn't bother with dinner after that...just a few more drinks and then headed out."}
{"text":"This location pales to the original spot downtown. Obviously the beer is the only draw here and this is the only bar capable of properly serving a Leffe beer. However the food is average and the prices not commensurate with the quality. I had the wings and the tuna, both were bland. My wife had the flat bread, also bland. Perhaps the problem originates from the idiot consultant who encouraged the owners to expand beyond the one location. The brand gets proportionately deluded the more stores there are with the greatest damage occurring when the second store opens. This brands was very cool when it had only one location, but greedy expansion has laid this restaurant low. A message to all cool restaurant out there - when that dipstick restaurant consultant shows up and expounds the \"virtues\" of expansion, do your patrons and yourself a favour and throw a glass of beer in his face (please not Leffe) and promptly escort him from the premises, for he is only the destroyer of class, the destroyer of culinary art and a first rate buffoon, dealing is buffoonery."}
{"text":"Excellent for a round of beer after work! It is either the location or the tight blue dresses that make this place expensive.

I have come here for brunch and lunch so I tried it for a late dinner. Food is good but the real attraction is the extensive beer selection.  I enjoyed a Rodenbach grand cru sour beer that went perfectly with the salmon I had.  It is a pricey place, $15 for an appetizer? Really?  

For two, we spent over $80, we just ordered one appetizer to share, 2 mains,
and one beer ( not even an expensive one). Come here for a \"business\" lunch if you can expense it."}
{"text":"This location is slipping.  I think they can get their game back with some attention to detail..Ordered oysters just kind of slapped on a plate, they used to have great sauces that I craved...no more apparently.  Not even lemons for my oysters but I did love the horseradish... Our waitress was nice but not particularly interested in us, she suggested we move to a larger table which we needed too but when she suggested we move she clearly meant WE move ourselves, our drinks, our plates, our appetizers so we did.  The food was good.  Their Beer 58 sauce is fabulous and should be bathed in and given as gifts to the uninitiated.  Bottle it and sell it and get your game back you had until very recently"}
{"text":"Very greasy food, especially the burgers and fries. I like their selection of beers and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Had a First Date here and this place was Great!! Usually when I visit I would order only Beer (of course)  and never really had a chance to try their food. With my past experiences with bar food I wasnt expecting much but the dishes actually blew me away. We ordered the calamari (had a craving for calamari all week) and the Gouda Bombs. Both dishes came out quick and were delicious. The service was great as I asked for recommendations for a \"fruity\" beer as I had enjoyed the Grapefruit Radler from my last visit. The waitress brought out a sampler of beers which both myself and my date enjoyed. Last but definitely not the least was the Live Band who were great. GUYS, I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS PLACE FOR A FIRST DATE! Service, food, atmosphere and experience were ALL Excellent!"}
{"text":"Food: A
Service: A
Food presentation: A
Atmosphere: A
Prices: C
Recommended?:  Yes

This place lives up to the name with a wide selection of beers. The food is also pretty good. And they have a live band usually on the weekend managing the high energy atmosphere. My only complaint is that both the beers and the food items are unnecessarily too pricy. Eg. ~$25 Kobe Burger, although was pretty good, it was definitely not worth $25. Bottom line, this is a place every beer lover should visit once. But go with a full stomach and pre-drink!!"}
{"text":"This is a new location at Shops at Don Mills and it's very similar to the downtown locations. Compared to the Esplande location this one is a bit smaller but looks and feels pretty much the same. What I like about this one is the location and the fact that there are no line ups (yet) and you can easily find free parking. Like the Esplande location there's a fantastic selection of beers, and a live band. For more details refer to my recent review on the Esplande location."}
{"text":"Les calmars durs donc trop cuits, burger de Wagyu sec m√™me carbonis√© , le flamme au smoke meat serait pas pire mais il y'a trop peu de viande v.s. la moutarde forte et la salade de choux

En gros , une Cage aux sports avec un DJ qui vous fait payer 3 fois le prix avec plus d'artifices

Le service est bien, ce n'est pas de la faute des serveuses et serveurs si la bouffe est aussi m√©diocre"}
{"text":"Food is delicious but expensive and beer selection is great but thus far after 2 visits (one patio, one indoor) the service is EXTREMELY slow"}
{"text":"So my friend planned his bday there (Sat nite). My friend and I arrived early so we decided to sit on the patio before the party people arrived. After having a few over priced beers, decided to pay the tab and join the party. Only to be told we would have to wait in line if we wanted to go inside..the bouncer then treated me as if i were a common criminal escorting me out (after at least me getting to say happy bday to my friend) needless to say i will never visit this place again for such stupidity. As for the bouncer, he's gonna be exactly that for the rest of his life, enjoy your power trip :D"}
{"text":"Wow. I just went to the Bier Markt and I am SO disappointed. First off, the pricing is ridiculous. You'd think for how much they charge you, the food would be spectacular. Let me tell you, ITS NOT. The food was so below average. The staff was great, no complaint there but wow the food sucks. Great beers or not, if a restaurant doesn't sell good food, they are not going to last long."}
{"text":"Newly renovated place and it looks beautiful. Would have wanted to give it a 4 but it was at best a 3.5 due to the food. Staff was supper friendly but disorganized had three different waitresses asking if we had being helped. I ordered the Mussels Proven√ßal for starter and the Schnitzel with spatzle, potatoes and lemon caper sauce. The mussels were dry and lacked flavour and the pork schnitzel was well seasoned but a little dry. The lemon caper sauce was great and made up for the rest of the dish. The atmosphere is great ,the beer selections a 5 star  and the prices are reasonable. To make this a 4  more attention needs to be placed on the food!"}
{"text":"ok the food here is amazing ! 
i have had a few thing , big fun of their fondue ,  mussels are amazing and their cider Bellini   is great.

Service is hit and miss , sometimes amazing , sometimes they act like your are disturbing them to flirt with the many \"jersey shore\" guys that hang out at the bar...."}
{"text":"Once a solid Toronto institution now nothing more than a German pub/frat party.

I recall the days when the bier Markt helped to advance beer culture in Toronto. The servers were knowledgable and interested in the customers experience. These days they seem to want to get you in and out as fast as possible. The beer program that was once a cornucopia of interesting beers can now be found at many Toronto bars. 

The menus still points in the same direction it did 10 years ago. Schnitzel, flat breads, wings. Not bad in taste but far from interesting. I'm sure east Europe has created a new dish or two in the last 50 years.

Worst part of all is the post 9:00 crowd on weekends. They follow the exceptionally loud bands. It feels like a sea of men, beer and testosterone. I will say that the latter point seems to work for them, just not how I want to finish my night.

Bier Market, please remember you roots, train better, develop better and bring the passion back."}
{"text":"What a shitshow!

We were seated in the corner near the entrance, probably the worst seats possible. A lot of people were leaving shortly after, server never offered to inform us that booths were freeing up.

After being seated, my girlfriend and I sat around for 20-30 minutes. Nobody offered us water. Nobody even took a drink order. We were completely ignored. We had enough time to read through the entire menu and everything before we got fed up.

The amazing part was that we were seated next to the POS terminal so the servers were in close proximity to us the entire time! We watched other tables get drinks, water, everything. And like I pointed out, a lot of booths freed up so it was impossible to figure out why we were so neglected when there was so much open space.

So naturally, after the 20+ minutes of waiting around to get a beer at a joint with BEER in its name, we decided to leave. The hostess didn't care though, she didn't even acknowledge us as we stormed out.

We ended up driving to another restaurant. So much better. Never going back to this overpriced mess."}
{"text":"The wife and I ate here for lunch and had a few beers. It was nice and quiet inside, lots of business lunch types in suits. We had the schnitzel sliders with potato salad and the sausages. The food was fantastic, though a little pricey, but worth it. Great beer selection too. If you like Beer Bistro you might want to check this place out."}
{"text":"Amazing Amazing Amazing! It's crazy how they turned this location into a Bier Markt so quick"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I highly recommend the crab dip. The beer selection was really good and I love that each beer has its own glass. Often in America beers are just put into any glass (usually a Miller Lite or something cheap) so that was a great touch. 
The food also fits with the German theme. The decor was well suited and the outdoor patio seemed spacious. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"I wrote a review for urbanspoon on my first visit here in July because I was so unimpressed by the music. Then I accidentally ended up going back a week later and although the band was different, the music was no better. Our server the second time actually asked how we were enjoying the band and I told her honestly it was terrible. It was a relief when the singer stopped wailing and some old school hip-hop started on the stereo. The band was like bad karaoke of current pop songs and too loud and badly-sung to have a proper conversation and when you're at a bar enjoying some watery cider you should either be able to enjoy the music or the company. When you can't enjoy either it is pretty sad. Please just play regular music!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I'll be looking for any excuse to visit again.  Our server was super-knowledgeable about their immense beer selection and good for pairing recommendations.  The food made me drool."}
{"text":"Good for a quick drink after work, but overpriced,  catering towards the 5 √† 7 crowd. The food is very generic. The one thing going for it is its large beer selection."}
{"text":"Decent place to eat for the cost. I ordered two starters as my meal, along with a pint of cider, and with tax and tip was $30, very reasonable. 

I have to be critical, their appetizer pretzels are awesome however the mustard served with them was full of horseradish or something, and it was FAR too hot for me. However, one of the people I was eating with loved it, so that's more personal taste than anything. I did have a pretty bad experience when dipping my pretzel for the first time as there was no warning on the menu or from the server as to how hot this stuff is. 

I also ordered an appetizer sized candied bacon poutine which was plenty large enough for my meal. Fries were nice and all the toppings went well together. 

I would visit again."}
{"text":"I was there 2 weeks ago..
Waitress forgot my beer order and then ordered the wrong food size (asked for appetizer size mussels) got full size.
Worse part was she did not seem to care, and we did not get a reduction in cost for her mistake.
Lucky I don't dine here that much, and after that I may just go elsewhere as there are lots of locations in the area..."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype of this place.

I see people line up Fridays and Saturdays at night to get in... This place if full of real top notch d bags that you'll find at the club district. Seeing as I live in this neighbourhood, they're reaaaaaal keepers. I'm always catching them peeing in public with no shame. 

Anyway, I've come here twice before because I heard that the mussels here are really good. Mega disappointment, and I love mussels. I've had some of the oysters here and they're ok. 

Came in for brunch, and they didn't even have fresh squeezed orange juice... Trust me for the price that they charge for the food here - they should have it. They food isn't that good either for brunch, I had the breakfast greens and my bf had some rosti sausage egg thing. Everything here is very bland. We finished with the donuts, which were hard and I didn't like and I feel like my bf only enjoyed them because it came with some kind of coffee sauce. 

Second time we came here it was for dinner. I got the veal schnitzel and my bf got the burger. The 10 oz. Kobe burger is not that great... My favourite burger in this city is Burger's Priest, Origin Restaurant and Holy Chuck.... And they're burger is no where near this amount (25) and x10 better. Veal schnitzel... only thing good about this is the mash potatoes that come with it... which doesn't say much. My mom makes a better veal schnitzel and it tastes fresh, this veal tastes like it's been frozen then fried. 

The service here is good. The servers are friendly, and attentive. Now, I don't know how knowledgeable they are about the beers, but they're nice and it made the experience better since the food was just bad. That's the only thing I like about this place. lol.... the servers... Says a lot. The food is overpriced and not good."}
{"text":"The first time I went to the Bier Markt, I was a little nervous.  Since returning to Canada after six months in Belgium, I was unable to find any good French-Belgian and Flemish food.  

The moment I first walked in and saw Mannequin-Pis, I was home.  The Bier Markt served my favourite beer, Leffe Brun, and had many more amazing European beers available.  The atmosphere was relaxed and I liked the Esplanade location.  It was secluded from heavy traffic which is a bonus.

Food I've had there include the flat bread, mussels and fries.  Love the flat bread.  It was delish!  The mussels were great.  The only thing that would help make it more authentic is that fries should be automatically served with the mussels.  

Moreso adding to the awesomeness that is the Bier Markt is it's great staff.  The few times I've been there, I had really great service.  

If you want a chills night, with good European food, and great beer, go to the Bier Markt.  Until I can find another Belgian style restaurant, you'll see me there."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Prices are what you expect for a place like this. Fast and helpful service. Patio is great during the hotter months. Plenty of beer."}
{"text":"Great place for a good time. Service was pretty good we got our food pretty quick, we sat at a bar too and we ordered quite a few food items. There was a live band that came on at 10 and they were very good, the band (brent miller & the cool ones) took and played nearly every song i requested. Too bad no one got up to jam out on the dance floor, i guess it was just the crowd.

There was soo much beer for the picking i didnt even know where to start, the foods were more on the german inspired side, which isnt bad at all. The semi dark environment was very nice and cool. Their washroom was very clean and sanitized, but the had the washrooms labelled differently and i was too sure i was going into the male washroom.

Overall very fun night and i would most definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. I've been here twice and the service was super slow. Food is not bad and drink menu is extensive but won't be back given that it took the waitress 30 minutes to take our drink order."}
{"text":"Great food but waiting 40 minutes before we even got in our drink order is shameful.

I've been to better Bier Markt locations and this one was the worst.

Needs servers that can handle a busy night.

When our poutines were finally ready, they sent it to another table. Realized the mistake and let them eat our food FOR FREE while we waited another 15 minutes and no one acknowledged or apologized for making us wait.

Dessert was over cooked.

Even if I'm in the area, will avoid this place based off service.

Beer 25/10 (Great selection)

Service 1/10"}

Pro tip: don't sit by the railings. Lots of people begging for drinks and money. 
Preeminent food critic Dean Maltby make the classic mistake of adding poutine to his burger.  Eyes are bigger than his belly. 

PS. He also ordered a litre of beer and tried to get his wife to finish it. \"That's too much beer.\" he said."}
{"text":"No hard feelings on the chain, but our bier could have been better.

ATMOSPHERE
The Bier Markt is definitely a high rolling pub. Not a place to throw on the lumberjack plaid and roll over to the bar for Budweiser (ew anyway). I had on my black running shoes and felt a little dressed down.  

Easily strategic date-location material. Not sure if they're into you or they might be taken? The Bier Markt shows you're classy but not snooty, and if you want to show off your mad beer skills, this is the time. Its got dark wood, usually with red touches in the d√©cor. Nothing scratched or sticky with old beer. Strategically dim lighting to suggest a minimal, laid back, loungey feeling, but lacking the trendy servers in thigh-highs. 
Good thing about the Markts is they're big and easily able to accommodate groups if it's not busy. We were there around 9pm and the patio was jammed so we descended into the underground main area and landed ourselves some stools right away, because we weren't in the mood for a full meal. 

The other good thing about the Bier Markts that helps to take down their schmoncy edge: they bring in cover bands. Not a three piece jazz trio or an ambient DJ, but honest to goodness top 40s/oldies music. Who doesn't love live music? The band was playing right in our ear but they were fantastic. The Replicas, please come back to a pub near me anytime! Some grinning ladies even broke the ice and danced a bit in front of the stage, which was less of a stage than a slightly raised platform crammed into the corner near the entrance, unlike the Markt on the Esplanade which has a mad big dance floor.

FOOD
We ordered the Wurst Sampler.  Sausages not too salty but can't say much more about them than that. Boring and greasy. This should have been the highlight of the dish but it was definitely the opposite. Even the three mustards, the pickles and shredded beets served with them couldn't save them from their lack of taste. 
Small piece of a firm, yet creamy cheese was nice, and the baked oversized pretzels were quite delicious with warm, soft insides and lightly toasty outsides. However for the price you pay, and given that this is a resto on King, I was expecting a little better from those sausages. This is also not the first time I have been underwhelmed by Bier Markt food.

Our beer on the other hand was very nice. Oh, the uber long list! Being a beer snob, I generally make an effort not to go to just ANY bar. (Canadian and Corona only? That's okay, I'll have soda water) But again, we were disappointed because despite the Bier Markt's substantial list, my friend had to make changes to his order five times (five!) because they didn't have the beers he wanted. 

SERVICE
Our server was incredibly sweet and it wasn't for lack of trying that our experience at this particular resto was below par. She refilled our water three times and checked in on us once as well. There was an error on our split bills, but we just worked out the difference.  

LOCATION
Oh King West. We went for a nice walk along Queen from St. Patrick where we caught a $6.00 Green P. It was a walk I could not have attempted in heels or if I was in a crappy mood. By the time we cleared out, the district was starting to really hop with guys in shiny cars and girls in little black dresses and pumps. We made our getaway back towards the Horseshoe, having no wish to be mistaken for sad lost tourists. 

Located at King and Spadina, it is not all that convenient by subway, which is unfortunate for us suburbanites. Take the King streetcar west is your best bet for landing right at the front door in your Steve Maddens. 

OVERALL
I wouldn't mind going back but it wouldn't be my first choice. If I was thinking about a pricey beer bar to go to with a live band, I would make the Esplanade Markt higher on my list. The Bier Markt is dependable if you are out with a group and looking to strike a balance between lounge and bar, but don't expect much from the food. Save your hard-earned dollars for the beer."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place, I had a delicious lobster fondu which was rich and tasty. The beer selection is overwhelming but they have a sampler for 20 dollars which was a good choice to savour a variety of  delicious beers, and then next time you will have an idea of what to order. Stay away from their flammekueches, its dry, un-flavourful and sad. Steak is meh. You come here for the beer, so maybe stick with appetizers or the fondu."}
{"text":"Went to bier markt 1st time ever this past weekend also 1st restaurant review so here goes - walked in approx. 7pm bar is packed dining has tables open we have no reservations and are told we have to wait because of policy or we could have 1hr only at a table before \" reserved guests \" arrive we choose to wait at corner of bar for open table when ready and review the menus of beer and food , lots to read  for beer , honest the selections can be overwhelming But very interesting I select the innis and gunn from Scotland ( good price for quality until the mini beer glass arrives ) but still even lcbo cost over 3 bucks a bottle! On to the food , we started with the flat breads smoked meat and slaw which was tasty good and fair priced half way into it we get called for the table ok great settle the tab move to table order another round of I and G , mains we try the Hot wings with side of pretzels and pear, beet salad with salmon which was all good above average flavor except pretzels could be kicked up a notch , mustard dip was ok , tried the lemon tart dessert made from scratch to share which was sweet and pleasant to end meal. Overall crowd was loungy The leafs game was on first of the season but you would never know it because vibe was like nobody even cared so settled bill with waitress who was knowledgable of food and drinks with proper service and went on our way. I would go back try some other beers and menu items at least it more unique then so many of the other standard casual bars and restaurants a definite must try at least once or twice. 
Cheers all"}
{"text":"Kind of a rip. Our server was very polite, but the food was pretty bad. Fries were soggy and not crisp- at all. Burger, oh lord. GUYS. You can NOT SERVE BURGERS WITH HUGE CHUNKS OF CARTILAGE INISDE IT. SO nasty. My brother and I had to spit several pieces out and do that childish pick through your food thing to see that yes, they were continuous chunks of nasty s$it throughout our patties. Beer selection is top notch, but the food really sucks. 65$ for two poorly mader burgers (buns were good) and 2 pints? Not returning ever again."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner. He had the steak and I had the salmon. Both meals were fantastic! The fries were good also. I liked the atmosphere in the place also (we were at the queensway one). There was quite a good selection of beers, we were not disappointed with the wide selection at all. My boyfriend was very impressed! 
The only thing that I'd say I was slightly disappointed about was the small selection of menu items. It lacked a simple chicken or pasta meal!.. Don't get me wrong, the salmon was delicious and I loved my meal.. I just feel that some may not be able to find something they like on the menu because it lacks variety.
If you are a beer drinking, up for trying beers from some different countries that are less common here, I would definitely recommend stopping in for some beers here. You can get beer sampler caddies, which contain 6 samples of different beer (preselected beers with certain themes). About $20 for 6 samples and the sample sizes are larger than I expected.
The place is pricey but worth it! I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"As my first experience at a Bier Markt(Yes, it's a chain!) I don't have any major complaints about the restaurant. The staff, very friendly and professional. The ambiance, loud! The background music was being covered by the voices of the clients.. So a bit too much noise in the background for my taste.  
The food in general was fantastic! Served warm, average size portions, not too small and not overly big.. Simply perfect! Nicely presentable as well. 
The varieties of beers is fantastic, yet overwhelming! 50+ varieties of beer, which one to choose? Ask the waitresses and they will guide you quite nicely. 
This is not a pub, a bar or a place to chill. This is an upscale restaurant with authentic food from Belgium. Again not a single complaint about the food or the staff. What's the VERY disappointing part of my entire experience? The parking! An absolute NIGHTMARE!. Why? Well the restaraunt does not have it's own parking lot or valet. So they offer you to park at the Sheraton(Next door) and show them that you went to the restaurant and the hotel will parking cost in half. Not quite! The parking costed me $30(For two hours!) And the parking staff refused to give me a discount, regardless of what the restaurant had told me. Yes, I showed them proof I was a client at the restaurant and the parking staff said( Sorry, we can't do anything about it.. $30 please!) 
Unless you're VERY curious about this restaurant, or willing to walk a bit by having to take the metro or bus.. Find another place where parking is accessible and a good value as well. The whole parking situation really turned me off. Consider the manager of the restaurant only said \"Sorry you experienced that, we will talk with the parking staff\" Ok, but where's my discount?! I was suppose to pay(Told by the restaurant) $10.00 NOT $30.00. Think wisely before you go here."}
{"text":"If you love beer, you'd love this place. Very wide selection of beers, ales, lagers and all other variations of this drink from all over the world. With this selection of beer, food becomes of no importance, but it is still very good there. Their menu matches beer to every food item, even to desserts, which surprised me. Too bad I had enough by the time we asked for the sweets menu to try that combination. 

The place seems always busy. 

They have themed food \"faestiv√ºls\", like shellfish, fondue etc. Probably nice to try once. I've been there during shellfish one, but I opted for a salad as I am not a big fan of shellfish. Must admit the salad was good.

Price-wise, it is probably on the expensive side, but if you want quality, you have to pay for it."}
{"text":"The selection of beer is extensive! The handbook they give to choose your poison is descriptive and easy to navigate. I will say the waitresses didn't really inspire confidence in regards to what they had for drinks (I don't expect them to memorize the whole book...). The food is delicious and pairings are suggested. What stopped this place from getting a 4 on 5 is that certain beers on the menu were questionable. For example, a bottle of Corona was simply overpriced. Not really a menu exclusively for craft beers. But hey, one man's trash is another man's treasure. I would go again with friends."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of beer.  Food is really meh.  We ordered the double burger and the schnitzel.  On menu, the description looked great.  But burger came out overcooked and dry, and the schnitzel was ok but the sp√§tzle side was dry as well.  Service was friendly but very very slow."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place while wandering the streets.  There was a huge crowd outside enjoying the nice weather.  The entrance leads downstairs to a nice bar; a little commercial but there was a live cover band playing rock favorites and a laid-back crowd having a good time.  Good selection of world beers, didn't try the food.  Smaller than the Bier Markt on Esplanade."}
{"text":"So I think I liked this Bier Markt better than the one on King Street.  It sort of looks like a castle on the inside and the outdoor patio made for a nice afternoon stop.  Great selection of beers from around the world.  I ordered the sausage sampler and some frites; pretty good, not the best I've had.  It gets a little pricy, though."}
{"text":"Went there tonight (3 of us) to order 3 apps and two pitchers of beer and sit on the patio. There was available tables and as we were being brought out we were ask if we would be ordering entrees and we said pitchers and apps and were then told they had a new policy that you had to order an entree in order to be allowed access to the patio. So after questioning the policy we said we would go to Earl's at Square One. Glad we did, nicer patio and better prices. I would give no stars if I could.

Was thinking it's called the bier (beer) market and are they not known more for bier more than food? And don't most restaurants make more money off drinks?? Than food??? Read post from Internet below..

 Alcoholic Beverage Sales

The price of alcoholic beverages provides the largest area for profit potential in a full-service restaurant. For example, a standard keg of beer holds 165 servings at 12 ounces or 124 servings at 16 ounces, according to Realbeer.com. If your restaurant charges $4 per glass, a standard keg earns you between $490 and $660 if you charge the same price per serving size. If the keg costs your restaurant $100 to purchase, this gives you a profit margin of as much as 500 percent.
***********************************************

Not sure if the above numbers are right. But either way in this economy and day and age can any business turn away customers with crazy policies ??? 

After being denied a free table I wanted to sit at I won't be back. 

Come on bier market.

PS Bier Market.... We got apps and beer at Earl's and were allowed to sit on their patio and spent $70.00 and now we will most defiantly return to Earl's. Thanks for helping us discover Earl's!!!"}
{"text":"The food is great, but the only ick is the smell of sewer! The easy solution is to invest in a neutralizing odour chemical that is organic and completely safe."}
{"text":"Perfect place to become deaf. With or without the band, the music is *beyond* deafening. I'm sorry if I'm being a jackass for not understanding, but it's still my opinion.

On the bright side, there is a large selection of beer."}
{"text":"Wish I could write a review about the food or drink, but since we didn't get served (or even acknowledged) for 10 minutes after being seated, resulting in us leaving without ordering, I can only rate the service. So here's my review: it's non-existent. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Terrific food, delicious most of the time. Wasn't a fan of their boar pie."}
{"text":"The service was bad I went on Monday and I know the burger are on special and I ask if any special and they said no and tell her ,I have a app they said burger on special and she said ooo yes ,really    Bad"}
{"text":"Although familiar with the downtown Toronto location had never tried the new Mississauga locale.

Took a client there last week and had a great experience.

Reservation was on the books. Was greater warmly and seated immediately. Staff knew the specials and as would be expected had knowledge of beer pairings for our meals. 

Food arrived in an acceptable amount of time and was excellent. Prices were very fair in my opinion. 

Staff were friendly and made for a great mid day business meeting. Parking readily available. 

Will definitely return.  Could probably be five stars."}
{"text":"Is it a restaurant? A pub? a club? Who can tell? It's not doing a very good job being any of the above, if you ask me. 

As a restaurant, it's really LOUD! As a pub, it's way too crowded with not enough seating. And as a club, it's just a bit awkward with all those people eating and standing around while you try to.... dance? 

Side note: It's funny how many times the word \"douche\" is mentioned in these reviews. Really sets a reputation for the place."}
{"text":"The two of us Went here for a late dinner and was hoping for seat amidst the busy boxing  day dinner crowd...
Yep. Got a spot and while it was nice to get a spot, it was very noisy...oh well..what do you expect on a Boxing Day week :)

They were short staffed but I was a bit surprised as we had a party of 20 sitting beside us (yes the Source of the loud noise). 
It took about over 5 minutes to get s server but she was quick on the mark to introduce us to their menu and of course beer. 

We ordered flat brad (chicken flat bread wi a fancy name) and their signature Belgium mussels and fries. It was overall tasty but the flat bed was a bit on the salty side. The dinner did come with a delicious small loaf of bread. 

The mussels with lobster cream was good but you could not taste the Pernod in the cream much. It was slightly overcooked for my taste because it was falling out from the shell in mass. 

The beer selection was good but the server could not recommend a Definitive type other than lager will be good. I believe a bit more training may help or she was just plain tired ...but she was courteous. 

Overall it is a place that I will visit again but not sure if I will order a $15 flatbread which had 6 pieces of small shredded chicken and 10 pieces of sliced mushroom. It would have fed one skinny person with a few glasses of beer. The similar food at Terroni would be less. But it is the only game in town across sherway gardens so thou shall pay a bit more for the convenience. 

Suggestion: less salt in the flat bread, let customers know that is is appetizer size, may be add a few more pieces of chicken or cheese to dress it up. 

Mussels is great so keep up the good work and don't over cook it....

I will be back to check on the progress !"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and location. They have changed the menu and it appears as though they are just trying to cut back on food while maintaining prices. We both ordered the chicken schnitzel and it was literally a dry, overcooked chicken finger with 5 small potatoes on the plate. We paid $65 for this \"meal\" and went home and made our own food. This place has really gone downhill, only concerned about their bottom line. So sad to see this happen."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, terrible layout, overpriced mediocre food and rude staff that don't seem to care about their jobs."}
{"text":"BeirMkt is a great place. Just not this location. All of the other locations I've been have just been more fun. Maybe just a bad experience. The beer choices are always top notch but when it came to the food... My Poutine trio came with cold gravy.. Cold Gravy!!!!! This should not happen. I Kind of feel cheated by going to the Queensway location of my money and the normally fun vibes of BeirMkt . The square one location is a far better choice if you are living in the west end."}
{"text":"Would be good if they would hire more bartenders. EXTREMELY SLOW. To the point where I decide to go home sober. Get it together already."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  The beer selection is amazing,  they have all the beers. 

Food is also delicious,  the food menu is very good.  I ordered the burger and it was delicious. Good portion size and what you would expect. 

Downside is that it is quite expensive.  The have good service.  I wouldn't go here in a big group,  it's a good spot for 4-6 people."}
{"text":"If good looking, professional eye candy is yourthing, the Bier Market is your place. If ear-splitting pop tunes from the 80's isn't your thing, then Bier Market is not your place.

I met a large group for dinner and were told we'd have to vacate the table we had at 7pm. That would've been okay if we hadn't made the reservation until 9. Anyway. 

I had an Edinger, which was a delicious German pale ale, and the tomato and goat cheese flat bread for dinner. It had a ton of goat cheese on it -- too much if you ask me -- but was decent. For dessert, we shared their special of little donuts stuffed with granny smith apples. Those were fantastic! 

Our waitress was totally scatterbrained; she made some people pay for their drinks when she served them and others with their bill. Then, she told two of us that \"for the life of her, she couldn't get our bills to separate\" and then charged me for the beer I'd already paid for and didn't charge me for the flatbread. Surely she's used to handling large parties here because there were about five of them just around us!

Overall, this was a decent place to try some good beer. Next time, I'll just have to remember to bring my noise-canceling earphones."}
{"text":"Bier Markt has definitely declined from its former glory.
The place was packed on a Saturday night, which is a good sign. The band that was playing was great and the overall environment seemed good.

Until it came time to order.
I've always had a thing for dark ales/lagers, brunes, dubbels and quadrupels. It used to be that I could get my fix at the Bier Markt.

This night, I came in and ordered a Gulden Draak.
Server said, sorry, don't have that.
Ok, no worries, I'll have a Kasteelbier Donker....nope, don't have that in stock either.

Umm...alright, let's see, how about Leffe Brune Abbey?

The server said, sure...came back 10 minutes later, sorry, don't have that.
OK......well...4th time is the charm right? Abbaye Des Rocs please.

NOPE!!!!

Holy heck!
At least the had the more mainstream La Maudite, St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout and Trois Pistoles.

That said, I was not impressed at all that they didn't have my first choice, not to mention the next 3 down!

The flight of 6 cheese board was a pretty good deal I felt at $19.00, though strangely enough there wasn't enough bread. 

Their \"Markt Charcuterie\" platter however left me wanting. Priced at $22.00, there were 3-4 very thin slices of prosciutto, capicolla, salami, and chorizo, and AGAIN not enough bread!!! Considering those are not expensive meats, I expected more slices of each. 

It's an \"ok\" place to visit, but I wouldn't rave about it as I used to in the past. The Bier Menu just doesn't deliver what it shows, the stock is just not there, and the kitchen is pretty standard for a gastropub."}
{"text":"My wife and I went out for a \"date night\" shortly after having our second child and couldn't have been happier.  The food was unbelievable, especially their sausage board...my goodness, just melt in your mouth.  

Our server was punctual, helpful, knowledgeable and most importantly, pleasant.  On a busy Thursday night she ensured we knew we hadn't been forgotten and regularly checked to see if there was anything else we needed.  This was particularly helpful as I was drinking an obscure Eastern European beer which I adore and have rarely seen out of Europe. 

Plenty of options to choose from on the food menu and a seemingly endless beer menu.  Can't wait to go back for a \"boys night\"."}
{"text":"Nice place and a wide selection of beers. The food was not too bad. Customer service was excellent, but the food was a bit pricy."}
{"text":"I like this place! I've been to their Esplanade location multiple times, I'm so excited now that they added a new location in mid town. 

Four of us went there last Sunday, and we were seated right away. We shared a Normandy cheese fondue. The sausage was so so, but we loved the bread and the apple! The cheese taste good too, it's not too old, so it's easy for everyone. We asked a second round of bread too. I think they would give you a second round of apple too (I hope they do). 

For main, we got an order of the steak frites, the roasted beet salad, the ahi tuna and a flat bread. I love the steak, but I am not a big fan of beet. They did put a lot of beets in the salad, more beets than green, so don't get it if you are like me. I did not try the ahi tuna and the flat bread, but they look good and I had it before at their other location. 

We also got a round of their beer sampler - Europe bound. It's $20 for 6 different kinds of beer. I can't remember their names, but within our samples, there is only one kind that I like. It's cool to share, especially on a Sunday night, no one plans to stay out too late."}
{"text":"Such an awful place to pick! The music band sound is extremely loud inside. If you seat out side your chance to see your server would be only 2-3 times during the whole night! The server has a little knowledge about the menu and beers. The sever even neither bring us napkins with the appraisers nor  forks and knives till we requested! This bar was dead  and a few people were there even on a Thursday night. Beer paints are too small (I guess 350 mil). Considering their tribble service it ended up with a bill that gratitude was automatically added (18 percent) to our bill!  I never come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend on Friday night without reservation so it took a while for us to get seated but it shouldn't be too bad if you made a reservation.

Both of us had flat bread(chicken and shrimp). I have to say the sauce was delicious and with a decent amount of stuff on it. I wish they had more though.

The place is very very loud so you almost have to scream to the person sitting sitting across from you. Wouldn't recommend it if you are on a date or actually had something to talk about.

Server and doormen were super nice and made you feel welcome."}
{"text":"I went here a few nights ago with a group of five others. We had a reservation and we were seated exactly on time without waiting, which was nice, since some places tend not to honour reservations. The ambience was warm and there was a live band. It was a decent, clean, pub-like atmosphere. 

Our server was very patient and helpful. We ordered a round of beers and started off with charcuterie and the lobster and brie fondue. Both of these were great, especially the fondue. What I found strange was that they didn't bring around any water unless it was explicitly asked for.

Things started going downhill when we ordered the entrees and they came out in groups of two with around five minutes between each. I got my entree a good ten minutes after two of my friends got theirs, after they seemed to have forgotten about my order. This makes for an awkward dining experience and obviously no one likes to have their order forgotten by the wait staff.  I ordered the roasted beet salad, which was mediocre at best. It was absolutely nothing special. The rest of the table felt the same about their entrees. One of my friends noted that the mussels were good, however, and the portion was very big, so it's more appropriate to share between two or even three people. 

We split some dessert afterwards and I really have to say that this was the most disappointing part of the evening. I tried part of the strawberry shortcake and it was probably the worst dessert I have ever eaten anywhere. I would not recommend it at all. The semifreddo trio was also disappointing, as it was more like a hardened room temperature creme with very overbearing compote than anything like a semifreddo. I also had a bite of the s'mores waffle, which was actually kind of good, but only because it was the least offensive. 

In sum, this is a good place to go if you are not in the city and want a nice selection of beers with some appetizers. You're better off having food/dessert at one of many other places in the shops. Docked a star for weird dinner service."}
{"text":"Selection of beers are obviously in abundance and all credit goes to them for the we designed venue. The one caveat I have is the food, I was not impressed with the taste/quality. Certainly not a place I'd recommend to eat. But for a wide selection of drinks, you've made the right choice."}
{"text":"Beer is obviously the highlight, and the selecfion is the best in The West End.  Atmosphere is lively.  Service and staff need to improve on speed and manners."}
{"text":"Went to the King Street location for brunch yesterday with my partner, daughter and her boyfriend. Service and beer choices were exceptional! The food is terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Although it was great to sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful day, this is not a place I would return to again. Oh, and the live entertainment wasn't very good as well."}
{"text":"We LOVED the Esplanade Bier Markt! I found it by looking over travel sites before we left for our trip to Toronto and was so happy that we stopped here. We came in on a cold Tuesday afternoon and the place was pretty quiet. We just got a few beers before the Jays game, so I can't comment on the food, but the beer selection was awesome. I was really impressed with the amount of beers they had on tap and was happy to get to try some Canadian brews that are not available in my area. 

The bartenders were really nice (like everyone we met in Toronto) and it was fun talking to them while we hung out. 

I can't wait to come back here the next time I am in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Came here for the beer.  Great selection of beers and server was extremely knowledge about the beer.  She did accidentally hit my friend in the head but she took the time to recommend certain beers based on the flavour profile we requested so we still love her :)  As I was an amateur, our server even brought some samples for me to try.  Love the relaxed atmosphere.  Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I'd mention the food, staff or ambiance of the establishment but they were closed for a private event with no notice on their website, Facebook nor Twitter."}
{"text":"Went for a patio dinner with friends.  Arrived at 6pm to an empty inside and a 3/4 full patio.  Waited 20 mins to get our first drink order.  Then another 15 before those drinks came.  45 mins for our appetizer then 45 mins in between finishing our app and the waitress taking our order for dinner.

At one point there were no tables on the patio that had any sort of food on them.  

We ordered calamari to start (very tasty and cooked well)  between the four of us we ordered fish and chips (2 orders), big asd burger, chicken and goji on rice.   Everyone's dinner was was great!  Throughly enjoyed the food!

The amount of beer choices is amazing!  We tried 9 different beers at our table.  All of them were very tasty!

Overall the food and drinks were good!  Service sucked and prices were a bit high!"}
{"text":"30 minutes for my first drink to hit the table. Was told draft beer was broken, and only bottles were the option. Funnily enough I was watching draft beer being poured and delivered to other tables.One of us ordered two separate things for the meal and only only was delivered. Finished the terrible poutine and waited longer for the next dish to arrive. Also terrible (pretzels and fondue). One of us asked for vegetarian penne (hold the chicken) and was charged for extra vegetables. Took over 30 minutes for my bill to arrive after we asked three separate people for it. Manager never table touched. Zero concern or apologies for our experience. We had to flag the waitress down for any service at all. Why pay a premium price for lack luster service? Absolute terrible experience and will not return."}
{"text":"I can't figure this restaurant out. They do a lot of things right like provide an amazing array of artisanal (but pricey!) beers on draft and luxe cheeses in their fondue but much of that goes wasted on the douchey guys drinking Heineken in bottles and the skanky girls in skimpy outfits who're on air diets. Normally, I'm not too affected by the other diners at a restaurant but they're so egregiously obnoxious at Bier Markt, you can't help but notice them like the stench of feces in a crowded airplane cabin.

Our Yelp group came here for the excessively and unnecessarily umlauted Fond√ºe Feastiv√ºl[1]. Each portion of fondue ($17-19) was enough to fill a tea cup; sufficient for two people max, not 3-4 as we were told pre-event. They come in impressive cast iron pots which ought to keep the cheese warm but the fondue arrived cold and the teensy tea light candles they provided did little to raise their temperature.

The accompanying dipping ingredients did not do justice to the cheese mixture either; stale cubes of baguette, risotto cakes that tasted suspiciously fishy, ice-cold asparagus pieces so thin they looked like green ropes of licorice which kept slipping through the tines of the fondue fork. It was as disappointing as finding out on your honeymoon night that your partner is impotent and he forgot the Viagra.

To make matters worse, the service was spotty and pompous. Requests for water went ignored, our dessert fondue arrived before they cleared our cheese fondue. And when I politely asked one waitress if they could replace our cheese-riddled plates and forks so we could enjoy the final course, her response: \"Only if you say please.\" Huh? OK, PLEASE do your job properly and PLEASE drop the shitty attitude. Please and thank you.

As it turned out the chocolate fondue again arrived cold and the caramel fondue was so sweet I felt a toothache come on at first bite. Not worth their $15- and $16-price tags, especially considering the pitifully under-ripe winter strawberries they came with. (They also forgot to light our votives for the burners.)

Fondue is meant to be a cozy, communal meal that brings people together but with Bier Markt's weird dance-club vibe, unpleasantry of the staff, and clientele that's cheesier than the emmental and raclette fondue, I couldn't wait to bolt from the premises and take a shower to wipe off the layer of slime that had accum√ºlated on me. √úgh.

{"text":"The charcuterie board was pretty tasty, the steak was prepared very well (and tasty). Service was quick and easy. First trip to Montreal, and I will definitely be back for this place."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. 1hour and 45 minutes later we got our food...couldn't even enjoy it as we needed to get back to work, already super late. This is the second time this place let me down which is why I'm posting a review. Also when we got our food it was cold."}
{"text":"One of my go to places when out with friends. Good apps that go along well with the beer. Love that they have a lot of choices for beer it's always nice to try new ones. Prices are good and place has a nice vibe."}
{"text":"Excellent food choices, whether you want a full meal or just apps and drinks. Well-enough priced (coming from NYC where everything is super-over-priced). Great crowd, fun and lively knowledgable servers. Overall a winner."}
{"text":"Beer selection is second to none. They always have something exciting to choose from. Food is always a sure bet, but nothing too inspired. A great place to spend the afternoon on the patio or for dinner after a game. Service is always excellent."}
{"text":"When the King St. Bier Markt opened up, I thought it would be tough for them to one-up their currently established digs on the Esplanade, but they managed to quite well with a cool combination of atmosphere and beer. The downstairs vibe is much more pub-ish then the club feel of their other spot. The place gets just as packed come 10pm on a Friday, but doesn't feel as hectic and sweaty. The clientele is a bit more grown-up and tame, which makes for a more pleasant drinking experience. Also rad for a quick bite for lunch."}
{"text":"This is where I and my friends first got seriously into beer. They have a extensive menu of draft and bottled beers. The atmosphere is what led to us leaving the place for greener pastures. Getting a seat is near impossible after 7:30pm and the place is shoulder-to-shoulder packed by 9:30. Not a great place to enjoy a beer with friends, which is a shame because the menu is worth exploring. My recommended time to visit: lunch-time. The food is average. A fun place to be for New Years Eve, especially if you are able to score the back room. (will require a reservation for at least 12 people)"}
{"text":"The only saving grace was the beer selection. Poutine was cold, service horrible and there was a dead bug in my water. We went in during the lull between lunch and dinner. Despite it being just us and one other table, the service took ages and the server was just incredibly rude. When I pointed out the dead bug in my drink, the waitress didn't apologize and it seemed like it was the hardest thing of her life to replace my glass of water. Definitely not returning."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks! Like the beer selection. Excellent service too, at least when we went in the evening!"}
{"text":"Just finished a late dinner at Bier Market and absolutely not impressed. We weren't the first time as and that was a few months back but decided to give it a second chance as it's a short drive from our place.  Service was mediocre at best - no cutlery, napkins, plates - had to ask for everything. Per food -had chicken flatbread and the market burger. While the flatbread was decent, it was by far the driest burger I have ever had. It was like eating two pieces of thick cardboard in a bun. No more chances, we are done with Bier Market - Adios!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed but enough dings that it probably ended up a bit pricey for the overall meal.

What we had: Brie and cider fondue starter, Veal schnitzel, bacon and bier mussels, and a mushroom side. Plus a couple of nice dark beers.

The beer selection is great and there was nothing wrong with the meal as a whole that was a real turnoff. But the bread wasn't crusty. Many of the mussels were a bit small. The frites weren't super-hot and crispy. Nothing was bad but it just wasn't top flight. Maybe being a bit generous but we enjoyed."}
{"text":"From a wide variety of beers from all over the world to famous Central European cuisine , everything is tasty about this beautifully decorated restaurant ..."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very charming, had great knowledge of the food menu and beer, especially considering it was her second shift. Very impressive!

The menu is vibrant and simple, with a great list of vegetarian, seafood and meat options. Each menu item had a list of 3 beers to pairings - woohoo!

{"text":"I come here for the live band and live music. Crowd's very peaceful. Some creepers that spoils things as usual.."}
{"text":"Their burgers are over priced garbage, had the markt burger (17$) last nigt which was overcooked, unseasoned had no condiments,  my jaw was sore from chewing, it came without the cheese which I had asked for, the waitress commented that the cook was playing tricks on her, wow is this establishment for real? You clowns cant even make a burger? Simpliest thing on the menu,  What a joke! Also the sides are an additional cost which I think is ludicrous, sides should be part of the cost of the burger, anyway I got the green salad which was tiny and over dressed with sauce. Ended up only eating 2/3 of the burger cause i didnt want to waste my 17$ but had to throw in the towel, since i lost my appetite and couldn't chew, my jaw was so sore, the manager got wind of my crappy meal and offered to give me the 3$ salad for free, shouldve at least gave me one third the price off the burger, the standards here are abysmal, stick with the beer peeps! Not coming back :/"}
{"text":"I had brunch at Bier Markt on a Sunday afternoon during the long weekend. I've grown very tired of the brunch options at Yonge and Eglinton and consider Shops at Don Mills my first alternative location. My girlfriend had been raving about the Bier Markt brunch she had, so I thought I would give it a shot.

The place was very empty when we arrived at 2:30. The patio is nice and spacious. What really impressed me was the quality of the food. I've been to the Bier Markt on the Esplanade and never tried eating there. I didn't know what to expect. I had the Belgian Breakfast for $12. You get a large plate with fries, two slices of bacon, a sausage, beans, eggs and toast. At first I thought it was pretty small, but by the end I definitely felt like I got my money's worth. You'll definitely feel full if you have a beer with your meal (I had two). They have lighter beers, called radlers, that you can have so you won't feel like an alcoholic by drinking beer with a breakfast meal. 

The service was very friendly and attentive. They weren't busy so it's tough to give it a true rating.

As a brunch spot, the Bier Markt has won me over. Their prices aren't rock bottom, but you get what you pay for. There is nothing in my neighbourhood that has great beer offerings with quality food like the Bier Markt. 

I've only given it four stars because I haven't visited during dinner hours (and also because I was mercilessly attacked by a bee during my meal)."}
{"text":"The beer selection is great. Service is average. Food is not worth the prices. We ordered a flight of beers and sweet potato fries to start with. Beers were great, fries were fresh, but dips were flavor less. My husband ordered a Portobello burger which had no patty and was more like a snacking sandwich. The fries that came with it were soggy and mostly consisted of the end burnt pieces. I ordered the bbq chicken flatbread. All I tasted was the overly sweet mustard sauce and raw onions. Least they could have done is caramelize the onions. The chicken on it was totally bland. For the price they charge for food, not worth at all. I recommended going here for beer and a snack and finding another place for mains."}
{"text":"Headed down here on a Friday night. The overall atmosphere is awesome-there is a stage and live band playing cover songs! I liked the fact that there are places to sit where you can enjoy your food, but there is also an open area in front of the stage where you can dance.

I am not a big beer drinker, but anyone can tell you that the selection is extensive. We tried a strawberry flavoured beer named FRULI (made with real strawberries!), and would recommend it for all the ladies that aren't huge beer fans like me. Our waitress was very helpful, and really seemed to know her stuff. The beer prices are decent - 28 oz will cost you around $7

As for the food: ordered the poutine. It was good because there was meat in it, but the blue cheese I was not a big fan of. Also ordered a slice of chocolate cake-FANTASTIC!!! 

The only negative about the place: may be hard to find a space to sit for a large group of people, and it is very LOUD! Difficult to have a conversation with anyone not sitting or standing right next to you. 

The Bier Markt is definitely a great place to check out!"}
{"text":"This will be short and sweet: the food was fabulous, I was pleasantly surprised. My fish main course was just as good or even better that what you get at some of those fancy pricey restaurants. I would return!"}
{"text":"Extremely noisy, they were out of some of the beers we wanted, and the food was only passable - over-salted and over-priced. Not worth the trouble."}
{"text":"the beer selection is great, but the food mediocre, and overpriced. also, loud. nice service tho."}
{"text":"The food is good quality however you pay the price for it. The appetizers are very expensive and the main dish choice is not bad for supper. The beers are awesome though but again you pay the price for it. I was never impressed by service though. It is mediocre like the rest of canada (Toronto being the best I find) learn from the Americans guys ! Learn!!"}
{"text":"A week ago I met some friends at the pub. We ordered some beers and we shared an appetizer. The next day my girlfriend and I were vomiting and cramping. To the point I called Bier market and told them exactly what we ate and drank that night. The manager didn't even believe me and said the restaurant has high cleanliness standards. He's never heard of this. From now on I go to Beer Bistro on king st"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely not up to par for Montreal. Service is horrible. Been waiting 25 min already for our bill! Skip this place"}
{"text":"We just finished eating at the BierMarkt King Street location.  My husband had the Ahi Tuna ($27) which he enjoyed and I had Vienna Schnitzel ($24) which was absolutely horrible.  Panko crusted pork cutlet (simply a slab of dry breaded meat; no sauce - could have been shoe leather), Emmental & Gruy√®re cheese spaetzle (extremely greasy), baby arugula with Somersby Cider vinaigrette (really?? I think they forgot the vinaigrette).  One of the worst meals that I have had in a very long time.  The only redeeming feature was our server Jackie but even she didn't have enough sense to ask her manager to come over and talk with us when she saw that I ate hardly any of my food.  I will not be back and certainly won't recommend it to anyone.  Stay away."}
{"text":"I find that a good time to go to this place is for Lunch during the week or on Saturday. (Does not open until 4pm on Sunday) especially on a nice sunny day. They have a great appetizer consisting of various cold cuts of meats, cheese, bread etc. Good for sharing when one just wants a snack with one of the great varieties of draft or bottled beer."}
{"text":"Really good food and a bit of European fair. The owner is big on advertising German beer but the ads are a big fail for me as German. On weekends it gets pretty crowded and if you plan to have dinner there better come early.
As already said they offer a variety of good beer and some are even on tap. Heaven for beerdrinker who can not stand most of the Canadian or American beer. Their food is decent also more on the pricy end but especially their Oktoberfest special is pretty authentic and tasty. I would not recommend this place for a romantic dinner but in the summer its nice to sit outside on a not so busy road like King or Queen."}
{"text":"Ok - pre planned group of 47 arrived at 6:00pm - drinks flowed but appetizers didn't arrive until 7:45. Worlds smallest salad - consensus description. Duck legs - ok but bland. Water not replenished until 8:00 pm. It is now 8:23 and no sign of main course. Host requested bread or something to tide us over until food arrived - no luck. Drinks still flowing - although weak. 
Can see LeCage aux sports from third floor and guests ready to leave. Save your money and go to LeCage Aux Sports or anywhere else."}
{"text":"I would have given 3.5 stars if I could. This place and Bar Wellington get a lot of my business my default due to their patio and location across from my home. Had the wings and a side of fries to start. Wings were actually great and I would order them again. Lightly battered and great flavor. Chef carves the wings in such a way it makes them easy to eat. Fries were nondescript. Wife had the feature which was pork belly and scallops. This dish flopped as the scallops were fishy and the pork belly was very salty. I had the seared ahi tuna which was decent. Beers to match for both of us. Meal was $90 before tip but including taxes. Patio is great as long as you're ok with king west scene which is a combination of locals, the just got off work crowd and the obligatory invasion by 905ers - you can always pick them out. I'd go back here because of location and patio. Food was so-so but that isn't what this place is about."}
{"text":"If you are going for just drinks, then it's a great place to go. Even though they do get super jammed pack on the weekends. There's live music which is pretty great.

Last night, I went for dinner with 2 friends, and the service was terrible. Our waitress was busy with a table of 10-12, and she kept apologizing to us because of them. Her apologizing didn't even make the situation any better because we had to wait 10 minutes for water, 20 minutes for our beers then to place an order and 20-30 minutes for our meal which wasn't even that great. After that, the waitress said she was being cut off because she had been there since 11am and it was now 10pm. Though she kept working and helping other tables, and our 'new' waitress never came by to see how we were doing. 

I don't think I will be going back for their food! I was quite disappointed."}
{"text":"The bar area is so much fun. The staff are extremely friendly, knowledgable and fun. The food is great and they have specials most nights. The choice of beers is excellent, but you can also order wine or cocktails. An excellent restaurant and bar."}
{"text":"Looking for a beer dinner, you are perfect here. But also the food is excellent. The service is nice and quick and most important, well educated in the knowledge what beer fits to your meal or what beer could replace the Dessert....
I had a mixed starter to share, alone. It was quite good. All the other meals served arround me looked inviting....
More than 200 beers available, about 50 draught beers, lokals and around the world.... do I have to say more... as a German :-)"}
{"text":"We went to The Bier Markt on the esplanade with a small group of friends on the evening of December 15th. The bar staff were friendly and the live music was great. What really stood out and the reason for this review is for the security staff working this night. They dealt with a very difficult patron on the dance floor and with such restraint and understanding they were able to contain the situation while allowing everyone around to continue enjoying their night. This is the first time I have seen exemplary service from a security team at an establishment.

Thank you and keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection (although imported beers are not cheap): they had delirium tremmens and hoegaarden on tap. the service was not very fast but the bar was packed, which might explain the speed. The food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio at lunch for a solid hour with no food.  When it arrived, it was cold and just mediocre pub food.  If you have taste buds and you don't like waiting, go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Good location and excellent service. We were a bit in a hurry and our server made sure our plates came fast. She was very helpful. 
We ordered the schnitzel, the portbello goat cheese burger and a small pot of mussels which were excellent. Everything is a bit pricey, mainly because of the location."}
{"text":"Food 3.5/5 Decor 4/5 Ambiance 4/5 Staff&Service 3/5
First of all, I have to say I don't like beer, so if you are like me and think it's only a place to drink beer you are wrong. The cocktails are really great plus they have a full bar so they can make you whatever you wish. The food is good every time I've been, the last meal I had was the ahi tuna. It was perfectly seared and the potatoes and greens were delicious. I also had the bavarian pretzels which were also unexpectedly large with just the right amount of salt on them, and the hot-mustard sauce went very well with it too! However I have to say I'm on the fence for this review because I've visited BierMarkt three times now and the service has been hit or miss. I either got a cheery waitress that smiled and giggled at everything I said, or an irritated waitress that just answers 'I don't know' when you ask her a question about the menu and looks at you as if she expects you to simply choose something else instead of offering to check with the kitchen/bartender. But this might have just been a fluke."}
{"text":"Been here several times and enjoyed my experience each time. The wait staff were very attentive and friendly. I tried a few things on the menu, was decent but no wow factor. Nice ambiance, live bands, great beer, and love their oyster specials."}
{"text":"Good mussels, good fondue, good entertainment, good atmosphere. I give Bier Markt a thumbs up :)

PS: I do prefer the Esplanade location rather than the one on King St."}
{"text":"Beer selection is ok.. but service is not ok. Have to ask for the food menu several times and even though we  told them to be reay they never came for the order. Do yourself a favor.. go to WSVST service is gooood, beer selection very good and food delicious.. I am very glad TO is full of options..  beer markt"}
{"text":"So I  think i should clarify that because the bier markt serves both food and drink is the reason I am giving only 4 stars.  Had they only served alcohol it would have been 5 stars.  The service at this location was fine, and the food is average pub food ie. Burgers, flat bread etc.  The Beer selecrion is excellent.. the beer flight / wheel is a great concept and is good value in my opinion.  I thoroughly enjoy being able to sample such a wide variety of beer at a reasonable cost.  

If I was looking for my food to be the highlight if my experience, I would go somewhere else.  However if I am looking to have some good drink with friends in a lively atmosphere, then Bier Markt does the trick."}

{"text":"I love the weekends in the Bier Market. live shows, nice crowd... very good food and amazing selection of beers. I love going there with a group of friends or with my wife. highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ambiance and music is great. Location as well. Unfortunately, the food was somewhat lacking. The mussel pot with beer and bacon was bitter to the point of not being able to enjoy (or consume) the broth. And it was the only bacon dish I've ever had in a restaurant that did not taste like bacon. 
While admittedly being a beer douche, the beer list is impressive for length only, not content. It is filled with familiar names of national brands around the world, not quality, interesting beers.
Stop in for a pint after work, but don't make a dinner out of it."}
{"text":"I love this place.

The waitress was again very knowledgeable.  She said the restaurant has a very thorough training program, hence their knowledge.  +1 in my books.

But she also said she had to buy her owe lacoste shirt for work.  That's cheap as hell for a place of employment to make their workers purchase their own uniform.  Just saying.

Tried a few trappists and lambic beers.   Good stuff."}
{"text":"The service was seriously subpar. 

Our server was rude and no where to be seen when we needed her. The only exception was right after she took our drink orders and we saw her standing at the bar chatting while our beers were sitting on the counter. Another server had to run them for her and they came to the table without any head... I was expecting more from a speciality beer bar. 

We ordered some apps which were okay but decided not to stay for dinner because we were sitting with empty drinks for 15 minutes. 

I understand that it was busy, but that shouldn't compromise basic industry standards of service. I was really disappointed. 

Given that there's so many other places to go in the city for craft/specialty beer, you guys need to step it up."}
{"text":"We went here for a pre Christmas get together with some of my co-workers on a Friday night. The first moment you step in you can see all their beer kegs on tap and in bottles and there is also coat check too. Unfortunately there wasn't a long table to available all of us so they split us up in 2 booths. One downfall to this place is that you must have a minimum of 12 people to reserve a table. The service was very good and even the floor manager checked up on us to make sure we were okay. The food was really especially the frites, omg so good, and the mussels. I'm not much of a beer drinker but I loved their strawberry beer. They have a wide selection of beer which is whole book you can choose from. If that's your thing than this is your place to go. If you're not willing to pay so much on dining out than this place isn't for you. Our bill was over $100 for two people. I would recommend this place but I wouldn't come here too often as I would be in the poor house. I'll definitely go back for more frites and strawberry beer. Yum"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Well... My friends and I waited for 20 minutes before we had to go back to the hostess stand to ask if we actually had a server to which she responded \"yeah (insert servers name here) is your server, did you want me to get her for you.\" 
\"That would be great\" 
Eventually we ordered our drinks, a few friends ordered food. Our empty glasses and dirty plates sat on our table all night. We decided to endure the 7 minute wait at the (very quiet) bar to get refills on our drinks because it was better than waiting on our server. My friend and I actually left our table, went to joeys next door, ordered a drink and sat at their beautiful bar- while our friends waited for the server to return to our table. The tables that surrounded us in the bar area were filthy with empty glasses and dirty plates an hour after the guests left the establishment. 
I strongly believe the finger of blame should not be pointed at the server (which is why I didn't mention her name, or the manager (who looked overwhelmed and didn't appear to be very helpful with the pile of glassware at the bar, or surrounding filthy tables) 
I believe this is a head office issue. I would suggest hiring a training team to assist with your employees and helping them understand the steps of service. I am not one to publicly review a restaurant online- but I was left with no choice as their is no email address on their website or even a place to make a complaint."}
{"text":"I'd have to say...you should probably avoid the food and just come here for drinks. 
My friends had drinks, but I just wanted to have something to eat so my rating is solely on the apps we had!
The cheese fondue was downright SAD.  Consensus was that it tasted like melted processed cheese.  The bread it came with was stale.  The potato rosti was good but it only came with a few pieces.  
The burger sliders were good, and I enjoyed the chicken wings though not worth what we paid for them!  The flatiron steak cones were not to my liking - strange sauces and hardly any meat but tons of stranger vegetables..pickled vegetables..."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks for a night out.  The live band = always a good time. I've noticed the past few times this place seems to be popular spot amongst those on bachelor/bachelorette party. 

One of my favourite dishes if you don't feel like being a carnivore - the thai mussels and the rosemary bread that goes with it is just divine! Also, the caesar salad is surprisingly really good.. they make the dressing in house.. not too heavy nor too light."}
{"text":"Our server, Judy, knew the beer menu and gave great advice. The rest of the staff helped throughout the meal, bringing water and clearing plates. The food was great and the desert was better!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the Bier Market. 
It is primarily a restaurant but transitions into a bar for the evening crowd. 
The restaurant is rather large and there can be some negatives associated with that when it gets busy (slow service, rushed kitchen etc.) but my experiences have all been generally positive with dining there in groups of 4-10. 

Evenings on the weekend will almost always have a line so I wouldn't show up too late. 
Great beer selection, which should not be a huge surprise. Average to high beer prices but a decent trade off for the atmosphere. They will often have live music
Good for groups."}
{"text":"I love the smoked meat poutine, i'd walk across broken glass for a bowl of it. Staff here is friendly and the bartenders are quick and professional. Great live music and a young but mature crowd ensure you're gonna have a good night with friends and meet some new ones."}
{"text":"Do you really enjoy beer? Go here. Do you really enjoy hip, crowded party scenes? Go here. Do you enjoy beer but hate crowds? Don't go here on the weekend. (My rating of the place really jumps from a 3 - 4 depending what I am there for, but I do always find myself going back.)


Bier Markt is so not a hidden gem. Everyone in Toronto plus their cousin and grandpa has probably been to, or at least heard of, Bier Markt. With good reason too - BM has a great selection of beer, cute bartenders, nice patio seating in the summer, and a really happening weekend scene. I'm personally not too big a fan of their food items. Their menu is not too extensive and pretty pricey.

So you will always find me here with just my giant glass of Hoegaarden. And as I am slowly becoming more and more averse to crowds, you'll probably only find me here early in the evening until the place becomes pretty filled with sweaty, drunken bodies and the air becomes a little too moist to breathe. 

Atmosphere - 5/5
Service - 4/5
Food - 2/5
Price - 3/5"}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant for my birthday with my family. We were seated fairly quickly but then waited nearly 20 minutes until anyone followed up to ask us for drinks. Drinks came much later and it was much later before we were able to order food, deserts, bill etc. You get the point on service. It was just a painful night and pretty much ruined my birthday celebration. Food was fine but almost beside the point. I wont be going back, and i love beer, which says a lot of my evening."}
{"text":"Finally! Choices at Shops on Don Mills.  

Before Bier Markt finally opened up in this modern plaza, Joey's was the only place to go to in this area.  There's nothing wrong with Joey's but it's not as laid back as Bier.

I haven't tried dining here yet so I can't really comment on the food besides the poutine that I have ordered by the bar; which was solid.  However, the dining area does look very presentable but the music might be a little loud if rock music and dinner is not your thing.

The atmosphere is generally pretty good.  The music are usually pretty good and the bartenders are very helpful and friendly.  However, what I don't really understand is why they would put so many long tables in the bar area that takes up so much standing room and minimizing the dance floor.  

I usually advise people to get there early but it's hard to tell with this location.  Sometimes it's super busy but sometimes you can just walk in and grab a seat by the bar so it's more of a gamble.  Either way, do try to grab a seat by the bar or else you will find yourself stranded trying to order your drink.  The bar will be packed!

Tip: they have a small drink menu that list their samplers.  Try those.  It's a pretty good bargain for a variety of beer with a decent amount.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Bier Markt... 
A smiley waitress dressed in Lacoste will assist you to get a table. Once you are seat you will get the beer menu and the food menu, the idea? beers match the food. 
The food is a bit pricey, I tried the Thuna burger... it is really good. 

The beer? the belgium and german are well represented, also you can expect at least a beer per country... and thats were I start to disagree: some countries only have an average beer... sold at full price... 
Also the decor/ambiance is not coherent; they advertise themselves as  European-style, as a european I am still looking for it...
If you wanna get a spot on a padeo and Bar Hop is full this is a good alternative..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday. Had the chicken soup, sliders and one of the charcuterie boards. The service was unbelievably slow. After taking our plates, we waited for over half an hour for the server to return. The food was overpriced and average. By average, I mean below average. It was like 16 bucks for a couple of slices of salami."}
{"text":"Overpriced.
Bad service.
Staff steal items that are left behind - even if you call within 20 minutes for a missing sweater, they claim it never existed.

Don't waste your time and money going here."}
{"text":"Was seated on the patio and 15 minutes later no one came to serve us. Got up and left. Manager apologized and offered for us to stay but damage was done so we left. Maybe next time we will try it again"}
{"text":"Here are the facts from my dining experience here.

- Made reservations for 9pm, the hostess wrote it down for 7:30.  When we got there, she ended up seating 3 people who came in after us before we got a table.
- Ordered a braised rib poutine.  It only had two pieces of meat, a ton of gravy and 11 french fries.  Ordered another side of fries (which rang up the total cost of my appetizer to $12) and the fries were cold.
- Food came with no utensils.  the place wasn't even busy and we had to wait 10 minutes before another waitress came around.
- A friend ordered a glass of wine.  After taking a few sips, found the wine glass was cracked.  Never seen that happen.  The waitress just poured the wine into another glass when I would have hoped she woudl have poured a full glass for our troubles.

So, all this and considering what we spent on the meal, had to have been the worst and most overpriced dining experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"Relatively good selection of beer but food was seriously disappointing. Service wasn't very impressive too. 
There are better places where I can spend my money."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food and the service.    The food was not worth the price.  $17.00 for 8 chicken wings!  The service was slow and distracted.   Waited a long time for the food.    The Keg service and food is hands down much better."}
{"text":"I used to come here a couple of times a week food used to be amazing, today I returned after being away for a few months to enjoy the patio and some great eats. The food was ok but didn't leave me with the usual sensation of great. The service was slow, a little uncaring, and unavailable. It took way to long for a refill on drinks."}
{"text":"Location: King and Portland, convenient location with lots of cabs that go by. 

Facility: Typical bar/lounge atmosphere indoors. A/C is on, kind of chilly but as people funnel in and alcohol starts going, it's not so bad. Hooks are available under the bar to hang purses. The band was incredible doing great cover songs of indie rock that's popular at the moment. Washrooms could use a little work, halfway through the night, it looks like a disaster. Patio space is available, it's nice a quiet outside, but you can't hear any of the great music there. 

Food Quality & Price: Food was average, not why you'd go to Bier Markt. The oysters were also so-so. Some were not shucked very well and ended up having some sand/shell in it. At $3 a piece, I don't think I'd get oysters again there. Beer menu is impressive. I am not a heavy beer drinker so I opted for a fruity and light. Beer flights are a great way to \"sample\" beers. I like the following 

- Fruili
- Rosada Rose
- Steigl Grapefruit Radler
- Somersby Cider

Beer cocktails are also another \"sweet\" option. (Ya do not follow my list if you prefer hoppy/bitter tastes. I like mine light, sweet and refreshing.)

- Orange beersicle
- Belgian beerlini

Service: Average. Can't say any of the staff went above and beyond. However, one of our friends was hesitant to try a beer. The waitress encouraged her to try and if she didn't like it, they'd give her another. She went for it, didn't like it (but didn't want another beer) so they took it off her bill. Service on the patio was much more attentive. Bar service was smoothly run (but nothing above an beyond).

Overall: Good place to hang out with friends. Music is good, but very loud indoors. Hard to chat. If you want to socialize, patio maybe the better option, but it's pretty tame out there and you can't hear any music. Would likely return if my friends return, probably wouldn't be the one to ask to go there."}
{"text":"Anyone that gives this place five stars really needs to get out more.

Where the Bier Market on King is a \"little\" classier, this beer garden turned nightclub is really nothing special. Especially when it is serving as the latter.

Bonus star for the nice patio, and the massive selection of fun beers. I've never had a meal here that was particularly interesting, and it is often filled with rowdy sports fans that use the green P across the road to park at when visiting the ACC. 

Minus a star for the fact that the entire place SMELLS like old beer.

For Beer tastings on a nice patio, its a great choice. Especially if you have non-Torontonians visiting and they want an apricot flavored beer after trekking through the St.Lawrence market or something like that. You likely need the server to help you find something you will like unless you are WELL versed in Beer. I was disappointed in the \"thick-heavy-dark-beer\" selections that I sampled.

Avoid at all costs any Friday/Saturday night or any time there is a sporting event unless you like nightclubs, leaf fans or any combination of the two because then you'll feel right at home.

**Edit: I counted my Plus and Minus Stars incorrectly. Two Stars. **"}
{"text":"The selections of beer are great....

However, the food were alright...
We ordered the short ribs but it was kind of tasteless, maybe its the style?
The other meal we ordered was the mussels. It came with fries, but 1/3 was long fries, and the other 2/3 was short and I called it the \"tiny bit\" fires.

The service was great but food was so so."}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed my experience here.  Great ambiance and the service was excellent.  

The beer selection is impressive to say the least. For dinner I had the beer can chicken and The Brine special.  I enjoyed the dinner.  The soup was probably the best soup I've ever had.  

It's a bit on the pricey side, but I will definitely return, and likely with a corporate group too."}
{"text":"THE GOOD:
Food is sooo good here.  We were there for dinner and stayed till about 11:30 at night.  Around 7 the line started and by the time we left, the music was blaring, there was live music and the place was packed.  It's  been a while since I've been to such a busy, hip and lively place with lots of atmosphere and no pretension.  Loved it and would return here just to hear the music.  Would definately have dinner here to avoid the lineups to get in.  FYI, had the scallops appetizer, 12oz steak with rapini and chocolate cake.  Took 1/2 the steak home cause there was so much food and was stuffed to the gills.  Highly recommend.  

THE SO-SO: 
Sometimes it was so loud from the music and crowd that it was hard to carry on a conversation.  

THE BAD:
Price
Lineups if you're past 7pm"}
{"text":"I've been here once and I found the whole experience obnoxious. Not sure why, but the women servers are required to wear sausage dresses while the male servers can dress in casual wear. My friends and I (male and female) found this super sexist.

Also, it's winter... there's no patio anymore... yet this restaurant feels the need to blast music outside. I work in a nearby building and it's very annoying. I'm astounded the restaurant can get away with this. I will be lodging a complaint with our building manager."}
{"text":"very poor customer service. Came in on Monday September 18th around 9pm. Was seated and given the menu right away, but we were never approached again after that. Waited for about 20 minutes and we were ignored by all the waiters and we ended up walking out. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Very disappointed at new location. Came a second time, both times it took more than 3 hostesses to seat us. Etobicoke was very friendly, here just okay. Lots of empty tables both times, both times told they were reserved, no one ever sat at them. Overall very disappointed."}
{"text":"A restaurant that turns into a bar later in the evening.

Bier Markt is a new, clean ornate and sterile place.  This space reminds me of the giant brew pubs you run into in the suburbs of Americana, except this one isn't surrounded by a huge parking lot just down the divided highway from the mall.

Bier Markt does have a terrific selection of biers/beers from around the globe on tap, really good Belgiums, Germans, Framboise's, they even have Brooklyn (hoe!) Lager.

The crowd at Bier Market is well dressed and good looking upper 20s into 30s.  We weren't there for very long, but this place seemed like a pick-up bar.  Our expedition did find that a breed similar to the American Cougar can indeed be found as far North as Toronto.  Apparently, this species is more versatile than originally believed.  Attempts to control the spread of this dangerous predator have not been successful.  Beware or happy hunting!

Although, more pretentious and with more attitude than other places we visited, patrons of Bier Markt were still friendly.  There wasn't a cover when we got there, but when we left an hour later there was a line 40 deep waiting to get in.

Live entertainment at Bier Markt at 9:00 on a Saturday consisted of a cover band.  Prior to their set, the deejay was killing me spinning a set of 90s Top 40 that included that SWV song that sampled Michael Jackson's Human Nature and that cherry cherry cola song by Savage Garden.  I'd never been so happy to see a cover band take the stage just to get that deejay away from his laptop.

The mega-bar isn't really my type of place, but given how club-centric downtown Toronto is, this place wasn't that bad for the older crowd.  At least they've got lots of tasty beer."}
{"text":"Beer was good but the food was cold. I'm not one to complain but cold food is turn off. They re made both plates which I appreciate, but my husband finished eating his before mine showed up. Annoying. With so many great places in Montreal, we will not be going back"}
{"text":"Let's just say not my favourite place. We went here for some drinks and an app while waiting for a table next door for dinner. This place is soooooooo loudddddd. Holy crap!!! We ordered drinks, the pork shanks and the charcuterie platter. Unfortunately what we didn't get was plates or cutlery. Even after we asked for them she only brought napkins and plates so eating with our hands was the only option. They had a live band that started, which was pretty good but only made it harder to speak to one another. I was sitting 2 feet from my friend across the table and was shouting at the top of my lungs to try and communicate with her. The charcuterie was just ok, the meat was good but a little warm which is off putting. Overall the $81 bill for the drinks and two apps was not worth it at all. The waitress was a ditz and mixed up our receipts with another tables after we had already paid - which made me nervous I paid twice. I definitely wouldn't go back."}

{"text":"My cousin and I were at Bier Markt on Thursday August 4 2017. The time we were there was between 10-11:45pm. When we walked in no one acknowledged us. We were waiting for a table for the past 2-4 minutes. The bartender was simply talking to another hostess. who was either finished their shift, taking a break and also drinking a beer! WE WERE SO SHOCKED!!!, another hostess just walked right passed us as if we were ghost (SHOCKED)!!.  THERE WAS NOT ONE IN THE RESTAURANT! SO WE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY WE WERE WAITING. AFTER 4 mins the bartender looked up and offered us a table in a lounge. He brought around the menu. When we ordered drinks we asked to see what the champagne bottle looks like (200ml) the bottle was never brought to our table. After our appetizers we had to ask for water. (USUALLY WATER IS THE FIRST ITEM BROUGH TO ANY TABLE, REGARDLESS IF THE CUSTOMER ASKED FOR IT OR NOT). Afterwards he took 10 minutes to bring our bill. WE ALSO WANTED FRIES BUT WE WERE NEVER TOLD ABOUT LASTCALL TO ORDER FOOD OR DRINKS. I was very appalled by the service received by the team at Bier Market. All we wanted was a good meal and some oysters, but regardless of what time it is, service should not be lowered simply because its closing time"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch.  Had an excellent burger with fries.  Now...normally I am a pescatarian (vegetarian that eats fish) but on occasion I feel that need to eat burger.  This was one of those days.  The burger (to me) was great.  Medium, juicy etc. etc. are outside and that was good.  Service was good considering the place was packed.  What else is there to say, aye?"}
{"text":"Best Beer Selection in the City

Wow! 

Fancinating and extensive menu. I had an ESB and my fiancee ordered a Frulli 

Food though.. just tried the Market Poutine it was oversalted and over gravied. Need to specify next time to hold the salt and be light on the gravy but other than that the beer selection rocks!

Cool place to hang, had a DJ spinning retro tunes on Wednesday night."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Better than average pub due to the sheer number of beers they have available. 

Trappist beers is where it's at. 

The food is pricey and generally I don't go to Bier Markt to eat. 

We did order a poutine here ($9) to go along with the beers and I must say it is distinctly better than what I've had at the other Bier Markt locations (King St and Esplanade).   I specially requested the fries have no salt and the gravy be served on the side. It was close to perfect. The fries were fresh and the gravy was made in house.

The layout is different than the other locations with an emphasis on dining in, half the restaurant is occupied by tables. The other half is the bar. At the bar area there's a little stage tucked in a corner where the DJ / live band can play."}
{"text":"almost a year later. re-reviewing this place. 

i was here on a friday night, had to standing in line for about an hour. Apparantly we didn't  here early enough because the place reached capacity at 9:45pm according to security. this is in the fricken winter, I'm surprised it was so packed.

no doubt it's a popular place in the city. in the summer time it's packed. mainly because it has a lot of beer selections and most importantly NO COVER.

my first time trying a Trappist beer, it's different and taste and smells a lot better than any other stuff I've had before. Kind of spoils you and I don't want anything else after that. 

Band was rockin it out that night.. they were good.

Friend had an incident with a douche on the dance floor, people suddenly become so bold with alcohol. Anyway didn't have to knock him into reality. 

Anyways besides that incident everything was alright.  The beer selection and lively band will keep me coming back if I'm in the mood."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once, only because I didn't enjoy my burger and fries the first time, but decided to give it another shot a year later... Still wasn't impressed... I ordered the sliders which were actually decent.... Also got the \"poutine tour\", which I felt it was so unnecessary the way they do it... It's basically three of the same poutine with just a different toping, one with brisket, one plain, and one with candied bacon, which was ruined with sour cream put all over the top (such a weird flavour mix!).  I got the BBQ chicken flatbread which was just weird... They had a jam on there with some mustard (forget what exactly), huge chunks of onion annnnd yeah... Just an unpleasant mix for myself... The people I were with got the muscles, which they enjoyed, just a lot of them were empty, but they brought extra for them when they mentioned it which was nice.... All in all I won't be back unless it's just for drinks."}
{"text":"This restaurant might be one the worst ones that I have dined in a long time.  Many crimes were committed... let's see, where do I start...

Service:  For every dish that came out, they took a whole minute to explain what was inside.  It's fine, except I already read the menu (heck that's where I ordered it from), so I really did not need to be reminded of what I had just ordered.  Also the luke warm plate was nice getting cold.  You could tell the staff was forced to do this.  Are 18 adjectives on what a beer taste like going to really help me?  What the hell is a fruity note?  Fruits smell different from one another.  I love beer.. just tell me if it is a lager, a dark beer, somewhere in between, etc..

Food:  Extremely bland. Reheated food, that was not reheated properly. Every single dish require a heavy hand from the salt shaker, which by the way, we had ask for ironically.   The mini sliders were some of the crappiest burgers that I have had.  Even McDonalds has more flavour.

Value:  LOL a joke really.  Yes, the beer selection is very impressive.  But some go for $15 for a 330mL bottle.  Was it imported?  Yes, probably was.  But are other beers... $15 for a bottle of beer is kind of silly.  But then again, I don't drink $100/bottle wines either, so your opinion on this part might differ.  I stand firm on the food value though.. crappy."}
{"text":"went to see this new place since it looked busy. After getting inside, sat at the bar. It took 20 min before someone actually looked my way. I was charged $9 for 12oz of a Belgian beer, that tasted exactly like Molson Canadian. The menu looked really impractical and expensive.  
The people that seemed to populate this place were typically parties of women in their 20s and a few guys, who probably think a place is high class just because it spells beer, \"bier\", and has some nice decor. Other than an image, this place is a waste of time and money. Rather than the decor and yuppie image, they should have better service and some real food on the menu at normal prices."}
{"text":"First spot we hit up in Montreal.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful being that we weren't from Canada.  Service was good.  We had appetizers and drinks.   Poutine tour was very good."}
{"text":"Great place if you're looking for a vast selection of beers because they have many beers on taps and lots of bottle selections from around the world at reasonable prices. It's not called the Bier Market for nothing.

The food has been a hit or miss over the years and I find the price I'm paying, the quality and portions are not equal to the pricing on the menu.

Service is usually friendly, but when it gets busy the staff sometimes falls behind on service quality and you'll be wondering where they went.

This is a good place to socialize, but can get quite noisy especially on weekends when there's a live band performing, plus the music being played can sometimes be too loud making conversations difficult.

What I like most about this location is probably the patio as it gets quite a lot of sun during the day and it's always a great spot for people watching.  Not quite busy like on Queen Street, but still some interesting characters walking by on King Street."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection, but crappy food. I came here with a group of co-workers and everyone thought their meal was mediocre, at best. It was disappointing to see such a poor selection of vegetarian options. Sorry, but a salad just doesn't cut it for me."}
{"text":"We went here on Wednesday night for a birthday party. Our waitress was amazing ! Food was so good. Everyone was really happy"}
{"text":"One of the posters mentioned consistent and that has been my experience as well. Food is great and beers even greater. Clean bathrooms and friendly, knowledgeable waitstaff. No resos for the patio so arrive early to avoid disappointment. Vegetarian options eg potato pizza available. Pizzas wings n fries are good. Calamari is too small."}
{"text":"This location has bad service. No planning or organization what so ever. Other locations in GTA are better.  Went on  Saturday night was put on a wait list for 30-45 minutes for a seat. There were clearly seats available instead they chose to create a line up out the door. 

Other than that beer and food are great."}
{"text":"I'm picky about food and I won't try this place again. 

I've eaten here twice. Train wreck both times. They tried to make amends with a gift certificate and they screwed that up too. 

That not the worst part.  It's the beer selection!! It's not good for my palette. I like English and Irish beers they have almost nothing... I think I had Alexander Keith's as I couldn't get anything better. For as many different types as they have it's pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"service is ok but a bit expensive there machine was down I couldn't use my Visa card  they want me to use the ATM to withdraw money 
Which cost more money iwasent too happy with it I want go back again"}
{"text":"- tons of beer selection, really a treat
- food was very good... Very high class pub, balanced menu
- band was really good. Rock / jazz fusion 
- decor is modern and sexy

recommend"}
{"text":"If you didn't know beer before, you will after a visit here. The staff are very knowledgeable so do not hesitate to ask about their extensive drink options and find that perfect pairing for your meal or taste preference. I had the pleasure of trying out a delightful peach cider, but even that could not hold a candle to the schnitzel. You must order schnitzel when you're here, it'll be served to you with amazing fingerlings and a bit of macaroni salad - it will leave you feeling hearty indeed!"}
{"text":"For anyone who appreciates good beer, this place is a must-visit. I've been here several times over the last couple of years, and I've almost always had a good experience.  

Yes, the beers here are expensive. But it's their attention to detail that makes it worth it. The beer is always served in a glass from the brewery, with a matching coaster. It is never flat.  For all of that, I'd say a dollar more per drink is a steal. For those who want to try a new beer, but haven't heard of a particular brew, there is a helpful booklet that describes each of the beers. 

I have brought several friends, and everybody left impressed by the place and the general ambiance. The dress code during the day is casual and dressy casual at night.  For those who are wondering, this is a bar, not a pub, so try not to walk in with trainers and workout socks!

I'm not a big fan of their food, apart from the poutine, which is great. But I come here for the beers, not the food. 

In case you haven't figured out by now, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Celebrated New Years Eve here and the place was crowded. The live band sung until midnight and after midnight club music was played which attracted people to dance on the little dance floor in front of the stage. I didn't get to eat here since we already ate upon arrival but I am definitely coming back to try the food and will update my review accordingly. However, I wanted to mention we were lucky we had reservations, as I called two days ahead to inquire about reservations for New year's eve as many restaurants don't make reservations for that night. The hostess told me yes so I called back to confirm the number of seats for reservations and was told that they were not taking reservations that night, however as to my call prior they allowed me to reserve. On the day of New Years Eve, I received a call from the supervisor/manager named Gabriella regarding the reservations, as they weren't supposed to be made for that night but since it was their fault and to be courteous we were still reserved. As this was kind of unprofessional on their part however it was still courteous for the supervisor to keep our reservations as I would hate going there as a group of 10 and having to stand the entire night. Over all it was a good experience, we also received complimentary champagne to toast when the clock ticked 12."}
{"text":"Had the duck wings (drumlettes) which were amazing. Goose Island is prominently featured but there are other brews as well. The place had been renovated inside and was closed for quite a while. What's old is now new. Service was only so so, otherwise a good time."}
{"text":"Apparently they don't want my business. Hostess claimed 30 minute wait despite many empty tables and no people that looked like they were being seated. Found room at the bar and were totally ignored by the bar staff for at least 15 minutes before we decided to bail and go to a better beer bar (c'est what)! Pretty sure I will never bother wasting my time at Bier Markt again! Unless I'm in Cleveland, Mcnultys Bier Markt Cleveland is the bomb!"}
{"text":"With the craft beer scene in Ontario changing and evolving so rapidly it's nice to see an establishment that refuses to evolve with the times. Features on their menu are the same tired choices that were available when the wall fell in Berlin. 

Hungry and looking for a snack, the potato and bacon pizza was an interesting choice. Our judgement was clearly clouded and we lacked the caloric stores to send it back.

If you're into clean eating, we highly recommend the potato pizza, while high in carbs, very low in sodium. 

On the plus side.. Service was great! Our server gets an eBay style A++! 

The Bier Markt, a great night out if fasting isn't an option."}
{"text":"Amazing place to go with friends or visitors from out of town. The variety of beers available is insane! They actually have a menu that splits up the different beers from the countries they came from. Beers on tap are unmatched in the city. If you looking to add some variety to your beer consumption, come here and try something new! Thursdays they have live bands which makes for an awesome setting. The food here is pretty good considering its a bar setting. Patios in the summer are always packed and an amazing social experience. Every time I go here I try a new beer. Good luck finishing the entire menu...but that's a challenge in of itself that I may take on! Any takers?;) Cheers and enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here to celebrate our anniversary.

I'll start by saying if what you are looking for is a nice, quiet, quaint, intimate atmosphere...walk right past their door - you won't find that here.
It's very club/pub loud.  The \"pub\" section and \"restaurant\" section are separated.

We were entirely overwhelmed by the beer menu (100+ varieties) so we asked out waitress for a suggestion, she was great, let us know some of the favourites, her favourite, and what was suggested to pair with the meals we ordered.  We also had a Radler sampler - it was pretty good, very unique!

We ate the oysters (delicious!) cheese fondue, Ghant ribs and a 1/2 kilo muscles (a la snob)
Everything was incredibly delicious!
we had the flour-less chocolate cake for dessert,  also really good!

Our waitress was great!  One of the other ones in the section was a little lacksidaisy \"not give a crap\" but she wasn't serving us so I won't hold it against anyone...her and the guy at the table next to us could use a course in social filters though!

We would definitely go back!  Aside from being really loud, the atmosphere was nice!  Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"Overall Bier Markt has pretty good service and the food is enjoyable, but the Etobicoke location at Sherway Gardens was a real let down for service and food quality. 

First off, the restaurant wasn't very busy when we were seated, but it took about 15 mins for my friend and I to get our drinks ordered and the menus to arrive. 

When our food came out another 20 mins later, I wasn't given what I had ordered. I ordered the ahi tuna burger, but whatever I was brought was definitely not any sort of fish. I am positive I was given a pork burger of some sort with the center still uncooked. When I asked our server if this was how the ahi tuna burger was suppose to look and taste, she did check with the chef and he insisted that the burger was fine. Anyone who's ever eaten seafood knows that the meat is flaky and not ground up so I ended up simply eating the bread and toppings only. 

My friend's chicken sandwich was better, but nothing special. The only positive thing about the meal was the crispy onion rings. 

I would definitely recommend avoiding this location if you can."}
{"text":"Had a beer sampler there called Sweet and Sour with a selection of six beers. For a not beer drinker I rather enjoyed the little sampler and walked away with a few I plan to try later again. 

For food we had something called a chucuterie a word which I probably butchered. The is an assortment of bread, spreads and your selection of meats. After that we had a cheese fondue which came with granny Smith apples, bread and pickled vegetables. 

The service was good and our waitress attentive. Things did slow down as the world cup gsme started but that was no issue we had our beer and our food. The only time we ever waited was for the bill and that was because they were bringing a slice of cake for my belated birthday. 

Conclusion is I would defiantly go again."}
{"text":"I agree with the average rating. They have a good selection of bier and Gouda bombs are tasty too.
However, the service was crappy. Slow as hell. Nobody to seat us, nobody to serve us and the waitress hardly stopped by even after the food was served... Let's not go into how long it took to get our check"}
{"text":"A great restaurant for business travelers and tourists alike!

Was in Toronto on business, and was referred to this place by my local colleagues.  It was packed...on the outside.  We almost turned around when we saw the patio, but we were starving, so we figured at least we could get an appetizer while we waited at the bar.  

We walked inside and....crickets.  Not a table was taken.  But there was an hour wait for a patio table!  Then we were informed that this week was the first week of decent weather in Toronto, so patio seating was at a premium.  We ate inside.

Being the Yank that I am, I went with the kilo of mussels.  My metric conversion was a bit rusty, and I my ignorance was rewarded with 2.2 pounds of mussels....holy crap they were delicious.  I got them \"a la snob\" style (lobster cream) and kinda wished I had just gone with traditional lemon, white wine, and garlic broth.  The lobster \"cream\" was lacking overall flavor, and was more of a broth than a cream sauce, but still, the mussels were fresh and plump and juicy, and the broth was great for sopping up with a little piece of bread.  We also got an order of Poutin (Fries, covered with Quebec cheese curds and gravy), traditional Canadian fare, we were told.  The gravy was delicious, accented the cheese curds perfectly.

A little pricey if you can't throw down the Corporate card, but still a very tasty meal."}
{"text":"Went to try out the new Bier Markt that opened on Queensway (Etobicoke).  I've been to the location downtown on the Esplanade and always had a good experience there.  Their delicious food, abundance of beers and the overall lively atmosphere makes it a popular hot spot in Toronto.

 I started with Fruli - strawberry beer from belgium. YUM!
Because it was dim in there - I didn't want to use flash on my photos - sorry if you can't really see!

The Roasted Beet Salad with strip-loin has red & gold roasted beets, mache lettuce, roasted almonds, crumbled goat cheese, crimson grapes, honey ale and mustard vinaigrette.  I was never a fan of beets but this salad totally changed my mind on them - I love them!  The different flavours and textures was extremely tasty and I would definitely go back for this.  With the salads, you're able to choose from striploin, salmon or chicken fyi.

 The Atlantic Salmon was a good sized grilled fillet sitting on top of bok choy, wilted spinach, grape tomato pistou and crispy quinoa cakes.  It was really a great combination of ingredients and the salmon melted in your mouth.  One of the best I've tasted.

I really want to go back to try the other dishes... Perhaps their Flammekeuches (flatbread) and Oyster Towers next time!"}
{"text":"Great place to socialize and drink!

The Bier Market is a great spot to socialize with your friends over drinks. The Bier Market has a bar and restaurant vibe to it as patrons can choose to sit at the table section and order food or stand at one of the many bar rails set up around the restaurant and order drinks. 

The main attraction of this joint is their great selection of international beer. Each time you come to this bar it can be a new drinking experience as you can try out a new beer from practically every country around the world. 

As an added bonus, the Bier Market occasionally has live bands for entertainment. 

The only drawback to this place is that the menu of drinks is pricey and your bill can add up pretty quickly. In terms of how the food taste, it is just OK and pretty expensive I might add.

I also have to mention that the place does get crowded, especially on weekends. 

Overall, it's more of a spot to hang out with friends and drink, not necessarily the best spot to eat."}
{"text":"A 3-Star A-OK almost feels like a stretch for me, but there was nothing so offensively bad as to make it a two-star experience, but they really failed to impress last time.

I went with a girlfriend for dinner. I wasn't feeling well so decided to skip the beers, which was heartbreaking. I ordered a coke, and although I find a little glass bottle adorable, less than a can's worth of coke for 2.75 is a lot, and with the saltiness of our meal, I had to order two. I knew I wouldn't be getting a free refill, but it was still a bit annoying. 

My friend and I decided to split the cheese fondue and then the smoked meat flat bread. Well we thought they would be paced, but instead everything came out to our tiny little two-top at once, where we had to remove side plates, water glasses, everything to make room for all the food at once. It was inconvenient, I couldn't reach the potatoes that came with the fondue and my friend  couldn't reach the apple slices. 

The fondue itself was pretty yummy, but the dipping items were disappointing. The bread tasted fine once dipped, but it was pretty mediocre. The apple slices tasted more like lemon than anything else, even after being dipped. Clearly they had been squirted to stop them from browning, but the kitchen effectively eliminated any apple flavour. The potato pieces that came with were cold - even after a lengthy dip in the hot cheese they were still cold. YUCK.

The flatbread was totally cold too by the time we got to it, and meh in flavour. 

all in all, go to Bier Markt to drink, not to eat."}
{"text":"Really great food. Nice patio. Phenomenal selection of beer. 
Was a little, tiny bit pricey, but still very good. I had the steak burger. Not just ground beef, but more like: chopped chunks of steak. Truly magnificent.  Second best burger I've ever had.  (See Dad's Kitchen in Sacramento, CA) 
Otherwise, the staff was polite and accommodating. 
Very good and highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is definately the worst Bier Markt I ever been too and I been to them all.  We had to wait 20minutes for our waiter to arrive, then another 20min for our drinks to arrive.  I asked the waiter if he was the only one serving our section of the dining room which is massive.  He said \"No but for some reason the manager wants me to wait on tables on the patio as well\".  I said that makes no sense at all when you have at least 30 people in the dining room to deal with.  Drinks arrived and it was the wrong ones.  We then saw a waitress walk around to random tables asking if this order was theirs.  

Everyone seemed lost.  Manager looked like he was just clueless, I really feel sorry for the waiters at this location. Worst management ever.  

Oh after we had one drink we knew it would be forever before we received a second one so we didn't bother and just got the bill.  Bill arrives and waiter takes off, didn't even ask if we needed the machine.  So we just walked up to the entrance and paid our bill at the terminals and left.  

We walked across the street to Earls and got great service and the Thursday special was $5 pints of all their beers.  Great decision to leave Bier Markt sq1, epic fail of a place."}
{"text":"They rarely ever have all the beers listed on the menu.  Best beer to order is the Delirium.  Don't bother with the food its very over priced and small portioned."}
{"text":"I don't understand Montrealers automatic assumption that any restaurant that is part of a chain must be inherently bad. 

Montrealers are just not used to chains from away coming to town. Few do as Quebec laws and society make it so difficult to do business here. 

Yes this is part of a Toronto based chain. So what?

It happens to be a successful chain (hence the expansion). 

Montrealers should be glad to have an expanded choice of places to eat and fill the void between the over the top pretentiousness and trendiness of the likes of Toqu√© and au pied de cochon, and la belle province and schwartz's. 

This is a well crafted concept with a fantastic menu and an amazing beer list. They are passionate about their food and beer and the service is pretty good too. 

Don't like it don't go there but don't criticise them for doing something different if they do it well. 

I have been a fan of the Biermarkt since I first encountered them in Toronto. 

I even tried to work for them. That didn't work out but I still love the atmosphere, menu and service. The Montreal location is ideal. In the old queue de cheval building they have turned down the pretentiousness of the old decor with their take on warm European pub/brauhaus chic. 

As ever the menu is an inspired and tasty nod to basic European staples like moules frites and schnitzel both pork and veal. 

I had the bavette with fries cooked a perfect medium rare. Ask for a side of curry Mayo with your frites. 

Our server Daphne was attentive and friendly. 

The only negative I could find was the spider webs on the column above our table beautifully spotlighted by the light over the table. Time to follow up with the cleaning crew about high dusting! 

Definitely a great addition to downtown dining. 

Will be back. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Go here on an evening if you want beer spilled on you by bros. It's a big spacious joint for a pub night out with a wide selection of international beers. It's good for a large group for post-work drinks. 

Now it has live music (crappy cover bands) and horrible crowds when they shut down the seated dining area. The service will rush you to settle your food bill to head to the bar. I'd go early to avoid the drunken gong show later at night. 

The food is surprisingly authentically European (think German beer hall)."}
{"text":"I've been at other biermarkts a few times before but this time at this location I wasn't impressed. Me and my girlfriend both ordered a steak frites for dinner. Both our steaks were incredibly tiny when  we got them. Menu said 7oz steaks but we got 5 pieces that were probably less then 1oz each. Also I swapped for onion rings and my meal only came with 6...

Felt really ripped off since both of our meals were $22...

Overpriced and under whelming. Won't be going back."}

As I was about to go back in the guard stopped me and made me wait back in line this was after I told him I've been in there for an hour and half. The stamp I had on when I first got there was almost worn off.

Not really going back there. People got to bars to relax and have a good time not deal with the staffs snotty attitude and power tripping guards."}
{"text":"Prices very high, customer service mediocre at best (although they really do try), food good assuming you don't get sick like I did.

M'lady and I decided to try a Bier Markt location yesterday, and all-in-all, I wasn't insanely impressed. M'lady said that it was the best place I'd ever taken to, however I found our server to be not overly attentive, where she had to be reminded by her co-workers who were bringing us the next dish to clear off out table of the plates we were done using for a while by that point.

I had oysters, which we're suspecting is what made me nauseous for the rest of the night, as we shared the rest of the food m'lady and I had, and she never got sick. We also found it interesting that the server advertised their main beer as \"going down easy as it's only got 5% alcohol in it,\" yet m'lady felt intoxicated after a single pint.

The prices were quite high, although to a point I would've expected that from what I had heard from this chain.

So all-in-all, I'll likely try another Bier Markt location, but this specific one I very doubt I'll be going back to."}
{"text":"I expect the standard beer joint: large selection of draft beers and greasy bar foods.  Surprise!  It has large selection of draft beers and very good restaurant foods.  Of course, there are also many greasy selections, but that was not the emphasis.

I got mussels and frites!  Really?  Mussels were reasonably rendered.  Then there is a cup of standard fries on the side.  Hmm...  The \"suggested beer pairing\" was Amber Ale and I got the one the waitress recommended.  It was good.

I suspect this be a loud place in the evening when local or mall goers try to get a snack break.  For this Friday lunch, it was sparsely populated."}
{"text":"This evening, I experienced a less than average dinner at Bier Markt. My grilled chicken sandwich was unequally portioned. There was hardly any chicken compared to the bread. There was too much spicy mustard sauce smeared onto the bread itself that it made the sandwich too spicy to eat. The onion rings which I payed $1 extra for were not fresh out of the fryer. They tasted frozen. The risotto was not very good either. It tasted quickly put together and was not creamy. It was rather dry and the arborio rice was not cooked all the way through - not even al dente. The Markt platter of 3 meats was average quality, and the portion size did not reflect the $18 price. 

Lastly, the one beer I ordered arrived with a third of the glass being filled with foam. 

The overall service from our waitress was not the best. She never smiled or offered dessert, coffee, or any menu suggestions. 

I feel like Bier Mrkt does not offer value for the experience. The beer was not even poured properly and the food was similar to most chains."}
{"text":"Ordered the wurst menu and man they had one of the wursts that was a star surrounded by 2 OK ones :(

I'm not sure which one was the star but I really liked it.  The other 2 were alright.  The platter though was ridiculous.  I mean for the price I thought I was just getting 3 wursts.  Nope, I was wrong.  It also came with 2 large pretzels, 2 small salads and a block of cheese.  Dear lawd I could not finish it and that's not something you hear from me often.

The staff were superstars that day minus our server.  Our server was ok but everyone else were more than accommodating trying to get a large group together that was split apart from the start.  The patio is pretty awesome and at an awesome intersection.  The beer selection isn't bad at all either!  I think I'd come back here if I was in the area and needed a place to chillax."}
{"text":"Sorry that I didn't go elsewhere. The Pretzel-Breaded Calamari just seems like regular calamari, unless they simply meant that it was going to be over-salted, which it was. The onion rings were fried at too low a temperature, because they were soaked in oil. The Pastrami Style Salmon was so overpowering flavoured with mustard and spices that it will almost impossible to tell that it was salmon at all, And what's with the Frank's Red Hot with everything. Really, can't make your own tasty sauce, you need to just put out Frank's on everything.

Don't go here for the food. Even if it says \"Resto\" first on the front window. The food was apparently a complete afterthought."}
{"text":"After an awful experience at Jack Astors, we escaped to Bier Markt and were greeted and sat immediately by a friendly hostess. Our drink orders were taken promptly. They had a delicious imperial stout that was like liquid s'mores, exclusive to the restaurant chain.  Meat and cheese plate was over-priced but the quality was good, portions reasonable enough. Being a Sunday evening, they were out of a few beers, which is understandable, but they had plenty of alternatives so everyone was happy. Great service, friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is my first time at the shops on don mills location. I've always gone to the esplanade location and it was wonderful, but this experience has been so negative at the shops on don mills location I don't even want to come back to this chain. Last night (Friday) at 10 pm we went to the bier markt without reservations asked for a table of six. We were not greeted by the hostess but we had to walk up and get her attention. We told her our party was for 6 people. We were actually celebrating 2 birthdays. The hostess told us that the wait will be 30 minutes or more (expected). She also proceeded to tell us there's no tables and we can go ask the table by the bar if they're leaving soon or if we can sit with them (pardon?). I didn't know we had food court table seating? I've never been asked that at a restaurant before. Then another hostess joins in and tells the other host to no don't do that because there's a reservation coming in. Okay? So we stand there and wait for 5-10 minutes our party of 6 and the hostess then has the audacity to tell us to not stand where we are standing and I quote: \"could you guys move and not stand there? You're blocking the door. You guys can stand outside or go for a walk. I'll call you when the tables ready and it won't be for a while.\" Excuse me? It's -10 outside, it's 10 pm all the stores are closed and you didn't take down my information how would you call me ?  It felt like we were basically asked to leave the restaurant at that point. We weren't blocking the enterence we were simply standing in the waiting area..and no one was coming in anyway. Where do your guests wait for tables normally when it's busy? Do you kick everyone out? we left our phone number with the hostess and left. Went outside and discussed how rudely we were treated and decided to go spend our money across the street at Taylor's landing. We were certainly not treated in the same manor we were treated there. The hostesses are the first interaction with your guest and I highly suggest they learn to smile, use please and thank you's, and perhaps some coaching on how to be a good hostess because with that atttitude and those mannerisms you're certainly bound turn loyal patrons away."}
{"text":"We went for dinner last night.

We have been going for years and the beer menu needs a little of a shakeup.  There is a fantastic selection but after a while it would be good to have speciality limited beers.

The food as always is great and the server was who has been there for many years is really knowledgeable and friendly.  He knows the beers as well as all of the food selections very well.

This was the second time that we have had to remind the hostesses of our seating number.  They assign you a number an after an hour they hadnt called us.  After reminding them and standing near the hostess station they found a table in minutes.  This was the second time this had happened."}
{"text":"Beer selection pretty OK but slightly mundane ie. hard to order a totally solid flight without settling for some dull choices. There are tiny bars in Toronto that offer more & better tap selections.

Service kind of terrible with failure to bring right beers or, if they ran out putting in a substitution without asking what we'd like. * What's the point of ordering a flight if THEY pick the beers?? *

Food-wise the burgers were like ground up pencil erasers, really bad texture and dry. Such a waste of potentially magnificent cow. The fries did not make up for the lack of awesomeness.

A fairly inexcusably bad & somewhat overpriced experience; I honestly felt embarrassed to bring someone here, because with craft beer you don't want to scare people away. Beer and food should be pleasure not pain."}
{"text":"Great service, mediocre salads.. ordered the market salad with salmon and the salmon was the size of a toonie. The salad was very plain."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant, and I wasn't completely satisfied with my time there. 

What made me extremely disappointed was the wait time for the food to come out. And when it did it mostly came out all at the same time (apps and mains). 

The food isn't too pricey, and the items are fairly delicious. I just think that with the kind of service we had, there are definitely better places.

What made me give this place 3 stars :: Our waitress was extremely knowledgable with the beers they had, and with the items on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of family and friends on a Friday night. We decided on Bier Markt instead of downtown Toronto since we were a larger crowd. They have a huge selection of drinks, great taste in music, and also a live band.


*** -1 star for making us Californians wait outside in the cold on an early Friday night."}
{"text":"I am the first person to stand up and say that the act of cooking in a restaurant is closer to art than science or skill, but I really take offence to the concept that the difference between \"medium-rare\" and \"rare\" is a matter of interpretation. I'd like to convince myself that the confusion in my meal this evening can be explained by the loud ambiance and a miscommunication with my harried waitress, Beth, but it just isn't so: these folks don't know how to grill a steak properly. 
The frites and beer selection were very good."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Service was great! Great prices! Definitely ask for Kim. She is the sweetest and most amazing waitress."}
{"text":"When bier market first came to mississauga, I was so excited. I  Love the one downtown, even the one in Etobicoke is pretty good. I don't know how these guys have managed to screw it up so badly. Here is a breakdown of the few times I've been here, over the past few months-
1) The first time we came, we went for oysters and fries. Husband decided he was still hungry, got some kind of sandwich (can't remember which now, sorry!).. fries were fine, but they should be. They're fries. Food is actually predictably good (read, not bad) but nothing special. However, I didn't like that I had to basically walk the server through his job- we had ordered 12 oysters, 4 from each bay, and I had to ask him which were which. Then, like a flash he started to leave (um, it was mid afternoon, not busy!), and I had to call him back because we wanted to know what the accompaniments were. Plus, it took a really long time to get our beers, and my poor water glass never got refilled. Anyway, no big deal- they're new, servers are new, managements new- they just need to catch their flow, right?? If only.... 

There were a few times from this point on when I grabbed a quick drink and a bite with friends. If I could rely on consistent service, I would have been happy. Nope. 

2)  this time, night time. I (regrettably) convinced a friend to move his Saturday evening birthday celebration to bier market (he had wanted to do Failte- another failure place in my eyes). I ordered food- salad (their salads are all pretty decent)- but it took over an hour and I just ended up cancelling it as I had to go and was tired of waiting. The bar staff was much better at this point though, they were quick, friendly and knowledgable. So, again, not sure if it was a wait staff problem or a kitchen problem, but I don't appreciate ordering food and never getting it. Poor form.

3) ) husband and I came BACK, for another mid afternoon lunch. We just don't learn, apparently. He didn't like anything about his poutine. I got my standard salad and some blonde beer. Decent. But the length of time it takes for the food to come out makes me wonder what would happen if the restaurant were busier. 

Oh, and why do the little girls at the front always seem to have an attitude? Firstly, attitude in the service industry doesn't fly. It particularly doesn't fly when you're a suburban convenience, as opposed to a downtown destination. Get over yourselves and do your jobs please, kids. 

I know this review comes off as mean. But my point is, there are less expensive options with friendlier, faster, better staff, and simply offering convenience and decent food just doesn't cut it. In the afternoon, the place is empty and everyone looks bored, and at night it's too crowded and the staff still look miserable. The crowd at night is disgusting, too. Like, just people I would rather not have to be close to in public. 

I'm over this place."}
{"text":"Don't go to the Bier Markt. They are bullshit when it comes to bringing in innocent cupcakes to celebrate someone's birthday. They went as far as saying that we may \"poison people\" around us with the cupcakes. The GM guarded us at the entrance making sure NOTHING comes in. We were forced to go outside to eat. What's stopping me from giving these cupcakes to the people in line? The management would keep coming back to our table to make sure we weren't sneaking in any cupcakes. 

Their service is so slow. Their menu's gone down hill and they FORCE you to choose from fixed menus if you have a party size of 15+. I originally booked for 20 but since the pre-fixed menus were garbage I was forced to reduce my invites to eat from their normal menu. They would try and squeeze in my group so they can accommodate other.

If you do go, go for the beer but not for the food. 

If you can, pass this on to all the people you can. I'm super bitter about their bullshit and want to bring them down."}

{"text":"Went with a small group of people and ordered a few apps and shared a main dish.
We started off with the proven√ßale mussels and Frites for $21. It was delicious but so tiny. 
Then we shared the small Charcuterie platter with 3 choices of meat for $15 and the most memorable one was the espresso candied bacon that was so delicious!
I also shared the brasserie chicken $24 for the main which was a white ale spiked chicken Breast,  chargrilled, glazed heirloom carrots, roasted cauliflower pur√®e, fondant potato, saut√®ed black kale and pan roasted chicken jus. This was the highlight of the meal. The chicken was cooked perfectly all nice and juicy and seasoned perfectly. I hate nothing more then overcooked and dry meat and this was far from it. The dish was plated so beautifully. I need to go back just for this dish alone that's how much I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I was invited here with a group that has reserved a section of the bar so we were seated promptly. The decor here is open concept and downtown chic but pretty comfortable. Our waiter for the evening was fabulous and attentive. The selection of beers was outstanding and our waiter was a great guide. All around, the food was quite good. I had the duck wings and they were outstanding. I have to figure out how to make those... I would definitely recommend and will be back to try again."}
{"text":"This place is basically the worst. Bored, unknowledgeable and unresponsive wait staff, OK beer menu, and literally some f the worst food I've had in Toronto. I had an over priced $28 short rib late that way tiny and so bland it was honestly impressive."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time today. We shared the pomegranate jalape√±o wings and each had the market plate special for the day and it was amazing. I definitely recommend this place especially if you are a beer lover."}
{"text":"Yum!

My travel companion and I headed here for our one and only dinner for our weekend in Toronto. Our eyes were a little bigger than our stomachs so we ordered a bit too much, but it was still a delicious dining experience.

After enjoying our beers, we started with the poutine flight. There was a bacon poutine, a mushroom and short rib poutine, and a pastrami poutine. All of it was delicious and smothered in gooey cheese. Can't ask for more.

For our mains, we each got an order of mussels and fries. I got the 'porto fino' which was full of spicy chilies and it was delicious. My friend got the 'a la snob' which had a lobster-based broth which was incredible.

We were freakin' stuffed when we left the restaurant.

Oh, I should mention that I ordered some sort of strawberry beer. It was super girly and sweet, which is not really what I look for in beers usually, but it was an interesting change and hey, it's good try new things.

Our waiter was super nice and surprisingly accommodating, considering how crowded the place was."}
{"text":"A few people and I came to try this place out on a Thursday night and unfortunately we were greatly disappointed. Our server was inattentive, rarely available and did not seem like she wanted to serve us in the first place. I had order a beer which on the menu came in two varieties, 20oz and 1L. I was given the 1L pint without being asked and it took me nearly 20 minutes to get her attention to ask whether I had perhaps made a mistake and ordered the wrong size. Her snippy reply; \"this is the standard size we give for this beer\". Well it would have been nice to have been told this prior to ordering it. Another 20 minutes later she returned and asked if I wanted to downsize it, at this point I had nearly finished half so there was no point. Later in the evening the girls reordered drinks and after the bartender had poured them, it took our waitress again over 20 minutes to bring them over. At this point they were flat and we were not impressed. The place was not busy as we arrive after 11:30pm, the staff seemed to only be interested in chatting amongst themselves and a small group of people who came to the bar. We didn't try the food so I can't comment on that but the service this particular night was lacking tremendously. 

The beer selection is extensive but id recommend sitting at the bar if you're only going to drink as the service seemed more focused on those seated there then at the tables. 

The place is gorgeous though, seems like a nice location for a date or evening out."}
{"text":"A bit of Germany in Toronto. Great beer selection combined with some great traditional German food."}
{"text":"So down for Bier Markt. If you needed groupies, I would fly back from Vancouver for you. Luckily, you have a loyal following already so no need for the drastic measures. Live cover band on Saturday, did you remix No Diggity? Kick ass. 

Brie cheesecake. No questions. Just do it. 

I was recommend calling for a reservation, it was really busy by 9 p.m. 

Recomend x100"}
{"text":"Go for the beer and live music. The selection for drinks is pretty vast although they could use some more (good) porters and stouts. Otherwise, the service is slow, and the food is just so-so."}
{"text":"Sexist business forces female employees to wear skimpy outfits, while the men can wear normal clothes. Shame on you! http://globalnews.ca/news/2316618/bier-markt-backtracks-on-skimpy-dress-code-for-female-employees/"}
{"text":"Came here for a late brunch with the hubs and a friend last weekend, where we soaked up a bit of sun on the patio.  Not *too* much sun though, as the large umbrellas covering the tables provided perfect shade. 

Had the Bavarian Benny ($13), where traditional potato rosti replaces the traditional English biscuit.  A thick cut of porchetta sits on top, accompanied by poached egg and plenty of Weissbier hollandaise over everything.  Bonus: extra hollandaise on the side on request was granted with no extra charge.  I had planned on ordering some beef fat-fried French fries because this stuff is so much better than regular/vegetable oil type (admittedly, on the French fries scale my top pick is still duck fat).  The Benny was very filling though, so I'm glad I skipped it this time. 

The friend ordered a strawberry Fruli to wash down his skillet sausage meal.  It was the first time I'd ever seen Fruli served in a glass before, and apparently it's because Fruli is available on tap here - though I feel like Fruli is one of those things that just looks nicer in a bottle.  I like to say Fruli a lot.  

While Bier Market isn't my top choice for brunch, it's decently priced, cheaper and has a higher value feel for lunch than the other restaurants in the shopping plaza."}
{"text":"I just have to say this place has a lot of choices of beer around the world. We ordered fruity one, which they tasted great because we like sweet beer."}
{"text":"Very knowledgeable waitstaff who really knows their beers. If you're not sure what you like, they can make suggestions or even have you try a few to be sure. 

The cheese platter is delicious: go for the 5 option! You really can't go wrong. This is a great share plate. 

I was here on a Thursday from 4 PM to 8 PM and it was incredibly loud; couldn't have a conversation without yelling at the top of my lungs. So that was slightly unpleasant but if that's what you're looking for, you're in the right place!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some good beer, decent eats, spotty service and just the right amount of sleaze, this is your joint right here.

I must admit that there are plenty of great restaurants in the St. Lawrence Market area that I could (and should) be visiting, but my friends and I have instead made this one of our preferred destinations. For a Cara-owned operation, this Bier Markt is on the spectrum of what I like to call a \"premium dive bar\".

The location itself is solid, just a couple minutes walk from Union and nestled in-between a mix of high and low end joints like a Keg, a Tilted Kilt and a bunch of one-off bistros. 

Come in here and you'll certainly be entertained by the... flora and fauna. I'm still trying to figure out if the waitresses are trying to compete with some of these other establishments after hours or this is really what their dress code is, because they rock some of the tightest clothing I've ever seen. You certainly won't be at a loss for entertainment if the conversation isn't up to snuff.

The food is forgettable, by and large. I showed up here for birthday drinks with friends and we settled on apps (onion rings and fries). I understand there are build-it-yourself charcuterie boards you can buy, but based on what I ordered the last time I was here last time (the fish and chips) and this experience, the overall result is just ho-hum. The onion rings in particular were extremely greasy and I found myself giving up and not wanting to clog my arteries any further after a couple bites.

I also ended up going for a Cider Mojito (which was referred to in the past as a \"Swedish Mojito\", if one of the bar's past menus is anything to go by), which had Sommersby, strawberry coulis and mint. You can always tell when a restaurant's specialty drinks are up to snuff if they can make a good mojito - and this one delivered. The only quibble I have is that it was very clear that they pulled out frozen fruit to put in this -- not so much a problem if you're not planning to consume said fruit, but it was for me.

The biggest problem, and the one that's most mentioned, is the service. Some of the wonkiest variations in attentiveness I've seen in a while. One table away, a waitress attempted to cram 9(!) people into a 4-person booth, with three of them standing awkwardly in the aisle as servers rushed by until someone finally told them there was another table available. Our server was a woman who was clearly up to her limit and sporting an attitude, yet she oscillated from passive-aggressiveness to somehow remembering my drink order an hour after I called it in, and it wasn't even that busy. 

Another waitress brought me a Diet Pepsi (hey, shut up, I'm trying to diet) and laughed at me behind my back! What's up with that? Maybe she should check out her own butterface before she makes a crack at a customer who tipped her well last time.

There's some good stuff to like here. Bier Markt's a solid spot to hang out with friends and there could be some good menu items, but a decent neighborhood bar is about all it is."}
{"text":"This was one of the best finds while in Montreal. I was with some friend and we were going to watch hockey at the Bell Centre, but wanted to get a few beers before the game. BM looks like a chain restaurant from the outside, but the food is really good quality and service is top notch. I suggest sitting on the first level either at the bar or in the back by the grill.

We went twice in one day and the service was awesome both times. Get the charcuterie! I highly recommend the Serrano Ham, pate, and potted chicken liver mousse. 

They have a tremendous selection of beer. It seems like you really can't go wrong! There's an awesome tripel for only $5 although I can't remember the name. It's 9% alcohol. Ask for it."}
{"text":"Didn't like the beer or the food. Found it too pricy for mediocre food. I would suggest trying another place like Earl's or Cibo wine bar."}
{"text":"Looked forward to this visit but alas I was disappointed. Good beer selection and the food was decent but the service was way below what I would have expected. But then again I expect a lot. Server kept disappearing for long periods of time when drinks were empty in an empty restaurant. I would have thought that if we were the only table in your section we would be well attended to. Even too much. But the resident boy friend in the corner took up most of her time. Ridiculous. 

We won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been to this place 3 times now and it's pretty good. It's known for a having a wide selection of beer. There's at least 100+ types of beer available! If you don't like drinking beer, then I don't recommend this place. There's not a lot of food choices and it's a bit pricey. The poutines are good though.

The atmosphere is very casual; you don't have to dress up that much although I recommend dressing at least semi-casual. You can chill at the bar or choose to be seated at a table or the patio. There's a bunch of TVs around the bar which is good for watching sports. There's also a live cover band that starts playing at 9pm every night.   

The only complaint I have about this place is that the service was pretty slow but it's to be expected since the bar is fairly new and we came on a Saturday night. However, if this place does not pick up the pace then they could potentially lose customers.

Overall, it's a good place to chill with your friends and drink lots of beer! Not suited for eating though."}
{"text":"Schnitzel was okay and fondue was so-so... Great beer selection though"}
{"text":"I experienced The Bier Markt twice, once in the summer and the other in the winter. I came here in the Summer and sat in the patio outside - they have plenty of patio seating with huge umbrellas. I ordered the haddock and chips. It wasn't the best haddock ever, but it was steaming hot but a little too breaded. 

The second time I was here was for lunch with coworkers. We ordered a few apps to start - the breaded calamari, yam fries, and the garlic hummus dip. The breaded calamari was super yummy. It did take a while for the mains to arrive. I ordered the mushroom and goat cheese burger with the markt salad. It was super delicious but it was too much bread. The salad was good as well - will definitely consider having it next time as a meal. Overall the food was good but perhaps not for the price and it didn't help that the service was slow on a Friday lunch."}
{"text":"This is the third location of Bier Markt I've been to, but second time I've been to this location. This time we actually got in.   I've always been a fan just because of the selection of beers they have.  Last night I had  Banana Bread and Mort Subite Kriek beers.  My gf had the Somersby Cider.  

They don't have a buzzer system or waiting area.  They will call your phone when your table is ready.  I guess whatever works right.  It is a bit smaller than the King St and Esplanade locations.  I haven't been to the Shops @Don mills one yet. 

First we shared the cheese & prosciutto charcuterie board.  Few slice of proscuitto, thinly sliced salami, some cheese, pickled veggies and grilled bread. It was kind of odd to see the mustard in squeezable tubes though.  I guess it was made for portioned amounts, but still.  

For dinner, I ordered the beef brisket with grits and coleslaw.  It was a good portion of brisket but the brisket was very fatty. The cole slaw was kind of dry and the grits were crispy but a bit on the salty side. My gf ordered the veal schnitzel which were two pieces of panko-crusted veal (just a bit crispier than a California Sandwiches veal), a couple of aspargus on a bed of mashed potatoes. It wasn't bad.  

So the overall service and ambiance were pretty good.  A word of advice is that you need to be there very early or reserve in order to get a table.  The general bar area is very small compared to the Esplanade location, and tends to have some tables that are reserved, which defeats the purpose of  a general seating area.  Luckily we had a seat at the bar while waiting at the table.  Otherwise we would have probably went somewhere else.  I'd only go for the beer choices from now on."}
{"text":"The service was good, but not great, because our waitress didn't seem very knowledgable about the beers when we asked her for help with selecting beers for our beer flights.  
Just a heads up to vegetarians and vegans, if you order the salad without the meat or fish, you'll still get charged the same price."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere! Beer heaven! Always great service! Musi entertainment can be hit or miss, but nevertheless fun times! Yummy food!"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience here. I have been to this location in the past with no issues. I went today only to wait 10mins for a waitress to even offer us water. Then when we finally got our drinks 20mins later.... We had to wait 25mins to get our food. And NO waitress came to check on us or ask if we wanted another drink. When we finally got our order it was inedible and had to wait another 15mins just to let the waitress know. Completely ridiculous, I want answers from management. Why didn't I get an apology from the manager? Or even an inquiry. We actually left this location to go somewhere else for dinner. Train your staff better and management. I would not recommend coming to this location at all. They don't care for your business."}
{"text":"I don't don't to give this place 3 stars because o really did like it... but it is a 3 star place. I sat outside on a beautiful day and they sat me at a lovely booth in the shade even though I was just one person. The server was very attentive and we even had a great girly conversation at the end. I loved the food options too. The share board had so many options! Most of which you don't typically find on a charcuterie plate. But... they ran out of two different wines I tried to order and as beautiful as the share board was, most of what I got was mediocre at best. The salmon was ok... they put way to much mustard on it for my taste. The smoked Gouda pieces were like rubber. I actually didn't eat more than one piece and the prosciutto was not very fresh. I loved the tuna and the bread was really good (I don't let myself eat a lot of carbs). Despite all that I actually do want to go back and try their other options like the muscles and oysters. I hope to give them a higher rating next time!"}
{"text":"C'est apr√®s avoir fait 3 pubs avec des files d'attente (tout √† fait normal lors de la St-Patrick, je sais haha) qu'on a d√©cid√© d'aller au Bier Markt... finalement l'attente aurait value la peine!

Pour au moins se mettre un peu dans l'ambiance de la f√™te, nous avons command√© une Guinness. Malheureusement celle-ci go√ªtait l'eau... bon commencement haha

Nous avons ensuite command√© chacune une pizza. J'ai choisi la pizza poulet fum√© et pesto et mon amie a choisi celle aux saucisses √©pic√©es. 
Ma pizza √©tait correcte, mais lorsque mon amie a commenc√© √† s'√©touffer avec un cheveux qui avait clairement cuit dans sa pizza et pas seulement juste tomb√© sur le dessus, ma pizza ne semblait plus autant bonne lol je pr√©cise que mon amie avait les cheveux attach√©s, donc ce n'√©tait pas le sien 

La manager est venu nous voir et nous dire que la pizza ne serait pas charg√© (thank god) et qu'elle pouvait prendre ce qu'elle voulait sur le menu. Elle a choisi les frites de patates douces. Selon elle c'√©tait correct.

Nous avons eu du mal tout au long de la soir√©e avec le service. Notre serveuse √©tait absente et essayer de capter son attention √©tait devenu un petit jeu pour nous.

Bref, il y a tellement plus de bons restos au centre-ville... je ne crois pas y retourner."}
{"text":"Thrice I've been dispositioned at the Saturday night line-up at the Bier Markt on King Street West, thrice I've managed to evade entering the premissses.  Once some girl forgot her ID, another time it took too long...whatever the reason, I've been quite fortunate with not having to experience that shabby crowded location.  

A few days prior to me leaving for China, I was possessed by the Ghost of Lower Expectations and somehow ended up booking a table for three at the Don Mills Location.  
I came here with Amber, and Jayce.  We came here with the notion of celebrating my trip to China, but with the sarcasm of these two lovely ladies, it felt more like a celebration of getting my ass out of North America.  YAY Raymond is leaving...PARTAYYY.  I felt like homework...

I never expected that the Bier Markt would be anything close to comfortable, especially considering the entrance to this location is just about as welcoming as an North America Nightclub.  
Our waitress was friendly, big non-prescription frames...but not quite hipster (since she had to work and had to look like a working human being).  She was very casual, but I wasn't offended.  I'd like to think it was because that I felt very relaxed, but truth is probably because of the rightness..I mean the tightness of her dress.  

They sure had a lot of beer!  Even Tsingtao, which is the beer of my hometown.  I ordered a pint of the Leffe, Amber had a bottle of the Red Stripe, and I think Jayce had something less exotic.  
I ordered enough food to fill my reasonably swell belly, Jayce & Amber thought otherwise, and doubted whether if I could finish all the food.  This was one area in life that I never disappoint.
Flat bread, half dozen oysters, some kind of pasta I think.  Between the three of us, we ordered just shy of $200 worth of food.  I ate about $180 worth.  
I was really taken by surprise by the atmosphere, even after when it hit 10pm, it did not become too loud.  This would most likely not have been the case if it was King West.  
I was feeling very mellow that night, and I guess I was not fully aware of the quality of the service.  I didn't have a problem, but the ladies were less than impressed.  
One of the waiters dropped a piece of our flatbread, so he went back into the kitchen to get a completely different order..what a waste of food!  He did also leave the piece of flatbread for our hipsteresk waitress to pick up five minutes later.  
Also, one of my orders was forgotten...but again I didn't complain.  

It turned out Both Amber and I had something to celebrate.  I was finally going to back to China for my 13 year long awaited half year vacation, and Amber (after being featured in the Financial Post) was offered a BAR position at a big New York Law Firm.  I can see Jayce getting slightly uncomfortable with our eventful lives...I tried to convince her to join me on my trip.  I guess we all had something to envy from one another.  I totally wanted to be featured in the Financial Post..

A very very relaxed evening, at a unexpectedly warm atmosphere.  With emphasis on variety, the Beer Markt is a more than suitable place for a couple of friends just to hang out, and have some simple food and complex comversation.

The next day: Jayce checked-in at the airport departing to an undisclosed location, and I was featured (okay mentioned/referenced) in the Financial Post!  =DDD

HAPPY ENDINGS!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, hundreds of choices for the beers and the foods incredible. Reminds me of a Prague restaurant or somethin in amsterdam, def a place u have to check out if ur in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great food- chicken wings and or duck wings great! 
Excellent wine and lambic choices.
Ambiance and service are always excellent even this place gets pack and super busy!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! It wasn't as crazy packed on Saturday compared to the ones in Toronto but yet there were not table left alone.

We had a bachelor party and this was one of the location... The manager was nice enough to keep a table for us, but as we were going to spent quite a few bucks we worked our way in getting the Chef's table. You might ask whats a Chef, table well its an area separate kind of a both with a massive table and nice chair. All thanks to the awesome manager for being accommodating.  

Staff: Not just the manager was good but even the girl serving us was very friendly and fast in deal with all the orders. The security guards were awesome and friendly too.

Menu: I wouldn't go much in detail on this as the menu on drinks is quite extensive here and you will have to pay up for imported stuff.

Live band was quite good and their song choices were awesome... Lots of Tvs to catch the games as well. If you are planning to drive there is plenty of parking"}
{"text":"When it is really busy there are not a lot of servers. So the service is very slow. Management problem"}
{"text":"The food has not kept up with what I remember, although it isn't bad by any means. The beer selection is great, and the crowd can be a really fun mix so I never mind waiting in line to come here, although I have walked away from it a couple of times because a 40 minute wait at 1:30 am is just unreal."}
{"text":"Super short and sweet!...

I came here just for a quick drink to kill time before going to dinner in the area. I went straight to the bar and wanted to try something new so the bartender recommended the Palm Speciale Belge, she gave me a little taste to see if I liked it. It was perfect for what I was feeling that night! She was very friendly and clearly knows her beers!

Now I can add a new one to my list!"}
{"text":"Thursday night?  Must be Dollar oyster night at Bier Markt.  So off a large group of us went to share some fun, plenty of drinks and some pretty good food!

We had an early reservation which was good as this place fills up fast!  We were seated inside- but on a perfect night- the patio is really where you want to be.

Our server, Lindsey, was just terrific- helpful, friendly, and with a lilting laugh that made her just seem like a part of our group.

We had so much to eat- I'll just highlight a couple of the wins.  

First of all, as I began this review- Dollar oysters on Thursdays.  Fresh and delicious- if you like oysters- this is your place!

Second- the beer list.  HUGE!  I've been to other beer bars but this place surely tops them all.

From an entree standpoint- the nicoise salad with grilled salmon, the mussels Provencal and the steak were all a hit.  The grilled ahi tuna had all the potential of being notable but it did come overcooked so if you get it- be super specific about what rare means or it will come overdone as was the case with two in our group.

Finally- dessert.  The gluten free chocolate mousse cake was the hit of the night as were the Belgian waffles.  Both \"calorie worthy\".

Given this is located in an open air mall- the people watching is quite spectacular and the hostess also told us there is often live music as well as the evening goes on.

Great service, good food and a location that makes you want to sit and stay awhile.  Sounds like a winner to me!"}
{"text":"Great beer !!!! Over 100 beers on tap... the only bar in Montreal that sells Frul√Ø beer. The food is very good as well.... I had the shnitzel once, the poutine, mini burgers... tries almost everything on their menu and would go back any tine to try them again. The only negative thing for me is that now they have a live band on Fridays... if you stay downstairs its pretty loud."}
{"text":"A touristy restaurant that lacks attention to the clientele, and quality of food. 

Our latest visit to Bier Markt for a weekday lunch turned out to be nothing else but an expensive disappointment. 
Although I have been to Bier Markt twice before, this last experience took me by surprise as to how things changed for the worse. 
Upon our arrival for a 1:30pm weekday lunch, we were seated upstairs to a very small, uncomfortable table, in a very dark sector. Quite depressing. I suppose the bright big TV and the blasting terrible music was the only thing that kept that sector lively. 

While looking around, I've noticed that there was another sector upstairs with windows and far more spacious and better ambience. Sadly, we paid the unexpected consequences of having a worse waiter service. 

Shortly after we sat down, our waiter arrived. So far things are going OK. Right away we ordered our meals. Mussels in a sauce and a chicken burger with fries. We were a table of two and both times our waiter was quite pushy in offering us sweet potato fries instead for $1.00 extra. Of course that an extra dollar for his tip. We said, no. 

Since we arrived for a late lunch at 1:30pm, we are quite hungry. So our 45 minute wait for mussels and a chicken burger was not sitting well for either one of us. Finally our meals have arrived. Not once did our waiter took the time to apologize till I very kindly mentioned the such long wait. His response and I quote \"Oh sorry, our kitchen staff had gone on break when I placed in your order, I'm sorry about that\"  Somehow my appetite was being replaced by frustration. As soon as we took a bite of our meal, both of our fries were cold and soggy. The mussels were warm-ish. My sandwich, well the bread was rubbery, the chicken was cooked till dry as sand paper. Again, I politely called our waiter and mentioned the fries. He said, oh sorry about that. Let me get you another batch. Soon after our waiter returns to our table and informs us that the fries will take about 5 minutes since they didn't have a batch made. So we waited, yet again!
Finally,y we finished our meal. I clearly indicated to our waiter that we were not pleased with our meal and the long wait. He simply said \"I'm sorry for that.\" The apology and the service both felt quite cold, short, and very unprofessional for a simple lunch of two people with one beer that costed $55.00"}
{"text":"Yes! Bier Markt with a HUGE, EXPANSIVE, OUTDOOR Patio. It can't get any better than that.

I have always shied (correct spelling?) from the Esplanade location...my memories of that Bier Markt include insane bump and grind in a small area, half of which is taken by some new rock/punk/alternative band blasting away such that I learned how to lip read.

I always thought beer is beer, so if I wanted a cold one, I could go anywhere really. UNTIL...Shops on Don Mills' Bier Markt. My parents and I, after walking, happened to be discussing where we should sit and have a bite. My mom suddenly saw Bier Markt and the rest was history.

There is a non-smoking and smoking patio section, all equally with sunny spots. I have decided to just go down the extensive beer menu to try everything and anything. Because my parents are light drinkers, they opted for the Steigl beer with a low 2.5% alcohol content. It has a grapefruit taste which is so very tasty and refreshing on a hot summers day. It also comes in this very fancy tall, slender glass. My parents ended up ordering 8 of those \"light\" beers. The story behind it is that it is a beer made for cyclists so they can drink without veering of those European cliffs.

In the menu, the drinks with the icons beside the beers are the ones offered on tap.

Food. Lobster rolls are heavenly. On a hot day, there is nothing better than to bite down on a cold, creamy, roll. Lobster salad with fresh watermelon chunks are also very refreshing. My dad had the beet salad which was quite heavy. Good to share as the variety of beets (red, purple, yello) are all very appetizing.

This is my new favorite spot at the Shops on Don Mills. Great food, BEER, and service all under sunny skies."}
{"text":"Bier Markt, an European styled restaurant, is a great gem in the Shops of Don Mills district. The area is beautiful and so is the restaurant. The decor is dark with blacks and reds and gives a very European bistro feel. It has outdoor patio that was well situated and expansive. However some can argue that the decor is too dark and dank. In addition, live music plays at certain times. The music tends to be rock/punk/alternative rock, which is great addition to the atmosphere. Having gone there for brunch, the menu offered great variety from French cuisine to Belgian beers. We ordered the poutine and steak. The poutine was amazing, not as great but comparable to Montreal's poutine kings 'Resto La Banquise ,'a definite must buy. The steak was decent and satisfactory, nothing to tell your mother about. Service was prompt and the waiter was great. She took care of us well and made great conversation. Recommend us great food and constantly checked up on us. If you are ever in the area, definitely play this place a visit."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate our 3 month wedding anniversary and had wanted to try this place for awhile now. We went at around 6:30 so just before the dinner rush on a Friday evening.

I ordered the steak with mashed potatoes and mushrooms. She ordered a burger with fries. I ordered the Stiegl Radler and she got the beer flights(set of 4 sample beers)

The food was decent BUT overpriced for similar quality at another less expensive chain restaurant. 

Our original server went MIA and some random man(maybe the manager?) came up to us to ask if we had been looked after -- we were waiting for almost half an hour at that point with no water or drink order. He was apologetic and served us for the rest of the night. Our food came after waiting for over 45 minutes. Again, the manager/server guy apologized but we were just over it at that point. 

As we were leaving, I noticed other people looking upset and irritated due to wait time and lack of attention.

I definitely wouldn't recommend this place as you can find the better quality food for those prices at a nicer restaurant."}
{"text":"Dinner with friends for a birthday. Overall experience, including the food, was mediocre."}
{"text":"I had my first experience here and was sadly disappointed.  The staff was very friendly however I felt it to be a bit to much. My server asked my name and then proceeded to call me by an awkward nick name for the rest of the night. It took almost 30 minutes to get my first beer, and then getting a refill was near impossible. Finally after about 45 min we ordered the apps. I had the crab dip. Very salty and not enough pita bread to finish the dip and our server was no where to be found to order more. Second course was veal schnitzel and unfortunately it was way over cooked and had no flavour. I was disappointed in the char coal after taste and very chewy texture of the beef.   For desert I had the donuts and banana waffle. Both of these items were stale and also extremely disappointing. Atmosphere was impressive to watch a game but other then that it was a bust. Apparently they have a band but I left before things livened up."}
{"text":"Two of us came for lunch on a Thursday.   We were seated on the patio by the hostess  After 10 minutes of no server, I went looking for the hostess to see if we could please have a server.  She seemed confused, but finally one presented herself.  The server was clearly hired for her ability to fill out the uniform and bend over in short skirts & not her serving skills.

Both of us ordered the same thing: fish & chips.  The server was unable to repeat that back.  No, I'm not kidding.  She looked at my friend and said \"fish & chips\" then looked at me and said ... fish ..... and ..... frites ?????  

The fish & chips arrived quickly (not by the server) but we still didn't have our drinks.  We pointed that out to the food runner & they quickly appeared.  

The server then decided she needed to check on us every five minutes.  That wasn't annoying, nope, not a bit.  When we ordered coffee, she touched every side of the cup she could getting it down on the table - I guess she didn't realize if it's on a saucer, you hold the saucer?

The food was good, the service was terrible.  I will never be back."}
{"text":"Take this place for what it is, a top notch pub with great beer and good music.

I am shocked at all these 2 star ratings, this place is great! Mind you, I've never eaten dinner here before apart from at a private work function where everything was catered.

I've been here for:

- casual afternoon beers before the raptors game
- private work function with ~50 ppl
- a few memorable nights on the town

I've never been disappointing.

The service here is always top notch (friendly, attentive, quick). 

The beer selection is some of the best in the city with beers from all around the world.

And my favourite part is the cover bands that do exclusively top 40, pop, and get a great crowd of people up and dancing.

I honestly have had nothing but positive experiences here and would highly recommend everyone check this place out at least once."}
{"text":"Meah...

The entire experience for me was just that...  meah

From the people who greeted us at the doors to the ones that were apparently servicing us to the ones that did something in the middle while we ate.  

All meah..."}
{"text":"150 beers available is almost worth 5 stars on its own. The well done and laid out beer menu is almost worth 5 stars (well done to the owners on that one!!) 
The food was above average as well. This will be on my must stop again list for sure."}
{"text":"While the ambiance and beer selection are exquisite, the service definitely leaves something to be desired. 

The beer menu is very impressive, and the pairings are helpful. 

The problem is in the service. We had to ask for water twice, and not enough was delivered for our full party. Not once did they come around offering refills. We were a party of 18, two of the orders were mistaken and neither time did the staff offer to switch it. The service was already slow and we were in a rush, so we didn't bother insisting. I ordered a salad on the menu but asked them to make it \"vegan\" (no meat or dairy). It was a 20$ salad, my two friends next to me ordered the same. Our plates were all the very same size, and in the end we were all charged the same amount...despite me having half of what my two friends received. 

The waiter also short-changed me in the end, acknowledged that he did, then disappeared. Additionally, my cousin was charged for one beer that was never delivered. This could have been avoided had they asked even once if we were satisfied. 

If there is a specific and exotic beer you'd like to try, go to beermarkt. If you are looking for food and service that reflect such a high markup--go anywhere but."}
{"text":"This bar is amazing to me, there are hundreds of beers in over the world. Delirium - a Belgium beer is always my choice when i come here. In summer, you can enjoy the beautiful weather and atmosphere in a patio. There also have some great appetizer u should try. I dont remember exactly the name, its some kind of tacos. You also can order a set of beer to try and expericence all the different tastes."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this place. Great beer selection and excellent live bands on Friday and Saturday night starting around 9 or 10. Foods a bit on the pricey side however. Great patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Apart from a great beer selection there is not much else to like about this place, the food menu is not great and the inside of the place reminds me too much of an underground craphole. 

They do have a patio which gets super busy but its way to noisy with the cars and what have you. 

Many other places around this area to choose from which provide a better experience.

On the weekend when I have been they do have live music so makes the downstairs area a bit more bearable."}
{"text":"Insanely over-rated. I went with a group of friends. We were treated poorly from the beginning. We were pushed around the floor by a bouncer. The waiting staff forgot to put our names down so after waiting for a long time we couldn't get a table and just gave up on food. Had a good time on the dance floor tho. It was more of a clubbing experince for me."}
{"text":"Consistently good food but I wish they would change up the menu once in a while. Would be nice to see new additions to the charcuterie board and a larger selection of wine (I know it's called BIER Markt... but still). Server was super nice and funny. We ordered a round of beer then I decided I wanted wine as well so asked for the Merlot. She asked if I wanted the 5oz or 8oz... I looked at her and said the whole bottle. She came out with it right away. 

Would come back for Delirium and dips!"}
{"text":"not impressed.

been to different locations and had better experiences.

service was slow, server was rude. I get that it was a Friday but not all customers deserve the same service, especially when we had just sat down. 

I don't see myself returning here, I'd rather drive down to Sherway!"}
{"text":"Nice environment and fast and friendly service, with a nice menu. Close to Bell Centre."}
{"text":"We decided on Bier Markt as our after party location after the Jays game. It was busy inside, but we got the two remaining seats at the bar. It was loud, but not overpowering.

Although I only had one beer, I was quite happy with the selection they had on tap and in bottles. Service was fast and pleasant. 

Didn't try any food, not sure if it would have been available anyway since we got there around 11pm.  Would defiantly go back if in the Toronto area and wanted some beers."}
{"text":"My first experience of this place was on a Saturday night where there was some long ass queue to get in and resulted in us drinking more at another pub before coming back when there was not queue. 

That night they had a live band playing and it was very busy and very loud, I think this is a normal Saturday night thing.

There is no dress code or general expectations coming here on any day so the crowd was a mix, including your backwards baseball cap douches so totally not my cup of tea.

More recently came here on a Saturday evening and actually got a seat (temporarily) and was able to sample the beers and menu. I went with the Market Poutine and got the \"SAY WHAT\" when I asked for it without cheese but it still tasted great and went superbly with the awesome Leffe white beer I ordered. 

The beers are a rip off but I guess that's how it works here but the selection is awesome, went through some hoppy beers which my friend ordered but the good thing about this place is the service is great, knowledgeable and this is maintained even when it started to get busy.

Random conversations randomly occur and the only downer is the smell of stale beer when walking into the joint. 

This reminds me very much of my favourite beer house in Estonia except without the Bavarian music, which I would prefer much more than the live bands they have up."}
{"text":"Food - overpriced for what you get.

Patio - good convenient location.

Beer - theoretically solid but they don't seem to have half the things they advertise. Still above average compared to other run of the mill bars.

Atmosphere - average at best.  Feels like it's become dominated by out-of-towners and cougars who don't know where else to go.

Conclusion - not a bad meeting spot for some drinks but don't order any food here."}
{"text":"AWSOME Belgian style restaurant.
Great place to watch the game !
The only thing missing a feather bowling  alley !!
Large beer selection & fantastic food make it a must"}
{"text":"Super clean, super nice staff, and one of the best selections in Toronto.  The patio isn't half bad, either.  Like any place that boasts such a selection as Bier Markt, you're bound to pick a few items that they'll be out of.  Thankfully the servers here are knowledgeable enough to recommend something else.  


And kudos to Mr. Server for recommending my wife's new favorite beer, Fruli."}
{"text":"I have been to the Bier Markt on many occasions, and each time, I feel like the level of service is getting worse. This time, I was joining a group of girlfriends on a Thursday hockey night, there were lots of people and lots of noise so we could hardly hear each other talk but given the circumstances it was ok. Where I found the service to be poor is that at one point our table was simply without a waitress... which of course makes it difficult to order. 

I had to hail a random waiter who was passing by so that he could find a person to take care of us. I ordered a few oysters which weren't my cup of tea, I also had a platter with three choices ($ 18) prosciutto, goat cheese and as I wanted to take risks I went for their red tuna pok√©... which turned out to be brownish, tasteless with extra dry rice. 

In short, what made the experience memorable is much more the company of my friends rather than what was served throughout the evening. I think it's worth going there just to order their real specialty: beer."}
{"text":"We were here for our friends birthday. I really like the atmosphere of Shops of Don Mills...it's like a vibrant, lively collection of outdoor shops on streets. There was this centre field of grass with lights strung above. It was kind of difficult finding the restaurant since there were many similar ones and I couldn't find a directory. We wanted to sit on the patio since it was a beautiful warm day, but they couldn't seat a big group of 8. We ended up inside which wasn't too bad but it had very dim lighting. When we were ordering and waiting for our food, there was dessert being served to another table and it smelled so good like freshly baked cookies.

Everything on the menu is quite pricey. I ordered the small pot of a la snob mussels and frites which also came with a freshly baked baguette. They accidentally mixed up my order and served me a large pot (without charging me the difference of $3 of course). By the way, the large is literally double the size (maybe there were 40 mussles) and I think its meant to be shareable. All the shells had meat in it which was a nice surprise. The mussels were cooked well. I wasn't blown away by the broth as I could barely taste the lobster and it was kind of watered down. The huge pieces of slightly bland leeks and tomatoes didn't really add much flavour but did contribute some unneeded textures to it. The fries were mediocre, not crispy enough, but the baguette did taste very fresh and baked in house. I didn't get an alcoholic beverage but the menu for that was quite extensive."}
{"text":"Met with a bunch of friend here during the Christmas holiday and it was okay.  The beer, of course, was pretty good with a very very wide selection of Belgian beers among others.  It was kinda loud and started to get busy by 8:30 but I snagged a long table at the bar.  My friends were fashionably late and 3 of us had to fend off the vultures from take our chairs or trying to sit @ the end of the table.

As the night drew on, a band started to set up and unfortunately we were seated right in front of them.  Low ceiling, loud bar, and bad cover band  = ears bleeding!  These guys were wailing and it was not pretty.  Somehow, despite their lack of talent, THEY HAD A GROUPIE!! 

There was one great redeeming factor to this place, their \"gourmet\" poutine was really good! A little price but really good and a pretty big serving.

Only reason I probably won't go back is because there are so many places in Toronto and I'm there so little, I gotta try new places."}
{"text":"So, an industry colleague says to me, meet me at the Bier Markt on King Street West.  Okay, never been to a Bier Markt.  When I got there, there was a helluva wait for the patio, so I went inside.  To my surprise, it was cool, lounge like, had stone on the walls, and red light accents.  I liked it.  It was 7:30 and there were still happy hour stragglers.  Many of which were professional women.  I didn't mind.   There were 100 plus brands of beer from many different countries.  I liked it and sampled (drank) many of them.  Their menu was a bit eclectic, but had some cool appetizers.  

At about 10:00 p.m., a very cool band came on that played classic rock.  Not any classic rock mind you, but Jimmy Hendrix, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin.  They claimed to be new playing together, but you would have thought they were veterans.  Excellent addition to the evening.  I would go back there in a heartbeat.  The beer was priced right.  I am from northern NJ and spend a lot of time in NYC, so any draft beer less than seven dollars is a deal to me.  

It was an excellent experience.  I will go there again when I return to Toronto."}
{"text":"Average food over priced. Chicken wings were dry. Ny strip was par.  Not worth 34$. One of the mussels came dry with no sauce and one came with sauce. The best part of my meal was my market salad appetizer.  

Service was OK.  I like a guy who is quick on his feet and can cover a mistake with a joke, but when it's several mistakes, I'm not impressed. My friend had to ask for a spoon for her soup. My friend was missing a beer and I had to ask for a steak knife for my steak. They didn't even remove my appetizer dishes until my meal came.  No one came to ask how everything was after being served our main course. All in all. I would come back for drinks but not for their food."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but most recently came here for diner. This time we tried the Steak Flammekueches Cones off of their spring menu which are basically marinated flank wraped in a naan-style bread with cilantro, mole, pickled onions, and pumpkin seeds, and T-Bone burger.

We asked our waitress about the beef used in the burger and she confirmed that it was real Kobe, and not mixed with any other beef. She even offered to show us the box to prove it was real. The burger was nothing to write home about though. It was char grilled too much for my liking, dry, and not juicy and flavorful like I was hoping it would be. The cook did a real disservice to the meat. The Cones were ok and were at least better than the burger.

The service was really good and made up for the food. We had a really nice, charming waitress and if it weren't for the service I would have probably rated this place a 2 or 3."}
{"text":"There were 2 really really sweet servers we had the night we went. One had red curly hair, I believe she also said she doesn't own a cell phone. The other girl was a brunette. They were really attentive to our table and even remembered some of our names. They made the night really fun!"}
{"text":"Had alot of fun. Very fun vibe late at night with a live band singing. The food tasted great and had a descent price range. I tried the fries, Bangkok Mussels and the Beer Can Chicken. They were all delicious. The big part of the night was the different beers they had to try. They have a large variety and giving me an opportunity to try something new. Had an overall great experience."}
{"text":"Great beer selection! I visited Montreal and this was a great place to get some food and a few beers."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience here.  I only ate a charcuterie board and had a couple beers so I can only relate to those items.  Th beer selection is awesome, and every beer you order not only comes in the proper glass but also comes with the proper coaster with either the brewery name of the actual beer name.  I thought this was a nice touch.  
I am not from Canada but I wish we had this place in the states.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Decided to pick Bier Market for lunch because it had the fish and chips option for my mom, as she loves fish and chips. 

The bier can chicken was good, but was basically a healthy tasting version of chicken noodle soup, without the noodles. 

The dunkel duck wings, were good. A little over cooked but the spicy sauce that came with it helped.

Markt burger was good, came with homey tasting fries. 

Mussel Proven√ßal and frites were good. They came with a unexpected large amount! Small size, but what do you expect considering we live in Toronto. 

Fish Frites was the star! It was perfectly cooked, coated with panko. Not much greasy, probably the best fish and chips I've had in a while. 

The chocolate flour less cake was exactly as described. Very delicious if you like chocolate. 

The creme br√ªl√©e was an excellent portion, biggest portion I've seen. 

Overall, this place left me full and usually when it comes to Summerlicious and Winterlicious, I'm still hungry. Definitely the highlight was the fish frites and creme br√ªl√©e!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night. Got pretty busy quick.  Was not impressed with this King street location.  Much prefer the Esplanade location.  First the live band was cheesy as hell. The music/bass was so high you can't even hear the singer sing.  Lame. 2nd they can't even cook a burger, Ordered the 10oz wagyu beef burger which was to my surprise burnt to a char and they dare to serve that.  Took one bite and all I tasted was burnt meat. Sent it back and had to wait 40 mins for a new one. Really it take you 40 mins to make a burger.  Worst I am not the only one in my group that had problem with our food.  Two people also ordered the steak in well. But it came out burnt and they also had to return it but they decided to change it up to another dish.  Everyone was done eating when we got our replacement dish which was super awkward when everyone stare at you eating your food.  The beer is the best part of the night. Over 150 types to pick from!! How can you go wrong"}
{"text":"Best, and most friendly staff ever!!! Loved the hostesses, they were so sweet. Ordered the Chef Special Pancetta. It was divine!!! Thick, juicy, packed with flavour. I inhaled all of it till I was bursting, I couldn't stop eating it."}
{"text":"30 pages beer menu + good food (really good, not just the kind you get in every bar). What else do you need?"}
{"text":"I've never experienced such slow service before. I'm not sure why this location was so under staffed - in the lower part of the place - but not only was it under staffed, the waitress working was fairly rude. 

I'm not saying this place wasn't serving us, but with the whole place getting faster service than us - especially with newer people arriving and getting better service - it felt like because we didn't look like everyone else (us coming from a 8km run to watch the basketball game), our service didn't matter. When in reality the three of us are VPs and directors at high profile companies. It's amazing that looks can determine how you are being served.

Food is average.
Service is sub-par
I leave it up to you to decide if you want"}
{"text":"If you're looking for bar food and a massively extensive list of beers in Montreal then Bier Markt is your place.

I got the Fish Frites which are panko-crusted fillets of sole, r√©moulade, Markt frites. This was Very good, but I tried some of my buddy's meal and his was off the charts.

You HAVE to get the Smoked Ham Croque
- Central Frontenac ham, aged white Cheddar, Rodenbach Flanders Red Grand Cru poached pear, honey Dijon aioli, grilled bistro bread, Mornay fondue

The only drawback to this place is price. If they were a bit cheaper I would have given Bier Markt 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been there twice for hockey games.TV screens are so so . The first time it was overcrowded you have to give your phone number to the hostess then you will get a text letting you know that a table is ready for you. Meantime you can hangout at the bar so you can spend a bit more discovering new drinks. You have a very wide range of beers and different drinks . I had a beer from Belgium which cost around 15$ . It was very good. Also the food is tasty . it's on the pricey side but worth trying .The service is great  I can't complain ."}
{"text":"Have you ever had the feeling of being confronted by so much selection that you feel as if your brain just my overload and go into the pc blue screen mode? I call this the first time Costco effect, and it's what can happen on one of your first visits to the bier market. 

Without an experienced friend OR a kick ass tour guide (waiter) the esplanade experience can make one want to go cross eyed. Luckily for a first timer friend the other night she lucked out and had the best of both worlds. 

Meeting for dinner and drinks in the city recently we decided to venture to this drafty location (gratuitous beer pun). As per the usual in my experience the restaurant was like that of a bee hive: noisy and bustling with activity (even at 8pm on a Tuesday). Despite the crowds we were seated swiftly and presented with THE MENUS. I capitalize that because there are two (for those whom have never visited) 1 for food and the other (a coil bound notebook) for the beer list - GREAT MERCIFUL CRAFT (beer). 

I noticed my friend about to overload and shut down just as our waiter came to her rescue. He introduced himself and took us on a verbal journey of explaining the menu, venue, beer specials and their relevant food pairing suggestions, so eloquent and well rehearsed I felt as if I was listening to a presidential inauguration speech. 

During the magic that was his Beerly spoken word he described the two beer specials with such accuracy and beauty that my friend and I immediately ordered 1 each. For myself I had the \"toffee flavored with mild hints of coffee\" Leffe. And my friend enjoyed the Hertog Jan pilsner which \"tastes like Heineken without the skunky after taste\". 

Upon taking a first sip of my own brew I was shocked at how smooth this beer was and with no after taste. So much so that my sip lasted about 2/3s of the way down my glass (oops). 

Once I resurfaces from my deep pint exploration we decided to order some food. We decided on the cheese Fondue (served with apples, bread , and potato) to share as an appetizer. Following we each decided on the Belgian chopped salad (hers with chicken mine with salmon). 

The fondue arrived shortly with all that was promised and the molten formage was ohhh sooo oohhhhyy goooeyyy that all conversation ceased as we dunked in time after time. It was a good thing that our server warned us about the extreme temperature of the clay fondue pot as there were one or two times where I felt inclined to pick it up and drink straight from it. Not classy I'm aware but YOLO. Ha ha ha. 

Following the beer and cheese I was satisfied and could have left a happy boy but alas the salads were still to come. I say alas because although they were very creative in their presentation and ingredient selection I did feel like this salad lacked any sort of oomph. In fact if it wasn't for the very well (albeit small) cooked piece of salmon this salad may have been a complete failure. 

However, salad aside this was over all a remarkable dining experience. Our server was top shelf and his attention to detail and service was expert. When the bill came we expected it to be high (especially when the salads cost $19 a piece). But we didn't mind and I made sure out waiter was tipped handsomely. 

I'm eager to return to the bier market to begin making my way through their beer menu until I am sloshed to the PINT of no return

** YOLO = you only live once (for those not up to current pop lingo) lol

** LOL = laughing out loud (ha ha sorry)"}
{"text":"Twice here but never again, the only good thing about this place is the decoration and setup. Pricy for nothing"}
{"text":"A fun night out.  Loved the decor and ambiance and the had a great band playing a set.   A few friends and I just wanted a little snack and decided to try this place out.  can't say the food was great but the drinks were good and service wasn't bad considering it was packed.  I was charged extra on my bill for some reason bit didn't argue as it was a few bucks and I had to go but do keep an eye on your bills incase this is the norm."}
{"text":"Please stick to beer only at the Bier markt...  Food was horrible...  not to mentioned overpriced.  Chicken wings were overcooked and stiff...   steak was well... same...  We ordered medium rare and got well done....  flavour of beef was good though (which tells you that the quality of meat used was good, but they can't cook it properly)  Sausage flatbread was not cooked all the way through....    My friend ordered oysters and they were fine.  

Not to mention that the server was rude and unprofessional...  even to my friend who was the birthday girl.  

Avoid this place if possible, there are much better options.  If you want beer, go to the LCBO."}
{"text":"The ambiance was nice, a bit too loud for my taste. The beer selection was definitly huge and I had a beer I used to drink in Germany, it was unfortunatly very expensive... 9$ for a beer that in Berlin is 2¬Ä. 

The food was good but not impressive, we had the crab dip, the mini sliders, the fried calamari and a poutine. The crab dip was our favorite!! We did have to ask for more pita chips because they bring very little with it.

Overall it was a nice night, but a very average experience. I would not really go there again.

________________________________

L'ambiance √©tait bien, la musique √©tait un peu trop forte pour moi par exemple. La s√©lection de bi√®re est d√©finitivement √©norme. J'ai pris une bi√®re que je buvais tout le temps en Allemagne mais elle √©tait tr√®s ch√®re... 9$ pour un bi√®re qui √† Berlin co√ªte 2¬Ä.

La nouriture √©tait bonne, mais pas excellente. La trempette au crabe √©tait tr√®s bonne par exemple, on a beaucoup aim√©, mais il a fallu demander plus de chips de tortilla parceque il n'y en avait pas assez.

C'etait une belle soir√©e mais une exp√©rience tr√®s moyenne en fait. Je ne pense vraiment pas retourner."}
{"text":"3 stars for selection of beer.
food? HA. just simply over priced. I've had better food for better price. but that's the price I have to pay to be in a bit-some what-pretentious place I guess. I just go there for couple european beer and that's it. Dining experience was so-so."}
{"text":"Built a good dinner menu just from the appetizer menu and salads. Pretzel calamari is tasty and the crab dip is especially delicious. Only down side is the noise level of the restaurant. I thought it would be slightly less noisy on a non-game night. A little bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Visited this place with my wife after I have take shopping. Had to wait about 30 minutes but it was not a problem since Pandora was right around the corner. Ended up buying 2 charms for my wife while we waited for a seat. This dinner was costing me before I even sat down.  We got a dining room seat, not a big place so a wait time of 30 minutes is not uncommon. Wide selection of beer and wine. My wife and I decided to just order apps and share, since it was our first visit we wanted to try as much as we can. Ordered the calamari, poutine, sliders and the meat plate. The apps were delicious and have good portions to share amongst a table of 4-5 I would say. The calamari would be my favourite out of the apps we order. We ordered dessert, the chocolate waffle ice cream....... Don't have say much except.... YOLO. Prices are competitive with the Jack Astor's and Joey's in the same vicinity but they make everything fresh and not frozen prefab. I would definitely come back again, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"I came here with a colleague of mine who was visiting Toronto. I've enjoyed it in the past and thought this would be a good location. As always the selection of beer was great. For an appetizer we had poutine which was good but expensive for what we got. For our main meal, we had fish and chips. Unfortunately, the fish was overcooked and the batter too thick and verging on burnt."}
{"text":"I feel for what I ordered - I could've made it myself; therefore, that deserves a 3 - however, the service that night (presumably because we went on a Monday night, it wasn't as busy) was exceptional. We had a total of 2 people helping us who were both very friendly and helpful all the way through, constantly refilling our waters and asking if we were doing okay.

We ordered a Charcuterie board and decided to get all nine for $39 which made for an excellent choice because between 2 people - we were willing to eat the entire thing although we fully could've made this at home but the amount of meat was great. We loved the smoked bacon and the prosciutto it was amazing! We also ordered the baked pot - a soft cheese with lingonberry jam and roasted pecans - it also came with a side of pickled veggies and crisp green apples and went well together. I didn't enjoy the pickled veggies so much. For dessert, we ordered creme brulee which had a puff of what seemed like marshmellow on top and underneath had a lemon-y taste which I actually liked. On the side it came with some raspberry macarons and I ate every bit of it. Yum!

On top of that, as aforementioned, our waitress was great! I got her name but forgot it (very sorry) but she had a bunch of circle band tattoos going around her left arm I think?? She had light brown hair? Forgot her name but she was great, alongside this other waiter - not sure if he was part of management but he was wearing a pink dress shirt... and had blond hair. Anyway both worked well that night and am happy our service wasn't horrible! Will definitely come back for this fact!"}
{"text":"This place does not do the Bier Market name justice.  

I can in on a relatively busy Saturday night.  My brother and I ordered fondue and sirloin steaks.  (Excellent beer selection.  If you can't find a beer you like here, it's on you!)

The fondue showed up and it tasted great.  The flame went out in the heat source and took about 15 min to find someone who could light it.  The cheese congealed.  When they re-lit the fondue, it was way too hot and quickly turned the remaining cheese into a solid brick of burnt cheddar.  That being said, the smell was incredible.  

After a 32 min intermission between fondue and the main course, our steaks arrived.  This was a real shame, because it was a decent piece of meat... Cooked poorly, then allowed to cool thoroughly; before being garnished with frozen garlic butter and served on a cold plate.  The butter was just gross.  The waitress (who was very nice, but not really someone who did anything more than run food) did offer to take out chunks of frozen butter and microwave them.  My only regret is no asking her to bring me a plate of melted butter.  Also complete bullshit... $4 up charge for mashed potatoes versus shitty fries.  

Dinner was complete mess, but what really tied the experience together was having the manager twice mop slap me while I took a piss.  My shoes aren't fancy, but I don't need you to wipe your gross unclean bar floor on them. 

I'm a big fan of the Bier Market in the esplanade.  Franchises like this one will quickly destroy this reputation 



I can't leave a zero star rating .. Do this gets 1 by default"}
{"text":"Beer food pairing is the new thing and quite honestly we need more of. On one of my visits to Toronto I remarked that we needed more places that had a ridiculous variety of beer. Happily bier market opened up. Being a franchise, one can only expect so much. The waitresses are generally friendly, some more friendly then others but I prefer to focus on the experience, food and beer. 

The food for the most part has been good. The one issue I take with the food was a steak I had ordered that was tough and had a vein going through it. I'd stay away from the steaks but there are a lot of other options like he charcrut plate that's great everything. Their burger is solid and their sliders / hot dogs were nicely prepared. The schnitzel was also good but note it's strong on the capers.

The beer selection is great but I suggest looking at the pairings and try something new whenever you can. Even asking the wait staff for is good for ideas.

I'd definitely go back and recommend it as well."}
{"text":"I don't drink beer. {she doesn't drink beer? why would she...?}
all my beer drinking connoisseur-type friends LOVE this place, and thus, i find myself frequenting the Bier Markt more than you'd think.

i've been there to schmooz with friends during happy hour, birthday parties, and larger functions and i think the food is excellent. each \"brasserie\" menu item even has a few suggestions for beers that would go well with it. i mean, if i drank beer, what could be better than brasserie brunch waffles with beer!?

i always get their \"pot of moules\" and sop up the juicy goodness with \"markt frites\". seesh, who needs beer when you've got moules and frites!

not sure if the servers are being sympathetic to the fact that i, as a non-beer drinker, keep getting \"dragged\" to the bier markt, but they have always been really great at making suggestions for other alcohol options."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  We had a group of over 20 people and they were able to keep the service level pretty high.

I'm not a beer drinker, so I stuck with Caesars... They were very good!  
The pre-ordered appetizer plates that they brought out were good.  I liked the hot wings the best.  I ordered the bacon poutine and wasn't blown away though.  The gravy was just far too salty to really enjoy.

I'm sure we'll go back for work functions, and I'll be happy with that.  But it's probably not something that i will suggest."}
{"text":"Great beer menu. We had pub fare with it. 

The Bier Flights are a great way to experiment on what you want to drink - and are great to share. 

Burgers were really good - tastes like home-mad high quality meats.  Fries were great. My wife had the candied bacon poutine which was amazing. Gravy is exceptionally well done. Candied bacon has great flavour and adds to any dish. 

We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Had a fun afternoon enjoying some good beer on the patio with some cool Yelp friends. I intentionally skipped given some since I bad experiences at the Esplanade location.

This Don Mills location is not nearly as busy as downtown and they have a nice large patio in the front. They had a live band playing the patio this Sunday afternoon - a nice touch on a Sunny day.

Service was pretty good. Our server checked on us throughout the afternoon and ordering was fairly quick. They were celebrating Belgium's Birthday so there was lot's of free Stella and food samples.

The beer menu is extensive with well over 100+ beers organized by country of origin. I had the Grimbergen, Dieu du Ciel Rosee D'hibiscus, Blanche du Chambly and Hopf Helle. I really like that they have a number of good Quebec micro beers but would have liked to se more Ontario Micro brews. Safe to say, everyone can find something on the beer menu to enjoy.

Not really surprised about the mediocre food reviews here given my experience at other locations. We stuck with fries and the bavarian pretzels - hard to go wrong there.

I will stop by for a beer next time I'm in the area.

BK"}
{"text":"The ambience is good and the staff is polite too. I find it a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"This is more like 3.6 stars, but I rounded up because if they lowered their prices a bit it'd be fine.

Bier Markt has a bunch of Belgian and French foods such as moules and poutine and steak frites. They also offer fondue and the like. Two people in my party had the burger which they said was good. My sister had the steak frites, which she wolfed down (and this is a skinny 12 year old girl, not some large guy) and my dad had this Flander's Pie or something like that. Think a fancy chicken pot pie. I myself had the Markt Poutine, which is poutine with grilled chicken thrown in the mix. It was very gravy-covered, very cheesy and very tasty. Everyone enjoyed their meals.

The biggest selling point of Bier Markt is their vast beer selection, with more well known brands like Guinness as well as stranger brands like Old Speckled Hen. If you love good beer you won't be disappointed. If you prefer crappy stuff like Bud Light then you'll have to look elsewhere for your alcohol-tinged water fix (unless they just hid it really well).

Service was friendly, and the outdoor patio was clean and nice. Inside the decor was cool, but a tad too dark for my tastes. As stated at the start of the review, this place is just a bit too overpriced. If they slashed the prices of the meals then it would be great, but it's hard to justify paying 12 dollars for some fries and chicken covered in gravy and cheese curds."}
{"text":"Good beer, good food, need I say more? Not really. Honestly, this place is jamming with pretty good eats. If you haven't tried the homemade ice cream bars, then get ready for heaven!"}
{"text":"This is at least my 5th or 6th visit this week being back in town. Service is still great, our bartender/waitress was very friendly and helpful. Food wise maybe it was an off night but it seemed to have slipped a bit. The candied bacon poutine just wasn't as warm or as tasty as when we'd had it before. The flank steak I ordered was only ok, and kinda tough and chewy even for being med rare. The core beer selection is mostly the same but there are some newer things on it I got to try and those were all pretty awesome. Will definitely keep coming back as long as the food holds up, and even then I'd still come for the beers."}
{"text":"I've never written a review for a place but I have to do it for this one judging that the prices are higher than your average restaurant on top it was my birthday. The service was horrendously slow when it comes to the food. I can only assume they lack staff in the kitchen and in the dining room as our waitress, although has checked up on us several times which I thank her for, it still took her an unusual amount of time for her to get a refill on a drink and the bill. I would not recommend coming to this place unless you are able to wait approximately an hour for your food which even then is food that isn't anything special. 

Overall, the host and waitresses are nice as they did help me accommodate three more people as I only reserved a table for 5. Additionally, their policy was if you had 8 or more people, which I did,  it's an automatic 15% gratuity, this was not included which I'm assuming based on what we've been put through our waitress didn't add it in."}
{"text":"Strong International beer menu, average food with spotty service = 2.5 stars 

The beer menu is organized by Country or beer style. Mainly international selections with a couple of Canadian and U.S. craft beers thrown into the mix. Canada, Germany and Belgium are most represented (30 different countries represented in total) . The menu is easy to use for beer newbies and explains the different styles. They also have a few \"fruity\" beers if that's more your thing. 

Food has been hit or miss. They do a good charcuterie platter but I have not been a huge fan of their beer can chicken soup, Bavarian pretzels, steak frites or salads. The various beer poutine's are OK. 

Service has been mixed in my experience. They are generally understaffed on Sundays. I experienced some rude service at the end of the night - staff want you gone as fast as possible after last call, and they make it known to you! 

They have live music on weekends if that's your thing. I usually find that a major distraction if I want to sit back and enjoy beer with friends. You can't hear each other when a Band is playing.

I pop by for a beer every now and then when I'm in the area but never treat the Bier Mrkt as a destination. If you want International beer - go to the Town Crier. If you want craft beer - go to Barhop or Bar Volo.

BK"}
{"text":"Bad crowd !!!! Loud music, we couldnt even hear eachother !!!!!! The one at downtown is better!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok so the first 3 beers i asked for weren't available. No big deal.. what's up with the food menu though. Seriously, this is the best you could come up with? The prices are absurd as well. How much more pretentious can this place get.
A bier is a stand they usually wheel a casket around on; a corpse.  Somehow this place needs to get wheeled off the map. Nice decor isn't reason enough to save this review. I enjoyed my drinks, regardless of what they cost. Would I go back hellz no.. yea I'm the idiot that forgot his umbrella there.. but who's the employee that bussed the table then decided not keep it aside for me... I really doubt a customer walked away with a huge umbrella when it wasn't even raining anymore. Sad day at bier market. I was really hungry.  I really wanted this to be my new neighborhood go to spot for drinks and apps. You let me down guys."}
{"text":"Amazing patio (although on the queensway, so a bit noisy) if you're looking for different beers from all over. 
The food is pretty good too. Good for sharing.
The only reason it's a 4 is because the lines are pretty long sometimes to get a seat on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"We had a really good server who knew plenty about beer.  There's nothing worse than going to a place where the server knows nothing about their own product.  

For food, we snacked on the flight of poutine.  It was a decent amount to share between two people.  One poutine had smoked meat and pickles, the second was a beef poutine with mushrooms, and the third was candied bacon with sour cream and onions.  The cheese was not the traditional \"squeaky\" cheese, but the poutines were A-OK.  

The beer selection is quite impressive but I really don't know much about beer.  What I do know is when there are lipstick stains on my glass (which don't belong to me) it is gross.  I believe I did not get a new beer.  Instead, it was just poured from the dirty glass to a new glass.  Still gross.  

3 stars for poutine.  5 stars for the abundance of beers. 1 star for the gross glass and (likely) re-pour."}
{"text":"My first visit to this location was okay. 

I visited for brunch -- the portions were a good size, and the staff were fine when my group needed to my substitutions for certain items. I will say that I was disappointed to find out that there was a brie cheesecake on the menu (which came highly recommended by a friend of mine) that has since been taken off the menu. I have to confess that her praise was the main reason we visited. 

Nonetheless, we had a good time. There was also a live band playing during our visit; from our seats we could only hear them, but we couldn't see them at all. 

For brunch, I had the Belgian Breakfast: sausage, bacon, eggs, toast, backed beans and fries. It sounds like more than it is because I literally got 1 sausage, 1 piece of bacon, 1 slice of bread, 2 eggs, a small container of beans and a good sized portion of fries. The beans were a little crunchy (sorry to say), but the toast was my favourite part of the entire dish. That's not a bad thing; it was very very good bread!! 

All in all, I had an okay time to a newest spot on the queensway."}
{"text":"My experience was okay, nothing great and I found it to be a little overrated. 

In early December 2012 I visited with friends for my birthday. We arrived around 10:30 or 11:00pm on a Saturday and the doorman wouldn't let us take in my birthday cupcakes but kept them at the door for me to pick up at the end of the night. There's some rule about not bringing in outside food, but I appreciated that he was friendly. Once inside, the staff were quick and a little harsh when trying to keep certain pathways and areas clear. I stopped walking when I was near coat check for less than a minute to take off my coat and was immediately told to keep moving.

Throughout the night there was a series of fights (oddly enough including the same people who probably should have been kicked out after the first fight) and the drinks (at least mine) were 80% ice. Other than that, the live band wasn't very good in terms of sound or musical range but they had good energy. Not sure if I'll be back anytime soon, but I hear brunch is amazing. Might give that a try."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday tonight. He had an area reserved right by the stage. The band that was playing was really good and took me back down memory lane with some songs by Maxi Priest. The food came out very fast. I got the short rib poutine. I really liked the fries a lot as they weren't too soggy or salty. I just felt that my food wasn't warm enough. It was a reasonable price, too. I'd still probably get it again. It was pretty quiet for a Saturday night but it was raining on and off all day. However there was a lot of people hanging around the complex. I was really upset that they took off the red stripe on their extensive beer menu. That's one of the only ones I drink and it's already hard to get at other places. Bring it back!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, especially in the summer time with the patio out front.  I always find the staff super friendly and cheerful.  They are also pretty quick to get you settled to a table and eating or drinking really fast.  Even on a Friday or weekend I find it's always quite easy to get a table at the restaurant or by the bar.

I prefer the bar with the TV's and the service seems a bit better over there as well.  The food is pretty good, but definitely not life changing.  I enjoy the seared tuna personally as it is light and well made.  I mostly come here for the beer though.  What a list they have too!  All the premium brands and lots of international brands I've never heard of as well.  They always have new specials on tap and it's a delight to try new samples that they have to offer. 

Definitely coming back here and it's much better to me, than Mill St. or the 3 Brewers."}
{"text":"So right after my friend's birthday party in Real Sports Bar, someone suggested we should get more drunk in another bar and someone recommended Bier Markt. I seriously cannot stress how dumb the name is and how hard to find this place on yelp. It's one of those slang that this generation would implement in the real world and it just sickens me, I don't even know how to pronounce it!

Anyways, since its a pub or whatever there was a bouncer dressed up in a classy dress shirt and attire that had one of my friends embarrassingly had to write his signature on a piece of paper although was kind enough to hold one of his birthday gifts in their \"office.\"

As other yelpers mentioned, I wasn't quite sure what this place is, my first impression was that of a pub that had a ton of beer/wine selections but the place was large that it could be divided into a bar, restaurant, club or a lounging area.  

We were seated in the booths that eventually got crowded although we were a party of seven. The selection of beers was quite impressive, I ordered a IPA and I really enjoyed it as the cute server (that almost looked like Natalie Portman) poured it. One of my friends suggested that the birthday boy gets the beer sampler and despite not being able to finish it. How the samplers were placed was somewhat hard to pull out but I tasted one and it was good. 

Again, being a mixture of everything, this place became louder as more people came  due to the fact that some \"band\" or whoever is making a racket on stage was so god damn awful that my ears began to hurt. The place literally screeches from time to time that it felt like we were next to the stage. Plus there were a bunch of rowdy middle aged woman that \"tried\" to flirt with me and was quite annoying as well. 

What makes it even more of a disappointing experience is that one of the bouncers, presumably the head bouncer came up to me and told me to show him my ID again, Just what the heck, I mean, I know that I look like I'm underage or something but having to flash my ID and having him glare at me is nerve wracking   and quite offensive. 

I will not come back to this place, as a gastropub/restaurant/screechfest with drunk middle aged women..."}
{"text":"Out with some friends at Don Mills, we grabbed a table at the Bier Market to have some appetizers. Don Mills is a busy place! I was happy we got a table! A big, bright venue with lots of windows and smiling faces....or maybe it's just the beer talking. 

The beer selection was staggering. I was glued to the menu trying to pick just one. They have every possible type of beer I could imagine and I wanted all of them! This is a great place to try something new and find a new favourite! 

We decided to share some appetizers. We went with the Fresh Oysters, Pretzel Calamari and Candied Bacon & Potato Flatbread. The oysters were fantastic. So fresh! It came with 3 sauces plus lots of lemons. A great start! The calamari had no pretzel taste what so ever. As far as calamari goes, it was pretty standard, but it had no remnants of pretzel. The flatbread was delightful. Who doesn't love candied bacon?! It was full of great toppings. Lots of bacon, creme fraiche and soft potato. It was surprisingly balanced. We were stuffed, but we did not leave one slice! 

The service was cheerful. Everyone seemed in good spirits and not rushed. Our server understood that there's a lot of choice and we never felt rushed. She checked on us periodically, but as it always goes, we had mouths full of food, so we could only nod in approval. Story of my life! :P 

I'd love to go back! There are so many beers left for me to try and many items on the menu looked so good! Can't wait to get together with some friends and revisit!"}
{"text":"Obviously good beer selection and tons of seating. I'd make a reservation if it's on a weekend or the night of a sporting event. 

If you're going to order a cocktail at a beer restaurant, make it a simple one. They do have a full bar, but may not have all the ingredients to make your fancy cocktail. It seemed to take forever when my friend ordered a Cosmo or don't bring a friend that drinks Cosmos. ;)

Food is decent. Burgers and flatbreads are always good. Good portions and pretty consistent."}
{"text":"Good things: location; great patio; easily accommodated our party of 9 without a reservation at 7:30 p.m. on a Monday; didn't mind that we moved from inside to the outside; were nice that we took up some of the aisle on the patio (non-purposeful douchey move on our part); big big selection of beer.  

I don't like beer.  I had the Strawberry Dak, a mix of rum, lime juice and Fruili beer (strawberry).  $6.60.  It was good, quite good.  (still beer)

Service was present but kind of half-hearted.  They didn't bring us waters or anything; they took a long time to come around every time we got a new member added to our group.  Inside, the female server kept making mistakes and almost seemed like it was her first day?  Somehow she seemed quite frazzled.

Good hangout but not a real destiniaton spot."}
{"text":"I always have trouble quantifying my reviews with stars. It's all relative, right? If it wasn't, how can I justify giving Sneaky Dees, King's Cafe, and Bier Markt all 4 stars? Well, you gotta know what you're comparing it to.

Honestly, I don't love the vibe of places like the Bier Markt but this place is a million times  better than similar King St. options and much better than it's Esplanade counterpart. 

The beer selection is top notch, incredibly varied, and always has at least three things I'm having trouble deciding between. 

The food, while pricey, is delicious.

A couple times they seem to be sampling beer and last time I discovered a great one! Only I drank so much of it that I have since forgotten what it's called. 

The Bier Markt's biggest downfall the few times I've been is the awful staff. The beers come fast but they're not very helpful. My friend asked for a good, very dark beer and they recommended Bass. Big warning bells went off. I recommended Leffe Brun, not the most adventurous recommendation, but, uh, it's actually a tasty dark beer. I was there with a rather large group recently (thanks [Boss's name] for treating us all to beer & food!) and the waitress kept insisting my table order something that I can't eat (I'm a vegetarian). My boss kept saying, no, X and Y (both vegetarian) will be just fine and the waitress turned to me and said \"Oh, it's just a little bit of bacon!\" and then later \"Are you really going to ruin everyone's night by not eating the lobster fondue?\". Excuse me? Yeah... not cool. (and for the record, I told my boss that as long as there was one thing I could eat, I'd be fine).

Still, when the food did come it was excellent and because I was with my kick ass group of co-workers I was able to ignore some of the more annoying client√®le. Go there knowing what kind of establishment it is and I think you'll leave there with your expectations surpassed."}
{"text":"Can't really decide if it wants to be a beer place, a restaurant or a club. Hence it does everything without a lack of focus. Came here this weekend but wanted more of a pub vibe. Band was hard rockers from the hammer. It seems like a decent bet if you want to pick up someone from condo land."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is good. The food and drinks are delicious. The restrooms are also very clean. 
My favorite is the strawberry fr√ºli and fish and frites. I'm so glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"Biermarkt provided great atmosphere, liveliness, and super friendly wait staff. Good oyster selection and some of the best mussels on this side of the Atlantic to pair with a diverse assortment of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Great beer options and service was so friendly and very fun environment. We came for an afternoon lunch our first stop in Toronto and was fabulous. The poutine and ABT chicken sandwich was delicious. 

Outdoor seating on a beautiful day, great service what a way to start a long weekend in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best deal for beer selection and sizing for sure. We had slow service on a slow day which was odd. I really like the food though so it's give and take here. A little pricey but doable. Service was just a little too lax, 2 star service the day we went, but in general it pretty good. It just felt like our server was avoiding  our table to flirt with another table of guys and she made direct eye contact with and avoided still. Wow. Food is good I like there schnitzel a lot it's flavourful and delicious."}
{"text":"I personally love this bar. From the large list of beers to the Platters of meats/pickles/pretzels. I'm a big fan of Belgium beer and find that the bier market has my favorite selections: the Krug and urthel."}
{"text":"We stopped in for brunch because their online menu mentioned something of a Poutine Benedict. However, the menu at the restaurant was much smaller and didn't include it. My boyfriend had the rosti Benny with porchetta and it was good. I had the Belgian Breakfast with eggs, English muffin, bacon sausage and frites. Mine was ok. The meat seemed not super fresh. Not spoiled but maybe a little dry. Caesars were good. I love the selections of beers. Service was good. A little canned, but efficient.

Overall just okay. I might come back. I might not."}
{"text":"Aside from the usual 1$ oysters I tried the burgers here -the Markt burger was pretty good with one patty and goat cheese instead of a second patty, I enjoyed the portion as it wasn't enormous and the side of of poutine (3$ extra)filled me up nicely. I had a beer flight with it for 14$, an assortment of blondes and stout-was a good choice for share between friends."}
{"text":"This is just what Mississauga needed.  Until this opened the only decent place to go for drinks was earls.  

I like the food at earls a bit better but they don't serve Stiegl,  my favourite beer. Bier Market has a great Collection of beers. It's a bit pricey but that kinda filters out the riffraff. 

Amazing patio and tons of parking.  The atmosphere is great,  outdoor TV's were perfect to watch soccer games in the summer. Go Germany! 

Ask for Jen to serve you,  very friendly and provides great service."}
{"text":"Great staff and great food! 
We came one afternoon, a party of 7, and it was pleasantly empty! The staff was great and we were seated right away. Each day has its own special. We order 3 flights of beer, two pizzas and one appetizer board. 

Must orders: bacon poutine, the 3 for $18 appetizer board (get the gouda bomb!)

Extra perks: if you sign up online, you get a coupon for 3 appetizers for free when you order $40 in food! And they also serve Birthday brownies!"}
{"text":"I LOVE BIER (Markt)! I have actually been here quite a few times, so was a little surprised that I had never checked in, or done a review!

Right in thick of a bunch of restaurants, it is one of the better and more unique options at Shops on Don Mills. Restaurant itself would be one of the smaller ones, but definitely one I prefer to go to and find myself visiting again and again. They have a bar area and a dining area, as well as a patio (albeit on the smaller side).

As the name would suggest, there is beer here. And when I say they have beer, they have almost any beer you could imagine. From hops, to blonds, to ciders, and even dessert beers, there is definitely some kind of beer you can find for yourself. If you aren't too sure what you would like or want to try something new, ask one of the servers or bartenders. They have tried most and can recommend something to your liking. Came by and wanted something different, and the bartender recommended a Hawaii beer that was actually quite awesome. There have been beers that I have been introduced to here that I enjoyed and had to get elsewhere too!

Food here is all over the place, which is actually a good thing for me as it can hit the spot for whatever you feel up for. The poutine was about the same as most other places, but gave you a good amount of gravy and cheese curds! The pretzel was about average, but definitely not the best I've had. The main dishes are quite good though, as they are usually created with beer pairings in mind. It really just depends on what you want and feel like at the time.

Definitely love coming her, mostly to try different beers that you've never had. They usually have some promotion going on as well, where you can try something new for a great price or for a combo. Absolutely worth checking out if you have never been and like the beers!"}
{"text":"Did you know that this Bier Markt resembles a club in the evenings? Neither did I, but it had an interesting change of pace than the Bier Markt's I have come to know. I had never been to this location before, but I was definitely surprised.

With loud music, dimmed lights, and a dance floor, it definitely gave off a club vibe. Luckily, they still had their entire beer selection open at the bar!

A fun place to hangout if you're looking for something later in the evening, but don't expect it to be like the 'restaurant' you've come to know."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late dinner while in town for some meetings. It was packed but found a spot at the bar. Terrific selection of beers and a big fan of creating your own flight of beers which didn't disappoint. I went with a mix of porters and IPAs and threw in a Cider to mix it up all of which were very good. For dinner I went with a sampler plate of Tuna Poke, Scallop Ceviche and Sausage. Well two out of the there were really good. I did not eat the Tuna as the fish did not seem fresh and the white rice it was served on was not cooked properly, stay away. The star of the evening was the Duck legs, WOW!! Fall off the bone good and the spice rub was great. If the Tuna was better I would have given a 5. I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Went there with a buddy of mine. Ordered a couple beers. The patio furniture was wet from the rain so we weren't able to sit outside at first. Later on we asked the waitress if we could sit outside at that time, she said \"you'll have to settle your bill and ask the hostess\" Why wasn't she able to ask for us?
We stayed inside and ordered a caesar pitcher called the Chacuterie Caesar which I've ordered before but this time only came with 3 sticks of meat/cheese. I advised her that it always came with four sticks before. She said this is by the book, it comes with 3. Instead of offering a fourth for me and my buddy, she said she can bring the book to show me that it only comes with 3. This thing was $30. I was so upset with her arrogance that we left the pitcher, paid, and left, vowing to never return."}
{"text":"At the end of my street so super convenient for me.

Of course, they have a great beer(bier?) selection from all over the world and I enjoy trying to taste every one. With this menu, there's a beer for every person even the ones who don't drink beer often.

Patio is always nice but also always busy especially in the summer.

Food is good, had (12)oysters and seared ahi tuna and both were great. But like most people have said, it's over priced. I think I paid $70 for both those plus a beer.

Overall, it's a place worth trying and a great place for the summer. It may be noisy there because it's usually busy but if you don't mind the noise and spending a little extra cash, this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"The one day the weather was better than usual on our trip to toronto so we really wanted to sit outside. Bier Markt has great outdoor seating and great beer selection. They didn't have my first choice of beer but the waitress was very knowledgable and suggested one that was similiar. She also poured my bf's beer perfectly it was quite impressive unfortunately it was not the beer he ordered but looked exactly like it so no biggie it was replaced quickly. We also were there during Woofstock (the all things dog street festival) and it was nice to have cute dogs hanging around the seating area."}
{"text":"If you just got off a plane and fought Customs and Immigration for 4.5 hrs, this would be the ideal place for you.  If you worked from 8pm to 6am right after that ordeal this place is for you.  I rolled out of bed the next morning across the street after a late checkout and rolled across the street to the Bier Markt.  Brain was fried after making decisions until the crack of dawn.  Came here twice.  

Day one: Charcuterie and the brisket poutine.  Charcuterie is perfect for snacking.  An excellent selection of four meats with delicious bread, and spreads.  The poutine with brisket mixed into it was a win in my book.  A brilliant idea.  

Day two:  A honkin juicy steak with frites.  I tore through that like it was my last meal on earth.  Cooked medium rare to perfection.  Just slipped down.  

Onto the beer!  They have a versed bible of beer from around the planet.  A number of Canadian and Belgian beer on tap.  Leffe dark is even better on draught.  Had a few good Canadian pils also.  Tackle the beer on tap if you do not feel like navigating through the book.

Our server the first day was great.  Ours on the second was even more rad!  She was the best!  It was my bday and she found me some cake :)  I would go back just to drink more beer with her.

These were expensive lunches.  If you come to snack and drink a ton with friends it should not be too bad."}
{"text":"Very nice here. Both times I've been here was at the patio for a few drinks.

Pastrami Poutine was delicious and smokey. I also tried their Markt Wings which were alright.

As for beer, one cant go wrong with any. My favourites are Stiegl (graphefruit tasting, light beer), and L√∂wenbr√§u (light German beer).

Inside and outside, the place looks nice and clean. The staff were nice and the decor was pretty fun and chill.

I'll definitely go back here again not only because of the food and drinks, but for the convenient location."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for a business dinner and hangout with the team. Great place to hangout and great beers. Atmosphere was relaxed and fun."}
{"text":"I had a horrendous time my first time here (pre-Yelp days) that would have warranted a 0 star rating...being seated, and then....nothing.  For 15 minutes.  We left.

But after hearing about the fondue festival, I decided to give it another try.  We had the chevre fondue, served with asparagus, grape tomatoes, and bread.  It was delicious!!!!  And complimentary bread refills, just so you get every drop of delicious cheesyness.

The steak Mediterranean salad was fantastic as well...a very large portion, and the steak was perfectly cooked.

Finally, the dessert fondue.  We decided on the  caramel toffee, since chocolate is a little more common.  It was served with ladyfingers, macarons, homemade marshmallows, banana and strawberries.  Oh...and chocolate chip biscotti that was still HOT!
IT WAS AMAZING.

I would  definitely come back here for a more special occasion.  A bit pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"I went to the Bier Markt last week because of their ads promoting the \"Fondue Festival\". Eager to finally try some fondue here in Toronto, I went there with great expectations, but they were definitely not fulfilled.

First of all, upon reading previous reviews here, I assumed they would harass us because of how we were dressing, but that was absolutely not the case. There were no bouncers at the time we went in (7:30pm) and when we entered we saw a lot of people dressed more casually than us - I went with regular shirt, pants and shoes and saw many people wearing t-shirts and sneakers with no problems.

The service was by far the best part. Although there were some longer-than-normal waits, the waitress was very nice and friendly.

Now, the food. Let me start with the greatest disappointment of the night: the fondue. We ordered the Brie, Lobster & Pastis Fondue. They sent us a pot filled with a pink cream and a little white cube in the center. That's weird, I thought... I had cheese fondue before and never was the cheese pink. Probably it's because they mixed it with the lobster cream. I tried and, not only I could not taste the cheese, the mixture was cold. They've chosen to heat the pot with a freaking candle instead of an alcohol burner. After 10 minutes trying to wait until the thing was hot, I decided to start eating it anyway. It was like a fancy mayo, nothing like fondue. After 10 more minutes I found out that the little white cube was the cheese! That's new. A cheese fondue with 1 tablespoon of actual cheese.

I wanted to try other fondues but after this screwup I decided to order the \"Surf & Turf\" fondue. This one was actually good, the lobster and the meat were tasty - but absolutely not worth the $49 that they cost.

The chocolate fondue at the end was actually the best food of the night, in terms of value. $15 was a good price for a good chocolate fondue. The fruit was fresh and the chocolate was delicious.

However, the overall feeling of that night was of a big trainwreck. \"OK\" food for out-of-this-world prices. I really wanted to give the other stuff a try, but the $125 that they ripped us off may have caused a permanent trauma."}
{"text":"Came in after a terrible Habs vs. Rangers loss, it's right across the street and super convenient. It is spacious and accommodating, the beer options are endless, which at times can get a little nerve-wrecking. The food was delicious, my friend and I ordered a few appetizers to share. Between the chicken wings, smoked meat poutine, and mini burgers, the first two were a hit and totally memorable! Now, on to the beers, what I really enjoyed was the 20$ beer tasting options. You can choose from European, Quebecois, and IPA, and you'll get 6 assorted beers with an indicator of where to start. It's a pretty great deal, I had the European and IPA, and enjoyed them thoroughly."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had in a long time. 

Upon arrival we were told there was a 30-40min wait, but we could sit in the bar lounge. The hostess walks into the bar area behind us providing zero direction. We ask if we can sit at a certain table, her response \"ya, I guess.\" A few moments later another staff member rushes over and says those tables are reserved and we can't sit there. Kindly asked him to find us somewhere else to sit then. We moved, no problem. 

No server in sight. Finally someone comes by, we ask for waters while we look over the drink menu and the dinner menu. No one comes back. We waited at least 20min. Finally one of the ladies at our table physically got up to go find our waitress. We give our drink order and food order at the same time. Thankfully a dining room table is now ready for us. 

I had the sangria. Eh, wouldn't get it again. It was nothing special. I got the Market Burger with cheese and a Caesar salad. The burger was horrible! It was over cooked and dry. The cheese was a cheese slice. A cheese slice! There were no condiments on the burger. None. No ketchup, mayo or mustard. The server didn't ask if I wanted any of these items either. The Caesar salad was made with a mix of romaine and field greens. The field greens were so incredibly soggy. Candied bacon was good though! I waited for 5-7min before I even started eating my meal, I wanted some condiments for my burger. Our server never came to the table. Again, had to go find someone myself. 

Our server came at the end of the meal to ask how it was. Little late to the game bud! We asked for our bills then. He comes back a few minutes later and says \"sorry, since you placed your order in the bar I have no idea what you guys got.\" For real?!

I was over this place before we even ordered and now it's for sure I will never return. Terrible food, even worse service. No thanks!"}
{"text":"Mediocre burgers, mediocre service. We probably won't be going back here, as there are better places to go for burgers and beer in the city."}
{"text":"If you like bland franchise food with the flavor of styrofoam this place is for you! Go for the extensive beer list and eat somewhere else. They do however have great service."}
{"text":"Je connais le Bier Markt √† Toronto. Je sais que le concept marche fort lorsque la routine est bien install√©e. Celui de Montr√©al est bien mais gagnera s√ªrement avec le temps. Int√©ressant choix de bi√®res, concept bi√®re/fromage int√©ressant.

Bon service."}
{"text":"I will give this place 3.5 starts. 

It is a very unique experince.  

Things i like:
Have a great selection of the beers. 
Have live music at night.
Thier mussuls are awsome! 

However, the rest of the food was okay. I tried their popular sausage dishes, but it didnt really impress me. Waitress was way to busy to take good care of every table. The seats were not too comfortable :( 

I think it is a good place to go at night if you would like to try out something differently. However, if you are looking for decent food. Then dont have too high expectation."}
{"text":"Hundreds of beers from all over the world. But, if you're not a beer drinker, like me, this place is still great. Try the beer cocktails -- super yummy. And, surprisingly, LOVE the Caesars -- the Canadian version of the Bloody Mary -- my new favorite drink."}
{"text":"Well to start... 


The BEER:
The selection is the best I have ever seen. The beer menu is actually a novel. I have been very impressed with their ability to keep such a diverse number of beers stocked and cold. And if you are feeling daring they even offer a number of Beer-Cocktails. (An interesting idea I never thought of.

The FOOD:
Check out the menu for yourself before you go. I however would say while the food is bad, it is too expensive and the selection is very lacking.  If I go to the Bier Markt it is not for the food.

The ATMOSPHERE:
Well, the music is usually very good, however it always seems to be too loud. I usually don't mind loud, but I have thought of wearing earplugs there. 
Apparently there is a dress-code in effect. And what a ridiculous one it is.  T-Shirts OK, Shorts not-OK. Honestly I don't get it. Also if you are going to enforce a dress code don't let your bouncer wear nylon cargo pants. (They aren't tactical uniform and its not fooling anyone)

Overall--- Not a bad place to go if you eat first, don't mind spending some extra money, and risking permanent hearing loss from the 700-800 Hz range."}
{"text":"We went there after a Habs game. They have an excellent assortment of beers. The beer cocktails are pretty great. I had the S'Wheat Citrus. The staff is knowledgable and super friendly. I had a great night with good people and even learned some Canadian history."}
{"text":"Stopped by on my first night in Montreal. Great beer, good food, friendly staff.  No complaints. Solid four stars!"}
{"text":"Went on the long weekend Sunday to watch the Jays game, and can I say it was great.

The large screen made it fun, the food was fantastic, and their burger a hit.

I would recommend the Wagyu burger and ask for extra Bier 52 sauce on the side for your fries. I promise you will not regret it.

The service was great, and overall a fun time"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Toronto, and I didn't even get to try the food! I wish I had time to eat here at least once though, because the menu looks fantastic...who could pass up Delirium mussels???

We came here for beers on 2 separate occasions and had some of the most fun of our entire trip, getting tipsy in one of the few establishments we found that served high quality beer. This was even more of a relief for us, as the other place we really wanted to try while in town, Beer Bistro, was closed for the duration of our 2 week stay. Luckily for us Bier Markt was just down the street from the Fairmont where we were staying.

The beer menu made it very easy to pick out which beers we wanted (I was hosting a large group of Germans, so their choice was obvious), and it lists not only country but the alcohol percentage as well, for those of us who like to indulge in the high gravity side of life. The one disappointment I had here is that on my second visit 3 of the beers I ordered were not in stock, and no indication was made on the menu, and the waitress had no idea until she went to check. If they are out of something, especially the best beers on the list, it should be better communicated to the staff.

I did have a few beers for the very first time here, something which is rare for someone who has tasted as many things as I possibly can when it comes to the beer world. One of them was actually recommended by the waiter on my first visit, the Hoegaarden Grand Cru (a 9.5% big brother to the familiar beer, included in my photos!), and it was absolutely fantastic. Typically I prefer things on the darker scale, but I could drink this gem of a wheat brew all night (although I wouldn't want to pay for it at the end).

I highly recommend this place to anyone in town for a few nights, or even to the people who live in the area, as there was no where else I found that matched the quantity and quality of great libations in Toronto. I really appreciate the places that pour beers in the glasses they belong to, it's a rare thing, but once you have it the proper way you never want to go back!"}
{"text":"i love the food & the service here...but i am NOT a fan of super loud places unless im in a place like Real Sports. great if you're here with friends, but not if you're thinking of enjoying a date night."}
{"text":"Huitres √† 1$ du lundi au jeudi de 17h √† 20h, yaaaaaay! J'adore les huitres fra√Æches, et le \"cinq √† huitres\" fait mon bonheur.

Il y a toute sorte de gens qui viennent partager un moment ici, des tables hautes, des banquettes, √ßa a beaucoup de cachet. Dommage qu'il soit SI DIFFICILE de trouver des places de stationnement assez proches..."}
{"text":"Beer is the only reason I come here, obv not a surprise. Nothing outstanding on the menu Ive tried thus far. Make sure you make resv on the wknds otherwise expect to wait for at least an hour. Patio faces the busy Queenways accross from Sherway Gardens. Great if youre in and out for lunch during the cooler Summer days."}
{"text":"I'm a beer over liqueur girl so you can imagine the only reason I'd ever visit the Bier Markt is for the  obvious. Loads of choices and best of all they've got 4 choices of sampler flights, which allow you to try 6 different good size samples of beer. Sweet and Sour were all good with the exception for one which tasted more like red wine. With Frulli and Somsersby being two of the six, there's no reason not to enjoy these samplers. Pastrami poutine is honestly the best thing on the menu to me, seeing as they have such limited reasonably priced choices. Everything main course is well over $23 dollars including the burger which I find ridiculous. The mussels are a very good size at $21 it came with a good bowl of perfectly seasoned frites and three different dips (curry mustard, honey dijon, ketchup) and a good size bowl of mussels. Overall, food is okay honestly way overpriced in my opinion, great if you are here for the beer. FYI, who knew you could order a whole roasted pig at the Bier Markt?? All you gotta do is order 48hrs ahead lol."}
{"text":"Went on a Tue. night and there was no band/DJ/ scene as others described, just a post-work crowd enjoying a sunny summer evening.   
If you like good Euro beers, this is a nice place to enjoy them.  I thought my veal schnitzel dish was decent, though a little heavy for my tastes (a tad coarse/well cooked) but I rarely have this dish so I'm not exactly sure if that's the way most schnitzels are served.   Otherwise the sauces, sides and desserts all were good, and my companions enjoyed their mussels and fondue.  I'd probably normally give this a 3, but with their big patio and perfect beer drinking weather, they get a +1."}
{"text":"My friend was lured in by their promise of a cheese fondue so we hit this place up.

The three of us ended up splitting a dinner of appetizers: the cheese fondue (for them, not me), a pound of mussels Alsatian and a charcuterie plate. 

Everything was delicious. They really enjoyed the cheese fondue and I really enjoyed everything else. The grilled bread with the charcuterie was fantastic, as well as the dipping sauces. 

Service was friendly and professional and the place had a real yuppie-after-work vibe to it, which is not my usual type of place, but it was nice."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and live band on Friday night. Lots of drink options. Waitress was a little slow though."}
{"text":"Very tasty French food.  Good selection of beer and amazing malpeque oysters at $1 each."}
{"text":"This is such a fun spot to start the night! Went with a group of 5 and sat at the bar. They have flights for $16 and doesn't matter how much the glass is(or great way to try expensive wines). Music starts probably around 8. A bachelorette party was dancing on the dance floor. But it's still chill. 

Food is delicious too - definitely try the duck wings. It's an appetizer but certainly an entree portion. Staff is so lovely too. A friend fell ill and staff were super helpful the entire time. 


Definitely rsvp or get early if you can."}
{"text":"Love this place. This place just happens to reside next to our hotel. Lots of beers on tap. Tons of bottled beers. The beer menu gives you an extensive description of beers. Food wise.  We only tried the charcuterie plate. While it was good.  It probably wasn't the best cured meats I've tasted.  Solid. But just not mind blowing amazing.  The beers we tried were really good.  Being in Canada. I stuck with mostly Canadian beers and all of them were really really good. Service was great. Waitress was super friendly and accommodating to our large group of rowdy guys."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy this place.  Pretty good food, nice selection of drinks, varieties of beer and wine.
and verrrry courteous service.
make a reservation if you want dinner, or just call ahead to see how long the wait is.  but even if you have to wait there is a nice bar that is just as enjoyable to sit around and wait for your table.  There are a number of people loitering by the bar while the other half sits and eats and that scnene continues all night long.  Great for late night dinner and drinks before you go out for later night things.

the selection of food and drninks isnt' AS good as beer bistro, but it is still good and typically priced for the area and type of establishment.

good music, not modern stuff, just nicely done covers of top 40s stuff that you will appreciate of you are anywhere from 25-40.  the age range in that place hovers around there too."}
{"text":"It's very similar to the esplanade location, but much smaller. Basically, a good selection of beer, nice tasty food if a little on the expensive side. They often have some free sampling beers and mussels on weeknights, which helps. Service tends to be good, but a little slow. The atmosphere is nice enough, and having a patio helps if the weather's good.

Parking at Shops by Don Mills is always a bit of a pain -- you won't be able to get near the place, so you have a walk ahead of you. Assuming you can live with that, the Bier Markt is a nice place for a couple of good beers and a somewhat pricey bite to eat."}
{"text":"Granted the weather was gorgeous but for a Monday evening the patio was packed!

Our waitress was so knowledgeable about all the beers we could have quizzed her and I bet she would have gotten an A! 

Great time, nice atmosphere, trendy but not snobby-fun time!"}
{"text":"The food was really yummy! It was a little salty but still good. I got the pork schnitzel and markt salad, both were tasty. 
Unfortunately, the service was AWFUL. 
My group ordered a plate of cheeses and such to share, and we literally never got our order. When we asked our waitress, she said, 'wait they never gave it to you?' 
Our waitress forgot to take 2/8 of the orders, I had to chase after her to give her my order. When food arrived, the servers were rude, handing plates to people without asking who ordered what, and just generally having a horrible attitude.
I work in the service industry and I understand that sometimes customers are rude or servers aren't having a good day, but honestly... the service was consistently bad. My waitress told us she was new, which is of course understandable, but everyone else was awful too. LOL. We tried to be understanding, but mistake after mistake is a bit tiring.
The food was good. Would recommend this place to people wanting to have fun at night with friends, but maybe don't have high expectations in terms of customer service. 

I'll still go back for sure! I want to try those cheeses I never got ;)"}
{"text":"I fell in love with the inside decor when I walked into this restaurant, vintage and styling. Although it is a very beautiful evening, we choose to stay inside. With a reservation I got a window seat lucky ~next time if I'll definitely try the nice patio.

This is my first time to Bier Market . I was surprised by the big variety of their beer options. We  are all not familiar with those so we choose the first one on Bier Flight. This is a set of six different beers and for three of us is just perfect. From #1 to #6 the taste is from light to dark according to the colour as well.#3 is my favourite with a lovely fruit aroma (grape? maybe)and taste .

Yes we are here for the cheese fondue and I wanna give a very high point for their Swiss Grande Fondue. I like the great texture of the Swiss cheese and a little bit herbal taste makes this fondue outstanding.

We also order another must try dish PEI Mussel Bucket which is fresh and tasty. I'll recommend the snitzel, with very good portion and great sauces. On Thursday Flatbread is the daily special and only $10. 
The bacon flatbread comes with a strong smoky flavour. The crust is thin and crunchy.

In a word, very good place to hang out with friends or watch a game while having some great beer to drink."}
{"text":"I ordered the ahi tuna meal and they were kind enough to allow me to switch the potatoes for a rice and lentil pilaf. However, the ahi tuna was grossly overcooked. I have never been served \"seared\" ahi tuna that was medium-well before but it was very bland and flavorless. Also, it is possible the sauce was lost in the rice but there was minimal flavor from the sauce.

If you want the tuna, or the tuna burger specify RARE.. if that is what you want."}
{"text":"La bouffe boff...peut-√™tre car nous √©tions plus que vingt que toutes les frites √©taient froides? Bref, nous n'avons pas tripper sur la bouffe...

Par contre, niveau ambiance, choix de bi√®re et service...rien √† dire...endroit magnifique :)"}
{"text":"[4/5] Location: conveniently located in the heart of Mississauga in the Square One area. Good place to stop off at after a shopping trip to Square One or after works for drinks with your colleagues.

[3/5] food: the food was just average, nothing to write home about. Pricey for the quality/portion size given. If you are looking for a light meals, try the mussels!

[2/5] Service: the service was below average. It took very long to get our food and drinks (+30 minutes). The servers also forgot about our drink orders..."}
{"text":"Shop at Don Mills location.
Patio was nice. Enjoying all the exotic cars driving by while you try different types of beer.

Only wish the staff were trained a little bit about their beer menu since it's their primery category.

When asked for a recommendation she had no clue.

Bier Can Chicken flatbread was decent for a bar. 
Will visit again"}
{"text":"This place was super fun. Great food, huge beer selection and great ambiance."}
{"text":"a very nice place with a stage for live music and dance floor in front.
a bit too loud and we had to raise our voices to talk to each other. 

the food selection is not bad but too limited for vegetarians... a mushroom soup ($7) a flatbread+goat cheese+sundried tomatoes ($13) some salads and fondues. 
talking about fondues. My friend ordered one I think it was cheddar cheese with mustard dip snacks (bread/apple/sausage). for some reason the foundue was not flavorful enough and as a result not very satisfying. same with flatbread with chicken and brie cheese. 

beer/wine selection is amazing! and they have a pairing suggestion to each dish on the menu. which is very helpful. 

the staff is very friendly and the waiter we got (John) was fantastic. His energy virtually pumped us up=) 

that's a nice place to come on a summer when they have patios outside right on a quite esplanade str.

TIP: they don't accept debit cards."}
{"text":"MAPLE COATED !!! What!? Best salad I have ever tasted with the maple crusted bacon!  HUGE selection of beers from around the world and lots of the great ones on tap like pilsner urquell.  Service was friendly and the place was packed.  DJ music was great but they should take some of the profits from the beer and use it for a better band."}
{"text":"Not good at all. 

Went last night only because my friends were already there. Obnoxious lineup outside starting at 10:30 (what the hell??) but civil bouncers.

Won't comment too much on the crowd because I don't think it's relevant. Seemed like 25-35, young professionals it looked like.

There was a deeply mediocre cover band playing far, far too loud. In the first set I observed, the singer used the word \"fa**ot,\" and then in the second set, said the \"support from you guys is ridiculous, I creamed in my pants.\"

Very classy. Nice choice.

I gave a very, very busy bartender my credit card to open a tab after waiting for quite a long time. I was thinking of having only one drink, so ordered a relatively expensive glass of scotch. About $15. I asked her to add \"a tiny, tiny drop of water please,\" to open it up and stood by horrified as she poured the shot and then added another full ounce of water from her gun.

She put it on the bar and I informed her that when someone orders an expensive scotch with a drop of water in it, they mean literally, a drop of water. She told me, \"I pushed the gun once, what do you want me to do.\" I waited for her offer to pour me another, as she had completely ruined the scotch, but she simply pushed it towards me and walked away.

This is a completely unacceptable lack of expertise from a \"bartender,\" and the Bier Markt should be embarrassed."}
{"text":"I haven't been to The Esplanade in a long time. (The Esplanade, by the way is the name of the street where you'll find the Bier Markt, and it is also, notably the name of this little trendy village). Located just south of Front Street, within walking distance of Union Station and Yonge Street, The Bier Markt is a very large and multi-purpose restaurant that is known for it's many beers and live music.

 I haven't been in a long time because the Bier Markt, while impressive for the world-array of beers, ales, and lagers, isn't anything to really travel your way out-of to go to. It's ok; it's clean and nice inside. The music is usually a good live band that brings the crowd on to the dance floor at night. But, that's about it. I felt it was like a pick-up bar and that whole scene is pretty tired.

 I would recommend going to the Bier Markt for their beers. It's fun to try something you've never had before, and for that reason alone, the Bier Markt is a neat place to go with a group of friends and have a drink fest."}

{"text":"Went to Bier Markt on a Friday night for a birthday celebration - dinner and drinks. I reserved a table for 10 a couple days before, calling in and reserving was simple and easy. I also let them know we would be bringing in our own cake - Note: if you're bringing in your own birthday cake, there is a minimal charge for that. Also, if you want them to cut and plate it, there's a small charge for that as well. 

On the day of the event, Bier Markt called to confirm my reservation which was a nice touch. 

Once arrived, we were shown to our seats. The beer menu was expansive, and as a beer drinker, it was great to have so much choice. Their 7oz, 6 drink beer flights are nice, but wish you could choose the beer you wanted in the flights. 

The menu is your bar/pub food - some nice dishes, but burgers, sandwiches and steak frites some of the most popular on the menu. We started with the crab dip which was delicious. Then the steak frites for dinner - steak was cooked well and the frites were delicious. 

As for the service, our waitress Pam was on great throughout the night. We were there from 8pm to 1am, and throughout that entire time, she ensured we had everything we needed -- thank you Pam!

Music started around 930-10pm, they had a DJ and a band. The DJ was great and kept the vibe up and people moving (at least nodding their heads). However the band I felt was much less engaging. Music is personal preference, but I felt the type of songs chosen to play were either too slow, not engaging enough, and not as fun for a Friday night. 

Overall I would definitely visit Bier Markt again, more for drinks and apps, hope I would get the same service and hope that the DJ plays a lot more than the band."}
{"text":"Bier Markt has quickly become the official watering hole of my office. It's a great place for large get-togethers, whether for celebrating someone's birthday or just for a fun Friday night. It's got a great vibe and offers a beer menu that has something to satisfy everyone's tastes. On Friday nights they usually have a live band performing. It can get really loud and packed, but that just shows how popular this bar has become in the short time that it has been open. The food is alright. The poutine is average, and the pizza (deceptively labelled as \"flat breads\" on the menu) is pretty good, but I find the food very overpriced. $13 for french fries, gravy, and a couple of cheese curds is a bit ridiculous, if you ask me. The drinks are pretty pricey too ($7+ for beer). You're paying a premium for ambiance. They've also got a small patio area that's sure to be popular in the summer. Bier Markt is definitely worth checking out - just come prepared with a few extra dollars in your wallet."}
{"text":"This place was really good!  I've had bad experiences at beer gardens- they are usually loud, noisy hipster hangouts with bad food and poor service.  This place was NOT that. I was surprised at the quality of the food, given the crowds and the size.  And yes, it was a bit loud, but service was very good.  Mussels and fries were delicious and very fresh, as was the ahi tuna burger.  The fried gouda cheese appetizer was delicious.  So was the donut dessert.  The price tag was a bit high, but I never mind paying a little more when I leave happy with the food and service.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite casual drink places around town. these guys have a large selection of bier, almost daily specials, and is decorated fairly nicely. On Friday night there is almost always a live band playing thus it won't be a quiet night. if you are planning to eat in the dining room on the weekend during meal hours, make a reservation, you might be waiting a while, but most of the time you can find a spot at the bar to grab a drink."}
{"text":"This was the first time I came to this location.  I came here with a pretty big group and our server Katie was extremely personable, professional, and most importantly laughed at our amazing jokes!  The food tasted wonderful and came out really quickly.  I ordered the Vitagreena salad with a Medium Rare steak and it was made to perfection......and yes...you cant make friends with Salad BUT you can definitely make friends with BEER!!! 

I ordered the Delirium Tremons which is a strong beer with alcoholic content of 8.5%.  This beer tasted light and refreshing and paired well with my salad.  The vodka, jagermeister, tequilla, and gladitor shots all came out quick and with a smile.

A huge bonus on Saturday night is that they had live music and the band that was playing played some great music! They took requests and played current songs as well!  A very nice touch and great way to end our night at Biermarket!  

However, as with all shops on Don Mills...bring your wallet as these prices are not your typical chinatown prices.  There is a reason why all you mostly see there are Benzos, Lexus', and Beemers."}
{"text":"The food was actually really bad last night. Another table in front of us was also having a lot of problems with their food - really bad schnitzel apparently.

The $25 Wagyu beef Merchant burger was really dry and tasteless. Super underwhelming for what it claims to be. The $17 Fish & Frites came with cold, soggy fries (I've never had that experience before) and the breaded cod, thankfully warm, tasted like the frozen fish you'd buy from the grocery store. The $7 Waffle Ice Cream Sandwich was actually the only tasty and enjoyable item I had last night - with just average, whatever vanilla ice cream, but a warm, brownie-like thin chocolate waffle. 

With a pint, the meal came out to $75, including tip. Was really a waste of a lot of money, for actual bad-tasting food. So strange. I wouldn't recommend coming here at all."}
{"text":"Came here after work one day with a couples of co-workers.  The place was pretty busy and lively for a Tuesday night.  We walked in with reservations and were seated right away.  It was too bad that the weather wasn't as nice because they do have a nice patio area with umbrellas.  I thought that the restaurant could have used a bit more lighting as we all had a hard time trying to pick a beer to start off with because we couldn't see much.  Might I add that the beer menu that they provide is like a booklet with all different types of selections of beer.  There was Pale Ale, Amber Ales, Ciders, Beer Cocktails and many many more.  Not only was there a Bible of Beers but they had daily specials for food and drinks depending on the day that you visit.  The waitress that helpful with suggestions to beers that may have appealed to our likings and very accommodating.  She offered to take our orders for drinks before everyone got seated but everyone was so indecisive about what they wanted.  I finally decided to order a Palm Speciale (Pale Ale) along with a Beef and Cheddar Poutine (24-hour Leffe Brune Abbey Ale-braised beef, aged white Cheddar, roasted mushrooms, Markt frites, pan gravy) and their Dunkel Duck Wings to share with the boyfriend.  We devoured the Beef and Cheddar Poutine (must-try deliciousness) and the Duck Wings (slow-braised duck drumettes, fried crisp, dry spice-rubbed, gold BBQ and hot lingonberry dipping sauces) were not too bad, although the boyfriend wasn't as much of a fan as I would.  He described them to be a little on the dry side since he likes his duck meat to be fatty.  My co-workers ordered the Pretzel Calamari (pretzel-crusted, fried crisp, harissa aioli, house-made r√©moulade, fresh lemon - which I thought tasted like regular battered calamari), the Classic Poutine (Qu√©bec cheese curds, Markt frites, pan gravy ) and their Markt Wings (in Butter, Salt and Pepper).  The second round of beers, I decided to go with one of my favourites, Delirium, but sadly, they sold out of it and I got a Ceres instead (which was supposed to be similar to the taste of Delirium).  All in all, good time with good company and I will come back for more taste-testing of different beers."}
{"text":"Serving size versus price was very imbalanced. After 80$ we both are still hungry and not even tipsy."}
{"text":"This place is convenient for me because it's close to where I live.

The theee stars are bc of the service which is acceptable. Nothing more. 

 I had the duck wings there with a pint white beer and was very satisfied with what I had. I just found out about their $1 oyster deal during the week so I'll definitely be back to try it out!"}
{"text":"Make sure you make reservations on Friday and Saturday nights because there is usually a huge line up that goes out the door.  The Patio is a good place to hang out for a few brewskees after a long day at the office.  The food is your basic bar food however I have had most of their items on the menu.  My favorite is their chicken poutine which goes down easy with a strong beer like Golden Draak or Scaldus! 

Needless to say...they have a Ton of Beer here from all over the world.  They also have a good selection of hard liqour for non beer drinkers as well.  Usually I would give this place 5 stars but the service is usually hit or miss depending how busy it is.

Nevertheless, this is by far the best location out of all the other Bier Markets in the GTA."}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch during a busy day! Good service.
I took the Schnitzel sandwich-gauffre that was excellent!"}
{"text":"Came here few days ago for the Summerlisious - it was so disappointing! For 20$ lunch you would expect something fairly decent but the food was really bad. We had to add sauces and salt for it to be eatable.
If you come for a beer I`m sure it`s a nice place but don`t bother to order food, really. You`d be better eating in a foodcourt:/"}
{"text":"I ordered the charcuterie board and the steak & fries. From when we went a few months earlier, the quality has certainly dipped. 

The charcuterie is no longer served with applesauce and whole-grain mustard; it's now served with yellow mustard and strawberry jam. What?

The steak was fine. The menu claimed 8 ounces but it sure looked more like 6. Fries were nothing to write about.

All in all, I find the food here extremely overpriced, and the service very slow. Be sure to check your bill after, because they automatically add gratuity...for a party of 2."}
{"text":"Great ambience, great beer with amazing food. Would go again anytime. Loved it !! Was there for a fondue and beer pairing menu via Amex card. Absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"One crazy Friday night around Midnight, after my salsa partners got bored of the dance floor in Scarborough and after a couple of drinks, we decided to join their friends at Bier Markt downtown Toronto. I've never been to Bier Markt before, even though I've walked passed it many times, so I was keen on checking it out. (Actually, to be honest, I didn't remember that I'd seen it before and thus I didn't know it was a bar, I thought it was a night beer market festival at the Distillery District, like those Asian night markets that happen once a year. And since I'm not a beer drinker, no one can blame me for not knowing that it's a bar!)

When we finally arrived at the Bier Markt at around 1AM, I shocked to see a bar SO packed. (The bar was probably close to reaching its capacity limit.) Although it was very dark and loud on the inside, there was still an upscale European feel to it, meaning it wasn't ghetto at all. (Which is perfect for me!) The bar serves a trendy older crowd, -most people were just a tad older than me and came off as young professionals. (Very much like the crowd at Mill Street Brewery in the Distillery District.)

As the name may hint, the bar has a wide selection of beers from all around the world. Although it carries your typical domestic beer, like Molson Canadian, it didn't carry the only beer that I'd ever finished a pint of: the Mill Street Organic, which was very disappointing to me. So I spent the night sipping my friend's Stella. 

Since the bar was so crowded on the inside, my party and I took it to the patio where we enjoyed each other's company over alot of beers with a serving of second hand smoke from adjacent tables. Despite the second hand smoke, I had a great time chatting it up with my friends and making new friends on the patio. Good weather, good company, good conversations, good drinks, all at a trendy King Street West setting,  what more can one ask for?"}
{"text":"Went to Toronto for a friend's wedding and he suggested we stop by here while I was exploring some friends.  This place has such a wide selection of different \"bier's\" that it would take multiple trips to even put a dent in the selection they have.  The staff is super nice and has tons of suggestions.  They even let us have taster samples before we commited to anything on tap!.

The only thing preventing me from giving them 5 stars was because we found the $10 banana bread bier at Bier Markt for $3.50 at LCBO afterwards.  Otherwise this is a great place to widen your bier palate."}
{"text":"This was literally one of the worst lunch experiences of my life. I had ordered a poutine ($9.00), it was a small bowl half full a gravy with like 20 fries swimming in gravy. It was disgusting! I will never go to this location again. Even the people the table over sent back their food. Biggest waste of $40! Save your money and go anywhere else in the area. This is also the 1st review I have ever left because I feel the need to tell you guys!! I actually went over to Panera Bread after and got a bowl of soup, that's how bad it was!"}
{"text":"Spotted the place while walking by in the morning, and decided to stop in for dinner.

150 beers, tons of big screens, great food - need I say more?

Great ambiance in the repurposed space of the old steakhouse. Great selection of beers, both on top and in the bottles.

Poutine was very tasty, onion rings perfectly crunchy. Steamed mussels with bacon perfectly delicious, and enough fresh bread not to leave a drop of that tasty liquid behind. All together equal to a great evening.

Excellent service - prompt, attentive, friendly, knowledgeable.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Our server was phenomenal but as for everything else it was sub-par. When our food came out the fries were ice cold, and not just one batch but all 4 of our servings of fries. They then forgot the bacon on the chicken sandwich as well as the chicken was cold. By the end of the meal we were ready to pay and leave. 

The Bier Market is not on my list of places to return to"}
{"text":"Service is really good but live music sucks. I dont know what's wrong with the bands they hire."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend for all! The menu is such informative one, including pictures, origins, kinds of beer with brief summary for each. Love it! For a non-beer drinker, I found so much easier to select my right beer.  Services was great! Very fast. There is such a beautiful d√©cor for a vintage fan.  Good place for social gathering My friends and I enjoyed our night and drinks.  we will definitely come back"}
{"text":"There were some kids breathing on the window outside to make condensation drawings (presumably weeners) and the reindeer antlers I found on the chair at the bar had one of the antlers broken so I gave them to Drew. Otherwise good vibe, and the live music is definitely a plus. Superior selection of beer including Delirium and Hoffbraugh. I just wish I didn't have to wait so long for a bartender when there was barely anyone at the bar."}
{"text":"I went with a couple of my friends on a Saturday evening. We decided to wait in line seeing as there weren't that many people ahead of us. The security guy came up to us and informed us that there was a dress code and that we couldn't enter since me and one of my other friends were wearing a t-shirt. His exact words were, \"collared shirts only\". 

We decided to go to Scotland Yard next door. As we left the line I saw 3 gentlemen wearing t-shirts, one of them even in flip flops. After we left Scotland Yard (a place I strongly recommend), the line had grown substantially longer. I made it a priority to count how many individuals were in t-shirts; from the people I saw, there were 16 of them.

I don't make things about race ever, I usually think it's weak, but out of the friends I was with the two of us who were in t-shirts were dark skinned Tamil men. All the individuals in t-shirts were either Caucasian or Asian.  

Further more, I mentioned this story to a friend of mine. He knows a person who works in Bier Markt and he mentioned that it's common practice for them to turn away groups of coloured men because \"they probably won't pay their tab\". I should mention that this was nothing more than hearsay, but after my experience I can't help but believe that it's true."}
{"text":"From years back that I can remember the original Bier Markt I knew of was on the Esplanade.  I didn't like that place.  It was overly crowded and the food wasn't worth it nor was it that great.  This was a long time ago when we went there and I haven't been back since.

Fast forward to the present and I ended up coming to the Bier Markt across from Sherway on the corner of North Queen and Queensway and this location and place is light years better than my original Bier Markt experience on the Esplanade.

To be fair I didn't have a full blown meal here yet but I have come to the Bier Markt twice in two evenings (the past two actually).  I had come here after having dinner with friends just up the street on Wednesday and last evening I had a meet up with another friend for a quick snack and drink.  

The beer selection at this place is absolutely awesome.  If you like beer this place has it.  On draught, in bottles, from here, from there, blonde, amber, ales, stout you name it, it's here.  If you like beer I think you'd be hard pressed to not find something here that would appeal to you.  The beer menu is to me, the beer version of a Cheesecake Factory menu.  It has TABS so you can easily flip to a brew of your liking, yes the menu is nuts and impressive if not overwhelming.  Menu items display ABV (alcohol content by volume) percentage as well as IBU (International bittering units) which is a metric for the bitterness, hoppyness of the brews.

Besides having an incredible list of drinks the menus for just apps are decent.  I've had some of the sausage board which is a nice mix of different sausages that comes with two warm pretzels.  We were told yesterday that there was a 2 for 1 special on duck wings and we ended up also ordering the seasonal \"bier schetta\" which is a board with a half dozen dressed bruschetta made their way.  The bruschetta was ok but the duck wings were fabulous.  Talk about a tasty non conventional finger food that are full of flavor and truly mouth watering.  

The duck wings were so tender went so well with my hoppy drink.

The ambiance is nice and there are actually 2 outdoor patios, one that faces the Queensway with high tables and another near the entrance that faces North Queen with low tables.  The service seems to be ok and the inside is just great with nice space, lighting and a feel good overall vibe.
 
I didn't know that Bier Markt is now a part of the Cara group but I noticed it when my wife gave me a Cara gift card and Bier Markt was on the list of restaurants just like the usuals such as Harvey's, Montana's, Swiss Chalet, Kelsey's etc.  I have to say the food at Bier Markt is really inline with the drinks you'd be ordering so this place just doesn't seem like your typical out of the box across the board type of Cara \"safe choices\" food kind of places.  It doesn't have a feel of a chain type place at all not that that really matters.

I'd definitely come back here for some good drinks and more not so every day food items."}
{"text":"Love the vibe every time I go here. The staff is always so accommodating and polite yet friendly. We came for lunch and had just missed breakfast. No one was at the restaurant so they were willing to speak to the chef about slipping me breakfast which was amazing but I decided to just go with the main menu after all. This is a great spot for a date since the food is amazing plus the vibe is great. Most casual dining places are just great for drinks and apps but this place exceeds that. 

I had the Mussels and Frites (Thai Curry) and they were delicious and the sauce was thick! I asked for it to be extra spicy and so the chef delivered with extra Thai chillies.

My parter had the streak medium rare which melted in my mouth. 

Oysters - the sauces served with the oysters here were amazing!"}
{"text":"High end beer resto with local & international micro brews with varied food menu."}
{"text":"Had to try something with candied bacon in it since so many other yelpers recommended it. I was not disappointed! Had the candied bacon caesar which was incredibly good! Lettuce and kale was crisp, a good amount of dressing, lots of bacon, and garlic croutons. Came in a large portion which I like because paying $13+ for a salad always doesn't seem worth it to me at other places.

We had a hard time deciding what to drink because the bar menu is so expansive. I settled on their sangria (delicious and sweet made with Strawberry wheat beer).

There was a live band playing during our visit and they were quite good. I also enjoyed watching the Olympics on the TV screens so if the people you're with are boring atleast there's other entertainment haha."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes all√©s un mercredi soir pour un 5@7 entre coll√®gues.

{"text":"Weird - this place is a meat market on weekend night but a beer lover's paradise by day.  I am not sure how they pulled that off.  We came Friday night and were deterred by the line.  We came back on Sunday afternoon and were greeted by paradise.  Delerium Tremens on tap FTW!  The beer selection is outstanding.  I wish I had appetite for food, but that was not to be on this day."}
{"text":"I find the Bier Market a popular for locals as well as out of towners sampling what going out in Toronto can be like. I've had good times, meh-times and \"I'd rather be somewhere else\" times here hence the average star rating. 

Yes their beer selection is great, but this is a city where a good beer selection is not hard to come by if you know where to look, while other locations might not have as many beers as Bier Market they probably have enough for you to be content with at a better price and a more relaxing atmosphere (if that's what you're after)

It doesn't matter if you look 20 or 40, everyone seemed to get carded on the weekends which made me feel like I was at a club over in Richmond, which I try to avoid. The crowd once inside though was made of all kinds of people from early 20s all the way to some in their 50s (I'm talking about on weekends when it's more club-like), and for anyone that's single this seems like a good place to meet fellow singles, so remember to dress nice :) 

If I were to come here for dinner I wouldn't mind paying close to $10 for a beer (and the food they serve is top notch but it's been a while since I came here for a meal). But on weekend nights when getting a table can be a two hour wait and when most of us are made to stand around in the back with the crowds and live band in a toned down club like vibe, I rather not pay $10 for beer when I'm being shoved around and not be able to enjoy it. The live music here is not what I would call fantastic, the particular band when I was here last played covers of very random songs which I would have appreciated a DJ spin instead. 

I can't find fault in the bartenders though, the bar is not manned by just a couple of bartenders but at least 4 or 5 were taking orders making the wait times for a drink surprisingly quick for a large crowd. I even managed to have a short conversation with a bartender about a recommendation for a beer. They know their stuff and are friendly and efficient going about their business, so full props to them. 

Overall I would gladly find myself coming here for a relaxing drink and possibly think twice before heading over on a busy night, but it's located so close to Union that taking the GO back for me only involves leaving 10 minutes before my bus/train which for a commuter is a huge plus. But the vibe of this being too much like a mediocre club brings down my ratings of it, but I can see myself giving it a 4 star after my next positive visit here."}
{"text":"Wow! Visited it once when needed a widescreen for champions league final and was really amazed! The beer selection is overwhelming. IPA? Heh, about 20+ various IPAs! 

The service is great, friendly and fast!

Strongly recommend this place!"}

{"text":"I booked Bier Markt for my daughter's 1st birthday with a huge group of family on an early Sunday afternoon. I wasn't impressed with the service, or the food. The reservation process was good, but my actual experience was horrible. They did offer me a gift certificate as compensation, but I wouldn't recommend booking a large party here. 

I chose it because I like the atmosphere and its a good location. Lots of natural light, and seemingly a good place to host a lunch party for a big group. But clearly the server was not experienced in handling big groups, and I was really disappointed. 

Food is overpriced and mediocre. I knew this going into this, but the $25 set lunch menu, which I was able to customize seemed okay. As with the other locations, I wish they would cut portions in half, and half the price. Portions are huge, and doesn't need to be. 

When we arrived, there was a long line up at the hostess table, and no one to be seen. She was running around bringing people to their tables. This is when someone else should have been called to help with that. I knew where our reservation was, but I felt like I still needed to check in, and waited 10 minutes anxiously. 

When we finally got to our area, we were just left there. We needed a high chair. I wasn't introduced to our server, nor did she introduce herself which I would have expected. We are dropping a lot of $$ here today! After about 10 mins, I had to find her myself. 

She was friendly, however, didn't really gauge the crowd properly, and started rattling off the specials to the first few people that were there, who weren't really ready to listen to her bc we were socializing. When we finally sat down to and she began to take our orders, drinks were all taken first (with such a huge crowd and set menu, I think all the orders should have been taken right then and there), but only half our party got to order drinks. It wasn't until 30 mins later, she came back and did the rest. We had to wait 30 mins for orange juice?! 

Our salads , which had no choice, could have come out any time. Instead, only came out once we went to order food. About ONE HOUR after the salads came out, she tells me they JUST put in the entrees order. WTF? And it never arrived until about another 30 mins later. (an aside: my immune system went into overdrive because I was so hungry and ended up getting a fever and sick). 

At some point before our entree got there, another server had the audacity to ask if we were still using our high chair. Were they that oblivious? 

I ordered the chicken schnitzel for my daughter, and it was a dry piece of cardboard on top of very salty fries. I don't recommend it. By the time our food finally arrived, I was feeling so sick, that I couldn't even eat it. Flat bread was okay, the burger was okay nothing special.

I've expressed some of these concerns to management, and they offered me another $50 gift certificate to dine there again.  I'm hesitant to even go. 

Bier Markt doesn't have the appeal anymore even though they stock tons of variety of beers. With craft breweries all over Toronto, I'd rather support them."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre. It lacks flavour and is nothing special. The service was slow and was charged 18% automatically despite the lack of service. The waitress was clearly overwhelmed and we spent most of our time looking for her to ask for basic things like another drink or ketchup. They either need to hire more competent staff or just more servers who can keep up with the demand. There are better places in Toronto such as the village idiot pub, that serve a good selection of beer and have decent service and food quality. A big disappointment."}
{"text":"We love sampling new beer from around the world and our first time at Bier Markt was very very disappointing. The patio area is great, beer selection is good, food is ok, our server was nice BUT the cleanliness is a big issue. 

The plates that we were given were coated with orange colour oily grime and our server was very apologetic and gave us clean plates. We ordered frites and while we were eating then we found a chicken bone...YES A CHICKEN BONE among the frites!!!! The manager apologized and took the frites off our bill. 

Def NOT going back to the Sherway garden location."}
{"text":"I gotta say...I'm not really a big fan of this place to go to party. It's kinda douchey. But if you're looking for a dinner, it's awesome. The schnitzel  is unbelievable and on Thursday's they have a beef rib special that will blow your mind. Order it with the freshest, cleanest pint of Stiegl you'll find in the city. The charcuterie plate also kicks ass."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer at this location. Tonight was an extremely disappointing experience. 

I've ordered the smoked salmon, there were so much skin on it that I cannot even lift it off the plate. I've flagged my waitress down and she informed us that even if they were to cut me another slice, it will have skin. 

On to the duck wings special. Thursday night special is supposed to be $14 buy one get one free. Let alone buy one get one free, I can't even finish one drum as it was so tough. However, the manager was very professional and came out to speak with me and apologized. I can say that as a result of the manager, initially I wasn't going to return again. I will give come back to give it another chance."}
{"text":"20 mins wait for just water. This is when we visited them at 3.30 pm which is lowest capacity. Asked for water over 3 times and food and drinks infact took more than 45 mins. Think before you come. And this bad service is a constant pretty much over the last 3 visits"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place but nothing too special. Pricey menu, decent beer list, really good service, decent atmosphere. 

It was fine, I would stop by again if it was convenient but wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"One of the better beer selections I've seen, and the staff always seems to be super knowledgeable. 

The food is decent, but nothing spectacular. The beer selection more than makes up for it, though. 

Go in on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon and sit at the bar. You'll deal with probably the best beer bartender I've ever seen. I just go off his suggestions at this point."}
{"text":"Great Beer and Great Food!

The poutine here was really good...the live band was awesome... but their list of imported beers was definitely mindblowing!

I don't even remember the names of all the beers I got to try but I do remember that they had my favorite (Hoegarden) in a ginormus mug!"}
{"text":"If you're ever craving for a unique worldwide beer selection and some entertaining live music, Bier Markt always lives up to that expectation.  This location is always busy on Friday and Saturday nights, and we had to wait about 10-15 minutes for a table.  Once seated, we were kindly helped by our waiter, who was able to give thoughtful suggestions based on our desires.

For someone relatively new to the grand selection of worldwide beers, the beer menu is very informative and easy to navigate, categorizing beers based on country and style, and also had a glossary of terms.  I'm a fan of IPA, and always enjoy the Chouffe Houblon.  The presentation is a nice touch, in that each glass is matched up to the appropriate draught beer.  I also tried their Hasser√∂der, which was on limited time availability, which was a delight but didn't necessarily stand out.  The beer selection definitely overshadows the food - I had a pork schnitzel, which was a somewhat bland in taste.

The live music is one of the main reasons I came back - I'm a huge fan of live music, and the bands generally play cover songs with a rock interpretation.  The lead singer from the band \"Blush\" had a powerful voice and really helped bring the restaurant to life.  However because of the live music, conversation can become more challenging, but it's worth it.

Would not hesitate to return or try the other locations."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! This place used to be awesome. Great food, good drinks super fun vibe. NOW it is swiss chalet with taps. Boo. What a fail. Their French fries alone before were worth the trip. Fresh crisp with mayo that was so good I wanted to eat it all by itself.   We ordered fries and fondue tonight, previously two of their best dishes. We had to send both back. Cara foods (Harvey's, swish chalet and a glut of other never do anything good restaurants) bought this place a couple of years ago and have put the nails in the coffin. 
Never coming back.   Thanks for killing two great bars with one crap middle of the road excuse for a restaurant."}
{"text":"The Bier Markt is my go to \"I am feeling lazy and want to walk about 5 steps to find somewhere to eat\" place. 

Sundays will find brunch served with some live music. Monday to Saturday night, this place is always pretty busy, if the weather is nice then the patio (as with most places) is very busy. Friday/Saturday nights, after say 9.30/10 be prepared for potential queues to get in. Saturday night tends to not be a time I would go as the crowd seems a bit younger.

Beer: Great beer selection...in fact great beer menu! So many choices, so little time. I have to say the first time when I visited and was handed a novel style beer menu and asked for my order within 5 minutes, i was a little bit panic stricken as I had not made it past the third page. So the menu isn't exactly \"War and Peace\" but be prepared for some decent amount of searching. Beer cocktails...sound awful, are actually pretty damn tasty. 

Food: I like the food here and have eaten here several times. Mussels are good, Markt fries come with some a few dips (the mustard mayo number is really tasty), platters are decent. Most recently I had brunch and tried the Benedict, which instead of being served on a muffin is served on potato rosti, delicious dish and I would highly recommend. Bison burger, expensive but heavenly meaty goodness!

The Bar: My only complaint are the curtains that you have to fight to get through, just past the main door. I do not know how I have managed to get tangled in them so many times/trip over the bottom of them. I just find them really disorientating, like almost stepping into the wardrobe and finding you are in Narnia. The bar is quite dark, but I love the decor, just feel they need more seats at the actual bar."}
{"text":"I gave it three stars for the convenience factor and having a good night out. However, the place is literally just packed with men or boys should I say. Try going with a few girlfriends for some drinks but it was impossible to feel comfortable as boys just stared."}
{"text":"Pretty good place, great location, over 150 different beers!!!!
We were a large group unfortunately things were disorganized people were done eating the pork while others had not been served. I received my soup after I was done eating main course. I ordered dessert and never received it and it took over 20 min to get a beer you ordered...
It's a nice experience but cost around 115$ for 2 beers, main course and a soup so the value was not really there for that amount. I am going back for lunch next week hopefully the a la carte menu is better"}
{"text":"150 beers, if that doesn't get you here I don't know what will.
The service is great, the food is tasty.
Though if you order a schnitzel, please specify that you want it pan seared in butter (they'll gladly do so).
If you don't you'll get a dry deep-fried schnitzel...and believe me you do not want that.
The way it's prepared makes all the difference.
This is not the fault of the kitchen, it's just what they're told to do, so it in no way reflects badly on them.
Oh and get some pretzels, they're good stuff."}
{"text":"Nice place for drinks only.  When we finally got our table the server was very sweet.   We ordered and the food took awhile.  When we got our food they had forgotten half our order.  Very disappointing.  Left feeling hungry."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to suggest to my husband--he's Belgian and loves his beer--but best of all he thinks he's getting his way when really, I'm also getting mine ;) Bier Markt has, without a doubt, the best beer selection in the city, consistently.
BM has a 'Fondue Feastivul' they do early in the year and it's perfect for wintertime. I actually recall one balmy summer day last year when I stopped and remembered this new wintertime tradition and my mouth watered. 

We went back recently and I tried the 'Monsieur Und Fondue' as well as the 'Peanut Butter Fondue', mmmmmmm. Now that's pub food! My husband ordered a tried-and-true, fish and chips, but he certainly helped me finish my double order of fondue! I don't know if I'll be able to make it back there to try any others before the fest is over, though. I wish it ran year-round but it ends Feb 26."}
{"text":"Early dinner service good had veal schnitzel tasty great beer selection"}
{"text":"Welcome to planet Jupiler...no, not Jupiter...don't be silly.

JUP-I-LER is a tasty beer that they have on tap at this joint. It was sooo good that I had to return for another on the following afternoon. (It wasn't too far out of the way since our hotel was right across the Esplanade). 

I looked for more Jupiler to bring home but didn't see it in any of the Toronto beer shops (by the way....buying alcohol in Toronto on Easter Weekend is NO easy process thanks to the LCBO). 

FOOD:
- Scallops and Prawns. OK, but not amazing, very overcooked and over spiced.
- Belgian Cobb Salad w/ rare beef filet. The concept / presentation was neat, but the overall taste did not match. I found it rather plain, perhaps it was the Belgian endive that threw the combo off.

ATMOSPHERE: 
Well done on the inside, but a bit vanilla for my tastes. Its ironic saying this as a visitor but the place seemed a bit 'touristy'. Wednesday was 'vinyl nite' so a large painting on the far wall slides away to reveal a DJ that plays blaring music while you eat. Some of the music selections where good, but most where not to my taste. I don't believe I saw the 'DJ' actually use any vinyl, but I could be wrong since I was knee deep in Jupiler by the time he took to the 'stage'!"}
{"text":"WOW Bier Markt, WOW.

Here's my short synopsis:

1) Hopping place on a Friday night, line ups are not unusual
2) Bar staff was awesome: ask for Tommy
3) Live band was great
4) Great dancing available
5) Expensive... like really expensive (you don't realize it until the day after and you see a wad of receipts in your purse)
6) The per capita of sleazy people seems to be lower here

Try it out on a weekend just to check out the scene, totally worth it and right by the GO bus if you are like me and from the GTA!

Grooving."}
{"text":"Lots of choices for beer, this is great happy hour and patio place.  However, if you're expecting dinner here, be prepared to pay $$$

Popular food choices include mussel at $21/lb and a $19 cobb salad. You can also get entrees for $30+ or flatbreads (good enough for one person really for $15 on average). 

beet and wine cost about $8 per glass/pint. 

We got a flight of 6 cheeses for $20. It was okay, brie, rochfort  + a couple harder cheeses like emmental. Comes with toasted bread and a fruit compote 

I really like the $9 Praline Trio. A chocolate truffle, some cheese cake melt in your mouth cake and a chocolate praline swirl."}
{"text":"A lovely place, with great food. But beers are phenomenal -in particular local brewed beers (Tracteur, fin du monde....). Strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm not even going to begin to explain the series of events that resulted in the WORST service I have EVER had. Let's just start with the end... I had a $175 bill which seemed a little too high. I noticed I had a meal on my bill I know my girlfriend who just left had already paid for. I brought it up to the server who told me my friends who left said that I would be taking care of that meal and it was to go on my bill. Not going to argue with her as my friends are gone to prove that they had it on theirs. I get home, call my friends... sure enough she had already paid for the meal it was on her bill also. So there's an extra $18 of legitimately NOTHING I just paid for. When I tried to correct the bill I was told it was right... no one checked over to look at the other bills nothing. Just pay it and get out.... so thanks guys for the 18 dollar over charge. I hope your waitresses who took 25 minutes to bring us water and only two for a table of 4, your kitchen staff who took well over an hour for our food or maybe the waitresses again on that one and your hostesses who attempted to take away a portion of our table because two of our guests were running late but the other 3 were there but don't worry... she informed us that it's because they only allow a 15 minute grace period for late patrons, after we had been sitting there for OVER AN HOUR waiting for our food... but gave us that extra time as a favour enjoy the extra cash. Also thanks for adding a tip onto my bill to make sure the 4 waitresses we had who essentially just continuously messed up got their even share of cash. Tipping on a meal I didn't even order or better yet one that was already paid for."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet - food and beer is awesome, service is nonexistent. I got the oysters and a blonde beer and it was all delicious and fresh but getting a server's attention was difficult. We also ordered a Swedish cocktail which was garnished with Swedish berry candy but we got the cocktail and it didn't have any of the candies that we were looking forward to. When we asked the waitress why we didn't get any and she told us after serving it to us that they were all out of stock. As a server she needs to inform us before we receive it and ask if we'd like something else or at least make some kind of attempt to make it up to the customer (discount, substitution etc). Overall, good food and beers, nice patio in a lovely area, but pretty lousy service."}
{"text":"Wait staff is good..no real flow to the bar..odd setup
Bar staff has zero personality..better chance of conversing with a mime"}
{"text":"Beer! Beer! As far as the eye can see! Friendly and helpful servers? Check. Amazing food? Half-check. DAS BIER? Mais oui! 

I'm not a huge beer person. I like ciders, but not sickeningly sweet ones. Our waitress steered me towards the Pear cider who's name I can't remember (although it sounded like 'pear' or maybe started with a 'p'). It was very tasty, a touch sweet, and served RIGHT cold. 

The food was good, but forgettable, which is better than being remembered for being terrible."}
{"text":"Bier Markt is good, for a chain restaurant. They have the usual pub food and wide selection of beers. I like their outdoor patio seating a lot at this Shops at Don Mills location."}
{"text":"I know people love the bier market for the amount of beer selection and trust me, I prefer beer over wine, but is it just me or does anyone else find the beer selection overwhelming? They took my favourite beer off tap, Estella and now I feel there is absolutely no point to going there. The food is SO mediocre, the service was annoying and the live music was extremely loud we could not hear eachother speak. This place is so meh which is unfortunate because the location is primo for etobicoke!"}
{"text":"The outskirts of Toronto are somewhat of a wasteland of good, craft beer. Venture like 20 minutes from the downtown core and Rickards will be the closest thing to craft beer you can get at a lot of places. However this Bier Markt is an oasis of beer in the vast, desolate wasteland of the GTA. 

I came here this past Sunday because they were having a birthday party for Belgium. This location is at the shops on Don Mills, a higher end outdoor mall. When I arrived I was asked if my name was on the guest list for the birthday bash, when I said no the hostess didn't blink and offered me a table on the section of the patio closed off for the party. This location is quite large and has a decent sized patio facing a few parking spaces, away from the hustle and bustle of the shops. 

The beer menu here is quite extensive, spanning about 25-30 pages broken down by country with a large selection of both draught and bottled beer. Although the menu is vast the beers they carry are not particularly exotic or rare and can be found at most LCBO's or good beer joints in the city. Nonetheless it's good to have a nice selection of beers without having to venture into the city. 

On this day they had free appetizers going around the party section. I got to sample a few things; the food was ok but did not blow my socks off. My favourite was probably the wings and the porchetta sliders. I've tried their food at one of the downtown locations and it was subpar as well so I would recommend you come here for some good beer rather than dinner (lots of other dining options nearby). The service on this day was sublime, and very attentive. When my yelp friend wanted to move 3 times in search of some shade they accommodated us with nothing but a smile. I will definitely return to this location, maybe it will give me an excuse to go shopping."}
{"text":"Had the Bankok mussels with fries. The mussels were tasty, but the fries were really saggy...
The beer menu is really impressive and useful. I tried three different belgian beers. The one with the pig in the label has a lot of authentic flavors, like coriander and orange, and was my favorite. Delirium is really heavy, but the consistency is awsome. After the delirium one can't remember the name of the other one I drank...
Cheers!!!
Went back there on Canada Day with my sister, cousin and husby, and I need to update my review...
Even tho, the place wasn't crowded, the service was awful...
The waitresses are rude, clumsy, and if you are not in their area, they refuse to help you out.
We waited long time for our drinks, and when we ordered food for sharing, they didn't pick up our dishes. Not even when they brought more food, and noticed our table was full. My husband got upset and just put the dishes on the table behind him.
When I went to the washroom, one of the staff, a tall bold with glasses, kind of geeky looking guy, bumped into me, and wasn't polite enough like for say: I'm sorry. He even looked kind of angry with me.
I won't go back because I don't want to die of thirstiness..."}
{"text":"The last time I went here, I found the experience to be fairly lacking. First of all, most of the beer that I wanted from their menu was not available. Secondly, the food which i was served, was uninspired at best. The cheese was ok, the sausage i tried was greesy and tasteless. The server was really nice, but it did take her a while to get around though she may have just been really busy. I enjoyed the beer that I finally did get, but it was hard to really order anything given the fact that almost othing I wanted on their menu was there .]

I did enjoy the live music there though, they did have a decent vibe, and I liked the set that was played. It was probably a redeeming quality of the establishment. 

I think in the future I would probably chose to go to some other establishment, I was less than impressed with my experience here."}
{"text":"With so many variety of beer on tap how can you go wrong?  This is one of my go to places for entertaining or for a cold brew on a hot afternoon. 

They have their own take on pub fair. Food is decent if a bit pricey. Chicken wings are really good but a bit on the spicy side."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious and food is amazing. Atmosphere is great  music is good. Had a salad,mussels,creme brulee all was amazing.server was great always making sure food and drinks were good. Would definitely come back and try regular menu. :)"}
{"text":"Uhh...okay, I've never been to a Bier Markt before, so you can imagine my surprise when they told me, we have over 150+ beers on tap.  Well, bartender actually meat 150+ beers total, not on tap.  Regardless, I was handed a book in what I thought was the food menu.  Nope. Drinks menu.  I had no idea where to start. Bartender pointed out to me that it had tabs organized by type of beer.  For most people, they would know what to do.  Unfortunately, I was still dumbfounded, so I asked \"I want something light, but fruity\".  She recommended the Stiegl Grapefruit Radler.  It was exactly what I needed on a hot summer day.  

Went down smooth and tasted more like a spirit than a beer, but I was very happy with it.  

So overall for the bar service/drinks: 5/5.  

Food: I only ordered the Pastrami Poutine because I got inspired (tangent: I'm getting annoyed that spell check says poutine is not a word) by an online pic.  Fries were good, pastrami was okay but it was too shaved for my liking as opposed to big thick slices.  It was acceptable, but nothing great.  3/5. 

Overall, this is a great new bar in the area that also has a nice patio."}
{"text":"They have a great beer selection although the vast majority of them cost around 20 dollars a bottle. Despite that they do have some very cool beers at reasonable prices like roddenbach grand cru and frampton brasse nuit d'automne.
The food is good but pricey. The service is hit or miss some great waiters and some boderline rude waiters.
Not a great place to watch sports as low hanging lamps block the tvs."}
{"text":"We usually love this place.

Unfortunately on Friday night when we stopped in for dinner everything seemed to fall apart. 

We waited 15 minutes to see a server.  It was not busy so we weren't sure what the problem was.

We ordered and waited another 20 minutes for an appetizer that never arrived  (but the meal did).  We mentioned that we missed the appetizer all together.  They brought us a half appetizer at no charge. 

The food was barely warm.

This experience is not like the experiences we have had here in the past.

Kind of sours you on a restaurant when your overall experience is that poor.

We likely won't be back for a while.  There are a lot of pubs and restaurants in the area that do consistently well."}
{"text":"Bier Markt is one of those places where the drink menu is the size of a small novel. It really makes me wish I had a higher appreciation of alcoholic beverages. Unfortunately, I'm one of those people that can be surrounded by every beautiful shade of brown and black, exotic and craft beers, and order an apple cider (I'm so sorry). 

I came here for Winterlicious lunch. It was a three course meal for $23, which I say is a reasonable price for the amount of food we got. My friend got a Mojito, which was very delicious and very dangerous. It's made with Somersby and doesn't have a hint of alcoholic taste. Dangerous. 

Appetizer: I got the pear and apple salad. It was very average, a bit bland tasting. The dressing was very light (a bit too light) but the blue cheese offered a nice salty change. There were slices of apple and pear, and pecans (which are always really good). My friend got the duck wings which were very crispy and tender. I didn't get to try the sauces but she said they were very flavourful. The chicken soup was ok, tasted like any regular chicken soup. It has a lot of sp√§tzle and veggies though so it's actually the most filling of the appetizers. 

Entree: I got the mussels and frites. The ratio of mussels to fries was very good and it's great to see a place not cheap out on the seafood while loading up on starch. They come flavoured STRONGLY in garlic. The mussels tasted fresh and weren't overcooked. Only problem I had was these mussels tend to stick to the shell for some reason, which meant I had to destroy them with my fork to scrape them out. The other entrees (a burger and a chicken flatbread) both looked really good but I didn't get to try them. My friends said they were both enjoyable. 

Dessert: I really liked the Creme Brul√©e. The burnt sugar top was relatively thick and the custard was very smooth. It comes with a wildberry compote that was a good pairing with the sweet custard. The chocolate cake is also very rich and has nice flavour. 

I think overall, the food here is fairly average. It's not very memorable but I enjoyed my time here. Service was friendly and accommodating, and the food arrived at our table relatively quickly. I'm not sure if I will come here again because at regular price, it seems a tad expensive. They do have fondue though...so maybe just for that.

{"text":"I was really happy to be able to sit on the patio outside. Not because it was a nice day (which it was), but the inside honestly gave me a \"spooky house of horrors\" vibe. Dark heavy curtain blocking the entrance, extremely dim lighting, metal contraptions behind a glass wall being eerily lit by red light. All it needs are a couple of skeletons and the look is complete. But who knows, maybe it's just because I had a little too much to drink. 

Having been to the Bier Markt at Don Mills, I was pretty sure I'd know what to expect: a drink menu that would take a day to read and food that borders on forgettable. I was happy to see all the drink selections again but I was also pleasantly surprised to find the food much better here than at the other location. 

I got the wild and tame mushroom risotto and while my friends said they have a homemade recipe that tastes better, I was still pretty happy with my order. The portion was large and the risotto was creamy with an abundance of tasty shrooms. My SO ordered fish and chips, which was satisfyingly crispy. To wash it down, I got a strawberry beer, which tasted more like soda than alcohol. 

While I still think this place is overpriced, I am grateful that they aren't cheaping out with their portion sizes. You're paying for decent food in a great location with the option of utilizing a pretty comfortable patio. Hopefully, you decide to enjoy it on a day when the restaurant next door isn't starting shit and 5 emergency vehicles aren't flashing their sirens in your face for 30 minutes. Good times.

They also have 3 flights (samplers) available that give a large portion of 6 beers and allow you to try different styles.  The best beer of the trip was the Dominus Vobiscum Triple, from Microbrasserie Charlevoix.  

My wife had the muscles Provencal, which she said was just OK.  The wine sauce and garlic was very good.  Large portion size but small muscle size.  I had the poutine with cheddar, steak, mushrooms, and pan gravy.  It was one of the best poutines I have had, but the portion was rather small.

I would come here again a few more times just to go through all the beers.  There are some less-than-exciting beers on the menu that you could get at any chain restaurant, but it is more than offset by the harder to find and local selections.

I would give it a 5 star rating if my wife enjoyed her muscles as much as I enjoyed my poutine."}
{"text":"This is the second time here and I feel this is a 4 star restaurant. The service is good and the food is great. The menu is different then most of the restaurant. The food is really good. There are so many kind of beer. If you're a beer lover then you must try it!"}
{"text":"Two stars for  the decent selection of beers they've got (but I ain't a beer drinker).  Not for the food.

The fondue was bland and lukewarm. I used to live in Switzerland so I am a bit particular about fondues and I was eager to try their version... underimpressed.
I had to open up the flame to heat it up, but it didn't really help, especially because the potatoes were cold and I mean ice cold.  I don't really care for potatoes in the fondue but since they were there we ate them.  Oh and the bread was OK but not superb. We ended up dunking the potatoes in the fondue pot and leaving them there for a while, sorry for the bad manners, so that they warm up and become edible.  

That was a few weeks ago and just recently I was there again with friends, this time at the Don Mills location and one of them ordered the fondue.  Okay, I will give them the benefit of the doubt, let's see this time... and yes, it was lukewarm again, tasted bland, and the potatoes were cold again, and another friend said that her fries on the side were also cold, so I suppose that's written in their manual to serve the potatoes cold.  Beats me.  Maybe we should have ordered the poutine to see if all of their potatoes were cold."}
{"text":"I would come back for the beer since they have a huge selection of fixed and seasonal draughts. It's a good place to relax after work with some coworkers in a really good location (Don Mills shop). The server was pretty knowledgeable about the beers and was quick to serve us (though it was a little slow when we had arrived). 

Food-wise, it's okay considering it's \"Canadian\" cuisine. The fish and chips were pretty decent, as in, not soggy, burnt, or flavourless, but kind of pricy - but expected."}
{"text":"A handful reasonably dressed, sober, professional 30-something guys in town for dinner on an otherwise pleasant Thursday night walk up to a mostly empty bar to grab a drink.  The Esplanade bouncer felt the need to jump straight to bad attitude.  So we walked straight into the next bar.  One star for undeserved pretentiousness and our subsequent rejection of your invitation to enter.  Next!"}
{"text":"We had lunch on their patio today.  It was very good.  We were impressed with the menu amd the selection of beer from around the world.

The service was excellent.  Our waitress was attentive and knowledgeable.

I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"The Bier Market has a great ambiance, the staff are friendly and attentive.  The day I went, there was a beer company hosting an event so I got to sample it in a small glass.  There are so much beers to choose from! from light beer all the way up to 7% plus beer.  From ale to lager to fruity drinks, they have the whole range.  Anyway, I was there for dinner and had the boullabaise.  It sounded good on paper and looked huge, but I did not like the light tomato flavouring and the lobster in it was shrunken and overcooked and had hard meat.  My companion ordered the mussels in white wine sauce, and the sauce was delectable, but the mussels itself were so miniscule.  The shell of the mussels remained large, but the mussels were like the size of a dime and looked shrunken.  The fries were great and came with three dips.  I really enjoyed the lemon dip.  I did see a platter of three poutines which looked appetizing, huge and filling.... maybe I'll try that next time.  This is a good place to chill and enjoy the summer.  The patio is great."}
{"text":"to be honest
i dont know who runs this place but definetely a few things wrong.

it took 10 mins to get seated even though there were seats open everywhere.

secondly the oysters we ordered were not clean they didn't even bother it's like they cut them open and chips of oyster shell still left in the oysters.
the funny thing to mention is that i've ordered a beets salad and it literally had 4 small diced pieces of beets.

the waaitresss was overloaded even though she was trying her best to stay on top of things she was clearly over run.

with that said for a saturday at shops of don mills they should know how busy its gets especially during dinner hour and staff accordingly

foodwise wasn't overly impressed like 2/5 just below average in terms of presentation and quality and service.
unfortunate"}
{"text":"Very nice and hip looking place. The food was good but not excellent. Pricing is a little out there for the type of slow service and food quality you get. 
In the end, it's a great place to try tons of beers from all around the world, but again, the prices are up there too."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto for the weekend and was looking for a couple of places to check out while in town.  We walked by this place on Friday night but was unable to get in because the bar stopped letting people in around 2am.  When we arrived on Saturday night we stood in line for ~15 min waiting for people to leave so we could get in.  By the time we got to the door we were greeted by one of the bouncers who looked at our passports and said 'Ah Americans!'.  First of all, yes we are.  Second of all, did you really have to say that??  After hearing this the people I was with walked in already annoyed which set this place up for failure.

Here's a summary of our 30 minute experience before finding the closest exit.

The place had a live band which was meh.
Beer was good, reasonably priced (pushed this place up from one star to 1.5-2)
Staff was quick.
This place should have been called Cougar Markt based on the females scouring the place.
The other 1/3 of the crowd were barely 21 but somehow managed to get inside.

Next time I'm in Toronto I will be sure not to come back.  No gracias."}
{"text":"I love Esplanade. It's has one of the best beer selections in all of downtown Toronto. Beers from all over the world and in many cases, the proper drinkware to sip it out of. I usually stick to drinking various regional brews from around Canada. This is where I first had Blanche de Chambly which is one of my all-time favorties. Food menu is very European meets sports bar and the short ribs are fantastic. Fries are so-so. Atmosphere is very Euro Sports Bar. You'll see a lot of people in English soccer or rugby getups or all sorts of NHL or Global hockey clubs. If you're a beer lover, this place is your heaven."}
{"text":"Excellent list of beers on tap (one of the only places I've found Stiegl outside of Austria) and the pouting was quite good. Can't speak to the other food but I'm sure it's at least above average for pub fare."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, I really did! Service was slow, and most disappointingly, the fondue was terrible! I think the cheese wasn't warmed up enough prior to serving; the cheese was actually not melted and the candle didn't seem to be doing anything (hence why I assume the cheese wasn't warmed up enough beforehand). I love fondue and anything cheese, so I thought this one was going to be a winner. I also had the mussels, which were okay but nothing to write home about. Definitely better than the fondue though."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place while visiting Montreal.  Great crowd, tons of beer choices, cool staff (Daphne is awesome!).  Tried many different beers, but ended up sticking with Stiegl.  All the appetizers were good...poutine with bacon, fried gouda bites, buffalo wings and flatbreads.  A little pricey, but worth it.

Had a great time pre and post hockey game."}
{"text":"They brew there own beer! Carry over 100 beers.....(salivating). Now they have Das boot mondays....Beer served in a glass boot! 

As far as food, I highly recommend the flatbreads! 

There is usually some \"A\" type bands playing there, Grafitti Park was the top 40 band I saw and they delivered."}
{"text":"Fab place to go out on a Saturday night.

We weren't 'feeling' Beerbistro at King/Yonge so we decided to relocate to King/Bathurst.  

The Bier Markt on the Esplanade is often the BM of choice so we decided to check out their other location. It's a lot smaller, but it seems to be more of a place to go out. The Esplanade location seems to have more of a 'dining in' vibe.

No cover. Check.
Live band playing covers of hits from bands like The Beatles, Oasis. Check.
Wide variety of beers to choose from. Check.
Great service. Check.
Food service. Check.

A solid five stars."}
{"text":"Do you ever have those nights when you just want to go out for a few drinks and then go back home? I was having one of those nights during the summer so my sister and I decided to check out the Bier Market in the Shops of Don Mills complex. 

This place is accessible by car and you can park this car in the free lot. For a Saturday night, it was pretty busy, but we were told that there would be no waiting time if we sat at the bar. The drink menu is L A R G E with beers from all over the world. My favorite beer would have to be the Fruehli and they have it on T A P (awesome x infinity). Sitting at the bar, we enjoyed our drinks, while listening to a live band (they weren't the best, but not the worst). With our drinks, we ordered some food - you can't go wrong with the frites, a generous portion of fries with a few dipping sauces. I will definitely be back because I'm a fan of this place - yay.

Good for: drinks, live music"}
{"text":"easy night out, 
somewhat young crowd, little rowdy at times, but food is consistent, beer selection is good, live music is a bonus..
I like their flatbread, mussels, and frits..
in the summer, i really enjoy their patio but for rest of the year inside is nice as well..
my regular hang out for sure.."}
{"text":"The crowd here is pretty laid-back usually not too pretentious. The beers selection is simply incredible - I've never seen anything like it back in the states. It's nice that places like this in Toronto have that heavier European  influenced culture & style. The interior decor is very old fashioned and cozy. Very welcoming. And the outside seating area has a nice Euro vibe as it's situated in a great part of town for people watching. The crowd is typically 25-40 - and the food served here is good for bar food. In the summertime, which is when I was there, it's nice to sit outside and just people watch while soaking in some sun. The interior seems to be lively at night with DJ-music and sometimes even live music! This is a great place to have some midday beers in the sun in the summertime - and a great place to make a laid back night of - or to start off a fast paced night at!!!

My favorite beer here is a hard to find one - Tripel Karmeliet. It's a medium-bodied Belgian ale that does NOT disappoint. It would take me months to truly try every interesting beer here - but of the ones I tried - this one stuck out as a very satisfying one!"}
{"text":"Looked nice from the outside as I waited in the pouring rain to be let in but since the business strategy here is creating the illusion of \"cool\" by making people form a line when there is nothing going on inside, I give it two giant thumbs down. It's a cold and rainy Friday night and we just want to have a bier but you make us wait outside - for what?! Never again."}
{"text":"I've visited this location 3 times in the last year and all three visits were pretty mediocre. On the first visit, the server basically laughed at me when I asked for a certain cocktail to be made virgin. She said the bartender wouldn't do it, without even asking him, then asked me why I don't drink (I was pregnant at the time, and I'd had a certain drink made virgin at another location, and it's none of her business). She then got several of the items on our charcuterie board wrong. The manager fixed it in the end so we ended up getting extra food for free, but still an inconvenience.

The second visit I ordered the pork schnitzel, which was so overcooked it was nearly impossible to cut apart and chew. And the spaetzle was burnt and crispy.

The third visit (a couple days ago) I ordered the chicken schnitzel benedict off the brunch menu. The chicken was overcooked and tough (much like the pork), and the poached eggs on top were cooked so long the yolk was completely solid.

Bier Markt is great, but not this location. I'm sticking to the King St location."}
{"text":"Great place, many different beers! Very chill atmosphere, they had live music as well. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"I give 5 stars for the service but probably only 3.5 or 4 stars for the food. It's a little overpriced and average for the amount you actually get. But the service from the wait staff and the general atmosphere has been fantastic. We're here on an Easter Monday so its relatively quiet. The beer selection is remarkable. But I always stick to my favourite which is Delirium Tremens. Strong and goes down so easy. Don't have more than 2 or you might start to forget the meal entirely ;) potent stuff."}
{"text":"I popped in here with my wife for a quick drink and bite to eat. We were there on a thursday around 7ish and the place was pretty busy. 

Our server was super helpful and knowledgable. We opted for one of those tasters with 6 small beers and we were both impressed at how good the beers were. Specifically the beers listed below.

Affligem Blond Abbey  Ale, Palm Amber Ale, Leffe Brune Ale

The Bier Markt poutine was also very good. Had an interesting peppercorn flavour. I definitely recommend it.

Now if you want to try to carry on a conversation, Bier Markt isn't really the place for that. Its super noisy and has a tendency to be super crowded. Think of it like a club on the weekends."}
{"text":"I don't get why people like this place so much.  The food is generic, the service is average at best.  I'm usually pretty generous giving out 4 or 5 stars. But this place is disappointing. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for some drinks. Nice atmosphere with lots of people and good music. It was pretty full so it was difficult to get a seat. However, drinks were good and it's a great place if you're looking for a bar without a long line."}
{"text":"Came here without reservations on a Friday night around 6pm. I think I came at a good time, because we didn't have to wait too long for a patio table for 2. The waitress who served us (unfortunately, I don't remember her name) was enthusiastic, attentive (but not overly so), and knowledgable about her beers. 

To start, we had the gouda bombs ($12), and I had the provencale mussels and frites ($22). Gouda bombs were okay - can't really go wrong with fried cheese and fancy ketchup. The cheese bites were fried nicely, but I felt that the price is a little steep for the portion size. The mussels, on the other hand, came in a very generous portion; I could only finish half before I had to surrender the rest to my dinner companion. The fries were nicely done, and came with 3 sauces; ketchup, curry mayo, and horseradish mayo. This entree also came with a crusty rosemary bread. 

TLDR; 7/10. I would come back, but next time I'm in the area, I'd rather try something else."}
{"text":"When my friends and I walked through the doors we were immediately greeted by overly enthused staff members and a surprisingly empty restaurant consisting of only a few patrons sparsely seated throughout the joint. The restaurant was yet another dimly lit eatery with typical chain restaurant decor, nothing really separating itself from other restos in Toronto. I suppose all that really matters in the end is that it was clean and the layout wasn't cluttered - ie. you don't have to weave in and out of tables or bump into people's chairs to get to the washroom.

Our waiter was a friendly guy who had the patience of a saint. Our group was rather large and had some specific dietary requests due to allergies or good old fashioned pickiness so I was impressed by how well he answered all of our queries without showing an ounce of irritation.

For dinner I ordered the smoked meat poutine which was a compilation of house smoked brisket, cheese curds, fries, and pan gravy - topped with a pickle! The overall taste of the poutine was average. It was not the best poutine I've ever had and I thought the fries didn't really taste that fresh. I also thought it lacked in the gravy department because I always think for a poutine to be decent in taste it has to have a french fry to gravy ratio of at least 60:40... This one was probably 20% gravy. Anyway, it wasn't terrible but I expected better especially for $14.

Overall, good service, casual atmosphere, and OK food especially for the price. I only had the poutine so I am basing my food rating on that alone. I would still come back again to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here recently

Hard to get a table here as it's a smaller location

We got a bar table instead

Beer menu is grandeur 

Everything you can think from all over the world!!!!

Had the Czechvar beer and it was quite smooth

Foodwise not bad at all

Had the baked brie and it was quite yummy

Chicken ABT was excellent

Servers brougt our main before our appy and offered to redo our main again which I thought was nice of them

Will definitely come again"}
{"text":"Came here for some pre-curling beers. Huge beer selection. Not too bad."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch and had their mussels and fries. It was really tasty, but the service wasn't that good even though it was not busy at all. It's a good location, but given the service, I'd probably look for another place for an afternoon beer."}
{"text":"Saturday night dinner:
Slow service, not attentive. 

Portions were very small for their price (which would've been fine if the quality made up for it but nope). $19 for a mediocre chicken sandwich (too dry) with fries. Poor vegetarian options -  my friend could only have a salad and it was literally three leaves with a cut up boiled egg -  \"dismal\" was the only way to describe it. 

Everything was very meh. We only came cuz wvrst was full. Two stars for an OK beer but... 

Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I would say perhaps a 3-3.5 for the food, but I'd give it a 4 star rating because Mike F (our server) did an outstanding job tonight.

Came for the Fondue Festival! I've never had cheese fondue before. I was so excited to try it! Came as a party of 4. Managed to order just enough food for all of us to be full (and have like 4 pieces of baguette left over).

Had:

Cheeseburger sliders ($13) - comes with 3 sliders. Supposedly comes with markt frites. Um...my frites, the six to nine of them, were in my sliders. Yeah. I didn't realize they were there until one fell out of Grandpa's slider. These looked decent. They could have been a lot juicier. They were quite dry, even though I believe they had mustard on the buns...or maybe that was the melted cheese. Anyhoo, I only had half a slider and I already needed water to wash it down.

Charcuterie board ($10) - Wednesday special. Usually $16. I got to choose 3 options from their meats and cheeses. I figured we already had enough cheese from the fondue, so I got 3 cured meats. Mike suggested the red chili salumi and the candied bacon. I ended up getting the 18 month Niagara prosciutto, the red chili salumi, and the juniper pancetta. I've never had a charcuterie board before, so I don't have anything to compare this to, but it wasn't foodporn pretty. It looked a tad sparse. I'm pretty sure I know what prosciutto looks like, so I'm going to say it was the pancetta that came rolled up (4 pieces). There were 2 decent sized slices of proscuitto, and 4 slices of salumi (laid flat on the board the way one puts pepperoni on a pizza). The board also had pickles, house mustard, and three slices of grilled bread. Yes, there were grill marks. Out of the three meats, the prosciutto was my favorite. Not too salty. I love the texture of it in my mouth. Yeah. I also really liked their house mustard. It kinda tastes like yellow mustard, but a darker shade (like dijon), and it has a spicy kick to it. I put that mustard on everything tonight. 

Alpine Platter ($37) - supposedly serves 2. Comes with pork schnitzel and accompaniments, fondue, fresh baked baguette, granny smith apples, caraway and rock salt pretzels, markt pickle jar, braised red cabbage, lingonberry jam, sauteed green beans, house mustard, emmental cheese spatzle. That's what the menu says. By process of deduction, the accompaniments were some kind of compote (I asked Mike. He said it was compote) and what kinda fasted like beef jus. Schnitzel was large. Breading was crispy. Pork was juicy. Good job. Lingonberry jam was already on top of the schnitzel. Schnitzel was resting on the cabbage, the spatzle, and the green beans. The braised cabbage was sweet and quite tasty. The green beans were um...green beans. The spatzle was easily the best part of the meal. It's like little chewy (in the best way) bits of pasta. Loved the texture and the taste. If it were a menu item, I'd just order the spatzle. I want to say it's like crack, but I've never had crack. The apples were fresh cut (no icky brown bits here). The pretzel was a tad salty from the salt on top. Thankfully, the pretzel was softer than I thought it'd be. The pickle was interesting (three different kinds - spear was sour, slice was sweet, the small ones were sour as well. The baguette was missing when we got our platter. Thankfully, I checked the menu and then asked where it was. Mike apologized that it was missing and went to get us some. Good amount of baguette. I'm skeptical about its freshness. Fresh bread is usually fairly distinct in aroma. This was not. The outside was a tad hard and over time, it became harder. I kinda wish that they had toasted it up with garlic oil or something. The fondue. Oh the fondue. It tasted good. Not too strong on the cheese. Almost a cheesy alfredo sauce. My big gripe with the fondue was that it was not served with a warmer. My cheese progressively got colder, and it got less and less fun to dip it in. I'm Chinese. I like my food scalding hot. I had visions of dipping my food into molten cheese goodness. This was not it. All in all though, not bad. If we separate the two components (the schnitzel dish, and then the fondue with the various breads and pickles), I see how they got the price of $37. The schnitzel dish is $25 on the menu, and fondue is $12. Perhaps they added extra bread and apples to this two person meal, but other than that, I really don't know how much different it is than ordering the schnitzel meal and a separate fondue.

I'm not used to my servers being so knowledgeable. I very much appreciate it. Mike asked if we were interested in trying a beer and if we were interested in him recommending us one. We weren't, but I overheard him conversing with the table next to us, and I was very impressed. He pretty much asked the lady a few questions, then matched her up with a drink.

I don't know if I'll be back for the Alpine platter (unless they up their cheese game). Perhaps I'll be back for the spatzle. We'll see."}
{"text":"we went in for a quick beer, and ended up making a whole night of it. It was such a lively place. we ended up sharing a 40oz rib steak for 2 people, simply out of this world. it was such a great steak that we already made plans with friends to return. Our server was ver knowledgeable and was able to pair up our meal with a really great beer that we never had. I think it was called left brune. definately comeing back for brunch on the weekend"}
{"text":"Wide beer selection, creative and tasty food menu for a pub and had live entertainment whenever we were there... Didn't tried the indoor part, but it looked acceptable...

Beer sampling was a good experience, pizza looked authentic Italian with a twist (I expected a dull North American style), mussels were decently tasty (they could have presented them better...). 

The host was accommodating despite showing up with no reservation on a busy evening. Our waiter was prompt and well informed on types of beers... That said, the place can do a better job in training its staff not to over do it with casualness (out of no where our waiter jumped into a selfie a friend was taking with his beer sampler, hugged half the people around the table and asked us where are we from!!)

Parking might be an issue... Not an issue for me as it is just around the corner from my building."}
{"text":"Free entry, live bands, and double digit % alcohol beer, what more can you ask for?

As I start to age, I'm detesting the clubbing scene and looking for somewhat happening but laid back place, I'm finding myself more and more often at Bier Market.

Definitely get here before 1030pm if you want to avoid long lines. For some reason they start holding up the line even when the place isn't packed, also you get a lot of line hoppers or people holding a spot in line for like 20 people, it can get pretty frustrating.

For extra good times, order some 10%+ beers, Delirium and a German one which I can't spell nor pronounce (starts with a K).

I like how liberal this place is, some semi-quiet space at the front for people to stand and chat, the mosh pit dancing area for people who want to get down and an easy access washroom path so you're not wading through a crowd like most clubs."}
{"text":"Great location with a nice patio. Service can be a tad slow and food a tad inconsistent, but overall a great place. Obviously if beer is your thing and you want to try something new, this is your place."}
{"text":"Definitely would recommend for those who enjoy a good wurst platter but would not recommend for vegetarians. The vegetarian in my party was confined to a salad. The salads were hearty and very large in serving size, which made them an appealing main. The wurst platter was delicious -- definitely worth a visit if you love sausages with beer. The donuts were very fresh but I wasn't very convinced that the warm espresso dipping sauce was the perfect pairing for them. 

It has a lovely atmosphere but the inside of the restaurant can be a bit warm and we definitely saw a housefly or two, which is understandable, particularly given the patio and the warm weather. There is free parking in front of the restaurant, though you have to be lucky enough to grab a spot (and don't forget to let the hostess know when you come in)."}
{"text":"Useless. Made a reservation for 630 for 6 people and showed up and was told they had no room. No apology no nothing. Absolutely the most annoying experience ever."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of all the Biermarkt locations, purely for the reason of having such an extensive list of beers that is still enjoyable but also approachable whereas some places exclusively focus on the craft and independent brews that can be intimidating to the average drinker. While thats not a concern for myself, when going drinking in groups thats a good selling point, and for that simple fact and also having a patio, this place gets 4 stars.

I've usually ended up at this location on weeknights and its never been overly busy, so one benefit is that I've always been able to get a table, which was a toss up whenever I'd end up at the Esplanade location. I actually think I like the Esplanade interior layout more, but the patio at this King Street location as there is a bit more going on, making for better people watching."}
{"text":"It's pretty hard to argue with a place that has such an extensive list of beers from around the world. Even harder to argue when they have a great multi-page beer menu with write ups of all the brands available which can make the selection process part of the fun. 
Then throw in one of their amazing cheese and lager fondue plates or an order of flatbread and you've got one of the best places downtown for after work drinks. 

Originally I was a bit put off to find out of the places corporate ownership (the same company owns East Side Marios and Casey's restaurants) but given the resources that I'd imagine are required to bring this many brands of beer to one place, I'm willing to look past this.

Food and drink prices are pretty competitive with a lot of the other places on the Esplanade. Best to keep in mind that reservations can be hard to come by, and even finding a seat can be a challenge (or downright impossible) during peak hours... 
But when it comes down to it in the end, this place is very easy to go and have a good time and a cold beer so in Yelp terms, \"Yay, I'm a fan\" sounds about right."}
{"text":"It was totally worth the 20 min wait, in a line that wrapped around the block, at 11:30 on a Friday night, in the friggin' pouring rain ... did I say pouring?  I meant POURING!  Thank goodness for our new friends in line with umbrellas.  Too bad they were tiny umbrellas.

I swear the door-woman has a hatred for people.  It was POURING rain, and she wouldn't let anyone in, even tho' there was hardly anyone inside.  I understand the pretense of keeping a line outside ... blah, blah, blah ... but SERIOUSLY, move the F'N line!

Did I mention how wet I was getting standing in that line?  But, I digress...

It was strangely upscale inside but totally cool.  The beer selection was incredible, I never thought I'd see so many beers on tap.  The crowd was eclectic ... a little of everyone, mostly drunk but who could blame them.  

Expensive beer tho', ranges from $8 to $10, but worth every penny.  Put down that Blue and give it a go!  I never did see a food menu, but I'm hoping there's alot of wurst on there.   Mmmm ... nothing like beer and sausage."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited this spot recently, in order to catch a Raptors game.
Before the game started, there was a live DJ playing good music - we thought that was pretty cool. 
The atmosphere is really open and modern. We immediately felt comfortable and the staff were great. 
I found the menu to lack variety, but I settled for the chicken. Quality and portion of food was amazing!
I will definitely return again to experience the nighttime atmosphere here, as well as the patio."}
{"text":"It was okay. Looked nice. Somewhat overpriced-downtown prices for a suburban location. Amazing beer selection (but alas I am not a beer drinker). 

Its strange to see a downtown joint 'suburbanized'-which means the bar feel of it is lost for more dining options.

The food itself was good, but not overly filling. We shared the charcuterie plate and 2 flatbreads amongst 4 people...it wasnt enough food and by that point we had already spent $50.

Maybe check out the downtown location. I've been to the one on King west and I'm pretty sure its more affordable"}
{"text":"4 stars for beer selection and amazing frites. I'd probably rate it a 3 for a sit-down dinner and a 2 for a \"night out\" of dancing/clubbing. Fortunately I've never tried to entertain hopes at Bier Markt beyond having an awesome beer to start off my night, accompanied by an order of frites. They really are spectacular, and the curry mayo on the side is soooo good. The ambiance inside is chic bistro even though the establishment is quite large. I normally don't go for chains such as these, but I've found Bier Markt a great start to an evening. I did come back to it one night once it had turned into a \"club\" and found it to have underwhelming lighting with kinda crappy music. The patrons were unaffected by these qualities, however.

Bier Markt: great beers on draft, great fries."}
{"text":"The service was not that good. But for beer lovers this place offers lot of variety and food is good as well."}
{"text":"I really like this location more than the Toronto ones which are known for their strict rules of minimum orders of entrees only, not appetizers or a bunch of appetizers, for a group to sit down for dinner. There is also a line up rain or shine and it isn't worth the line up to get into. 

This location has a huge patio (great for people watch and getting some fresh air). they opened at the perfect time, in the midst of summer for their launch. 

I've tried their poutines (all very delicious and savory), flat breads, mussels, steak and several of the beers they have to offer. 

Their selling point for me is the beer selections (try the $20 beer flights to taste a bit of a few well selected beers).

The atmosphere on the patio is great and very fun with good music playing. the atmosphere inside could get over whelming if you are there to talk and not dance. It's extremely loud no matter where you are sitting inside. The dance floor and live stage for bands are both pretty good. 

The servers are great, whether they have to shout or not, they are very friendly and I found much more professional and not snobby like the ones at their downtown locations. 

I go here a few times a month to enjoy their apps and beers with friends. They have a huge parking lot behind the restaurant so its very easy to pull in and go. They have definitely launched themselves to the number 1 spot to hang out in central Mississauga for me."}
{"text":"I was actually quite disappointed at their cheese selections because I was craving cheese for quite awhile. My friend and I chose the Brie and mozzarella but it did not satisfy my cravings and we didn't finish them either. The Brie was quite salty and the mozzarella cheese did not taste like mozzarella cheese at all and was quite mushy! The mussels were also ordered but we thought there wasn't much meat in them. The only thing we enjoyed was our pitcher of sangria which was quite fruity."}
{"text":"Interesting menu but poorly executed. Went there for the duck wings. Super excited because I'm a huge fan of chicken wings...but am now allergic to chicken...too much of a good thing will be your undoing! They were simply \"ok\". The servers are super nice but it took 40 minutes for our food to show up...but these things happen. Most of the 2 star review is for the food anyway. Got the bacon flatbread...yeah it was flat alright. Got the bacon poutine...It was tiny...sooo tiny...and also so underwhelming it should be called \"poo-tine\". Oh and the calamari? More like calamity...actually it wasn't that bad...but still not good."}
{"text":"If you live in Toronto and you have not been drunk at the Bier Markt (such a fancy name) then stop reading this, go there immediately and start ordering Frulis until you can no longer stand on your own two feet.  

The Bier Markt is like the motherland for beeraholics. It has a list of brews twice as long as your arm from every country you've ever heard of (probably). It's located on the swanky Esplanade and has a great huge patio. By day it hopes to be a place of culinary delight but I've never been overly impressed with their food. By night, this place turns into a hedonistic free-for-all with drunken college kids and late 20 somethings dancing and drinking until management cuts off the kegs. 

If you're visiting Toronto, this is great place to go and soak up the flavour of the city. I recommend a Fruli or one of their fruity beers (like raspberry wheat) for a different type of bevvie."}
{"text":"Our waitress was super friendly and very knowledgeable -- she gave us great suggestions about which beer to pair with the food we ordered. The quality of the food is quite good. My dinning companion and I both ordered fish that night -- ahi tuna and salmon -- and both dishes were tasty and the fish was cooked perfectly. However, a word of caution for vegetarians: your choices here are very limited!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid. Nice location and parking. Good wait staff. The menu is great as always and the quality of beer is standarly awesome.

Only issue was that they could not get a steak done medium-well after two tries. It was well done both times. They did comp the meal without asking after the first mistake so there's at least that."}
{"text":"Pleasent decor and staff. The band was alright but too loud for dining.

The Wurst board was a delight, as was the simple but tasty cider fondue.

The wagyu burger was dry and unappealing.

The steak was perfectly seasoned and medium-rare.

The pork schnitzel was breaded perfection with a surprisingly tasty compote.

The shortribs were very underseasoned and fatty.

The creme brule was runny and terrible. Suggest the ice cream bars.

As far as the beer goes, be open to experimentation and you will not be dissapointed. That said, even the Steamwhistle was extremely fresh and tasty.

We'd certainly go back."}
{"text":"Fine selection of beers, heavily focused on Belgians along with solid food options.  Any time I can get a Delirium Tremens, Foie Gras, charcuterie and some decent Poutine I'm in a happy place and that happy place is Bier Markt.  Bier me."}
{"text":"Bier Market is a solid place to enjoy drinks and food with a European twist to it. Although it is Canadian, I really like this concept Bier Market is going for. 

They really focus on their beers here with a large menu of drinks. Fortunately even if you're not a big drinker there's the sampler trio you can go for which is a good deal. I'm not a huge drinker myself but still enjoyed the various new beers I had to try, and appreciated the fact that the waitress told us which order to drink them in.

I really liked their menu here at Bier Market, especially the markt charcuterie boards. There's so many things to try here and all of the items were pretty tasty. We tried some brie, and Gouda cheese, some peri-peri shrimp, some prosciutto, and a slider; we were impressed by most. Serving size is a bit disappointing however. I did really enjoy the various pickles and Dijon mustard on the side, and the toasty bread was also a nice addition for a more complete meal.

We also tried their beet and quinoa salad which was good but lacked some dressing. It could have been a touch more acidic overall, but still a really healthy salad. The last item we tried was their mussels in a Frenchman style which was really good - it was subtle but in a good way in terms of flavors. Creamy with herbs and tomato and garlic and onions which provide some rawness in the sauce. Fries and a bun was also included. Their fries are pretty good - crisp, skin-on, perfectly fried and good size.

We sat on the patio and it was a fantastic vibe. Music wasn't too loud, it was extremely pleasant so I absolutely recommend sitting on the patio! Service was also good with no problems."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening with a group of 8 at around 7 pm and it was quite busy. We got a lot of apps to share. Since it was Thursday, they had a duck wing deal for $14 for 2 lbs of duck wings. Omg these duck wings were cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside and super tender on the inside. It came with a bbq and hot sauce. The duck went goes so well with the bbq sauce. Our party had to order another 2 ordera of duck wings. We also got a large cheese fondue to share and it was amazing. It came with prezels, potatoes and french baguette and the cheese was just so yummy. We also got 2 large sharing boards with 9 items for 45 dollars. The tuna poke was okay nothing special. The chili was sooo good. So spicy and flavourful so it went really well with the toasted bread the board comes with. The fried cheese ball was also very delicious. We got all three sausages to try and it was just wayyyy to salty. But it tasted really good when we dipped it in our cheese fondue. We also got the calamari and shrimp, both were okay. We also got the fried calamari, really soft but I wasnt a big fan of it because it was a bit too soft, theses not much a chew to it. We also got the mac and cheese and it was soooooo salty, dont get it.The beer battered onion rings werent that good. The batter was too thick and it was just way too oily. The sweet potato fries were good and even better when I dipped it in the cheese fondue. At the end with the remaining cheese it became burnt so it was an amazing ending. Im not much of a beer drinker so I couldnt tell if it was good beer. I got a beer flight 6 for $18. It goes well with all the salty and fried foods. Our server was nice and service was good. Ill definitely come back for those duck wings."}
{"text":"I went to T.O. last summer with a bunch of friends, and ended up spending pretty much the WHOLE time at Bier Markt! We were obsessed with the selection of beers they had from all over the world. It's definitely a fun scene on a weekend night with the live band, easy going crowd and all the drinks! They even had this strawberry beer on tap which became my favorite beer that weekend. My second favorite was Sinha, a Sri Lankan beer. 

It was also fun to sit out and bask in the sun the next day and take down a few chilled brews and just people watch on the street. Very relaxing location. Would definitely visit here again some day when I return to T.O."}
{"text":"The good: Great variety of beer choices. Awesome beer menu. Staff is friendly. Lots of people and yet a lot of seating places. Handicap bathroom upstairs while regular bathrooms downstairs (smart). Nice bathroom design.

The bad: Can be awhile before you pay your bill. Can be loud and rowdy. Expensive (8$ to 60$ a bottle).

If you are a beer amateur, this place is for you. You have a lot of variety to choose from and it is a great place to hang out. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"It's not a bad place but it's not somewhere I'd willingly go. I had a sangria and an order of steak with a blue cheese topping. The side of fingerling potatoes were delish and so was the sangria. The steak was disappointing. 

It was a Saturday night so after 11 there was old school hip hop and r&b music playing pretty loud which made the atmosphere more enjoyable but not enough to make us want to stay longer."}
{"text":"Update since we went back a second time. The second visit, the service was excellent and the poutine was the best I've had. Amended the stars as well from three to four. 

1st visit review: The food was fantastic. However, the service wasn't great. Our waiter was great when we came in to explain the concept of the beer pairings but after we ordered and our food came we didn't see him again until we were done.  Granted it was a busy night but we never got refills of anything. But the food was fantastic. I would go"}
{"text":"Since I love their Toronto location I was pretty excited to hear they were opening in Montreal and was super pumped to check it out. What an epic disappointment. We arrived at 6pm on a Wednesday to a seriously overcrowded and ridiculously loud restaurant. We were invited to 'try to find a place to sit' while we waited for our table to become available. The place was SO packed we couldn't even move through the room! Beyond that, the music was at club level and I had to ask the greeter 4 times to repeat what she had said. It was 6pm! TURN THE FLIPPIN' MUSIC DOWN! We waited 25 minutes into our reservation and our table was still not ready with the server telling us the current occupants were 'in no rush to leave'. Well isn't that great! Glad I made reservations! We left and went to Hurley's Irish Pub. I'd like to try this place again but why waste my time when you can't even get your reserved table?"}
{"text":"So we went out of our way to eat here for the second time. They currently have 2 course lunch deal for $17 which features some of their mains that are originally ~$20 each. However, there's an unspoken rule that you must order 2 of those 2 courses since it's meant for 2 people, which was NOWHERE written on the menu. We just opted for the following since there were more options outside of the lunch deal :

Steak & Frites (8 oz. certified Angus NY strip, chargrilled,
Caf√© de Paris butter, \"Bier 58\" sauce, Markt frites)   ~$22 Steak was cooked well. It got cold really fast though. I tasted no beer in the sauce, only butter as mentioned and cooking oil. I found the portion for everything, including the ketchup,  small. 

Markt board (18-month Niagara prosciutto, house-made candied bacon, juniper pancetta, sliced to order, Markt pickle jar, house mustard,
grilled bistro bread) ~ $16. I had this the last time and they would explain what was on the charcuterie board. This time they just plopped it on the table. Mind you the restaurant was pretty much empty. Prosciutto was tougher than last time, pancetta was good, candied bacon was soggy. Pretty inconsistent, since the candied bacon last time was so amazing and was one of the main reasons why I wanted to reorder it. Also the house mustard had no seeds like before either. Boy... things really have cheapened out. The bistro bread was good though!

I'm discouraged from coming back because I felt like I ordered the wrong item, and the one I've re-ordered was nothing like I remembered. :("}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, usually with coworkers for lunch. It's a great spot for some good ol' comfort food like cheese fondue, burgers, and deep fried schnitzel. Their selection of beer is good and they have a lot of different ones on tap.

My staple order is usually the burger although I have had the schnitzel and mussels before (both latter options not very memorable). I always substitute spinach instead of iceberg lettuce on the burger without any problems. Fries are also a must! They are the thicker cut kind. The cheese fondue is good to share if your group is willing. It comes with a selection of pickles, bread, and green apple to dip. Beer battered fish & chips are also delicious! 

One thing that I would recommend you NOT get is the salad. They come in mason jars that get mixed at the table and are on the smaller side. My coworkers who got the salad both regretted getting it as it didn't fill them up, even though they both got extra protein on the side (one got salmon and the other got chicken). 

Service can be hit or miss. Even though it's generally not very busy, we must sometimes flag down our waitress for the bill or to request any extra items. They usually will come by after the food is served to check if things are okay so that's a plus. 

Parking is a bit of nightmare if you come right at lunch. I always find parking but it's usually a bit further away either by the far end of the metro or on the higher levels of the parkade by the LCBO."}
{"text":"Service was slow! Short of staff as it was packed and need to wait too long for refills and all! It was over priced! Portions were small and hubby wanted med well done he got raw steak :-/ Server was unprofessional i didn't like her attitude at all! Im not sure if i liked my experience at all"}
{"text":"Came here on a saturday night around 8pm without reservations, the hostess said it would be about 40 minutes wait luckily it ended up being only about 20 minutes for a table for two. It was during their mussels promotion $11 for a lb of mussels and fries which was a great deal. 

I got the Rosarda Ros√© beer - which was a good price and fruity and also tried a hawaiian beer which was recommended which was light. So drinks were good. 

The mussels however were really underwhelming (or maybe because it was the specials) Got the Provencale - which we were told was creamy and described with herbs - it came as clear plain chicken broth with a few raw diced tomatoes and chunks of raw garlic that was it. Also got the A La Snob flavour with lobster creme - it arrived with barely any (bland) sauce again with the chunks of raw vegetables thrown in. Their burger was not bad a standard burger, the bbq sauce it came with was good - all this took 45 minutes to arrive to the table (the waitress did apologize for the long wait time and gave us some complimentary bread for it)

We paid with a gift card, the waitress took it to the back and tried to deduct from our bill but didn't work (it was an old bon appetite card) The waitress however did not bring back the $25 gift card still full with credit, I didnt realize this until I got home. We contacted the restaurant and they said they would mail us back the card - we received credit back for only Bier Markt Don Mills which I wasn't really pleased about since I don't really want to go back and its only valid for food not even drinks (....so I kind of feel like they took $25 from me...)"}
{"text":"Came here with the girls for dinner and a fun night out. Service was super slow.. We ordered a few drinks and the server completely forgot to put the order in. We waited for 30 minutes before we could flag her down again and asked her about where the drinks were. We ended up just telling her to cancel the drinks and bring the bill. That ended up taking ANOTHER 20 minutes. 

We asked her to split the bill 3 ways evenly, and somehow we all ended up paying drastically different amounts (not sure if she bothered doing the math at all). 

Anyways, wouldn't recommend unless you're just looking to kill a LOT of time."}
{"text":"Celebrated new years here with a party of 8. Provided us with live music and hats/masks and a little place to dance. Perfect calm but fun at the same time environment. Our table was ready on time and the service was great. The restaurant is pricey but the food is definitely good. I always get the schnitzel because it's schnitzel and schnitzel is simply heaven. I also seriously recommend there candied bacon. If you like bacon, which you do because who doesn't like bacon, is a must try! To die for! Beer selection is on point!!! Beers to match your taste. Fruity to bitter, Canadian to German, you name it!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner and drinks with a couple of friends from Holland that were in town in early September. Two of us ordered the fish and chips and the portions were huge, even my friend couldn't finish his. Both guys loved the beer selection - I don't drink beer. We sat out on the patio and service was excellent, street noise minimum, we were there about 8:30 pm to 10:00 pm. All in all a very enjoyable place that I'd visit again."}

{"text":"I've been to this location many many times and have noticed that things recently have gone extremely downhill.
 
I arrived with a friend last night and we sat in the bar area. Let me first say that the hostess working last night was absolutely lovely, and I would be giving my experience 1 star if it wasn't for her. There were a few other tables, but nothing crazy. Apparently our server was busy, so another server came to take our drink orders. She seemed to be very knowledgeable and very friendly, and I could tell she was a senior staff member. We ordered the craft beer sampler. When it arrived, she explained every beer for us which was great. We then ordered 1/2 a dozen oysters to share and I ordered the fish and frites as a main.
 
When the oysters arrived both my friend and I could not get over the incredibly potent fish smell coming from the oysters. We have both ordered oysters many times at different places, and have never smelled even a slightly fishy smell coming off them. We asked the girl who took our drink orders to take them away (we still had not seen our server). She was not apologetic at all and basically just said \"okay\" and took them away. We ordered the gouda bombs instead which were pretty much tasteless.
 
My fish and frites arrived and was good. We had another friend join us, and she must have waited about 20 minutes and nobody came and asked her if she wanted anything. She had to get up and asked to be served herself. When our server FINALLY came she had a horrendous attitude and looked annoyed.
 
Every time we needed anything (water, another drink, hot sauce, etc.) we basically had to ask the hostess because our server was always nowhere to be found.
 
When the bill came I was surprised that they charged us full price for the gouda bombs we ordered and didn't compensate at all for the fact that they oysters they originally brought us were clearly bad.
 
All in all, terrible service (except for the hostess) and mediocre food. I have always liked this location and picked it over other restaurants in the area but I don't think I'll be returning. I'll go to Joey next time."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my Husband's birthday. We decided that instead of making plans to eat somewhere we would wander around and grab a drink on a patio and see where that led us. We happened upon The Bier Markt. There was space on the patio so we sat ourselves. We were greeted promptly and warmly and told it was no problem that we sat ourselves. We were told that so-and-so (female name, I'm so bad with names) would be with us shortly. Sure enough very soon a gentleman (Tony or Fred was his name) came to the table. He joked that he was so new that the hostess doesn't know him. This \"I'm new\" card would be the theme for the rest of the night during or time there. Everything from or drinks taking forever to come (2 pints) to our food taking even longer (an order of sliders as they were the promo of the evening) and half a dozen oysters. To top it off, when the oysters came (before three sliders- figure that out) there were only 5 on the plate. We pointed out to the young man (not our server) who brought the plate to us and he stated\"oh, you ordered 6?\". Yes because that is common and an option on the menu to only order 5 instead of the traditional half dozen. What really put this evening over the top for us was when we went to pay. We decided not to spend anymore time there and asked for the bill. It was brought and we asked for the debit machine. When it was processed, the machine was out of paper. Our server went inside to get paper, or so we thought. We waited, and waited and watched as our server came out with drinks for another table. One of the other servers saw us standing there for sometime and asked how she could help.  We explained we were just waiting for our receipt. She approached our server who appeared annoyed and came by and said \"you guys said you didn't need a receipt!\"  Dude - I get being in the weeds, but don't lie! When he came out with the receipt he was apologetic and threw down the new card again. My Husband and I have previously worked in food service, new doesn't make one a lier."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food isn't the best, but everytime I come, I always have a great time. Their drink selection is HUGE! They have 2 huge patios one for smokers and one for non-smokers. I have neber tried their dessert, but everything else is good to go."}
{"text":"Would never never come here ever again. It's a bar and the door man stop us at the door saying it's a dressy place no jeans and some lady walk out the restaurant with jeans and uggs. And I pointed it out, then he \"kindly\" let us in. As soon as we walk in, 5 hosts were talking to the  counter people for 10 minutes about plans for the holiday...totally ignoring us. Had to cough to get one of their attention. We were offered to be seated at the bar to wait for a table then once again ignored. We did what any customer would do at this point walk out and would never give money to a restaurant who has the worst customer service I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Definitely would not come back here. First off, after giving us water/drinks, it took forever for the server to come back to our table so we could give them our orders. It's lunchtime, we're dressed up - clearly business lunch, wasting our time. There were maybe 3 tables in the restaurant so it wasn't like it was super busy.
Second, the food is pretty terrible. We ordered the 12 oz steak with sides and seafood bowl. The steak were the most terrible quality pieces of meat ever. Probably could have gotten better at a fast food place. The seafood bowl had pasta made of kale - cool concept, except the pasta was all stuck together in the broth at the bottom. The broth was pretty flavorless. Worst part? There were shrimp mussels and scallop in the bowl, the scallops were SOUR. They've had this in storage for way too long. Immediately spit it out.
We didn't bother ordering dessert considering it took forever and another day for them to come to our table. Go to Joey's or somewhere else in the plaza. The best thing at this place is the nice outdoor seating space."}
{"text":"Hmm 2.5 stars. This was my first time here. I did not particularly dislike the place and I am open to giving it another go.
I went here on Sunday night of a long weekend (best night to go out imo) with my boyfriend, my old roommate, and her boyfriend.
We ordered the six beer sampler. My boyfriend and I got the sweet and sour one and I changed 2 of them to Fruili so I could have three LOL (what can I say, I like what I like). It was $20 which I thought was a good deal until I realized the cups are a lot smaller than they look. You're better off with pints.

When the beer samplers came I had two sweet ones and my boyfriend had one which was not so sweet. The next two I tried after that were SUPER bitter. It was then that we realized our server had mixed up our orders. 
No wonder she couldn't explain which were which when she came to our table (she spent a good 10 minutes trying to explain the beers to us when she delivered them).
It took me a while to flag her down and she apologized and brought us two more Fruili beers in the teensy sampler cups.

I ordered the smoked meat poutine ($15). I didn't love it. I didn't hate it either although I prefer Licks' poutine over that one...
The portion size was big. Thank God for my boyfriend or it would have been wasted.
My friends got the smoked chicken flatbread ($12). It was delicious. I loved the brie with lemon!
My boyfriend claims I only liked it because it wasn't mine but I swear that's not true lol!

The band started playing and it was way too loud to have a conversation so we left shortly after that.  It started getting busy around 11.

Oh and at 9pm the bouncer made us wait in line and i.d.ed us and when we got inside it was EMPTY.  He's a tad silly."}
{"text":"Service was really quick but I think the waitress we had was fairly new as she didn't pour my beer properly, ¬º of it was foam and was spilling out of the glass. We usually order the calamari and Gouda bombs with our beers but were disappointed to find out that they don't serve Gouda bombs anymore and the calamari serving has gotten smaller. The calamari is also now served with hot sauce and salad and is cut up into strips instead of the rings as served previously. Probably would just return for the beer but not the food"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Once we walked in the host started off by giving us attitude. Asked if we had reservations, we said no. He told us all the tables were booked but we can sit at the bar. He didn't even bother taking our names and number down to reserve a table. We saw a couple leaving and thought he would seat us there but he just ignored us as we awkwardly waited at the front. Since the bar was already full we just left and headed to joey's instead."}
{"text":"Go to beer here is the peche Mel and it was delicious as usual. If you are feeling hungry the poutine is to die for, there's something about the gravy that made it so unique. Service was excellent despite how busy it was on a Thursday night. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Been here twice.  Not a big fan.  Food is mediocre.  Another Cara Operations restaurant that fails to deliver decent food.  It is marginally better than Taylor's Landing."}
{"text":"Great selection of both bottle and draft beer.  The \"To Start or Share\" menu is great for snack dining family style with friends which is how we ordered this time. The patio table spacing is not to crowded which is nice compared to many other Toronto summer dining venues.    I will back when the re-open in May 2017."}
{"text":"The Bier Markt is accurately named as they offer a good selection of beer while the food is an afterthought. Beer variety is more than enough to find something you are looking for, the drink prices aren't either. The food is where Bier Markt comes up short. The prices are above average for a chain restaurant. However the food is pretty standard fare with not a lot of options. I had the fish and chips were alright. Service was good and they had a nice patio for the summer. Not sure if I would go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch, just got the double burger+fries...The burger wasn't overly huge or anything but was good, I'm not sure but it seemed like the patties were fresh made not frozen which is a plus. Can't complain about the food, service was good though it was quite dead at the time."}
{"text":"I've only ever had one dish here, the market poutine, and it was delicious so I'm giving this place 4 stars... the poutine was that good!

The gravy was a peppercorn gravy with a hint of wine, the chicken was smoked, the fries were nice a golden brown... the more I write, the more I want to go back..."}
{"text":"This place is unfortunate. Their service is good, beer selection great, and has all the food selection I like. The problem is, the food is not good. Their prices make you think it's upscale bar food, ie $20 for a salad, but it's really not. I would rather eat at the firkin or any other bar, at least they don't claim to be great food. 

I have eaten here a couple times, had the burger and the pear/goat cheese salad. The burger is tasteless and overcooked, the pears and cheese was cold and the salad was executed poorly in general. 

This place could be very good with different chefs. It's really too bad."}
{"text":"Omg the veal schnizle was so amazing, the gravy and the tomato jam.... *droolfest* you need to go there. They will do beer pairings with your food, and they KNOW their stuff. GO THERE."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently visited this place while spending a week in Montreal. We loved it - took beer sampler and tried different brews of beers. They also have a great Poutine - gooey french fries full of cheesy and bacon goodness.  Probably loaded with calories, but oh, was it good... They pronounce it over there as [poot'seen].  A must-try ... at least we loved it. It is fairly expensive, and we had to wait longer than we would expect.  However it did not appear to be a systematic thing - there was a huge group which kept our waitress on her toes."}
{"text":"Went back on a not too busy Wednesday winter evening. Started off with featured beer ... Mill Street and it was quite good and was a  recommendation.  Tried the chicken wings which looked crispy and well done. Then tried the cheeseburger sliders which were delicious. About the only thing this place needs more servers I guess."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Tried the veal schnitzel, mushroom risotto and the burger. The schnitzel was great and the burger was good. But the risotto was not very good. It was a bit dry and not creamy and the rice was not cooked very well. The sauce was flavorless. They do have a great selection of beers and the staff was nice.

Food: 3.5/5
Price: 3.5/5
Atmosphere and staff: 4/5
Overall: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Two words: BAD SERVICE! In my TOP 5 WORST Service Experiences. 

Came here with friends for a holiday get together. We made reservations for 14 people and confirmed this with the restaurant. Knowing this, they gave us a table that can fit 8-10 max and to figure out how to sit the remaining people ourselves. We couldn't even get chairs! Waitress was so unhelpful, all I heard was \"no i cant..no, sorry...unfortunately, no..\" ... you get my drift. I would provide a name but she wasn't wearing a tag and actually, everyone was basically unhelpful. I managed to get 1 extra chair after asking repeatedly. I inquired to the waitress AGAIN, a staff member (who said she would find someone to help but never did) and finally a hostess (who must have sensed I was getting frustrated and might have asked for a manager if I didn't get my chairs).

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the company, food and music. Just not the service. I know we were a big group but I think the tip would have made up for the hassle? Also, there were so many extra chairs lying around I just wanted to grab one myself. I guess they were just trying to save them to fit in as many paying customers as possible. Though some of the chairs were still empty when I left the place. Anyway, whats more frustrating is that they wanted us to coat check too, charging $3 per coat and $5 if you place it together with someone. Sorry but this seemed like a rip off to me, its not a club but a restaurant & bar. I would assume that would be complimentary and if not, at least given as an option. Not basically forced to do it so we can have enough room to sit.

I am not totally writing this place off because everything else isn't bad. The food, beer and band are okay. Band played later then expected though, started around 10:15pm instead of 9pm. I had the Market Poutine $13 and Fruli Strawberry Wheat Ale $6.42. Both which I liked and would try again. The poutine was very filling and the ale was almost sweet as juice. If I ever do come back, I might try the Delirium Tremens Ale $7.74. I recommend trying this place only if you are in the area and in the mood for pub food. However, come with very low expectations! Perhaps you will have better luck then I.

It gets really noisy and crowded later though, so not ideal for any romantic dates or meetings. Dress Code: No hoodies but a sweater and jean outfit should be fine."}
{"text":"The beer variety is amazing, the staff is friendly and the candied bacon poutine is out of this world. 

I had a burger on my first visit and it was slightly overcooked and a little tough. Went a second time (mostly for the beer and poutine) and had the chicken schnitzel and that was much better prepared. My wife had a candied bacon Caesar salad and it looked really good. 

The beer menu is so big that you can't help but visit again just to check beers off the list. I will personally stay away from the sour beers forever but if I didn't visit this place I would not have known that."}
{"text":"Don't get the burger. A few people in our group ordered it including myself and it can out burnt and disgusting. The beer also took a long time to be brought to the table. I heard the schnizltle was good though. Chris ordered the tuna burger and he thought it was going to be raw but it cooked. We also went to watch the Celtics game and they had soccer on the big screen. Odd. Kyle also got lost with Chris after and ended up at a hooka bar."}
{"text":"Impressive selection of beers on tap and in bottles and good service, but I'm not sure I'd go back. Yeah it's probably better than the place it replaced \"On the Curve\" but food wasn't fantastic (I had some sort of really bland flat bread thing) and I still think that West 50 has a better selection on draught. 

That being said, it still is an impressive list and our server (Mona I think?) was more than knowledgeable and basically read my mind as to what I wanted (I didn't even know). It was some Belgian brew with an elephant logo (I love elephants) and she was even nice enough to bring me an extra coaster to take home as a souvenir.

The atmosphere is nice enough, although a bit muddled...is it an old-timey pub or a sports bar or what? I didn't quite get it. 

Anyways, decent enough and I see no reason to not come back, although there are plenty of other options in the area and I'm not sure that the Bier Markt stands out enough for me to make it a semi-regular stop."}
{"text":"Came here for my husbands bday the other day. Great place for a drink. They confirmed our reservation before we came. Ordered their passion fruit cider and it was my favourite drink so far. Came back with my husbands friends on a Saturday night when they had live music. The music was very entertaining but place was packed so service was not good. Took the waitress a while to take our order and told us that the kitchen is closing in 10 min so we ordered drinks only"}
{"text":"Came here for a pre-game drink when the Habs were playing the Rangers.  It was packed.  Surprisingly, about half the folks were Rangers fans.  Bummer!  Regardless, I made some new Quebecoise friends and we chatted in my very rudimentary French.  Yay!  

They have pages and pages of beer.  Unfortunately, they had NO cider at all!  I get it - it's a beer market, but still, would be fine to have at least ONE cider option among the hundreds of beer options available.  Service was good.  Easy place to stop in before a game."}
{"text":"Oh Canada.

You are hilarious. You and your state sanctioned beer stores. Alas, I was taken here by my dear friends, who are Canadian. I loved the vast selection of beer, the oodles of good and delicious food (oysters in Toronto? why yes...yes they are good).

Oh Mac and Cheese, you are good. Oh beer. Anyway, I like your bier."}
{"text":"ordered a flight of beers which took an agonizingly long time to serve...without head...little flat and tasteless..."}
{"text":"Do not eat here.

This place is for beer drinking only. The beer is good and the 1 litre glass is $10. The ambiance, decor are good for a sports bar. The high chairs start to get annoying/uncomfortable after awhile.

Avoid their burgers like the plague. The burgers are burnt (both the meat and the bread) and bland. Afterwards, I spent a better part of the night trying to get rid of the nasty aftertaste. The price for the burger was outrageous-$20 for a nasty burger and small sweet potato fries.

Go to watch the game/hang out with friends and drink beer, but don't eat there!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest service I've ever experienced... 

I've been to this location twice... The first time I waited over an Hour for my food order, with an empty restaurant.. 

The second time I ended up just walking out after waiting 25 minutes without service from any of the staff... Even after stopping and asking for help I was told \"we'll be right with you\"... Which never happened.

My advice: go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We've gone to here twice while visiting Montreal. They are very accommodating especially since we usually have a large group. I honestly can't remember what I ordered the first time,  but I really nailed it on my last trip. I ordered a steam pot with poutine fries. Excellent! Seriously I think I was the envy of a few of my friends. I've had poutine before and so far wasn't impressed, but Bier Markt's version is pretty great. I'm glad I gave it another chance. 

One of friends ordered a schnitzel and it came out almost like a heart. I know that has nothing to do with anything, but it was very cute. They have an impressive beer list and I was even able to find a few that I liked. I highly recommend meeting your server know what you typically drink and letting her custom make a beer flight. I really liked the strawberry beer although most of my beer drinking friends said it was too sweet. Both times the service has been good even though they are always very busy. I'm sure we'll be back next year."}
{"text":"Been here many times, and it always gives me very mixed feelings.  In some ways each night out there is a battle between great beer and all the really poor aspects.

The good:
- Great beer list
- Really great beer list

The poor:
- Staff are generally not knowledgeable or interested in your order - I've many times been given wrong information, been poorly served (e.g. no glasswear provided for a strong, darker beer with foil covering), or not served at all (waiting 15 minutes at the bar to get an order in)
- Atmosphere completely contrasts with the drinks menu - feels/sounds much more like a downscale meat market than somewhere to appreciate the variety of beer on the menu
- Bouncers are, in general, giant jerks

I might add that my poor impressions aren't based on one bad night out - I have been here numerous times, although rarely go anymore.  Bottom line is that if you're going out with a large group and want a club-like atmosphere, it could be good.  If you're looking for somewhere to try a lot of beers and have a conversation, stay away and go to BeerBistro, Volo, C'est What or Smokeless Joe's instead."}
{"text":"Over 150 choices of beer from over 30 countries...the type of bar that has been needed in the downtown area for a while! Atmosphere is great and the food is awesome."}
{"text":"Since in Ontario there seems to be a naming game of the obvious, as I thought it was funny that they named a place they sell beer, The Beer Store, I was hesitant to go to the \"Bier Market\". I imagined I was going to be brought to an actual market. 
But...I absolutely love this place. It's the perfect cure for when you want to go out somewhere, be surrounded by people, but you don't want to stand out in a crowd. You know when you are trying to decide where to go for the night with your friends? Bier Markt is the answer. If you do end up getting tired of the scene, well at least you would be walking out with a full belly and a light buzz off their good beers. 
I, myself, am not a big beer drinker, but I tried a few of the fruity beers ( I highly recommend the strawberry over the raspberry one) and they were extremely good and both had a hint of a light rosee colour. 
I was there with co-workers and we shared for appetizer the poutine, which was made with braised beef short ribs and roquefort cheese. For a Germanic take on this Quebecer fav, it wasn't too bad. I would've preferred more sauce and bit more meat, and perhaps they could've let down on the salt a bit. 
We did have to wait for a table since it was a Saturday night and there was a major hockey game on. But if you are there with a good group, you don't mind to chit chat and sip on drinks while you wait. 
The ambiance is good too. It's slightly underground, which instantly makes you feel a bit cozier, and the crowd was a mix of twenty-somethings and thirty-somethings. 
I can see how some people might get tired if you go there constantly, but I would consider it more along the lines of comfortable. And everyone does need a change of pace though once in a while, don't we?"}
{"text":"On a cold winters night vacation from California, we yelped \"IPA's\"and came upon this place. What a wonderful surprise. That bartender was so sweet and the IPA amazing and the cheeses and smoked meets we're outstanding. Would definitely return whenever we come back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Went there for a dinner with friends. Very nice place. Nicely decorated. Clean. The french onion soup wasn't good. Too salty, not much cheese. But the Fish & Frites were delicious as well as the tuna hamburger.  The portions were large. Don't drink beer, but they had lots of choices. The service was friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Great casual place for food and beers. There  are 2 floors of sitting areas, a massive list of beers with a highly descriptive menu, and a nice food menu to match.

We shared a cheese and meat board to start and I went for the moules et frites, one of my favorite dishes ever and a few Mad and Noisy IPL's. There were various options for the mussels, I went for the classic proven√ßale but my colleagues tried different ones and everyone was happy. They also had a nice variety of flamkuchen and poutines. The prices were very reasonable for the quality and amount of food"}
{"text":"Great service and a wicked bier selection. I only know one other place in Toronto with Pilsner Urquell on draft. Who knew a little hot spot in Etobicoke with a live band."}
{"text":"Came by yesterday with a couple of friends to enjoy the semi-warm weather on the patio. Our host was very accommodating when we asked to move tables due to the possible attendance of a friend with a dog. Our server was a gentleman in which I didn't catch his name but he was very friendly, helpful and personable. At one point he hadn't check in on us in a little bit and apologized profusely saying they had a little team meeting, which we had no issues with. We joked with him about his mostly positive feedback from managers and he even said how much he appreciated that his managers understood what serving was actually like and not an outsider Thinking they know. Anyways, he was really great and please share the kind words with him (patio, Sunday Oct 1st, around 5:30pm.) Thank you for the hospitality, great wine deal, and great food!"}
{"text":"Good hangout. Plenty of Bier to try and very decent food. I really don't mind this place"}
{"text":"Saturday we thought we would try this place out as my coworkers had recently been for supercilious and said it was good. When we arrived the space allocation was strange and well gapy. There were seating areas crunched together with large open spaces empty. Our server was ho-humm and I felt like everyone was sitting on top of each other. I could hear the conversation of everyone around me but not the person I was with. We were both frustrated. When the food arrived we were further disappointed small portions for nothing exciting with a higher than average price. I am certain to not try this place again."}
{"text":"Live music on a Saturday night. Was offered free coat check as well. Drinks took a while to be served though, which is good in a way as it means people want to order drinks here. Nice hangout spot!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for my bachelor party of 18 people weeks in advance. Made follow up phone calls to verify and confirm they could accommodate a group of our size. Upon arrival we were led upstairs to a nice table beside the upper bar and although all appearances looked positive it went downhill from there. 35 mins to get water served to the table, almost an hour for alcoholic drinks to arrive and food perhaps 2 hours. The adjacent table of 15 were served before us which was maddening. Manager was clueless and after speaking to him for an explanation he did nothing for us. Appetizers & Entrees came out at staggered times making things difficult. The $100 Tomahawk steak arrived overcooked and was sent back. My ribs arrived cold. Our server, although nice, was serving multiple other tables and could not keep up. Server dropped a wine glass which shattered all over my friend arm but no apologies given or concern. I was embarrassed to bring my party of 18 here."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio with a couple of friends and hardly noticed the time fly by.  Food, company, drinks were all good... only problem was the bill.  Definitely some sticker shock considering only two of us ordered entrees... the total came to $80/person or something unreasonable considering the quantity of food and drink we had.  In any case, it should be mentioned that I am not a beer drinker and I quite liked the Czech beer that the server recommended.  Also noteworthy is the cured meat platter we ordered, which was expensive but quite tasty."}
{"text":"We're from California. Stopped here for charge and to eat. Excellent! Food and service on a nice Saturday."}
{"text":"Oh gosh please save yourself $50+ and DO NOT GO HERE. I ordered a hamburger on the grounds that it's something that is hard to mess up. Of course, it cost $17 and came dry and chewy with rubbery pieces of *something* that could not possibly be beef throughout. Of course, the serving of fries was impressively tiny. The burger was also cold. I sent it back. I wish the second one was better, but it wasn't. Why do these restaurants exist?"}
{"text":"Awesome selection of hard-to-find beers (try the Westmalle Dubbel and Tripel.) Food is expensive but generally very good. The mussels aren't worth their high price."}
{"text":"In my opinion, service was great. The hostess did an excellent job welcoming us and 
informing the newbies about how the Beer Menu works and offered her recommendations without hesitation. The waitress was friendly & helpful but I would say that her service did dip a little after our initial drink + app order.  She could have been more attentive, available and prompt in terms of bringing drinks + requested items. 

Ambiance was excellent until the live band started playing. The music was absolutely too loud to hear each other :( On the plus side, the rock band was off the chainz! Trove's performance was outstanding and the crowd really enjoyed them. Apparently this location is just starting to offer live music on Thursday nights (around 8pm) so I hope they learn from this experience and lower the volume next time.  I mean it was louder than most bars and clubs I've been to... some diners just left.  Lesson learned, maybe. 

Decor is gorgeous. Patrons dressed chic and quite easy on the eyes... was a little caught off guard lol.  That's a good thing :) Glad I opted for that chic yet sexy blouse and not the sweater when I was choosing my outfit! Men looked hot but I noticed most of their eyes were fixated on the men at our table LOL. I was convinced this location was a favorite of the 'Sauga Gay/Bisexual community -  which I have no qualms about! Just a word of advice - dress to impress :) Ladies were hot too which I certainly don't mind as well :) 

If it weren't for the amazing food,  I would have rated this experience a 3 star. Pretzel Calamari, Chicken Soup, Bier Markt Wings were really impressive and uniquely flavoured. The best apps I've had in a long time :) 

I'm not a huge lover of beer but I do love Fruili and the Somersby Cider the Hostess recommended to me :) Would love to try the sweet & sour flight next visit :)  OK there's too many smilie faces in this review - clearly, that's a good sign! The Bartender also did a fantastic job on my friend's Double Amaretto Sour - wow! That's my new drink! (smilie face omitted... trying to restrain myself here lol) 

All in all,  it was a memorable foodie AND music experience and I can't wait to return to this location & check out others. The summer patio I'd going to be fabulous! Cheers to losing my Bier Markt virginity!!"}
{"text":"With an impressive list of beer this is a solid choice to sit back and relax.  It's in the Shops of Don Mills so if you get a chance to sit outside it's always interesting to people watch as it's pretty interesting on weekends...or actually any night since this area is pretty busy.

I had the Somersby Cider which was lovely and the Gouda bites (deep fried gouda balls essentially) which were nice to snack on..but I don't think were worth the $11.  

They have live music on certain evenings and specials through the week.  The service was decent but then again we were there around 5:30pm so it wasn't super busy..as we were leaving around 7pm it started to fill up.  The place is big inside and can accommodate up t about 50 people outside but if you are going with a group on the weekend definitely make reservations."}
{"text":"Overpriced, mediocre food. Only thing I ever liked here is the oysters and live music. I don't drink beer so their beer selection is nothing to my interest. People seem to go here as the alternative if Joey's around the corner is packed."}
{"text":"The appetizer boards are a nice idea, touch..
I don't drink beer, so I can't comment on that.
The waitress was really helpful, friendly.
The 12oz steak was good, $35, pricey for the amount served.
The interior could use some modernization.
Was asked about 8 times how things were by about 5 different employees, overkill."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night after a long flight into the city. The service was pretty awful - it took about 20 minutes for someone to \"notice\" me at the bar, then a couple of more passes before they actually took my order. I had the pork ribs which came with cole slaw and fries. The ribs were tasty but dry. I looked at a few other plates and they looked more appetizing than mine. The beer selection looked awesome. But I'm a vodka type of pup. The big screens broadcasting sports would make this a game night pick...except for the DJ conveniently blocking the big screen. Go at your own risk."}
{"text":"So I finally tried the beer market !
I came to the Sherway location and I have to say I enjoyed myself ! 
I only ordered some apps one being a pretzel the other a sampler plate and a friend some slider burgers. It I have to say they were all very tasty ! 
Huge awesome selection of beers . And service was good our waitress was pleasant . 
It's a good place to meet some friends for beers and have a chat !"}
{"text":"Came to the sq 1 location on a Saturday night 
Wow was it ever busy ! Pretty good crowd as it seemed ...we got a few apps and they were tasty .
Lots and lots of beer selection .
Servers were nice and friendly and prompt ! 
I'd come back for sure !"}
{"text":"We were here this evening with a group of 12 people.

Pros:
The beer list is long, so just about anything you want is available (Fruili - check!)

Cons:
1)  Reservation made - we were threatened that they would cancel our reservation if we were late.  The restaurant was pretty EMPTY.  Threats not required.
2)  Service - slow, the server hardly came by
3)  Food:  Poutine was extremely salty, the burger was ok, the flatbread was ok (if the review was based on food alone, the rating would be 3 stars at best).
4)  Food and drinks were pricey for what we received.
5)  Server and Manager held up our table from settling up the bill for over 30 minutes over $6.  And the server kept rolling her eyes at our table.  Not CLASSY at all.
6)  On larger groups, they include a standard gratuity of 19% on your bill - SUPER NOT CLASSY, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU RECEIVE SUB-PAR SERVICE.

I would only go back to sit on the patio and have a drink, otherwise this place is a major FAIL.  The cons far outweigh the pros.

As other people have noted, head to Joey's next door, if you're in the 'hood."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*
We were here last week.  I came with a few gf's.  It was nice to have a night out.  We were seated in the girls section...actually I don't think there is a girls' section but there was a big group of ladies on one side of us, and a smaller table of ladies on the other.  It's pretty busy here, my friends probably spent about 20 minutes at the bar before we were seated.  It's pretty loud here too, so it was tough to hear my DC's.

We ordered the fondue (the beer one, not the cider one).  It was so good.  We also had the snitzel (to share).  And ended with the seasonal creme brule.  The fondue was definitely a highlight.  the Snitzel was ok, the creme brule was really more like a chocolate pudding with a hard-ish shell on top.  The \"macaroons\" that came with it were weird.  The cookie part was salty, and rock hard.  It was difficult to tell if they meant it to be that way, or if the chef accidentally used salt instead of sugar to make them.  They were sad little macarons.

I'd come back for beer and fondue, but probably skip dessert.  It was ok, but certainly not what they described it as."}
{"text":"In the heart of Shops @ Don Mills, The Bier Markt serves up all kinds of beers from across the world... I think over 180 different beers.

They have an all new updated menu!
Tried their pork schnitzel with cheese spackle (sp?) and onion rings, and a side of Palm beer.

For those who've never tried pork schnitzel, it is a pounded piece of pork that's breaded and deep fried. It is similar to the Taiwanese style of deep fried pounded chicken that's as big as your face. Bier Markt offers it in chicken as well.  Although schnitzel is traditionally offered in veal, it is not available here. It ain't cheap, at $24 for the scnitzel + 2 sides and a sauce. I chose the gravy and it was delicious.

Service is kind and attentive. The atmosphere is dim and modern, and not terribly noisy.

Parking, though free, can be a nightmare depending on the time that you go.

Overall, they stepped up their food game. A couple years ago, I wouldn't eat here because it was mediocre food for a high price."}
{"text":"The old Bier Markt is always a staple if you are looking for a great night out!

I was just there for my best friend's birthday last weekend and again, I was amazed by the energy and life this bar has to offer on a Saturday night.

What makes Bier Markt great is they have tons of bar space spread out all over the place, along with tons of tables for group dinners - a perfect addition to anyone's birthday party or celebration occasion.

On top of that, they always have great cover bands and DJ's busily spinning in between each set.

The only thing I have to warn about is the menu is limited in terms of food selection and every entree starts at $20 and goes up from there.

Also, if you are having a big group for dinner, make sure your reservation is in the clear and that your table will be ready when you get there."}
{"text":"Yes, the service is sub- par, but they have great selection of beers. The food is also good, especially for a bar. My favourite is veal schnitzel, and mussels.

Service: 1 stars ( can they be even slower?!)
Atmosphere: 5 stars
Food: 4 stars"}
{"text":"Ce soir, je devais assister √† une conf√©rence au Sheraton √† c√¥t√© et j'avais 30 minutes pour manger. Je suis donc all√©e au resto le plus pr√®s, en l'occurence le Bier Markt. 

Staff efficace, dynamique et attentif √† mes besoins (c'est-√†-dire manger VITE pour arr√™ter de me plaindre que j'ai faim et que la vie ne vaut plus la peine d'√™tre v√©cue parce que mon estomac est vide) et √† ceux de mon accompagnatrice (lire ici: stagiaire).

J'ai command√© la poutine au bacon confit, parce que BACON + POUTINE.

{"text":"Was here Saturday aft for brunch.  Had steak and eggs, and French toast.  Food very good, service not bad.  Friends had schnitzel on waffles, French toast, beet salad. All enjoyed the meals.  Enormous selection of beers from around the world.  The clear away a lot of the tabes at night and is more like a bar/nightclub, with either live music or a dj, ie the are currently doing a \"vinyl Wednesday\" night.  Liked the place a lot and if I lived closer would come more often"}
{"text":"What can I saw! This place is amazing. I flew to Canada to see a buddy of mine and he brought me here. I will be forever grateful! The beer selection and food is great!  It's a mix of a bar/lounge, but let me just mention this...they have cognac beer! Wow! The beer, the food and the waitress were amazing! Check this place out if you are ever OT in OT! Sheila was amazing hope she's still there!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here last night for a late dinner. We headed to the bar section and found table seating in prime bar real estate. Neither one of us are beer drinkers, but this establishment has an excellent world wide selection that we were able to choose favourites from past trips. She chose a Belgium beer (with hint of raspberries) and I chose the Hobgoblin English ale. Ah, it was an excellent choice! 

We ordered the sliders, frites and cheese platter. We had quite the sumptuous dinner I must admit. The sliders were moist and satisfying. I have come to the conclusion that I can no longer enjoy a burger because it's too much food. The slider is just the right amount of burger for me. In hindsight, we could have shared the frites but from previous networking experiences, I am always served small platters of frites that I made that mistake in ordering. Nevertheless, the food was delicious and satisfying.

I love cheese and the idea of pairing it with beer is a nice concept that to my uninformed mind, has been going around for ages!  Apparently, the cheese bring out the flavour of hops because they are complementary, having the same origins (grass).  In some ways, it reminded me of the ploughman's lunch I had in the UK, and maybe next time, I will stick to only the cheese platter to truly enjoy the flavours.

The atmosphere itself is very alive and fun, no doubt aided by live music (cover band) and the beer flowing from the tap!  The sights around were easy on the eye (no need for beer enhancement), and the service was friendly, helpful and efficient. I felt very comfortable in this establishment. I had this silly notion you had to be a beer snob/drinker to truly enjoy it but it's not true. 

A fun time was had by us, and we will surely be visiting this spot once again."}
{"text":"Food and drinks can be delicious but careless, inattentive service will diminish the experience.  It took 30 min to receive the bill. We arrived here after our 10km hike. It was a great way to finish the hike. We had great conversations. 

They have refreshing fruity beers. I love those the best, especially after a 10 km hike!"}
{"text":"Is writing a review for The Bier Markt a bit like setting the bar too low?

When I first arrived at this fine establishment years ago, it was a work function. I was impressed by the cavernous hall at the end leading to the small stage. The rest of my work mates were at home. I was woefully self-aware.

Fast forward to last summer. The most recent time I was here.

The patio has undergone an upgrade. It is a wonderful spot to share a charcuterie board and a fruity beer.

We built the charcuterie with the gouda bomb, stilton and the goat cheese; the sausage, prosciutto and the coppa. It was a divine and satisfying combination."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place but I find myself here more often than I would like. My friends love this place but I don't share the same love. The beer here is amazing, such a large selection from all over the world. Prices are reasonable and the food is good but a little pricey for what you are getting.

The decor feels like a regular pub. Noting special. Lots of beer signs, dark wood, booths, 2 bars, and some other things that make this place generic. Some nights you get a really fun crowd and other nights you get a lot of pretentious douche bags from the financial district coming this way.

Waiting to get a table can suck as this place gets really busy. The atmosphere and waitstaff aren't anything special either. Sometimes they are very rude when they are busy, sometimes they don't show up, sometimes you don't get a server, sometimes the bartenders are douches. But that is only sometimes. If you've been here as many times as I have you will experience those sometimes but usually they are nice and knowledgeable. 

Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone from out of town so they can get beers from all over the world. Also to anyone that like to drink a lot of beer. The beer is the star here. Food is good but pricey."}
{"text":"Our party of 18 arrived at 615 and after waiting a half hour our overwhelmed and in impressive waitress finally came around for our food orders. It took over two hours for our food to arrive. At no point did pour waitress come to our table and apologize for the inexcusable wait time. The absentee manager never came to our table and we had to track him down regarding the status of or meal and when we finally located him he gave a hollow and meaningless excuse that it is busy tonight. If their management staff is under the impression that waiting two hours is acceptable then the root of the problem starts from the top down. If you like tourist traps with overpriced beers and subpar wait staff then this fraudulent beer garden is right for you. I am writing this review at our table and it's 930. The waitress is no where to be found and our glasses are as empty as our patience as this hoax of a beer garden."}

I have two perspectives - I worked in the industry for many years and I'm also an avid diner with a vested interest in the success and proliferation of as many restaurant options as possible. 

My first post, unfortunately, turns out to be about one establishment that might be taking up space where others could flourish. Not how I wanted to begin but honesty is key!....\"

{"text":"Not too impressed but really great selection. A bit pricey but if you want to try beer from all sorts of places including narnia, this is the place to go. 

Got the schnitzel and meat and cheese platter. Both were actually really good, but super over priced. 

Waited for a patio seat for 30 minutes, and when we got there apparently we were the first ones in line for a patio seat. 

Server was nice but could of been a bit more attentive. Couldn't blame her since it seemed like they had little staff working the Friday I went. 

Overall it was decent, but I probably Solent go again."}
{"text":"Great experience here.  Huge beer list.  Tried a fun one, and it was great, to boot.  Attentive service.  Heard the daily specials were good, so tried the Chicken Pot Pie for dinner.  It was great!"}
{"text":"It's busy - like packed busy, so something draws people.  Don't trust those people. There are loads of bars in the city to go get a drink and hang out.  This is the type of  joint I'm glad exists because it' acts as fly-paper for the empty-headed and thoughtless."}
{"text":"Great schnitzel. Sub-par service (you have to go hunting for somebody to serve you). Internet reaaaalllyyyyy sucks."}
{"text":"I have been to this Bier Markt location for few times.  Mostly because my bf suggested.  We also go to the King West location.  Bier Markt carries extensive beer list.  My favorite fruli and grapefruit radler are always available on tap.  I have no problem with it at all.

To their drink menu, I am totally satisfied.  Yesterday, we came and my bf wanted oysters.  It was $3 each regular price.  We ordered a dozen but at least 4 to 5 of the oysters were like a size of a quarter (25 cents) or not much bigger than a quarter.  They were fresh but we were sort of disappointed especially we paid regular price.  The so-called pretzel calamari was a total disappointment.  They were simply deep-fried calamari and bland.

Glad that our Yelp buddy ordered the candied bacon and potato flatbreads.  Guess we should stick with flatbreads next time.

The service here was friendly.  Our server came and checked on us several times, but our plates full of oyster shells had never once replaced.

Will I come back?  Yes, for a drink and the patio."}
{"text":"Brutal service etiquette, & disappointing food-- yeh, I get this is a busy location, as are most restaurants in Toronto on a Saturday night......maybe get more servers? 
so the the one's you have aren't crabby & take 30 minutes to even acknowledge a customer's presence? 

After being graced with a moment's attention to place our order, it took forever to get our food & drinks......& we ordered oysters & beer, not much prep there. 

After sitting there as long as we did, we figured we'd just indulge & have a good night regardless of how long we waited for everything, why be sour about it & ruin a night? -- BUT our oysters hadn't been shucked properly ( even after all that time ) so we consistently found shell bits........:/ 

The server & the manager did nothing to compensate for a terrible night of waiting around & then failing at even providing a meal worth waiting for.

Thanks for nothing but poop Bier Markt -- even our drinks sucked."}
{"text":"Had lunch here Monday,beer selection was awesome,actually found some excellent ones at very reasonable prices.Had the wings as an appetizer then the steak and frites for my meal...wings were good,though I've had better,have to give 5 stars to the steak and frites..steak was very flavorful and cooked as ordered....Only negative was the bartender,although very polite,was a little slow on our drink orders...I'll definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Here is probably the best way to describe Bier Markt

Service: 5/5 - Although the server was new, he did a fantastic job also the bartender was very friendly. 

Quality of Food: 4/5 - The short-rib and Cheddar was amazing. Something you have to try!  The veil was 'ok', not seasoned but the dressing was pretty good! So it did complement each other. 

Temperature of Food: 4/5 -  Although they forgot to bring my friends food. They just opened, so they are probably still working on some stuff 

Value of Meals: 3/5 - The price of the meals are reasonable. They have a HUGE selection of beers. But remember the soft drinks are NOT refillable. 

Atmosphere: Casual and you can enjoy a conversation. 

Would I Return: Yes

Time of Meal: Late Night Dinner"}
{"text":"Yes, Bier Markt has a great beer selection, but that's pretty much all the Queensway location has going for it. The two times I've been the service has been subpar. Last Saturday when I was there, the waiter took at least 15 minutes just to acknowledge that we were sitting there, even though he was serving nearby tables. It wasn't terribly busy. The food is okay. I had a poutine the first time I went and eggs benny the second time. If you are gonna drop by and visit, I'd recommend eating the eggs benny or chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I had a really great time here. She lived in Germany for a summer and was very pleased with the beer and food selection. The service was great and the poutine sampler was off the chain. But, we're from Chicago, so we know nothing about poutine."}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome. The live music here was incredible, and apparently the night we went the guy playing was even Juno Nominated...Pretty damn good! What can i say the selection of beer or \"bier\" they had was humongous, and was so hard to actually choose. Luckily they had this awesome special for a nice variety of different types of beer such as your wheats, or hops etc. I chose the Wheats, and it was great, came with quite a few samplers for about 20 bucks, leaving you pretty damn good/tipsy afterwards (I'm a lightweight though). And the smoked meat poutine was also amazing, great food, great drinks, all you need is friends and its a match made in heaven!! Had a blast here, I will return again one day!

CHEERS!"}
{"text":"After a long day of work and an early dinner...the night was still young and I needed an adult bev!  A fellow co-worker suggested Bier Markt...which I thought was literally a beer market...until I looked it up.  

Yeah, much more than a store selling beer, it was a mecca of beer for individuals who fancy themselves as beer connoisseurs.  Since i already had plenty of food, I only stopped here for bevs...but did look through the food options (which seemed to be tasty) and saw an cooler filled with charcuterie...again, looked #amazing.  

*Grimbergen Dubbel Abbey Ale 
*Hazelnut Brown Nectar 

Can't begin to describe the flavors of each beer, both are different, unique profiles, different finishers...simply great tasting, flavorful craft beers.  

Go online, peruse their online beer menu, bring a group of friends to enjoy a nice evening of craft beer and great convo."}
{"text":"We had to sit a t the bar inside to wait for a table on the patio. It was a gorgeous day to sit outside and have a cold one. I did't mind the wait but it sure was dark and dingy in there. Loved the peeing boy fountain at the entrance. Tres a propos! 
We had a Honkers Ale by Goose Island Beer Co. from the encyclopaedia of beer menu. Our knowledgeable server helped with the selection. Much appreciated. 
We had panko crusted pork schnitzel in a Leffe Brune Abbey demi glaze and topped with a colourful dollop of lingonberry jam, and the 72 hour short rib also glazed with Brune Abbey Ale falling off the bone delish. Generous portions! Go there hungry."}
{"text":"A varied brunch menu available until 4pm.  √úber-extensive beer list.  Kid friendly during the day, live and loud music at night.

The beer list, as impressive as it may seem, is subject to restocking availability, and I have yet to taste their Icelandic offering after two visits.

Food is above average, having tasted the vieneseschnitzel in a night time visit, and their chicken schnitzel and waffles for brunch."}
{"text":"Go for the beer, not for the food. 

Food was good enough (not great) and we had a happy service experience, but I can see how some of the other reviewers' could have had poor service. Overall, a little chaotic, but again they have an extensive beer list, and the bartender gave good advice for our selections."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch so did not try any of their beers. From the menu, they have 100s of beers to select from and would be a fun place to go to in the summer when the patio is open.

I ordered:
-chicken & spatzle soup - pretty average and does not taste as good as in Germany
-pork schnitzel - a bit overfried. It was a big portion, I could not finish the entire thing.
-chocolate mousse cake - so yummy :) highly recommend!"}
{"text":"** Brunch Review **

I've been to bier market quite a few times and they (obviously) always have great beers (the fries are good too).  We had a large group and were seated with plenty of space on the fenced raised floor level inside).

The 2 star rating was for a dismal brunch offering. The  food is overpriced for the quality. As well our server was inattentive (or they have trouble staffing the outdoor patio and indoor seating at the same time).

The funniest thing was the guy next to me tried the belgian waffles (11$)..... they sounded like the could be teeth-shattering. I've had waffles in Belgium before - which were chewy and delicious!! At the end of the meal one of the wait staff came to ask how everything was (kinda too late?) and his response was 'These waffles need a steak knife', they actually brought out a steak knife! (picture proof!) LOL. 

If it were me I would have sent it back to the kitchen and just stuck with the beer for brunch :)"}
{"text":"Le Bier Markt a remplac√© l'ancien Queue de Cheval et est un concept qui nous vient de Toronto. Un peu chi-chi, √ßa reste une bonne place o√π d√©couvrir la plus grande s√©lections de bi√®res Belges en ville, ainsi qu'une vari√©t√© int√©ressante de bi√®res provenant de plus de 30 pays. Outre √ßa, je n'ai pas √©t√© super impressionn√©e. Ils n'√©taient juste pas pr√™ts. 

Ma visite co√Øncidait avec la deuxi√®me journ√©e d'ouverture du resto et il est arriv√© √† une dizaine de reprises que les bi√®res command√©es n'√©taient pas en stock. J'aurais compris apr√®s quelques semaines, mais d√®s la 2e journ√©e? De plus, j'ai trouv√© la s√©lection des bi√®res locales extr√™mement limit√©e. Ils ont quasiment que les grandes brasseries en stock et rendent difficile la t√¢che de d√©couvrir les plus petits brasseurs d'ici. N√©anmoins, c'est maintenant l'endroit o√π trouver la plus grande s√©lection de bi√®res en ville - toute qualit√© et provenance confondue. 
 
Honn√™tement, j'aurais typiquement donn√© 2 √©toiles, mais pourquoi la 3e? Le menu avec tous les accords mets-bi√®res d'indiqu√©s, le comptoir de fromage et de charcuteries, les gauffres, le menu de nuit et la s√©lection de lambics! (Vraiment. La gauffre s'mores est juste d√©bile.) 

Notez aussi qu'ils diffusent les matchs d'hockey et qu'ils servent le brunch les samedi et dimanches d√®s 11h. 

√âtant donn√© ma proximit√© au bar, je risque quand m√™me d'y retourner et probablement √† plusieurs reprises. Si √ßa s'am√©liore, je vous en donnerai des nouvelles. Promis.

{"text":"Great downtown place to enjoy end of day beer and amazing schnitzel. The veal or pork one, you won't be disappointed. 
Perfect for watching a game, group meeting. 
Once you go, you come back \"-)"}
{"text":"\"Frickin' AWESOME!\" Says the Yelp Dutchess of The Bier Markt (me!). 

We'll be in Montreal for 4 days and we've been here twice already. We stumbled on this place searching for a liquor store, but one peek inside and I knew we MUST return. 

The first visit was for a snack and some drinky-poos. We both ordered beer flights, local craft beer flight and sweet & sour. Hubby ordered the Big Twist XL pretzel. And dammit we gave it a good try but the two of us couldn't finish it. It was bigger that Bob's head! 

We stopped in again today for lunch, drinky-poos and some World Cup soccer. 

I liked the sweet & sour flight so much I ordered it again. One of the beers tasted exactly like sour cherry blasters candy. Amazing! Hubby really liked the 3 tea beer and enjoyed a few of those. 

The pork schnitzel was calling to my Austrian heritage and I felt my life wouldn't be complete without ordering that. I was right. The schnitzel was pounded thin, fried perfectly crispy, and covered almost the entire plate with a side of pan gravy for dipping. Perfection. It came with a side of Emmental cheese spaetzle (omg, I could eat a tub of this stuff) and braised purple cabbage, tangy and a touch sweet (exactly like my mom used to make). *wipes away a nostalgic tear

We also ordered a side of crispy house made onion rings and a bier bacon cheese dip with everything pretzels. Every dish was executed to exacting standards, no prepackaged junk to be found. I'm in love. 

If I could give 6 stars I would. If I could stand out front wearing a beer costume to get people to come in I would. 

I don't know how I'm going to go back home knowing we have no Bier Markt in Edmonton. 

I love you Bier Markt, I'll be back. Don't ever change."}
{"text":"It's expensive, but the food is decent and the selection of beer is probably unmatched or close to it. The one way to justify the trip here is to drink stuff you'd never normally get and not find at most LCBOs. Is this place life changing? Probably not. But they do have a nice place and it's worth the go."}
{"text":"Food and service was under whelming. We ordered 6 oysters, 2 which were questionable in appearance and not worth the risk of food poisoning.  We split a pizza which had no flavour and was very small, you would be better off with one from the frozen section of the supermarket. If you are looking for a long beer list, bland food, and sub par service this is for you"}
{"text":"After a couple of failed attempts in the location that once held the Amsterdam Brewing Company (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/amsterdam-brewing-company-limited-toronto#hrid:DYDkXYHhIMDO5vnuYloAhA/query:amsterdam%20brewing%20company), the Bier Markt has decided to attempt to duplicate the success of its Esplanade location in the upwardly-mobile location that is my neighbourhood.  Now admittedly, outside of special dinner nights at the Esplanade version of the restaurant, I've never really been a fan of the somewhat pricey menu (really, $10 for fries?) and the pricey-yet-overwhelming beer menu.  The selection is good, don't get me wrong, but I find it hard to spend an evening there and not feel out of pocket.  I thought I'd give the new place a go and see if I'd feel different.

I did feel different.  It's worse.  Maybe it's the newness of the location as I did see it in its first fortnight of being open, but the place seemed somewhat frantic.  There was initial confusion as to where I ask to get a table, be it on the patio or in the restaurant.  The maitre-d' area became congested quickly and there seemed to be no sense of order as to who would be sat when.  When I got to my table it seemed every staff member had a wide-eyed look of terror in them that made me wonder if everyone started that afternoon.  I stuck to their sweet spot of Trappist and Abbey-style beers and that seemed to suit fine.

The final shot for me was the food.  When you purport yourself to be definitively Belgian and place your mussels (or \"moules\" in the local vernacular), it'd be really handy if half of them were not slammed shut and inedible.  I appreciated the fact that I was offered replacement mussels, but by then it was by far too much of an okay thing.  I had better luck making my own."}
{"text":"The Bier Markt on the Esplanade is the first one in the city and became the downtown place to meet for an overwhelming range of beers.  Taking on a Belgian feel, the Bier Markt focuses on typical Belgian fare that will complement the beers they have on offer.  Beside the meal entries in the menu, beer suggestions are also provided.

The restaurant itself is deep with a bar situated in the centre of the space as you walk in.  There are more secluded dining areas available if need be, and large beer-hall style long wooden tables for you and a large party to be sat at.  The front area consists of smaller four-seater tables that look out onto the patio which you'll consider yourself very fortunate to get a seat on in the summer.

It's a fine restaurant, don't get me wrong.  I was particularly impressed with the special event meal that was put on some time ago with a fixed menu of five courses, each with a supporting beer.  It was a truly fantastic and savoury night.  But outside of the special events, I always seem to feel somewhat overwhelmed by the beer options and find it a bit overpriced for my liking.  But that's just me.  I just like beer."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best bar in mississauga.  I've been there a couple times and always got really good service.   The staff was polite and professional and made great selections most of the time in terms of which beer goes with what.   

The patio is awesome and the food is decent (not the chicken wings, they're sauce is probably Frank's red hot)

Seems like a great place to go after work, or for a good night on the weekends.   Especially if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Get the duck wings. They are so decadent. Our waitress was amazing as well. I believe her name was Jianna (spelling?). She was extremely knowledgable regarding both the 'beer bible' and the menu. I was very pleasantly surprised with this spot."}
{"text":"definitely geared towards an older more mature crowd that can appreciate what they have to offer. To me, it was overpriced and boring. Pretty decor though!"}
{"text":"3 stars just for the lager flight and fries - really good. 

but DO NOT get the Ahi Tuna Burger!! It's overcooked so the texture is like a cross between canned tuna and ground chicken. Overseasoned with black pepper and wasabi aioli - doesn't go well together at all. 

Service was lacking - had to seat ourselves, waited forever for someone to take order and get the bill, and there were multiple people serving us."}
{"text":"Love BierMarkt.. so close to home is gonna be dangerous though :-S
Try the capon wings - spicy though.
I like the idea of the Bier sampler but I'm not sure it's a great deal.. I have tried a couple of them and I guess they're alright.
Overpriced place for what it is though..

p.s. Steigl Raddler (grapefruit) FTW!"}
{"text":"Hang out with friends. Ordered couple of drinks and meal, servers are not quick AT ALL. Made mistakes and forgot our orders TWICE. Not that friendly. Just not good service tonight"}
{"text":"Our favourite restaurant! Newer, Bigger and better!!! We often come here for  beers and Delish foodies!! Oh sooooo yummy! The place is new, spacious, a bit loud compared to the Bier market at Sherway gardens. This will be our new cool spot from now on"}
{"text":"Went back and the food was great I would say try the mussels for sure! Also our waitress Savannah was amazing!"}
{"text":"Went here with a couple colleagues for a drink during the week.   The service was horrible.  First they were understaffed, which sometimes happens and I can't fault the workers. BUT our server/bartender (he had an area to look after as well...) would be talking to us and taking orders and all of a sudden just leave mid sentence to go say Hi to people he would know walking in....very rude and unprofessional. Happened 3 times.  THIS i can fault with the workers.

Also screwed up our food orders too, had the manager looking confused as he kept bringing wrong items.
Food prices was over priced for what you got.  The wings were good but small.  The oysters way over priced for what you got.  The cheese dip was good though but we had to ask for more bread as it came with 5...

THE GOOD STUFF

Beer selection: 5 star completely.  Draft was cold, lots of unique bottles to choose from for all tastes.
Not jammed packed, very casual dress, not douchy .Music was at a good level

ITs a ok place to go on King West for a drink during the week.  Service sucks from the  3 times i visited...and don't waste your time on the food BUT
its not to busy, you can have a conversation, and they have lots of beers."}
{"text":"I have never giving any place a one star review but this place actually made me! Congrats Beir Market.  I have been to a few of these places and it was ok...nothing great, except for sq one which is fun at night.

Driving back from the airport we were hungry and decided to stop in to the sherway garden location.

First our waiter said he was new...so we could excuse a few things from him.  But there was two specials, and he couldn't figure it out, and disappeared for while before coming back.  And even then he got it wrong....

He poured water, missed the glass which got all over the table.  but he didn't even come back to wipe it down, so water was all over the table, getting to the phone.

We ordered two ciders.  Eventually he came back and said there was only enough for one pint.  When he brought it over, it wasn't even filled up to the line, and it was ALL ice.  The bartender should have just informed him to tell us it was not even enough for one.  Instead of giving me a not filled glass of mostly ice.

Ordered a steak medium rare.  It came out over cooked.  But i realize this isn't a steak house so i proceeded to eat it.  Onion rings were not that great either.
What made this gross was finding 2 hairs under the steak as i was cutting it.  By time the waiter came by,  the person i was with was pretty much done.  So no point of getting another one.  Waiter came by eventually goes ew gross, and wipes away the hairs with his hands (pretty gross btw)

So to sum up the failure of why 1 star:
New waiter: couldn't get the daily specials right, spilled water didn't clean up, was slow, 
Who ever poured the drinks: dishonest, tried to make a pint by using all ice ( i know how cider is poured) and didn't even get to the line
Cooks : Over cooked steaks, with not one hair but two
Management: should have come out to apologize after steak sent back.  

Sure they took my half eating steak off the bill, but still.
We honestly wanted to leave a zero percent tip, but left 10% still."}
{"text":"I've always liked bier markt u get a HUGE variety of beer to choose from, if ur not a beer drinker u can opt for wine, cocktails, or other drinks.  Perfect place at just chill and lay back with friends, family, or that special someone.  They have lots of appetizers for u to choose from.  They have a pretty good menu with lots of choices from steak to salads from burgers to mussels.  They have daily specials as well.  They have patio, indoor dining room, and bar area.  On certain nights they also have live music.  This is a casual restaurant so wear whatever u feel like.  The appetizers on more on the average side but huge variety makes up for the average taste."}
{"text":"This is a great place to drink premium beers and eat good food. The atmosphere is rockin' on the weekend, but a little quiet and dark during the week. 

The beer selection's choice, although they did not have La Chouffe?!! Boo-urns. And I am saying boo-urns and not 'Burns.'

Food is tasty and prompt, and service is pretty good. I have been here before when it is standing room only, and still, it delivers."}
{"text":"I'm not a beer drinker. Beer is the only thing one should come here for. We had dinner of poutine, sausages and schnitzel. This and two drinks really should not cost nearly $100, for what we got. I suppose the beer selection must be impressive, all else is secondary and it shows. Schnitzel may as well be a synonym for \"gross chicken fried steak with a pricetag of actual steak.\" We could not finish our meal, it was that bad."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday and ordered the special. Beef brisket sandwich with a side of fries for $16. It was good but was too small for the price I paid.

A buddy ordered a diet soda and he said that it was not refillable. And at $2.50 a glass, they even have the nerve to fill it up with 3/4 of ice. Seriously?!?!?!?

Will not be back"}
{"text":"Bah, yes I know this place has lots of beer but so do lots of other places in Toronto.

This place ain't my cup of tea for the following reasons
1) It's always jam packed on popular nights - not in a fun way
2) It lacks any sort of fun theme/atmosphere
3) Conversations are pointless because it's way too loud
4) This is the kind of place where I always leave with a beer soaked shirt. Not because I got crazy, but because it's just a pushy and semi brutal crowd."}
{"text":"I could not tell you anything about the food we waited over 30 mins for someone to come to our table then decided to walk out and eat across the street. Can I add we had a reservation !!!! And they just ignored us."}
{"text":"Get. the. Poutine. flight. It is absolutely delicious! I'm not a big beer drinker so I did not try any of the ales but the poutine and salads are pretty good!! Also if you come on a Friday night, there will be a live band playing."}
{"text":"Big selection of beer, and I appreciate the inclusion of Kriek (Belgian cherry beer on the menu), but this place is simply too loud and busy. I will come here if it's suggested by friends, but would not on my own accord. There are better atmospheres in the city for a similar selection of beer (see: BeerBistro or The Town Crier)."}
{"text":"This place was decent. Went here with the boyf while visiting Toronto. Huge selection of craft beers which was awesome. Excellent place to go for drinks and a quick snack as the outdoor seating was very nice. The meal, however, was slightly overpriced and not worth it. I got a burger that was huge but simply lacked the taste of a good burger. Another thing to look out for is seating. I was seated outside right by the flowers. At first I had no problem with this. As our meal went on, the flowers attracted a bee which was very distracting and just a burden on us. The staff was very friendly. We would definitely go again but strictly for drinks and a quick bite."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are great (that's why it's 2 stars instead of 1), no complaints there, but there service is terrible. We were a party of 6 and didn't make a reservation. Patiently waited for a table while getting drinks at the bar. The bartender was friendly and attentive (blonde guy,  don't know his name). The bad service started when we got to our table. One waitress came to introduce herself and said she'll be serving us (we never said her again). After about 20 minutes another waitress came. She took one order and disappeared for the next 30 minutes so none of the other 5 people at the table ordered any food. Once she came back she brought the first order of food and proceeded to take everyone else's order. I don't know about you guys, but when I'm with a group of friends I expect everyone to get their food at the same time...  Anyways another 15 minutes later my beer came. Finally. And another 20 minutes after that, everyone else's food came. Great now we all started eating together... I felt rude starting my meal so now I was eating cold steak (cooked to perfection... It was still great cold). I recommend the beet and quinoa salad with a side NY steak for people who want to eat and still feel like they can go dance later without having to unbutton their pants. Everyone was hungry so the food was gone pretty quickly, nobody came to get out dirty dishes or glasses which gave me urges to get up and bring it all to the kitchen myself. The waitress was nowhere to be seen. There was no water at the table and everyone was feeling pretty pasty after the beer and food. Finally, I spotted a hostess and asked her for the bill to while she replied she will find our waitress (sadly,  she never came...). After 20 minutes and no alternatives we all got up and went to look for the waitress ourselves. She finally appeared after my boyfriend spoke to the front staff and told them we were going to leave the restaurant in the next 5 minutes without paying if they didn't give us our bill. So all on all, the food was awesome but I have seen better service at McDonald's."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Came here after dropping off our bags in our hotel nearby. Everything was delicious and our bar tender/waitress was so nice. It was a great introduction to Montreal. We ordered some beers, I got a local IPA and it was really good. We also ordered a cheese dip which was good and had maybe some roasted reds on top of it. Also we ordered the amazing duck wings, which are served with a mustard based sauce and a lingonberry BBQ sauce. Those were some of the best wings I've ever had! Overall, definitely the type of place that breeds loyalty. We wi be back before we leave the city. Excellent, huge beer selection, excellent food."}
{"text":"spent the early evening there on a Friday after work...the patio wasn't too crowded and as always the beer was great, they have the same menu from the other location. will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I went here a couple weeks back with a couple of friends on a thursday and it was  busy! There was a good 30-40 min wait to get a seat on the patio, probably because the weather was beautiful. There was a great selection of beer from all over the world and I tried a couple different ones. The servers and staff was friendly and the service was fast. 
The downfall for this place was the food, it was expensive and not worth the price. 
Other than that, it's a good spot to enjoy beer with friends. 
I definitely think they should expand their patio as well, beer is best enjoyed outdoors in my opinion."}
{"text":"The definition of mediocrity lies here folks. Occupying a nice stretch of the Esplanade is a restaurant that hires rude, incapable, but pretty waitresses. Service was extremely slow. The staff didn't even get handkerchiefs for everyone, so we had to ask.

We were seated at a particularly cold and dark corner of the restaurant and had to ask three different staff to get re-seated somewhere a little less drafty. It was an epic struggle.

Everyone ordered steaks, medium rare. Our steaks were clearly not a very good cut - rather stringy. The fries were crispy. Asparagus was super tasty. Actually, all of the cooking besides the steaks were good - and even the steaks were well prepared - the steak itself was just cheap.

So what can I say? The chefs do a decent job. The management is screwing this place up. It was once a joint I used to visit a few times every season - but I don't think I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"At the Bier Markt at Esplanade and it's always a good time with food and wide selections of beer. It's a little dark in here but I guess this is the ambiance they were going for. We got the Muskoka Detour ISA (Craft), the Palm Speciale Belge Ale (Pale/Amber) and the Ceres Strong Ale (Blond). As for the food, we got the Dunkel Duck Wings and Beef & Cheddar Poutine. I found the food pretty good but the beer is really what I came for. 

The service was decent, some servers were good some looked like they were on the job for the first day. With the large selection of beer, the beer menu wasn't organized very well in my opinion. I guess when you are drinking then it doesn't really matter. Overall, I would come back because it's a nice place and I like the layout of the bar. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"Huge place, great selection of beer, ok food and service. For the price I was expecting better quality and or more food. My salmon was meh and was hoping better, nor was it quite filling."}
{"text":"Some context for my harsh feelings towards 'Bier Markt':
Okay - I am really into beer and being new to the city, I prodded around for bars in Toronto that would be to my liking.  Bier Markt came up often.  Hell - it came pretty highly recommended on BeerAdvocate and RateBeer.  So expectation were high...

... but it's just a yuppie beer (yes - \"BEER\" not 'bier') bar.  With that said, the patio is sufficiently nice and the service was quite courteous.  If you like drinking overpriced bottled Belgian beer, this place is alright.  But is not a craft beer joint for the following reasons:

TAP SELECTION:  Maybe I came at the wrong time the draught selection was sorely lacking.  The taps selection was comparable to any run-of-the-mill dive bar.  Maybe it's just me - but I am only interested in draught selection.  I can easily source and buy rare bottles and enjoy it at home.  If you're used to joints with a 25+ craft brew rotation, Bier Markt is not for you.  Let me put it this way - I had two pints and asked for the bill.  I had already had everything else they had on tap -- and I didn't like any of it.  We walked down the street to Bar Hop for our beer fix.

IMPORT-MANIA:  As soon as I saw that they listed the beer by country (they also boast about having beer from 24 countries), I should have just left.  I hate any place that does this.  When I lived in Japan, I routinely saw nice bars that featured bottles of Budweiser and Coors on display.  Yup - Bud and Coors.  Why?  Because morons think \"beer from further away\" = \"better beer\".   Now apply this reasoning to Stella Artois, Czechvar, Heineken, Beck's, etc... do people honestly not realize they are drinking swill just because it's imported?  There are some fine Belgian brews available - but lot of European trash beers too.

I know they don't have these in the GTA, but if you've been to a Fogg N' Suds (they are all over the place in Vancouver) -- Bier Markt is basically a Fogg N' Suds with 'yuppie guido' set to maximum... actually, the Fogg N' Suds chain has a better brew selection.  That's pretty sad."}
{"text":"A good pub option located in the more expensive and busy part of town. We came on a Friday night after our original dinner location had a line waiting out the door. I was happy to find open tables available! 

Extensive beer lists and well-built flight options make it easy to find something to drink. The food is your typical pub staples of fries, wings, burgers and salads. I had the Beet and Quinoa Salad which was passable. It came looking like a mess of spinach leaves and slice radish, but the beet and quinoa was buried in the pile somewhere (see picture). Presentation aside, it was missing the sweet and crunchy salad components that would have made it more interesting. 

If you are ordering the sharing boards, be sure to double check the bottom of the grilled bistro bread. Our table had a completely charred black piece, but the staff were accommodating and happy to get us some new bread when we pointed it out."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night looking for a quiet place to have a drink. The general atmosphere is one of a upscale pub, complete with dark lighting and a cosy atmosphere. They happened to have a live band doing covers that night, so it added to the general ambiance of the place. 

They were quick to bring us our drinks (great selection!), but unfortunately the wait for our food was really long. Our waitress thankfully noticed and checked for us without our prompting, returning to explain that there was a mix up and clarified what happened to our order. We were not in a rush and she was nice about it, so it wasn't a big deal. However, if we were under a time constraint, it would definitely be annoying. We shared the fondue, which is various varieties of carbs with a melted pot of cheese. It was a great accompaniment to the beer and conversation!"}
{"text":"The food is perfect for beer drinking! The menu selections and explanations for the different beers is excellent. I visited with a group of patrons with variable tastes in beer and everyone found an option they liked. The calamari were tasty but I didn't really find anything exceptional about them...would definitely return for a day drinking afternoon. The prices are definitely on point as well. The 4 stars were earned because of the expertly crafted beer menu and selection---the food is really a very tasty afterthought!"}
{"text":"A lovely patio for later-evening Sunday night dining.  Based on other reviews, I'm glad I wasn't here on a Friday or Saturday or this review would most likely be 2 stars.

The service was iffy.  The classic poutine was just how I like it--cheesy, salty, fatty deliciousness.  When ordered as an app, together with a gallette (potatos layered with cheese and bacon)...be prepared to pick at your entree.  I ordered the Steak Frites, rare, and my steak came out more medium-rare (or even medium).  Howevs, it had that juicy salty crust that I love so much...I didn't complain (but probably should have)."}
{"text":"Je dirais que c'√©tait correct. Le service √©tait bon, surtout que nous √©tions un gros groupe et le d√©cor chaleureux, mais la nourriture n'√©tait juste pas g√©niale. J'ai choisi le tartare de boeuf, que j'ai malheureusement trouv√© sans go√ªt. Les huitres √† 1$, bien que c'est le fun, et la mignonette √©tait bonne, n'√©taient pas bien pr√©sent√©s, donc d√©chir√©es et la plupart sans leur premi√®re eau. 

Je n'h√©siterais quand m√™me pas √† revenir, en gang, car le choix de bi√®res est tr√®s bien et les prix raisonnables!"}
{"text":"Okay, the crowd here brings out the violent side in me but I have to say I had a much better time here than I thought I would and mainly that's due to the effects of a good hefeweizen and an absolutely amazing house band!  Like what the?! It was the last thing I expected from this place.  I love that they sort of banged out all these great top 40 covers with all the enthusiasm of a band playin' the Rogers Centre and then they were actually really great as well.  It sort of made sense of the obnoxious crowd and the predictable menu and of course all that beer is helpful."}
{"text":"I went with some of my friends for for a friend's farewell. It actually reminded me of my university's pub (but just a bit bigger and a tad classier). I had a blast that night. I would definitely recommend the Fruli for all girly drinkers everywhere that have avoided beer. The live band that we had that night (Big Catch) was really great too. I would totally come here again if i need a night just to chill, chat with friends, and dance to some great music."}
{"text":"Bier Markt has now become my goto spot for team lunches and business lunches. The new menu that was introduced on May 21st brings some great new dishes. 

Specials of the day tend to sell out quickly, so if your a little late for lunch - you may miss out."}
{"text":"SHOULD BE 1 STAR BUT THEY SENT ME A COUPON SO I FEEL BAD. 

Had a terrible experience at the restaurant and the food wasn't good either. ( Dec 27th-ish)

Ordered fondue which came with stale bread. Worst part of it was it was all lumpy and separating. Not did it only look like vomit, it tasted like it too. Also ordered a burger, the buns were toasted or anything and the sauces or meat made it all wet. The patty was bland and crumbly so it literally broke apart into pieces. Fries were stale. 

Overall terrible food that i payed over $50 for. 

Reviewed their services on the link at the bottom of the bill and didn't realize they would read it immediately. They apologized and said they would send me something in the mail. They said it should be there 3-5 days, fast forward 2weeks nothing came. I called them up asking if they actually sent me something. 4 weeks later received a $25 coupon. 

Guess i'll try it again or give it to someone homeless."}
{"text":"This place is great for a relax night out!

The beer selection is amazing,

The food was very good. I had shared the wurst sampler ( for 2) which had a variety of sausages, fresh pretzels, cheese and dijon. Followed by the schnitzel, which was mediocre.

Can't wait to go back and try the moules!"}
{"text":"As we approached, a mob of Toronto Blue Jay fans marched toward us under a single voice of, \"Blueeee Jays\" repeatedly.  Gulp.  Any apprehension we had was warranted because as San Diego Padre fans and in \"enemy\" territory we had every reason to think twice.  Fortunately, we weren't wearing anything friar-like.  No blue. No brown. No yellow.  This ain't the 80s.  Then just like that, they all rolled as a unified blue mob into Bier Markt.  

We followed in with them and instantly felt welcomed.  For those that are familiar, the closest comparison would be Yard House in the States with the many, many taps of beer.  Similarly, Bier Markt does better because it focuses on being a beerpub (A Taste OF EUROPE!) than trying to be a restaurant with beer as an after thought.  But of course, they do serve food also.  We unfortunately didn't try the food as were intent on and not disappointed in pickling our livers with the fast and friendly bartend service.

Interestingly, the entire staff all wear the French classic black Lacoste polo shirts.  The crocodile logo is unmistakeable.  Dig it."}
{"text":"Ordered beer. 
They were out.
Ordered an app.
They were out.

Poutine was terrible. Potato cheese soup.. Is a closer name. 

There were more onions than noodles in my wife's pasta. 

And the hostess made a point of telling us what time we had to leave by. 

$100 for dinner, solidly disappointed. 

(Also fun story... There was a guy in the bathroom asking for toilet paper.... Because no one restocked it for 7pm on a Friday)"}
{"text":"This is one a few Bier Markt's in the Toronto core.  I probably would have opted for 2.5 if available as a score -- but will go high rather than low.

Good location.  Very accessible by transit.  Street parking or private Lot parking (paid) is your only choice if driving.

Located in a basement of a building at King and Portland.  They do have a patio on the Portland side.

Four of us went, and things we enjoyed were:
- the Markt Burger (thumbs up)
- Mussels and Frites (mussels were a bit small and the frites not up to the usual)
- Duck wings appetizer (awesome -- fabulous flavour and loved the dry rub!)
- schnitzel (chicken or pork -- we had pork - and you could have a variety of sauces/gravies --- was great

Pretty nice meal --- not inexpensive with drinks.
Would definitely go back but pass on the mussels.

Server was nice, but she did mess up a couple of things on the order which she corrected.  Soup came without a spoon and we waited for more than 5 minutes to see someone we could ask.  Guess it was during a non-busy period. 

Anyway -- been at the one at Don Mills and enjoyed.  Will probably stick with that location in future -- but you just never know."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch here the other day. 

I have to say I did not expect the ribs to be quite so good. However they were absolutely awesome. I ordered the ribs as a half rack, and they came with the Navajo spice dry rub on them. They also had some kind of really nice sauce with a brush on the plate to put on as you wanted. It also came with fries and slaw. These were some of the best ribs I had had in recent times.  

For dessert,  I split the chocolate waffles with ice cream with my companion. But one disappointment I had was that it seemed to be devoid of the chocolate sauce promised on the menu. When mentioned to our server, he said he would ask the kitchen, but then came back without any, which was really strange. It was really sad because it did kind of but not great ending on to what otherwise had been a great meal.

I enjoyed the ribs with a nice Somersby cider. 

Parking is available in a lot at the corner of the Don Mills centre on the NW corner."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service and the atmosphere is vibrant. Impressive beer selection although they have cider and wine as well. The poutine was excellent, as was the schnitzel. The duck wings are an interesting alternative to chicken wings. Finally, both the creme br√ªl√©e and the waffle ice cream sandwich are outstanding. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went in for lunch.

The place was empty, but I expected that from the weekday lunch hour.

The place was staffed for business and we certainly got the attention and best service in town.
The food and the drinks were great.

I will definitely come back with more appetite to try the burgers. The calamari and beef dip were outstanding."}
{"text":"I have some pretty great university memories of the Esplanade location, so it would take a lot to top my impressions of the location downtown - while this location doesn't completely top that, it's still a good choice for a group gathering in the west end. 

Drinks selection and variety was impressive, service was absolutely wonderful (thanks to our server Relina who put up with our crazy group so kindly and professionally!), and while the band the night we visited was a little cheesy, the ambiance was super relaxed, casual, and so much fun. There are large TVs to catch a game, drinks are delicious, and there's lots of parking. 

My one qualm would be that the food the night we visited was only so-so (it was a Saturday night). However, the drinks were awesome - if you like ciders that are lighter and a touch sweeter, definitely check out the Somersby Cider. Delicious, cool, light and refreshing! A great choice recommended by our server.

You can't really go wrong with picking this spot for a group outing or date. It's very casual (no real need to dress up, unless you want to), and it's a good choice for a relaxing evening out in the west end."}
{"text":"Based on friends and other Yelpers, I avoided the food at Bier Markt and went for the drinks.  

It was 9:00PM on a Tuesday night and the patio was packed.  This was a great atmosphere to lounge and have some drinks with friends.  We didn't make any reservations and only had to wait about 10 minutes.

I can't recall exactly how many pages the beer menu was, but I do remember almost panicking since I won't be able to try them all.  Beer Markt had quite an impressive list and although they did not have my favorite Belgium beer Satan Red, I did get a chance to try many others that I've never heard of.  My new favorite type of light fruity beer is Fruli.  It's a strawberry beer with only 4.5% alcohol and tasted like juice.  It was a great beer to end the night with since it felt almost like dessert."}
{"text":"Went here for a CrackBerry meetup. It was my first time here but I often did walk by the place but never went in.

The CrackBerry event included an alcohol/beer so I had one of their beers. I'm not a real beer drinker which is why I've never gone to this place. I will have the occasional beer if I'm with friends and they order a beer or if I go to a pub or if I'm offered a drink while playing in the casino. The event also included some small appetizers (finger food).

Since I had just finished work before showing up to the event, I decided to order something to eat. I decided to go with the poutine. I found the portion size of the poutine to be small for the price (it was roughly the size of a McDonald's poutine) and with my bacon add-on was $10+taxes+tip. Between the 2 beers that I had and the poutine (along with the free small finger food appetizers), I felt satisfied (although not stuffed).

I found it to be very loud in the place and could hardly hear myself talk or hear my colleague talk. I didn't have any problems with the service and the staff serving the beer as well as the server who took my poutine order and the person who brought me my order were all friendly. They have free WiFi here but required signing in with an e-mail address so I just opted to use the data on my cellphone.

I wouldn't have an issue coming back here especially to try the oysters deal advertised."}
{"text":"My group of friends went to Montreal for 5 nights and spent 3 of those nights at Bier Markt - that's how awesome this place is!

We were there the same week as the Junior Hockey Championships, so Bier Markt was pretty busy since it's right near the Bell Centre.  Luckily, we were able to get seats each time and hang out while the games were on.  

The details:
The drinks:  150 different beers from 30 different countries - what's not to love about that?  My advice is to stay away from the beer cocktails as they're just not worth it.

The food:  The food is a touch pricey, but that's to be expected in a city.  The standouts for me were the poutine (small portion, but well worth it - get the short rib one), the charcuterie (watch it being sliced downstairs!), and the bouillabaisse (HUGE portion).  We honestly didn't have a bad thing here. 

The service: The bartenders are amazing, knowledgeable and will lead you down the right path to find the perfect beer for you.  The service at the tables was a little slow, but they were busy, so there's that.

The music:  Two nights in a row they had a DJ who was actually mixing live, which you don't see much anymore.  He had a really good mix of music for all to enjoy.  There was one night with a live band that was absolutely awful. The musical selection was bad (so many Beach Boys songs) and their stage presence just wasn't my thing.  

The conclusion:  Bier Markt - Go.  Drink lots. Eat charcuterie.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Meh.
Good place to go if you want to sample different beers, but even then they don't seem to stock half of the brands on their menu.
Food was.. decent, but tiny portions."}
{"text":"First night in Montreal. It was near the hotel. Very loud sports bar with expected frequently yelled expletives. We shared a full rack of very very dry ribs and a tour of their poutines. The poutines were all tasty but would have been improved had the frites started slightly more crisp before adding the rest of the ingredients. Nice beer selection of 150 from around the world. The staff was friendly but not particularly attentive. As it is close by, we will likely give it another try."}
{"text":"Price: 
$7.74 Leffe Brun 
$17 Small sausage board with extra cheese
$24 Cheese and Lager fondue

I usually have a great time here at Bier Markt, but the experience last night was just so surprisingly poor.

My boyfriend and I arrived excited and happy to eat here, only to be greeted by a hostess who seemed so frazzled and distracted. She asked how many people we needed a table for and we told her a table for 2. A company of 3 arrives after us, and they were taken to a table right away. She returns to us and asks us again how many people we needed a table for, forgetting that she had already asked us just minutes earlier. She apologized saying that they were short a hostess.

Our waitress was really pleasant and sweet, but seemed overworked.

We ordered a small sausage board and the cheese and lager fondue. On other visits when we previously bought the fondue, it was thick and creamy and perfectly cheesy. But when we received it this time around, it was so watered down and had the look and consistency of milk. We called our waitress over and explained this and she took it back to the kitchen. When she returned with the new fondue, it was thicker and much like what we remember it as being. She mentioned that even the kitchen thought it was too watery and apologized. 

The small sausage board was tasty! However, the bottom of the pretzel was pretty burnt. But we just ate it anyway.

Overall, disappointing experience but maybe last night was just busy. I still enjoy coming to Bier Markt and try not to let it affect future experiences."}
{"text":"We arrived at Bier Markt on October 9th, 2015 at 7 pm. Ordered calamari, duck wings and 2 orders of 2 different flavor mussels. Everything came fast. Calamari and duck wings were good. Mussels were undercooked. We asked to send it back to kitchen to get them cooked some more. The kitchen replaced our two orders of mussels with new ones and cooked them well this time. Our waiter was quick and courteous. 
The beer was very good . Overall we enjoyed."}
{"text":"We took advantage of $1 oysters on Thursdays. 2 of 12 had slight issues with shell but very minor. Flavor of the oysters themselves were lacking but good mignonettes and well served on the right kind/size of shaved ice. Enjoyed a couple bites of my friend's delicious calamari, perfectly cooked, and took a beef tartar myself which was very much lacking in flavor, but easily rectified with some salt, pepper and other sauces/lemon available from other dishes on the table. Our server was sweet and helped lift the overall experience. In all, many overpriced dishes and drinks, but not as bad as I was expecting. Would go back for oysters and a 5a7 but not at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time go across the street to Joeys. The Sherway Gardens area was devoid of decent bars for years - maybe that's what kept this location going. As a bar it's not bad looking with a couple big screens and nice decor. As a restaurant it's overpriced and boring. Our table ordered shnitzels, a burger and a poutine with candied bacon. Fries were over cooked, hard and cold. The candied bacon was NOT candied. I must admit it was nice smokey bacon. The $25 shnitzel was a totally unseasoned panko-crusted cutlet. Gravy on the side was excellent. The house-made emmental cheese sp√§tzle tasted like it had absolutely no emmental. Strangely two out of four people in our party (that have absolutely no allergies) had mild allergic reactions immediately after eating - very strange and kind of scary. Staff were all excellent. Service was fast and friendly. Bottom line... Overpriced crap food that misrepresents the ingredients in their dishes. Go across the street to Joey's!"}
{"text":"My first time eating (drinking) here.  Fondue was great with the chorizo grilled cheese, friendly service and the beer is fantastic (of course)..

I totally recommend this place is great for lunch, afternoon business meetings and dinner. Ask for the unibroue black current beer, killer"}
{"text":"The food was good. I had the candy bacon and chicken wings. The location and atmosphere was really relaxed and can easily be a get together place.

We sat outside. The service experience was s.l.o.w. Getting a second beer was too long of a wait; I just cancelled mine. The food was also took a long time to come out. And the place was not busy. This was about 1pm. Getting the check required 3 separate request."}
{"text":"was super stoked to see one of these pop up so close to me! 

the decor is very bold and modern, and staff is friendly and very knowledgable on the vast selection of beer available. i also like how beer pairings are included on the menu for easier decision making. so far, the suggestions have been spot on. know what you're eating before ordering your brew! 

with such an emphasis on the pints i didnt expect the food to be as tasty as as it was! really, really good grub- huge portions and well plated. my favourite is the pot of muscles. 6 different varieties to choose from (lobster creme and Pernod, Congo, thai inspired....plus the classics), with a hefty bun for dipping so you get the most out of the delicious broth. great casual dining. 

meals are a little pricey though. I won't be here as often as I'd like to be but definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best - there is nothing special about the restaurant.  I got conflicting info from different waiter or waitresses."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how disappointed I was with my mussels and frites. The sauce had zero flavor, when I asked for parsley they gave me a tiny cup with a few pinches worth. Didn't realize parsely was so hard to come by. Fat chunks of bacon and mushroom did absolutely nothing for the flavor. It was bland as f***

Like seriously guys, just throw in some garlic and butter and parsley, and a squeeze of lemon and you're good to go. When was the last time you even tasted your food? 

My boyfriend had a burger and didn't finish it (said it tasted funny). And normally inhales food like a john deer mowing machine.

The only positive was the extensive beer selection and cozy patio chairs. 

But the food is way overpriced given how thoroughly unenjoyable it was."}
{"text":"Service is average. Not a large selection of food and over priced for the size of the food.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna and was surprised to see 2 little pieces on the plate when it came.  My friend had fried chicken and it tasted like fish ( the oil was probably used to fry fish earlier).  At least the atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"Stopped by here this Saturday evening for a bite & some drinks with the BF. Large gorgeous patio that just opened up for the season, but we opted to sit inside since it was getting a bit chilly.

Bier Markt has over 150 different beers, and each menu item comes with a recommended beer pairing - really cool if you're looking to try some out. Beers for everyone (including non-alcoholic), even some sweet fruity ones for those who aren't big on beer. Small cocktail list too - the peach bellini is refreshing, delicious, and lighter than most bellinis I have had.

Food-wise, we had the following:

Markt Charcuterie ($22) - assorted meats, pickled veggies, mustards, grilled bistro bread, and an odd mango compote (tasted sort of like mango with peppers?). Okay charcuterie board - my fav was the pickled veggies.

Brasserie Burger Bites ($15) - prime rib, smoked bacon, gruyere cheese, granny smith apple compote, remoulade on mini grilled buns. My favourite of the night! At first I think apple compote on the burgers might be weird, but the combo of all the flavours worked really well. I wish the meat was less well done, but it was still yummy overall

Smoked Meat Poutine ($15) - okay poutine, nothing special.

Veal Schnitzel ($25) - I didn't actually eat this, but my boyfriend said it was extremely overcooked, almost to the point of being inedible. 

Overall the food was decent, however, the service was absolutely ATROCIOUS. There was a point where we did not see our server for over an HOUR. No one else stopped in to check on us either. We spoke with the manager after getting a different servers attention, who apologized and took $40 from the bill.

It's a shame service was so bad because there are a few things on the menu I'd like to try out (especially the desserts and more beers!) MIGHT come back to check out brunch, but likely to a different location.

Avoid this place at peak hours, I'd say!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very sports oriented restaurant. They have a giant statue of a kid wearing a hockey jersey that you have to see for yourself. Great food and very fast service not to mention i had a perfectly cooked steak and it isn't even a steakhouse. There are two floors and the first floor has a very large open bar area for late-night drinks. Casual, touristy, trendy, and fun !"}
{"text":"Went to the Bier Markt before the Leafs game. Found the food good as ever, and the same great beer selection. Range of beers on tap still not what it used to be, but happy to sit on what is a decent TO patio and eat good food.

Waiter didn't have the beer knowledge that I'm accustomed to there, but maybe he was trying to dumb it down for me."}
{"text":"This is quite the cute little spot. I came here for drinks and was greeted warmly by a hostess. She asked me if I've ever been there and what I liked to drink.

I was seated in a booth promptly and asked if I would like anything to drink. I ordered a Sex on the Beach. I have to say it's the tastiest Sex on the beach I've ever had. 

I will say that you should order a double shot of vodka as it hardly tasted like it had any alcohol in it at all.

The music was blaring and had a lounge type feel to it. The energy in this place was nice. 

Service was very good as well, our waitress checked up on us repeatedly and was very attentive.  

The live band is awesome,.. They were singing some nice songs, for example \"Ascension\" by Maxwell and I equally enjoyed their version.

I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Came here a month ago with some friends while I was visiting Toronto. There was live music which would've been pretty good if it wasn't for the fact that my table was right beside the speaker so basically we couldn't talk at all the entire time the music was going. I thought the food was decent, not spectacular but overpriced. They have a very thorough beer menu and the one I tried was very tasty. Can't remember the name but it tasted like grapefruit.

Also, will never forget this place because I got bird pooped on the first time in my life during this meal."}
{"text":"We were 8 people dropping in for a drink/snacks on a busy Saturday evening without a reservation and they were able to accommodate us pretty promptly (only a 30 min wait!).  We were seated at a long harvest table by the entrance which made conversations a little challenging to say the least.  Adding insult to injury, it was so loud in there, you couldn't here the person sitting right in front of you even when they were shouting at the top of their lungs.  This location was so cramped and understaffed, it took us forever to get our drinks.  

All I recall from this night is that we ended up leaving after our second round of drinks to seek peace and quiet in a nearby Goose and Firkin.  

I would totally recommend this place if you're on a date with someone really dull and you need to spend at least half an hour with them just to be polite."}
{"text":"Had quite the negative experience.  I flew from my home in NYC to Pearson to meet up with my family in Mississauga. I just moved to New York for work.

  I couldn't wait to see them for an event we planned for weeks.  When I arrived I showed my new NY enhanced drivers ID and was denied entry.  The bouncer was crude and unprofessional, denying me entry and asking me for an addiontial picture ID. I asked for proof that my Government issued ID was not valid for which he did not present.    I didn't have an addiontal picture ID and feverishly presented him with all my debit and credit cards as proof.  Being 30 this seemed surreal.  I showed him a picture of my passport after wasting about 45 minutes, calling my party who was already inside.  Upon further research and contacting the Alcohol and Gaming Commision of Ontaio I verified he was incorrect.  

Service was subpar, professionalism was beyond deficient and they did a hell of a job belittling me.   If you want to be treated like scum come here. I will never come back again.  Cheers."}
{"text":"ambiance and beers are great!! i went twice and i was disappointed by the food. service is great. there is music at night and lots of screens to watch sports."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner dinner here. Good atmosphere and each of our 3 meals was well prepared, tasted great and were served hot. The service was professional but I confess it was a bit slow to take our orders and get the check."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been to the location on the esplanade as well. I usually get the smoked meat poutine. It is amazing! The main reason I go to Bier Markt is the beer selection, which is fantastic. It gives you a chance to try something different. The staff is typically quite knowledgable about the various beers available. Another reason reason to visit is the patio! It's lovely in the summer! Make sure you go early, as the patio is first come first serve and you have to be quick to catch a table!"}
{"text":"This is a dimly lit and nicely decorated sports bar with hundreds of beers. I really enjoyed the booklet and explanation of what the different types were. There was even a glossary in the back to explain the beer terms for a non beer drinker. The also paired their meals with a beer.
They have special everyday. On Wednesday they offer 2 for 1 orders of duck wings and 25% off burgers and sandwiches. I had a double burger, which was really good. The cooked onions, bacon, and special mustard sauce went really well together. 
The I noticed the staff was all women except a male cook in the back. They were friendly and efficiently handled a issue I had while dining. I would eat here again. I do want to try these wings."}
{"text":"Solid food for the price. Yes it's high teens for a dish of pasta at a joint that advertises their drinks, but Ive found the food to be pleasantly savory. Kudos to the chefs back there and to the hostess who found us a seat within minutes on a Friday night. For draft beer it's Alexander Keith's. Freshest I've tasted outside of the Midtown in Halifax, NS."}
{"text":"Food appears to be warm, rather than hot. Not sure how long the staff waited on the counter until they brought it out. Drinks are standard; many interesting variety craft beer.  We had ordered desserts and hoping to have either cappuccino or espresso ... most restaurants would have these days. The waitress said we don't do cappuccinos here. Then was hoping maybe just espresso? Before she started offering her choices, she said , 'oh, I am having a brain fart ...!'. That was not one of the choices I was expecting. So I said, espresso? She then said yes and walked away. Moments after, she came back and said, 'oh, turns out we have Monte Cristo, do you want that?'. I was confused because I just wanted an espresso without any liquor. To make it easier for her, I said that's fine. When she finally delivered the 'Monte cristo', turns out to be espresso. She quickly dropped off without much explanation. Bill came, she charged Monte Cristo instead of espresso. Clearly she didn't know what she was serving. More training needed."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and generally enjoy it. I've never had a bad experience with service, they are normally attentive and polite but nothing above & beyond. The decor and atmosphere are really nice, their cocktails are delicious, and their patio is great in the summer (though you might have to wait a while to get a seat).

I only have two complaints:
1) The food is expensive for what you get. The portions are fairly small, and even though I've enjoyed the food, I'm not sure I enjoyed it enough to justify the cost.

2) A lot of the beer on their extensive menu is not actually available. Each time I chose a beer the server told me they didn't have it, eventually I gave up and got a cocktail instead. Not exactly what I was expecting from a place that's supposed to be known for beer."}
{"text":"I really like the franchise but this location, especially at lunch on a Saturday, the service was subpar. And, it wasn't busy. I decided to come here for lunch with a girlfriend and at first when you enter they greet you and immediately took us to our table, great beginning. Then we looked at the drink menu, can be overwhelming at first. We decided on our drinks, I got the Stiegl Grapefruit Radler, light and refreshing beer with a hint of sweet grapefruit,  great beer for those starting to drink malt beer. The waitress brought me something else and didn't return to the table. I had to get the bartender to switch it for me. Then I ordered fish and chips. The fish was deepfried and crispy on the outside,  and flaky on the inside. Fries were delicious. The so called slaw salad was tasteless with no dressing. Tell me how after a couple bites I was thinking something is missing.......the tartar sauce. I had to get the bartender's attention, as our waitress had vanished. They brought the tartar sauce and that completed my meal. Like I said, I love this franchise, but not this location for their lunch time service. I'll try it again at night, with the live band."}
{"text":"Comme son nom l'indique l'endroit est sp√©cialis√© dans la bi√®re avec un large choix de bi√®re du monde entier, Certaines en f√ªt alors que la plupart se trouve en bouteilles.

{"text":"I have been here on numerous occasions but this by far was the most disappointing visit. I am not sure if owners, manager or the cooks have changed but it has gone downhill. 

The food here is inconsistent. I usually order the Pastrami Flatbread and it tastes delicious, perfectly cooked and so forth. But this time, it looked like it was \"rushed\" and overloaded with pickle and \"uncooked\" onions. The manager was kind and replaced the meal free of charge. The server I had even mentioned someone else ordered the same item and it came out completely different. So I ordered the Chicken ABT and it was drenched with honey Dijon aioli making the bread fall apart and soggy. It looked hastily put together and wasn't appetizing. I can say that the frites that came with the meal was fresh at least. 

My friend ordered the Porto Fino mussels with frites. The sauce is tomato based and hers was clear and looked watered down. No sign of tomato sauce. There was no flavor as well. The frites were not fresh either and must have been sitting there awhile before serving it to us. Again, the manger replaced the mussels with a \"fresh\" order. Not all of the mussels were hot and the sauce usually is spicy which it wasn't at all and tasted merely mediocre. 

We didn't bother informing the manager because we honestly were fed up. We had to wait twice for our food and each time was not up to the usual standards of what I have had here before. I doubt I would waste my money here on the food. If you want to have a couple of drinks here and enjoy live music then go ahead but the food isn't worth it. 

Venture here at your own risk. 

I'm honestly disappointed because this used to be a favourite but not anymore."}
{"text":"I've been visiting their Queensway location for a year now and I can say that I love their Ahi tuna Burger. However, the quality of it hasn't been consistent for the past 4 times. It's either without the \"wasabi\" or whatever green sauce they put on the sandwich or it is not cooked as requested, or the tuna is not spiced up at all (neither salt nor pepper when the burger is made). Please pay attention to that because this may affect the satisfaction level of your clientele like for example in my case."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with food and service. Came here looking for a place for a late lunch and meeting some friends. Once seated we all ordered drinks while we waited for the last person to arrive. It took the waitress over 10min to bring out our first 3 beers. Didn't really matter much at this point as our friend had just arrived. 

We ordered a round of appetizers of calamari and beer can chicken flat bread and the other friend order his beer. Again it took around 10 min to bring out the one beer. The calamari was very good and came with 2 tasty dipping sauces. The flat bread was very disappointing. There was very little chicken and what little there was was overpowered by mushroom and cheese. The flat bread itself was thin, tasteless and the ends were rock hard and inedible. Over the hour we were there the waiter never check in on us until we were ready to leave. For the price we were very disappointed with the food. 

Unless your coming for the beer alone I wouldn't recommend it. Even then expect long waits for your drinks and poor refill service. We went elsewhere for our dinner"}
{"text":"I really like this place, good beer selection, and a very fun vibe.  I had my bachelorette two years ago and we ended up here, it was so fun I wished we had spent the entire night here.  If I was single I'd totally be all over this place, although it's great for beer anyways."}
{"text":"Came here for a guys night dinner before the boys hit the town. This was previously Cueue de Cheval and I always wondered what it was like inside as I never ate at CDC after hearing it was quite overpriced for what you received. The place is quite large with two levels and lots of TV's. We were seated at a big table at the left rear corner of the restaurant. It was a busy Saturday evening and the restaurant was alive. 

Beer selection is quite large and hence there is a book of many beers available on tap. For the beer lovers it's fantastic. 

Onto the food. I had selected bier can chicken and sp√§tzle soup. It was extremely salty but I still barely ate it. To the point of it being overkill. This is coming from someone who enjoys Asian food which is typically a bit higher in sodium content. I should have mentioned something to the server but was never asked how it was. 

For my main I had the big pot of mussels and fries. Which was delicious. Mussels were very fresh plump and the broth served was slightly salty but highly tasty. Fries were crisp, generous serving and went down the hatch no problem. This brought the meal back. 

My friends all ordered various dishes: charcuterie, the bratwurst board, steak, short rib, one ordered a burger. All were pleasantly pleased. From their reaction I'd say all of them enjoyed their meals were they blown away? I'd rank it as a 3.5/5 for a chain restaurant. Keep in mind pricing is medium high. Overall 3.5 I'd say is a fair rating. If you like beer and hearty man food it's your place!"}
{"text":"I loveeeeeeeeeeeeee the cheese fondue here. It's a great sharing plate good for two to three people and come with bread, green apple and potato balls. The fondue is wonderful blend of cheese and beer. Yummy! 

I also loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeee the mussles! Their mussel bowls are huge and served with demi baguette. You're going to have to ignore the carb count here! 

And I loveeeeeeeeeeeeee the beer selection! I've only tried like 2% of the choices on the menu but who cares. It's nice to have options. 

Yes, I love this place. Cheese fondue craving satisfied. Belly = happy ^__________^"}
{"text":"Bistro with great beer and great food and great atmosphere! 

Had the Pot of Moule Procencale here - a big bowl of mussels with herbs, shallots, garlic and white wine soup. Really really good. Comes with cripsy skinny handcut fries that were gone in minutes. 

Capon wings - comes in a plate of 8. They were somewhat small but really tasty and spicy! 

Their selection of beer is seriously overwhelming. It's listed by country and type. I got a light grapefruit cider. I forgot what it's called but it's basically a light fruity beer. Goes well with the mussels!"}
{"text":"Wonderful patio area, awesome selection of beer by country, good prices, crazy delicious spicy-meaty-well-marinated wings, tasty sausages with cheese, and the mac&cheese is so good you'll want to eat it for every meal.  I had a spicy stout from Sri Lanka which I've never tried before and went with the food really well.  Who says only wine pairs with great food?!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place.  They have a cool patio, huge beer selection (try the spicy Sinha Sri Lankan stout), and friendly staff.  I liked the cheese/sausage plate, wings, and chocolate cake."}
{"text":"The Beir Market is one of those places that I have been to many times but this was my first time going there for food. My girlfriend and I went to the Mississauga Christmas festival at celebration square and decided to stop here for some food and drinks. There was a 45 minutes wait but they gave us a spot at the bar to order some drinks while we wait. We ordered a cheese and meat plate and a couple drinks while we waited. I order the lucky Buddha beer which I was surprised was really good. For my main I ordered the pork schnitzel which was moist and tender. It comes with string beans, cabbage and potatoes which complete the plate. 

Overall I enjoyed the atmosphere of the Beir Market and would love to come back."}
{"text":"I think the Bier Markt reviews should be divided into two sections. 
1. Restaurant review
2. Nightlife review

Today I'm reviewing the Nightlife review and it was fantastic.

MUSIC
The music was fantastic. I really enjoy live music and the acts that play at the Bier Markt were very talented and had so much energy on stage.  Typically they perform covers of the top 40.

CROWD
The issue with this place is that if you're not there by 9/latest 10 on a Friday or Saturday night (spring/summer/fall), you are going to have to wait in line for an hour. The place is packed to the max.  The place gets so overcrowded at nights that ppl are spilling their drinks on you and it gets really hot.

I like the crowd. They are typically people in their early 20's to 30's. I didn't notice any skanky girls or douchey guys but I could have just been b/c I wasn't wearing my glasses. 

BEER
They had an array of beer. My favourite was the fruli. It's a fruity strawberry Belgian beer. 

BATHROOMS
The women's bathroom is a bit small but they have a nice full length mirror.  It's a bit difficult to use the mirror however b/c it's on a wall behind the door and when there is a line-up for the washrooms, everyone is covering it.  No biggie.

CAKE
I brought a cake in for my birthday and unfortunately they don't allow outside cakes onto the premises. They did store it for me until I was ready to leave.

I think if you're here with a group of friends for a night out, the place is a great b/c of the live music and the energy.  Just make sure you're aware that it's going to be super crowded."}
{"text":"Best cheese fondue ever!!!

Best beer sampler ever!!!!!!

YEAHHHHH I'M EXCITED!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent but service was very slow at first. I have to give kudos to the very attentive manager for noticing (on his own) that there was a problem. He quickly stepped in and remedied the situation and doted on us the rest of the time."}
{"text":"Awesome place to hang out! 

I lived in the area and went to Bier Markt numerous times. 

The staff is helpful and friendly. I had the seared tuna and mussels in the past, both lovely. Drinks are usually served fast and since I am not a beer drinker, I appreciate that they have a decent selection of wine. Love the decor and emplacement. Very intimate and great music!"}
{"text":"Not so great service, a patio on a busy corner with a lot of traffic, food that's not so great, and when seated inside while a band is playing, the volume level is atrocious.  It completely pales in comparison to it's Esplanade location."}
{"text":"How have I not written a review of this BM location? Anyway, I returned to the Esplanade location after 4 (or so) years. Great selection of beers and wines. Their menu is pretty good as well. Brunch items looked delicious; one of my Dining Companions had the schnitzel Benedict ... apparently it was amazing ! It looked amazing as well. I have to mention the service; it was excellent! I have to give kudos to the staff here. 

Anyway, it's always a good time at BM. I enjoy this place both during the day and at night. 

Good for: drinks, food, night out"}
{"text":"Amazing service. They messed up my husbands order by accident but the waitress was very attentive and with Ana amazing attitude through out the night. I'm surprised they're a 3 stars restaurant...I guess management is taking these reviews seriously and doing something about it because I couldn't have asked for a better service. Highly recommend. Great food and wide drink selection."}
{"text":"My first time to Bier Markt - not bad at all :)

I had the Fruli and Hoegaarden for my drinks - both of which were nice and light.  I tried the ribs as well as the Bier Can Chicken for the mains.  The ribs were smoked really well, where you brush the amount of barbeque sauce to your liking onto the ribs.  It was a TINY bit dry but mostly enjoyable.

The Bier Can Chicken.. I liked the cremini mushrooms a lot, and the Brie de Portneuf cheese.  The actual chicken was just alright, nothing too special.  However, four stars overall for good service and nice ambiance and filling noms :)

To try next time I come here:
The whole roasted pig.  And the fondue.  Mostly the whole roasted pig.."}
{"text":"I have had very different experiences at both Bier Markt locations-  this review is for this location only.  I much prefer the King st. location.  I came here for a group dinner on Saturday.  We had a reservation for 16-  17 people showed up, but we had a table that had a both running along one side and chairs on the other, so not really a problem to squeeze another person in.  As soon as the waiter sees this, he has a hissy fit about how squished how we are, and even though we are not squished and are totally fine he proceeds to go on for about 5 minutes about how to rememdy the situation.  Further more, our tables consisted of several small tables pushed together to make two large tables.  When I inquired as to why we couldn't push all the tables together and make one large table he refused citing a number of pointless reasons.  

The waiter, was super creepy, rude, condescending the whole time.  

The food was ok....a few people got the shrimp and scallops and everyone seemed to enjoy those however the rest of us did not enjoy our meals.  One friend had to send her fish back because it cold.  When it came back it was clear they just stuck the whole plate in the oven, microwave, some kind of warming device.  I had the Salmon which was ok, but sort of dry-  it came on top of some sort of potatoes which were cold-  I guess they plated the potatoes long before the Salmon.  A few people ordered the Chefs cut, which happened to be ribeye-  for $32 you got an overcooked steak that came off a buffet line.  

Around 9pm-  I got up to use the ladies room finding that the bar had turned into a club full of dbags and skanks (is this language allowed on yelp?).  Weird-  its a bar that serves 100's of beers- why turn it into a night club or a restaurant that serves over priced food.  

If you are in the mood to just chill out and drink some delish beers I would highly recommend the King st. location.  The bartenders/servers are super friendly and you don't have to deal with \"club bier markt\".  

The beer selection is of course wonderful and delightful, the beer is why I would go a restaurant called bier market in the first place."}
{"text":"I'm a beer connoisseur and this place was on point . Hundreds of brews from all over the world . The food and service was excellent and if you're looking for a great spot for sports stop by and grab a pint !"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is great - when you walk in, the hopps smell does take you aback :) but that is why it is a beer market. The beer is good, service was good. I ordered the NY strip streak - which was alittle underseasonded and I needed salf...otherwise, everything else was ok."}
{"text":"The schnitzel is to die for !  The braissere chicken is good however the portion is miniscule.  A better option is the spatchcock chicken for 2, which can easily feed 4 people if you grab an appetizer .  

I prefer the lager fondue over the cider fondue.  I'm not sure if its the cheese or the cider but it definitely has a texture that is a bit off, almost grainy. 

Charcuterie board is excellent.   Banana profiteroles are great too."}
{"text":"Good service but crappy quality food, first off the trio poutine which was $21 was cold, only the top layer where the gravy was it warm but underneath it was cold, not enough cheese curds and small portions....calamari taste like the frozen fishliner frozen dinners that you buy at Walmart, it was rubbery and soggy

Never going here for food again"}
{"text":"This place was totally packed when we went so I understand why service was slow. But it was SO slow! We ordered an appetizer when he came to the table for our drink order (the poutine tour). We only wanted to stay for an hour because we were going to the Canadiens game after dinner. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and was incredible. But our waiter didn't come back to take our order. We were completely done with our app and finished a round of beers and he was still not back. We then decided to just leave and eat something at the game so we asked him for the check. He came back twice to help the couple at our shared table, but didn't bring our check. When we asked him again, he said \"you want the check?\" \"Yes, yes we want the check\". Then we waited even longer and he finally showed up with the check probably around 15 minutes later. It was very frustrating. It didn't seem like we were asking for much. Being a waitress in a busy restaurant, I understand busy. But I know that printing out a bill takes literally 5 seconds. I would definitely try Bier Markt again, but will make sure to leave lots of extra time for the slow service. And the poutine tour was delicious- definitely a must-try. 3 different types: traditional, pastrami, and candied bacon - all 3 were incredible."}
{"text":"The food was overpriced compare to its quality. The burger was just dry and tasteless. It is a nice place to go for the beers though."}
{"text":"I love this place. Ridiculous amounts of selections of beer. Food is decent, try the duck wings"}
{"text":"Beer selection and atmosphere are great. Food sucks, everyone I know that's eaten there agrees. Oysters had a funny after taste, the sausage and pretzel were over done (although taken off the bill) I forget what we shared the last time but I remember my group all being disappointed (aside from the flatbread that's hard to mess up). Stick to a liquid diet, enjoy the beer and friendly staff."}
{"text":"In case you want to sit on the patio..  Well, bad choice.. So ignorant and the service sucks big time... An hour and still waiting for a single pint of beer & a glass of winter"}
{"text":"Awesome night scene. Band playing on a Thursday night, a HUGE selection of great beers. Place is really big, indoor and outdoor space. Can be loud a night, but if your there to watch a show or band, sound shouldn't be a problem!"}
{"text":"Interesting food selection.  Like their tapas style.  Great beer selection.  Love their beer pairing combos. Wayyyy tooo noisy tho. You also gotta fight for a parking spot."}
{"text":"This place is most definitely a Dr. Jekly and Mr. Hyde type of place...  It all depends on what you're looking for and what time of day/night you show up.

If you frequent clubs than go to this place Friday or Saturday night.  They have great beer, sweaty bodies and live music.

If you like up-scale dining and great food, then come on a Wednesday or Thursday evening after 7pm.

If you want to hang out with the barman and try lots of free samples of all sorts of interesting beers, then go for lunch on Sunday.  (Show up as soon as they open)

The after work crowd (4pm to 7pm) is always a pleasant time too for both beer, appys, and dining.

I've been many many times to this place and yes, some of the menu prices are outrageous, but the beer list will always keep me coming back."}
{"text":"This is more like a 3.5* then a 3*. We had our company team lunch here yesterday. There were 7 ppl in our group. This is an interesting place. Had 100+ beer available either on tap or bottle. The place was packed. Despite that the service was pretty good & so was the server. I had the lunch special which was 4 beef sliders & side of fries. The sliders were good but not enough beef to offset the bun! Otherwise no real complaints. This would be a great place to watch a football game."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time, and your money, of which you'll waste a lot. 

Service was just plain bad!!

Food was awful.  Cold and flavourless, YUCK!!

Chicken wings: $17
Supreme of Chicken: $23

PRICEY"}
{"text":"I've never been to this place any other time other than in summer. For some reason, this place, including Shops on Don Mill, loses its appeal when the weather gets cold. 
When this place was first opened, I had a ridiculous hard time trying to book seats for my friends and was never successful trying to door crash the place. (Although there were numerous times when I was offered a seat on lap of older gentlemen at the bar - to which I rejected.) My experience up to that point was very negative and I strongly disliked the place.
My perception on this place changed last summer when me and my colleague were able to score a seat on their patio in mid-afternoon one hot summer day. We had 2 dozen oysters with other appetizers and shared about 6 pints of beer with a good number of cocktails. Although there were still some older, perverted looking guys eyeing us in the not so far distance (two tables over), we had a good time. 
This experience made me wanting to go back again. So I did the following week. On the patio again, enjoying cold drink and juicy oysters.  
When the weather got a bit colder, I returned and sat at the bar side. I started to notice it wasn't as hard to score a table at this place anymore. My experience this time was rather dull and not that exciting. I found the indoor experience was not that different from other restaurant/bars. My exciting and vow to taste every beer off their menu soon died after I've tried most of the fruity/light beer that were more suitable to my taste bud. 
I will like this place, only in the summer. I will be back on the patio with a beer and an oyster in each hand."}
{"text":"The beer selection was off the charts varied. However, the food was both delicious and lacking all in two meals. We shared a charcuterie plate with kielbasa sausage (good), pretzels (two large ones that were delicious) and Brie cheese (they were out of the smoked Gouda). The Brie was a tiny portion (I mean really tiny) and was simply a low quality without any creamy texture and minimal flavor. I would suggest upgrading this item as there are some amazing choices out there. The fish and chips was well done with generous portions and the fries were great. The cole slaw side dish however was totally nondescript and flavorless. All in all, if you are a beer lover I would defiantly give them a try but don't have high expectations on consistent food quality."}
{"text":"Very disappointing in every aspect.  Starting with it taking a considerable amount of time to get service.  Ordered drinks and that took longer than it should.  

Two of us ordered fish and chips. Overdone and an incredibly small amount of fries.  When do you ever have too few fries?

No salt and pepper on the table.  Amazing how long it took to get the get a waiters attention to get some. 

Indifferent service and for the first time ever remember only tipped 10% which was a guilt tip since it was truly 10% more than deserved. 

So many choices of good places to eat or drink in the city find a place that deserves your money."}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Pretty attentive servers and bar tenders. But can get pretty loud on fridays and saturdays.

If you are picky beer drinker there is bound to be something here that you will like. We had the charcuterie plate which was so so. The burger bites were quite good. And the cheese fondue was also good. 

My only problem with this place is that it is expensive for what it is. There are plenty of other places that offer an extensive beer selection, and their per pint price is much lower. Food here is also pricey. But again, there are other nice gastropubs that do similar things at lower prices."}
{"text":"This is a bit tough to review because for the most part I enjoyed myself at Bier Markt, until later that evening when I got sick.   Unfortunately food poisoning is an automatic 1 star in my books. 

First the good.   The building is very nice. Its a new construction with a very classy retro interior, although their enthusiasm for all things Belgian is over the top (more on that later). We were seated on the second floor near the staircase.   They have 150 different types of beer, 30 or so on tap and the menu is really good about explaining the beers and providing food pairing suggestions.   A great place for those of us who support beer getting the same love as wine or scotch.   Our server was also very friendly and helpful, and food was delivered in a timely matter (too timely as it turned out).  We started by sharing a short rib Poutine that was excellent and for a main my girlfriend had a flammekouch (a pizza esque creation) that she said was excellent.   I went for the very Belgian moules frites in a white wine and shallot sauce.  Very promising.

Now the bad.  When I mentioned the food came too quick, it was because quite a few of the mussels were undercooked.   I am not a mussel connoisseur and I already had a couple of beers in me so I didn't really notice at first, I thought they were just really fresh.  When my girlfriend tried a couple she noticed the undercookedness, by which point it was too late.  Fortunately I have a tough stomach but two days later I am still feeling a bit nauseated.  It happens that sometimes a couple of mussels are not cooked but to have almost half of them is no good.  One last comment is that they are disturbingly enthusiastic about the peeing boy statue.  There is a giant replica on the front of the place and another overlooking the stairs, which have the statue pointed over your head, a tad creepy.

Its too bad that my experience ended the way it did because this place actually is pretty good, just avoid the mussels."}
{"text":"Been here several times over the years and it's been consistently good. Great bar staff. Wonderful selections and more than willing to give you a sample of the many beers they have on tap. The flights are good. The traditional burger is terrible. Upgraded to the Kobe which was remarkably better. Flat screens at the bar to catch the game. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here at about 3Pm on a Thursday. It wasnt that busy but we could tell that it must be really busy at end of the day, with all the office towers around it.

The waitresses we're all really nice and helpful. I had french onion soup and the bacon poutine. 

The soup was good and pretty filling for the price. Surprisingly this was my first time have a french onion soup and I really enjoyed it. 

The bacon poutine was also really good. The candied bacon was tasty and overall the poutine looked small but it was really good and filling. The gravy was tasty and the fries were perfectly cooked. 

We were there at an off time and all the food was great. 

The waitress quickly explained the beer tasting yo us although we didnt drink the entire process seems pretty cool and a good way to taste a lot of different beers. 

I will return here for sure!"}
{"text":"With such a strong focus on beers, you'd think that the staff would be knowledgeable and well-trained. We asked what the 'rotating tap' was and the waitress had no idea what we were talking about. She implied that 'rotating tap' was a brand of beer despite our efforts to explain the concept. Sheesh.

The food is very expensive for what it is. We all got larger appetizers and really liked the food, which is why I'm giving two stars."}
{"text":"This place has totally gone downhill since I first starting going here 2 years ago.
Last night I was there for the band/dancing part of the evening.

First off - when you make this much money, maybe you should invest in some air conditioning... come on. 

NOW..

I don't know where the security is in this place and exactly what their job involves.  
People can't handle their alcohol consumption and end of dropping their glasses on the floor which results in shattered glass on the dance floor.
Where is the clean up staff?  No they'd rather have their paying customers get cuts and glass spliters on their feet instead of being responsible and first off cut off the people that did it and ask them to leave, and secondly clear the area so that they can clean the spill.

This has happened on several occasions and it's quite common - it's not a one off. 
They don't believe in the safety of their customers because they probably think we're all drunk anyways and won't notice. 

Totally unacceptable and I will think twice before making this place my choice of a night out."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences I've had to date:

1. I reserved a table for 8 people and a waitress came to take out orders. I was halfway through stating my order when the waitress just randomly walked away. It took me 20 mins to wave her down and tell her that I didn't finish my order. She didn't even apologize. As a result, I got my food at least 30 mins after everyone else and this in itself made me irritated. 

2. Took forever to get any water and finally got it after raising my hand multiple times to get the waitress' attention. The first thing you should do as a waitress/waiter is to get your customers water or drinks. Clearly, this waitress didn't care. 

3. They have a 18% mandatory post-tax tip, which equals to 20% of your pre-tax bill. I'm against mandatory tip in the first place, but 20% is excessive.

Now I understand why we had such terrible service - the waitress knew that no matter kind of service she provided, she would get getting the tip regardless. This is exactly why I'm against mandatory tipping.

4. Food was below average. I ordered duck wings and it tasted like no-name chicken wings and they were slightly burnt. I ordered a charcuterie board and everything on it tasted like leftovers. The calamari had a very fishy taste.

Learn to respect your customers first and improve the quality of your food. For these two reasons, I will not be coming back here or any of the other Bier Markt establishments."}
{"text":"I would suggest this place if you and a friend want to have a few beers you cannot find elsewhere during an afternoon.  Would not advise for food or going there during night.  

Good: 
- very large selection of beer
- has a patio (on a street)

Bad: 
- Pretty expensive for what you get (beers are just slightly overpriced, food is overpriced.  $25 for a burger)
- Service is sub par


I went there twice for completely different types of events.  

Food and a drink on the patio:
- Service was ok, could have been better.
- Me and a friend ended up getting 3 small poutines to shares, it was ok, but pricy.
- patio was ok, turned my head a couple of times when people were honking....


Went with a large group for drinks on a Friday:
The place was pretty busy so we had a hard time finding a table.  We ordered a few drinks before we sat down.  Once we found a table, we asked 4 different servers to order beer, and they kept saying it was not their table.  We ended up going to the bar and ordering beer there. The beer was pretty expensive, Stella was around $8-9.  
Service was really bad, the ambience was very loud."}
{"text":"The service was pleasant enough but slow. The food for the price was awful.  I had a flat dry schnitzel that was hard to eat. Not moist and tbut Bret but like eating a fried piece of cardboard. The pasta side was also terrible. My friend had a steak and was not impressed. The beer samplers were good. Dessert was better but overall $165 for 4 at lunch was a waste of money. If this place is to succeed I suggest a major overhaul in the kitchen"}
{"text":"Love the patio in the summer. Staff is always friendly and attentive. Food quality is awesome, a little pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"Bier Markt is a solid bar that brings diversity in the downtown beer consumption scene. The collection of beers on tap from all over the world is impressive and this is my main motivation to come back to this place. Particularly my favorite Fruli strawberry beer from Belgium. They also offer some local brews from the best producers as DDC. I love the informative menu that would provide all the possible details on the beer types, it is educative in fact. 

The bar is perfect spot for after game pint or two, but I would not recommend before the game as the happy hour business crowd is still dominating the space, not my vibe really. The pub is spacious and the bars offer comfortable seats, my preferred spot being on the second floor. 

I haven't really tried the food except for few snacks, the poutine is nothing to write for, but the chicken wings are spicy and will drink another pint for you. Service may be spotty depending on the time and day, but sitting on the bar offers safety, the bar tenders would always make sure your glass is full. Strawberry cheers!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here after a Canadiens game since it was within walking distance and one of the only restaurants open late on the Monday. We arrived shortly after 10:30pm and we were sat immediately despite the busyness. Upon sitting we were told we had approximately 30 minutes to order from the main menu before they switched over to the late night menu at 11:00pm. 

I ordered a Somersby Cider which came in a tall glass with ice and the Chicken ABT sandwich. My friend ordered a cheeseburger and coke. I thought the food was really good, affordable, and it came out quickly for how busy they were. 

The reason I did not give five stars is because the meals weren't exactly as the menu described. My chicken sandwich was supposed to come with tomato, lettuce, chips, jalape√±o, and avocado but when I got it there was just lettuce cheese and bacon. Don't get me wrong the food was SO good, but I just don't understand why you would advertise one thing and give a customer another. 
The same thing happened to my friends cheese burger, it came out and instead of one patty with cheese there were two small patty's on top of each other which made it hard to eat. 

Overall, each of our meals and drinks were under thirty dollars and the food was very good. Considering the lack of restaurants open late around the arena on a Monday night I would certainly suggest Bier Markt !"}
{"text":"I went to this Bier Markt the first time on the recommendation of a friend who saw an ad for Belgian National Day celebration. Free beer on arrival (who can argue with free beer) and lots of free hors d'oeuvres going around were really nice on a small outdoor patio on a summer afternoon. The surroundings left something to be desired however: a quiet street without much traffic but a few cars parked, a graffitied wall, and the sound of some really lousy and definitely not Belgian live music.

Food here is touch and go; they really do try to provide a nice variety of gastropub-like options with a Belgian twist on a number of them but the execution isn't always 100%. I'm not a moules-frites guy so can't say much on the state of those. Items on special menus have been consistently good.

The variety of beer, however, is top notch. I hadn't yet found Delirium Tremens on draft anywhere since, well, Delirium in Brussels. The beer menu is helpful and extensive. And while I wouldn't go too nuts on some of the options offered, most look too good to be true and I'd trust Bier Markt to know what they're doing. Prices are a bit on the heavy side given a number of these can be found for quite a bit less."}
{"text":"I have been to the Esplanade a few times over many many years but this is the first time to Don Mills location and for dinner. I'd give 3.5. Would I go back yes. I had the Portobello mushroom burger. It was fine but not awesome. My friends enjoyed the schnitzel and battered fish. I did try some of the curry mussel broth and it was totally awesome. If I wasn't allergic to mussels that would be my choice. I love Pretzels at bars like this but there's were only ok compared to others. Chickpea dip was AWESOME. really. I was expecting more like hummus but pretty sure there was no tahini and it was smooth, and silky. Love it. Smoked Gouda - meh - goat cheese yum. Kimchi sausage didn't taste any kimchi. Beers and wine were great. Looking for something Sweet get the Berry Bramble. Service, all good in that category"}
{"text":"3.5*

I'm not exactly the first person to jump on these trendy \"let's go there for some post-work drinks\" chain restaurants, but honestly, not as bad as I thought it was going to be.

(YES, after work hours the crowd is mainly corporate, so just a heads up!)

Patio was a little more than 50% full and it seemed like a nice place to chill out.  It's set far enough away from City Centre Dr.  Inside had a different vibe, I thought it was quite dim despite it being sunny outside.  If you have a choice and it's nice out, sit outside.

Parking:  There is a gate for the parking lot in the back, but the gates automatically lift at 6pm, so essentially it's free in the evening.  Not sure how much it is if you have to park there during the day.

I'm just dabbling in beer and admittedly I'm more of a girly beer drinker, so I split the Sweet & Sour Flight with my friend ($25).  The flights came with 6 flavours are were about 1/2 pint each - if not smaller.  We're not heavy drinkers, so that was more than enough for the 2 of us!

We also split a Poutine Tour ($22) which featured all 3 flavours of poutine.  I thought it was quite good, but just the Classic alone would've been okay.  They more or less taste all the same - plus/minus a coupla ingredients.

I did not bother looking at the rest of the menu as that was enough food.  And there are different specials depending on the day of the week.

I'm very surprised that this is one of the few bars in the city that have flights, so definitely a good place to check out if you're a beer lover!  Server, Janelle was very friendly and informative, so I was quite surprised about that.  :)"}
{"text":"For a sports and beer kind of joint, I was impressed! One of my friends ordered oysters... and actually got me to try them!! At a pub!! I'm usually a very picky guy, never thought i'd eat oysters anywhere else other than an upscale restaurant, but here we are. I actually ordered a plate for myself afterward. They were on a special too, a buck an oyster, compared to their usual 3$. Only downside is our food came all at different times, so it was a little awkward, half of us didn't want to eat infont of the other starving half, so some were sharing (that's how I ended up trying the oysters) some were waiting for everyone to get their food, so we ended with cold food ourselves, it's not our waitress' fault, the place was busy, and we were a big table, so I'm sure they were doing their best. We'll be back though, maybe a bit after the lunch rush next time, but we'll be back!"}
{"text":"lame service. rude/bossy waiter, disorganized service and over priced beer. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"The food here is really good but the service is terrible.
 
We had the Pastrami Poutine and Baked Brie--both were delicious. We weren't too hungry so the serving size was really filling, but otherwise I would say that the serving size for the meals are perfect for accommodating drinks, not for filling you up. We got two cocktails, Rose Bellini and Strawberry Daiquiri, instead of just beer. Definitely recommend the daiquiri, not the bellini.
 
But aside from the food/drinks, what I really want to point out is the terrible service. When we arrived, there were 3 hostesses at the front and NONE of them even bothered to look up or greet us when we got in. Once we got their attention and got seated, they told us that our waitress would be with us shortly. We waited at least 15 minutes and no one came to take our orders. Finally, we stopped a waitress walking by and she told us that she's not our server and pointed out to us the girl that was supposed to be our server. Well, our assigned waitress just never came to our table so we ended up giving our orders to another waitress that walked by. Then at the end, when we asked for the debit machine to pay the bill, we had to wait around 10 minutes for it to come... and guess what? It was finally our assigned waitress coming to give it to us. Anyways, I checked the receipt and it said that we had been served by Ally but I don't even know which one of them was Ally.
 
I really can't stand bad service so the lack of communication between its employees at this location really ticked me off. Not going back again."}
{"text":"Hoped to get lucky for a table on a Saturday night and got there. They managed to squeak a table of 2 in at around 7pm. They do take reservations as I spied some tables with reserved signs and saw a back room had been cordoned off via a curtain for a party.

There's a huge beer selection and we were lucky enough to be seated by the wall of beer in the back that is impressive to look at. Don't be tempted to actually come up and take something off the wall as we watched a few folks try to do that and get sent back to their tables. The one disappointment is that their seasonal rotating beer wasn't available yet so we had to opt for something else. Makes me question just how much is actually available on their extensive menu. 

We shared a couple of appetizers instead of ordering our own entrees:
1. Classic Poutine - Your traditional poutine with a rich brown gravy and squeaky cheese curds. Yummy thick cut fries. 
2. Bacon Poutine - Surprisingly good! Probably not a true poutine but had big bacon cuts and the creme fraiche worked well to cut through the saltiness of the bacon.
3. Duck Wings - These were big, meaty, and frenched like their other wings. Both sauces were really nice."}
{"text":"The two beers I tried were spot on! The crab dip was yummy and exactly what was described. But I am a single female and I sat at the bar. I felt ignored by my server. When I left the tip she asked me if everything was ok. I said no and that I felt ignored. She said she was sorry that I felt that way. I understand she was busy. But she was conversing with other people at the bar but not me. Also she presented the pay machine without asking me anything else. It was only after seeing the 10% tip that she asked or ever looked at me. I should note that going into a sports bar as a single female can be intimidating and I may be being overly critical for a server that is not used to patrons such as myself."}
{"text":"Really great place to socialize, big patio.

Great selection of beers and good live music on Fridays.

Food is overpriced - but the ambience and beer make it worth it."}
{"text":"J'ai vraiment appr√©ci√© cette place, nous avions fait une r√©servation et nous avions un superbe endroit dans un coin au second √©tage. 

Le service a √©t√© magnifique, notre serveuse √©tait super attentionn√© et √† l'√©coute ce qui √† fait le plus grand plaisir de notre tabl√© de quinze personne. 

Le d√©cor est √©galement sympathique, beaucoup de bois comme un pub classique mais avec un petit air classy grave √† la d√©coration, ceci dis on a vraiment l'ambiance pub avec les multiples TVs et la place √©tait bond√©.

Pour finir la nourriture, j'ai pris le burger veggie avec champignon portobello accompagn√© de frites classique, le burger √©tait bon et les frites aussi mais rien de particuli√®rement extraordinaire. J'ai aussi pu go√ªter leur rondelles d'oignon et leur pretzel, puis boy que c'√©tait bon. Ils avait aussi un special hu√Ætre √† 1$, ce qui vaut le d√©tour si tu aimes les hu√Ætres."}
{"text":"Live tunes, great food, amazing selection of beer!  One of my favorite chains and I say that rarely since I'm more of a one of a kind type of guy.  If you're a super fan of very select beers you need to be here!"}
{"text":"So I tried to get a reservation at the Bier Market and all I can say is the process is really complicated. All I did was inquire about a reservation and then I got a huge email explaining their \"rules\" and on top of that 2 documents to fill out Getting my mortgage was easier than making a reservation at the Bier Market. What ever happened to calling and say I would like to make a reservation and the place just took your information.

I don't hate the Bier markt but i don't think i would ever try to make a reservation when I am planning an evening"}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday party and the wait staff cramed 15 people around one small table. When we asked for more they just said no....the staff at this bier markt is very unwilling to assist anyone...i am extremely disappointed in my experience at this bar....and the wait staff needs more training in customer service"}
{"text":"Inspired by the sunshine, making patio season finally tangible, some friends and I stopped by The Bier Markt last weekend for a few afternoon brewskis. 

We sat out on the patio briefly until the sun started to set and then went inside down a flight of stairs into what looked like an old Italian man's basement. I'm not sure what they were going for with the ambience, but I can't imagine it was that. Aside from the kind of dismal setting, the place was great! 

Our server was lovely - very kind and friendly. She helped us navigate through the EXPANSIVE beer menu and made some very apt recommendations.

Great selection, great service, all the Bier Markt needs is a bit of a facelift!"}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper today at the Bier Markt.

We sat in the sun on the patio.

Gord ordered Fish & Frites and swapped his fries for onion rings.  He said it was delicious.  I had a bite of his fish and it was!  We'd both get it again.

I ordered a Markt Burger (without letuce or onions).  It was a good burger and I'd get it again.

Natalie was our server and she was friendly."}
{"text":"1 star for having gluten-free beer: La Messagere

1 star for having delish fondue that was served fast

1 star for the walkable layout, long bar, & dancefloor. 

(-1) star for said fondue being insanely expensive, with not enough vegg.

(-1) star for not embracing the German biergarten feel, but rather trying to make this a hoaxy hotspot/club. Andrew sums it up well in an earlier review.

I was also disappointed when the DJ stopped and the cover band came on, but I think I'm the one person on Earth who doesn't like live rock music. So being an anomaly I'm considering this point a wash."}
{"text":"Ok It might be a bit expensive

But they do have some great beers from around the world.

And I tried one of their Flammekueche and I have to say that it was just great and a decent size too.

For 20$ you can get a beer tasting of 6 different brews and that's worth it !

Lots of Tvs to watch the games during the world cup or some popular sports events, great service and... Well that's already a lot."}
{"text":"The worst food ever. We used to go to the location on Esplanade 5 years ago when we lived nearby. We had great memories of the Congo mussels and dipping the bread in the sauce was divine! But this time around, it was a disaster.  We ordered the French Onion Soup ($9), Calamari ($13), Mussels + Frites ($22) and Summer Nights $7 (a blend of fruity beers or something). 

The best thing was (OBVIOUSLY) the beer concoction. The French Onion Soup was disgustingly sour, wreaked a bit of \"this has been sitting for days\" and had hardly ANY CHEESE. Sadness settled at that point. The calamari was crispy. That is all. But then the mussels.. The mussels we had high expectations for but they came out almost cold and the meat was tiny and shrivelled up. We had it sent back and received a \"fresh\" batch but the only real difference was it was hot.  

Our server was great but the food was so beyond awful. I looked over to the other table and noticed they hadn't ordered any food, but just drank beer. Wise people. Come for the interesting drinks but NOT THE FOOD. Save your money and spend it elsewhere. There are SO many good places to choose from in the area, I'm sure."}
{"text":"This bar is a nice place to come and have a casual good time with friends and even family, but do not expect anything special. The only reason I came here was because Joey's across the street didn't take reservations on a Friday night and had a 1.5hr waiting list. GOODBYE!

I tried a new beer - well not new to the market, but new to me! \"Lions Winter Ale\" I think it's local to Vancouver. It was really tasty. It had notes of coffee and chocolate which was very interesting. The vibe here was super relaxed. There was a live band playing when I arrived. They played GNR which was a plus for me :D We also orders a platter of 7 items for $35. I thought that was a great deal... but each item was only the size of two bites lol.

Eventually the live band retired for the night and the DJ came on stage. The DJ looked like he was straight out of high school and played of a list on Spotify. It wasn't anything special which was unfortunate as I was really looking forward to the DJ.

I had an okay experience, but there are many other bar that offer the same products and services The Bier Markt overs for a highs value."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan! Fantastic beer menu, and great food. The portions are massive. 
Had the Vienna Schnitzel, which was the size of my not my everyday head, but my ego-inflated head!
Also had to Filet Mignon which was the special for the evening. They do specials every night, and this was the Chef Special of the evening. The steak was like butter to cut through, and was very well presented.

Sooooo happy to see they have Paulaner, on tap!! 

It is a bit dangerous that this is across the street from where i live haha 

RESERVATIONS ARE A MUST RIGHT NOW.
They are very popular, and to get a seat took people 1.5 hours without a reservation!
You can go to the bar, but if you want to have dinner, call a few days ahead.

-1 star for not using Open Table.
I love everything about this place, but doing reservations through their own website is a pain in the butt, have to wait for them to call you back. I made one reservation, but screwed up on the time, so had to make a 2nd reservation, and that led to a bit of confusion for the girl who called back. There could be such better use of someone's time than calling people back for their reservation. Catch up Bier Markt.

Otherwise, i can see myself drinking and eating here frequently."}
{"text":"Negative experience. Even though their food seems to be fine, it takes forever to get your order or bill. The most interesting thing is such a slow service tends to happen regardless of a waitress serving you."}
{"text":"The Bier Markt is my little slice of heaven on earth.
Amazing live bands, a great vibe, atmosphere, and layout, a big dance floor, and nice staff. 
I love everything about this place and have so much fun when I go here.
There's no cover but there can be long lines so I suggest getting there before eleven.
There are so many different beers on tap, I like the one that's lever is a goose head, though the name escapes me.
I haven't tried the food here and we couldn't get a table when we were there at about 11, it was full.
The washrooms were clean and the lines if there were any moved quickly.

Security guards kept the access to the washrooms clear as well.
I never leave the front of the dance floor when I'm here. 
I'm basically the biggest fan of whatever band is playing.
I love it here.
Soooo much better than the one on King West which I will probably never go to again."}
{"text":"Walking into the Bier Markt, I was not expecting good food but rather good beer. Needless to say, I went for the food and not the beer. 

We went around lunch and it was not busy at all. The pub is located a few steps underground. The lighting was ideal from where I was sitting. I have to commend the server at our table. He was so gracious and witty. He seemed like he actually liked his job. I really appreciated the cleanliness of the place. I also liked that the washroom was on the same floor as the dining tables. Usually, washrooms downtown are in the basements. 

I cannot speak to the beer and drinks here but what I can talk about is the food. First of all, waiting time was \"normal\" and not out of the ordinary as you would expect at a pub downtown. The \"duck wings\" surely caught my attention. But I ordered the most mouth watering chicken wings instead. 

Nicely presented; clean and crisp. I got about 8 wings for around $15. These wings were so mouth watering. I'm still salivating thinking about them. They were dusted in a siracha dry rub which makes you want to eat pounds and pounds of them endlessly. 

Gratuity was already calculated in the bill due to the table number - that's standard I guess. The overall impression I got from my coworkers around the table was that I should be giving the experience 5 stars! 

Overall, I would definitely visit the Bier Markt again for those dry run chicken wings. You should too! Go for the wings and stay for the beer!"}
{"text":"I had never been to Bier Market for food, as several of my musician friends had played gigs there, and I had only attended for the amazing beer selection.  But as part of a CMYE, Bryan c. and I decided to go to the Fond√ºe Feastiv√ºl.  Shortly after we were seated, Kat. F mentioned that we had to be done by 9:30pm for when the restaurant transitioned to the club mode I was familiar with.  I didn't foresee that being a problem, but I knew the type of crowd that would be in attendance.

Of the four choices for cheese fondue, we ordered three: 
1 Smoked Danish:  Quite tasty, but the bacon garnish on top was overkill for flavour.  When you're using a smoked cheese, you   don't need to bring the bacon.  
2 Cheese and Lager:  The most disappointing of the three.  It was alright, but boring and bland.  I find that packaged supermarket versions of fondue are more flavourful than this dish.
3 Chevre:  Very dry aftertaste, but lots of flavour and not as much sodium as I thought would result in such a recipe.

General complaints about the fondue:
-the fondue itself was served lukewarm, so we often found ourselves having to stir it.  I think perhaps the rechauds were not big enough/hot enough.

-it also wasn't thick enough, from my experience, which leads me to believe they skimped on how much of the cheeses they used, adding plain old milk as filler.

-the baguette they served for dipping was \"fresh\", as written on the menu.  Baguette for fondue should be crispy, not fresh.  In fact, when I've had fondue in Europe, the bread was either slightly toasted after cutting/ripping, or it was left out to stale slightly before serving.  They also didn't serve it with enough bread.  There should always be enough bread to use all the cheese, to a point where la religieuse (toasted cheese) is exposed, and can be peeled out and eaten.  I've had it served before, where the waiter regularly asked us if we needed more bread (free of course), so perhaps it was our fault for not asking for more, but I think I wanted to see if they offered it first.

-If you're developing fondue recipes for a restaurant known for its amazing beer selection, couldn't they have thought of a more interesting beer than Stella Artois to use for the Cheese and Lager fondue?????

-Cornichons, grape tomatoes, asparagus, herb fritters, etc., were some of the common dippers also served.  I was happy to see the cornichons for tradition's sake, but missed some of the other regulars like apples and potatoes.

-Only one of the 4 fondues was diluted with alcohol.  I would have liked to see more interesting pairings, especially from a place like Bier Market, because they have access to so much.  

The dessert fondues were basic.  Chocolate and caramel/toffee, served with a selection of cookies, and not nearly enough bananas and strawberries. Super rich, sweet fondues are best served with tangy fruits, for the contrast and balance.  The cookies were overkill, but good on their own I suppose.  The bananas tasted green, even through the sweetness of the chocolate.  Oh, and the dishes were all served without the rechauds lit.  One of MANY service-fails that evening.  That being said, our waitress scored points with me for her product knowledge.  I had ordered a couple bottles of √âph√©m√®re (Apple) beer from the Unibroue brewery (Quebec).  They are likely most well known in Ontario for La Fin du Monde.  I'd never had it before, but figured it would be a good pairing.  After my first bottle, the waitress asked how I liked it, and was able to offer up information on the distinct brewing process, the label artwork, the history, and recommend similar products.  Very impressed.  Would have loved to see that beer used in one of the fondues.  I might just make my own, after a road-trip to the Quebec border.

The Yelp party headed out around 9pm, but Bryan C. was already pointing out the very noticeable change in demographic that was filing in slowly.  The 2 of us stayed to finish our beers and let our food settle.  During this time, who I assume were the manager and a member of the waitstaff, came over to remind us we had to be out by 9:30pm, while other staff members pulled the table cloths off the now empty adjoining tables, and carted them off.  It wasn't a pleasant experience, and I hate being pressured.  We each had maybe 250mL of beer left, and the food had been cleared, so it wasn't like we looked like we were in it for the long-haul.  Working in the bar industry, as I do, I think it's quite sad when you make it painfully clear to your dinner guests that their $50 spent on a quality dining experience is not as important as the $20/person avg of your soon to be messily intoxicated crowd.  

I don't think I would consider eating here again.  It's great for the beer.  Take out?  ;)"}
{"text":"Good: The beer selection is vast. Overpriced, but it's nice to try some non-standard suds. 

Better: The dancefloor only starts looking fun after a few of the aforementioned beverages. It's definitely obnoxious if one isn't in inebriated party-time mode. Granted, that wasn't a problem for me. The thirtysomething crowd is mixed (locals, tourists, bachelor/bachelorette parties) and by the end of the night, everyone seems to be bopping away. 

Best: The live band on this particular Saturday night was cranking out hits of 90ies. Any band that incorporates Mr. Vain and Rhythm is a Dancer into a medley is going to be playing at my wedding. They were awesome!

The UnGood: 
1. They had the fake lineup farce happening on a cold winter night. Not appreciated. 
2. The front-of-house staff were rude and unreasonable when my friend lost his coat check tag. Unfortunately, this tarnished an otherwise enjoyable evening. Perhaps I'll return in the summer when this is less of an issue. 

Funds: No cover, $50 for 4 Oktoberfest-style pints."}
{"text":"I go here once a week. This week I dined on fries and then a steak. They were awesome to give me a different potatoe than more fries!

I sat next to a couple that was incredibly picky. The woman was newly pregnant (yes, I overhear stuff) and didn't want unpasteruized goat milk. The gentleman said that he always had an upset stomach after eating at Bier Markt. I don't know what is wrong with his stomach - cause the food is great.

It may be pricey - but it isn't risky. And when you go out with picky eaters or my friend, the biggest lover of poutine ever, you need more options. 

George is a funny waiter. He didn't remember us for the longest time and then finally he comes by and asks us, \"where is the party at?\" This made my dinner companion very happy.

Overall - it is a winner because it is consistently good. I would rather pay 10 bucks more for dinner here than any of the other pubs in my King West hood."}

{"text":"The Beir market is only good for a little night life. I have tried eating at 3 locations now and the food feels like the are trying really hard to be unique but are missing the idea of a complete dish. There's no balance to there food. The flavours don't come together at all. Never mind that its over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good!

Had the bier markt burger which is good and the fries are great. Had it 2 times before but the merchant burger is way better but its 9 bucks more if you feel ballin (but it is wagyu)

The rest of the party had the fish and chips, and the steak frites which I'm told were excellent and i tried, so verified good.

Server was super nice, worth checking out if your in the square one area. 

They also show the raptors game, so bang bang extra points."}
{"text":"I am a local from Montreal. Some people say the poutine is amazing... I was with a bunch of people who chose this and it is NOT good. They were all disappointed. Go to la Banquise instead. I had a burger and it was not cooked inside. Service was very long and the waitress was completely lost in the orders. Go to  Hurley's, McKibbins or Old yer Orchard instead of paying too much for lower quality food and service."}
{"text":"Only into for one day and our hotel concierge recommend us taking a cab to Bier Makert. It was great. The appetizer were good. I had the Brie with apple and pecan and also the Poutine. They were both great. We could not stop eating them even when our dinner came. I ordered the burger that was a big as my face and was super flavorful!! I ended up getting the sweet and sour beer flight and that was super good...especially since I'm not a huge beer fan. I barely had room for dessert but decided to get the chocolate cake to go. It was pretty good. Great sauce. Overall, I would go there again and wish there was a place that cool and good here in the U.S.!!"}
{"text":"I came here with friends on a Saturday.  I left the place at 9pm and there was a line up that went all the way to the outside. So come here early if you can.
Selection of beer is amazing!! Will not disappoint if that's what you're coming here for. 
Food was good, I recommend the capon wings (for those who like it spicy).
The downside to this place is that it seemed understaffed. Great servers who worked their butts off but just not enough of them to get timely service."}
{"text":"3.5 !  Service: 4, Food: 3

We were here with a large group (30 ppl) and we got to sit around the bar area (they set up 3 long tables) right in front of the band too! They had a set menu for us so it was almost like summerlicious/winterlicious set up. If you enjoy beer you would love this place as it had a HUGE beer list. I believe our group spent a great deal on alcohol.

Food wise, it was about average but the service was excellent. 

Really not bad for a party. The staff was very accommodating as well. Reservations definitely required. They are super busy esp on weekends !! Ah... the new posh yuppie area to be"}
{"text":"Very nice place. I enjoyed the patio a lot. 

Great location and free parking at the back. This was on a weekend and the gates were up. I'm not sure how it works on weekdays. 

I got the flatbread pizza with beer can chicken and Brie cheese. Tasted very good and came out super quick. 

Service was great and all the servers were friendly. You can tell they were new but that's ok. 

My main problem is the menu and the amount of choice. Crazy amount of beers on tap and in bottle. It gets to be a little overwhelming. They had to explain a bunch of things to my party and I as some of the food was not in English. 

I had fun and had a great server so I will be back again."}
{"text":"Three stars is exactly what this place deserves. We came here for brunch, I know not exactly what this place is known for, on a Saturday before the World Cup of Hockey game. We literally were the first ones here and Bier Markt is a big place so we felt even more alone. Our server wasn't really attentive but who could blame here, we were her only table for an hour before others came in. 

The food was OK. I had the egg white omelette that comes with a lot of toast. My girlfriend had this decadent french toast loaded with chocolate syrup and bananas. Hers came with maple syrup cut with espresso which I kept dunking my bread in to make my own fake french toast. I was surprised when my cousin who was feeling under the weather asked to order just a plain waffle because the one of the menu came with a bunch of things that she was worried would upset her stomach. Our waitress responded with \"No we are corporate about that kind of thing\" which was so surprising to us Americans. Not sure if that is a Canadian thing but wouldn't good business be serve a plain waffle, appease your customer, with less food and charge the same price? Stupid business plan there. 

I had a few beers to start and had one of the flights. It was fun that each beer had a fun description on the menu that my cousin read off to me every time I switched to a new one. My other cousin got their chicken sandwich which looked delicious but the \"poutine\" ask a thing of fries with little gravy and some cheese was really underwhelming. Overall, I might come back in the evening for the beer but not the food."}
{"text":"just walked into this restaurant randomly.. well i've heard of it before but since i was at shops at don mills anyways AND i realized they had it there.. i decided to try it WITHOUT any expectations of it being good (or bad).

it turned out to be quite good! we ordered a pea soup, platter of sausage, cheese and pretzels, smoked meat poutine, smoked chicken flat bread and some sort of pork cutlet with pasta... i forgot the actual name but thats what it was.

i donno if i was hungry or what not but everything tasted LEGIT. the pretzel had a smoked flavour to it, it was chewy yet soft. the pork cutlet with pasta was not bad but they could've just called it pork cutlet instead of the fancy name they gave it. it was fried pretty well, crispy on the outside yet not too oily! the flatbread was tasty! it was crispy and cheesey.  the best part is the beer, its four dollars for a cupful AND you get to keep the glass cup! coooooooool"}
{"text":"The over atmosphere wasn't bad but the food wasn't great. I had ordered a filet and what came out was not that. I decided to try it anyways but it wasn't that good. At least they offered to recook it but what I really wanted was the cut that I ordered. They do however have a variety of beers which was a plus."}
{"text":"If your looking for a great place with a lot of selection of different beers from around the world give this place a try. They also have some live music which can be pretty loud , you can't really have a conversation with whoever your with. 

I tried a beer from Japan, I can't really remember the name but it was okay nothing to brag about, they also serve food but to be honest it didn't look appealing."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers. A lot of variety. Very organized menu. Situated centrally. An easy walk from the metro station and my hotel. Lots of seating space and TVs. Service could've been a bit better. Very touristy. The food was not bad. We enjoyed our calamari. Overall, we didn't have any complaints about the food. Ambiance was a bit loud for me. It you like beer, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 12 so we ended up ordering a good portion of their menu.

Let's use the hamburger method for feedback here.  

So negative: hamburgers. They were average and small for the price.  Even worse was anything tuna related.  I got a rare tuna entree and my co worker got a rare tuna burger.  He specifically said sizzle each side for a few second thats it.  both our fish came almost fully cooked.  Do not order anything fish related as they obviously don't know what they are doing.  Lastly, appetizers, they were so small in portions that I thought they were from the kids menu.  Crab dip comes with 4 thin slice of bread, seriously?

Positive: Poutine tastes great, so does the sweet potato fries.  Mussels were good.  

Things to improve on:  Sweet potato fries were good but also cost $8 for a side dish.  Mussels were good but they came in a pot where you can't get any of the sauce until you finish the mussel already. Appetizers need to increase in size to be worth ordering.  Stop over cooking the fish and respect the ingredient."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection, on draft and in bottles.  Excellent food, and reasonable price.  Definitely a place to stop on your trip to Montr√©al!"}
{"text":"Do not advise anybody to go here - I usually find it difficult to give out negative reviews because I can understand sometimes thing go wrong, but our food was dry and burnt and when we complained to the manager, they said it was supposed to be like that... the rib meat was hard as a rock. There are better places in the area, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Awesome burger sliders, brussel sprouts and sausages. Has the largest beer selection by far. Service is wonderful and the ambience is chill and casual, definitely a place to enjoy after work and chill with friends."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss. 
Not too crowded on a weeknight. 

VIBE 
Usually crowded. It has a bit of a club vibe with the live music. The live music at the King location is much less cheesy than that of the Esplanade location. 

WE ATE/DRANK
The food is not bad! I would rate this food \"great first date\" material snacking. 
We split the Wurst Sampler for 1 and it's a good size if you are not too hungry. If you are  hungry, get the sampler for two. 

It consists of: 
Bratwurst, smoked bavarian and spicy sausage
gouda 
sour pickle
pretzel 
mustards

I really liked this dish. The sausage was well cooked and had great flavour. The pretzel was fresh out of the oven and soft and the mustards had some kick to them. 
Of course, I'm a dill pickle girl at heart, so this was a nice addition. 

I wanted to try something different and Das Boot was a great choice. It was a good light blonde beer that comes in a glass that's the shape of a boot. It's popular and I recommend it. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
I learned that though this is a European Beer market, \"going dutch\" is not in my vocabulary, especially on a first date. Dealbreaker. 
Otherwise, great place!"}
{"text":"They have an amazing variety of beers. The mussels are just incredible. And also, the Bavarian pretzels. Exactly like in Germany. A great place to hang out, watch a game or listen to love music. Patio is smoker friendly."}
{"text":"Great service and good food. Definitely check it out for brunch. The waitress we had was really sweet. Kept coming back to fill our waters and make sure we had everything we needed. All the brunch items were great, and they have a pastry chef in house who makes all the desserts from scratch. We got the little donuts (4 of them) that came with a coffee dipping sauce. Served warm and tasty! 

Can't wait to check out the patio when it is warmer!"}
{"text":"Went to the Queensway Bier Markt for brunch/lunch last weekend to celebrate friend's birthday. We love to eat so the 3 of us gals ordered 5 meals to share.

We ordered from both the brunch and lunch menu.

To start we ordered the Bread and Butter grilled brioche bread, Gruyere cheese and black pepper popovers, compotes du jour for 6 dollars (on the brunch menu). I really enjoyed the compotes (berry was the best, then they also had a kiwi and peach/tangerine that were both yummy on the popovers. The brioche bread was just ok. Not bad but nothing spectacular... But I am a bit of a bread snob...

2nd item to start was the fondue found on the lunch menu for 21 dollars. Cheese and Lager fondue - Appenzeller, Emmental and Raclette cheeses, stella artois lager, granny smith apple, rosti croquettes, bistro bread (similar to a baguette). This dish was fun and tasty but very rich! Probably better with more people as we had to leave a lot of it. The rosti croquettes were awesome and the apples went well with the fondue. I also enjoyed putting some of the compotes from the previous dish on the baguette with cheese. 

We then ordered 3 mains to share:
B and B breakfast sandwich for 16 dollars which is fried egg, alberta boar burger, maple glazed bacon, sherry onion jam, toasted classic bun, baby arugula salad, olive oil vinaigrette. This was one of the faves. The egg yolk was perfect (soft) and the maple glazed bacon was perfectly sweet. 

Breakfast Greens for 14 dollars - 2 poached eggs, smoked bacon, sauteed mushrooms, butter lettuce, kale and baby arugula, grilled bistro bread was disappointing but could have been because we ate it last and it was cold by then. My friend had ordered it in the summer and said they were much better (better mushrooms and bread).

The 3rd main was the smoked meat flatbread pizza (14 dollars). House smoked beef brisket, sweet and smoky mustard, shaved cider slaw, emmental cheese, roasted garlic. I would rate this a 3. I enjoyed the brisket but felt the slaw was very dry. Still enjoyable but had higher expectations.

All in all a great experience, great service, yummy food and 100 dollars for all 5 dishes once you add tax and 20 percent tip. If you go for brunch, try the breakfast sandwich and if you have a decent size group, the fondue is fun. For 6 bucks the popovers and compote was yummy but beware there are only 2 popovers (and 4 slices of toast). Please note that I took pictures of all the meals listed above for your viewing pleasure! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Huge selection of beer (150). Went on a Thursday night and waited about 30 minutes with a group of 4 guys to get our food (we all ordered burgers). One of the burgers were sent back since it was overcooked and waited an additional 20 minutes to get the new order. 

Convenient location in downtown Montreal however the excessive ticket time on food during a week day reflected the 3 star review."}
{"text":"Dropped in here late on a sunny afternoon. 

Great patio, good service & nice menu. 

We ordered two mains - the schnitzel was *really good. 

But 3 mains + 1 bottle of sparkling water (no booze) left us with a $65 bill (before tip) not what I expect from the neighborhood bier market - comparable businesses in NY charge less than half for the same product."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience here with customer service.  We had a bon appetit gift card that we were unsure would cover bier markt, so we called the location to make sure. We were careful to describe the card and the person on the line assured us that it would absolutely be covered since they were all under the same company.  By the end of the night we were informed (as they were handing us a card machine) that the card did not in fact cover the cost as it was an older card before bier markt joined the company.  After complaining that we had been informed otherwise,  the manager only took off the cheapest item off our order.

I had also ordered the ahi  tuna steak,  but after a long wait time the waitress served me while hurriedly explaining that they had \"run out of tuna,  but this was the same meat and they were charging me for the burger price which was much cheaper and more meat anyways\". Confused,  I began to eat what turned out to be a tuna burger patty on top of the steak sides. They had substituted my order without asking or informing me that they were out of what I had actually ordered. It tasted like mushy off beef like fish paste without the bun. 

Did not tip, will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Went to Bier Market for a friend's birthday. Wasn't expecting there to really be anything for me so I ate in advance (I'm so prepared).
As I assumed, the only \"safe\" things on the food menu were salads. No thanks. I've had enough salads to last me a lifetime. It's pretty much the standard response at any place that doesn't have gfree options - well, you can have salad. 
Anyways! My friends who did eat seemed to really enjoy their food so Bier Market appears to have the food part down pat - and more so than a bar would. It's much closer (if not spot on) to restaurant fare at a chain. Definitely not bad! 
The drinks - obvi what people come here for. So they did have gfree beer, but I don't actually like beer so that didn't appeal to me. They did however also have some yummy ciders. I had a Somersby cider and it was delicious. They have a whole page dedicated to the gfree world, which I appreciated. The beer menu itself is over 40 pages so they have variety up the wazoo and something to please everyone. So whether you're looking to be social, to experiment, to taste-test or to just drink a lot of beer, Bier Market is where it's at. They even have tasting options to order several beers at once! A great place for the beer connoisseur!"}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time for dinner/ dancing. Came tonight and the service was horrible. I had to go ask the hostess to get our server to greet us because we had waited 15 mins and no service. We tried the menu and its not as good as the original. Onion rings were extremely greasy and gross. The slider was good . They didn't have my raspberry mojito that I would have normally got before they changed the menu. 

The atmosphere is just very different than before the Reno. I think they are focussing more on restaurant than a pub. Sadly, I think our bier markt days on the esplanade have come to an end. 

:(:(:("}
{"text":"What a great find in Toronto!  First off...the beer selection was great...and just like most of Canada, they really take care of their beer, with proper glasses for each brand and proper temperature and carbonation.  This is definitely the place for a fun night/weekend with a lot of people and live music.  But they also have great food, although the restaurant area can be very loud during the busiest times...but after a few beers you won't care..."}
{"text":"Dear Assholes Who Run This Shitty Place:

Let me give you some tips on running a place people want to actually spend money in (which if I'm not mistaken is the point of operating a bar).

Tip #1: Allow potential paying customers to enter your premises.  Dress codes are appealing only to douche frat jocks who only feel comfortable among their swinish brethren.  Not only was I denied entrance for a stupid arbitrary reason (I was wearing a hoody), so was a friend of mine - for an equally stupid reason (his jeans had a rip in them).  Meanwhile about 17 greasy sleazeball jackasses wearing Affliction/Ed Hardy t-shirts, too much cologne and pointy alligator shoes sidled their stupid way into your place without a second glance by your bouncer.  Way to keep your place classy, guys!

Tip #2: If there's a whole group of people spending money in your place already, don't decide arbitrarily to enforce your stupid dress code to prevent one of the group members from entering your lame bar.  Because, see, when you do that, the ENTIRE GROUP LEAVES and goes RIGHT NEXT DOOR to Scotland Yard, where the bouncers are cool, the vibe is legit, the servers are friendly, the drinks are reasonably priced and people don't feel raped of their humanity just by virtue of walking inside.

Bottom line, guys: the general idea that you obviously don't understand is that when people don't spend money at your bar, your bar goes out of business.  And I'm going to recommend to everyone I know not to spend money at your bar now.  The Internet has a funny way of amplifying the testimonials of people like me.  In conclusion, suck it, Biermarkt."}
{"text":"If I'm going to the Shops at Don Mills on a Friday night I'll come here for a few reasons...

It's quite spacious and not totally packed where I have to wait 20 min+ for a table. Even when all the other restaurants were packed I could get in without a wait.

The food is good! I love that they have mussels and fries (although it many be seasonal). There aren't a lot of places in North York that have mussels and fries at a decent price. This evening I had Mushroom risotto that was really yummy aside from it being a bit oily.

Price is reasonable. It is the Shops after all but I do feel like they are not over priced for the quality of food.

The service is good! The times I have been the waitresses are very friendly and attentive to your needs. You feel like they really do care you have a good experience.

All in all I would recommend this Bier Market."}
{"text":"I loved the variety.  Wow, definitely an impressive place to go for a pint!   I got \"The Jupiler Boot\"  which was hilarious way of drinking a beer, and if you've had too much you'll get a splash on your face!"}
{"text":"Hit & miss, but mostly hit.  The place itself is awesome for grabbing a beer after work with buddies or just chilling out over a pint on a Friday or Saturday night.  Their beer selection is top notch - you name it they probably have it, including Delirium Tremens which I can't get in London.  

The food is mostly good - I had a very interesting version of mushroom soup.  I was expecting the creamy kind, but I got a clear broth with mushroom chunks in it - delicious.  The poutine I had, however, was not so hot.  I like my poutine simple (I think the curds really make the dish), and it was a little too \"fancy\" for my liking - the cheese was too salty & strong.  

Overall, I would certainly recommend this place for a relaxing meal/pint."}
{"text":"We came to bier market for a get together for y sister's bachelorette party and boys night out. 

We had dinner before and didn't intend to eat there. We have had food there before where food is okay and originally. We ordered drinks with plenty of variety to chose from. We always enjoyed the beers and cocktails. 

Some of the party guest were hungry where we ordered poutine. Unfortunately the poutine was cold and we had to return it back for another one. 

The \"third base\" beer was good. 

There was a live band playing cover music which made the night pleasant. 

We had a big crowd which we liked how accommodating the wait staff was with drinks and service. 

Overall the atmosphere was spacious, clean and different. 

Aside from the poutine ordered, bier market is always a safe bet for good time."}
{"text":"Great looking interior! However, come here for beers and that's it. Don't expect them to get cocktails right. They know how to open bottles and pour draft beer! Food is mediocre at best for what they charge. Both times food was bland and meat over cooked. Poutine is okay as well as their soups but everything else falls short. I'm giving them two stars for the interior and beer."}
{"text":"Went here for a work function. The place was nice and the server was good. My wife and I ordered the steak dinner but all that came was the steak which was good and fries (not many). No vegetables. The most annoying part of this place was one of the bouncers who loved to hear himself talk (don't think he could roll his  sleeves up any higher). He would ask people to move and then come back and ask them to move to the place they were before. He was a constant annoyance. I really don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"The Bier Markt is the perfect place to go on a hot saturday night when in Toronto.  The patio is so lively, it is close to the entertainment district, but not close enough to hear drunken girls clumsy foot steps.  Their drinks are a little pricey but delicious.  i had the sweet tart martini which was 3 0z and almost 13 dollars, but was well worth it.  They have these salads that are make it yourself, so u pick ur meat, i chose the flat iron steak, you can also choose the chicken.  and then u choose from 3 salad options.  i chose the arugula with tomatoes, manchego and onions.  My only complaint was the shavings of manchego were so minimal, and there were barely any onions.  my friend chose the steak over spinach with beets, she really liked it as well."}
{"text":"First time in Montreal!
Walked  couple blocks to the beir market. It is a modern style lik pub.
Its in a great location downtown montreal
Tried the oysters ($1 every wednesday and Thursday) they came with horse radish and some vinigrette. They were rather tiny but tasty. Had to request tabsco sauce.
Also tried the poutine! (With smoked bacon and chives) absolutely delicious. Rather small so not a great sharing item. (You wont want to share :) )   the cheese curbs were quebec style super tasty and melted all over the fries! Amazing!
This restauarent also has charcuterie style bords you can chose 3 items for 18 dollars and so on. And assortment of meat, seafood, cheese etc. Some pretty nice options.
Tried this with curry yogurt sausage, scallop civiche and smoked pork belly. Sausage was different but tasty! (2 small pieces) Pork belly (4 small pieces)was delicious .. the scallop civiche was very small and combined with yoo many peppers and cucumber to the point where it was probably only 1 single scallop cut into tiny pieces.
The restaurant has over 160 beer to chose from! Happy hour is from 5 to 8pm beer for 6 dollars,  select variety.
Th decor is red leather/wood and dark lighting. But lots of space.
Service is good.
Taxes are 15 percent in Montreal!"}
{"text":"5 stars because  this is place is way more suitable  for the location  than the queue de cheval  restaurant  that  was there  before.  I am people  after  an amazing  hockey  game  want to  relax  by sipping on some  cold  beer  and chewing  frankfurters with  it and  not  spend  2k on a dinner for 3. So,  yeah  good work... Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This place is really not what it used to be. I went here last Saturday for a friends birthday and was seriously unimpressed with every single element of the evening.

The line up was RIDICULOUS! Despite arriving at 10:00, we were still made to wait for 45 minutes. Fourty-freaking-five MINUTES!  If it hadn't been my friends birthday, there is no way I would have waited that long - it is NOT worth it and there are much better places in this city to spend your Saturday night where you will not be made to wait for eons.

Once we finally got in, we entered the massive line up for coat check. Thankfully, by this point, we were total pros at standing in  hopelessly long unmoving queues. By the time we got to the front of the line, we were informed that coat check was full, but that we could try again in 15 minutes. Wonderful.

By that point, I felt exhausted, deflated and, most of all, annoyed. Time for booze (oooo, so that's how they make their money - piss you off so badly that you NEED a drink the second they allow you to get your hands on one...well played...)!

Decided that I deserved a double with the evening I was having - when I finally made it through the sea of people across the sticky floor (movie theatres have NOTHING on this place) I was rewarded by having to pay $15 for my drink. Hooray! You better believe I switched to beer after that.

The music was DATED - if I walked into the Bier Markt last year, I swear I would have been listening to the same crap.  Even though I wasn't a fan of what they were playing, the band was pretty decent. 

The verdict for the Bier Markt? Don't do it. Do yourself a huge favour, and go ANYWHERE else."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while,  but the food is definitely not is nowhere near as good as we remembered it to be. My date and I ordered the short ribs ($30!!) and a flat bread ($10 on special). 

Not impressed at all.  I do appreciate food coming out in a timely manner, but it doesn't seem right for a full entr√©e with roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes and an 'oven-baked' flat bread to come out in less than 5 minutes! As expected, the food was less than lukewarm; the flat bread was hard as stone,  and the sides on the ribs feels like they have been sitting around the kitchen for a while. 

Definitely not worth $30 for pre-made, barely warm food."}
{"text":"I decided to give the Bier Market another try and I'm glad I did! The service today was amazing. We came for dinner and drinks and were seated right away.  Menu items were explained throughly and with great patience. Empty plates were cleared quickly and we were checked on regularly! 

My husband and brother enjoyed the wide selection of beers and I enjoyed my Swedish mojito. It was a cool and refreshing drink on a warm day like today. My husband was disappointed however, because they ran out of a beer that he had wanted to order. 

The poutine was typical, it didn't stand out. The chocolate waffle and ice cream sandwich was enjoyable - the waffle was crispy and not too sweet. The ice cream went perfectly with it. 

I'm glad I gave the Bier Market another try. It was a lovely evening. I'd come back for the drinks, as my husband likes the wide selection of beers."}
{"text":"This place is the WORST SERVICE. I came here with my coworkers having traveled from The USA. The waitress and server said we had to leave by 8PM and no other tables were available in the restaurant (it was only 7:15)...there was 8 empty tables and high tops available. So we sit at a high top and order fondue and pretzels and dinner. Good decent food and beer. The dinner comes out and 5 minutes into dinner, the stupid server comes out and says we have to leave now and shes kicking us out. I haven't even had half my food. At this point I'm pissed bc the \"VIPs\" didn't even arrive yet. And there was empty tables everywhere. Who the Heck is a VIP in Mississauga!? No one. And at 8:15, no one even came. I am certain she was lying and wanted to turn tables fast being a Saturday and more tips. N

The worst experience in the Toronto area - I don't recommend this place. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've experienced the Bier Markt a few times and let me tell you, it isn't a place to come for good beer. They have beer...a lot of it, but most is macro and pseudo-micro beer. There are some craft beers, but not many considering the vast beer menu.

My latest visit was on a Saturday night and the line up was very long and inside was packed full. This appears to be a good place to come get drunk and dance to live music, so the naming of the place escapes me."}
{"text":"Came here for some drinks with work collegues after a client meeting to celebrate the end of a project. Only ordered drinks in the middle of an afternoon so it was quiet so I can't comment on the food.

I went with a few Bier Markt Sangria drinks and they were simply fantastic. If i was here one evening and don't have to drive I'd double my drink totals easily. My only qualm is there was a little too much ice for my liking. If there was a little bit less ice and more delicious sangria this place would have gotten a solid 5 stars.

Price-tag is reasonable and the wait staff is very friendly and attentive. 

Classy joint in both decor and quality of service.

Will be back again."}
{"text":"I would really really like to give this place more than 2 stars.

The location is great and I'd love for this to be our go-to restaurant before a show - avoiding overpriced and terrible ribs served a few steps away from there. Perfect spot for after work drinks with groups or a quick eat before a hockey game - I wouldn't say it's a date-night restaurant.

Although my evening started off with a great note, perfect greeting and awesome recos for beer choices by our waiter, the rest was quite a bummer. I ordered the mussels from their vast and appealing menu, thinking this would be a sure bet. 

But the mussels were not cooked enough. Some were still fishy, too soft, and many had not had time to open. I also believe that the loads of garlic and onions that were thrown in there were raw. Raw garlic and onions, really? Basically, the entire thing just wasn't cooked! 

Moreover, service quickly became overwhelmed and disorganized, and we just lost our server...

I will say I appreciated that they did not charge me for the mussels I did not eat, and the rest of the dishes looked delish - burgers, salads, poutines... So I will probably be giving this place a second chance, but I definitely won't be ordering mussels !!"}
{"text":"I visited this location for a friend's birthday party over the weekend. I am not a fan of beer, and I've only been to the Bier Markt downtown location once years ago, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect here.

The decor was cozy and rustic, I actually liked it quite a bit. It felt like you were downtown even though you're really in the parking lot of Square One (lol). Surprisingly, this place was packed at 6pm and didn't die down.

It really reminded me menu-wise of the Mill Street Brewery downtown. The menu seemed almost the same! It took me a long time to decide what to order...not because there were so many options, but quite the opposite. Not too much appealed to me since a lot of the apps were share plates and most of the mains were in around $25. I finally settled on the Veal, which came with asparagus and mashed potatoes. There were 2 pieces of veal, one was stringy and chewy like shoe leather but the other piece was delicious. I guess that's the risk you take with veal...sometimes it's tough. 

The pricey menu will probably eliminate this place as a regular on my list of spots to go for dinner, but as a once in awhile treat it is nice. Certainly a fan of Beer would have a lot more to be excited about here."}
{"text":"The white wines here are terrible! If you're a wine drinker you're better off expanding your horizons and drinking beer. I got the Stiegel Radler, which basically taste like a bubbly grapefruit juice with a splash of white beer. It's only 2.5% alcohol and 12 oz. glass. It's a very good entry point for those who don't like beer. I'm definitely selling this better than the server who tried to make me get a 20 oz. glass of something else. No thanks!

The chicken and Brie flatbread is quite mediocre. I'd try something else next time. 

Service was pretty good this time around considering how busy it was. I've been before and service was abysmally slow. 

There's live entertainment on stage. The music is ok. A bunch of hip old guys in suits and ties (even bowties) singing and playing instruments. 

I've been here twice before. Full dinner on a less busy night was great. Drinks and apps in the bar area on a busy night is  decent. 

Bier Markt is a fun night out.. Kinda. Remember, don't get the wine! I never used to drink whites and it's because of places like this that serve terrible, possibly old, white wine."}
{"text":"I'm not here to defend any of the poor reviews that have been posted before me. I am also not the biggest fan of the inebriated mosh pit of corporate partiers/stagettes/19th birthday weekends - not that there's anything wrong with it. Coming here for lunch on one of the most gorgeous days we've had so far though, makes me wish that everyone who only vaguely remembers EBM through a drunken haze for its sweat mixed with spilled beer and ear achingly loud live-band fueled nights that the food is worth a lunch or dinner return trip.

Pretty much everything on the Euro-inspired menu is prepared with creativity and care in-house. This weekend, peanut butter doggie biscuits were even created especially for Woofstock! I've tried almost everything on the menu and here are some suggestions: The petite mussels (fancy-pantsily called \"moules\" on the menu) are best Congo($13/half kilo), a spicy Thai-curry and leek broth. Even the rosemary and thyme flecked side of bread is served hot and fresh out of the oven with a side of nutmeg butter. Roasted beet salad with perfectly grilled salmon ($13), topped with goat cheese, candied walnuts, and baby spinach is not only pleasing to look at, but a complicated and delightful combination of flavours. On Tuesdays, the white veal and mushroom meatloaf ($19) weekly special is out of this world.

My advice is to skip the weekend action unless you're there for an obligatory birthday (when you'll have fun no matter where you are) or are lucky enough to have been invited for a corporate-paid wine and cheese. 

Don't get mad cuz they wouldn't let you and your fabulous sneaker-clad self in, the mega line up that's wrapping around the block will more than make up for their loss of your business and you won't be missed. As much as this is not a place for some people, it is the go-to den of debauchery for many, many others. And why not? To each their own! I say, come try your luck for a seat on the sunny patio and enjoy some fancy cookin' to properly compliment your $9 brew instead."}
{"text":"Why in the world would someone like me, who doesn't like beer, go to Bier Markt?

Because my friends wanted to meet there for brunch!

It was too cool for the patio, so sadly we dined inside.  Being half a flight down (so not accessible by wheelchair) it was very dark inside on such a sunny day.

There is a giant menu of beers (Biers) and being a Saturday, we were given a lunch menu and a brunch menu.

All of us went for brunch items.

The food was okay but nothing outstanding, the best part was the frites someone ordered for the table because they wanted home fries with their eggs, sausage and french toast.

The ATM in the hall to the washrooms was oddly placed.

I think I need to do another review after visiting on a day when we can sit on the patio.

Servers were friendly."}
{"text":"The beer is kind of whatever, and typical of pretty much all bars of this sort.  Acceptable but nothing special.

The food was above average with pretty good spins on American classics. The \"steak\" cut calamari was just grilled without breading, served cold with a drizzle of lemon on a lettuce leafs. It was a simple but effective prep, perfect with the poutine. 

The wings were good.  Drummed sticks trimmed to lollipops then served with buffalo sauce (and something else that tasted sweeter).  Perfectly fried and the buffalo sauce was spot on.  A lot healthier too because wings weren't drenched in the sauce.

Crunchy Brussels sprout leaves worked well. A little greasy but that ended up working really well with the citrus on the calamari."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time for dinner a few weeks after their grand opening. The place itself and ambiance is fantastic.

Amazing beer selection. They have so many to offer, you can't be disappointed. 

Down side for me was the food. We ordered the Merchant Kobe burger and the Chicken Flammekueche. To make the story short, in both dishes I found hard pieces within the meat, which I couldn't identify, probably cartilage. I'm not being pretentious, but the hard pieces found in the burger were literally pebbles. 

We then spoke with the manager and he offered us a second Kobe burger, but we refused. Unfortunately, I had already lost my appetite. He offered us two desserts. He also mentioned he didn't have any quality control over the meat. Not cool.

At least, desserts were good.

For what we were paying, the quality of the meat wasn't worth it. I understand they're new to the markt!, but they definitely need to change up a few things."}
{"text":"we had a very similar experience to Lynn C.  We just went tonight for a birthday party of 20 people. First off, they have a specific rule that you can not bring a cake into the restaurant. IF you want a cake you have to buy it from them, and a regular 12 inch cake is $80.

They divided the bill into 2 tables, which appears to be more than they did for Lynn, however when they did that, we were told whenever we wanted to pay they could charge us individually.

I will say though overpriced, the food was excellent, but when it came time for a couple of the couples to leave early, they refused to let us pay with credit card. They said that if we wanted to leave we had to close out the entire bill. We told them we could inform them exactly what to charge us for on a new separate bill, then just delete our order from the other bill but again they refused. The waitress was rude and the manager was a tool.

They lost a ton of business tonight. If they had have let the 2 couples who needed to leave pay separately, the tab would have remained open, and they would have continued to make sales. Instead, they closed out the bill, forcing everyone to do the math and figure out how much they owed then on the spot, and putting a halt to the entire evening.

VERY poor managerial skills.

They made what would have been a 5 star review a 1 star review"}
{"text":"Ugh, should have listened to the other reviews and avoided this place. Instead hubby and I decided to stay on the patio. I had the chacuterie board (dried out cheese that had been cut earlier and fatty pieces of meat). Hubby had the fish & chips which were very good and a side order of gravy (thick layer on the top and strange spice flavour) which was not so good. One of my beers came with a huge hair floating in it, which I pointed out as soon as he put it down. Recieved a small apology and brought a new one. 

When the bill arrived, it still had the hair beer on it & the gravy which we sent back. A good server or proper restaurant would have fixed the bill and possibly comp'ed a drink for the hair sutuation. Needless to say, listen to the reviews here and skip this place. Wvrst down the street is substanially better."}
{"text":"Fabulous food! My colleague and I brought two guests from Germany and Sweden for lunch. We were pressed for time and asked whether we could get our orders rushed. They were!

The good was delicious. I had the markt burger with chicken and spatzel soup. Devine! They all taste homemade. I washed it down with Goose Beer from Collingwood. 

I'm coming back to sample more beer and food."}
{"text":"Underrated.  The food was excellent...we had the grilled chicken burger, calamari, double burger, breakfast benny burger and really good fries.  I had the August special Kensington Watermelon beer...very refreshing with just a hint of Watermelon!  Service was middle of the road."}
{"text":"My first time here, and I will NEVER return...
We came as a large party to celebrate my BFF's birthday as per her request, but I left very upset, as the service was HORRIBLE! I'm normally very understanding & patient (Trust me, I work in fast-food, I know what bad customers are like, so I know how not to act towards servers!) but this place really pushed me to the edge, enough to get on Yelp to write a ranting review 

1. My food was taking forever to arrive...About 45 mins after we had ordered & the rest of our table was almost all finished, I flagged our waitress down and asked where my food was. She went to check, and returned with, \"They had a problem with the fish the 1st time around, so they're making another one.\" Okay, why couldn't I have been told about this without having to ask you? Also, I'd ordered an appetizer which still hadn't arrived in that 45 minutes, so did they make THAT one wrong too?? The whole table stayed later because they had to first wait for my food to arrive, then for me to finish it.

2. My boyfriend & best friend both ordered upgraded candied bacon poutines with their orders. When their food came, both got regular poutine. When they asked for it to be changed, the male/possibly head manager was very nice, and said \"Sure, no problem!\" HOWEVER, it never came, and we had to ask for it again. When it DID come, waaay later, they only brought one, not two. At this point, we figured there was no point in asking for the 2nd bacon poutine, since the 1st one took so long.

3. The waitress was...good grief. She was nice, yes, but not very competent, unfortunately. She even joked about it, \"I'm not very good at multi-tasking!\" but I couldn't even laugh, because I was too busy agreeing & rolling my eyes in my mind. When our separate bills came, HALF the table found problems with their bills. Either they were being charged for other people's food, or they were charged for tip twice, or there was an extra gift/service charge, on TOP of the auto-tip. 

4. My boyfriend had snuck in a cake to surprise my best friend with, being her birthday and all. This waitress, walks up to my best friend, of all people, and says loudly, \"When would you like us to bring out the birthday cake??\" When it became obvious that SHE was the \"unaware-of-cake-birthday girl,\" this waitress doesn't say a word, instantly turns around and leaves our table. Great job RUINING the surprise! And not even having the decency to try to cover it up, or at least apologize?!

5. Trying to get my food was another quest in itself  I asked her for a box, she said \"Okay\" & never returned. After waiting too long, as our party had already stayed much longer than expected, everybody left & I was still waiting for my box. I asked the male/head manager, and after saying \"Sure!\", he ALSO never returned with my box. I ended up getting a box from someone else. They weren't even jam-packed, so I don't know what was so hard as getting me my box.

The food was decent, but I really was too frustrated and upset to enjoy it, so that pretty much ruined my whole dining experience 
Just writing this made me peeved all over again! Do not come here! If anything, try another Bier Markt location, NOT this one, unless you enjoy horrible/lacking service"}
{"text":"To begin with ambience is good. Our server Tim was phenomenal his recommendations for beer were spot on. Ordered 8oz steak, with a side of green salad and quinoa.   Steak was done to perfection and loved salad as well. I am going back again this week to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on a Thursday evening.  We were greeted and seated right away.  The place was quite empty.  The food selection wasn't all that exciting.  Both myself and my companion ordered a burger.  After 25 minutes of waiting, the table next to us received their order.  After handling the burgers, they called the waiter over and notified the waiter that it wasn't their order.  The waiter took the burgers and delivered them to our table.  I then advised the waiter that the customers that had received the burgers in the first place had put their hands all over the burgers and ate some of the fries off the plates already.  He then asked me which burger was manhandled, I said I'm not sure it was both I was only looking at one of the guest so he took back my burger and brought my order back 5 minutes later so they obviously they did not create a new order.  Needless to say, I could not eat.  I will not return.  Not only is the food overpriced but they obviously don't have hygiene in mind when handling food."}
{"text":"Had a large group and it took a long time for them to get organized. They were nice once they got into the groove. However, I went there after a long sweating sports game and was not expecting a dating place. 

This is a place to take a date and show off your bling, the beer is good but the price is a little higher than what I would expect from a place like this."}
{"text":"They have amazing booze and friendly service but the food isn't great at all. I came here on a Friday night with my husband and a good friend from San Francisco, having high expectations. The Markt Charcuterie was nicely presented but I wished there were more cold cuts and cheese. Next, my Atlantic salmon was burnt on one side and soggy on the other and the quinoa cakes weren't crispy and lathered with grease. I would have been happier just with Markt frites and pretzels and a couple of mojitos and flavored beer. We tried one last time for Bier Markt to redeem itself by ordering dessert, but the Belgian waffles only added more to our disappointment. The server forgot to give us the chocolate sauce and when we requested and got it, we realized we shouldn't have bothered. It was not even real chocolate, more like ready-to-eat chocolate pudding! The waffles were also flimsy and tasteless. Drinks are great, but I wish they could improve on the food.. Or maybe they do better on schnitzels and burgers. I know it's unfair to write a review based on just one visit. I would consider visiting again, or perhaps try a different Bier Markt location."}
{"text":"They have a nice big location downtown with lots of room inside. The decor and ambience inside is casual. 1$ oysters were great!  They were very fresh and were a nice size (Ask for their special Lingonberry hot sauce to go with them!). Our waiter was super pleasant and on point with service/suggestions. However, my main course was just okay , I had a grilled chicken burger with house salad. The portion was perfect since it wasn't too much food but enough to be filling. However, quality wise the salad was alright , it was fresh but very basic and the chicken burger was lacking flavor and was on the cusp of undercooked. For the price I expected a little better to be honest. Overall , I would come back for the oysters and for some beer but may choose another option for food as the dish I chose wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"I was there on a long weekend Saturday night (May17th) with a few friends and we really enjoyed our visit here. We started the night on the patio where we had a couple of speciality beers and some wings (which were the best wings I have had in a long time) Our hostess was great, she got us a nice table on the patio and our server was very good too, friendly and fast. After we went inside into the main bar (the entertainment switches back in forth between a DJ and a live band).
The patio was great for people watching the crowd is a mix of 20 somethings to people in their 50's.  Overall I found the prices very reasonable for downtown, the staff very good and the crowd was nice too. This is a great place to spend an evening with a date or some good friends. Start out on the patio and finish your night off in the main bar, No complaints at all ;o)"}
{"text":"Often when a bar expands, its very rare that they can replicate the original and this so true when it comes to this location. Although brand new, it lacks the atmosphere and vibe of the Bier Markt on the Esplanade. This place is a little awkward to get to by public transportation. 
And if you are driving here  be very careful because its in area notorious for 'RIDE' spotchecks. I woulld suggest coming here if you have been shopping at Sherway Gardens or happen to be the neighborhood, but would not come here again as for a stand alone visit.
If you truly have your heart set on the Biere Markt, hit up the Esplanade location instead.
I have been to this location twice, and it has always been very busy. And guys, if you are looking to meet a girl or two here, its mostly a male 25 to 40 crowd. Nice place to have a quick drink or snack."}
{"text":"Great food, lots of interesting beers to choose from, great entertainment (sporting events are usually followed by a live band on weekends) and friendly waiters and waitresses. I have been here several times and have never had a bad experience. If you live downtown you can get to this location very easily by walking, cab or TTC. The crowd is casual and mixed. My only complaint is that later in the evening it gets very crowded. The best times to go on Saturdays are between 7pm and 10pm. The live bands are usually very good too! It consistently draws a relatively friendly casual crowd. Try the beer 'sampler tray' if you go!"}
{"text":"Best beer selection in Montreal! 150 beers from 30 countries around the world. What's not to like!

Had a great beer flight called Je Me Souviens. I think I made a mistake by ordering their appetizers,  which were not great, instead of their charcuterie. Oh well, Happy New Year!"}
{"text":"Bier Markt.

I find myself here far more often than I would like thanks to friends that like sticking within their regular routine hang outs. Beer is good and the beer is good but that's about it. Decor is okay, it looks like they tried to make a pub fancier than it should and that, my friends, is the wrong way to do a bier centric pub. Even the food looks very frou-frou. White table cloths and small plates. Portions are dismal considering the prices you are paying.

Waitstaff and bar staff are pretty bad too. Either rude and don't want to give you the time of day, too flustered with how busy the place is, unfriendly, know nothing about the beer, or all of these traits rolled into one! Knowing nothing about beer should not be acceptable in a place called Bier Markt! Come on guys, you could do better.

Luckily I know a few world beers and the beer selection here is great. Prices are decent especially since you can't get these beers on draight anywhere else. 

Overall, drink lots because you're gonna need it to have a good time and to ignore the poor quality staff, food, and decor. At least the beer is good though. Actually it's fucking delicious."}
{"text":"Last night was packed. They have a live cover band. Great beer selection of beers on tap. It was a pretty good time"}
{"text":"Really big selection of beers. Service wasn't the best. We ordered our drinks and food together. Food came 10 minutes prior to getting our drinks. Service can definitely improve."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night with a girlfriend of mine. The restaurant is smaller than the rest. Was quickly seated at a high table for 2. Tough because there was no where to really put all of our bags and jackets, so we kind of had to sit with it on our laps. Besides that overall, an okay experience. The night we came they were handing out free samples of Blanche de Chambly which was a definite bonus!

Food- amazing. Great quality like the rest of the other locations. Ordered their calamari, cheese sticks (MUST TRY!) and a side order of a poutine. All of them amazing!! 

Drinks - MUST try le trappe...always a go to. If we had more time to sit down, i would definately recommend the sweet and sour beer tour. But you must try le trappe. No questions, its a great beer. Smooth, yet fruity, and strong. Great trappist beer!"}
{"text":"Only go here for Le Trappe. Food is a little bit pricey for what you get. But if you're coming here, come here to taste the beers. Especially Le Trappe. The fondue is just \"okay\". Had better. Wouldn't recommend to eat here as it's more a beer place than a foodie place."}
{"text":"Went with my girl to this location because I knew the shopps on don mills location was good. Got the usual Le Trappe but then decided to order the beer samplers. We ordered one and decided to share,
Except it was kind of a turn off that we found a hefty size of hair embedded in the foam of one cup. Asked for a new one but the service was awfully slow. Went here during lunch hour during the week and expected the waitresses to host well as the patio was quite busy. Took almost 30-40 mins to find our actual waitress. When asked the hostess sitting down for our bill, she just said \"I'm the hostess\" and didn't even offer to get our waitress. Service needs a little bit of help. But besides that, I would recommend the don mills location over this one any day. Only nice thing is the patio."}
{"text":"I have honestly never had any desire to try this place.  But today was so damn cold!  After a couple hours of shopping along Queen, we dropped south to find a pub in search of a pint and some comfort food.  This was the closest, so we settled.  I wish we hadn't.

It was around 3 pm and the place wasn't busy; our server came over promptly and took our drink order.  Looking good.  But not so, for they arrived an eternity later.  We ordered the mini burgers and the wings to share.  The food also took a decade to show.  The burgers were okay I guess, but the wings were a big disappointment.  Eight measly wings for $15.  The homemade sauce just tasted like Franks Red Hot which I like but it's mighty unhomemade.  And the wings had a sprinkling of black sesame seeds on them which had a bitter flavour.  

And getting the bill, let's just say it was a Christmas miracle.  Our server was in absentia so long I thought we'd have to wait until 2014. When she finally did come, I guess the best you can say for this experience was she was relatively pleasant."}
{"text":"If long lines do not scare you, dare trying Bier Markt. Once you are allowed to assume your position at the table it's time to relax, have some exotic beer with rather nice pub food. 
Beers: Great selection, definitely go for something you won't see anywhere else in Canada. Last time I had French XO which was quite flavorful.  

Food: Slightly above average. Beet salad is quite fresh and it's a very generous portion. Mussels are A-OK, definitely had better ones with more intense stocks, but will do since you can share them. Wurst board wasn't impressive at all, to me white sandwich bread which houses the wursts is a crazy overkill.

Atmosphere: Loud, chatting, somewhat uptight, the size of the tables is uncomfortably small which causes you to sit in a gargouille position out of fear of brushing elbows with your neighbors. These things will stop bothering you after the 3rd glass, so just either drink fast or come prepared."}
{"text":"i came here a couple weeks ago to grab drinks with some girlfriends. i have been to the sherway bier markt and didn't like it so i didn't have high hopes for this location either.
BUT

It was great! our server was very nice and recommended what drinks to go with since i have a no beer resolution for 2014. the only thing is their menu is kind of pricey and doesn't have much selection. i opted for the short rib poutine and loved it! its a good portion to fill satisfy you while having some drinks. they had a few different kinds too!

i also had the creme brulee it was a huge portion AND came with 2 french macroons on the side. so delicious and decadent

it was a friday night so there was a dj playing top 40 songs and some rnb. it was a good atmosphere overall. I will be back!"}

{"text":"When it opened in 2010 the Bier market was great. Now it has spiralled down to a level like Jack Astros, which isn't so bad but took everything off the menu we liked.
The BM had a really tough steak and overcooked fries .
For New Years the fare was limited and had a nice ambience , but the cement floors and the noisy area didn't add to a enjoyable New Year's Eve."}
{"text":"150 beers, many on tap. Clean, trendy and generally very busy. Service is good but food is hit or miss. On one occasion I had the raw oysters which were fresh and delicious, accompanied by 3 nice sauces. I also has the PEI mussels Proven√ßal with pommes frites and they were nicely steamed and aromatic. Nice dinner. Another time I had the veal schnitzel and it was barely edible. Overall I enjoy this restaurant and will try other fare. Just so you know their charcuterie board and fondue look amazing. I'll try that next time."}
{"text":"From the other reviews it sounds like the Bier Markt (once known to me as the Miet Markt) is still going strong on the Friday and Saturday nights with live music, great beer selection and a party hardy attitude.  And yes, a few years ago that was me and my friends shivering in line on the sidewalk as we dutifully waited to get inside.

Flash forward to now and I enjoy the Bier Markt for its beer savvy wait staff, beer menu, pleasant ambiance in the front dining area, and reliable food.  The menu names are a bit gimmicky with the umlauts and Frenglish -- it feels like shopping at the Belgium food equivalent of Ikea and the prices are just a tiny bit on the high side considering many of the dishes are quite simple and do-able at home.  

Tonight I had the beet salad with goat cheese, candied walnuts, spinach, panko-crusted soft boiled egg and topped with a flat-iron steak for $18 - see what I mean, I should've gone for something fancier like my husband who had the prawns and scallop on risotto cake ($29) and the Markt Poutine which features shredded smoked chicken ($12) both really flavourful and I wanted more than the forkful I got to taste.  My sister-in-law enjoyed her sea bass and father-in-law was very happy with the filet-burger.

They didn't have my first choice of beer available so our server suggested the Leffe Blonde which went really well with the Wurst Sampler app ($17 for six tasty stubby smoky sausages, some gerkins and olives and a wedge of smoky cheese) but for some reason, even though it was in the list of recommended beers for my salad, it started to taste skunky.  Maybe it was the beets or the dressing that started clashing with the beer.  Maybe I should have said something to the server.  Dessert was off the seasonal menu and were apple fritters - little timbit sized delights freshly deep fried and tossed in cinnamon and sugar ($8).

This entire review is timely considering last night (Saturday) I was hanging out at home reading the recent Yelp \"you know you're old when\" talk thread and here I am talking about going to the Bier Markt to eat (ha!) on a Sunday (haha!)."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. 

The clientele is much better than the Bier Markt Esplanade location - older/more mature crowd, but there were still a fair share of douchebags nonetheless. We had to beat some Irish lads away sticks as they would not piss off. Sigh.

The interior also wasn't anywhere nearly as crowded/packed and you could actually get at the bar and order drinks quickly. There was a live band playing some horrible 1990s grunge covers (good songs, bad covers) but it was entertaining to say the least.

Didn't get to try any food as we arrived late. Can't comment. Very large selection of beers if that's your thing."}
{"text":"I just don't like it here. It could be partially the douchey clientele, so if you like douches then please don't let my review discourage you from visiting here.

The food here is touted as gastropub fare but I really find it quite overpriced. It is decent..but $16 for 3 sliders seems a bit exorbitant to me. 

They do have a decent patio and it's a bit of fun during the day. Evening the hordes arrive and it's mostly a younger meat markety type crowd, nothing unusual for the Esplanade.

Of course, there is an amazing selection of beers."}
{"text":"After our tragic experience at Cheesewerks, we wandered aimlessly looking for cheese. Luckily I remembered that Bier Markt does a fondue and thus must have cheese!

AND CHEESE THEY HAD!

We had the baked brie with loganberries and the pick 3 things cheese plate - we picked smoked gouda, emmental, and candied bacon (OMG THAT BACON). All of it was delicious and reasonably priced! And everything the menu said would be on the boards, was indeed on our boards! Huzzah for having our expectations met! And the extra super plus of Bier Markt is the exceptional beer selection (duh).

Our waitress was super nice! A manager-type looking dude came and asked us if we were doing ok. It was a pleasant change from our prior attempt at dinner.

Only negative is it's VERY loud. But I'm in old lady mode these days! So whateves!

Also the table next to us was: young boyfriend meets girlfriend's family. So THAT was great!"}
{"text":"No coat hooks, junior staff, no kids meal options, no apple juice, good selection of beer but food very average !"}
{"text":"Went to this Bier Markt for the first time for a gathering of friends. Many people said it wasn't as good as the downtown one (which I have been too)

But honestly, it was amazing. The waitress was prompt with our table, the food was delicious, the alcohol was so good I can't remember (jks). They had live music on this Saturday night.

Definite recommend."}
{"text":"3.5 stars 
The beer selection is very extensive (best in the city?) but also a good bit more expensive than they should be. I can get quite a few of my favourites that are available at various bars around the city (e.g. Delirium at Ronnie's) also at Bier Market, but it will cost more for the same! 

The food is also rather pricey for the items presented! The wurst sampler is both the best deal and choice from the menu from what I have tried.

The cover bands on the weekends are pretty decent, and you'll get a good bunch of suds aficionado dancing in front of the stage as the night wears on. Das Boot is also available on Monday nights now, so there is some good news for people who want to drink out of hard to wash glassware in the name of authenticity! 

There is often a line formed outside Biermarkt sometimes regardless of how crowded it is inside, but the line is definitely not as bad as that of the Esplanade Bier Markt and moves reasonably quickly."}
{"text":"Bier Markt on the Esplanade is a great restaurant for a guy who thinks he's ballin' to take a girl who doesn't know better. I can see how the facade might impress some, but let me break it down for you:

The beer list is great. Mammoth. I don't drink beer that much so I'll let the other reviewers speak to this, but I'm thinking if you love beer, this might be a good place to drink... at least for a few post-work pints. 

The food is decent-ish, but the price is whack. Way too expensive for what you get. 

We did Summerlicious here, so for a $35 3 course meal, I was more than happy, but I wouldn't have been if I'd paid regular price. 

I got the T-Bone Burger, house salad, and lemon tart. Burger was good, the fries were yummy, but you can get better for cheaper. House salad was a house salad. Lemon tart was bangin'! 

I agree with most of the other reviewers regarding the crowd. It wasn't an unpleasant experience, but not really my scene. And I was there on a Thursday eve... I can imagine how it goes into super-douche mode on weekends. 

Our server was really nice/attentive, the manager stopped by to see how things were, and they were accomodating when we were a little late due to stupid Jays traffic and an absence of available cabs. They did, however, remind me 37 times that we only had the table 'til 7:30 (our reso was at 5:30)."}

{"text":"I've been here a number of times for after work drinks, dinner, and whatever you call it at night on weekends.  Its usually packed with long lineups when in \"nightlife\" mode.  That's when I least like the place, but nonetheless they do have a good selection of beers.  The food is alright but nothing special.  They do have a game menu (I think its yearly) that is worth checking out but a little bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"First time at Bier Market, the one across Sherway Gardens, its an easy location to go to especially if your at the mall and want a cool, down to earth vibe. Came here for a friends birthday an hour ago, We reversed seats for 7 people and got a nice long table, wasn't really busy busy for a Friday night, our food and drinks came out with great timing. Maybe a little slow at first since everyone was just getting drinks.

Huge selection of beers, I don't drink, but I know a lot of people who do, so coming here for a beer and trying all different types of beer would definitely be a heaven to some people. 

3 out of 7 ordered the Fish & Chips, Its the Belgian blonde fish and Frits If I remember correctly, that was delicious. It was actually really really crispy on the outside so that crunch will happen after every bite. The fries were well down which was really tasty. 

Our waitress was fun and really made us feel comfortable. We started singing happy birthday and the whole place was singing along too! which was pretty dope everyone had a great time, and will definitely come back again.

One awesome thing was the scene card points, if you were the first person to show your scene card, you would get the points from the whole table."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to see the Raptors
game at the ACC and we parked at the Esplanade area. There's a bunch of restaurants along this area. In the summertime this area is a great place with lots of patio options.  We decided to go to The Bier Marker because their menu looked interesting. The place was packed with a lot of people since it's Saturday and also maybe some of the people came from the Raptors game like us.  We got seated right away and the service was great. Our waitress was very polite and attentive.  I felt so bad for her when her when the 2 beers on her tray came crash down and spilled beer all over the couple next to us.  
My boyfriend ordered one of their specialty beer which he really liked and I ordered a glass of pino grigio.  Usually we have our calamari.  They have the pretzel calamari on the menu which we thought was interested but then we decided to go with the drunken duck wings which was duck drumsticks marinated in bier.  It was ok.  A little bland and not too flavourful.  For our mains I got the coconut curry mussels and substituted frites for beer batter onion ring.  The curry was not that flavourful and tasted a bit bitter.  Its a good thing I got the small.  The onion rings was essentially the same batter as the fish and chip. It was very greasy I did not enjoy it and only had one of the rings.  My boyfriend ordered a burger with sweet potato fries. The potato fries tasted a bit fishy.  We think they fried the potato fries with the onion rings at the same time as the fish and chip.  The couple next to us had fish and chip.  Also the portion was so small.  The burger was also bland nothing special.  All in all I would probably not come back but glad I tried this place."}
{"text":"great place to hang out and chill with friends. i've been to one of the toronto locations before (the one near union) so i was really excited when i heard there's a mississauga location as well. this one feels more like a bar/restaurant than the other one, which (to me) felt more like a bar/club. i came here on a tuesday night with a group of friends - there was 6 of us, but luckily we were able to be seated right away. the beer samplers are great. i tried the fruity one which 5/6 of them were awesome! some of the fruity beers taste like juice... but anyway, the samplers are a good way to try a bunch of items then buy a pint/pitcher afterwards of the one(s) you like. easy to find parking and the location was easy to find. if you don't drive (or don't want to) it's a relatively easy walk from the bus terminal or the mall."}
{"text":"The beer selection is great, but pricey. The food is overpriced. We ordered the Gouda bombs and for $12, I expect more than 5 deep fried pieces of cheese."}
{"text":"Excellent choix de bi√®res, bel endroit. √âvitez le burger de thon ahi, boulette de thon hach√© trop cuite et les frites n'√©taient pas fra√Æches. Les menus n'√©taient qu'en anglais.

Bon endroit pour prendre un verre, un peu moins pour manger..."}
{"text":"Have been to this location numerous times, I  can say that it's good for what it's good for - a great place to grab a drink and hang out with friends. 

FOOD: The dishes I've tried here (e.g. the Merchant Burger, Veal Schnitzel, Markt Wings) don't warrant a visit in itself, and are actually a bit on the pricey side ($25 for each of the burger/veal). I do recommend the flight of poutines however. This \"Trio\" allows you to try  all 3 of the pastrami, porter bacon, and short-rib poutines for $20. 

BEER: As per its namesake, this is a great place to try custom-brewed beers that you may not be able to find elsewhere. The beer menu is quite extensive (complete with country of origin and descriptions), so there's always something new to try from upon repeated visits. The flight of samplers is a good way to go if you're looking for variety, or to share with friends.

SUMMARY: Eat if you're hungry, but stay for the drinks and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a drink and a bite on a weekday evening. I'd imagine it gets quite crowded on the weekend though. Although I've been increasingly unimpressed with other Bier Markt locations, this Mississauga location has not disappointed yet.

Obviously this place is best know for its wide selection of beers, and boy do they have a lot! If you are a beer connoisseur, you'll likely be quite content with a lengthy book (yup, book) of international brews. If you're a simple and lazy drinker, as I am, the sampler is good way to go.

After previously trying chicken-in-a-can and the veal, my go-to meal here is the Markt burger. It's usually nice and juicy, with the option to add topics as desired. Last time I went, the kitchen had overcooked our patties, but they were more than willing to re-do them, which was appreciated. 

I wish I recalled the name of our last server here, because she was super welcoming and attentive. I suppose in general, the service here is pretty strong. This resto has a spacious interior and swanky bar area, and a roomy patio out front that opens up in the summer time. 

Now that patio season is here, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here the other day after volleyball, looking to tame the hunger beast with lots of heavy greasy food. 

I went with the summer special, which was a \"Double Burger\" (sauteed onions, mayo, bacon on two patties). The bun was fairly standard - I'm not usually too particular with this as long as it isn't soggy, and if the patty is juicy, which it was. The accompanying fries were crispy, the way I like them. Also went with the \"Crab Dip,\" which was pretty nice in texture and taste (you could taste the crab and cheesiness), but I was not a fan of the pita bread they used - it seemed too crusty and stale when compared to other dipping breads I've had at other restos.

The group I was with was getting pretty hangry, because the service here was sloooow. Rating would have been higher based on the food alone. If you don't mind the long wait times though, this place has as good of a patio as you will find in this area. The interior part of the restaurant seemed a bit dank though, and had a different vibe than the other Bier Markt's.

I would come back for the burger and patio, but only if I wasn't so hungry that I couldn't put up with the sluggish service."}
{"text":"If you can't accommodate a reservation for 20 people, you shouldn't be charging at $42 minimum per person.

Our service was slow and haphazard. Two appetizers for two people came first, then another two for the other table, then all the rest of the appetizers came together with the entrees. Needless to say, there was no room on the table to eat and you were overwhelmed with all the cold food in front of you.

Things I ate/tried:
-brie and lobster fondue: there was no lobster, just seafood flavour
-chicken wings: nice presentation, fairly mccain's tasting
-wurst sampler: pretzels too salty, no salt on the wursts
-steak frite: steak was jerky and flavourless and cold COLD COLD
-tuna steak: no flavour, also cold cold COLD

Of course, they can't accomodate 20 separate bills, but can you imagine 20 people's order worth of drinks and food? The bill was gigantically long and we were short $100...of course there was no way to disentangle who paid short and if there was a mistake on the bill. 

I paid $70 for the steak and half a wurst sampler and a coffee...yup. 

I'm never going back, ever.

GO TO JOEY'S NEXT DOOR."}
{"text":"It was originally a \"1\", but deservedly upgraded to a \"3\".  I would go back, and their effort gets an A+.  but ... there's a story here ... so read on if you so wish as my reviews can occasionally ramble on and on and on and on :D.  


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


First let me say that I am a big fan and regular at the King west location, and occasional patron of the Esplanade.  Friends organized a birthday dinner, and selected this new Sherway location as the venue.  

This place has just recently opened, so I cut them a very slight bit of slack to iron out the kinks and get this restaurant running smoothly. 

Our experience started out with a reservation 3 weeks in advance (for 10ppl).  32 hours prior to our start time last night, we call in to update that we have an extra person joining us.  They say \"no\".  Their reasoning on the phone was that they were fully booked, and that they'd already tacked chairs onto a table for 8 for our group of 10.  Shocked, we ask and what if that meant we'd cancel the entire reservation?  The girl goes to (presumably) speak with a manager and returns to the phone to say \"no\".  

I was so stunned by this that I promptly wrote up a YELP review --- to my happy surprise, the 1st review for the restaurant :).  I then proceeded to paste a link to my review on the Bier Markt facebook wall (which was 'managed' so wasn't displayed to the public).  I suggested to them that it wasn't too late to fix this problem, and that was all.  I was prepared to not go (as I was the 11th person), but had a glimmer of hope that they would see it and fix it.  And they did!

I commend Bier Markt (and/or their social media content manager) for first off seeing the post, and much more so for replying to it WITH A SOLUTION.  They ended up giving  us a table to accommodate the party - the \"chef's table\" which was a beautiful solid oak wooden table in a semi-private knook adjacent to the bar area.  Good job for fixing the less than hospitable reservation experience, despite having to resort to my super-human, Elite powers in the Yelp community to urge this ;)

The hostesses were absolutely lovely upon entering.  Warm and friendly and brought us to our table with a smile.  Our petite vixen of a waitress was just as charming and attentive.  

Having put myself through school and traveled the world as a waiter and bartender, I have great respect and admiration for good service and the hospitality industry in general ... but I can also be very discerning and critical.  

The beers were all of course great, although they didn't have one I'd requested in stock.  The food was very good, and at those price points what I would demand.  My bit of feedback (as I know the good folks of the Bier Markt are checking back for this review) is regarding 'running' the food.  Not a single runner (whether for beers, tea or the food) had a clue who ordered what.  For a $20-50 entrees while drinking $6-20 gourmet beers, I expect the runners and/or server to direct exactly the right dish to the right person without disrupting our conversation or making us try to figure out if that is the pork schnitzel or veal schnitzel.  The biggest problem on the running was that 2 guests had ordered the black angus burger.  One rare and one medium-well.  They weren't marked with a coloured toothpick or anything, and the runners didn't even know how each was cooked.  We had to cut into them to guess.  Turned out they were both well, which was close enough for one easy going and hungry soul.  But Dave the blood thirsty burger eater had to wait 10 minutes into our meals to get his rare burger remade.  I get it - mistakes can happen ... but when you're automatically adding a gratuity onto the bill, and charging the prices they do ... I expect more than these kinds of rookie hospitality industry gaffs.  

So in summary - I am not writing this detail to slam the Bier Markt at all ... I'm writing it to encourage them to give the excellent level of service that I've come to enjoy at the King street location.

A+ for turning the experience around from an almost tragic blunder ... I hope you can instill this sense of hospitality management and customer service into each and every one of your staff."}
{"text":"Day two, poutine two.

This time it had larger fries, better smoked meat, but a gravy that I wasn't a fan of.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/esplanade-bier-markt-toronto?select=SGE9M4fQ611XkdQXupJ9SQ#densFidAujO-U8ZgStBOCw

If you're here, go for any of the mussel or flatbread dishes. Leave the poutine to the pros."}
{"text":"The food is very good and tasty. 
Unfortunately we were served by an unbelievably impolite waitress.
It took them 40 minutes to bring us our food and even a glass of water. So we asked nicely why is it taking so long; and if we can have some water.  She took it personally and told us \"excuse me ? you know what? Im gonna make you wait even longer now\".
And she even told us \"who said all the restaurants give water? Have you been in all the restaurants in montreal?\"
It was a terrible service and the employee seemed extremely furious and clearly didn't like her job.
It's very upsetting when a place gives very good quality food but the staff ruins it all. I would never recommend this place to anyone except if you're drunk and want to get even more drunk."}
{"text":"My wife and I are not Beer drinkers, but the group of people we were with are BIG beer drinkers.

We arrived at the place with a party of 10 at 5:00pm.  The staff there is so nice, they said they had a table of 10 reserved for a 7:30pm party so if we wanted to, we could use that table under the condition we have to be done around 7p.

You kidding me???  Of course we would be glad to do that.  (We had other dinner plans around 7 so it worked out for the best.)

My family/friends loved the beer selection.  I was looking forward to a nice selection of different brewed Root Beers only to be disappointed (I guess its a 'yank' thing).

My wife and I just ordered coffee, water and Poutine.  I gotta say, the Poutine was one of the best I have had.

The staff was one of the best out there for such a busy place that never seems to sleep.

If you like beer, go and enjoy.  If you are looking for a good root beer, go to the local Metro grocery and grab a 12 pack."}
{"text":"I had their chicken wings there, even though I wanted the duck wings and they had ran out (at 2 p.m). The wings were terrible and totally overpriced but on the plus side their beer was good."}
{"text":"After a rough day of exploring Montreal in the cold and pouring rain, dodging tourist traps and finding every restaurant in the area closed or closing, we came across this gem.  \"The name means Beer Store in German.\" I told my girlfriend.  \"Well it looks like people are eating upstairs\" she said.  \"Let's check it out!\" we said in unison.

The place was really busy but we found a seat at the bar.  The Canadiens game was on all the TVs and the crowd was really into it.  As hockey fans, we really enjoyed the atmosphere.  The bartender was very attentive and helpful, as was the menu, which quite literally doubled my beer knowledge as I read through the pages.  It was a very helpful way to present the 150 beer options that they had and I found myself trying beers I've never had before.  

The food was great, the highlight being the pastrami poutine which may have set the bar too high in comparison to other poutine we had in the city.  The beer can flammekueche was also great.  If you don't know what this is, (we didn't) it's a flat bread pizza or tarte flambee from the border of Germany and France.

I highly recommend this place to anybody and everybody who likes beer and great food."}
{"text":"Not too many options for food on the menu.  I usually order the flatbread which is good enough for me.  Love the drinks here, obviously. 

Last time I came here they had a live band, which was pretty good.  

The service here is impressive.  Impressive since the waiter remembered what each and every person ordered, and there were about 15 of us moving around all over the table.  He's good.

Overall, this place is good for beers and music, and socializing.  Sometimes I am bored here...  but maybe that's cause I'm just getting too old for it.  lol.  

3/5, food menu could be better.  And the venue itself is not the most upscale.  But good beer.

{"text":"Service was abysmal, waited 25min after being seated to order drinks and food. Tried to get a second drink and gave up after another 30min of waiting. Glasses were dirty and food was cold."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better\" sums up this place perfectly. The food most certainly doesn't justify the ridiculous prices. It is a better pub than it is a restaurant for sure. The beer list is the most extensive I've ever come across. But I prefer drinking local instead of paying an arm and a leg for some obscure European beer that has been sitting in a keg. The service is mediocre. We had a bad experience with sitting out on the patio on a chilly night and were astonished to discover they didn't have heaters. They handed out blankets like an airline."}
{"text":"I was co-organizing a social event for work, and given that work socials and alcohol seem to pair so perfectly together, Bier Markt appeared to be the perfect venue! (Okay, I lied. My first choice was Beer Bistro but they don't take reservations for groups over 8 and only offer their private room which has a $600 spending minimum. Take note, fellow work social organizers.) In desperation, I turned to my second option, Bier Markt, and overall was very pleased with my experience here tonight. 

I called on a Wednesday afternoon to make a reservation for 6:30pm on Friday night for a group of 15. They were able to accommodate my request, albeit with a few rules:

(1) Everyone must be charged on the same bill - no \"separate bill\" stuff happening.

(2) Automatic 15% gratuity.

(3) 15 minute grace period - after that, your table is up for grabs.

Ack! I hate rules, but at least they tell you all this up front so you can avoid any headaches later on.

I arrived on time but the rest of my party was running late. At 6:30 on a Friday night, it was already quite busy. I hovered anxiously by the door tapping my fingernails until they finally showed up 20 minutes later - thankfully no threats were made in terms of losing my reservation. We were seated at one of the long, picnic-style tables, which I loved...after all, what better way is there to get to know your coworkers than sidling up right beside them and drinking beer?

Our server was friendly, attentive and efficient, taking orders quickly, and bread was brought to the table some time later. In typical female fashion, I didn't even have to look at the beer menu before ordering the Fruli (YUM!!!), which was light and fruity and really hit the spot. I would say most beers average around $6-$9 each. As others have mentioned, extensive selection. You can also order a tasting selection of 6 beers for around $20, and they offer beer cocktails and the like as well. I wasn't hungry (only hungry for BEER) and didn't order anything to eat, so I can't speak much to the food menu, although others in my party who ate here seemed to be fairly satisfied.

The atmosphere is a bit dark and dingy, but the combination of the words \"bier\" (translation: beer) and \"markt\" (translation: market) don't exactly conjure images of clean, airy spaces filled with rainbows and butterflies. Yes, it is also loud, and yes, there is a chance you may see drunken men standing up on chairs and start singing loudly. But hey, if the company is good and the beer is good, what more could you really ask for?"}
{"text":"I walked in with a few friends on this dreary Monday afternoon and the restaurant was surprisingly empty. This was my first time at this location and my friends were relatively impressed by our surroundings.

Our waiter was awesome and came over right away to take our order.
I being a lover of girly/fruity beers immediately decided to get a Strawberry Fr√ºli. 

My friends were a bit undecided and instead (and overwhelmed by the selection). Instead of being annoyed or simply walking away our waiter suggested beers based on what my friends said they liked.

Next we ordered food.
I got the Smoked Chicken Flamekueches Belgian Flatbread and it was amazing! Qu√©bec brie, balsamic glazed cremini mushrooms, roasted garlic, parsley, and a lemon.

I highly recommend this location for a date night or intimate meeting with friends. It seems like it would be quieter than the Esplanade location."}
{"text":"The place is nice. Service is fast and friendly.

But the food..... Bad!!!! 

We had calamari, very chewy and some of the rings had white freezer burn. Bland and tasteless. We were 3 and we didn't finish the plate.

Then we all took the 25$ burger. Epic failure. Meat was bland and certainly not wagyu as stated in the menu. Bacon was only fat. It was so flabby and undercooked that all 3 of us removed it from the burger entirely. 

The only thing that was ok was the fries. 

One comment I have for the staff is to ask the customer if something was wrong when they see half eaten burgers and slabs of bacon on the plates when they clear the table."}
{"text":"I have been to numerous Bier markets, and good 80% of the time I leave out the door a happy and satisfied customer.
This location lacks good service, and quality seems to be a little off.
Usually get the samplers along with beer recommendations, probably was just an off day or a bad waiter, but that's unacceptable.
The muscles which are usually delicious, had a funny taste and smell.
Won't be repeating unfortunately, although it's a nice spot"}
{"text":"*****Gift card system is faulty, BEWARE***** This is not a food review (both food and alcohol are over priced, but great atmosphere), but my experience with using their gift card. I got a $50 gift card, used it once, and had $29.74 left on it. Ten days later, I went back to the same location, the waiter swiped the card and said the card had a $0.00 balance. Luckily I kept my previous receipt with the gift card balance. Brought it back to show to the manager. The manager swiped the gift card again and said that my waiter swiped it wrong and that they've been having issues with their system. I thought it was strange when the waiter asked me how much was remaining on the card. In the end, the manager refunded $30 cash to me. So if the next time someone says that your gift card is empty and it's not, talk to a manager!"}
{"text":"Came here for the 1/2 price mussels and $19.99 schnitzel deal.

Started off the meal with Gouda Bombs which came with a tomato jam, and they were delicious. The tomato jam was a bit sweeter than ketchup and complimented the smoked Gouda. If you like deep fried brie, I would definitely recommend trying the Gouda Bombs.

I got the Provencale mussels, which came with fries accompanied with 3 sauces: ketchup, mayo and what seemed to be a curry mayo, but I could be wrong. I was fairly disappointed in the mussels as they were so small, the meat being roughly the size of a quarter. The sauce was great and I wish I could've had some bread to dip in it. The fries were good, not too oily and I liked the variety in sauces.

My date had the veal schnitzel and he said it was good and I believe him as his plate was pretty clean when he was done. I do think that the portion was small for what it was, I would definitely not pay regular price for that.

I also got 3 oysters to try and they were okay. I'm not an oyster expert by any means, it's my second time having them. They came with 3 sauces (red wine, spicy tomato and a yellow radish-y one), a lemon wedge and horseradish on the side. 

Probably won't come back unless I'm in the area, or if I'm craving Gouda Bombs."}
{"text":"Came with a large group for some drinks after dinner one evening. The staff were friendly, the beer selection vast, and they had a solid crowd that showed up after the Leaf's game ended. 

Other than having to help the staff escort an unruly guest out of the bar, who was part of our group, I had a great time and had the opportunity to add two new beers to my pallet."}
{"text":"Though I was initially thrown off by the pricing, the food quality, ambiance and location work together to justify the price. 

PROs:
- Attention to detail:  from toasting buns to homemade BBQ sauce, the subtle things come together to create a burger that's better than the sum of its parts
- Special hot plate kept my burger warm (a detail special enough to merit it's own bullet)
- Great location for downtown bar hopping
- $20 beer sampler turnstile
- Service was 10/10 fast & friendly

CONs
- Location alone adds 15%-20% to the price tag. I would be a regular if they managed to bring the pricing down to Les 3 Brasseurs' level outside the downtown core.
- Others at the table complained about mussels' \"fishy-ness.\" Not having ever tried mussels, all I can testify to is that they stank up the table.

OVERALL
- Upgraded pub food at an upgraded price"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night before it was hopping and had a nice time on the patio, the service was good and the waitstaff were attentive if a bit overly busy.   Then we went in for dinner and had completely the opposite service, our waitress could care less what we wanted, rushed everyone and was so full of distaste for being there.   No follow ups except for the bill.   Seriously?"}

{"text":"We decided to come here for a drink and enjoy the last few days of sunny afternoon on the patio.

Service though slow to start but was quite attentive. Wait staff was trying to help with beer selection but she doesn't realize we were just trying to try some of the beers that we haven't tried yet.

Patio Patio Patio.... I wish Summer will last longer!

PS I found I always have a better experience without ordering food in most Bier Markt"}
{"text":"As promised, I was back on a sunny afternoon to Bier Markt  for a beer.

Happy Belgium Day Celebration from 2 pm - 4 pm was amazing. Free flowing Stella live entertainment and parade of finger food: sliders, chicken wings, smoked salmon, frites and chocolate cake.

Service was attentive and friendly even with me kept switching tables trying to get away from the sun.

I will be back during Happy Hour (5-7 pm) for their $1 oyster and $5 pint on another Sunny afternoon."}
{"text":"A little disappointed that this Bier Markt location no longer offers Happy Hour Special.

But the beer selection seems to get better with the newer beer menu, a lot of newer beers from smaller breweries from Canada, US and Belgium.

Patio seems to be decent but if you are a non smoker or allergic to smoke, you might not really enjoy the experience.

Goose Island Honker Ale and Rosarda which is not widely available on tap at other bars. The Seasonal rotating beers from Rogue, Quebec, Ontario and Fruit is quite interesting. 

Service is friendly and fast. A good place to have a beer or 2 or even catch a game on the huge TV!"}

{"text":"Only had the pleasure of attending this location once, but will definitely be back again. Main point - they serve Erdinger (Dark one) whereas some other spots that serve Erdinger do not serve the dark version. 

I would categorize this as a great place to go with mates to try out some beers. It was a Friday night and it seemed to be turning into more of a club/bar with live music just as we left. I would imagine given the local and clientele that we saw, that you could make a night of it if you really wanted to - I am sure you catch my drift!"}
{"text":"Frequently overheard at Bier Markt:

\"I think we're out of that one.\"

\"Oooh, we just ran out.\"

\"I don't think we've had that one for a while.\"

The beer menu here is really just for show. Not sure how Bier Markt gets away with it -- imagine going to a restaurant which doesn't actually serve 2/3rds of what is on the menu!"}
{"text":"went there on a Saturday night. 
I rate my 4/5 on the atmosphere, food, and drink menu.  they lose a point on service. 
the food was awesome honestly I don't even want to recommend anything specific bc we wanted to try a bit of everything, thus I feel you can't go wrong with a dish there. 
The crowd ranged  from people on dates, young crowds to mature crowds. 
They also had a live band playing... which I always find a bit too loud but that's just me. Drinks were cool, we ordered a range of beers to try. Personally I prefer a few Martinis.
Prices were as expected,  for four food and drinks would be about 300$? maybe more. Service though was meh. I'm starting to see a trend with restaurants and retailers, they literally hire anyone and don't bother training their staff on customer service. 
I would go back but maybe not this location just to change it up. I read they have a special on Thursday's on their duck wings! 
Setting: There's a dinning area, a bar section, and a lounge which was first come first serve. This location is close to public transit, lots of parking if you're driving, taxi cabs are near by too or I guess you can Uber it. I wouldn't recommend this place for a family with small kids.. especially on weekends, so I guess this is when mom and dad get a night out! thanks for reading my review, enjoy!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at bier market and only went here because of a friend's recommendation. I have never been a fan of beer but I fell in love with the belgian fruli beer. I wish you can buy it from the beer store. Their beer selection is impressive. I ordered the congo mussels and frites. The fries were ordinary but the sauce for the mussels was outstanding. I normally don't eat spicy food but I enjoyed my meal because of the nice curry sauce of the mussels. I just think fries and mussels don't really match and they should think of another side that a customer can choose from if they don't like the fries with it especially because there wasn't really anything special for the fries and the dip was just ketchup. A rice or maybe a specialty salad can make it a more enjoyable meal. 

Customer service was superb though. I'd probably go back, maybe for brunch next time."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago, and this last weekend was my first time visiting Toronto.  My best friend and I had decided to drive up to Niagara for a day and then a four day weekend in Toronto.  I have friends who have spent time in Toronto, one of whom is from Europe and spends the winter months in the US and Canada.  He recommended this place because of the beer selection, the interior, and of course the food.  

My girl friend and I decided to spend our last evening in Toronto here and have a nice dinner on the patio.  When we arrived, we were told there was about a 20 minute wait for the patio and were offered bar service while waiting.  The wait wasn't a problem, considering there are so many beers to look over.  They also have beer inspired cocktails, scotches, and wines.  A small complaint: This place is too dark.  They had all of the windows and doors open at the front of the restaurant, but they have curtains drawn to keep the sunlight out of the bar.  We could hardly read the tiny print of both the beer and food menus.  

The bartender was very friendly, and we even picked her brain a little about the ciders they offer.  In the states, we are used to Woodchuck or Crispins, both of which are more bitter than sweet and very bubbly.  We were presented with samples of their English cider, which was very smooth and sweet.  What really caught our eye were the beer inspired cocktails.  My girl friend went with a Bavarian Margarita (beer, house-made sweet syrup, and fresh lime juice) while I went with the Strawberry Dak (Fruli strawberry beer, Captain Morgan rum, and fresh lime).  Both were great!  After finishing our drinks and looking over the food menu we were ready to be seated.  I settled the tab at the bar with American cash, which was fine because the bar has a conversion system.

We were placed at a corner table on the patio next to a large group of people around our age (23-25) who were well dressed and seemed to have the same agenda as us: Enjoy the weather and some great food and beer.  Our server's name was Eileen, and she gave us a run down of the menus and presented the chef's cuts for the day.  We had pretty much decided in the bar what we had planned on ordering and went ahead and ordered two Fruli Strawberry beers with the Fondue (Pilsner and Ricotta cheese with cream fondue, served with Granny Smith apples, fingerling potatoes, and bread).  She returned with our beers, and about ten minutes later our food arrived.  Both the food and beer were superb.  However, a man rode up on a bicycle to join the group sitting by us.  He was wearing green board shorts and a green t-shirt with a silhouette of a woman on it with the word \"Vagitarian\" underneath.  He was loud and obnoxious, and after reading Lloyd L.'s comment about collared shirts I'm wondering why he was even allowed in the place.  He took a seat with the group and ordered a beer.  We tried to relax and enjoy our evening on the patio but found it difficult with the ambiance of that corner of the restaurant having been turned upside down.  

Our food had been cleared, our beers finished, and all that was left was to pay the bill.  Our server never came to check on us during our meal, but instead ogled over the group and their disruptive Vagitarian.  Every time she came back to wait on them, she would run off and ignore us asking for her attention.  The group decided to order shots of tequila and more beer, which then resulted in our final wait time for the check being 20 minutes.  It then took her another 5 to return with the check.  This is where our server really turned me off: \"We don't take debit cards, only credit or cash.\"  I explained my card was a debit/credit and could be processed as credit, but was told that they only take major CREDIT cards or cash, and if I didn't have cash there was an ATM in the front of the building.  That sounded a little absurd to me.  I then pulled out some American cash (since I was almost out of Canadian) for the bill and before I could get out the Loonies and Toonies for her tip, she roller her eyes, huffed, and stormed away.  Apparently American money is just about as good as Monopoly money to Eileen because on our way out she failed to acknowledge us and thank us for coming in.  

Here's a word of advice, Eileen:  Don't come wait tables in Chicago because if you think YOU can have an attitude, a Chicago girl can show you the definition attitude by leaving you a $1.00 tip on a $40.00 bill.  I sure hope the Vagitarian left you a better tip than I did, because he looked like he was going to have a hard time paying for the beer alone!  All in all, I would NOT recommend this place to any friends in and out of Toronto."}
{"text":"Not a bad first experience here. I have previously been to the Esplanade location (only once though) but this was my first time here. It was a Friday night, so the restaurant was pretty packed and the atmosphere was lively. Quite loud, and made it difficult to talk to my dining partner, since I felt like I had to shout. 

I ordered the Merchant burger which was a wagyu beef burger with onions, lettuce, bacon, tomatos, and some kind of BBQ fries. It also came with fries. 

The burger was alright, but didn't blow me away. Especially considering it was $25, it was just okay. The bun wasn't a regular sesame bun, but I liked it. For some reason the way they toasted it reminded me of grilled cheese. I liked that the burger was very thick and juicy, but it was a little too oily for my taste. Fries were also just mediocre as well. 

For dessert, we had the creme brulee. It looked so cute when it came because there were two French macarons! They were not bad, but nowhere near the best macarons. The creme brulee was interesting because they had some peach slices in it. Also there wasn't much of a burnt taste to it, which kind of disappointed me because then it just tasted like custard. 

Overall my food experience was just mediocre. No complaints about the service. I strongly believe that coming to Bier Markt is about the beer (they have a huge selection) and the experience, not the food. We stayed a bit to hear the live band play, and they were pretty good! I wouldn't come again solely for the food, but wouldn't mind coming for a chill Friday night out with drinks and live music!"}
{"text":"Visited this place few times, have a very mixed feeling about it. Service is very inconsistent, mostly poor, rude and not very knowledgable waitresses. Food is way overpriced, portions are small, some things are not so tasty (like cheese platters and flatbreads). Beer menu seems to be large at first, however the variety is not the best, lots of bottled ones. The atmosphere is ok, gets really loud after 10pm."}
{"text":"The sports ambiance is nice. The beer selection is outstanding. The service is good. The food completely sucks. Worse mussels i've ever eaten, they were smaller than green peas and didn't tasted anything. My wife had ribs and it was hard like rubber and didn't have any taste as well. The owner should review is food."}
{"text":"Food -  dont know! waitress couldnt recommend anything and send me to read menu! She said that menu is self explanatory! O_o

Service - 2/5. Yes they are busy but it is not an excuse to ignore me. + they dont take debit cards! They said they have atmosphere of 80s thats why they take visa but debit!  

Beer - 5/5. but they have nothing to do with it. Its not a brewery."}
{"text":"If you like trying different types of beer this is the place. Our server was great and was very knowledgeable on their beers.  The food order came out in good time.The menu had duck wings. They are worth trying. When I come back in the area I will visit this place."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends, anytime! Prior to a hockey game or just to hang around. Great and too much variety of beers : it so amazing ! The beer list is thicker than the actual food menu.

Despite being more like a sport bar, the actual food is better than most well-known type of restaurant.

Btw, they have great specials/deals everyday"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite chain restaurants now! The food was great, and they have a massive selection of beer. The atmosphere and service was pretty decent too. I got the chicken sandwich (ABT?) and it was stuffed with fresh avocado, crispy bacon and well-cooked chicken. The hand-made onion rings were well worth the $1 upcharge too. They were so tasty. I also got to try the risotto, which was also pretty good. Do try the Unibroue Blanche de Chambly beer."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever! A refill of water took over 15mins. My meal was a total of 2.5hours for lunch. Food was alright nothing amazing."}
{"text":"We went here for our last meal in Montreal and overall we weren't disappointed. The place was busy and had a good vibe. The waitress was very friendly and gave us great suggestions when we asked about items on the menu. It was $1 oyster night so we couldn't say no. They were pretty small though. We had the steak cut citrus calamari as part of our appetizer, I would definitely tell you to skip that. It had a weird texture that just wasn't appetizing. We had strawberry beer and the white sangria. I don't drink beer but it was pretty good and my sister enjoyed it. A large beer selection for those who like beer and most of the items on the menu have a beer suggestion next to it. The white sangria was delicious. For our meal we ordered the rigatoni bolognese, the beet salad with salmon and the Atlantic salmon. For dessert we had the flourless chocolate cake which came with chocolate gelato. The cake was dense and very rich. The gelato was good. Prices are reasonable, definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"The Bier Markt is what my wise old pappy used to call a \"horse of many feathers.\" Sometimes it's a gastropub with decent eats and an impressive selection of beer, and sometimes it's a lifesized whack-a-mole of douche-baggery (i.e., a club), filled to the brim with well-lubricated MBAs and girls wearing invisa-skirts. It's for this latter aspect that I write this review.

I'll to my best to appreciate this place as Friday Night Bar qua Friday Night Bar. Compared to club district this place is like the Royal Ontario Museum on the first day of an Egyptian uncrating: downright civilized. The bouncers here aren't tweaking meatheads on power-trips, the line actually MOVES based on capacity (as patrons left, new people got in), and the clientele aren't really the greasy, over-dressed, roofie-or-be-roofied, gel-slathered assholes that are crawling all over Richmond Street on a typical Friday night. You won't ever feel like you're going to get shot at the BierMarkt and that's a good thing.

The downsides of this place betray my old-fogeyism more than anything else. BM is packed and impossible to navigate, pretty damn loud (especially near the stage if there is a live band), the floors are sticky, and it smells like beer in here (duh right?). Five years ago (OK fine, ten) these could have been selling points for me. Now they are annoyances, but minor ones at that. That night, I never had to wait long to get a drink (OK fine, I was parked at the bar), and that's probably my #1 pet peeve about these places. When we were booted at 2am, they weren't dicks about it.

So yeah, good times. I'd avoid showing up at 11:00pm on a Friday like I did, as there is a long wait ahead of you. But it's not a vanity line, and once you do get in, you will actually be able to get a drink. Trust me, you may need it.

Obligatory Title Pun: A dare you to find a LAGGER line up OR: This place is HOPPING!

Menu Readability: I just look at the handles on the taps.

Need to mention: They have LOTS of beer on tap and good ones too. Don't be a douche and order a cocktail. Seriously.

What this place teaches me about myself: I don't have a \"pappy\" and no he didn't say that. But still, I miss him dearly, as fictional as he is."}
{"text":"good food, good beer selection and some HOT bartenders. But crowded and  full of wanna be Frat boys and Urban GIRlillas.  Still  I like the mussels."}
{"text":"I went on Friday night with a couple of friends and the atmosphere was great. I like the overall set up of the restaurant / bar area. We waited about an hour for our table but just watched the Raptor's game while we were drinking at the bar and we already knew there would be a wait as we tried to get a reservation but apparently our group of 7 was too small.

The menu has rather pricey items and I was in the mood for a burger (how typical) which was delicious. So I cannot say much about the overall quality of food. Ladies at my table had the chicken and salmon and said it was delicious. We also started with a flat bread (IER CAN CHICKEN~ Bier can chicken, Brie de Portneuf cheese,roasted cremini mushrooms, cr√®me fra√Æche, roasted garlic) to be exact which is great for sharing- nice size and delicious.

The Merchant burger was cooked medium which is nice - so it didn't taste over cooked or too charred. The toppings on it were pleasant and typical, but it was a rather tasty burger. It was paired with their frites which were also delicious and they had great sauces for dipping (another favourite of mine).


At around 9:30-10pm we headed to the dance floor, the live band was already playing. They were great at getting the crowd going but nothing spectacular in terms of sound/voice.

I loved the idea of the DJ coming in between sets and his music selection was great, a mix of old and new. The dance floor is barely in existence but that was alright for the type of place it is. 

The bartender who served us all night was awesome- he was knowledgeable and made suggestions!

I will go back and try something outside of the burger ;)"}
{"text":"If I could give this negative stars I would.

An hour and counting waiting for food. Asked for water and the waitress slammed the glass down, and the cup is so dirty.

Waitress spent 20 minutes flirting with peolle the table beside us instead of checking our order.

Cancelled order, waitress didn't apologize at all for the terrible service."}
{"text":"This place is a tourist trap. It is located across the street from the Sheraton Hotel. Went here this past Friday during lunch. I ordered steak with fries. When another waitress brought and placed my food on the table, she just placed it quickly and left without noticing I did not have eating utencils. I had to wait another 10 minutes for my server to come back so that I could ask her for a knife and fork.The steak was charred and chewy on one side. After I ate, I was still hungry so I asked for the menu again. I ordered a soup. After 30 minutes of waiting, I canceled the soup and asked for the bill. I informed the waitress that the steak was burned and showed her the pieces I had chiseled off, but she didn't seem to care. This place is expensive, the service is horrible, and the food is not worth it. I also overheard the lady next to me complaining that her salad was not good. Being that this is Montreal, and that there is plenty of culinary competition, don't waste your time with this place, unless you are just coming to drink."}
{"text":"great variety of beers -- and guidance in helping to select.  very good service and food."}
{"text":"We came here at 11:30am on a Friday without reservations and Bier Markt was able to accommodate seating indoors for our large group. Unfortunately our group was too large for outdoor seating. The inside of the restaurant is expansive with many tables and soon after we sat down, there were tons of people filing in. There were enough waitresses to cover every group but towards the end when we were ready for our check, we had to wait about 10 minutes.

I ordered the fish and frites ($16). I was a little hesitant because there are lots of restaurants that just don't do it well. However, that was not the case here at Bier Markt. They did an amazing job on the fish. It was still light and the batter was a nice light golden color. I was very pleased that it wasn't overcooked. The fries were good as well.

I'd definitely come back for their fish and frites."}
{"text":"If you love beer then this is the right place to be.  What I like most about the bier market are they yummy beer cocktails.

I'm not much of a huge beer fan so drinking beer alone is not so good for me.  Having beer cocktails are tasty.

Food is good but a little overpriced."}
{"text":"1 guy 5 Biers

I really wanted to come here for one reason and one reason alone: Beer! So that being said, this place has the largest selection of beers I have ever seen! Needless to say I was in beer heaven. I love the fact that you can try so many different beers all in one place. They have a special where for $20 you get to sample 6 different beers. The reason I say sample is because these beer glasses are much smaller than your average pint glass, but it's actually not too bad because if you ordered six pints, you would probably be incapable of differentiating between flavours of beer. 

The food was good (but pricey) and the service was decent. I came here with my gf and two friends and when we got to the door the bouncer stopped us from walking in and said: \"Hold on! We need to do a head count.\"  So we were like oh snap, it seems busy, hopefully there is room for us. We get inside and the place is practically empty. We were so confused lol but happy there was seating accommodation. Later in the evening there was a live band which is always nice but they were way too loud. Personally I'm a fan of loud music but it was annoying that I couldn't hear the person across the table from me. 

Overall I enjoyed this place but only because I love beer. If you're not a beer lover, then I don't recommend this place, but if you are, then you should definitely check it out! I know I will be back"}
{"text":"Overall I found this place to be.... 'confused'. It's got the prices of a fine restaurant, but the experience is far from fine dining. 

I was offered a German beer and was quite pleased with it.

The presentation of our plates was excellent, service was quick and despite the fact that the place was packed, we got served quickly.

We were ready to 'dig in' - but when we did we found the food to be uninspired, just plain; somewhat dull. Paying $30 for a Schnitzel I was hoping for a little more you know...

The place is extremely noisy! I could barely hear the other people at my table and when the live music started that was it - no more talking...

The band was good.

I would come back to this place to have a beer and listen to live music, not to have dinner though. For that there are better options at better prices all around it."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try this place considering my husband is a self professed beer snob, and I'm such a foodie! 
Set off to explore . Made 8:30 reservations and glad I did. Packed house.  On a  Sunday night to boot!
Walked in at  8:28 and our table was ready.
They advertise 130 beers from over 30 countries! I was thinking wow. Thank god we walked to this place cause this might be dangerous!  
Unfortunately they only offer 3 types of \"fixed\" flights.  A European, and Canadian & a IPA mix.  Too bad you couldn't mix and match.  They did have about 30 Taps.  The rest bottles or cans.  He ordered a Rochefort 10 it's a Belgian quadruple .  14.00 a bottle, and he said it was worth it.  He also had the Canadian flight special at 15.00
I had a \"Ceaser\" cocktail.  A version of a Bloody Mary but even better.  It was so good.  Real good.  Wish I could take 3 to go!! Only 9.00 and it's a free appetizer to boot!  It had dried sausage pickles smoked Gouda candied bacon on a skewer.  Absolutely delicious! 
We decided on the 50 ounce Tomahawk!  Comes with bone marrow, fingerling potatoes, baby bok choy and FF's.  Since it came  with potatoes already I asked if we could skip the ff's and get a salad.  She said fine.  But I was charged 7.00 for lettuce with no dressing.  Not a big deal but 7.00? $ 99.00 for a dinner for two, and  7.00 for lettuce is crazy.  That aside, it was good. Ordered it medium rare, came out medium.  Didn't say anything,  cause you can't change medium.  I figured in my head, it's not 99.00 to me, since the US dollar is strong here, so I let it go.  Trust me if it was back home, that steak would have gone back!! 
Service was good.  Our waitress was so sweet.  The place  had a upscale feel to it even though it had TV's neatly displayed all over.  Overall the beer added the extra star to the 3 star food rating making this  a 4 star review!"}
{"text":"Great place to casual have a beer and listen to live music on the weekends. There is no cover which is rare for places with live bands. The beers are regular priced along with a wide selection. Recommend for all group sizes."}
{"text":"Not bad, but for being a \"Bier Markt\" their servers know absolutely nothing about serving beer, especially Belgian beer.  Some of the food was very good, and some not so much. 

They have a good European beer selection, including some of the top Belgians (in theory...they were out of 2 of the best, Rochefort 10 & St. Bernardus 12).  Their American beer selection is abysmal, but other international beers are okay.  You would think that a place with \"Bier\" in the name would train their servers on how to serve beer!  Several of us ordered Belgian beers included a few Trappists.  These are bottle-conditioned and have lots of yeast / trub on the bottom, and you should basically never pour this into your glass unless it's a wit / wheat. 

Sadly I noticed too late that our server already poured my beer (Rochefort 8), proceeded to swirl the hell out of the last 2\", and dumped it into the glass.  If you don't know anything about beer, please note:  never do this.  Ever.  To a beer nerd, this is the equivalent of ordering Kobe beef extra-well done, with a side of ketchup & Tabasco.  If you had an old bottle of wine, would you swirl it first, to make sure your wine was extra chunky?  Of course not, you'd decant it first.  Same goes for bottle-conditioned beer.  This ain't rocket science, it's your job.

For food, I had mussels; $21 for a kilo.  Not horribly overpriced, but way overcooked.  the right way to cook mussels is to take them out as soon as the shells pop open.  The wrong way to cook them, a la Bier Markt way, is to continue cooking them for at least 10 more minutes, so that they shrivel up into tiny balls of overcooked mussel.  It's a shame, because their broth was tasty.

Lessons learned here folks:  if you order a bottle of beer, POUR IT YOURSELF.  When ordering mussels, specify that they're brought out immediately after opening.  With those instructions, this is a 4 to 5 star joint."}
{"text":"Got sick after eating the raw chicken wings they served me. Beer is good but food quality sucks here"}
{"text":"Beautiful patio partly in the shade on a hot day. Fantastic selection of beer and cider. The big problem was with the mussels.

I ordered a large portion of Thai green curry-style mussels. At first they seemed okay. The broth was tasty, although the coconut milk had split a little bit. The mussels were nice and plump. After the first few, I counted no fewer than 10 of the mussels that were either completely shut or impossible to open, which suggests they were already dead before they were cooked, i.e. a health hazard. I called over our server to send them back. She apologized profusely, let me take the fries and baguette off the platter, and offered me either replacement mussels or another dish. I ordered a replacement set, or so I thought.

After about 15 minutes, she came back and apologized again and said the mussels were taken off the bill. She was empty-handed. I thought maybe I had been unclear that I wanted a replacement dish, but my friend echoed my confusion when he asked me, \"Where's the new order of mussels you asked for?\"

By that time, I was already full on the excellent fries and cider; so I just let it go. Perhaps it was a blessing in disguise. My friend's mussels √† la proven√ßale were excellent; he had no problems whatsoever.

At the end of the meal, the bad mussels were indeed taken off the bill. Our server was very apologetic, but even perfect service - much less the extra mis-step of not replacing the order - could not excuse the complete miss of serving 10+ unsafe mussels. To me, this is the same as getting a plate of raw, bloody chicken. You can't let such a dish leave the kitchen. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Seriously an amazing place. My first visit to Montreal, and Canada in general, was amazing and Bier Markt was so amazing I had to come back a second time! The Goji Chicken is amazing, the burgers are good, and chocolate fondue is to die for with dark chocolate with a glass of Mort Subite or the peach beer. Duck wings are also very delicious! And I don't like duck. Will definitely come back here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Came on a game night, you can literally stumble out of here and fall into the Centre Bell. They have over 150 beers to choose from and the staff totally knows their stuff. The food was great (red curry mussels, YUM!) and the entire menu comes with beer recommendations for every option. The fact that we were able to get a table for 4 on a Saturday game night was astounding and better yet, we were met with zero attitude from the hostess which I was expecting and were told that they actually had 3 floors to accommodate people. I will definitely be back here as there is literally something for everyone, the food was tasty and the portions were ample. Loved the brick decor and all of the red: great space with a private room should you want to hold an event here as well."}
{"text":"great find after a 7-hr drive from nyc. they have plenty of beer selections and they even suggest a pairing with whatever food you're getting. I got the schnitzel and my husband a salad. i also had a flight of wine which was nice to get a variety. Husband had a nice chimay...forgot the spelling. waitress was attentive."}
{"text":"A good place for a snack and beer. The space is pretty huge. Our server was very nice and helpful. The wurst sampler is huge. The flavors don't vary much and would be better if it was served with pretzel rolls."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer, convenient downtown location, ample seating, what's not to love right? Well, a few things. I teeter-tottered between two and three stars for Bier Markt for awhile. Ultimately, it arrives at three because I'll go back.  

The Good:

Great beer selection, Plenty of taps, plenty of bottle choices, great menu for those not familiar. Also, they even do beer pairing recommendations! The menu, is well rounded, and has great lunch choices. The ambiance is fantastic. On paper, this is a great lunch spot. A nice touch is the correct use of appropriate glasses for the various styles of beer. Good prices on most things in bottle. Free coat check during winter.

The Bad:

Consistency and speed. Lunch rushes are always hard on a new establishment, and it shows. Unlike it's Ontario brethren, the kitchen was slow. Being seated at the bar, the bar tender was attentive, friendly, warm. Much to offset the nearly 35-45 minute wait for anything coming out of the kitchen, Alas, when over half an hour had passed without seeing a french fry, I inquired, and was informed it was typical for 40+ minute waits for the kitchen. 40 minutes? Downtown? For lunch? Eek, for a place perfect to catering to the businessman lunch, that hour is a hard time constraint.  As to consistency, personally my fries we're perfect, my burger over cooked (I'm not a fan of well-done), my companion however received under-seasoned fries, but a nice medium burger.  I'll chalk this up to a kitchen that's behind, and that to being young. Given the wait, result, and price, it's disappointing. 

TL;DR, Issues, Pricey,  but the beer selection and prospect of greatness will make me revisit Bier Markt, and this review in the future. Skip it for now if you're trying to get in an hour lunch break, or get there early."}
{"text":"The name suggests a beer hall - and the Markt certainly does beer very well.  Done in the style of a Belgian brasserie, they offer 150 different styles of beer from 25 different countries, primarily Belgium.  But if you come for the beer (or is that bier?) you will be pleasantly surprised by the food.  The menu, although small, features a few outstanding selections including their flatbreads, mussels and steak frites. The menu also gives beer recommendations for each of its dishes.  A great patio and live entertainment Thursdays through Saturday evenings round out the experience.  It is recommended that you call first, as the Markt often hosts special events sometimes with cover charges."}
{"text":"The wait staff here are excellent, I have no complaints about the service here, but the food I had was horrid. 

I ordered the mussels provencale which cost $22 for a large pot and they were pallid and had no flavour. The dish itself smelled overwhelmingly of the huge hunks of raw and barely cooked onion in the dish. The sauce was grey and tasted like dirty dishwater. 

The waitress substituted the snob mussels in a small pot when I mentioned my issue and while marginally better, this pot too was mostly tasteless, overcooked, and had that awful onion smell.

I would not come here again given the choice."}
{"text":"I reserved a table Friday night at 9:30 pm for 10:30 the same night.   I'm so glad I did.  It gets busy after the Bell centre lets out.  The food was excellent and so was the live music.  The place has a great vibe.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I would stick to lunch or dinner. Mussels are great and a good place to share some appys and a drink. Brunch is horrible. Small portions, cold and tasteless. Who serves an English muffin without butter or jam?"}
{"text":"Spot-on delicious succulent Sirloin Steak BUT one side was a bit tough. The flavour was delectable and totally makes up for cutting it with a steak knife. Its an 8oz served with carrot & asparagus saute with an enlightening French butter on top. Reg. 25, Promo until May 30 is $20! The Veal had a Yukon mash with tomato jam and gravy. The best part was the lemon caper emulsion to make it energize your mouth with exceptional zingy taste. Reg. $26, Promo until May 30th is also $20. You shant be dissapointed by these two meals but a tiny little bit more extra love on the steak would be awesome."}
{"text":"I went to check out the awfully named \"Fond√ºe Feastiv√ºl\" (seriously guys, are so many umlauts necessary??) tonight. Making a reservation over the phone brought back memories of Terroni - a list of rules was emailed to me and I was warned that our party was under no circumstances to stay past 9:30pm. Fine.

CHEESE FONDUE:
We ordered three types. None of the pots were hot when they arrived so we had to do some stirring:

1) Cheese & Lager ($17) 
Appenzeller, Emmenthal, Raclette cheese with Stella Artois Lager. This was the best fondue of the bunch (cheese was sharp/zesty) but the grape tomatoes and asparagus served for dipping were pitiful servings. The baguette was slightly stale, but maybe this was a good thing since it meant it wouldn't fall apart after dipping. 

2) Chevre ($18) 
Woolwich Farms goat cheese, roasted beets, asparagus, crispy risotto cakes, fresh baguette. I didn't see any beets, again, the asparagus was sad-looking. I think the risotto cakes, while tasty, were made with fish so beware if you're not a seafood eater. The Woolwich Farms goat cheese is a sight to behold. Get it (they also have it in a brunch omelette)!

3) Smoked Danish Fondue ($17): I didn't try this as it had bacon in it.

DESSERT FONDUE:
The server dropped off our food without igniting any of the pots, but luckily a person in our party had a lighter handy, so we figured it out. All of the chocolate had to be pre-melted a bit. 

1) Belgian Chocolate ($15)
Valrhona dark Manjari chocolate with French macarons, biscotti, layfingers, bananas, strawberries. Yummy, although the portion seemed smaller than the usual chocolate fondue served at Bier Markt. The dipping vehicles, with the exception of the biscotti, were scrumptious. High quality chocolate.

2) Caramel & Toffee ($16)
Ladyfingers, French macarons, biscotti, layfingers, bananas, strawberries, housemade marshmallows. The caramel was just OK - I much preferred the chocolate.

SERVICE:
We had been warned that gratuity would be included for a party of six or more but thankfully this wasn't the case, because our server didn't quite deserve 15%. We had to chase her down to clear our plates, to bring us water and to make room for the next round, as well as to pay (see also: disappearing act). 

When we left at 9 o'clock Bier Markt was TEEMING with barrel-chested bouncers - both at the entrance and milling about in the restaurant. I dunno, is that really necessary? Everyone seemed relatively well-behaved, even though the douche clientele quotient increased tenfold with each passing minute as the night wore on. I would caution strongly against coming here after 9pm on a Friday or Saturday night; it'll be a different story."}
{"text":"Our first winterlicious adventure, it was pretty mediocre. 
The appetizer was interesting, the entree was not so good and the dessert was the best part. Service was super slow and we waited over an hour for food. I would not recommend to come to this place with a party bigger than 5. I can't believe they had the nerve to ask us to pay gratuity when they didn't come to refill our water, there was a fly in their food and the bill took over 15 minutes to come. Definitely a disappointment in the whole establishment."}
{"text":"Ive been here many times but last week while waiting for patio seats  the bartender during lunch was quick and friendly.  Efficient wait staff and professional and observant.   Was during lunch rush around 1250 and i hope to return to this venue because service was so good."}
{"text":"I rarely eat game, so when Bier Markt offered a game menu for last November, I couldn't wait to try it out. My friend got the Elk Chop: 12oz bone-in Alberta Elk chop grilled med-rare, mashed Ontario yam, baby turnips, roasted beets with cherry reduction. The rich sauce somewhat masks the \"gamey\" flavour of the meat. I quite enjoyed this from the 2 bites that I had, but the root vegetables felt a little like Chinese food done wrong. 

I chose something from the brunch menu, the Monte Cristo: egg-dipped challah bread with emmental cheese and smoked turkey, served with maple syrup. This was a delight! I absolutely loved the combination of the sweet and the savoury (like eating french toast with a ham and cheese!), and the smokiness from the meat added a wonderful kick to the sandwich. And plus, maple syrup makes everything taste better =D

For desserts, we shared a pumpkin Cheesecake spiced creme fouette, toasted walnuts croquant. This dessert was awesome and made our day! The pumpkin flavour really came through, and the creaminess of the cake was well-balanced by the crunchy nut coating. Bonus points for pretty plating! Too bad they don't have this dessert all year round! I really hope they can bring it back this year too!"}
{"text":"As per my usual tradition, I went to Bier Markt's annual fondue festival. I'm so glad that Bier Markt opened a location at Shops at Don Mills! Now I don't have to go all the way downtown to get my yearly fondue fix!

I'm not a big beer drinker, but I do like fruity ones. I ordered a Somersby apple cider and it was absolutely delicious!

Now onto the fondues!

Chorizo und fondue- smoked chorizo sausage, Quebec cheese curds, toasted bistro bread, served with Menchego and roasted red pepper fondue. This was my favourite of the two. I loved dipping a buttery, cheesy toasted sandwich into more cheese, and the red pepper flavour in the fondue paired wonderfully with the sandwich. In fact, I would've gladly eaten the chorizo sandwich without the fondue accompaniment. 

Normandy fondue- Camembert cheese and cider, Kozlik's sweet and smokey Dijon, served with sourdough boule, granny smith apple, and smoked farmer's sausage. The mustard was rather pungent, and I found it a little overwhelming. I'm actually a great fan of mustard, but it was a bit too much in the fondue.

In the end, we finished the entire red pepper fondue, but there was a lot of the Normandy fondue left. 

Sadly, we didn't have any room to try the dessert fondues. In particular, the cheese und cake fondue sounds absolutely amazing! I'm imagining it in my head like a molten cheesecake! Next year, I'll be sure to come with more people so we can try out more varieties!"}
{"text":"Came here for their annual fondue festival in February. It was great, and the ambiance was very lively. Parking was a little tricky though."}
{"text":"Acrually my meal was very average. I would have given a 3.5 star. We sat on the 3 floor which i did not even know existed. I had the chicken schnitzel which was good. A little more dryier then the pork. Veggies were good. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"This review would have been five stars, if I had just left my visit to Friday, instead of coming again Sunday night. 

So I came in on Friday evening with my boyfriend; our server was amazing! She was friendly, super helpful and knowledgeable with her menu (she gave great suggestions that I ended up loving), and she checked in on us as a server should.

Now, I'm not from Montreal, and I have been a server myself for nearly a decade. I'm a firm believer that no customer owes you a tip, and your tips are a reflection of your service (that, or maybe the customer is just cheap af, who knows). With that being said, here's how my Sunday evening at this place turned out:

My boyfriend and I were spending our last night in Montreal close by our hotel (we stayed here for three days, on Victoria Day long weekend). We opted to stay close by, just to save time on having to travel back to our hotel seeing as though we'd be leaving the next day.  We decided on coming back to bier market since we had a good time on Friday. We walked in (downstairs was pretty packed) stood by the hostess stand for a minute, and I noticed the bartender (no one else was on the floor) being crazy busy; you could see on her face she was prioritizing what she needed to do. Since no one had approached us we decided to seat ourselves. Grabbed a high top table right in front of the bar.  We sat there for a few minutes, STILL no one had approached us, and I began to tell my boyfriend about how much I can sympathize with the bartender because at this point it seemed like she was working the entire first floor alone, and I remembered how stressed I was doing the same. So we patiently waited. And she finally came along, before she took our drink order I asked for a food menu, which was my mistake, cause that added another two minutes to our wait time. We finally got our order out of the way and then our food and beer came. 

While sitting there, just observing, she was totally running around like a headless chicken, at this point it seemed like no one else was working in the place, (which I know wasn't true because more than enough people ended up downstairs around closing time). She had sooo many dirty tables with cups everywhere sitting for over ten minutes before any other workers came around to help. 

At this point, that's ridiculous. You don't leave your staff hanging like that. Even if their service is amazing, no single person can handle over forty people in a room without hella delayed service, and leaving the place looking like a disaster. Yeah the money might be great at the end of the night, but your shitty service will be remembered. 

So near the end, we asked for another pint each, and the bill. Bill was brought then paid. As a server, I've been left pretty shitty tips. But hey, that's life, you get shitty tips with shitty or excellent service. You're lucky to even receive a tip at all.

This bartender, I don't even know her name because she never told us, nor was it on the bill (I could be blind if it is)  came back up to us to ask if there was something wrong with our time there. I already knew where this convo was going to go, and I knew my big mouth would just get me in trouble so I left it up to my boyfriend. She proceeded to remind us that a normal tip is roughly 15%. 

Ok hi, I would leave NO tip for someone who gave me shit service, because again customers do not OWE you anything. I would throw a hundred dollar bill at you as a tip if I believed you deserved it.

Anyway, I only encountered two servers at this place, and this place could use another lovely server from Friday for their Sunday evenings. And maybe schedule another server because this bartender can NOT execute great service in a place that big with that many people. Again, if unless you were superwoman, I don't know who would be able to.

Don't come here on a Sunday unless you want to wait"}
{"text":"Pricey but really nice place for after-work drinks with friends. This place is all about the beer but I was starving when I got there so I ordered the flat bread prosciutto pizza. It had a crispy base and was topped with shredded cabbage, pickles, tomatoes, and meat. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"My most recent visit really soured me on this location.

We arrived to 7 staff at the entrance who were lost in something on a paper at the entrance.  Our group of 4 waited ignored for ten minutes and finally interrupted them to see if we should keep waiting.  They told us to seat ourselves.  We did, only to be scolded for seating ourselves by another server.  A manager had to be found to see if we could retain our table.  We were allowed to stay? In any event, things happen... moving on.

I ordered the pok√©.  To some extent this is on me, pok√© at the Bier Markt .... still it was inedible.  It was served as a block on refrigerated normal rice.  I have no idea why they don't use sushi rice but if you have eaten cold normal rice you can imagine what a bad idea it is to use it as a base for anything.  The seafood pur√©e on top was as terrible.  Not appetising at all.  

I had others try it and same verdict.  The worst thing I have ever ordered.  How did this get on a menu?

To be be fair, those that I was with were happy with they ordered but my over all experience was terrible.  Stick to the beer."}
{"text":"So what if you wanted a more chill environment to celebrate your birthday, but still lively enough for some excitement? Bier Markt can definitely be an option. I had a really close friend that decided to celebrate her birthday at Bier Markt. Now Bier Marky has two locations. There's one on King West and one on Esplanade. Both locations have it's pros and cons, where the King West one is a little more intimate as its smaller in size and the one on Esplanade is bigger which has has two floors. So it really comes down to preference. I would say King West is a little more chill and Esplanade is for large crowds. But both are definitely packed on the weekend and be careful as it does get crammed.

We headed there around 11 and my friend called ahead to put us on the guest list. They don't allow reservations for tables at this time as it's packed, so definitely call ahead get on the guest list. Now Bier Markt is exactly what it sounds, it's basically a pub packed with a TON of beer. They have over 100 brands of beer from over 24 countries around the world. So this would definitely be the time to try beers from all around. For the night, there was a live band which totally killed much of the conservations anyone was having.

I had to keep an eye on my good friend, so I didn't have a lot.. but I did try a few such as the Beau's beer from good'ol Vanleek Hill, Ontario. I picked this one as I quite like the Mill Stream Organic beer. Now when it's fresh and right out of a good tap, it's sooo refreshing. So I was hoping for the same affect with Beau's. Now Beau's wasn't badd, I got the flagship version, but I would have to say I prefer Mill Stream Organic. I also tried out the Leffe Brune which is a dark amber beer from Belgium. And I have to say I enjoyed this one quite a bit. It had good body to the beer and went down smooth. I took a sip of my other friend's beer... it came in a large tall beer glass, I think it was either German or Russian and it wasn't bad at all. The birthday girl had the Strawberry Fruli. Actually, she had quite a number of them and why not, it's her birthday. Taste wasn't bad and I can see why she would enjoy it.

Overall, I would have to say, I'm mixed on Bier Markt. If you're hoping to go there for conversation, bad idea. It was basically a shouting match to simply talk to someone. But if you wanna just go there and try beer, not a bad choice. There have a ton and tho price is a little steeper, they know their stuff. From the servers to how they keep and serve the beer, it was all done well. Outside of the weekend, it's okay to bring someone there and to talk, but on the weekends, just know you wanna go there to try beer and maybe to just get hammered. Be warned peeps. =P"}
{"text":"I tend to avoid the big flashy restaurants... especially in the ones in the downtown core. Part of me is always leery. When your main clientele is tourists and the business crowd - simply by location alone - there is a good chance that the food is not necessarily up to par with the cost associated to the meal. Now, I am always willing to be proven wrong so when I had a chance to try Bier Markt for the first time recently, I went in with an open mind.

For the uninformed, Bier Markt is a Toronto chain of restaurants that came to Montreal and took over the old Queue de Cheval location in front of the Bell Centre. Bier Markt's claim to fame is the ridiculous amount of beers they have available - over 150 beers from 30 different countries. The selection is extremely varied and quite good. The beer menu is nicely elaborate. It does a great job of categorizing and describing each beer to help with selection. The prices vary widely though which is a bit strange. I also appreciated that the food menu provides recommendations with pairing for each dish. For a restaurant like this, that detail is essential and provides a nice way to try new beers.

Foodwise, the menu is a mixture of beer garden and classic bar/pub fare. My friends and I went for three starters initially. First up was the French onion soup au gratin with caramelized onions, house veal stock, toasted bread and Gruy√®re cheese. Personally I did not try it but the response from my friends was good - not great.

Next was the baked Brie with Granny Smith apples, lingonberry jam, roasted pecans, pickles and baguette crisps. The jam was nice but once again, overall the dish was good, not great. The portion size was only not that great considering its cost either.

The final entree was the baked crab dip - wild Canadian rock crab, white cheddar, cream cheese, Old Bay spices and toasted house flatbread. This was a more interesting and well done dish. Very creamy with nice pieces of meaty crab within. Main issue once again though was the size relative to the price. Very limited amount of flatbread and frankly, this appetizer was barely sufficient for me much less as a dish to share - which at its price point, it needs to be.

Prior to the description of the mains, I will just take a moment to discuss the service. Now, for the most part, I am pretty relaxed about service in general - I simply want timely, friendly with a good handle of the menu. However, there are a few things that are BIG no-nos for me. One of them is very simple - you should never serve the next course without clearing the table first. During our meal, not only was that done but that was after all the empty dishes were left in front of us for about 20 minutes before serving. On top of that, the waitresses serving our table had no clue who had which main so the second course became a awkward and complicated dance of simultaneously removing, moving temporary around and serving dishes. And then, the same thing was repeated at dessert time later on! With the number of waitresses working around us, these were big red flags about the quality of service.

Back to the food now. The first main was the Merchant burger - 10 oz. Wagyu beef burger, smoked bacon, charred red onion, vine-ripe tomato, iceberg lettuce, \"Bier 58\" sauce, toasted bun with house frites. A good sized burger - a little overcooked for my liking but still flavourful. A solid burger but again for its price, more was hoped for.

I personally went with the Chicken ABT - fresh chargrilled chicken breast, avocado, crisp smoked bacon, vine-ripe tomato, shaved iceberg lettuce and honey Dijon aioli in a Portuguese roll served with fries. The sandwich was good but somehow left me underwhelmed and wishing I had ordering something else. Some extra aioli and avocado may have helped to provide more kick but otherwise I felt the sandwich lacked pop. The fries were nice and crisp at least - very classic bistro style.

The final main was the smoked pork back ribs which are spice-rubbed and smoked for 6 hours, served with a golden BBQ sauce, fries and a red cabbage & caraway slaw. The ribs were nice and tender but because the sauce needed to be added by the client, they were a little dry. The BBQ sauce was a necessity to add, not a choice.

The final dish we ordered was the waffle ice cream sandwich - house-baked chocolate waffles served warm with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Best thing we had all night - creative, chocolatey and rich. Always nice to end a meal on a positive.

In the end, Bier Markt left me cold. The beer selection was nice and varied - definitely the draw to coming back. However, the food was uninspiring and simply okay. The service was poor. Okay food can be acceptable at certain times but not when my personal bill was 80$ without tip. At that price, there are a heck of a lot better options I can enjoy. Bier Markt is a great happy hour spot for excellent beer but not a worthwhile dining option.

Cheers!"}

{"text":"Their selection of beer is 10/10, they have some of my favorite European beers that I can't find elsewhere so that keeps me coming back. However, I tried their food for the first time tonight and wasn't too impressed. My burger and fries were alright, but my partner's chicken wings were so dry and crunchy we asked them to take it away because it was too hard to eat. The desserts were pretty good tho, we had donuts, bieramisu and chocolate cake which were all tasty. The service was poor too, we asked to get glasses of water about 5 times before we finally got some. Also the fire alarm went off randomly for a good 5 minutes which was mad annoying. Go for the beer, not the food or service!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. The service was slow. Our fries never came. Avoid the scallop ceviche. It was absolutely swimming in a mayo dressing. According to the waitress this was 'standard' but I've never had ceviche so thoroughly drenched in sauce. The salmon pastrami was fine, but would've been nice to have known it would come covered in mustard (not indicated on the menu).

In all, subpar. The pub next door, Scotland Yard, has way better food and prices."}
{"text":"We had brunch on a Sat during one of our outings at a family wedding. The hostess seated us right away for a party of 10 at an outdoor patio. This is def the place for beer lovers. The menu breaks down the different types of ale, drafts, cider..you name it from different regions and countries. 
There are over 150 brands of bier from over 30 countries. I had the dry cider beer from England. It had a very crisp taste that went well with the brioche french toast that included sunny side eggs, grilled sausage, maple syrup, and compote du jour. Hub had the Swiss skillet- poached eggs, smoked kielbasa (sausage), Yukon potatoes, roast peppers and onions. He also had their cider but the sweeter and tarter version. The rest of our family had the Belgian waffles, strawberry shortcake, and a dish that contained pork, sausage, and sauerkraut in addition to various beers. 
I'm one of those ppl who hate waking early but loves breakfast. So naturally, brunch is one of the things I look forward to on a weekend. Bier is a nice place for that reason. Food was pretty good. And service was great. As for pricing, it's reasonable for the comfort and enjoyment of dining leisure."}
{"text":"Tasty food, excellent beer selection, wonderful service with a smile. We were happy without meal. Yes, it's pricy, but it was a nice evening of dining for these tourists. (although, the intentional misuse of German umlauts was a bit annoying)"}
{"text":"Service superb.  Had to try the local fare poutine with a local beer Steamwistle.  Was not disappointed."}
{"text":"I came for lunch it took forever to get my sandwich. I had to wait 20 minutes for that. Then i waites anoyther 10 minutes to get a desert menu and a coffee. Im not sure if i would go in there again. The waitress disnt pay atention half the time. This place needs improvements"}
{"text":"The hosts at the front door had no idea how long it would be for a wait and were too busy chatting amongst themselves to really entertain the idea to sit us. Once we were in however the good was great and the beer selection is unreal. 

We sat at the bar which over looked the appetizer chefs. Wow they are sure composed and made us feel confident of the level of professionalism that we would come to expect from the kitchen. 

Also had a good live band. If they figured out the hosting and had them actually do what is expected I would have given it a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Had a flight of beer and oysters. The former was great (shouldn't be surprising given the name of the place I guess) but the latter was just ok (but at a dollar per - thu night I think - I can't complain though more fixings than vinegar would have been nice). Some friends had burger which looked good and the fried calamari was interesting. Specifically, the calamari was cut in large, thick, fry-sized pieces and the batter was fried to bellow-crispy. I thought it was pretty good - though I prefer more standard preparations.

Side note: the resto has parking in the basement. Very convenient if driving into downtown."}
{"text":"Went hear for their \"Fondue Festivul\". I have been here several times before, mostly for drinks and sometimes the odd snack. This night was for dinner.

First, the food: Came here for a very specific purpose, which was Moules Frites (mussels and fries). There aren't many places in the city that offer this classic Belgian meal. You can't go wrong with this meal at Bier Market. We started off with fondue, which was good (how can you mess up melted cheese). It was a lot more quantity than expected - specifically lots of bread. For the entree - We ordered the \"A La Snob\" which is mussels in a creamy lobster sauce. As usually, excellent. The fries, however were kind of cold. Not so hot. A kilo of moules and frites is too much for two...especially if you get any apps

Drinks: Beer is the way to go here (go figure). They have a wide selection of beers on tap. I suggest going with something out of the ordinary - because chances are you won't find it easily elsewhere.

Service: This is where they fail. And this was not an isolated incident, the last time I was there very similar experience. First off, the waiter just reeks of smugness. He had a very condescending tone, which I didn't appreciate. We ordered our first beer - which was an Italian beer I hadn't tried before. He gave us an odd look - didn't think much of it at the time. After, we got our beers I noticed they seemed a little flat. I was curious if this was just the type of beer as some are less carbonated than others. I asked our waiter about it and he responded something like, \"did you see the look I gave you when you ordered that beer? it sucks\". Well then - tell us when we f****** ordered it instead of a \"I told you so after\". There was no value in saying this after the fact. I could go on about the issues I had with the service, but I will spare you the details. Bottom line is that this sort of thing went on all evening.

Overall though - food is surprisingly good for a bar that specialises in various beers. Menu is small however, but I figure what they do, they do good. Service sucks. Period."}
{"text":"Well there is an abundance of beer here (obvi) and the selection is really good. 

It's a good place to have dinner and then watch some live music. 

I'm a fan of the patio but it would be nice if the view wasn't of a parking lot. 

The crowd is also a good mix."}
{"text":"Great outgoing staff and good service. Large portions. The food is decent. Bacon poutine was a bit disappointing, but the onion rings were amazing. I would recommend this place if you're not in a hurry as it took about 40 minutes for food to come out."}
{"text":"If you want a plethora of beer choices and to watch whatever sports team tickles your fancy, this place is for you! However, if you want a burger and some good pountine, go somewhere else...

I came here with some coworkers one evening and sat at one of their tables inside as outside was full (awesome patio though)... I saw on the table that on ___day (can't remember what day of the week we went) they had a beer tasting. There were 6 shot glasses on some metal thing with a flier saying that that day you could try their seasonal beers. No time limit, no exceptions listed, just stated that on every ___day they would do this... I asked the server about it, she picked it up, looked at it and said, oh, that's only till like 5 or something, completely dismissive. I didn't appreciate that since again, it said nowhere on there that it was limited in any way. Oh well

We ordered some wings and poutine as an appetizer and some beers. The beers were all very good and when we finally got the wings, they were good too, artfully displayed, but not many of them. The poutine never came. Finally we got our meals, almost 45 minutes later. Two people got burgers and fries and I ordered the cheeseburger sliders. Honestly no one was very happy with their meal except the person who ordered wings. The burgers were overcooked and the buns were fairly tasteless.  We had to request the checks because the servers didn't come back to the table (it was not a crowded night either)... we saw that the poutine was in fact on our receipt. They took it off as soon as we told them that we didn't receive it however.

Honestly they had a huge beer menu. Go if you want to drink and watch a game but eat before you go!"}
{"text":"Overall, a decent venue. Beer selection is fantastic, food & service are average. Prices are a bit high. Good atmosphere/energy to be in before a hockey game.

We started with \"Poutine Tour\" which was tasty/fun, then had the Bouillabaisse and the Merchant (Wagyu Beef) Burger. The Bouillabaisse was missing some of the ingredients they had listed on the menu, though the flavour was good enough. The burger was served medium rare, which was pretty underdone for our taste, and we weren't advised that it would not be cooked through when we placed our order."}
{"text":"Still indifferent about this place. I love the selection of beer. However, the food I'm not sure about. I had the mussels and they were great. The portion of appetizers my friends ordered were not shareable at all. Very very small. The staff is friendly though and they have a decent amount of TVs so everyone can watch sports. If you want to go here to just drink beers, they have you covered."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night, it was busy but we got a table on the patio. The server was great, we got the red and the white sangria. I liked them both but my friend liked the white better. After we were done we went inside where the DJ was playing and danced. It was so fun, I'm glad this place is busy again, always one of my favourites on King West!!"}
{"text":"I have always loved the Bier Market, they always have a great beer selection and a great atmosphere; but I was greatly disappointed on my birthday! 
I phoned about two weeks prior to make a reservation as there was a group of 12. I talked to a girl on the phone who was very polite and made the reservation, she took all my information and said the reservation manager will give me an email the next day to confirm; she also mentioned that for winterlicious there is a 2hr limit per table because they are so busy... not a problem, completely understand! The next day... no email...never got an email, so a week later I phone the restaurant to confirm, the guy on the phone polite again looked into it, and said the reservation is all good, and that I will get a call 1-2 days prior to my reservation to confirm numbers.... again no call! I had to call myself the day of to confirm. 
Once we got there the table was ready for us. Our waitress seemed nice at first. We ordered drinks... they took about 30 minutes to come!!!! All we got was beer! Then we ordered off the winterlicious menu for the most part, some people ordered off the regular menu... long story short... 2hrs later, our waitress was just bringing out our mains! Considering we ordered as soon as we got there because we knew about the 2hr limit, waiting 2hrs for food seemed a little crazy.  
The food was ok overall, not great, but ok. One of the girl in the party got a burger with fries... how do you screw up a burger with fries! Both the burger and fries were stone cold, you could see the cheese on the burger came right out of the fridge! When we let the waitress know she took it back... got 2 feet from our table and rolled her eyes. At the end of the meal, they brought out a brownie for my birthday with a candle which was a lovely gesture but the brownie tasted 100% charcoal. It was completely inedible. 
Overall, we got there around 7:20 and left at almost 10:30! That's completely crazy to me when it was supposed to be a 2hr limit. 

To recap: great beer selection, cute place, nice atmosphere, horrible service, horrible slow, mediocre at best food! I wouldn't go back for anything more then a beer."}
{"text":"I've heard how popular Bier Markt was downtown so I decided to give it a try since I've never been. I'm not a beer person so I was more into trying their food. It was a nice sunny day so our group sat on the patio for a late lunch.

I ordered half a dozen of kusshi oysters and the Fruli strawberry wheat ale. The oysters are a bit expensive - $3 per oyster. One would assume getting a bunch of oysters would be cheaper but it's still the same price. Besides the price the oysters were fresh tasting and delicious! As I mentioned earlier I'm not a beer drinker but I did enjoy the Fruli strawberry beer. If you're not into beer try this drink the next time you're at Bier Markt. My boyfriend got several items: bavarian pretzels ($5), pastrami poutine ($7), and the markt wings ($13). I was lucky enough to try a little bit of everything :). I was able to try a few of his wings and there's nothing special or different about them. I would assume amazing wings for the price of $13. The pretzels and poutine were hot and fresh. 

Overall, it's a good place to hangout with friends and try all the types of beers they have. I wouldn't go here often as it is quite overpriced."}
{"text":"Great place to have a drink with friends with a pretty decent food menu to go along. I love their expansive selection of beer, as it gives the chance to try something unique (I had a pineapple wheat ale)!

It gets busy though / loud music later in the evenings, especially on weekends, so worth being ready for that. That said, we had a group of 14 and they accommodated us without a problem."}
{"text":"Ahh Bier Market! Great Bar/Lounge/Restaurant atmosphere. This place has a wide selection of Beer, so if that's what your into then don't hesitate to drop by. Make sure you arrive early because it gets really really busy. I gave it 3/5 because some of the staff were pretty uninformed and rude, our waiter was cool though. If you do decide to sit down and eat, make sure to grab their poutine, it's one of the best I ever had."}
{"text":"It's a chain place. You know...bar area, dining area, servers in tight short skirts.
After a hard weekend of work, I wanted a beer and some food.
The place was close to the hotel and it was busy! What do you expect for Saturday night in downtown Montreal.
Found a two person table for three people. Was tight but manageable. If you like beer (who doesn't? right?!?) this place is great for it. Dozens of worldly beer and local craft brews. Try the flights and choose an ale - worked for me.
Food was unremarkable...maybe that's why they are Bier Markt and not the Beer and Food Market.
I did mention that the table was tight - right? Well we needed some more space so I moved an empty plate to the empty table next to me. The hostess saw it, asked if it was my plate and put it back on the table and proceeded to lecture me on how they clear the tables. Wow! It would have been easier for her to just take 20 steps back to the kitchen. I was not impressed. I guess they do things differently here in La Belle Province.
Give me good old Toronto hospitality any day!"}
{"text":"Smaller than the main Bier Markt, but its still a good time.  The food is great, it's an interesting variety.  If you love cheese and seafood (my personal favs) you'll love their apps.  The beer selection is up there compared to other Toronto bars!"}
{"text":"Excellent ambience at the heart of Mississauga close to Square One. Went with my friend. We ordered the flight of six beers  ,recommendations were by the bartender. Along with that we ordered duck wings and onion rings which were sumptuous. I cant wait to be back for more as the drinks , food and ambience complemented one another so so well."}
{"text":"Not crazy about the food but trying new fun beers is an awesome experience. If you want something sweet and mixed try the Swedish Mojito. Comes with Swedish berries inside! So delicious :)"}
{"text":"Bier Markt is a well-established chain name, which unfortunately does not live to its fame.

What you will probably hear about it is that \"there are lots of beers from all around the world there, and the food is all German!\" What you will actually find is a number of Molson Canadian variations from different countries, and german-ish look-alike food of rather decent quality, but unimpressive portion size. And everything will be overpriced well beyond the actual value.

Is Bier Markt a bad place to go? No, it's not. Is it a wow place to go? Neither. Personally I consider it as an option to Jack Astors, without the associated noisy crowd (depends on your seating, bar would be bar). I won't go there on my own, but if there is a group of friends that feel like getting some beer without paying too much attention to the wallet - I won't hesitate."}
{"text":"Visited here on a Wednesday night and as soon as I came in, the hostess was friendly and greeted me. Good first impression. I was looking forward to trying the food as I am not much of a beer connoisseur.

My friend and I were able to be seated promptly. I ordered the pork schnitzel for the price of $24. Very pricey, but it was okay since I was not paying ;) the pork schnitzel was a very generous size and came with some sort of red berry sauce, which was a nice twist. On the side it came with green beans and emmental cheese spaztle (it didn't taste like cheese when I had it lol).

Our waitress was very knowledgeable with the food and beer menus. She did periodically check up on us at appropriate times.

Highly recommended if you're thinking of having a special night out, as it is a little heavy on the wallet."}
{"text":"Came here a couple times over the past few months for after movie snacks and drinks. .what can I say except it feels and tastes like chain restaurant food trying to be something it's not..too crowded, slow service- bruschetta was soggy and flavorless,  after that I had lost my appetite- great place for drinks, that's about it"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night to hang out with my cousins. We ordered 2 rounds of fresh oysters which was a special on that day for $1, a couple rounds of steins (approx 1 litre) of beers, a salad, fish and chips, sweet potato fries, calamari, and a charcuterie platter in which you choose 5 items for $28. We got cheese, sausage, mac and cheese, a mini poke bowl and baguette. 

Service was mediocre as it took them a very long time to bring out every single round of our beers. However, the waitress started to cater to us a bit more after realizing we were spending a lot of time and money. 

Overall food was delicious and we had an amazing time! The vibes and the location were great. Come here if you're willing to spend a good amount of money. It was worth it though!"}
{"text":"This is a classic pre-hockey game party spot. The beer selection was pretty impressive....I'd say 175 plus varieties from all over the world. The venue is quite large...a multi-floor facility, with plenty of TV monitors for sports viewing. I didn't eat here...but glanced at the menu....it was large with many pub favorites...ribs, burgers, putine, etc. 

Nice spot...right near the Bell Centre....

Solid 3 1/2 stars......."}
{"text":"With numerous locations across Toronto and this emergence of a craft beer following, I felt this visit was long overdue.  Nestled within the Shops of Don Mills, walking through this area on a Friday night is always lively, and fun.  
Decor is nice, and they have a nice patio, and everything looks the way it should for a proper upper class bier markt... I opted for the burger.. 

MERCHANT BURGER ~ 10 oz. Wagyu beef burger, chargrilled, smoked
bacon, charred red onion, vine-ripe tomato, iceberg lettuce, \"Bier 58\"
sauce, toasted classic bun, Markt frites ~ $25

Burger was good... we sampled numerous beers, although I am a little ashamed to say, I'm not sure which ones.  I always ask the employees for recommendations.  
The burger was a good solid burger, and the beef was high quality.  I asked for it medium rare (or as close as they can safely get to that).  It was a little overcooked, and slightly dry, but was still tasty.  It was a satisfying meal, BUT BUT BUT... for 25 dollars for a burger and fries, I expect a little closer to perfection.  So, slightly disappointing for me there.  

There is nothing wrong with this place... good selection of beers, normal service, food was okay.   I would stop in if in the area and looking for some good beers, but I would not travel into the city specifically for this location."}
{"text":"Great menu selection. Many options to choose from.
Live music on Saturday night created a great environment. 
The staff was polite and courteous.
Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"I can't think of a more perfect place to spend my St.Patty's day than a resto that boasts over 100 brands of beers from over 24 countries.

As expected there was a 30+ minute wait for a table tonight but while you wait you are more than welcome to enjoy a pint at the jam packed bar with the mass party goers. There was a live band playing that evening and music was blasting throughout the entire restaurant however they were quite good!

The beer menu is quite extensive, it gives descriptions, categorizes by flavour, and even lists calorie counts on a few too! I definitely knew exactly which one I wanted.

Fruli - Strawberry Belgian fruit beer, a unique blend of white beer and strawberry juice.
This was sooo delicious! For people who don't like beers or are more into fruity cocktails should definitely give this one a go! It's not sickeningly sweet but sweet enough that you wouldn't even think your drinking a beer.

The dinner menu itself is much more smaller and limited consisting mainly of German themed fare, shareables, and mains.

To start
Pretzels - Two giant freshly baked pretzels dusted in coarse sea salt served with a side of hot mustard.
These were hugeee but I thoroughly enjoyed it, fresh out of the oven hot, pillowy and soft with that crunchy coarse salt.

Mains 
Ahi Tuna Liegoise -seared med-rare, haricot verts, cararmelized onion, fingerling potatoes, smoked bacon, crisp capers, citrus buerre 
Tuna cooked perfectly , seared on the outside and rare on the inside, I loved every component of this dish they all tasted great together.

Atlantic Salmon - grilled salmon, leeks, asparagus & grape tomato saut√©, all-crust potato gratin, pea shoots, cider 
Salmon was a small portion but cooked well, very simple dish, the gratin was the real star.

Dessert
Peanut Butter Fondue - Belgian chocolate & peanut butter melange, bananas, strawberries, petits muffins, palmiers
Being a peanut butter lover this was a no brainer however taste wise it was not what I expected. The fondue wasn't silky smooth at all, it seemed like the peanut butter didn't mix smoothly into the chocolate and by the end it had separated and took on a curdled like texture with a layer of oil on the top. 

Despite how packed this place was service was still prompt and friendly and food came out quick and hot. However I'd say this place is much more suited to hang out with a large group or sample a few pints of beer and chill out with some live music.."}
