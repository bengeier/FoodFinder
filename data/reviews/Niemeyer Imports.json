{"text":"Great cheeses, deli, croquette, imported goods from the Netherlands. They have a little cafe area for a quick lunch, serving soups and sandwiches"}
{"text":"Accordion music playing in the background is easy-listening. Indonesian Sambal Badjak and other products brought me here. I poured myself a cup of coffee, sat at a table and read the news.  The Owners, Staff and even the Customers are so easygoing. Section of Imported perishable[1] Grocery, half Indonesian half Dutch. Deli/Lunch counter and Dutch Souvenirs complete the small shop. As I drink and read, the owner was making a special order Gift Basket.  By the time my Friend decided to appear, I already had Verkade bar ready. Late afternoon, so Pickled HERRING Lunch will have to wait for next time. Stroopwafel will do for now, as we pick a pack from the counter to share.  [1] as with most Import perishables, *watch* for expiry date."}
{"text":"Being a recent Indonesian-American transplant to Toronto, I was terribly disappointed to learn that the GTA lacks a proper Indonesian restaurant. Furthermore, the local Asian markets don't seem to carry many of pre-packaged Indonesian spices with which to make some of the favorite dishes at home.   This is where Niemeyer Imports comes in. Not only do they have these spices and other pantry items, they carry many Dutch goodies that I grew up with and love -- such as muisjes and hagel (sugar sprinkles that are eaten on toast for breakfast), speculaas (spiced sugar cookies), ontbijtkoek (a breakfast cake, soooo good slathered with Dutch butter!), stroopwafel (syrup waffles)... the list goes on. Seriously, it's hard not to explore the shelves and not want to bring home one of everything!   Most of the shop is taken up by a deli/coffee shop where they serve up Dutch specialties (kroket, sausage rolls, gouda, etc); however, on my visit there I didn't get to stick around long enough to sample. I definitely will make a special trip out there to do so, though.   The people that work there are super super nice and very helpful. I'm so happy this place exists -- I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place only once, a couple of years ago. I lived in Barrie and frequented The Dutch store there (flagship to Niemeyer's)  I have moved south and was planning a trip to Niemeyer's, I was shocked to find out that the website said that they have closed down.  This was a great store, I was looking forward to a Broodje krokette. I did find a picture of a note on the Internet. It stated that they might reopen. I hope this will happen soon, there is nothing resembling this store in the GTA. Very sad to see this store gone"}
{"text":"I specifically came here looking for imported stroopwafels from Holland. I was so sorely disappointed when I found out that they only carry stroopwafels made in Ontario, like the kind you could find at food basics. These don't taste like the real thing....and staff doesn't seem to understand the difference. The ones from Holland taste soo much better - buttery and sweet. The Ontario ones taste like cardboard... something lacking in their recipe. The lady at the register was kind and offered me a complimentary chocolate."}
{"text":"I've been to the strip plaza where Niemeyer Imports located numerous of time.. So when my Yelp Friend said meet there it is where Kim Tao Hot Pot , Bali Restaurant located.. I know exactly where it is!  Warm welcome from the storeowner when I walked in.... Niemeyer does set up like a little charming coffee shop with quite a few tables. My Yelp Friend had made himself at home, reading newspapers and drinking coffee...  Great selections of Dutch imports... of course my eyes and heart always set on the sweets...  Stroopwafel* (syrup waffles) went well with the drip coffee, what a leisure way to chill out and enjoy the moment.. or the sweetness!  Have to come back for lunch later since Niemeyer Imports has LUNCH SPECIALS! And I also have a coupon for a free drink if I get a lunch specials....  *http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroopwafel"}
