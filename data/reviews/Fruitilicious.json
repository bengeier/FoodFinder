{"text":"This place is soooo good! They really have the best Mexican treats in the east valley!!! The people are always so nice too!!!"}
{"text":"BEST PLACE FOR MEXICAN TREATS I AM NOT JOKING!!! I have traveled throughout Arizona always looking for places like these and the only ones hat are worth your time are them and Chayo's in Phoenix. I would have to say that Fruitilicious is better though. Their elote (corn in a cup) is by far the best I've tried and their mangoneadas are also amazing. Even my boyfriend who is not a fan of Mexican food loves coming here. We probably come every week because we jus can't get enough. If I could give more than five stars I honestly would."}
