{"text":"As a gay male walking into this restaurant I must say I was very pleased. The sexiest young man took my order. I asked him what he preferred and he said the blt, but I said I want whatever has the most \"meat\". He suggested the steak and cheese. I trusted this young man who I quickly fell in love with and order the suggested sandwich. The food was 10/10 and service was 10/10. Id prefer to anyone looking to eat a great sandwich or see a cute young stud for a cashier."}
{"text":"I ordered the Steak and cheese sandwich.. Well I got a steak and cheese sandwich with plenty of onions and peppers but what the sandwich lacked was seasoning for the meat.. the meat was bland no flavor what so ever, I'm glad the peppers and onions had some flavor or I would have asked for my money back. Servce was great and the place was clean. I would probably think twice about going back for the Steak and Cheese Sandwich!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been going here for 10 years. Their toasted subs are the best. It's a hole in the wall type place. It's not pretty but I don't care! The toasted turkey sub is amazing. And they have styrofoam cups and crushed ice. Yummmmmy."}
{"text":"\"No other place like it!! Have tried everything on the menu (except 3 cheese) and have not been disappointed!! Hot Pastrami is the best!!\""}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the service here as well as the submarine sandwich.  It is nice to get away from Subway and Cheba Hut, which are my staples when dining for subs.  My only beef is that the majority of the time I go here, there are bums hanging out at the nearby westbound Broadway bus stop, more likely than not asking for money.  What can I expect from Hardy and Broadway though?  Overall the dining experience is pleasant.  I'd recommend Sub Factory for a lunch break from work."}
{"text":"I decided to grab a sandwich to take back to my office after running some errands in the Colonnade shopping center, since I parked near the Sub Factory, I figured it was worth a try.  The inside is quaint and not very fancy, but they have a huge menu!  They have hot subs, cold subs, croissant sandwiches, wraps and paninis.  I decided to get the Mesquite Smoked Turkey special, which was turkey, bacon, provolone, lettuce, tomato, mayo and Santa Fee sauce served hot.  My sandwich was ready in a flash and still hot by the time I got back to my office.

I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty this was.  The bread was crusty on the outside, but soft on the inside, and the Santa Fe sauce really made it delicious.  They had lots of other good looking sandwiches, so now that I work in the area, I am sure that I will be back when Subway just won't cut it!"}
{"text":"Great Subs, really fresh bread, nice portions and good price.  I visit at least once or twice month."}
{"text":"This place is very delicious.... Super friendly people behind the counter and they give you a green card- when you get 8 sandwiches the next one is one the house.  The chicken wrap served warm is my favorite.  I really suggest just getting off the 101 and University on the way to work and grabbing a quick HEALTHY sandwich.!!!"}
{"text":"Judging from the other reviews it's best to find that one item and stick to it. 

Today was my second visit, and I ventured off to have the pesto chicken wrap and chicken salad. Sadly, they both were not good.

I'll pass on the Sub Factory next time."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to come here.

Granted I only order my favorite sub (the club), every sandwich I ever ate here had something called consistency.  Besides the great taste and awesome prices, I'm glad that for once, a small shop can keep making sandwiches correctly and accurately as possible.  

Nothing special about this place.  It's not a fancy store or a huge corporate chain so I'm not expecting some 5 Star quality ingredients.  However, for what it is (a quick lunch or supper) they offer excellent service and a quality meal."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying...I looooooove a good pastrami sandwich.  So when a friend suggested of mine said he was going to make a lunch run down there, I checked out their menu and right away told him to bring me back a pastrami.  I must say...I made a excellent choice.  The sandwich was very good.  Plenty of pastrami and cheese.  The pickle spear was a unexpected and pleasant surprise.   So in closing, this review is completely based on just the sandwich, I haven't been inside the shop yet...but when I do get there...I'll update."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop.  Pastrami deluxe is my favorite."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sandwich in town. .friendly..fast clean...reasonable prices...I'll be back...!........... ................ ........... .............. ....... ........ ............. www.AirSlamit..com"}
{"text":"I  have been coming to this particular location since I was in high school and I graduated in 1994.  I was craving it bad today and when I opened my sandwich I was disappointed.  I was even more disappointed when I took my first bite.  THEY CHANGED THE BREAD!!!  I loved the bread before and now sandwiches are served on a cheap store bought roll.  Should have just gone to Subway or Bite Me Subs in the same area."}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant.  This place is in need of a makeover. The restrooms were filthy too, not a good sign. With all of the new competition in the area though it won't be long till this is a vacant storefront."}
{"text":"Sub Standard is more like it. 

Had a sub here today - the bread tasted funny and the grilled chicken tasted blander than construction paper and was more rubbery than the end of a No. 2 pencil. 

Without mayo and cheese, my sandwich consisted of bread, chicken, lettuce, and tomatoes. That's it. They don't ask if you want all the fixin's. For the grilled chicken sandwich, those ARE the set fixins.

For $6.50 I expected a lot more. Nice service, but that's pretty much it.

At least Miracle Mile and Duck & Decanter are close by.

2 stars."}
{"text":"Lots of food options available to include wraps & salads. Friendly service & inexpensive. Great place for a quick bite. Two stars off for being dated but one star back on for being very clean."}
{"text":"Prices are very inexpensive, but that just leads to inferior food quality usually. Jenni-O turkey is clearly not Boars Head and the sub rolls are pretty much the generic rolls that come ten to a package in your local grocery store (the ones that are already pre-sliced and taste like hot dog buns. Also, there was an older guy who had a gray splotch, that was making my sandwich, and he just seemed out of place and also must have dumped a jar of mayo on my Chicken Breast sub. It's one of those places that doesn't really care about presentation or quality ingredients. Turn and burn sub shops are my definition of these joints. Much better subs just up Broadway at Bite Me. College kids and cops eat at Sub factory and that is just what it is - a factory of bad meats and people who don't care about your lunch - just their profit."}
{"text":"Food is good, a bit too pricey though. Finding the door was a bit of a challenge but there are signs to help with that."}
{"text":"Two thumbs down!

This was my first time trying \"sub factory\" since I recently moved into the nieghborhood and this was the only place for subs that didn't appear to be a \"chain\" sub shop. I ordered the \"meatball\" sub with the normal toppings, onion, peppers, cheese. 
When I brought the sub home I was really excited to try it, then the dissapointment came. The bread was just ok it didn't look baked fresh, it seemed to be a kind of roll you buy at your local market that was split in half, not actual sub roll. The meatballs were sitting in what appeared to be canned crushed tomatoes, no seasoning nothing, it was pretty gross, no real italian marinara, then it had sliced onion, which was not cooked, then whatever cheese that seemed to be on it was only on the side of the sub. The meatballs tasted like the frozen kind you buy at the store and tasted like they where rehydrated and soaked in water, they were dry, bland and just plain gross.
 After only a couple of bites I was grossed out by the whole thing,  I turned and gave it to my dog.  

Sub Factory was a total waste of my money and time.

Note: 
When you own a little independant food chain , you are supposed to \"kick butt\" and go the extra mile with your food, and your customers.  I wasn't satisfied or impressed as a customer,

 I will NOT be back, not even for free food, it's that gross........."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sub Factory for years...Terry and his staff are top notch... ham and turkey deluxe.. roast beef deluxe and the Club are my favorites here... won't be disappointed guaranteed"}
{"text":"better than a subway, but a little on the expensive side for what i get, i think.

i like to order the turkey and avocado croissant, with chips and a drink, ends up being almost $8. if you eat at the rest. it's a little dingy for my taste. i usually just pick and take back to work. 

the ingredients seem relatively fresh, but i would prob never eat here if this particular location wasn't directly across the street from my office."}
{"text":"Had  their  pastrami sandwich.  There was plenty  of meat on a toasted  bun . I could  not finish  the sandwich.  I had them leave the mustard  off . Staff was friendly.  Good value"}
{"text":"Love this place, iv lived behind the sub factory for the past 4 years and more recently started going.. And now it's a 1-2 visits a week. Hot Pastrami! Roast beef melt.. Both amazing (something about the lightly toasted bread) and the hot italian. Please for your sake try this place and enjoy."}
{"text":"If you blink you might miss this sandwich place.  Went here to try something close to my new office and walking in it looked rather busy.  Service here was on top of their game getting people in and out ASAP!  This the perfect place for a quick lunch on the go.  They also have seating here but I wouldn't count on finding a seat during lunchtime.  

I customized my sandwich from one of the menu generics on the board and they got it right with no trouble at all.  Got the feeling they would make any sandwich I asked for which is the best kind of place to frequent.  Rest assured I will be going back for more.  Only reason this is not a 5 star is because of the location.  Hard to find and if you did see it you most likely say to yourself, \"let's go somewhere else.\""}
{"text":"I flipping love sub factory. I used to eat these subs every day and tonight I found their frequent punch card in my wallet. I've had it since high school. I totally plan on eating these subs again, I forgot all about it! 

My order: 
Turkey on white with onions and banana peppers and provolone. sometimes lettuce. 

The turkey is shaved very thin and it's piled on! the bread is so chewy and perfect. 

The onions are sliced very very thin as well and it makes them so easy to eat! 

Seriously, I LOVE sub factory. Definitely get an otis cookie while you're there, too. 

I always see cops and business men whenever I go in, the space is small but clean with quite a bit of sitting space."}
{"text":"First, this is my favorites Sub Factory location. It's the only one with the seafood sub. As a whole I'm not a huge fan of the chain, the food is low quality, bland, and unoriginal."}
{"text":"if you are sick of quizznos, subway or any other sandwich chain place i would check this place out... there sandwiches are very good and different than what you will find at the other places... i always get the hot ham and cheese (it also has sprouts and mushrooms on it)... one of my friend swears by the chicken parm sandwich but i have not tried it yet... but if it is a late night tonight, you know i will be hitting it up tomorrow..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the food is always fresh and tasty, the service is friendly, and the facility is clean. I love the seafood and avocado sub! This place uses fresh avocado which is hard to find, sprouts, lettuce, and tomatoes, and the bread isn't too hard or too soft. They are quick and I don't mean careless quick I mean down to business quick. It can get busy during the lunch rush but still not too long of a wait. I highly recommend anyone who hasn't been here to come!"}
{"text":"Two thumbs up! I downloaded the yelp app in order to write this review. I have driven by the place hundreds of times but I finally stopped in today and it rocked! The staff was friendly and real. The food was Yummy with a capitol Y. I will definitely be returning for future lunches :)"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for 7 years. It has always been one of my favorite places. I recently got a sandwich with the \"new crew\" the sandwich didn't taste the same. Not as much mayo mustard or oil and vinegar that the sandwich has had for the last 7 years. Also the bread was noticeably stale.  I'm assuming it wasn't fresh. I'm really bummed! I hope they can somehow fix it before they close."}
{"text":"I had the 6 inch spicy Italian today. This sandwich was much better than the Subway one. My daughter had the Italian chicken panini that she said compared favorably to one she had at Postino a few days ago. A nice lunch worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Food: Turkey croissant sandwich with lettuce, mushrooms, sprouts, and red onions. The sandwich was pretty big and filling. The croissant was room temp. I would have liked it better if it was toasted. 4/5

Service: I came here at lunch time and it was pretty packed but I was able to get my food quickly. The girl who took my order was friendly. Sandwich + bottled water came out to a little under $10. 3/5

Final thoughts: I would come back, there's plenty to choose from on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great food and service . Ordered a large cold sub and was ready before I sat down. Now that's fast!"}
{"text":"I've seriously been coming to this place for 10 YEARS!  The name says it all - and don't come here looking for anything else.  It's not fancy or pretentious, just a great place to stop in and grab a sub.

My favorite is the toasted turkey - no frills, just a turkey sub with tomatoes, lettuce and mayo - and don't forget the provolone cheese.  For $7 with chips and a drink you can't go wrong here.  

Sub Factory can get a little busy during the week for the lunch crowd, so call in before or come a little after normal lunch hours and you won't wait more than a few minutes."}
{"text":"not a bad place for subs.  The valley misses out on good subs and this place for the valley is miles above average, but if you have had great subs like a Jersey Mikes you know this place is just average.

Help is real friendly and the price is good.  The Mother sub is usually what I get.  If you are in the area and in the mood for a sandwich this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for a sub and didn't want to visit the ubiquitous Subway.  I racked my brain trying to think of any non-chain sub shop between East Mesa and South Scottsdale.  Luckily, I remembered the Sub Factory.

If you've never been to this location before, the entrance is a bit peculiar.  From University the shop is obvious with it's two-story window and neon sign.  But the entrance isn't on the University side.  Walk towards the tattoo shop and the door is actually under the staircase and behind you.

The menu is fairly simple, as is the atmosphere.  While I was waiting for my sub, I noticed that they also have beer and happy hour specials.  I don't know if people make this a regular hang-out for libations, but if I came her in the evening, I would definitely appreciate the option.

The subs are good in a way that I can appreciate being from the East Coast.  The bread is flaky on  the outside and fluffy on the inside.  Then they bake it to give it that little extra crisp. The bread actually looked quite mangled when I got it, but the taste was awesome.  I find Subway bread to be too rubbery and chewy.

The toppings are simple and tasty. Except for the tuna, but I blame that on the fact that I haven't had tuna in 20 years.  I won't hold it against the Sub Factory, but I will definitely stick with the other sub options from now on."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are pretty good, I believe I had the Ham & Swiss on my last trip there. The food portions are bigger than I can eat and the sandwiches are nice and melty. The shop itself is small- order at the counter and they'll call out when your order is ready.

SubFactory isn't my favorite sandwich shop, and I probably wouldn't ever pick this place to eat, but I wouldnt be opposed to going if someone else wanted to."}
{"text":"First time here.  They offer a sub for $2.95!  It includes ham, genoa, cotto, provolone, mustard, mayo, onion, lettuce, tomato, oil, vinegar and obviously a sub roll!  It was actually pretty good and filling.  Add a side of macaroni or potato salad for 99 cents.  

They offer about 20 subs in all."}
{"text":"Ive always gone to the original location and quite frankly forgot this one was here. Its at the end of a strip just west of Hardy on Broadway.

I went around lunch time and it was fairly busy. But the line moved quickly, I think I was in and out in maybe 10 minutes. I love how unassuming Sub Factory is. You walk in and see the look of a very simple, maybe not so so clean little dining area w/ an average counter and kinda think \"Well this probably wont be the *best* sandwich Ive ever had...\". But youre wrong, well maybe not totally wrong. Its not gonna be the best but its gonna be damn good. I love the turkey croissant sandwich, and just like the original location, its delicious.

I was more surprised at my wait time than the quality of the food. Its Sub Factory, its always gonna be good.

This is definitely a hidden lunch gem."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Sub Factory for years now and it's always delivered a great sub... But I have only ordered one each time the Pastrami Deluxe (melted cheese, fried bell peppers, grilled onions, mushrooms, mustard, pickle... Wow this is one great sub a must try for anyone looking for a great sub."}
{"text":"I eat lots of sub sandwiches but I usually opt for the more famous chain which will remain nameless but it starts with Sub and ends it Way (and the word is subway) which happens to be about a block down the street. 

How foolish of me to go to a chain when Sub Factory is right in my neighborhood. 

The subs are 10'' on white or wheat with a large selection, most subs starting at only 4.89! That's a good deal! I had the steak and cheese which was loaded with peppers, grilled onions and lots of meat. 

Pictures of \"old\" Tempe (i.e. probably from the 80s and 90s) hung on the wall. There are a few ways to my heart and an appreciation of local history is one of them. So are good sub sandwiches. I'm now in love with Sub Factory and I'm going to go there a lot more. 

The girl working was very nice and genuinely smiled and thanked me when I left. 

So this is a major win and a great new discovery for me."}
{"text":"Great sub. Reminds me of an old school grinder. Very good!"}
{"text":"Best salad for the price bar none!! Service is always friendly and they remember my name  and what I want!! Always stop in when I can. Oh and they play the National Anthem at noon every day! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped here with a friend after class one day. It was on the edge of being a little sketchy, but the two guys (owners?) there were super nice. I got the turkey and swiss and ny friend got the special which was a turkey bacon whatever melt. Both pretty good and the bread was bomb. Might be a \"on the way home\" stop in the future"}
{"text":"Vegetarian sub was fresh and full of flavor."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sub Factory for years and years and its by far the best sub shop in arizona. Terry the owner is the Best Business owner ever and the employees there are  Great they get to know you and know what you order. They area all extremely nice. I recommend you try this location off broadway and hardy you will not be disappointed..."}
{"text":"Always great service and the subs are the best in town. Forget those other places who don't know how to give you a sandwich with TOPPINGS. The bread is fresh and always tastes great."}
{"text":"I came here over the holiday weekend for a sub.  I wanted to check this place out, and see what its all about. It looked cool as heck from the outside...possibly a former McDonalds??  2 stories, with a big window front!

Anyways, I cruised in, and studied the menu.  I ended up getting a hot pastrami sub, which was delicious by the way.  I think it was about 8 inches long, and the prices were fair and reasonable!  Hooray for a good deal!  The place was quiet when I was there.  There was only 1 customer eating alone, and myself.  They also have happy hour specials here with a few beers to go with your subs n stuff.  Pretty neat!

I think the subs here are decent, but the place really needs a facelift."}
{"text":"This place is located in a big strip mall where I used to work. I've seen it a million times and never bothered to stop in.  I had to stop by my old job (that I just got laid off from on Monday) and was absolutely starving. 

I came in here because I had a few bucks in my pocket, and had to eat something.  I was starving!  So, I cruise in here, and think, how bad can it be?  well, it sucked!

At first impressions, the place seemed okay.  Big menu, decent pricing, etc.  W ell, that's about the excitement of it.  For starters, I stood at the counter staring at this guy who was making a sub.  I don't think he said anything, but just kind of stood there and threw a sub in this little convection oven.  After a few minutes, a lady came out.  The guy started talking to me, but the lady cut him off and then took my order.

I ordered the BBQ beef sandwich.  They come in 2 sizes, a small and a 6 inch. I just wanted a small since I needed to get something in my system after a day of job hunting and dealing with my previous employer.  It was ready in no time flat, and man, it looked SMALL.  And ugly! all in one!  It was roast beef that they threw in the convection oven and doused in BBQ sauce! The meat itself wasn't so bad, but the high amount of bbq sauce made it hard to eat. 

Then, I go to refill my drink.  Um, they said it was a $1.00 for refills for smalls, and more for medium and larges.  Um, NO.  FAIL.  Don't charge me for a fountain pop refill. NO NO NO.  I refilled it and sat my happy ass back down.

Food was not good, and I'm probably not going back any time soon. UGH!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich .. I usually go to subways but thought let me try this place due to busy schedule and loved it. Will be coming back for more
Try the pastrami sandwich better than anything out there and great price too"}
{"text":"This sub shop is awesome! Friendly staff also. I love the lay out of this place too. You can eat down stairs or upstairs. Clever."}
{"text":"Pretty lame subs and sandwiches. Worked close by so tried a few times. Hate to say it, but Subway is much better. Quality and quantity of ingredients in the so so bread left a lot to be desired.

Service was okay but nothing to Yelp positively about."}
{"text":"This is a small business where you get a good sandwich for a good price. The quality of the meat leaves something to be desired, but overall for a quick bite for cheap it is a good alternative to subway. These are sandwiches you can make yourself, but don't because your lazy. The owner is a good guy who offered to wrap our leftovers for us, so they get bumped up to 4 stars for that. Go here if you want subway but not subway."}
{"text":"Sub Factory is one of the better sub shops in Tempe - They have been around forever and have a reputation of using the highest quality, freshest ingredients. They may need to give this location a \"make-over\" soon though... it's getting a little tired. (FYI - their secret weapon is their bread)"}
{"text":"While I prefer the two story Tempe location on the 101 & University , this is not at all bad. The quality of the ingredients that they use is obvious with the first bite. While the employees at this location aren't very professional, it's very hard to beat their subs."}
{"text":"Not so clean, both the facility and the workers.  This place has been here forever and they do make a good toasted sub.  They should, they were doing it long before toasting was an option at most chain sub shops.

If you can get past the cleanliness, the food is not bad...although I do wonder about the hygiene practices in the back where they make the subs."}
{"text":"Started out on the 7th Ave & Camelback location and loved their subs,, now, its been a few years, maybe a decade or so,, but,, Now in the Tempe area and came across this place on broadway.. 

Ham n Cheese Deluxe is off the hook... I peeve, is canned mushrooms,,, but the sprouts n everything else in this thing is awesome,, another once a week stop now until,, i relocate my workplace :D"}
{"text":"Don't like giving bad reviews but had to for this place and frankly I don't know how this place has any positive reviews.  Like another reviewer pointed out, the quality of the turkey and rolls is extremely low.  Pre-sliced buns at a sub shop, are you serious?  Turkey was gray and mushy, I picked it off after one bite (I ordered the turkey and roast beef).  You know how sometimes after eating a really good meal you feel really good?  Well this place made me feel the opposite.  Even if Sub Factory was dirt cheap I couldn't recommend it;  I paid about $8.50 for sandwich, chips and a soda.

If you want a good sandwich you shouldn't come here.  Subway is better, honestly."}
{"text":"this place is great for a change from the larger sub chain places. I usually get the same sub each time and its always excellent and doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff.  Cheap, no frills, etc.  Good quick bite for lunch, but probably not the place to go if you're trying to impress someone."}
{"text":"Came here to try something new.  I'm not coming back.

Let's back up a bit.  The sub is decent, a shade higher than subway quality, but that shade might need to be measured by NASA.  Had a hot sub, was heated up in a microwave.  I can do that at home cheaper and without cooking it to the consistency of beef jerky.

Here is what started to get me... I paid for the combo meal, which is 2 dollars and something for a fun size bag of chips and a drink.  Fountain drink stand has dust on it, bad sign.  What does that take that wipe down?  5, maybe 10 seconds? I get a fork at the straw/lid/silverware station afterwards.  4 crumbled up straw wrappers in the silverware station, on top of the forks.  I elect to eat without a fork.

Did the guy who just walked out of the john wash his hands before he took off his straw wrapper with his genital holding hands and throw it in the fork tray?  I have no idea...

Sanitation on that situation = 0.  Guy working in the back was rocking out to the radio.  Confirmed that when I washed my hands after eating and saw him in the kitchen with the door wide open to said work station.  I think checking that area is low on the list of priorities, as evidence would suggest.

Here is what really pisses me off.  My chips taste terrible.  Not crunchy at all.  Came in on 12/18/2012, chips expired on 12/4/1012.  These are nacho cheese Doritos.  Sure, probably somewhat safe to eat a year after that but taste like shit.  My concern is if no one is looking at the expiration date on the chips, are they looking at it on the microwaved meat I just ate?  Or the cold meat they serve?  

Bottom line, I don't like eating anywhere that openly advertises they sell expired food.  The chips proved that to me.  Really wish I would have seen that before I ate a few chips before seeing the expiration date and threw the rest of them away in the garbage which is what this place should have done before selling them.    Plenty of other sub shops very close to here I would assume do not do that, I'll give them my cash instead.  You have now been dubbed \"Sub Craptory,\" until you get your act together.  Sure, I could have told someone that works there I bought expired food, but I already have a job.  I don't need to do yours.  I'm just never coming back again.

Expired food = automatic one star.  Congratulations.

I don't know, we are only 2 days away from 12/21/2012, maybe this is what the Mayan's predicted, people would eat your expired food here and all die of food poisoning and that is what ends the world.  I hope not.  That would suck."}
