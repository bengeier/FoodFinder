{"text":"Friends took us to Maria Tina for my birthday and it was not only some of the very best Italian food in the GTA with best calamari and veal Marsala but the ambiance was perfect for dinner.  Service exceptional.  We will be back here many times to come."}
{"text":"\"A hidden gem\" I have visited this restaurant on several occasions and even gone as far as having events catered by them.  Fabulous food, reasonable pricing and fantastic service. The owners Orsela and Vince are by far the best to deal with.  Always trying to please and offering advice on event meal planning. I highly suggest trying them out or booking an event or even catering.  10/10 love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place three or four times. Food is great here. The gnocchi is to die for--my favourite. The salad is very good as well. The only problem is that the service is quite slow, so I would not go if you need to be anywhere else is two hours or less."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, great tasting food! I've eaten there on 2 separate occasions, first with a group of 6 and then again with 10.  Both times, there was nothing but praise and accolades for how good the food tasted!  Well worth it. Will definitely be returning a third time!"}
{"text":"By far the best Carbonara I have ever had! I didn't know what to expect when I stopped in for lunch, but white linens and real glasses on the table weren't part of the vision. I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara lunch special, at $19 it's definitely on the spendy side, but wow is it ever good!

Loaded with flavorful bacon, lots of garlic, and perfectly al dente spaghetti, it was gone in seconds. After that, I use the bread course to wipe up every last trace of the sauce in the bowl.

There were other interesting specials, includong a tenderloin with 2 jumbo shrimp. I almost commandeered that one as it passed my table. 

Really, this place was a surprise and I can see this moving to the top of my list for Italian food."}
{"text":"Come to this place if you want a proper Italian pasta, with excellent service. I usually get the braised veal fettuccini, or the daily specials. Every other pasta I have tried here tastes fantastic!!"}
{"text":"this restaurant is fabulous. Food is sooo authentic, tastes homemade.
