{"text":"Came here with a group of friends so we tried a variety of items. We were disappointed with the quality of the dessert and the service.  Most likely won't come again.  Dessert: Ordered mango coconut with sago and mango chewy. Mango coconut with sago drink was very misleading. In the drink, we had so little mango that we could barely see it. It was all coconut and sago.   Mango chewy dessert had lots of fesh mango pieces inside which is good but the mango ice cream texture was very crumbly and lacking in flavour. The mango puree was okay but not much flavour, just cold. The white chewy pieces had no flavour but the texture was okay. Overall, nothing wowed me bout his dessert.   Atmosphere: It's located inside a hot pot restaurant so it was a bit strange to eat dessert at tables with induction plates and a savoury aroma.   Service: I didn't feel welcome. No one offered us water and when we asked for it, they didn't even bring enough cups for everyone. Also, when we tried to order, they kept leaving to grab paper/do other stuff even though our group was ready. After we ordered, we had to wait a long time for the desserts. It was so slow that some people didn't even get their order by the time the others finished and wanted to leave. Also, some of the waitresses gave us attitude when we ordered or asked for separate bills. Overall, they were very disorganized and didn't make us feel like valued customers."}
{"text":"A disappointment after the hype of the well-known brand. This location is nestled inside Simmer Huang. There is no special seating for the dessert, and the place smells like curry and hot pot. The menu advertises all kinds of mango-based desserts in cup and bowl format. I feel it's overpriced considering mango is really not in season.   Came in large group and the servers took a long time to get all our orders. Furthermore the orders all came out a separate times on different ends of the table. Servers aren't knowledgeable of their product and didn't try to serve the drinks to the right customer.  Ordered a mango pomelo drink. There's decent amount of mango, but sad few little pieces of pomelo. The mango ice cream looks more like a sorbet and it's a weird light yellow colour. The sago had a bit of undercooked pieces probably due to the large amount of orders.  Considering this location is relatively new, it's understandable that they still need to get their act together. But for the price I'm paying, I'd rather go pick up some bubble tea in the multitude of selection in Commerce Gate rather than waiting for subpar mango desserts."}
{"text":"I love their mango drinks. They are really made with real mangoes. They are sweet and delicious. But I don't like the way that I am informed after I have placed my order that there's about 20 minutes wait for my  drink. If I knew that it would take that long to wait for my drink , I would have moved to another restaurant.   In addition, different waitresses came several times to take the complete order at my table. The regular size of a drink is not much a difference from the large size, and the large size is not much a difference from a jumbo size. The $1 additional charge to upgrade for a bigger size is a bit speechless  to me. $$$$$"}
{"text":"This place used to be a must-go every time I visited Hong Kong for vacation. Despite their quality dropping over the years in Hong Kong, I still extremely excited when I heard that they were planning to open one in Toronto!   I waited for the hype to be over to avoid the lineups. The location - as mentioned by many others - is a bit weird, as it was located within another Chinese restaurant without their own designated seating. The restaurant itself specializes in simmering hot pots with strong flavoured sauces, and therefore did not match the theme of a dessert place as much, and people often complain that they'd smell like hotpot when they leave the restaurant. However, that did not bother me that much as I was just planning to get a drink to-go anyways.   They didn't have my favourite drink from Hong Kong, but the worker allowed me to add the chewy mochi balls inside the drink as an extra topping. However, they were too large in size for me to be able to eat with a straw. I don't think I expected that much, since most restaurants coming overseas usually are a bit different / not as good as the original. The mangoes weren't the freshest, but overall, I don't think my drink was bad. If I do crave mango desserts in the future, I think I'd still give this place another try and actually sit down this time."}
{"text":"Ok really weird location... I don't really enjoy going for some dessert but coming out smelling like hot pot!   I guess if your getting take out it's ok.  The dessert are same menu as Hong Kong's Hui Lau Shan, but not as good quality. The drinks you should just pass on it.   The waiters don't really speak good English, was hard to communicate and order even for just dessert.  And when you walk in they ask you if your there for hot pot or dessert, I wonder if there is a choice to have both?   I'm glad they opened up a franchise here but was a bit disappointed in the quality."}
{"text":"TL; DR - Terrible. Never will return, even if they got their act together, which I'm skeptical about.  Negative stars if yelp allows.  -------  Came here for dessert.... what were we thinking?!?!  2 restaurants sharing 1 space. Am I here for hot pot or dessert? I'm not sure.   Environment: Nice interior. Dessert restaurant shares the same space as the hot pot restaurant. I'm seated at a hot pot table with a hot pot menu and dessert menu. What exactly am I having again?  I much prefer enjoying desserts in a more laid back environment. The atmosphere could serve as a decent dessert place if they got rid of all the hot pot stuff. Also do not want to smell hot pot or leave smelling like hot pot after having just dessert. 0.5/5 stars (they get 1/2 a star here because of the interior).   Food: Since mango was all over their menu, and really the only thing on their menu, it better be some damn good mangoes. Our large group ordered various desserts and all ended up being on various levels of bad. My order was mango and coconut with red bean. Mango - very little. Coconut - there but didn't care for. Red bean - out of a freezer. That's how hard they were. Ice?! I don't even know what to say because I'm not sure whether my drink should contain ice or not.. I didn't get ice cubes, but the ice I got also wasn't blended fully. Pretty bad job there. 1/5 stars only cuz the mango part tasted alright.   Menu: It screams mango and that's it. If there were no picture of cups or bowl, every item sounds exactly the same. Not a good menu.   Service: Slow. Very slow. Non existent. We had a group of 10+ people. Waitress came to take orders for 4 people and ran away. 15min later, a different waitress came by to take orders but was all over the place. Asked for water and cups... received 4 cups and that's it. Never came back with more. We again asked for more cups some 10-15 min later and she STILL never gave enough.  Can she not count???? Asked for napkins and she gave 2! Were we suppose to split that amongst 14 people??    Desserts took forever to arrive, and arrived at various times. Employees didn't seem to know what was on the menu. Heck, one of them couldn't even tell whether the dessert cup size she served was a large or jumbo.   Asked for separate checks and they were so confused. 14 separate checks please. Oh here... we split it into 3 chunks and you go figure it out.   Service overall was horrendous. -10 stars.  Price: more expensive than all the other better dessert/drink choices in the same plaza.   Other fun observations - Orders was slow and backed up and will be 20+ min wait. The restaurant (hotpot and dessert combined) wasn't even busy this Friday night. How many people they got working the kitchen? 1?! - Waitress trying to explain why orders were slow. They had to cut fresh mangoes for each dessert. Again... just 1 person working? What about all the other 3-4 waitresses standing around? - Employees in general are not trained and have no clue what is going on.  - Hui Lau Shan shares the same Chinese name as Tracy Dessert at FMP, which is much better. They aren't the same."}
{"text":"By looking at its name, I thought it carries its reputation of mango desserts. I went inside the restaurant, the decoration of the restaurant looks pretty unique, it looks like the traditional style of dim sum restaurants. As I sat down at a table, I found out that each table has a simmer top and that maybe the reason why I started to feel hot and stuffy.   I came with a group of friends and we had a company of about 15 people. We had a hard time in stopping a waitress at our table to take our orders. At last, one waitress stopped by but she just stayed for a short time. She took two of our orders and rushed to do something else. The rest of my group tried to tell that waitress to take all of our orders but she's gone no where. Shortly after, a second waitress came with empty hands. We had to tell her to bring a piece of paper and a pen to take the rest of our orders. After all the orders were taken, she came back and told us to expect at least 20 minutes of wait.  I wish I could have known that before the order was taken. Although the drink tastes good with real sweet mangoes, I don't think I will come back again. It's ridiculous for the service and the wait."}
{"text":"Never been to Hong Kong but it's pretty good for Toronto standards. A little on the pricey side though. Got the mango coconut sago and the mango coconut jelly, too much sago but taste is good, the jelly one is much better."}
{"text":"Brought back those memories from Hong Kong.  It's normally my go to place when I go there since it's like at every corner of every street.  Hui Lau Shan opened inside Simmer Huang.  Not sure if they are geared towards take out or not as it's just a counter inside the restaurant.  The friendly staff did asked if it was for here or to go though.  My friend and I bought the Aloe and the Mango Coconut both deliciously made - not too sweet yet freshening.  Still not as good as Hong Kong, possibly because the mangoes are just not the same here - the ones in Hong Kong is fresher, juicier and sweeter.  None the less, it's close enough.  It on the pricier side at just under $7 for a regular mango drink, but it's a good alternative to bubble tea."}
{"text":"After badminton, we were thinking to go to Tracey Desert and a friend mentioned that a same store is now open at commerce gate.  When you first walk in, you will think you went to the wrong place because it share the same entrance with a hotpot restaurant.  It seem to be inappropriate to have desert there while hotpot smell is all over the restaurant.  The atmosphere is just not right.  Once we sat there we waited for a long period for a waitress to come by to serve us.  Note that it was after 10:30pm and there's not many people in the restaurant.  The service was very slow and once we look at the menu, we realized this is a different restaurant that has the same Chinese name as Tracey Desert.  The registered English name is different.  We order different items off the menu.  I've order a drink with mango coconut and sago.  I waited well over 20mins for the drink.  The drink does not look like the picture in the menu.  I didn't see any diced mango in my drink but only sago, coconut juice and some mango juice mixed together.  I was very disappointed with the drink.  My friends have similar experience while they are there.  My friends (couple) didn't even get their order after 30mins.  The manager compensate by not charging their order.  I don't think I will go back again.  We all thought it was a new branch of Tracey Desert but in fact it is not."}
{"text":"Ordered 1 dessert to go, I waited for 30 mins, the restaurant wasn't too busy, only 1 server was working so hard for dessert orders, while others were walking around and not helping.   The restaurant smelled so bad like curry and hot pot, my outfit was full of hotpot smell after waiting for 30 mins for my dessert.   Lastly, it's quite expensive for a dessert, will not be back again."}
{"text":"Love the Hui Lau Shan in HK so I was incredibly excited to try their first Canadian outpost.  If I didn't know any better, I would have thought it was a cheap knockoff.  I didn't mind that it was located inside of a hot pot restaurant, but the staff seemed undertrained and the quality was unnecessarily terrible.  Mango Pancake: 95% whipped cream, tiny sliver of sour mango.  Mango Fresh Fruit Juice (L): Small mango blended with several large scoops of ice.  There was too much ice for the drink to blend, so they kept adding half a cup of water at a time until it worked.  As expected, tasted like water.  A1 Mango and Coconut with Mango Jelly (L): not nearly as good as Hong Kong.  The drink tasted much more of coconut and syrup than mango.  If I had to guess, it's partially owing to the mangoes they're able to source, coupled with inexperience and lack of quality control.  This place does a disservice to the brand, and the inflated prices aren't justified by the quality of the food."}
