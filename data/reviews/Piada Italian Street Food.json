{"text":"What happened to this place? It was so amazingly unexpectedly delicious when it first opened. Now, the people are not nearly as nice as they used to be and the piadas have gotten so sloppy they're not that appetizing to eat. Piada please fix yourself!"}
{"text":"The service was a little slow, but they just opened. I'm sure it'll improve with the experience the workers gain. Everyone was working real hard trying to provide service as quick as possible.
This my first Piada experience and I'd like to say that I'm definitely a fan. It's nice to have something a little different from Chipotle. I got the Chicken Fritte Piada. All the ingredients tasted fresh and very well cooked. Also added the side of Piada Garlic Dough. A nice simple side...I wouldn't get it with a Piada again, because it's to much tortilla for one meal. It would definitely be a better complement with a past bowl.
Can't wait to go back and try one of those!"}
{"text":"A great casual Italian dining with freshness that melts in your mouth. . As someone rightly pointed out it is the \" Italian Chipotle\".  
They have yummy vegetarian options as well. Light yet hearty I would say"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried it for the first time last night. I liked my chicken piada and my wife tried a chicken pasta dish which she really liked. I was glad that I ate first before going to the restroom, because if I had not I probably would have lost my appetite. It could've really used a good cleaning."}
{"text":"bright neat place, pasta is fantastic, also a big fan of the crispy chicken tasca, love to be here"}
{"text":"Pointless to order on line,  staff unapologetic for delay.  Order was to be ready at 3:45 it is now 4:03 and is still being prepared.  Should have gone to the Beachwood location"}
{"text":"Quick, yummy, good price.
I visited there twice within a week. 
I personally love their cabonara. By the way, I'll try to check other sauce out later."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times now and I have to say this place is mediocre at best. I have not had good luck with the service. Usually the first two pole that work on my pasta bowl are friendly and helpful. By the time I get to the end of the line, the people are rude and seem confused on what to do. 

The line tends to be long but they do move quickly. The sauce options are ok but they are not all that flavorful and the chicken doesn't always taste fresh.  I don't think my food has ever been hot. I would say it's warm but not ever hot. 

The garlic dough is delicious though. I usually make my own pasta bowl.  It is average priced for a create your own place however you can spend a little more and get much better quality food and better service. 

I won't be going out of my way to eat here in the future. Limited seating as well. If you have another option, go there first."}
{"text":"Made my first visit to this establishment last night. One word: AWFUL. I placed my order online and it quoted a pick-up time of 9:15. I arrived at 9:20 and they hadn't even started making my food. The cashier had no idea how to ring an online order and wasn't even aware that I had already paid when I placed my order. The customer service was terrible and made you feel like you were a pain in the ass for being there. I ordered a salad and garlic dough. My salad was missing 2 items that I requested and I received some sort of pepperoni bread instead of what I ordered. Will never visit this location again. My 9:15 pick up ended up being a 40 minute wait. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I work near PIADA. The location is great for a quick lunch and the ambiance is fantastic. Amazing Italian Sodas and a lot of toppings. The good things end there. The service is very bad.. too many people at the counter... they just keep talking to each other and dont listen to what you want to say.. 

 I got  a pasta bowl and a cup of tomato basil bisque, which was really salty. For the pasta bowl, I specifically requested Hot pasta ( based on the reviews here) but it was just warm...The garlic cheesy bread was so so... It was under whelming...

I have eaten at better places around this place and am not sure if I want to go back..."}
{"text":"Piada is a growing chain that started in Columbus.  Many people describe it as \"Italian Chipotle\" which is pretty accurate as it's a fast casual place where you custom build your meal.  I've tried multiple locations and they are consistently good. 

Rocky River one just opened, and I participated in the craziness of \"first 100 people, Piada for a year.\" They delivered, the first 100 got 52 free cards, and a free meal right when they opened. I think the company is doing it right in spending a bit of money in marketing to get the word out; it will pay back.

Of course it will be busy for a while and maybe a little slow, but I thought they moved through the first 100+ pretty quickly considering it was their first day, and how many people in that line had never been to a Piada before. The staff was very friendly.

You can get out of there under $10 with entree and drink, but it does get pricey when you start adding sides, etc. I think it's worth it based on the good, fresh ingredients and huge portion sizes. The Italian sausage is my favorite (a little spicy), but I haven't tried everything yet. 

If Piada reads this, bring back the Arrabbiata sauce!"}
{"text":"Felt exactly like an Italian version of chipotle. So I went to the line and ordered super quickly, a la soup Nazi style in the typical high pressure Chipotle tradition.  The girl making my food was very impressed with how quickly I made decisions without confusion, so my guess is this fast food concept a little bit more laid-back.

My pasta dish was very good, I combined chicken, cheeses, roasted red peppers and sun-dried tomatoes. Good concept and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience..   I came to try it for the first time..  The staff was friendly but the food wasn't that great especially for the price. They truly have redefined ripping off the customer..     They made me pay twice once for just a bowl of noodles which I got the largest size and it didn't even fill the bowl up a third of the way should have got the small.  Then they changed me again for the main dish and said that the main dish doesn't come with it..    Really the main dish is what the meal is based on..   They changed me for everything cheese tomatoes EVERY Single THING..      I'll NEVER go anywhere near one of these rip off restaurants again"}
{"text":"Went in for a quick lunch.

Line can look long but moves fast. Very efficient operations and staff. System (and the interior decor for that matter) is very much in the style of Chipotle, Sweetgreen, and the like.

Food was ok overall. Fresh ingredients, though sauces and soups are a bit on the salty/creamy side. You can get piada, pasta, or salad to customize. The piadas are quite nice, though not blow your mind away awesome. The portion is not huge, but your meal can still get close to 1000 calories.

Price is on the high side for a fast-casual chain. Expect to pay $1-2 premium total over national chains.

Overall, this is a place for a slightly fancy office lunch. If my friend or co-worker wants to go, I'd have no problem tagging along. But this isn't somewhere that I'd visit regularly by myself."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, they specialize in an Italian wrap called a piada. The actual wrap itself was very thin and almost crispy, the filling was very fresh tasting and tasty, I had sausage, roasted red peppers, and artichoke hearts.  I also had the pepperoni roll which was great.  The service was friendly and fast, the entire setup is basically Chipotle but with Italian food instead of Mexican. There was also a very corporate vibe to the layout and decor, quite sterile and over-lit.  The music being piped in was terrible as well. Basically it's a great place to grab a bite to go but I wouldn't hang out in there."}
{"text":"Awesome food. The taste was amazing mix of flavor and quality. I would love to go back to this place."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Piada. The food was just okay but tonight it was really good. The service was good not the usual rude service. They were very a tentative. I love the food and it was on point tonight. I was getting ready to give up on them. The customer service was good. No favoritism just plain old good service. See u soon!!"}
{"text":"When I saw \"Italian street food\" as the description, I was expecting Italian street food; that's not literal. After *walking inside*, I waited in the long lunch line, which moved at a steady pace. I ordered the summer piada, which was the perfect fill for lunchtime. The seasoning of the piada itself was a bit strong, but otherwise happy first-time customer."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, it is like an Italian chipotle. You can choose between pasta, salad or a piada (a thin tortilla like bread, seasoned and brushed with olive oil). I have tired one of each and I enjoyed all of them! I've never went wrong at this place, the ingredients are fresh, the sauces are made at the restaurant, and the portions are large.

For dessert, you can order cannoli chips and dip which is very yummy.

The ambience inside is really nice and clean.

Exceptional place, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Such good food at reasonable prices! The portions are huge and very filling! I got the garlic dough and a carbonara pasta and it was so amazing. The place was clean on the inside and the line looked extremely organized. Everyone was very polite with me not exactly knowing what I wanted and helped so much. The atmosphere, character, quickness, food quality and taste really blew me away on this place. Would give more than 5 stars if that was a thing. Will come back many more times for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Really good. Needed a little more help from the order takers for first time. Loved the environment."}
{"text":"I just got the carbonara pasta today and it was not all that great. The warm pan they use to heat your food in does not get the food hot at all. Also the method they use like a bar to assemble all your ingredients to mix is not all that great. It's not full bodied flavored at all. I give it an ok taste. When I got my food it was room temperature and had to ask them to leave it in the pan on warmer longer. My chicken was cold and the rest was only room temperature!!"}
{"text":"The meatballs are wonderful as are the salads.  Don't understand why the workers insist in putting the side bread in the bowl of pasta where it instantly becomes greasy and inedible.    Ask for it on the side and you will have a great meal.    Italian sodas are excellent."}
{"text":"I first had Piada on a road trip in Ohio. My first thought was why isn't this everywhere? I was so excited for one to open up in Pittsburgh and couldn't wait for opening day. Their calamari is the bomb. Yesterday I went after class, and after only a wait of like 8 minutes, they gave us a complimentary meal. I mean, how good of a management is that? Highly recommend. I know this sounds like it would be from someone who works for Piada, but trust me its just that good!"}
{"text":"I've ordered the pasta and salad and both were sort of slimy. I wanted to like this place, but it doesn't quite achieve the \"Chipotle of Italian.\""}
{"text":"Went to this Piada twice within the last week. Both times,  the staff was pretty slow and didn't really seem to care about how fast the line moved or about service.  Nobody would really explain the menu-- which takes a little figuring out before you know how their \"system\" works. Nobody explains what the sauces are. They have several to choose from but I didn't want to sit there and ask what each is.  This Piada could be run better.  I think it's probably how it's managed.  Sometimes corporate food is better than local because corporate places will go the extra mile to make sure your experience is consistently good and the same every time you go in. My impression here is that the manager doesn't really give two poops.

The food isn't that good.  I don't know how to explain it.  It's not really food.  Look up Piadas online.  The piada they serve doesn't even really look like a true piada.  One of my visits I had an Italian sausage piada.  They rolled it like a burrito.  An Italian street piada is closer to a flatbread or panini style grilled sandwich. One of my other visits I had a pasta dish which they put into a pan for some reason. It never went onto any heat or grill. The server mixed the ingredients and then put it into my bowl. Not sure why it even went into a pan.

The only reason I didn't give this place a 1 star rating is that the food is just barely okay.  I'm determined to not ever eat here again but my girlfriend might still drag me here...

Also the photos on this page make it seem like super fresh food.  It's a little inaccurate. It's \"fresh\" yes. But it isn't as fresh as these photos make it seem."}
{"text":"We loved this place!  The food is flavourful and filling. Great to sit, enjoy the food and watch the Oakland street scene. Very clean, new and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Busy on day one. Folks lined up out the door not quite to the pile of sleeping bags/tents left on the sidewalk from the vagrants who spent the night before vying for free food for a year.

1:14 pm opening day:

Two moms and one 12 year old for lunch. 
Mom #1 had small salad, small pasta, 1 Piada stick, small soda. Mom #2 ordered small pasta bowl, 1 Piada (burrito) and a small soda. Boy 12 ate small pasta bowl with big meatball and drank a small soda. Tab $39.70. 

Food was ok. Egg-allergy people beware the Calamari, Piada stick and the Chicken battered in buttermilk all contain egg. Lots of creamy looking dressings better to ask about them than have an anaphylactic episode. 

Italian soda on one side US soda on the other. The orange Italian soda was yummy. No liquor is served. The employees were very helpful in getting the egg info, I'll give them time to learn the menu so should you.

The greeter may ask you as he did us on the first day \"have you ever been here before?\" Go try it just don't think its going to be cheap."}
{"text":"Excellent for a quick and fresh lunch. Food has always been very good in my experience. Calamari salad is delicious! Not ideal for quiet business meetings and there is typically a long, though fast-moving line at lunch."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday, 4/25/14 with the boyfriend for lunch.  I was given a gift card by a friend who camped out, and I have been wanting to go here ever since.   We went about 2 in the afternoon, which was a good time for first timers since we could take our time and figure out what we wanted.  Being used to and LOVING Chipotle, the system is similar therefore familiar, which helps.  I got a small pasta bowl with the \"hot\" Alfredo sauce.  It was accidentally knocked over, quickly restarted and with much heartfelt apology.   I had cheese (and lots of it :)  ) with artichokes.  The boyfriend had a chef style (meaning it was prepared the way it is on the menu) of calamari much to my grossness.  (I am NOT eating anything that can taste me back, is looking at me, or that could suction itself to me!  No thank you!  UGGH!)   We got Italian sodas and  the price is what we would have spent at Chipotle, so it is very affordable   The sauce was not as temperature hot as I would have liked, so the dish was cold in spots, but hey, it's pasta,s so it can be eaten cold, which I do frequently, so I was not upset.  The best part was the garlic piada that comes with the pasta or the salad.  It reminded me of Naan, which I LOVE and I love garlic naan, so already liking it.  IT'S FULL OF CHEESE!    I am an unabashed cheese freak (you can never have too much cheese or chocolate).  The artichokes were cleaned, grilled with nice crispy char, and (cue the fan fare) acidulated ( you need to put fresh ones in water with lemon juice or they turn brown. Like avocado's for guac.)   I have been to nice Italian restaurants and have not seen this level of care and proper prep.    The boyfriend said that the calamari was tender and delicious.  (I'll take his word for it.)  The Divalo sauce had bite he said, but would not clean your sinuses.  

I so cannot wait until I can go back.  So good!"}
{"text":"This place is great! It is basically an Italian version of chipotle- you pick a piada (a wrap), pasta bowl or salad and the choose what toppings you want.  The name makes it sound like a sit down restaurant, but it is more of a grab and go type place.   This place is a great deal and is almost comparable to the quality you would get at Olive Garden. Also the wine is so cheap..it is $1.25 for a glass of the house wine on tap."}
{"text":"I've been to Piada quite a few times.  I enjoy this \"chipotle-esque\" fast-food-but-not style eating establishment.  
My favorite item is the choose your own salad with chicken (add roasted veggies, pancetta, all other veggies and skinny vin dressing) and that has quickly become my menu of choice.  I also order a children's portion choose your own pasta (chicken, spinach, veggies, pomodoro sauce) and a piada (sausage, roasted peppers and onions, mozzarella cheese, mushrooms, artichokes and pomodoro sauce) for the hubs.  
At first I didn't know they had children's portions and prices because it is not posted, but it is in the paper menu and this is good to know.
They don't do a lot of cooking at this place and the soup is pre-made, comes in a bag and probably most of the topping offerings come from a can...but I don't get the soup anyway and I love olives, so I didn't let this hinder my review.
The service can be slow at times but I'm hoping that this is because it is a newer place and the staff is still getting used to the pace.  We shall see.  Overall it is a fun place with tasty food."}
{"text":"I ordered this from Uber Eats. I've wanted to try it for a while and I decided to take advantage of the new delivery option via Uber Eats. That being said, I can't speak to much on how the place operates. I ordered the Basil Pesto pasta with crispy chicken fritte, with a blackberry hibiscus lemonade. The food was delicious and fresh tasting. Even in the cream sauce, the chicken remained crisp.The portion size was great. I upgraded to a large portion, not knowing the size of the regular. I know now that the regular size would have been just fine. The lemonade was very refreshing but tasted like normal strawberry lemonade to me, just less tart. Nonetheless, it still tasted good."}
{"text":"It's just like an Italian subway or chipotle. The food is very good and the portions are big. The staff seemed a little like none of them wanted to be there though."}
{"text":"Piada is a nice addition to Oakland.  I tried the pesto pomodoro meatball pasta.  Their large grass-fed  beef meatballs are moist and tasty.  Pepperoni sticks are tasty and filling.  I wasn't a fan of the harvest grain salad (the red wine dressing was too sweet).  Everything looks good and the prices are extremely reasonable, especially for the larger bowls which are enough for a couple lunches if you save leftovers.  The line moves pretty quickly here too, and the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience. They kept skimping on the servings, the servers used the same gloves and dug their hands into both the veggies AND meats as they topped our dishes. If you're a vegetarian, I'd stay faaaar away from this place."}
{"text":"Great Pasta. Bad Playlist. Some bangers.. some throwbacks.. some... fall out boy?? A jarring mix of Sia, Demi Lovato and the Vamps, and once again... Fall Out Boy???? A little too erratic for my taste. Makes my pesto less appetizing. I suggest playing some Lorde and even some Cardi B. That will bring in the costumers. But once again great pasta."}
{"text":"YESSSSSSSS

I always make the Regular Chicken Diavolo pasta bowl (Ask for extra chicken lol) with some olives, red peppers, greens, sometimes bacon, and garlic bread

Huge servings and affordable

Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I love to go here on Wednesdays for $5 pasta bowls with college ID.  Chicken Diavolo is my absolute favorite.  I have yet to have a bad experience with this location.  The employees are very nice, food is good, portions are consistent."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times now but will no longer do so.  It's pricey for what you get. The food is okay but inconsistent...sometimes cold and skimpy on ingredients and sometimes just what I expected.  There are always long lines and when it is my time to order, I always feel a bit rushed.  As a whole, it's usually not too bad.  Until tonight.
I ordered dinner tonight to go for my family and told the lady I was allergic to fish and shellfish.  I know the menu has salmon and calamari and I wanted to avoid anaphylaxis.  The lady dismissed me, didn't advise the chef, or anyone else.  The chef didn't change his gloves and handled both my chicken and the calamari someone else ordered.  In fact, no one changed their gloves, including her. I am tired of having to defend my already  inconvenient allergy.  I have quit complaining about it because  people get irritated that I have special needs.  So, I paid and left.
Unfortunately, I will not be eating my dinner - I don't want to risk it. I am sharing my experience only because others with similar food allergies may want to consider eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"Piada takes everything that is great about Italian food,  then kills it by setting it in an overdone fast casual concept. Fast Italian defeats the purpose of Italian eating! Sauce was not flavorful, meat was under seasoned, portions were dauntingly large.  The Piada breadsticks were OK,  but you just can't do some foods in this  concept, and Italian is one of them."}
{"text":"Like others have said its the Italian version of Chipotle... which means the food is a cheap version of real Italian food. Yeah its fast food so my expectation wasn't high and I truly wasn't impressed with the taste or quality of the food. If you want Italian on the go then I guess this is your only option, but go some place else if youre in a rush and get the Italian fix at a restaurant that knows how to make it properly."}
{"text":"Would give 3 stars for the food but the servers so friendly helpful and fast--had to give them a star. Wasnt impressed with the food except garlic, pepperoni and cheese, and cheese roll ups. My kids and grandkids not impressed either but the experience was kinda fun.  In all fairness, I dont really like chipotles much either."}
{"text":"I have gone to Piada quite a bit and the food is great, but recently the service has been less than stellar. The past two times I have ordered online for carry out my meal has been made incorrectly. This is problematic when I'm picking up meals for the whole family. When I get the order I always try to check if it's all correct, but it's impossible to remember what each member of the family ordered as well. So it's upsetting after getting all the way home to find that some of our orders were incorrect. One time I can understand, but it's now happened twice in a row making me wary of ordering online and picking up from this location again."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Plus, we were waiting in line and the electricity went completely out. I went to A Piada a few years back and it seemed way better then. Feel like it's gone down hill since the first time I visited."}
{"text":"I only ate here once! I'm giving it 2 stars because the staff was very friendly! However, the food was mediocre at best & very over price! I love the concept just wish it was executed better! Also, I think there could be be a few more options to choose from!"}
{"text":"Drove by this place a few times and one day decided to try it....it was ok. I had the Basil Pesto Pasta with Steak and garlic dough. I do not recommend the garlic dough mine was too salty. However, the Italian Soda was good!"}
{"text":"This place is like the Chipotle of pastas. First time
I came here, the line was extremely long. They're also not as fast as Chipotle so if the line is long, expect to wait around 15 minutes to order. The interior decor is pretty artsy and well-lit so restaurant looked quite appealing. Anyways, I got a small Basil Pesto Pasta (the large is a monstrosity. Immense portions). The pasta was decent, definitely not gourmet though. My only complaint about the pasta is that it had too much garlic. Other than that, I'll definitely try the other options when I visit this place again."}
{"text":"My wife and I went back for only the second time,  and it was as good as the first.  The line was much shorter this time, although any wait is worth it.  The servers behind the line were extremely helpful and pleasant,  helping us make our selections.  The calamari was the best i have ever eaten.  I made it a point to tell the manager about our experience - too often people are quick to complain but never to compliment.  I would highly recommend this establishment if you want a quick, filling  Italian mea.l"}
{"text":"Updated review: I don't know if they've worked out the kinks or if it just depends on what you order, but I've returned a few times and the quality of the food is much improved. 

I get a pasta bowl with pomodoro sauce and chicken. Maybe it's the creamy sauces that made me sick. Who knows - I'm obsessed with the place now."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent. I wish it wasn't. When the crispy chicken is actually crispy, it's great. But, when it's not, it's super soggy and mushy. And, that happens more often than not."}
{"text":"I don't mind stopping in every once on a while these days, after having most of the proteins. Usually, I get chicken or sausage. The meatball is just ok, as it has breadcrumbs and ricotta as the ingredients - I prefer less of the softening stuff and prefer it to be meatier, but whatever. The salmon is usually spot on and I enjoy that as well.

Not a fan at all of the steak. I recall trying it because it looked cooked to a perfect medium, but the texture of it was just awful. It was just way to rubbery and seemed cheap, if you will. It was borderline dog food and I was not at all into it. Other than that, the crispy chicken is bland and dry, and I avoid those.

Really disappointed to see that they no longer peel and cube the cucumbers. Instead they are just lazily sliced and quartered. 

Biggest problem is how other people in line feel like they need to reach over the glass barrier and point to what they want. It's disgusting. That's why the glass is there in the first place!!! Can't imagine how annoying it must be for a line-worker having someone rudely reach over and point to various items."}
{"text":"This was a major disappointment. We've been to this location before with generally good results. Today, however, may have turned us off to Piada for good. 

First, our 5 year-old son's kids' meal portion size was HALF what it usually is. He was asking for more food after the meal. 

Second, if you ask them to leave ANYTHING out of the pre-engineered dishes, you won't get the free side order of garlic dough. This is the dumbest thing I've heard in a while, but apparently it becomes a \"create your own\" order when you make any changes. For the \"service\" (their word, not mine) they're doing by letting you make changes, you forfeit the garlic dough. 

Really, Piada? Given the prices you charge, this comes across as really cheap."}
{"text":"I had the chicken bacon sandwich , lobster bisque and the pepperoni bread. Probably the best \"fast food\" I've ever had! The wrap had chicken tomato arugula pickle seasoning all in a homemade tortilla. Low carb and yet the most flavorful sandwich ever! The soup was excellent as well. A very filling meal for $10. They make it fast also so it would be a great spot for a work lunch."}
{"text":"After having a negative experience with Piada, I deleted my Yelp app and just recently re downloaded it to find a message from the manager apologizing and offering me a gift card. I never complained to the manager, rather they sought me out. I can't say the same for any other business I've left a review for. Since my experience I have been back and have had better service. (Still haven't gotten the meatball again)"}
{"text":"Every time I read that this place is like an Italian Chipotle's, I shudder. I dislike Chipotle's blend of over-spiced faux Mexican dishes and surly wait staff. So, I was hoping that those who used that description were joking or mistaken. In one way the two restaurants were alike: they both served poor imitations of good ethnic food. However, if Chipotle was overly spiced, Piada was much too bland. Neither of my guests cared for the food and we decided to give other restaurants a try. We were there in mid-March 2015."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered online and when he brought back our food my pasta was missing over half of the things I ordered. I asked for pesto, they gave me Alfredo, I had ordered red onion, spinach, cucumber and cheese and got none of those toppings. All I got was pasta, calamari with the wrong sauce. I will probably no longer use the online ordering BC I feel like I need to stand there and make sure they give me what I ask. Pretty disappointing BC the online ordering could be really convenient if they can follow any order."}
{"text":"If chipotle had a stupid Italian cousin it would be this place. There food is awkward."}
{"text":"I've been to the Piada locations in Columbus, and this one has the same quality and friendly, helpful service. A great lunch spot - I go for the pick 2 with a salad and small piada. Can't wait for the one in Rocky River to open!"}
{"text":"I was really pleasantly surprised by my experience here! I got a make-your-own Piada with chicken, tomatoes, cucumbers, spinach, and mozzarella. The flavors and portion size were spot-on! I really enjoyed having a Piada for the first time, the best way to describe it for those of you have never had one is an Italian burrito but the wrap portion of it is somewhere between a crepe and a tortilla but a little saltier. The way the restaurant is run is also great - I like how there's a chef running the show while at a fast casual restaurant. It really shows in the quality of the food and experience. Can't wait to return in the future and maybe try something from the delicious seasonal menu!"}
{"text":"ordered and paid on line. After waiting for the food, they charged me for tax for a take out- ( they reimbursed me when I caught it) After waiting 10 minutes past the scheduled pick up, the food was totally incorrect, ( I ordered a sandwich and got literally all the topping on the sandwich without the bread or the chicken piled in a bowl) they barely apologized and sent me on the way.  The only reason I am giving them 2 stars is because one of the staff members told me how they are trying to get it together. Definitely will not go back."}
{"text":"The girl who is supposed to greet you when you come in seemed irritated that we were there, or maybe that she was there. She finally acknowledged us after a few minutes.

I ordered a couple of meatballs. I drove 20 minutes to get meatballs. Of course, they were out of meatballs. It would take 20 minutes for them. 

Why wasn't the meatball shortage noticed earlier?  Why wait until your out before heating up some more??

I was VERY disappointed and don't think I'll bother going back for a long time."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chef Fav. Piada and it was amazing. Just enough spice to add depth of flavor but not overwhelm the other flavors in this wrap. The wrap was crispy, not hard and not soggy (even after waiting for it to be delivered) I will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"I love the food! I just wish the staff was happier to be there. I don't understand the 'toods folks. I'm a regular friendly customer who loves Piada, but I don't love the unfriendliness off the the employees. They rush you through and act like its a difficult chore to add anything to your bowl. Makes me not want to frequent Piada anymore."}
{"text":"Love Piada and this was my first visit at this location. Great customer service, workers were friendly and greeted me with smiles. They were very polite and the line moved rather quickly. I can't personally speak on the food because I just picked it up for my daughter but it looked yummy and she confirmed that it was."}
{"text":"Line is always long but tonight they were getting it done! Staff was friendly and not upset that they had a big rush towards closing time. They were courteous and professional and handled their business. I love their piadas and I visit quite often! Great job!"}
{"text":"Piada is like an Italian-style Chipotle.  You order at the counter and can see most of the ingredients before you decide what you want.  I had a Piada (like a burrito) with calamari and nearly everything else.  I thought it was just ok.  I like the concept, but was really expecting more flavor.  I don't know what the problem was, but there was definitely a disconnect between all the delicious looking food on my plate and the 'meh' taste in my mouth.  The Italian sodas and the pepperoni roll were both standouts.  I like the idea enough that I'd give it another try and hope for better results.

We came at lunch time on a weekday, and it was very busy.  The line moved fast though and I had no issues with service."}
{"text":"It's the Italian version of Chipoltle. Cheap, fast, great fresh veggies, lots of options. Great place!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food with healthy options. The flavored teas are amazing. Staff was very friendly and courteous, especially Chef Brad. Great atmosphere. Overall, fantastic place to eat with great people and great food."}
{"text":"I can't save enough about this restaurant.  You can't get any better customer service and the quality of food has always been great.  Their staff goes above and beyond to ensure that you have a great experience.  One of the staff members had overheard us saying that it was my daughter's birthday.  They showed up at our table with a birthday treat (no charge to us).   The food is fresh and made to order.  I personally like the BLT but my husband and daughter rave about their pasta.  You can add all kinds of special toppings on your pasta.  ie add spice with freshly fried calamari. We have been to the Oakland Piada restaurant and have also had an outstanding experience at that location.  Piada is our \"go to\" restaurant when we want to please the entire family.   I give it a big thumbs-up!"}
{"text":"So, I'm updated my review again!   It had been awhile since I had been back to Piada since they took away most if not all of the selections that I enjoyed with my pasta.   I decided to take a look online to see if maybe, by chance, they had brought anything back and YES!   Everything is back except for the raw red onions (they still have pickled red onions).   I jumped into my car and sped up there right away.  I am so happy.   I can now enjoy Piada again with my artichoke hearts, mushrooms, pancetta, cucumbers and all the fixings that I enjoy.  While in line getting my bowl ready and chatting with the manager, she stated that the menu change upset a LOT of people - so they complained and Piada listened.    Thank you Piada, please don't change a thing."}
{"text":"The food tastes good, but if you have tried the Italian original do not expect anything similar. This is the American interpretation of an Italian classic. You will be disappointed if you expect a real Italian piada, but you will love it if you have never tried the original."}
{"text":"Had this catered at work today! Food was great! Will stop by next time I am in the neighborhood for more"}
{"text":"I was excited for the opening of Piada because it's different from anything that is in Oakland. On campus, you can get burgers from Five Guys, burritos from Chipotle, and Chinese food from many places, but you couldn't get Italian food. But then Piada came into town. Suddenly, I could get pasta without going through the trouble of making it at home. 
When I walked into the restaurant, I noticed that everything looked very clean. the system for ordering food is very similar to Chipotle's. You order step-by-step; first, you choose between pasta, piada (a thin wrap), or salad; then, you choose your protein and sauce; and lastly, you choose your toppings. Personally, I like this system because it keeps the line flowing, and you get to choose specifically what you want in your meal. However, one thing that bothered me was when I was choosing my toppings, the worker asked me if I wanted the suggested toppings, and I replied, \"yes, please.\" She then proceeded to push my order along without asking me if I wanted anything added. I did stop her to ask her for more vegetables in my pasta, but in my opinion she should have asked if I had wanted anything more. 
The food itself was very healthy-feeling, and the portions were more than enough. For the price, the amount that I was getting was definitely worth it. I even had some to save for the next day. The pasta to meat ratio could have been a bit better by having a bit more meat. Also, there was not enough sauce for my liking. I found the meal a bit dry as did my roommate and parents. However, when we asked for a bit more sauce, they were more than willing to give us that extra scoop. 
Another thing that bothered me about Piada was the lack of seating. With the instant popularity of this restaurant, many people come to sit down and eat here. The kitchen and line take up about a third of the space, so seating was a bit difficult to find.
Overall, I would recommend this place to others. Don't be afraid to ask for what you want because they are very willing to accept your requests. Be aware that the seating is a bit tight. But I did enjoy eating at this restaurant for its cleanliness, delicious food, and friendly employees."}
{"text":"Piada is a good place for a quick and easy bite. There are 5 to 6 options of pastas, each customizable with sauces and toppings... It's like the Chipotle of italian food. A bit greasy but delicious with generous portions."}
{"text":"Solid quick Italian food. We have been to a few and really enjoy it.  We are hoping one comes to Medina Ohio soon!  Especially impressed with the service.  My wife added the Calamari & Peppers which seemed to only have the Calamari in it (not a total loss). When we asked we were told it should have both. We sat back down and continued to enjoy our meal. In a few minutes AJ brought a fresh batch of new Calamari & Peppers and apologized.  Although one was not needed we most certainly appreciated his great service.  Thanks AJ!  Come and open one in Medina!!"}
{"text":"I went during their soft opening and was able to taste most of the things on the menu and everything is good and the people who work there are fast because my friends and I all got our food quickly and it was fresh!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and it is absolutely delicious. 

I ordered the Piada with a side salad. 
Half Piada and soup or salad is plenty of food for one person. 

All the ingredients for the Piada were fresh and delicious. 

Staff was extra friendly and helpful. 

The menu style and restaurant setup is comparable to chipotle. Easy to pick out your meal and reasonably quick. 

I absolutely recommend this place to anyone. 

Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I tried this place out with my friend closer to its grand opening. I like the set-up (it's very similar to Hello Bistro, Lotsa, Qdoba and Chipotle in how the workers guide you in creating-your-own food down line). They also offer signature menu items.

The food itself was good for a fast-food Italian place. I honestly felt so fancy being there as the interior is classy and clean.

The service there was very nice. The workers were all smiles and suggestions. You can tell they actually put care into your food.

The price is honestly very fair for what they give you.

I definitely will come and try again! It's a nice, but not-too-nice place to go with friends/significant others. A great place to just take-out food as well."}
{"text":"My daughter was offered a job here before the opening but needed work before their opening date so she is down the street. Last night my son, his friend and I were wracking our brains for someplace to eat, an overload of choices makes it as difficult to choose as if there were a scarcity of choices. Someone mentioned Italian. I suggested this place. Italian street food? What does that mean? Pizza? So we walked in the door with the menu right there in front of us. As more people followed in line, it was a quick decision. I opted for the Diavolo Piada with steak, rolled up like a burrito. My co-eaters chose the Carbonara and Diavolo Pasta. All great and tasty choices prepared in minutes in front of our eyes. Diavolo-spicy. Just enough spice. I greedily ate too fast. We were all full after that meal with no leftovers to take home. My son suggested the carbonara needed just a bit more sauce as his only complaint for the pasta he ordered with crispy chicken. The other Diavolo order-just enough spice there too. The dessert was tasty but nothing special. I'd probably pass unless I just wanted to eat the frosting/filling to satisfy a sweet craving. I'd love to have some lemon cream cake or some other choice. The Italian sodas, great. I'd come in just for a drink of one of them. Definitely a fan of this place that Pittsburgh was lucky to get. We plan on trying some more of their choices. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Fast and convenient food. Fresh and made on arrival. I had the salad with salmon. I appreciated how my fish was made to order. I also appreciated how the pesto was made without pine nuts. Because I have an allergy. Overall great experience. Modern and very clean look to the place. Staff was friendly and answered my questions."}
{"text":"There was an extreme amount of health code violations that I felt the employees were not aware of while serving food. I enjoy the spaghetti but the price is pretty steep for what You get!!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time and it was pretty good. I kind of reminds me of chipotle. You get noodles and meat and add whatever toppings you want. I had the basil pesto pasta with chicken. It's a lot of food for the money. Even the bread stick with pepperoni in it was good. I'll definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"First time to try the place... staff was very helpful and educated me on the Piada... Diavolo piada w/chicken... excellent! 
I will be back to try more...."}
{"text":"I went to Piada, hoping to try some Italian street food. This was my very first visit to Piada. I was impressed by the architecture of the place. It is a nice and big place. Somehow I could not help but notice so many similarities to Chipotle. 

The servers were as confused as the customers. They did not know much of the content specifications of all the sauces. There was a lot of confusion while making salads and the lady at the check out counter forgot to gave us ranch dressing as dipping sauce (Italian??). Food was okay, I have not been to Italy but I am sure that they have more flavor than this place on their streets. I was not impressed by their hottest hot sauce. And of course the Piada was more like a burrito. Their salads looked nice and large but that does not sound like something I would order in a Piada place. 

It is better avoided unless you really want to try something new and different and not necessarily good."}
{"text":"I had heard good reviews and they were right! The parking is tricky but worth it. Piada serves an Italian version of Chipotle but the food is seasoned far better in my opinion. The tortilla style bread is warmed, spread with butter, and seasoned prior to filling it with the ingredients of your choice. I tried mine with fried chicken but hope to try the grilled chicken during my next visit.  The cost was reasonable too."}
{"text":"Our first time here, and it is really unique. I would say look at the menu before you come because when you are waiting in line it is very intimidating. All the food was fresh and extremely tasty. We got the chicken BLT and the Tuscan Piada with salmon  a side of the lobster bisque. My husband tried the Italian berry soda...WONDERFUL! Everything was great. It did seem though that they needed more workers. The line did not move as fast as it could have, but every worker was overly nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Meh, it's OK.   Their stuff to me can be a bit too salty, secondly, they can be slow at this location which can get very busy.   I have been there and seen lines out the door, but I think that has more to do with the slow part than having killer food.

Don't get me wrong, the food isn't horrible.   It just isn't good enough to warrant me going out and paying for it.   We have some folks where I work who just love this place (and Chipotle - which is another overrated place), so maybe I am just being too picky or their menu just doesn't suit me.

Like Chipotle, you need to be careful here because the food is marketed as fresh and healthy but they can be absolute calorie bombs...like in the several hundred to thousands range.   Frankly, this place was a couple visits and done experience for me."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place. Tried the Italian Trio sandwich. All fresh ingredients. Delicious tasting. Mike the head guy was very personable and inviting. Their blueberry hibiscus lemonade was huge and refreshing. And the shrimp bisque was hot, very tasty. The Mrs. loved the pesto pasta. (Pesto made in house) said it was best she has ever had. We will be Back."}
{"text":"OK. So it's not bad tasting. This is literally Chipotle with pasta, though. They call it \"Street Food\" to make it ok. I'm ok with ideas being reused, so it's not that, however, to charge what they do for essentially leftovers is a little insulting. I mean when's the last time you paid $35 to buy yourself and two buddies a hotdog and soda from the guy with the cart on the corner? I may go again, however, it is just spaghetti and salad bar with reheated meat and sauces."}
{"text":"I've driven past here twice a day almost every day for six months and never stopped in until recently for lunch. I was intrigued by other's who described it as a \"Chipotle for Italian food\". I love Chipotle and Italian, so this sounded right up my alley. 

First and foremost, the facilities - they were extremely clean. The food offerings were good as well, as they offered salads, piada's and bowls; I stuck with a pesto pasta bowl with chicken, sun dried tomatoes, Alfredo sauce, and Parmesan cheese. One nice touch I especially appreciated is that the Parmesan is freshly grated over your dish. They offer sides and regular fountain drinks as well, but my favorite part is the Italian soda they have through a separate fountain machine. Normally Italian soda is difficult to find outside of glass bottles and is quite expensive, so having it out of a fountain at a decent price is amazing. I would recommend stopping in even just to get that alone. 

The food tasted good, but the chicken was hit or miss - some of it was great, but many pieces were grisly or hard and unable to be eaten. All in all, I'll probably go here once in a while for lunch (or one of those Italian soda's!) but will steer clear of the chicken in the future."}
{"text":"This place just opened up a few weeks ago in the northway mall area and it was well worth the wait.  Like others have said, it's similar to an Italian food Chipotle.  I was pretty hungry coming into here which was a mistake because I ended up ordering $30 worth of food.  I got the chef's special piada which is kinda like an italian burrito with meat and pasta sauce inside.  It was really good.  I also got the porchetta sandwich, it was also good but maybe just a bit dry.  It could've used a bit of sauce. 
 The best deal here is probably the calamari.  It comes with fried hot peppers and is only $5.  Overall, this is probably one of the best \"fast-food\" spots in the area.

Porchetta Sandwich: 7/10
Chef's Special Piada: 8/10
Calamari: 9/10
Parmesan Rosemary Chips: 7/10"}
{"text":"So I decided to follow some fellow yelp reviewers advice and to add pasta and grilled chicken to the chef's favorite Piada. It was certainly very interesting and had a different flavor. The chicken and pasta was a nice addition. Something was very salty for my liking so I had to keep taking breaks. Not quite sure what it was. Either way it was a nice meal, I probably would come back and try the pasta bowls instead though."}
{"text":"Piada just opened their Parma store and I couldn't be happier. The staff is extremely enthusiastic and the food was fast and importantly, delicious. This is another entry in the made-to-order format where ingredients are in front of you, on display and your order is created in front of you. Chipotle, Naf Naf, Pizza Fire and others have made this a relatively common means of getting food, and Piada executes it well. I ordered Basil Pesto Pasta with added calamari and peppers. It was really tasty. Other offerings include the namesake Piada which is a wrap sandwich in a crispy, crepelike dough with options for fresh ingredients. Roasted sweet corn, avocado,  arugula, mozzarella, pancetta, peppers...many options to add. Pasta bowls, as mentioned, salads and a sandwich called a Tasca, also utilizing the flat bread but a slightly smaller round folded over into a triangle, which creates a layered sandwich. There are sides including roasted corn salad, garlic dough, pepperoni piada sticks, soup and meatballs. There is a kid's menu and a catering menu also.

I paid $12.50 for a healthy portion of spaghettini, white and basil sauce with sundried tomatoes, added calamari and peppers and a soda. There will be leftovers.

This is the first day they are open so the staff is very pumped, the chefs including the executive chef and training chef are on site and circulating and it's a regular party- and I totally recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm already thinking about what to order when I go back. (I had the sm. pasta carbonara & sweet Roma and feta salad). I'd skip the sweet and spicy peppers in the salad next time and double up on the bruschetta tomatoes---personal preference. Next time, I'd be looking at building my own pasta with red (pomodoro) sauce and maybe a grass fed meatball."}
{"text":"So had i wrote this back in the day, and I probably did at a different location, it would have been 4 star.  But over the past year or so their prices have gone up, noticeable.  While I still like the food it is starting to push that boundary, which is unfortunate.  They have already priced me out of some of their pepperoni stacks.  

That being said, they do change up the menu for the season to keep things interesting.  However there is the potential you will 'lose' your favorite item.  But change is the spice of life.

The staff is friendly, but things can get chaotic at lunch so pay attention to your order.

Also, top tip, you can swap out proteins.  So if you are on the adventurous side, swap some calamari for chicken.  Their calamari is surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Piada Italian Street Food is my new favorite addition to Cuyahoga Falls. I almost turned around when I read, \"Italian Street Food\". Sounds like an episode of Carb Loading 101. So glad I gave it a shot.

The ordering process is much the Chipotle. I ordered a hand-rolled Piada filled with pancetta, avocado, arugula, spicy balsamic aioli, mozzarella, pepitas & roasted sweet potato. Somehow there's bacon on there so I swapped it with steak. The serving was just right and I didn't walk out feeling 10 pounds heavier. If you're a soup lover order the cup of tomato basil...creamy and delicious! 


My only complaint is the lack of nutritional info. The menus say the calorie intake info, but what the heck is in my meat? The name Italian Street Food is so misleading from what you see when you're ordering. It looks healthy, but what am I actually eating? I couldn't find anything on the website. I'm going back tonight for dinner!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the hibiscus lemonade was amazing. Wonderful place and worth the 30 minute drive!"}
{"text":"So being new to the area, this was my first experience.  It is a pretty interesting concept for Italian.  It is the cafeteria/Chipotle  approach.  Order up front, move down the counter to get your additional add ins...  The food itself is pretty good and there is a lot of it.  They have beer and soda on tap.  The food is made fresh in front of you.  I don't think it was that pricy either.  The large bowls are big enough to split.  I am a big guy and was sharing to make sure it was all eaten.  

The inside is a little on the sterile side.  I have spent some amount of time in Italy and I was expecting something a little more warm, cozy, family oriented and authentic.  It is more German, sharp corner stainless steel feeling.  The outside however is nice.  Especially this time of the year it is great for friends to gather and hang out."}
{"text":"This place has been my go to lunch spot for the past two months that I have been working at Montefiore Hospital. I love the  energy of the place and the staff and that you can see them preparing your food. My go to meal is the power bowel (roasted chickpeas, blackened broccoli, cauliflower, sweet potato cubes, and pickled red onions) and true to its name keeps me full and satisfied all day long.  Although technically a \"fast food\" restaurant, the only aspect that lives up to this category is the speed at which you get your meal.  You can't go wrong with the quality you get."}
{"text":"I love that its provides something unique to Cuyahoga falls.  The food is really good especially the crispy chicken Alfredo pasta!  The place is neat and clean and the staff is great!  Check this place out."}
{"text":"After all the buzz about this new place I figured, being a foodie, I had to check it out. I got the \"chefs special piada\" and it was disappointing. The employees were nice and it's a well kept place inside but this place doesn't have great food. The piada was mostly sauce. Way too salty, any good Italian knows when a food is too salty they should counter it with some sugar or something. Not here. I'm not sure being in Pittsburgh people know what good Italian food is, but this is nothing like what you get in and around New York. Piada falls way shorter than my semi high expectations."}
{"text":"A must try for lunch if you are in the Oakland area!  Lucky for us it wasn't crowded on a Monday afternoon but I have heard the line can be out the door. All the food is made to order which makes it that much tastier.  I had no idea what to get and wanted to try it all. I decided on 3 sides-the side salad, a meatball, and parmesan stick.  The side salad was the perfect size with iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and olives with a creamy parmesan dressing. The have a few other salad options and you can get meat added in.  The side of a meatball was served in a bowl of sauce with parmesan cheese on top.  It was about the size of a grapefruit and delicious!   To top off the meal I got a parmesan stick (basically a long cheese breadstick) served with parmesan dressing to dip it in.  Are you sensing the parmesan theme?!!  They also have many sandwich and pasta dishes to choose from.  The prices are very reasonable and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"As far as the service we received, cleanliness, atmosphere, yada yada, this place is great!   Well, except for the fact that it was FREEZING in there.  They don't have a very good buffer between the door and the dining area.  They seemed a little unsure of the ingredients in the chef's specials, but I'm sure it's a lot to learn.  

As far as the food, I was a little disappointed.  While I haven't been to Italy and had a true piada, I expected a thicker dough kind of folded like a taco.  Instead, the dough is very thin and the piada is all folded up just like a burrito.  When I think Italian, I think chewy bread, garlic and cheese, tangy red sauce....  I didn't get any of these.  It was good, but it was a wrap.   I wanted more I guess.

The cannoli chips were neat, just little cannnoli shells that you dip in the chocolate chip filling on your own.  Warning: they will coat you in powdered sugar in one second.  

I enjoyed the Italian sodas, berry more than orange.  My husband loved the pepperoni stick.  I was hoping the garlic dough would be doughy and garlicy and come with red sauce, but it was just a quesadilla.

I would adore this place if it truly was more Italian."}
{"text":"It is not often that I like a side dish more than the main menu options, but one of the \"street sides\" is the main reason I even come to this establishment time and time again. The tomato basil soup is positively delicious.   It's creamy and thick and warms me right up. However, I was not pleased with the soup on my visit today 

The soup was chunky and the taste was very much off and there was a layer of oil on top when I opened my soup lid as if it had been sitting for hours in that bowl. I hope that this isn't some new recipe because I will find it hard to come back if this is the soup that I have to come back to."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Aloft next door for the night and initially choose this place on convenience.

We were pleasantly surprised at the quality and value. The bread was incredible. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Came to piada twice now and the first time I went I ordered the carbonara pasta with the parmigiano reggiano piada stick. To be honest, Piada was so hyped up during the time that I went, which was near the time of its first opening, that my expectations were too high and the food wasn't as great as I expected. I did hear some mixed reviews on the pasta from friends who've been there multiple times before me. 

This time around I came for its buy-one-get-one entree event. I ordered the summer lunch bundle which came with the Crispy Chicken BLT Tasca, a side of Roasted Corn Salad, and the Blackberry Hibiscus Lemonade drink all for $10.69. It was a great deal for the bogo because my friend also ordered the same thing. 

The Crispy Chicken BLT Tasca didn't look like how it was pictured on the menu but there was a good amount of meat so we let that slide. The crispy buttermilk fried chicken seemed a little bit dry so I wished they gave more of the spicy balsamic aioli sauce. I'm not a big fan of pickles but the pickles in this sandwich were pretty sweet and really added to the flavor of the meal. Overall, the sandwich was pretty filling so I was satisfied with the portion size. The Roasted Corn Salad tasted really fresh and is definitely a summer essential side. The side portion didn't seem as much as it was advertised though. And last but not least the Blackberry Hibiscus Lemonade. Ohmygoodness it was huge!! Definitely true to its size pictured on the menu. AND it was super tasty with a nice balance of sweet & tart. So delicious~~ 

I'd come back for another tasca sandwich :)"}
{"text":"Very good. 

Danielle and I had lunch today at Piada because I had a $9 credit. We'd been there before and thought it was ok but nothing special. i'm not sure what changed. maybe nothing. we both had something different than the first visit. anyway, lunch today was really good.
Danielle had the pasta carbonara and i had the Piada meatball w/ pasta. i chose the spicy diavolo sauce w/ some sauteed zucchini and mushrooms. the sauce had the perfect amount of warmth on both temperature and spicy. the meatball was also really good. 
i also ordered a piada stick w/ pepperoni and cheese which was delicious. to be honest, i can't wait to go back. i want it for lunch again tomorrow."}
{"text":"I love this place! You choose your pasta, your own sauce and then select your own toppings. There is such a large variety to meats and vegetables to choose from. They also have excellent salads. It's restaurant quality but the service is fast and friendly. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I love this \"fast food Italian\" place; however, I'm pretty upset that they got rid of their \"pick 2\" option. You used to be able to choose a smaller portion of pasta and a side salad but now they only have full sizes of everything. The flavors are delicious and the toppings are incredibly fresh. I got the pasta bowl with calamari with tons of fresh toppings and a drink and it was around $11. Pretty much the same type of place as chipotle for around the same prices. I've never had the actual Piada, the crepe-like wrap, but I hear it's very popular. 

All in all I will continue to frequent Piada for those times I'm craving an Italian meal out without having to sit down for it!"}
{"text":"Good place for greasy, quick carb cravings. Could be the chipotle of italian? They've taken to the new fad of bringing higher priced (quality?) cuisine (e.g. Bravo, Brio) to the masses in a more affordable medium, which is becoming increasing common in other parts of the U.S..

Good topping selections, though the staff here needs a lot of direction in terms of portion. Maybe most of the customers that come here like to have tons of sauce and not a lot of veges. That's just me. 

Usually get the pesto pasta. I like the new smaller size, though don't mind eating half of the large size and saving it for lunch the next day. The piadas are a bit too greasy for me, but manageable when sharing."}
{"text":"I had never been to Piada before but had noticed this location numerous times traveling for work.  I stoped last night on my way to the hotel. The food was very good my low rating is for the service.  I had ordered off of the menu and after much debate they stated that they did not have what I ordered as they were out.  My secondary decision was the pork sandwich which the counter worker had ordered more meat for my sandwich then prepared my sandwich with what was remaining in the bowl.  I had also ordered a meatball on the side which they tried to give to another customer numerous times.  I had also ordered a side of potatoes which I never received. When checking out they entered my order wrong and had to redo the entry. I was only one of two customers at the time so certainly not busy.  I finally attempt to sit down to eat and the counter worker approaches me to say that they forgot to add the meat to my sandwich.   Upon review they decided I didn't need more added.   The register worker didn't know what kind of teas or drinks they had to offer.  Most possibly the worst restaurant experience I have ever encountered."}
{"text":"Not sure why Piada has such poor reviews. We've been here many many times and the food has been consistently good.  I think a lot of customers who have posted reviews are a bit clueless and probably are posting 5 star reviews at Olive Garden right around the corner. We know good Italian from living in NYC for 15 years...


Meatballs are substantial and tasty (albeit a bit heavy on the breadcrumbs),  Italian sausage is very tasty and has a good bite to it. Lobster bisque, salads and  Italian sodas and great choices as well. With the pasta being pre-cooked I do wish it was prepared a little more al-dente...but let's call a spade a spade. This is \"street food\" and you sacrifice a small bit of quality to get your food instantly. 


My only gripe is about the clumsy assembly line \"make it your own\" type system. I think this could be refined as in large orders the staff seems a bit flustered.

Several times management has come out to check to see if we liked the food which makes me feel like they take pride in what they are doing. Not the norm 

So in short this place in reality should be a solid 4 stars. Ignore the other clueless yelpers dragging the rating down on this place"}
{"text":"Piada has become one of my go-to places for lunch. There may be a long line, but it moves rather quickly. I stick to the Diavolo pasta only changing up the protein every once in awhile. The Diavolo has a spicy, creamy tomato sauce. You can add your veggies as you please. I tried the Farmer's Salad once and it was delicious, but I can get a salad anywhere. The Piada sticks are very tasty; be sure to dip them in the Parmesan sauce. You can get the sticks with or without pepperoni. They introduced the blackberry lemonade which is delicious and comes in a large cup. I love love love the lobster bisque (it tastes better than Red Lobster's)! 

The food is excellent, but I want to take the opportunity to comment on the commitment to quality service. The staff will ask you how your day is going while preparing your order or waiting for an ingredient to complete an order. This is something I noticed in my last visit and really appreciated. This is not a common occurrence at most quick-service restaurants so it's a nice change up."}
{"text":"My friends and I met here a little before 7 PM on a weeknight and it was perfect timing! While there were others in the restaurant, we didn't have to wait in line very long and the service was fast! I got the Summer Lunch Bundle (even though it was dinner!). I got a side of the roasted corn salad, turkey pesto tasca and the blackberry hibiscus lemonade. It was all so refreshing and delicious! My friend and I also split a pepperoni stick, which was just as good! I look forward to going back and trying something else off the menu!"}
{"text":"For the record I like Piada. The one in Cleveland Hts is good. This location sucks! 

It's all about the service. It's awful! It seems like every single person that works there doesn't want to work there and therefore doesn't give a crap about serving you. It's all about the attitude and the interaction. 

Here it is, if you hate your job, get another one. If for some reason you can't do that, then find a way to have a better attitude so you can make it thru your shift. The customers don't care, we just want consistent friendly service. 

If you like Piada then you can eat here. Food is ok. Just know that you will get terrible service. Or go to the Piada in Cleveland Hts. It's just about 10 more mins down the road. 

Honestly, I've given this location a ton of chances to improve. Last nights fiasco of waiting for calamari and 1 meatball for 20 mins was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Had a really depressing meal from here, and I hope it was just a fluke because it looked so good online. 
Ordered from ubereats - all the pictures looked like these big stuffed sandwiches and this delicious colorful pasta and these big parm stick rollups...
Well, they didnt have our drinks and never called to tell us. So we had nothing to drink.
The cheese rollups were ONE. the pictures look like you may get a few, they'd be big and cheesey... maybe the size of a long fruit rollup and I could see straight through end to end - not a lot of substance.
The sandwhiches were awful. They were much smaller than I expected, and there was literally nothing in them! One piece of maybe half a chicken finger, a soggy piece of lettuce jammed in the back, you couldn't even see the sauce at all, or anything else... even the pasta, was just noodles with some olive oil. Nothing else.
We were so hungry, ordered $40 worth of food, and didn't even eat half of it because it was just bread and semi dry noodles.
Like I said, I hope it was just a new person in the kitchen or some weird occurance... really sucked. And man if you don't have something someone ordered, please tell them! Eating bread and pasta with nothing to drink is no fun."}
{"text":"This is like an Italian version of Chipotle. Ordered the proschetta and the meat was cooked really well and was extremely tasty. Also ordered a side of the lobster bisque which was absolutely divine! Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Piada does it again! Came back twice this week because I couldn't resist. Definitely the best fast food chain out there hands down. (Yes, its better than chick-fil-a people) this week I ordered the basil pesto angel hair with chicken and sun-dried tomatoes and the summer avacado Piada with steak. literally would pick both of these meals if I was on death row, if that says anything."}
{"text":"The wait was long and not that many people were in line. I liked building my own pasta bowl and it was okay. I feel like my lunch wasn't that memoriable. There were a lot of options to select from and I think that may be part of the reason why it takes so long for the food to be ready. I did like my food and I had a lot of leftovers. The food was fresh and the quality was also good."}
{"text":"Fast and easy. They have a new seasonal menu and the club was very good. I would however suggest to request light on the sauce as they tend to be heavy handed. 

The fountain area is kind of in need of some housekeeping and was not the cleanest. But not horrible. 

We were asked 3 times how we were and I felt that was a nice touch for this fast casual spot."}
{"text":"I've been to the 2 locations on the east side.   Beachwood area and Cleveland Hts. Out of the 2 Cleveland Hts is better in terms of cleanliness and customer service. Not sure what is up with Beachwood but the staff could careless about their job or your food. That's what it seems like. Now I've been to both locations about 10 times each. So I do know. I do not say this because I've only been there 2x. 

I gave it 4 stars not because of the issues but because I love the food. I can make my salad or pasta the way I want and add veggies and protein I feel like at that moment. And their are lots of really good choices. It's just delish. It Chipotle for pasta. 

I do have to say that I have never had the piata way. That's like an Italian burrito. But it looks good. 

So go for the food. Good and cheap. The rest doesn't matter. Your still going to like your options and your interaction with the staff will be minimal."}
{"text":"Just had Piada for the first time, delivered by Uber Eats. I ordered the Chef's Special with chicken fritte, no peppers. When I received it, it was full of peppers, even though the receipt had \"no peppers\" written on it. Not a total dealbreaker, as they were easy to pick out with a fork. Unfortunately, there was also no lettuce and it was supposed to come with some sort of spicy sauce, but the flavor was quite bland. Really didn't do it for me, and the whole time I was wishing it was a Chipotle burrito. The lobster bisque was delicious. Having said all this, I personally wouldn't choose to eat here again. I am leaving 2 stars because the bisque was good, and my husband loved his piada."}
{"text":"Honestly the customer service is fantastic! Was greeted by the man at the front with the dark hair and warm smile who always affirms my favorite piada, the fall steak avocado. Did you know it's also his favorite piada? The cashiers are also very nice. When I first heard of this restaurant concept I was apprehensive. I thought \" is this just another Italian chipotle\". BUT WOW WAS I WRONG ITS TOTALLY ITS OWN UNIQUE FLAVOR EXPERIENCE! Will be coming back soon to order the fall steak avocado piada"}
{"text":"Loved it.  Drove up from Broadview Heights to meet a friend here yesterday for lunch.  Really cool atmosphere- friendly staff.  Good value for the price.  Got the piada with the pasta bowl side.  Wonderful calamari and really enjoyed admiring the piles of toppings that you could add to it.  I did fresh mozzarella, diavolo sauce, arugula, spinach leaves, pancetta, eggplant pomodor,  grated parm and chose steak for the other one.  I felt a little bad for the line of people behind me, as it took a while to choose all the ingredients.  Next time I'll order online in advance to just go straight to the pick up station.  Another big plus is that they dispense free soda water!!  I love club soda and rarely does a place give it out for free.  I wish that they would open another one on the West side or down south by Broadview Heights/Brecksville.  I think it would do well here."}
{"text":"First time trying this place, had the balsamic salad with crispy chicken, it was very good, the Parmesan stick, it was delicious, a meatball, it was huge! And it was very tasty, my wife had a piada with.grilled chicken and arugula, which she loved, we finished it off with Italian berry soda an Cannoli chips! Yum! Highly recommend this place. There was a line. But it moves fast!"}
{"text":"Chef's Favorite and Blood Orange Tea were super fresh and delicious. Great flavors all around and the staff was very kind and seemed to love their job. I would highly recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"Kind of what you'd expect from any other assembly line-style chain restaurant: prices are low, service is fast, and dishes are customizable to what you'd like with them. Unfortunately, I didn't find anything about Piada to be all that special. Basically, your menu choices are wraps, salads, or pasta. For \"Italian street food,\" I didn't expect to see salads and pasta on the menu, but then again, I'm not entirely familiar with Italian street food. 

My husband and I both ordered pasta when we came, as it was dinner and we wanted something more substantial. All pasta dishes use angel hair, and I thought my pesto sauce and his carbonara tasted kind of similar. While the pasta was filling, nothing about it stood out. 

Overall, just average. Meh, probably won't be back with so many other options for good food in Oakland."}
{"text":"This place hits every point for cheap eats.

1) vegetable selection that beats Subway.

2) meat and meal choices that beats Chipotle.

3) side orders that beat your toilet in 8 hours.

4) all of above for under $10, depending on beverage.

The service has always been fast, friendly and the place is always clean.

The only negative is the construction site next door that makes the patio a dusty mess to suffer a meal on when the wind picks up.

My only gripe: we need more protein."}
{"text":"I have to be in Oakland for work from time to time and this is the spot to go to. It gets really busy around lunch time though, so always better to order ahead. The chefs favorite piada is really good! Although I haven't tried anything else other than the tomato basil soup, that of which I wasn't a big fan of. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Took it to go. Delicious! The staff was friendly but the options available adds a learning curve for the newbie. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tried Piada for the first time today and the food was great! I can see why people call it an Italian Chipotle! For anyone who has not ventured into a Chipotle, the way this works is you walk in and then either choose to order a creation off their menu or crate your own. You can do Piadas ( a flat bread type sandwhich, a pasta bowl or salad).
My sister and I chose pasta bowls and created our own. We each ordered the regular size because we knew in advance from other reviews you could reheat it well! 
Now let me say here that I wish the attendants had been more helpful. We stated quite clearly it was our first time and we were not sure how it worked... She simply stared at me. So I said I thought I wanted to do a pasta bowl and chose the regular size. I had to ask about the meatballs. She did not explain it was one meatball or anything. She just asked if I wanted anything else. I requested mushrooms but it seemed it mostly to be veggies not mushrooms. I then asked could I mix sauces and the new attendant just nodded so I chose the Alfredo and the regular red sauce.i added mozzarella and parmesan cheese and although I requested LIGHT creamy parm sauce the girl was very heavy handed. I tried to prefer the garlic knots and got a flat piece of dough caked in olive oil. It was ok but won't do again.
My sister got the pasta with a meatball and plain sauce with lots of mozzarella and Parmesan. 
The food is what got them the 4 star rating! That and the manager who walked around asking how things were so I shared my story with him and he was genuinely interested and said he'd do better training! We will try here again for sure and next time will be more prepared. I could only eat about half of mine and I am looking forward to my dinner!!!"}
{"text":"So I have to be honest, I have only tried a few things here. This is mainly because I am stuck on one item, their Farmer's market salad. It is so good and also only here for a limited time. I am going to be one sad person when they take it away. I swear, I will sometimes find myself craving it. It is grilled chicken, strawberries, avocado, candied pecans, grilled corn, feta cheese and a lemon basil dressing, YUM!!! Go try it before it is gone, seriously!"}
{"text":"I'm giving a 4 because I really do like the food. It insure wish the staff was a bit less assembly line and a little more informative.  I've been 2 times now and yesterday was the first time I took my husband.  Neither one of us had a clue what to do as far as ordering and told the counter help that.  We basically were met with blank stares.  We ordered a salad and a pasta, a side of calamari and a breadstick.  The first two people in line started our order and the first man asked the cook to drop our calamari.  We then stood and waited at the register for someone, anyone to finish our order while the line workers moved on to the next people in line. The cashier was MIA and when she came back we asked for the breadsticks, she turned and asked the cook and he went and pulled two trays from the fridge and said it would be 15 minutes.  I asked was there something wrong with the ones at the other end of the line?  Apparently they were pepperoni though they looked like parmesan from where we stood, (okay Nix the breadstick) how about the calamari.  She turned around and asked the cook about the calamari and he said he would cook them.  Okay (Nix the calamari) we've waited long enough my husbands pasta was now cold.

I am a fairly patient person, my husband is not.  The whole crew just seemed confused and the line was backed up to 14 people by the time we left.  There were two people in line when we arrived.

Maybe it was just an off day or new crew?  The best news is my husband really liked the pesto pasta with steak and with that I will drag him back in for another try!  My salad was excellent, fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"I like it.  It reminds me of another place called Gusti Italian Grill that was sadly only open for 4 months before it closed down due to poor management.  The food at Piada is great, quick and they have healthy options, just don't eat the actual piada.  The piada cheese stick has like 790 calories!!!  But the pasta and salad bowls are reasonable and tasty.  Kudos to this place."}
{"text":"Love Piada. This location is very busy, but the staff is very nice. I've gone several times and never had a bad experience. The calamari is perfectly cooked. It's really just delish. A must get is the orange Italian Soda. It's so refreshing."}
{"text":"My husband and I took my parents here after doing some fun things in Oakland, and what a cool experience it was! Just by observing how busy it was, from families to students, we knew it had potential. 

Honestly, there were so many items I wanted to try on the menu and of course was limited to one entree. After switching back and forth 5+ times, I settled on the Farmers Market Salad. When going to order, the concept reminds you of a Chipotle or Moe's. You give your order to the first staff member and he alerts the rest of the staff lined up on what is to come. Each member has their specific job and they all worked together so well, with an upbeat, positive attitude. 

By just glancing over the ingredients, it was evident that all prepped foods were as fresh as can be. From chicken right off the grill to roasted corn and homemade dressings, the selection was incredible. My salad was crisp and full of ingredients - the staff even allowed substitions when I stated my dislike for feta. It was large enough for two meals! My mother had the same entree while both my husband and father had the Pesto Pasta with added chicken - just as delicious! We topped the meal off with a pepperoni piada and a hibiscus tea drink. 

If you are interested in a modern, fresh twist on Italian, give this place a shot. I look forward to another excellent experience here. I will be back for a piada or tasca!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in for dinner at this new location in Northway. I was very excited to try Piada for a second time! I previewed their menu prior to going to view the fall and winter featured items. I settled on the Harvest Grain and Apple Salad. Overall, the salad tasted good. I had asked for no Feta cheese though I found several large chunks throughout the salad. There  were only two pieces of sweet potato and very few apple pieces, the heart and soul of the salad! It was drenched in dressing, a little too much for my liking. I enjoyed the ingredient combination, however a little more time was spent making it  would have produced a better product. 

The restaurant was clean and the employees were friendly. I will give this new location time to work out the kinks with their food and I will give it a try in the future!"}
{"text":"Don't get the calamari for some reason I can't enjoy it. All the other Piada sandwiches are great and try the cannoli chips Brand new open air seating!"}
{"text":"Tonight's plan included yoga at the CMOA....oops. I found myself at Piada instead! This is my second visit. The first noticeable thing is how friendly the staff is. They are genuinely kind, funny and helpful. I ordered the Mediterranean Power bowl with chicken. Ten out of ten. Pickled veggies, garbanzo beans, roasted sweet potatoes, quinoa and cauliflower topped with some kind of cilantro lime sauce- heavenly. I wish I had one closer to me to eat this every single day.  

While I didn't have one on this trip, the pepperoni rolls and made to order pasta bowls are also amazing. You can't go wrong here. It has something for everyone and it's all made to order! What can be better.

Parking garage right around the corner off Forbes to make your visit easier :)"}
{"text":"Piada isn't what you might expect, it's so much more! A convenient run on Italian food done fast, fresh and cheap. I give them 5 stars for their service, the value and the flavors, but I have to save my official 5 star rating for those ultimate experiences, ya know!? Choose from amazing salads, I've had the apple harvest or spicy Tuscan with or without the protein of your choice, or a burrito-like piada wrap done in many different styles, something like a Caesar wrap, or with their house marinara sauce, or try a big portion of their pasta, I've gone with pesto, spicy marinara and carbonara, which are all on pointhey also have alfredo. Any of these come in around 8 bucks each, and their big. 
There is an item that flies under the radar too, its on the sides menu. They're called sticks. They're basically tightly wrapped, cheese filled quesadilla-like wraps that are crispy and delicious, I still haven't gotten past the pepperoni one to try the Parmesan or garlic ones yet, but at 2.29 they're a must! 
This place rocks! It's super savory and cheap! Not to mention, this location does a great job at running a tight ship, even if the line is long you will move through quickly. Oh! And they have Italian sodas if you want to go the whole nine yards with your Italian experience. Keep an eye out for their BOGO coupons in the mail too!"}
{"text":"I have never had Italian Street food before, so this was a nice surprise!! I had the Mediterranean bowl and it was amazing. The green harissa dressing was everything."}
{"text":"In town for a short visit and decided to order in a late dinner through UberEATS. What a pleasant surprise I got with the food from Piada Italian Street Food. Obviously, I cannot attest to the restaurant location but the Farmer's Market Salad was tremendous! The combination of flavors was amazing and an awesome deal for the price. I was also pleased with the cannoli chips. As a former New Yorker, I wasn't sure what I would get but, they totally brought me home - the shells or chips were perfect and the filled was superb. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Got very sick after eating here. Will NOT be eating here again, approach with caution. Suspect rotten meat based on what doctor said."}
{"text":"The answer to Italian Chipotle concept has arrived in Cleveland!!! 

The decor is very basic and reminds me quite a bit of a Chipotle, except the walls are lined with subway tiling.  The menu is a bit more extensive with plenty of tasty options to choose from.  You have your basic piada (stuffed flatbread), pasta bowl, salad bowl or a you-pick-two style.  I usually get a you-pick-two since one is never enough for me haha ;)

Their protein options are amazing- salmon, calamari with hot peppers (DELICIOUS!), rosemary chicken (so good), steak, Italian sausage, crispy chicken or vegetarian.  The toppings and mixings are enough to overwhelm you!  The sauces- pomodoro, diavolo, creamy parmesan, basil pesto, red pepper pesto and creamy alfredo are all awesome.  I usually get a mix of basil pesto with the pomodoro and its SO good.  

I ham it out with the toppings; I particularly love the pancetta. The pancetta is thin and crispy and just adds another dimension to my rosemary chicken pasta bowl with pomodoro and basil pesto.  The food is more than enough to fill you with the toppings and pasta/salad/piada.

You MUST try a piada stick with the hot marinara and the calamari fritto misto.  I had a parmigiano reggiano stick- it was hot, gooey and oozing cheesy goodness.  I just started salivating writing this.  The outside of the piada is covered in a light dusting of crispy toasted parmigiano reggiano.  The calamari is very good, but it can be sometimes overwhelming if you bite into a whole hot pepper.  

The meal is slightly more expensive than you typical chipotle fan fare and the wait is a bit longer, but its well worth a try."}
{"text":"Piada was soooo good! LIke others said, a kind of chipotle concept but with italian food.  I got a chicken ceasar piada. Piada is like thin fried bread with cheese. It was big enough that I was able to take some home. Friends also got other piadas and loved them, and we also got a few of the parmesan sticks. Everything was great. They had some good kids options as well so everyone was pretty happy, though I think the boys mostly just ate the parmesan sticks.

Fast service and friendly."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but they are so unfriendly. The workers DID NOT want to be there at all. I was so shocked. I was almost embarrassed when I had to ask for a little extra cheese. It was an uncomfortable experience. It's unfortunate because they have a beautiful surrounding area and beautiful building and beautiful set up."}
{"text":"I'm updating to 5 stars because it just tastes too good and it provides a unique concept or offering in this market. I originally gave 4 stars because it didn't fill me up but now they are giving free featured items with the purchase of an entree. On top of that they are mailing coupons. Third I didn't realize the piada was only like $6 for some reason I thought it was $9. So it was not fair of me to subtract a star. This place deserves 5 stars from everyone. Staff is amazing and the food is very customizable. They will put any combination of sauce , meat, toppings on any item. Doesn't have to be exactly how the menu has it"}
{"text":"I have always loved Piada food. I must confess myself disappointed in this location. I can't really point to anything necessarily... the service was a little slow but not horrible. The restraunt looks okay... Compared with the Kettering Dayton location where service service is fast and friendly and the restaurant is always clean... this location falls short."}
{"text":"Wonderful concept with very tasty, freshly-prepared food at a remarkable price.  It's a winner.

The sauce portions are a tad small, but they ladle on more if you ask.  Good service with friendly attitudes, but I think the staff needs to understand the whole process a little better.

This will be a successful national chain soon."}
{"text":"Great lunch for those in Oakland! The lobster bisque was as good as any fine dining restaurants bisque I've had. Friendly staff and great service"}
{"text":"I'd probably give this 3.5 stars. It took a really long time. I was there by 11:10, so didn't think it would take very long, but was probably 20 minutes. I thought that so early I'd be okay, but it definitely took longer than other assembly line type places. I think it would need to be a little faster to really work as a quick lunch place in Oakland, but if you have time, or take a longer lunch than I do, it's worth at least checking out. And maybe some of the crowds will die down once it's been around longer. New places do always get packed in Oakland.

I got the chef's favorite piada with the crispy chicken and did like it. I'd like to customize it more another time, but thought that the food tasted good. Maybe a little bit salty, but it was decent, especially since there aren't many places to get wraps around here. Once everything was put in the wrap, the chicken wasn't crispy anymore at all. It might be different on top of a salad or a pasta, but I wouldn't describe it as crispy chicken. It was just breaded and got a little soggy pretty quickly.

It was meh. I wouldn't be against giving it another shot and trying one of their salads, but I wouldn't rush there."}
{"text":"Been going to this location since my sophomore year of high school, and today I got some not so brilliant service. I walk up to the line and told the young woman my order. I wanted to order two carbonaras, but she informed me they were out of alfredo sauce. Okay, thats fine. Then I change my orders to two pasta bowls. While deciding on the protein, she puts portions of chicken into each bowl. I became puzzled as to why when I asked for crispy chicken after the fact. I asked her, \"Did I say regular chicken?\" And she replies \"No, I don't think so.\" I proceeded to say, \"Well why did you put regular chicken in the bowls?\" And she snaps at me and says, \"You don't eat this chicken?\" While it's not my cup of tea, I get frustrated with her and kept telling her I did not order it. Then she proceeds to say she put it in there to make up for not having the alfredo; I was confused and flustered at this point where I said screw it (the protein was comped, but I would've wished she asked me instead of putting it in the bowl) 

While she was helping me, she was more concerned with chatting it up with her coworkers about clocking out; which gave me the perception that she didn't really care about helping me. I've been in the service industry for a few years, so I know the the struggle, but she should've been more considerate about the conversations she has in front of people.

Overall I think management needs to be more mindful of who they hire for customer-patroon interactions. Might take a little break from this location."}
{"text":"So excited for a delicious new fast casual restaurant in North Hills. 

We've tried several things on the menu and everything has been delicious. We're food snobs and really picky about good food.

My favorite thing is the crispy chicken. The chicken BLT is good and it's even better in the fall avocado. Yum! You never want them to end. My husband loves the porchetta as well. The basil pesto pasta was a little dry, but the steak was delicious. As for sides, the lobster bisque and the tomato basil soups are to die for. We love their Italian soda and tea selections. 

Try it out. You won't be disappointed. Service is great too. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"MaMa Piada!! -Awesome! Delicious & Unique. 
I get the Piada in a bowl. Nearly can't finish it. Load it up w almost every topping.  They're options are really surprising. Mix the Diavolo & Alfredo sauces.. Totally boss!!  Then when I eat out half the filling I wrap up the Piada and eat like burrito.. dipping into the garlic parm sauce!  Who needs Olive Garden?"}
{"text":"The ambiance is great, it wasn't very busy because we were early birds. You kinda need to know what you're getting before you're next up in line, though... be prepared to tell them what you want, and don't expect much assistance from the staff with your menu selections. I was hoping this would be an Italian variation on the Cava Mezze Grille theme, but was a little let down. The pesto angel hair pasta bowl, despite my loading it up with extra ingredients, wasn't very interesting, being pretty much just another big ol' bowl of pasta. Suppose I'd better try a power salad bowl the next time."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is absolutely amazing and, surprisingly, really affordable! The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable even during the lunch rush. I never feel like I'm inconveniencing them or am being rushed to order. I work at the hospital up the road and know how crazy restaurants can get in Oakland around that time. Not only that, but I know the clientele probably aren't the most patient (most of the people there at that time work in the hospital as well) yet they are all still so friendly! Definitely recommend going, and if I can give a suggestion, the Carbonara with calamari is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Chipotle with noodles. My wife wanted to go but I didn't see the appeal. It's wraps and noodles with a Chipotle/Qdoba set up. It sounds gimmicky. 

I'm really glad we went. It's a bit out of the way for us so it's not an every week place but if I've got free time this is definitely high on my list. 

I recommend asking for extra sauce, though. Two little scoops ain't enough."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful experience. I've been before and been fine but this time I got the grilled chicken with arugula, tomatoes, onion, and pesto and ended up getting the worst food poisoning of my life. Not only was I vomiting all night long but I was so physically ill I had to go get an IV at the local clinic where I proceeded to need to crawl to the bathroom. 

Never have I ever been as ill from food before in my life and I have spent multiple weeks in third world countries. 

DO NOT GO."}
{"text":"Great and convenient place to eat! This new place is like an italian version of chipotle. 

Great food, fast, affordable and very tasty!"}
{"text":"Ingredients look fresh and taste good. You can customize your salad as there are plenty of healthy options. You can order online and skip line for Express pick up. There is a $5 reward on your first order when you order online and join their rewards program. Simple, clean and affordable."}
{"text":"Similar to a chipotle, but instead with pasta. What more else could you ask for? This place is so delicious and the staff are very friendly. Get the diavlo sauce, it's so great. I would give this place more than 5 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Prices were not overly expensive. They had an online order which cut service for our party in half, that was a bit odd because the line stopped moving and all the attention was then on the online order. 

They have a good selection of yummy tasting drinks that you won't find just anywhere. 

The ingredients were delicious. You can pick from several options on their menu or create your own!

We got a small size as a nice mid day snack. 

Street parking just around the corner. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Everything they make is delicious down to the street food like piada sticks, which are fat wrapped in fat fried in fat served with fat dip. Garlic dough is my favorite snack and it kills vampires! Eat here."}
{"text":"I LOVED Piada when it first opened and I still really enjoy their food. They have really great quality meats and the pasta is so perfectly al dente that I can't help but crave their food every once in a while. The toppings are also really really great. They have multiple types of cheeses and the number of veggies makes sure that everyone can have a little something that they like. 

However, since their opening, the prices have gone up and the quantity of food has gone down. They used to have a get two deal - a small pasta bowl and a small piada. Now, you can only either get the pasta or a small piada with side salad. No more combining the two. Also, they used to have fresh mozarella! Not anymore (must be too expensive to keep). I don't like it when businesses seem to offer great deals and then take them away once they have lured in their customers. Would have really liked it if they could keep those great deals on their menu. 

Still, not a bad place to go for only 7 dollars."}
{"text":"This is like the Chipotle of Italian food. The pasta was alright, a bit dry, but they add a lot of sauce to offset that I guess. 

I like their concept, you can customize your Italian food, but for the price, I'd rather eat a burrito from Chipotle."}
{"text":"This review is only for Uber Eats 

The food came very fast and was packaged neatly. I got a wrap that had arugula, sweet potato, bacon, and italian sausage as an added meat for $1 more. The flavors were very complementary and pleasantly surprising! The ingredients were also very fresh.

The price was very reasonable as well, at $9.50 (+$4 for UberEats delivery fee)."}
{"text":"I liked the concept more than the food. Would give it a second chance though. The salads are good and the food is healthy so that's a plus. Staff is nice but young and not extremely helpful."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for a free entree...still cost me 6 dollars, no such thing as a free lunch. Fast food chain horse bull cocky."}
{"text":"This piada has been here for quite awhile and I used to love it. Now that it has become more popular I feel like they are slacking. They changed their chicken and it isn't as juicy as it used to be. They over cooked it. I don't like how they changed their student discount to just basically a free drink. It used to be a $5 regular bowl of pasta. But for the price it's still a pretty good meal. It's very filling. Despite what I've said it's still tasty. But I know it could be better. 
Other than that they have added to the menu. They added more items to add to your dish, like avocado. It's so easy to switch things up. I love the variety here. All in all I think it's a good place to get lunch or dinner. I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Another great fairly cheap restaurant that originates from Ohio. The ordering system is kind of odd but the pasta is really good."}
{"text":"My only update.... if you're watching calories - pay attention.  My girlfriend and I almost had a stroke later that day when we looked up our calorie intake from our lunches."}
{"text":"Visited piada's for the first time after seeing their grand opening posts on my facebook feed. Had the chef's favorite piada with crispy chicken. I actually liked it a lot! I got a free side of a parmesan stick after showing them the facebook event that you can get a free side. My friend got a small basil pesto pasta with steak. The sundries tomatoes in there were a tad salty but nevertheless delicious. She got cannoli chips as her free side. The chocolate chip cream they gave on the side had like two chocolate chips in there which was to my disappointment. The Parmesan stick wasn't as good as I expected but the entrees were delicious. I loved my piada wrap and I loved the few bites of pasta I snuck from my friend. The steak and chicken were both really delicious. The pastas and piadas don't come with any meat or calamari or anything like that from the start. You have to add it on for a few extra cents or bucks like $0.99 or $1.99, something around there. The waitresses and chefs were all really friendly and the chefs walked around as we ate constantly asking us how we liked our food and if we needed anything we could call them. :)) overall, it was a pretty satisfying lunch and I'd most likely come back!!"}
{"text":"The food here is extraordinarily. Pasta is fantastic, cook perfect every time. Vegetables are fresh and sauce is so good! Staff is very friendly. Chef Mike does a great job running Piada. He is very professional. That is why, I eat here three times a week."}
{"text":"Not sure what the big deal here is: it's pasta in a bowl with sauce and (for vegetarians) some sauce. It's good but $20 for two small bowls seemed a bit much. The staff is nice and the space is cool but its not a place Id go out of my way to eat at."}
{"text":"First off they are really slow.  Lots of empty tables and a line to the door, they need to figure out a way to move people through more efficiently. Not a good first impression.  Also the food was a pretty bland interpretation of of \"Italian street food.\"  I had the Alfredo and it wasn't really memorable.  I would love to give them another shot and to try a different item, if the line is ever managed better."}
{"text":"We have ordered on two occasions for take out and both times the food was great.  You feel good about the food you are eating and it tastes amazing.  Finally a restaurant that has food that actually tastes like real food!  Great options on the menu!"}
{"text":"Been here before normally it's a good time and staff is super friendly. Today was any other story the staff was kinda pissed and agitated and you could tell. The one girl in line that was going with blonde hair and I think she's new was super rude. Would roll her eyes every time I would ask a question"}
{"text":"Was good. Pasta could have been warmer. Steak and toppings were good. 
Staff could be a little more helpful. Was my moms first time and she didn't know what she was doing. Service at this location is lacking. 
Enjoy their Italian sodas!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for what I thought was going to be a quick dinner to bring back to my hotel. The line was pretty long and it was SLLLOOOOOWWWW!!! I don't know why the process is so slow. The staff don't really seem to have a process down and 1/2 of my order was ready while I waited for the 2nd 1/2 because they were behind in making bread. 

I had the pasta diavola (spicy tomato sauce) with scallions (strange for an Italian restaurant) and a tiny bit of shaved parm cheese (it needed a lot more!). The pasta was way over cooked and the meatball had a strange sponge-like texture. Other than spice - there wasn't much of Italian flavor. 

If you want something quick - skip this place (until they get their process down). I'm not sure if I'd try it again for dine in either. It's just underwhelming."}
{"text":"My roommates and I ordered from this place off of UberEATS. We had no idea what it was but we were so pleasantly surprised. This place was so good that I ordered it the next night! I ordered the Balsamic salad and it was extremely tasty and refreshing. I'm usually not a huge balsamic vinegar fan but this dressing is great. The salad had candied pecans and Granny Smith apples that really complimented each other. My roommate got the diablo pasta which he loved as well as the avocado wrap. That was good but not as tasty as the crispy chicken BLT Tasca. It has crispy pancetta on it which makes it even better. It's a little spicy but so good. The pesto pasta was good too! Nice flavors. I loved the sun-dried tomatoes on it. I'll definitely be ordering from here again. I wish I had picture but I was too excited to eat it."}
{"text":"The line is sometimes long but usually goes pretty fast.  Seating seems limited but forces you to get to know strangers.  I enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"I tried the Fall Avocado piada. It had great flavor but the portion size was small, I felt skimped on the meat and it was pricey for just a sandwich. ~$11 once you add meat? What a scam for \"street food\"! LOL. I would try a pasta - those looked like you got a lot of food for around the same price. Man these college kids around here are gonna be (even more) broke eating here all semester!"}
{"text":"Always get the large!! The large is an extra dollar or two, but is sooo much bigger and worth the price.

The lines can get long during peak times, but you can always order online. Piada is a great food option for local students because it is affordable, decent in taste, and quick if you avoid the line.

{"text":"Mouth watering quick made to order Italian street food. That was a mouthful yes? 

Piada oh piada, I had heard such amazing things from friends on the east side who had one for a while and finally they came over to Parma. 

For starters it's like chipotle for Italian food. They have pasta and salad and sandwiches, friend calamari, season entrees and wraps that they call \"piadas\". You can get any combination your heart desires or you can get an already pre-made dish. 

I had their seasonal porchetta sandwich with their seasonal grain side and my oh my it was a party in my mouth! The bread was honestly my favorite part, and their house made aioli MAMA MIA!!! Their side grain salad was filled with some fruits and veggies, nuts and some rice mixture. It was sensational. Their balsamic is literally to die for. I tried their friend calamari as well and it was a tad soggy which I'm gonna assume happened during transport because they don't use the right type of packing for it but hey it's all good. 

Literally my only gripe was that I had ordered online for a 6pm pick up, got their at 6 and my food was in the cook line, and I watched as one of the cooks let my \"hot\" sandwich sit there and get cold for a smooth 10 minutes before he noticed me giving him the evil eye and then decided to pack my food. Not sure what that was about. 

All in all it's a MUST try! Their pesto and Alfredo smelled and looked heavenly so I will be back!!

The staff is super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I went during their VIP Event. The place looked nice and the food was abundant and most important delicious. All the ingredients were fresh. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is simply enjoyable and brilliant, with super delicious food!!!
I am planning to come here once a week, and taste all its menu..."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Literally an Italian burrito. Spaghetti instead of rice, garlic flatbread instead of a tortilla shell, dice Italian tomatoes instead of salsa etc. It's an easy food to try and fall in love with as the ingredients aren't Bizarre."}
{"text":"Food was great! I was originally thinking about going to chipotle (cedar road location) but figured what the heck, I'll try this place out, and I'm glad I did. I ended up deciding on the pesto chicken pasta bowl. Filled me up good and hit the spot. It's a little pricey but well worth it in my opinion. Especially if you're deciding on between here and chipotle...prices are not much more. I'll definitely be back to try out the other items on the menu.

The staff and every one working here is super friendly and courteous, even when they are busy. It's refreshing :)

I heard their online ordering system is good, never tried it out though. Overall this is a nice place to come with your family and/or friends to grab a meal. Or just take out...which is what I did. Good atmosphere all around. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Now a fan after a second try!! 

First time, I got the pasta and wasn't impressed at all. It was definitely edible but was really nothing special and felt like something I could make myself. 

Second time, I got the Piada which was significantly better! I got the Summer Avocado one (seasonal) and it was definitely. Very filling without being heavy. 

Only thing to watch out for is long lines at lunchtime! I waited 30 min..."}
{"text":"Went in tonight for the first time and was blown away by the service. ALL of the workers had beautiful smiles across their face, I felt very welcomed. The fall steak avocado piada was recommend to me and I would give it a 12/10, SO tasty. The place had a great ambiance and with a fresh and clean feel to it. Prices are very reasonable and portions are very satisfying. Definitely going back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Listen i can't believe i haven't written a review here as this is by far one of my favorite places to eat. I've tried about everything on the menu at least once & i have never had a bad meal. My 2 favorites are the pasta Diavolo (this can be a tad spicy) & there calamari (I promise you'd think you were eating La Monts calamari). The place is always clean, everything always looks & tastes incredibly fresh & every employee I've encountered is always so pleasant & helpful. & get this...foods so good I'd drive into crazy Oakland traffic & spend 20 minutes finding parking just to eat here! (I know, GASP! Right!?)"}
{"text":"The concept of a fast food pasta was so weird to me, until I tried Piada! I love getting the pasta bowl with steak+pomodoro & basil pesto sauce. The portion size is also really, really big! A whole bowl lasts me about 2.5 meals. I've also tried the piada with calamari, but I think the pasta bowl is much worth the money. 

They're also doing online order now, so it saves you the time from waiting in the longgg lines."}
{"text":"The good: The food is delish and the atmosphere is really nice - great for a casual lunch stop. Everything seemed fresh and the staff was friendly.

The bad: You cannot make it out in under an hour. Hopefully it is just because they are new, however each time I try to go for lunch the line is out the door. I waited once and it took almost 40 minutes. The next time I tried to order ahead online around 12:15, but received an error that due to heavy volume, my order could not be ready until 1:30 - over an hour!

Bottom line: Good food and friendly people, but not conducive to the working crowd or the Oakland lunch hour."}
{"text":"The concept of Chipotle-style Italian food was good enough, but the staff behind the counter were comprised of 4 surly incompetent and/or lazy young women who were just standing around talking. I went up to the counter to order and they continued talking about their personal issues right in front of me for the longest time! Then, when the ingredient I asked for (red pesto) apparently ran out, the piece of work female just repeatedly kept squeezing hard (5-6 times) on the plastic bottle (nothing was coming out) instead of walking to the kitchen to retrieve more (she never succeeded in getting anymore out. I had one blob of pesto the size of my thumbnail. I couldn't even at that point). The restaurant wasn't even busy. Soo lazy!! The only reason I didn't immediately turn around and walk out was 1.) I was too busy thinking about what kind of reckless upbringing caused these individuals to turn into such terrible adults and 2.) I was ordering on behalf of someone who really wanted to try this place. Definitely will NEVER go back so long as those same females are \"employed.\""}
{"text":"This is such a great place! It is a very light healthy choice which still carries alot of flavor and is wholesome. Plus, the food is prepared fast, but not too fast to sacrifice quality! The piadas are a unique and awesome choice. They also have great drinks including some italian flavored sodas and a hibiscus lemonade that is excellent! Highly recommended as a quick, easy, dine in or carry out place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great concept, awful execution.  Pasta is so easy and this could be such a hit with better options, sauces and pastas.  They have 4 signature pasta dishes and will mix those up but if your create your own they dump the ingredients in a bowl and you have to mix it up yourself.  I want so badly to like this place because it's close and its pasta but it's lacking every time I try it."}
{"text":"Great concept and execution.  Quick Italian with quality ingredients and a nice variety on top.  I ate here a few times while my sine was born and everything was delicious.  Please open one in Robinson and this will be a go to for lunch and an emergency take out staple for dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered the pesto pasta with salmon and it definitely lived up to my expectations! The pasta and salmon were both very flavorful and cooked perfectly. My friends both got the diavolo pasta, which was very delicious as well, but if I had to choose, I would pick the pesto. I also really enjoyed the modern decor and look of the space. Cannot wait to try out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I have a friend with a Piada addiction so even when out of town, this was a place we had to stop for lunch. Not being all that familiar with the area it was a sure thing that we'd find something healthy that we'd both want to eat.

This is location is very similar to the ones I've visited in the Columbus area. You walk up on the right side, place your order, watch it be made (or get consulted on toppings), pay at the left side, and walk away to your table.

Tables and chairs are made of the same substantial wood and metal materials.

We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon (around 1:30pm) and it wasn't very busy. Our salad orders were correct and overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed my meal and how pleasant the staff were.  We ordered the Basil Pesto Pasta, Carbonara Pasta (both with chicken), Garlic Dough, Piada Sticks, and Cannoli Chips.  It was all delicious!  I didn't feel sick after like most lunch options in Oakland.  I was also full for the rest of the day!

Great option, worth a wait in line (as I've read in other reviews - we went at 1:30 on a summer Friday with no problems), and fantastic service!"}
{"text":"Although I am totally confused by their menu, I simply walk up to the order taker and tell them I want a small pasta w/the spicy sauce, sausage, grilled vegetables, sun dried tomatoes, red peppers and spinach, and then I have exactly what I want.  Sometimes what I order comes with a grilled piece of flat bread, sometimes it doesn't.  I cannot figure out that deal but I don't eat bread, ordinarily, so no biggie.  In short, this is an inexpensive place to get fresh pasta with lots of fresh toppings.  I love the food here--nothing fancy, probably most definitely not genuine Italian food, but heck, I love it.  I've been here at least ten times and  I've consistently gotten a very good pasta meal here and all for about $7.00 or $8.00.  I don't care to bother making pasta and buying all the fresh toppings at this price."}
{"text":"It is probably not the healthiest thing to eat but it taste so good there wraps are amazing especially their seasonal wraps that they have with butternut squash"}
{"text":"It's a very fast casual place. You walk in and they have menus right there and not above your head. You can make your own pasta or pick from a few speciality ones. They have sandwiches and can gets sides of meatballs or garlic breads. Definitely a different experience. Food was good just needed more sauce then what they give you. A lot of healthy and green options and the place was very clean and well organized. Just a little over priced for how much they actually give you."}
{"text":"Pretty much Chipotle, but Italian food. Adding pasta to a make your own piada (like a wrap) changes the whole game, especially if you get the parmesan Alfredo sauce! They brush the wraps with some kind of butter/oil and season it with pepper before filling it, so it's super flavorful. The lobster bisque is amazing too. I tried the seasonal fall piada with sweet potato, arugula, avocado, and thick pancetta bacon and it was great. Everything is pretty high in calories though so definitely not for those looking to cut carbs. But the service is great, very fast and the guy taking our order and prepping the wraps was doing fun tricks with his utensils just for entertainment."}
{"text":"I love it here. The food is so healthy and it's quick. I find the sauces a little spicy but that just makes the speciality drinks so much better. So good."}
{"text":"Amazing food as always. Italian chipotle pretty much. Food is always fresh  and very affordable. Whether you want a sandwich salad or pasta they have it....basil pesto is amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Italian for under $10!!! Can't go wrong. Imagine chipotle but Italian!!! Artichoke hearts fire roasted peppers feta red pepper pesto onions poada sticks with pepperoni or cheese Italian teas or peach Bellini's if your looking for a sweet ice treat during the summer days."}
{"text":"It really depends what you get with this place. I usually get a pasta bowl with chicken and then mix up my toppings and sauces. Occasionally, I receive a bite of bad chicken which is quite an unpleasant surprise. My friend got the basil pesto sauce and threw up because of it ten minutes after because of the extreme amount of grease that it contains. I had the alfredo sauce and felt sick shortly after as well. If your stomach can handle it, the food tastes good and the pasta is flavorful but a lot of grease is used."}
{"text":"First time customer, long time eater! I had the Steak Piada, Lobster Bisque Soup, and Calamari Fritto Misto. One word... Delicious! After demolishing the three platters I was left looking for more food. 4-star only because I have a big appetite. I'll be returning to try a Pasta Street Bowl."}
{"text":"I must admit when I saw Quaker Steak and Lube was being replaced I could have colored myself distraught...that is until I stepped inside this place.
Piada has a good amount of great Italian options and you get a ton of bang for your buck! For any of you who actually portion the amount of pasta you are \"supposed\" to have; their regular bowl is at least three servings and quite tasty! They do make their \"breadsticks\" and \"pizzas\" with something resembling a tortilla shell so you won't get as much value there but I hear the taste is still worth it.

The lines are astronomical at times because this place is still novel but things move pretty fast. Near the end of the day the \"breadsticks\" (tortillas with cheese and/or pepperoni inside) won't be freshly made which was a bit disappointing but still tasty.

For Dessert, there are cannolis not to die for and don't be fooled by the marketing of Italian Sodas... taste really isn't worth the price.

Overall, this place is a 3.5 for me but rounding up because so much bang for your buck, good service, nice amount of seating and pretty tasty."}
{"text":"The flavors/spices were really great! But the portions were too small for the price. I also wasn't impressed with the side options."}
{"text":"I'm sooooo happy Piada made it to Parma! Food was fantastic both times this week!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new restaurant. I stopped in for lunch, the line was long, but it moved at a nice pace.

However, I should have known it was going to be bad, when the manager was interviewing two perspective  employees, taking up a table during the BUSY time of the day that customers could have been using. And it was oh so lovely, to hear him discuss fecal matter on veggies, and that is why a popular Mexican chain restaurant was closed. Dinners do NOT need to hear about the sanitary practices of your location. The line was literally 2 feet from where they were sitting so you could not help but hear this. It was very inappropriate dinning room conversation.

I tried the pick two. I got the pasta bowl and lobster bisque.  When I sat down to eat, I found a hair in my pasta. The employees were very nice and made me a new pasta bowl. The Parmesan chicken was good, however the same can not be said about the lobster bisque. I specifically selected this item after reading about it on their website as one of their signature items. The lobster bisque tasted like a pumpkin soup with sandy mussels in it. There was nothing remotely lobster about this item. I took one bite and threw the rest out..

The person I was with, had the pick two as well, and selected the pasta bowl and salad. They were pleased with their selection, but not overwhelmed. 

The counter staff was VERY polite and friendly, but the food was just average. I was very underwhelmed by my dinning experience and most likely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great concept almost like a chipoltle with pasta and salads. Wish they had more pasta options though."}
{"text":"I'm a student at Pitt and this place is for sure a go to!!! They make the best piadas and their pasta is to die for. It's all made so fast and tastes so fresh. I just had my piada made by Jacob and it's amazing! Shoutout to Jacob!!! I suggest u all go when he's working."}
{"text":"Are you sitting down? Because what I'm about to say will shock you.  This place is better than Chipotle.  I got the Chicken Fritte Piada, with sweet and spicy peppers, this spicy red sauce called Diavolo, fresh basil pesto, sundried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, white beans, spinach, mozzeralla, and bruschetta tomatoes.  My dad got the Calamari Salad, calamari dropped in and cooked to order, he's a big boy and he couldn't finish it.  My brother got the Calamari Piada. Half way through eating our meal, we both smiled and said this place rocks!!! They both got the Piada pepperoni sticks.  Even the italian orange soda was amazing.  i wanna try the lobster bisque, and tomatoe basil soup. So many fresh options to load up on it seems endless.  They have meatball and pasta bowls. You can eat healthy, or your can indulge. I wish they had one in Strongsville, because it would crush with lines out the door.  Trust me on this one. I'll drop some picks my next time around."}
{"text":"Piada is a better version of Chipotle in my opinion. I like their toasted tortilla (crispy outside and soft inside). Depending on what you choose the amount can not be enough. I like their summer special, I hope that next season special is also delicious.
Because is a new restaurant, open kitchen/atmosphere is cool and modern."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, but..

Alfredo sauce was both heavy and tasteless; pasta tasted like mush (NOT al dente)

Also, the just-washed pans in which they mixed the pasta had soapy water still in them.

It's like the opposite of a hole-in-the-wall: looks great, but the food stinks.

If franchise management is reading this, good idea, poor execution."}
{"text":"It is amazing food for the price! You get enough food that you will have another meal later on! I love the concept of this place more than chipotle! The different veggies and toppings are awesome. There are many different pasta sauces as well, which I mixed and had a few different kinds. The soda fountain has your traditional soft drink options, and there is an Italian soda fountain as well! I love the Italian sodas! What a cool feature. It is a tad chilly inside there every time I've gone... However in summer I'm sure I'll be glad! Can't wait to visit again soon!!!"}
{"text":"Foods have everything. I personally feel it's too salty. If you like fast food kind, this may be it. I think you can spend a little more in Pittsburgh with really authentic foods."}
{"text":"Love it!! Like Chipotle but Italian and pasta. Delicious every time with lots of variety"}
{"text":"Great concept. Really like the atmosphere and they have great Italian sodas and a good menu. I ordered the spicy pasta with calamari. The noodles were sitting in a giant bowl precooked and are reheated when you order them. This gives them a rather playdoughy consistency. The calamari was nicely cooked but had a weird artificial tasting lemon powder on the outside. I think I would have really liked it if I got the wrap. Definitely will stop. Ack to try it."}
{"text":"Best chicken salad ever. I got the balsamic salad and added chicken. Every bite was amazing. Now I am obsessed i get it all the time. But need to try other stuff. Everything looks amazing."}
{"text":"Saw that this place had just opened this past Monday and really wanted to try it out as I'm currently on rotation in Oakland. Finally got a chance to pop in today. Unsurprisingly, as this place is currently on the rise (trending since it is new - literally it's still in its first opening week) and I went during the lunch rush (when people are usually on break, either from work or classes), the line was pretty long and translated to a 20-30 minute wait. I do really appreciate that the staff observed this and attempted to make things go faster by passing out menus to those in line and made themselves available to answer any questions customers may have so that by the time you do get up to the front to order, you know what you want for sure instead of standing there taking precious time up to decide. From what I overheard from those in line, this restaurant (chain) has its roots in Ohio and quickly rose to prominence from there. The restaurant concept is mainly based on the piada, a Italian-style type burrito that has its roots in Italy (hence the name), but it also serves other Italian-related options, such as soups, salads, pastas, and so forth. I decided to try a seasonal item called the Fall Steak Avocado Piata, which consists of a piada shell and a rather delightful combo of steak meat, arugula, pancetta, avocado, spicy balsamic aioli, mozzarella, pepitas, and butternut squash. I ended up also adding calamari to it since I wanted to evaluate its quality along with three sticks (Parmigiano Regiatto, Pepperoni, and Garlic Dough Piada sticks). The piada itself was wonderfully made. Ingredients are fresh and the combo that was included in the particular piada was well-thought out. The steak meat was cooked well, fresh, and juicy, which I really liked. I also found the calamari to be of decent quality, not overfried to the point where you feel guilty eating something potentially unhealthy but also not to the point where there is no taste to it. All in all, my mouth felt wonderfully happy and satisfied biting into the piada and all of its wonderful flavors that went well and complemented each other impeccably. The sticks were also pretty good and are excellent sides to complement should you be feeling really hungry. Overall, it was well worth the wait even if the wait was longer than I would have liked. In general, I would recommend going in the early afternoon when not so many people are on lunch break and perhaps the later dinner hours to avoid the dinner rush. The best way I could succinctly describe this place is Chipotle-like Italian style cuisine. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is a great concept - bright and nice inside. The line cooks were great and friendly. The food meh, average at best. Price, cheap. We had the pesto pasta...I had salmon on top and my daughter had chicken. We were kind of sick of it halfway in and ended up throwing it out.  Disappointing as we were quite excited. I'd maybe go back and try something else but there are so many other great places."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for some time, just had not had the opportunity.  I must say that it exceeded my expectations.  I'm usually in the area on the weekend when Piada is extremely crowded and therefore didn't have the desire to stop.  I was in the area on a weekday afternoon and took advantage of the opportunity.   I reviewed the overhead menu and opted for the angel hair pasta with the Pomodoro sauce.  The pasta was warmed in a sauce pan before adding the sauce, I chose chicken, white beans, parmesean and a number of other fresh toppings. There was also a salad and wrap option. The serving size was more than generous.  I was pretty impressed, everything was fresh and delicious.   I had previously purchased a $20 gift card on-line and received an additional $10 gift card for free.   My meal was approximately $7.00 which was a DEAL.  I can't wait to return and use the remaining value on my gift cards!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Amazing  food that is so fresh it seems like they just came from the farm. The salads and wraps are very creative. It is hard to choose which to get. I hope they open in Cranberry !  I wish they had dessert."}
{"text":"Chef's favorite piada tastes too salty because of two layers of sauces and the peppers. It would be great if it can be less salty. Otherwise, great vibe and environment! I would definitely come back to try the salad too."}
{"text":"I was really surprised with this place! In my opinion, Oakland is not known for it's amazing food. I find that it's mostly chains and there are a ton of bagel places.. lol. Piada is a chain, but it's new to the area- I have never seen one before. My colleagues and I came here for lunch yesterday around 11:50 am. There really wasn't a line, which was a pleasant surprise. I went with the summer lunch bundle- turkey pesto tasca with the roasted corn salad and the blackberry hibiscus lemonade. The staff were all so friendly and incredibly efficient. I can imagine that they can get through a pretty long line for lunch quickly. The lemonade was really tasty and the tasta was delicious! It was so fresh and just packed with flavor. The roasted corn salad was good as well. I left feeling not overly full, but really satisfied. I would definitely go back for lunch again!"}
{"text":"Out of this world good. Price is very reasonable, most things under $9. Great switch up from Chipotle, Qdoba, etc. Overall"}
{"text":"I came back again this week and the diavolo was definitely very spicy! I think the amount of sauce can vary each time, because I remember thinking the pasta was slightly dry last time, but definitely not this time. I also tried the meatball instead of crispy chicken this time - it's literally one giant meatball! It was very mushy and did not taste like much, and I was disappointed because of how good I remembered the crispy chicken to be. I would suggest to stay away from the meatball.

The lines were still really long, maybe because I went during lunch time, but I would still recommend ordering online if you can."}
{"text":"I've been to Piada once. ONCE. And that's enough. This is overpriced cafeteria food. Chain restaurant crap. A limp salad and clumped up pasta for $15.? In Cleveland? When you can get way way better authentic homemade food  for half the price? Yeah I don't need to come back here."}
{"text":"Amazing Piada! I got the fall avocado Piada with chicken. The sweet potato inside the Piada is such a great addition. It was so delicious! I ordered through ubereats and it was quick and packed well! Loved the blood orange tea as well !"}
{"text":"My first visit here was a major success! The 'faster-food' model seems to be taking hold in Oakland, and Piada is a great addition. The line cooks / staff were all very friendly and it was clear that the chef was in training mode and was great to his staff members (something I pay attention to and appreciate when I see it). 

I tried the Farm Club Tasca and added the Seasonal Harvest Grain side - plenty of food for lunch, but so good I couldn't stop myself from finishing it all! The Harvest Grain was sweet, spicy, and all around delicious. I will definitely be getting that again! 

The Farm Club had great flavor and I loved the spicy balsamic aioli and avacado and the pancetta was cooked to perfection! All of that with buttermilk fried chicken on a light wrap made me a very happy lunch customer! All of that was around $9, so it's less or on-par with most of the other local places and from what I saw, might be a step above! 

I'll be back, Piada!"}
{"text":"Was there tonight and had the meatball pasta bowl. I was looking forward to eating this, unfortunately the meatball itself was a little disappointing to me. I was hoping for a strong garlic and basil flavor but instead the meatball was heavy on breadcrumbs. The pasta and toppings where very good as usual."}
{"text":"The pancetta sandwiches we had were so fatty and the sweet potatoes were not thoroughly cooked plus they were cold. Furthermore, even after telling the cashier it was a takeout order, I was charged tax. The meal was 9.98 for two and I was charged $21.96 and I wasn't given a receipt. I thought it may have been put in the bag, but it wasn't. In addition, even w/tax it should have cost $21.58, not $21.96. No return customer here."}
{"text":"I like this unique place. Decor is clean and cute, love that they stay with the Italian theme with cute logo and font. Different from a typical quick food place. Salads are very very good with delicious dressing options. Pasta came be fabulous as well depending what you add to it, sometimes it mediocre. The pizza sticks are crispy yet soft-it's so confusing how they do that tastiness! My fav part for sure. Depending on location it depends on your experience-this one is very nice!"}
{"text":"I loved it.

It was modern and clean and had good food. Like a high end Italian Chipotle.

I got the Lunch Bundle which had a corn salad, Tasca sandwich and giant blackberry lemonade.

Would definitely recommend this place and wish there were more locations.

I went back the next week and tried more food."}
{"text":"Eh. Long wait for some pasta that was a step up from Noodles and Company. Not bad just lacking severely in flavor. I had a side grain salad that was interesting but also disappointing."}
{"text":"I found myself with time to kill in this neighborhood yesterday, so I grabbed lunch at Piada. I didn't know what to expect from \"Italian Chipotle,\" but had a solid experience.

I'd actually liken it more to QDoba, because in addition to the create-your-own options, they have pre-designed options. I tried the calamari fritta misto piada, and was really pleasantly surprised with how good the calamari was! The sauce and peppers were good as well. My only complaint is that despite being tasty, the wrap itself fell apart very quickly; I saved a lot of calories eating half fork-and-knife style so it was a blessing in disguise, but would've been disappointing if I had really wanted to eat it burrito-style (or had gotten it to eat on-the-go).

I paid under $8 for a generous amount of food, the restaurant was clean and the employees were friendly. If I lived in the area I could probably be a regular."}
{"text":"Another 5 star worthy establishment so far during my visit in Pittsburgh. Came here for the pizza rolls and they were so delicious. I also loved their deconstructed cannolis! Very clean and modern atmosphere. Love this place."}
{"text":"I think I've found a new favorite place in PGH! I drove by the other day & was reminded of Eataly so I knew I had to stop! My hubby & I made a point to stop in Oakland on our way home. And I'm SO glad we did! From the moment I walked in and saw Italian sodas on tap I knew I'd be in love! 

I got the chef's choice Piada, and it was honestly amazing. Like an Italian burrito, but so much better than that even sounds! The peppers were sensational & not something you find a lot at fast food places like this! The little cheese bread thing they add in your bag may have been my favorite part. The olive oil and cheeses were top notch, you could just tell!

Everything single staff member we interacted with was friendly and knowledgeable!

I've literally told 15 people about it already and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get pasta.. when it's made right. Sometimes the service is slow .. really slow.. along with always being out of pepperoni sticks. I make the 20 minute drive out here at least once a month sometimes it's twice in  a week but for the last 5 times I've came they have been out of them! Other then that I love the food here, managers usually keep the pace up. Some of the employees are very nice to my group and I just wish the place was a little more in order! Other then that food is great, would eat here more if i lived closer!"}
{"text":"The next in \"Chipotle for [blank]\" restaurants that I've been to, Piada does pasta. Yummy pasta, I might add.

The Piada brand is a step above the Panera-Chipotle tier of fast casual dining and above the TGI Friday's-Applebee's tier of food quality. The portions are massive, fresh, and truly tasty. In fact, the only questionable thing I ate was the garlic bread, which was more a tortilla with garlic butter on it. It wasn't for me. 

However, while the food was good, you should be warned that it doesn't come cheap. Piada is a treat for a special occasion. Even worse, the prices aren't posted anywhere. When we reached the register, we were slapped with a bill that caught me off guard. It's not necessarily unaffordable but I wouldn't make it a weekly stop."}
{"text":"people like this place because its different than what you normally see.  i will tell you that it's an italian version of chipotle.  my favorite choices are the salmon and the chicken.  the sauces...be warned...every one has an immense volume of garlic in it.  so unless you plan to mouthwash and brush your teeth afterwards...be prepared to reek of it.

i LOVE the piada sticks.  however, the service can be underwhelming, and the fact that i had to go back TWICE because i ordered a parmesan piada stick and got pepperoni both times before the right one disappointed me.  i probably won't go there again."}
{"text":"I tried one of their pasta/noodle menu and I honestly think it is not so much different from noodle company quality. For its quantity and quality, the foods are a bit pricy. 

But it is served fast (as fast as chipotle), and restaurant itself is quite spacious."}
{"text":"Workers rush even when the line is small, asked for a dressing and another worker snatched the bowl and put the wrong one in because she was hurrying and then told me \"it's exactly the same if you mix it.\" Didn't want to be that jerk that makes them make a new one so I said it was fine, but it's honestly nasty. If the worker hadn't been rushing she wouldn't have made an error. Then my friend went in line and paid and they overcharged. Whoever manages this place needs to reevaluate it's workers!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Combining the fast casual concept with Italian food was a fantastic idea and Piada executes it so well. I got a Piada, which is basically wrap. The wraps are made with a homemade, fresh \"tortilla\" that is so delicious and really elevates the whole Piada. The Fall Avocado Piada has sweet potato, arugula, pepitas, cheese, a spicy sauce, pancetta, and probably a few more things that I can't recall. I also added grilled chicken to mine. It was so flavorful...every bite was so good. I can't wait to come back and have it again. My husband had the Power Bowl which is a quinoa bowl with a mix of cauliflower, broccoli, sweet potato, etc. it also had a pesto sauce on top so the bowl was extra flavorful. He said he really enjoyed it and would come again. The pricing is comparable to other fast casual places and everything is customizable. Add ons like salmon are super reasonable too. Our friend added salmon to her pesto pasta and it was less than a $3 up charge for a big piece of salmon."}
{"text":"I am so sorry I tried this. Aside from the hair in my \"piada stick\", the pasta sauce had little to no flavor. The chicken tasted like week old left overs and the \"Italian soda\" tasted like it was orange crush labeled wrong. I debated on bringing what I didn't eat (everything) to my dog, but I wouldn't punish my dog with this food."}
{"text":"This is quick Italian food delivered Chipotle-style, which seems to be a trend these days. I'll give extra points for service, cleanliness, novelty, large serving portions, value for money, and environment/decor. The food itself is average but worth my while for a quick take out order if I wasn't in the mood to prepare dinner. This all boils down to 4-stars overall."}
{"text":"My review is based on a delivery order. I have yet to visit the restaurant itself. 

Soooo, it's 6pm, I have a ton of homework and I don't want to put on pants. I logged onto Uber Eats skimming through places I have and haven't tried. I decided on Piada tonight, because the pics in the photos looked banging. 

I ordered myself the carbonara with chicken, small diavolo with meatball, two sides of meatballs (my kiddo is a fiend for meatballs), and the blood orange tea. 

The blood orange tea was the only thing I found remotely delicious-- which is extremely disappointing. 

The pasta to sauce ratio is ridiculous. You get a huge bowl of angel hair and maybe half a cup of sauce? Wtf? Pancetta on carbonara was burned to a crisp, the sauce itself was oddly sweet?, and the meatballs are like a meat paste? There's no texture or flavor. Just a straight up ball of meat paste. 

My kiddo seems to like his diavolo, but the sauce on that was weird too. Tons of noodles and very little sauce. 

At least the food arrived pretty fast tho, and you can tell the ingredients are fresh and not sitting around (spinach, tomatoes, other veggies, etc.). 

I'll definitely give this place another try in person, but definitely not anytime soon. Too expensive for such disappointment."}
{"text":"Piada is okay... There are no other \"decent\" pasta places around the Oakland area so I go here whenever I'm craving Italian food. 

Their basil pesto and carbonara pastas are usually pretty good. All of their food is hella salty however - so have a cup of water ready to chug as you're eating here. 

Their lemonade is pretty bomb though - I'll give them that! Would recommend if you're desperate for quick pasta."}
{"text":"As a pasta lover, I had high hopes for Piada. While the Piada stick was scrumptious, I was really disappointed with my pasta. 

Angel hair pasta isn't my favorite and I wasn't in love with Piada's parmesan alfredo sauce. Mix that with sub-par chicken and you've got the Piada pasta street bowl.

On the bright side, I enjoyed Piada's open and casual atmosphere.

Admittedly, I've only visited Piada once, so I may have to give it another try in the future. But for now, I'll stick to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Yummy and fresh salads you can build, along with suggested ones that sounded pretty good.  They have both healthy and unhealthy options for couples like us who don't necessarily have the same eating patterns. I think a kid could do well here too.  The space is nice, more upscale than I had anticipated, and the chef was super friendly. I would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from this place. NEVER ever going back ever!! Nastyyyyy. And I am positive it was was this  place because this is the only thing I ate."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the last couple of months. I would say each time was a solid 3/3.5 stars. The ordering process is similar to Chipotle or Qdoba. Each visit, I start with a bowl of pasta (angel hair) bowl with either chicken or beef.  The meats are pretty similar to what you'd get at Chipotle or Qdoba. However, I feel that they tend to cook their steak more well done than Chipotle. You then get to choose your sauces. They offer mariana, alfredo, and one I usually get the diavolo sauce; which is a spicy marinara sauce. I tend to load the bowl with veggies. But sometimes you only get a few pieces of each type depending on the server and you'd end up digging for your favorite veggie in the bowl. The pasta itself is pretty good. It's cooked well and then lightly stir fried with olive oil and spices. At the end of the line, you get a bowl with a huge portion of food. I usually can't finish in one sitting.

For under $8 for most of their pasta bowls, it offers a great alternative to places like Chipotle, or Panera. It's hard to say if I'd choose this over them, but if I'm craving carbs, this place is great!"}
{"text":"Such great food concept. Cannot be fresher. No microwave or freezer. The combinations of flavors leaves you craving to come back and try making other combos. The piadas seem to be the speciality. It was incredibly colorful and fresh. The greens were tasty crisp. One of the best quick eateries in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile. Its Italian Street Food, whatever that is supposed to mean. Let me clarify: Think Chipotle meets Macaroni grille. Its Italian food in a burrito or a salad. You can also order pesto spaghetti. They have lobster bisque soup and canoli chips.  You wait in a line and order just like you would at a chipotle. Add a nice little touch: They serve wine and Peroni as well as Italian teas and soda. The girl put iceberg lettuce  in a calamari piada instead of romaine. Nobody seemed to notice. Minus half a star. The staff are neatly dressed in aprons. The staff is enormously helpful and attentive. Its fast food casual dining. Clean bright and freshly maintained. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is okay.. There are very little options for your pasta, only one choice of noodles & three options for sauces. There are almost no vegetarian options .. At this location the service was not great.. This place could use a lesson in customer service .. I payed $38 for mediocre food.. You are way better off going to a traditional Italian restaurant.. the best part of this place is the selection of teas and sodas.. step up the game piada"}
{"text":"First time here.  We got  a pasta dish and an entrée salad.  Food was prepared quickly and staff was very friendly. Our food was hot and fresh and comparable to what we've had in finer Italian restaurants. Will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I've raved about the original location in Columbus, was hoping for great lunch here.  

Maybe the cold dining area, created by high open ceiling, put a chill on the entire experience...

Lobster bisque with nary a hint of lobster (unless those genuinely tiny bits count) is a real problem.  Everyone was happy with everything else."}
{"text":"Quick, easy, tasty fast food. Much healthier than typical fast food, though. I don't come here often because their prices are too high for what it is. Most menu items are around $8 for the regular size portion. I think the menu is very clear and understandable. There are a couple of ingredient combination choices on the menu, or you can choose to build you own salad, pasta or piada. Very straightforward. And every topping is visible as you go through the line to order, so there should be no confusion as to what you are getting. The portion sizes are pretty big, as long as you choose many items, and so far I havent been told that anything I wanted cost extra. A big plus in my book. 
The interior atmosphere is really nice too. It's got an upper scale feel to it and the place has always been clean every time I've been there. Parking is always available and usually the line to order isn't long, at least at dinner time. They also have a nice little patio for outdoor dining in the summer!"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised. Fresh season food for a good price. Very flavorful! The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the soft opening earlier this month and we've already been back a second time. The food is excellent. 

I'm a sucker for spicy food, so I always go for the diavolo pasta, while my husband likes the carbonara. We both like the regular and crispy chicken. The pasta isn't drenched in sauce and nothing tastes like it has been sitting in a freezer for goodness knows how long. 

The portions are large, the staff is friendly, and the service is quick. Everything is easily customizable and the ingredients are fresh. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for the VIP Pre-opening event. I got the Chef's favorite piada with calamari and it was delicious. I wasn't expecting them to give me so much calamari in it since I got it for free, but they didn't skimp at all! The food is flavorful and the staff is friendly and helpful as many customers who have never been to a Piada may not be familiar with the food. Prices were super reasonable. Like many people said, it's sort of like a Chipotle for slightly more unique and casual Italian foods. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I give three stars instead of my typical four, because of some of the confusion that a couple of workers had on their faces and acted. The food was just as good as the first time I ate there. The first time I didn't go myself. The lighting was kind of a dinner setting, good for small families, there were three of us and the bill came to about $25-30, with drinks and a side of garlic flat bread, that wasn't the greatest, not worth getting in my opinion. Everything was over all delightful and pleasant."}
{"text":"One person described it perfectly \"Italian style chipotle\" but the gods is a lot better. I ordered a pita at tomato soup/w drink $12.50 and it was worth every penny. My friend ordered the cannoli chips w/ chocolate chip cream cheese. They were amazing."}
{"text":"Very very greasy.   Everything.   Otherwise it's low quality especially those pizza roll ups

Very cold ambience inside. Not a place I felt comfortable 

They are lucky to have customers!

It's not freshly done"}
{"text":"Came here for the pre-opening VIP event and would definitely go back.  It's a fast casual style joint that reminds me of Chipotle - except Italian and with fewer decisions as you are going down the line.  They have a few choices each of wraps (piadas), salads, and pastas plus a few seasonal selections and sides.  The standard ingredients for each choice are listed on the menu, so you select what you want, pick your meat, and watch them assemble it - you don't need to provide further direction unless you want it specialized in some way.  

The place is shiny and new - modern, but with some rustic touches to soften things up a bit.  There are several communal tables, booths, and regular tables throughout.  Staff members were super-friendly and plentiful for the event.  Smiles all around and a willingness to explain, assist, adjust that you don't find everywhere.   

I ordered the fall special piada.  It was absolutely delicious on a seasoned wrap that was freshly warmed and filled with steak, butternut squash, etc.   I appreciated that the arugula was used sparingly - so often, wraps are stuffed with lettuce and little else.  The balance of ingredients was good and it was enough to fill me up without a side or anything.  I also sampled the soups, some sort of cheese bread, and the fall side selection.  The fall side selection was top notch - flavorful and hearty, but not heavy.  I didn't care for the other two, but it could have been that they were samples on a tray that sat a bit.  

The other thing I didn't care for was the carbonara with grilled chicken that the boyfriend ordered.  The portion was ample, but I'm not sure \"carbonara\" is really the right description for this dish.  It was more of a bland alfredo with a bit of bacon added.  And it was really dry - the pasta to sauce ratio wasn't right.  Skip that and go with the wrap.  Add some Italian peach tea and you have a meal."}
{"text":"I would give it 4 stars but there are a couple bad apples working there. Why is it that I always get an attitude when I come in there? You're a cook! Just shut your mouth, smile and make my food that I'm paying for. It's your job! And it's very easy non skilled employment. There's nothing worse than coming in excited about the food and getting a meal only to be ticked off by some angry employee who hates his job. I'm sick of it. I'll wait longer for good fresh food but I won't tolerate bad attitude employees any longer. Shame on the managers who keep letting these people continue working there."}
{"text":"I went here while visiting some family in Pittsburgh. It's set up like an assembly line style restaurant similar to chipotle. You can order off their menu or customize your own meal item. The wait for your food is very short and the staff that makes your food is very nice. 

Starters:
I ordered a pepperoni piada stick  or what they call a \"pepp stick\" which is a piada  hand-rolled filled with creamy parmesan, 15 pieces of pepperoni, and parmesan on top. It had a nice crunch on it and you could taste the pepperoni on each bite

I also ordered the garlic dough with is the piada dough mixed with mozzarella and EVOO. Very light and tasty! Goes well if you dip in marinara!

I saved the best starter for last! Their calamari is honestly some of the best I've tasted. The batter that was used turned out nice and crunchy. It was airy and a tad salty. The squid was cooked perfectly. If it's overcooked it gets very chewy. They fry it with some of their peppers as well. Get this every time!

For the main items I ordered the Italian trio tasca which is a piada dough layered or folded on itself filled with fresh Italian ingredients. The spicy balsamic aioli inside was delicious!

For the last item that was ordered was the Tuscan piada. It is a piada rolled into a burrito form. All of the hand-rolled piada start off with vegetarian items but meat can be added. This was very tasty as it Is!

This place recently opened up and is a must go to spot!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my quick meal at Piada!  I love Italian food and always love a good, quick fast casual Italian joint.

I ordered the basil pesto pasta with crispy chicken.  They use delicate angel hair pasta for all pasta dishes, which was very tasty.  They add on alfredo and pesto for this particular dish, followed by sun dried tomatoes.  I added crispy chicken for an additional fee.  Finally, they topped it with mozzarella.

I was really happy with my meal and thought their pesto was delicious.  The crispy chicken added some nice crunch.

I didn't initially realize I could customize my own dish, but likely will in the future if I had a better view of my topping choices."}
{"text":"Currently wishing that there was a Piada's in my area because this place was really good. We were new to ordering here so a little explanation would have been helpful. The basic idea is you order off of their menu, which has a small handful of offerings between sandwiches, pasta, and bowls and then you go through the line (similarly to a chipotle) and customize your order. I got the Mediterranean bowl and added a protein. I wasn't sure if I was allowed to add anything else, some feta would have been nice. But I kept it simple and only added the chicken when asked. Salmon would have been another great option. Everything about my meal was delicious. The dressing was a perfect topping and the quinoa was cooked really well. All the vegetables were roasted perfectly. Other highlights from my parties order included a chef's special with the salmon, the meatballs, and pasta - with pesto. The experience was a little overwhelming when ordering as it seemed a bit chaotic and there are lots of specific sayings the staff have to use. They had a hype man (manager?) who cued the staff along the way. They also have really great drinks aside from just regular fountain drinks. The bathroom at this location is really small though. Like super small. 
But definitely check out their food, it's the quality and flavors that stand out."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Perfect for those days you don't want to wait so long at an Italian Restaurant. The food is all fresh and made to order. Their pastas are amazingly fresh and tasty! I wish their meatball was an all year round meal, but it is only seasonal. I always get either the alfredo pasta or meatball and they are both very tasty. My husband loves the calamari piada which does taste pretty awesome. Great atmosphere and great food!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's fresh, quick, and delicious Italian. I love the bowls. Make sure you try the pepperoni stick with the creamy Parmesan sauce. Also the lobster bisque and cannoli chips. We go here once a week, you will fall In love."}
{"text":"I love PIADA..... It's literally like chipotle but with Italian food! The food is so good especially the pepperoni sticks. WHAT!!!! soooo good! The only thing I will say about this particular Piada location is that you have to be patient; you'll be standing in line for a while."}
{"text":"As far as fast casual restaurants go, Piada is my favorite. I love that you can get a large salad and throw as many toppings on there as you like.  They have fresh tomatoes, onions, olives, cheeses, etc. I go crazy and pretty much add everything.  The pasta is surprisingly good - better than Olive Garden for sure.  They also have cheesy bread and Italian sodas.  It's a good option when you don't want to spend a lot of money but want something relatively healthy.  I took my family there recently and they loved it, especially the tomato soup.  Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for something like Chipotle but you don't want a stomach ache afterward."}
{"text":"I was really excited when I found out they were opening a Piada near me. I have been wanting to try the one in Oakland for a while now and haven't made it out that way.  Getting invited to the \"soft opening\" was really cool and allowed my friend and I to try multiple menu items. Keep in mind parking isn't the greatest at the block. 

When you walk in you walk up to the counter like you would at chipotle or hello bistro. You can really customize your plate by adding any of the grill items (chicken, steak, salmon, etc) to your Piada, Salad or Pasta. I ordered the fall avocado piada which is assembled in a homemade wrap. The wrap is stuffed with pancetta, avocado, arugula, spicy balsamic aioli, mozzarella, pepitas & roasted sweet potato for 8.49. The wrap looked pretty big in the picture and when I looked around at the other restaurant patrons Piadas they were a decent size. However, mine wasn't filled as generously. The wrap was pretty tasty, but be warned it is pretty spicy and salty due to the pancetta (Italian bacon). A few of the things they were passing around as samples was the soups and cannoli chips. I selected the lobster bisque and I would absolutely get that on a cold winter day. It was pretty thick and creamy and filled with so much flavor. I also really enjoyed the cannoli chips. They reminded me so much of my moms! Overall, I think the prices are just right and I'm happy to have this place in my neck of the woods."}
{"text":"This place is great! Who would think to put noodles in a wrap? These guys! 

The staff is friendly and helpful. If it's your first time or you just can't make up your mind they will give you some suggestions to have you leaving satisfied. 

And don't forget an order of cannoli shells to go!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to check this place out for so long! I received a BOGO coupon and went today for lunch with a friend. 

I ordered the chef's favorite piada (vegetarian) and my friend ordered the diavolo pasta. We both ordered a Parmesan stick. 

I like how you go down the line and can add whatever ingredients you want, similar to chipotle. The process was quick and easy. 

My piada was awesome! It's like a wrap but the wrap itself is crunchy and buttery. So good! And the diavolo sauce they put on it is awesome - spicy but creamy. And the Parmesan stick was to die for!! And huge. We were very pleased with the quality and quantity of our food. 

The only reason I knocked off one star is the price. We got two drinks, two Parmesan sticks, one piada, and an order of pasta. But we had a bogo so we didn't have to pay for the piada. And it was still $20! No complaints on the food but I was shocked when I saw the price. I actually made them double check it. Without the coupon, you could get a nice sit down meal for that price. 

I plan on returning to try some of their other menu options - and I'd probably return much more frequently if the prices were a bit lower. But overall great experience!"}
{"text":"A tastier version of Chipotle
At lunchtime, this rather trendy looking restaurant had a line of college students and staff from nearby Magee Hospital that extended out the door. We decided to return for an early dinner and liked the food a lot. A \"piada\" is a very thin wrap, and the assembly-line approach is similar to Chipotle in which you choose what goes into the wrap, but I thought the final result was tastier than Chipotle. I had a chicken piada and my wife had a salmon pasta bowl with angel hair pasta. Both were very good and we will return. Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Every year, Piada increases the price of their student deal by $1. Now, I have to pay $7.10 for a bowl even when I come during the student happy hour. In addition, they have much smaller bowls now (at least 40% smaller), which means we get less food than before. It's definitely not worth the trip and the cost anymore.
When I went in today for the student deal, in the middle of choosing my toppings, the worker said, \"you get 4 toppings; you can only choose 2 more toppings.\" That completely threw me off because none of my friends or I have heard of that rule before (and I chose some of the not so great toppings to begin with, so I felt like I got screwed over). I used to love Piada because of all the toppings, but that's all gone now.
Finally, we found what appears to be a twig(!!!) in one of our bowls. Having that in our food is absolutely unsanitary and disgusting.
I used to love Piada and come all the way out here to get it, but now I will never come back, and I will make sure my friends know to not go anymore either."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere, and overall an awesome concept. The food is decently priced and comparable to chipotle pricing. Lots of selections to be had. Also carb heavy like whoa, so be prepared to have a stuffed stomach if you finish your whole meal."}
{"text":"Food was good as always. 

Woman helping us out barked at us and put on items we didn't ask for.. didn't really listen to us. Couldn't seem to find a comment card in the restaurant which is preferred. 

It was a pretty uncomfortable experience and don't plan on bringing my business back. :("}
{"text":"Imagine Chipotle for Italian food. Yes not burritos, but pasta as a substitute for rice bowl. If you are considering it. I'm glad that I visited the business I'd definitely go back again. It seems like it's one of those places where it might take you a few times to accommodate yourself to the menu. Enjoy."}
{"text":"The food itself is GREAT from Piada...it's the service that doesn't compliment the taste.
As I walk in, I initally am the only person in line, and a group of 7+ employees are up front not saying a thing to me as if they were tired of working for the day. Then 2 female employees begin to fix THEIR OWN bowls before I'm spoken to for the first time. Eventually someone put on gloves and decided to start my order off. After that, while watching employees continue with their own food, someone else is standing around and enough time goes by in his opinion to put some gloves on and finish my order. It was if the employess were waiting for one another to complete my order because they didn't feel like it. My bowl is made, however it's still missing the meat component-crispy chicken frittes. Unfortunately he did not take it upon himself to make sure all of the contents from the small bag used to transfer the chicken in the bowl, was empty...and ends up throwing the remaining contents in the trash. It's already a small portion of chicken to begin with, so to throw anything out is not best. At this point, there is a line of 8+ behind me and there seemed to be no rush to serve them.
I then had to wait while the employees who fixed their own food rung themselves out (if that is what employees do). Overall it was not a good experience today. 
Again, I LOVE the food...not the service. Perhaps this was a bad day to go; I will remember that the next time and maybe call ahead."}
{"text":"Thanks piada for charging me $18.05 for ONE Diavolo bowl. To be honest, I'm not a fan of the new menu options. I get a Chicken Diavolo Pasta that includes the crispy chicken fritte for $6.85....I ask for some spinach and mozzarella, no tomatoes...but I'm charged $8.05?!  Had I just been able to make my own bowl I could pay under $8. I just wanted to get out of there, it made no sense why I paid more but I was hungry and I am usually satisfied with the food.
Today I look on my bank account and I see a charge from you for $18.05?! What's that about? I only got one bowl. Maybe next time around will be better......hopefully I'm not charged as much."}
{"text":"Definitely hits the spot when you need a quick Italian food fix. The salads are delicious and I tried a bit of my friend's meatball and it was great.  Oh and the piada pepperoni sticks with the sauce are a nice cheat treat."}
{"text":"It's Italian Chipotle! I was first introduced to this business when I was visiting my friend in Columbus. So glad they have locations in Cleveland now. Their pasta bowls are packed with enough food to share or to reheat for 2 more meals! Their lobster bisque soup is pretty tasty, so is the side of calamari with dipping sauce, oh and can't forget about their cheese sticks! (They used to have cheese, pepperoni, and artichoke, but looks like they did away with the artichoke.)"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. The food is amazing! I've never had anything I don't like. Everything is fresh and made right in front of you. My favorite is a make-your-own Piada. Gotta get it with a medium amount of pasta. It is must have! I will be back SOON!"}
{"text":"This new restaurant is such a great addition to the north hills!!! The food was awesome very reasonable and the staff was very helpful as it was our first time there!!!  We had the carbonara pasta, chicken sandwich, and a meatball!!!   It was a lot of food!!  Also the Italian soda is great!!!  Can't wait to go back to try something new!!!"}
{"text":"Completely blown away. Shocked there isn't a constant line around the block. Delicious. Steak piada & carbona w sausage were great. Balsamic salad was awesome too. Finished the fall steak avocado piada before a photo could be taken."}
{"text":"Super fast, cheap, and delicious! You can get a large pasta for only a $1 more than the medium. Get fried calamari as a topping"}
{"text":"Ordered: Chef's Favorite Piada, Tuscan Piada, Pepperoni stick
Price: $20.92

Ambiance: Very nice clean restaurant. I love the spacious modern/minimalist design which gives the place an upscale atmosphere even though it's a fast-food casual eatery. Staff were very efficient, friendly, and professional.

Food: Well-executed \"Chipotle\" of italian food complete with burrito equivalent. Paida focuses on well-executed sauces combined with your preference for starch, veges, and protein. We got the piadas for which the place is named for and they're essentially glorified wraps with lettuce, veges, and we got chicken. The Chef's Favorite was by far the better of the two wraps with a rich slightly-spicy slighty-tangy sauce that quite delicious. The tuscan was more mild-mannered but had a light and clean flavor that let the chicken do more of the heavy-lifting. For $8.50 the wraps were satisfying but not filling. The pepperoni stick was nothing special in the sense that it's a bunch of pepperonis in a wrap and grilled. It was a little greasy but the pepperoni did have a good flavor with a smidge of spice.

Overall we really enjoyed our meal and would gladly come back for a quick bite. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Oh boy is this a yum place
Street food is a misleading name ...this is a lovely place to sit and relax
you order you watch them cook and assemble 
they have Italian sodas on tap raspberry and teas
so you choose what is actually a thin crepe looking bread they cook right in front of you on a big grill
I avocado with cheese and veggies piada
it was so good
my son had a fried chicken sandwich he said it was really good 
they have lots of Piada choices plus salads and pastas
I saw a guy eating a big bowl of green noodles I wanted to ask for a taste 
all made in front of you 
everyone is very friendly and everyone is dressed to impress in white chef coats
its a great relaxed atmosphere I love their vespa symbol
I will be back"}
{"text":"This place is good for a quick bite, but I have a hard time shelling out $10 for a bowl of pretty okay italian food. It is awkwardly in between cheap, at-home italian and nice restaurant italian. Would not go out my way to go here."}
{"text":"Terrific food and the sauces are so delicious (all of them) a tiny bit pricey (slightly higher than chipotle) but worth it!"}
{"text":"Piada is all pasta, no sauce. If you're looking for quantity, this is where it's at, but be prepared for lacklustre taste due to their sparing use of additional seasoning/sauce. I normally don't mind taking home leftovers, but felt like passing this time because of the dry taste of unopposed carbs. 

I do like the option of getting Italian food chipotle-style and did enjoy their summer avocado/chicken piada at an event where they catered in."}
{"text":"The first time I heard of Piada was when I saw the article announcing that there would be a Piada opening on Center Ridge Road in Rocky River and the first 100 people in line get free food for a year. Although I'd never heard of it, and certainly never tried the food, I was intrigued. 
I gathered some friends together, camped out in a tent in the parking lot for 17 hours and succeeded in my goal. I was #30 in line.
I was sort of nervous to try the food when the restaurant opened the next morning at 10:45 a.m.-- I'd just waited 17 hours for this stuff...what if it was awful?
I have to say, I was and still am very impressed. The staff is very friendly and helpful and get customers through the line very quickly -- even on opening day.
Since we've been back, we've used our free meal coupons but we've also been buying additional items as well. I've had the chicken carbonara, the meatball pasta, and a salad.
I have to say that the chicken isn't the best...can't put my finger on it but I didn't enjoy it as much as I've enjoyed the other items there so far. I've only tried the grilled chicken, so I'll have to try the fried next time and see how that goes.

The Piada sticks are AMAZING. It's hard to describe them...they're sort of like mozzerella sticks, but then again, not at all. They are FLAT and breaded and inside have three different options: cheese, cheese and pepperoni, or cheese and artichokes. I've had them all and I would hiiiiiighly reccommend the cheese one and also the one with pepperoni.
My boyfriend is the seafood fan-- he's had the salmon, the calamari and the lobster bisque and loved all of it. And he wouldn't lie to me. :)

Also, cannoli chips. Basically tiny, empty cannoli shells and then they give you the filling-- that frosting stuff with chocolate chips in it. OMG. YES.

I also enjoy that is a \"fast-food\" restaurant but a staff member usually comes around to check in on how everything is tasting. Very, very nice touch Piada.

I'm happy and proud to say that I was the 30th person to try the food at the Rocky River Piada and I can't wait to try everything on the menu with all of my free coupons. :)  I will continue to spend money there as well on the other \"extra\" things I've mentioned."}
{"text":"I enjoy Piada. I really do! Every time that I have purchased food from this location the staff has been friendly and helpful. In addition, they work well together and my food is always fresh and fast.

I enjoy the pasta bowl with calamari every time that I come. I have also ordered the pepperoni wrap street food thing. I forget what it is called.

If you are looking for fresh Italian food and you are hungry NOW, Piada should be your next stop."}
{"text":"I have been to Piada a couple of times over the last couple of years and I generally have had good experiences; the food is pretty good, prices were OK and service was good; however I stopped by recently and while the food was good, the rest of the visit was very disappointing.  My visit was on on Saturday night at about 8pm; I was doing takeout since I had a two for one coupon.  

The line was pretty short so I thought I could get in and out fast unfortunately that was not to be.  Walking in I noticed that there is no menu board on the wall, instead they have some printed placards you can pick up in the line.  The menu is extremely confusing, there are a number of recommended bowls and salads, the prices are printed in a way that is very hard to read.  The menu does not even list the option that most people seem to pick the build your own bowl, piada or salad.  Even more frustrating is trying to figure out the pricing on these options, especially with the different sizes and protein options.  The person helping me was not much help on the pricing; she didn't know the actual pricing, but could tell me that the larger option was about $1 more.  I ended up building a pasta bowl and a salad both topped with the calamari.  The build process is similar to Chipoltle you tell them what you want and they add the items.  The biggest problem was that once we had finished the build process I ended up waiting about 10 minutes for the calamari to get added to my items.  The only reason I got the calamari was that I watched carefully to make sure that they added it and then I had to ask after about 5 minutes at which point they actually started cooking the squid.  I also had to make sure my order did not get mixed up with another order that was being made.  It was clear to me that the employees were going through the steps without much care or concern that the order was right or finished.  

Based on my past visits, the food line seemed messier and the restaurant is starting to get a bit worn down.  There seems to be a lack of energy and attention to detail.

The food itself was pretty good, the price $9.95 was higher then I expected; pretty good with the two for one, but not an amount I would want to pay for a single item.

I remember being excited the first couple of times I went to Piada, if this experience is where they are at now I know of a number of places where I can get better food, service and value and Piada would not be an option I would consider."}
{"text":"How most people feel about Chipotle.....I feel about Piada.  I'd rather have this any day of the week over Chipotle.  The food here is always fresh....tastes great...and filling.  Not spending a ton of money either.  Id had almost every pasta on the menu and each has its own unique taste.  Never had a salad but ive had that street bread or whatever they call it.  Sorry i don't remember the name but it is amazing.  This coming from a person that isnt a huge fan of eating bread.  This place is kinda upscale Italian fast food but I def dig it.  My parents live right around the corner and I will swing by and grab food to go....stay under $35 and have full meals for everyone.  Place is also always clean as well.  Staff has always been friendly and helpful w suggestions.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Love the The Calamari is really good .. go for a salad its pretty hardy with samon :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!   To me, where as Chipotle is one dimensional in cuisine, Piada is Italian based, but can customized in many ways to suit your preference.  Their customer service is top notch - hands down the best in the \"casual fast food\" category. They go above and beyond any restaurant establishment to make sure each guest is super satisfied.  Chef Marc is a great GM who really cares.  And the food is awesome - the many ingredient choices are all fresh.  You can eat here twice a week and customize a different meal each time.  With any establishment at first opening, there are kinks to work out, so if you had a less than stellar experience the first time around, get back there quickly and try them again.

I love their core values and philosophy and know it will continue to serve them well.  They have so many locations in Ohio you absolutely must check them out!  I am a huge foodie but an even bigger proponent of customer service.  Run, don't walk to Piada, they rock!  And, if you recall the long lines and don't feel like waiting, they have online ordering and a drive thru.  Nice."}
{"text":"Got a takeout order for 5 people. Order was ready when I arrived. It was conepletely correct and everybody loved their food. The Summer Power Bowl was awesome. I also added steak to it. For sure a returning customer."}
{"text":"First time there! Really enjoyed our meal. Parmesan Bread was delicious, warm and gooey! We tried the spicy Diavolo (might be spelled wrong ) pasta. It was spicy but really flavorful. Angel hair pasta was cooked perfectly. My husband got the Chicken pasta carbonara, it was excellent! Alfredo sauce, spinach, tomatoes, cheese and bacon. Limited menu but once you get up to order the choices are greater than we expected. Reminded us of Chipotle, that was the only drawback, very very causal and loud. We will go back next time will sit on the patio.
I would recommend Piada"}
{"text":"I wasn't thinking when I decided to stop in around 12:30 on a weekday. Holy line! It moved fairly quickly and was definitely worth the wait. 

I ordered pasta diavolo with chicken and a blood orange pomegranate tea. Everything was delicious and I thought the portions were perfect. I'm excited to make this one of my lunch spots."}
{"text":"Loved this! Only negative is that the food is a little salty. Good lobster bisque and vegetarian options. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I've tried this place a few times with my sister and now introduced Piada to my husband.

He gave this one a good thumbs up.

PROS: Bright atmosphere. Chipotle italian style. Fresh ingredients. Chicken and calamari are also fresh and delicious. I'm a big soup person so the soup was good but my husband loved it. Workers are nice and clean. Overall a really nice place. But this is comfort food in my opinion so I can't really handle it all the time. Oh and the pasta is good too.

CONS:  I didn't give this 5 stars because it's not some where I can eat frequently. 

Enjoy the yum!"}
{"text":"The \"Italian Chipotle\" meme has been beaten to death worse than a dead horse, and for good reason.  Keep everything else the same about the restaurant, but insert mexican food instead of the current italian fare and you would have sworn that Chipotle decided to change its name.

The food was just OK.  Definitely better than a mall food court choice, but there was nothing exciting about the options (especially the Italian burrito - see above).  Italian food needs to be full of flavor and accentuate the care needed to make every ingredient, especially when it comes together into a dish.

Staff at Piada quickly slap together the pre-made ingredients without care so they can move onto the next order - and the taste of it clearly also shows in prioritizing efficiency above all else."}
{"text":"So this is the newest restaurant in the new Cedar Center development.  My wife went here first and was impressed so I visited this weekend.  The location is new and clean.  The lines are long.  The concept is creating your own piada (basically a wrap), pasta or salad.  You have your choice of protein (chicken, beef, salmon), vegetables and hot and cold sauces or salad dressings.  They also have sides - fried calmari, soup, and piada sticks.  They have cannoli chips for dessert.  They do sell beer and wine, sodas, and your choice of European sodas and iced teas.  I find it very European that their alcohol drinks cost less than your non-alcoholic drinks.  Cute.  You place your order and they assemble your meal and you pay.  My wife ordered chicken and they scooped it out of a hot tray.  I ordered salmon and they cooked it fresh and flavorful.  The service seemed a bit disorganized, maybe because this is a new place.  The pasta was basic angel hair and well made.  The salads were basic lettuce.  Portions were HUGE and fresh.  I can't see coming here for lunch and not bringing food home.  Having smaller portions available would be nice.  We did not (and not many people when we were there) try the Piada.  The toppings and sauces were fresh, but a bit skimpy.  I could have used more cheese and sauce.  Also, if you want pepper on your salad, better bring your own because they don't have any.  The wine was flavorful for the price.  The european fountain drinks were a nice touch.  The dining room is modest size, but we had no problem finding a place to sit.  You bus your own trays when done, but one of the people cleaning tables offered to take ours.  Nice touch.  Overall, good, but not great experience.  Unique, fresh food, decent service.  A few adjustments and this place could be great."}
{"text":"Quick and tasty!

Do your self a favor and order the pepperoni stick. The creamy sauce they give you with it is amazing! You won't regret it.

I ordered the spicy pasta as a recommendation from one of the girls behind the counter. I added sausage and topped it with roasted red peppers and arugula. My only complaint is that the sausage is in oddly shaped patties which makes them difficult to eat.

Regardless, if you're in Oakland, give it a try. My finance ordered a piada and it was also very delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice addition to all the other restaurants in the Oakland area. As an Italian-style Chipotle, I guess the food and service are meant to be inexpensive and fast, with many students and workers grabbing and going during the day. Lines can still get pretty long during peak hour though, so we'll probably try to utilize the online ordering system next time we head over there. But it looks like they have their system down pretty well.

In addition to salads, they mainly offer piada wraps and pastas. Having tried one of each, the pastas are okay but nothing to write home about. Just because of the way that they are made, they still have a \"fast-food\" feel and aren't too filling or savory. The piadas are a bit heavier, maybe because of the wrap itself. They come together pretty well, and it could be the amount of sauce they use to intensify the flavors. I also appreciate how you can pretty much add as many vegetables as you want, while the meats (particularly the steak and meatballs) are done just right."}
{"text":"What's Piada? It's like...an Italian Chipotle Fast Food Chain. It's all about expectations, right? You never expect fast food restaurants to serve some delicious gourmet food. So, Piada is like that. You want good portions of food for a cheap price? Then Piada is your spot.

I came here when I was starving and boy, was I right to come here! The best part about Piada is you pick your own everything. Literally, think Chipotle but with Italian pasta and sauce. 

PROs: you pick your own toppings, price is cheap, quantity is huge

CONs: there's only 1 type of pasta (wheat pasta i think?) and it's not made very well, quality is mediocre."}
{"text":"Piada definitely runs the borderline of family-style/trendy-hipster. Students, medical professionals, construction workers, and families all go here for lunch or an evening meal. Honestly, I find their food to be over salted and overpriced. They're essentially an Italian chipotle, but at almost double the price. The ambiance is nice, and it's always clean."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Amore! wholly 5  pound pasta bowls batman!

 Ordered the pasta bowl.   It was enough for 2 people. The way this place works is you chose your protein, choose the format such as pasta bowl, salad, and or a flat bread.

The the portion of the protein was decent Although I would not get the steak again as it was pretty chewy,  The sausage was quite tasty.  There were 20ish toppings to add to the pasta bowl.   Lots of veggies, cheese, sauces and beans to chose from.  The pasta was cooked a perfect al dente,  By the time I finished creating the bowl it weighed at least 25 pounds. No Shit! 

The only room for improvement is that did not have anything to make the dish spicy. So for all you fellow spice freaks, you may want to bring your own scovil raising capsicum products."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  I came here while in the University Heights area to do some errands, as I heard good things from a classmate of mine.  It fulfills my needs of being a convenient, fast-food-ish, affordable place that serves Italian food, which happens to be a frequent craving of mine.  The serving format is similar to a Chipotle, where there is an assembly line of people putting together a piada/bowl with your choice of pasta vs. no pasta, meat, sauce, and veggies.  The piada itself is similar to a burrito, where I tortilla-like bread is wrapped around your meat/other ingredients.  With some help from the staff, I opted not for the piada itself, but instead for a bowl with the tortilla inside, along with pasta, some cooked zucchini/peppers, fried calamari, tomato sauce, and some tomato and artichoke scattered on top.  The final product was a giant pasta bowl, which was delicious, and enough for two meals.  With both the bowl and my drink, the total was still under $10.  Again, awesome.  The staff themselves were very friendly and ready to help, which is always a blessing at a new restaurant.  Perhaps the service could have been quicker, but I am willing to overlook that since they were so helpful and friendly.  I am happy to say this is a nice addition to the area around Whole Foods, and I'd be happy to come back for more."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want a humungous bowl of pasta after a long day of work. Sometimes you just want a mountain of pasta after sitting in bed all day. Piada is my go-to place for comfort food that is cheap and fast. Most of the staff are friendly and super nice about giving me extra pancetta or three scoops of beans. I only get the pasta bowls so I can't comment on the piada, but they look good. My new plan is to get them to make a frequent flier card (10 bowls, 1 bowl free? who's with me?!)."}
{"text":"The concept was cool.  The place was trendy and very clean. My wife loved the floors LOL 

The food was good and the way to order put me in the mind of a PeiWei, Panda Express or Subway. Just go down the line and point at what you want in your pasta.  Once I sat down to eat, the food was a little bit above warm. The flavor was good, but be careful to make sure you get enough sauce.   Portions were not an issue.  

The staff was very helpful and pleasant. Really nice of them to help direct the flow for folks that had never been there before.  We'd go back to visit now that we know what we're doing lol 

The Hibiscus Lemonade was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"First encounter with this place so I really had no clue what their claim to fame was.  I just happened to notice a \"Now Hiring \" banner out front which made me realize  there is a new place in town.

It follows a similar Chipotle ordering process, though at a much slower pace.  In fact, I was  glad it wasn't busy at the time, because it was  so stumbling to complete the order and payment process.  Not to mention the music is blaring , which makes you feel as though you are shouting to the person behind the counter.

Foodwise, everything listed looks delicious and fresh.  You pay a little more to get a better quality product, and a decent portion.  The signage displayed is a helpful ordering guide.  Certainly easy to read and follow.

Basically, your core menu is either a piada ( flat , breadlike wrap) pasta, or salad.  They have several standard creations using either of these 3 options and offer a nice assortment of add-ins if you wish to spice things up a bit. 

I ordered the Chicken BLT bundle and it was smothered with the best combination of sauces and dressing.  I think I used 20 napkins by the time I finished.  

Definitely recommend trying it out.  Some things to keep in mind.  Pretty pricey if feeding a family.  However, portions are large and can be shared,  or a children's menu is available for 12 and under.  Caloric info is listed next to each menu item, so it was helpful to refer to when ordering.  Catering is offered as well.

{"text":"Piada, a yummy fast food Italian place with friendly workers and choices that will tantalize your taste buds. My first experience here was a bit overwhelming so bring a friend. You pick the type of dish and then toppings.  I can say I was impressed with the lobster bisque(a little bit salty) and the calamari on top of noodles.   The calamari was absolutely spot on the workers were friendly and helpful. I sure asked a fair amount of questions so I was really happy they didn't mind. Being lactose intolerant can be such a hassle!!! They have a pretty interesting drink selection as well, peach tea yumm. For fast food Italian I think this is as good as it gets. The only thing i don't love is that they don't cook the vegetables with the noodles so the noodles were a bit bland but other than that, a great experience.  CleAn tables and great service when ordering food!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the Piada on Cedar in Cleveland Hts, but I stopped at this particular location by chance. The service was terrible. One of the service workers behind the counter hit on me very openly and then kept trying to talk to me when I was just trying to eat my dinner. All of his coworkers thought it was funny and he totally ruined my experience. Completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Just ok food. Great idea not executed very well.     Place is generic. Cold.  But clean.  Idea is great"}
{"text":"To say that I'm a fan would be an understatement! I discovered this place a month or so ago and have been back WEEKLY. (I now have my boyfriend hooked as well) The concept is quick, delicious, made to order food and it doesn't disappoint. The piada is made in front of you and delicious!!!! There are many different meat options to add to any piada along with fresh ingredients. I'm hooked on the Fall Avocado which is a speciality item listed on their menu. The pasta options are my boyfriend's favorite and also made to order, generous helpings, and delicious! At the end... make sure to grab a cup of the lobster bisque. You won't be sorry you did!!!!!

Do yourself a favor and go try it if you haven't already. Two thumbs up   from me."}
{"text":"I used to love Piada, but this particular location is abysmal. On two separate occasions now I've not been greeted when I entered. Now, even if you are busy, anyone with half an ounce of experience with food service etiquette should know to at least greet the customer, and if necessary, let them know you will be right with them. My food the last two visits has also been cold. The lines get long.  BOTH of my last two visits there was some issue with the cash registers as well. I will NOT be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I've yet to have a bad experience at Piada. I'm a sucker for the chefs favorite piada, but their salads and pastas are good too. Everything is super fresh and they have a pretty good variety, especially if you branch into the \"create your own\" category."}
{"text":"Absolutely a 5 star fast food experience. I had been hearing good things about Piada for years, but the idea of \"an Italian Chipotle\" as it's often described just didn't appeal to me for some reason. I decided to finally give it a try today as I was craving italian food but was short on time.

The \"piada\" is a wrap style sandwich, but you can also choose either salad or pasta bases. They have pre-crafted options but I did a make your own to see what goodies they had available. The choices were beyond my expectations, including sun-dried tomatoes, marinated artichokes, and crispy pancetta rounds. One of the \"protein\" options was calamari - when is the last time you've seen calamari on a fast food menu? Had to try it!

The result was a spinach salad worthy of a fancy restaurant - fresh, high quality ingredients tossed in the perfect amount of a superb, tangy, creamy parmesan dressing. The calamari mixed in was perfectly cooked with a light, flavorful, crispy breading that was addicting.

I was highly impressed by Piada and think we will soon be seeing Piadas pop up across the U.S.! Would love to try a pasta or piada next time, now that I know this place is the real deal."}
{"text":"Love this place. My wallet doesn't, because I'm always here. I'm so glad they are in Parma. If you haven't tried it you should. Anything you get is amazing."}
{"text":"Went to Piada for the first time and I ordered the Chicken Carbonara Pasta bowl. It was good, but I wouldn't say it was the best food for the price. The chicken was a little off for me, some about the texture. The sauce was very good and the greens were fresh. The staff was very nice and helpful with suggestions. I would go back, but it's not going to be my new go to by any means."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this place. I'd give it a 2.5. 
Italian street food doesn't make sense to me. Maybe i need to give it a second try? It was absolutely packed at lunch time.

I feel a lot of the food here lacks flavor. I went with a few friends and i sampled a salad, chicken fritte and the calamari & i was not impressed.

i really wanted to like it but its a no go."}
{"text":"I found myself famished after the day I've had, so I just wanted to eat. 
I've never eaten here so I thought I'd give it a shot. 
I wasn't really that impressed. Just seemed like standard mediocre Italian food. 
The service was fast and the staff was friendly. The restaurant was clean. I just found the menu boring."}
{"text":"Pasta, tomato basil soup and cannoli chips. How could you not love it???

Piada is an Italian Chipotle. You make your way in and try to decide if you want a bowl of pasta made to your desire or a wrap full of goodness. 

I went for the Piada (the wrap). I filled it with crispy chicken (amazing) zucchini strips, tons of different cheese, Alfredo sauce, sun dried tomatoes and some other things I don't even remember. It was great. So tasty!

I also tried the lobster bisque. Not my favorite. It just tasted to sweet. It was my first time having it... So I can't compare it to anything. I may just not like it... I don't know!  I had the tomato basil soup another day. That was amazing. So good."}
{"text":"Italian fast food... I never heard about it so when my friend invited me to Italian lunch I was expecting something different: candles, orchestra, wine, fireplace.Of course place is not as good as Dolce Vita in Little Italy, but not as bad as Sbara in rest area  on the way from Pensilvania.  Calamari Piada was very good, I  loved  watching it made in front of me.  Pasta bowl... Cold and flavorless.  I like my pasta hot-melting-delicious just like some sweet sin - pasta cannot be cold.  Person has to devour it without even being able to open  online calorie counter.  It has to own your soul.  In this day and age no one eats carbs that are not worth a poem. This pasta  was blah.  I don't know what it needed - little more butter, heat, soul but whatever it was, it was missing.  Finally  \"custom brewed iced tea\"  turned out to be peach snapple, and no coffee?!  Hello if you want me to come back, you gotta brew a pot. And have some tiramisu or some other Italian seductress of dessert.  Or people will go back to good ol' Panera bread next door. They have Danishes, coffee and nicer atmosphere.  It 's only a parking lot away."}
{"text":"Just had the steak Piada and a pepperoni piada stick, with their Italian soda.  I enjoyed the steak Piada much more then the items I had the first time around.  The Pepperoni piada stick I'll probably pass on next time as there really isn't much to it.  The Italian soda was interesting and different but I found myself going back to pepsi products at the fountain refill station.  This place is a solid 3 Stars, If they had a better combo system and had it for under $10 for the Item's I had I would give it closer to a 4 star."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this a try but it was mostly just bland and unappetizing. Food wasn't fresh and it was just uninspired boring fast food. I had the pepperoni roll which was fine but I'd rather just have pizza, and the carbonara which was just reheated pasta and a can of alfredo. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Piada.....kind of like an italian chipotle.....
you know.....pick your pasta, sandwich, salad and then add on those toppings.....
it's a good option if you are needing some quick italian. the lobster bisque is pretty yummy in my opinion. not a lot of lobster of course, but hey what do you expect from a fast food venue?!
i think the options of choices are pretty good~lots to choose from.
however, i was not blown away. 
cheap. quick. fresh. italian. that sums it up."}
{"text":"Calamari is awesome!! Everything is! The price point is kind of annoying, because everything is ala carte, they do not offer combos or meals. I guess it's like chipotle in that sense, but I find myself spending over $10 anytime I go for lunch. Whatevs. It's quick, healthy, and delicious, so it's not going to be cheap"}
{"text":"Me and boyfriend walk into Piada tonight. it was our first time there. Not really knowing how to order. We look out of place. With customers walking in behind us, we let them cut in front of us.  Customers were really nice helping us on how to order and what to order.  So we move to the back of the line with our order in mind.  The customer we were behind was a former employee and apparently dating the chef. She was very helpful.   She must of told the chef it was our first time. He was very informative on what sauces and toppings to add to our pasta.   As long as we been going out to eat I've never had anything like that happen. We were very grateful and appreciate.  So about the food. It was very filling and so delicious. I order the the meatball and crispy chicken. There a as so much, I have lunch for tomorrow and possibly dinner. lol My bf had the calamari which he smash when he got home. I don't know if he taste it, but he said it was very good. In all I would definitely recommend Piada to anyone who likes Italian food.  The staff was very helpful also.Thank you to the chef again."}
{"text":"We love Piada.. We eat here way to often.. the reason I didn't give a 5 isn't for the food it's for the people who work there.. I have never gone to Piada without getting a ton of attitude or the staff taking bad about another person or about how they don't want to be working.. we brought friends a few weekends ago and they had never been there.. before our friend could finish his order the women wrapped his wrap up. When he said he  wasn't done she responded in that same crappy attitude \"sorry\" and moved on... 

Hire happier people!!"}
{"text":"So I pulled up to the new drive up window unbeknownst to me my order was totally wrong. The young lady at the window offered me a free drink, awesome since I wanted to try the new blackberry hibiscus lemonade...its great by the way! Not two minutes later the manager Jonathan comes to the window just to apologize and see if I would like anything else. I say I'm fine, I was given a drink. Jonathan leaves and comes right back with three free meal cards and one more apology. How sweet! Best service ever hands down. An establishment that really cares about its customers! Piada-my new favorite place"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. There are very few \"Italian themed street food\" fast food places. A more well known fast food Italian chain as Zafoli's, which is entirely different and not nearly as tasty. 

My favorite combination here has been one of the classic seasonal piada's with fried calamari.. the unique flavor explosion is hard to find anywhere else.

Message to the owners: Hurry up and make it to the west coast, and I will welcome you with open arms and spread the word to my yelp elites."}
{"text":"I'm so glad my girlfriend recommend we come here. If I had to describe this place, I would say an upscale chipotle that serves Italian street food. The proportions for the price per wrap were huge. It's full with one wrap. They stuff the wraps until no more food can fit. The quality was great. The meal was made right In front of us, and was made with fresh food. The speed to get out of the line was great as well. With all the workers behind the line they quickly get you to the checkout while offering smiling faces. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the food here. The staff was nice and got my order made quickly and the restaurant itself was clean and comfortable to be in, but the food was beyond bland. I ordered the Chef's Favorite Piada with crispy chicken and their \"spicy\" diavolo (which wasn't spicy at all) and creamy parmesan sauces both completely lacked any sort of flavor. The piada was tasteless and unpleasant to eat texture wise. It was just a huge letdown overall. I also tried their parmesan piada stick side which was greasy and gross and left a weird aftertaste in my mouth. I only took a few bites of my meal before I decided that I definitely didn't want to finish it. Maybe their pastas or salads are better, but I definitely wouldn't order a piada or the piada sticks there agian."}
{"text":"Nice that you can choose the construction of your own food to tailor it to your taste. Nice too that you can watch them prepare everything, Ample portions. Nice variety of drinks too. Clean and bright, open. Enjoyed everything we ordered. Definitely worth going back."}
{"text":"We live right down the street from the Piada-Rocky River location and have been several times for a quick bite. Just after 7, the line was practically out the door, which brings me to my main problem with this place. Maybe it's because people are still getting acclimated with all the offerings and ordering process, but the line moves so slowly when it's busy! It was close to 7:45 before we got out of there - we could've sat down at another restaurant and gotten food quicker. Service has always been friendly, but it almost seems like they have too many options -- people get overwhelmed! Until yesterday I had only ever ordered a piada, so I decided to branch out and get a pasta bowl. Wild, I know. The texture of the pasta was great, and there was certainly a lot of it. All that pasta requires some serious sauce though, and unfortunately I think I got a total of 2 teaspoons of pesto. The noodles were so dry I ended up coming home and throwing on some extra olive oil dressing. I just wish they were as liberal with the toppings as they are with the pasta!

*Review Update*
Full disclosure: since writing the above I was contacted by Piada, who apologized for my negative experience and sent a gift card to their restaurant. I have been back twice, and have had much better meals both times. Most recently I went for lunch, and it was busy but the line moved pretty quickly. I also discovered the Farmer's Market salad, which is packed with flavor. I loved it. Needless to say they've been bumped up another star - yes, it does sound like a little bit of a bribe since they sent a gift card, but an establishment that pays attention to feedback and makes amends for a less-than-stellar experience will always get points in my book."}
{"text":"This place is clean, friendly and fast!i had the Italian beef sandwich and it was really good full of flavor! I was teetering in five stars but the pepperoni roll was made and rewarmed which made it super crunchy. They have this big round grill i would have liked to see that sucker cooked fresh I'll bet it would have been awesome. Other than the roll great sandwich definitely be back with wife and family!!"}
{"text":"Love The Food  Especially Their Basil Pesto Sauce.! & The Service Was Great. The Employees Were Super Nice! Def Gonna Go Again!"}
{"text":"love the food here but the guy who served me gave us so little portions. we pay $17 for two small bowls with two spoon full of pasta. he looked like he was the manager there, with a beard. just wasn't welcoming and gave us barley anything on our bowl like we used to get. kinda dissapointed but at least the food was good."}
{"text":"Although the food is good here, I feel that the servers are very inconsistent. One of my friends had almost no sauce and just pasta. I also feel that they put very little chicken if you chose chicken as your protein. Try the meatball pasta if you want a high protein to pasta ratio."}
{"text":"I always get a pasta bowl with a parm stick! I was sad to see they no longer carry sweet potato but I got the corn salad instead and it was pretty tasty! I'm happy I'm able to choose what's on my bowl, I don't have to stick with whatever is on the menu. My partner and I both have different taste buds so it's nice that we can both leave happy and satisfied. Today was a bit under staffed for a Saturday. But over all very good!"}
{"text":"Love! Just love! I could eat the canoli chips all day! Their lemonade was so thirst quenching, and pasta was tasty!"}
{"text":"Omgosh!!!!!! The food here is great! The head chef Ray is soooo pleasant and fun to watch. He definitely makes eating there like eating at home. I give this place five stars for exceptional customer service."}
{"text":"I stopped by here recently with my wife for dinner.  We were in Oakland looking for somewhere to eat whenever Piadas came up on Yelp.  Since my wife is Italian and it said Italian Street Food I figured that I would ask her what it was.  She had no clue but we decided on heading over anyways.  Upon entering the restaurant we were at first a little confused as there was a giant menu in front of us with a limited number of entrees. However after watching a few people order we realized that it was sort of like Chipotle only with Piadas or Pasta.  The inside of Piadas is actually nice and feels really clean.  There is the aforementioned line where you order and then a large dining section with lots of wooden tables and a giant illuminated  \"Piada Italian Street Food\" sign in the back.

On this day I decided to go with the summer avocado Piada which consisted of the Hand-rolled Piada filled with roasted sweet corn & tomatoes, fresh avocado, arugula, mozzarella, pancetta, basil aioli.  If you didn't look it up already a Piada is an Italian Flatbread and here they then roll the ingredients in and it looks like a burrito, hence my earlier reference to Chipotle.  In any case I rather enjoyed my Piada as it tasted good and felt like I was eating healthy.  My favorite parts were probably the pancetta which was crisped nicely and gave some salt to the dish and also the basil aioli which made the Piada less dry and gave some good flavor to it.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I enjoyed my meal and now that I've got the hang of what this place is about I think that I could probably make my Piada a little tastier."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. I have been craving it every since I went there the last time. The portions are huge for the pasta bowls and the ingredients prepared are very fresh. Piada will give Chipotle some competition as they have adopted the same business model with a new type of food. I love Chipotle, but it's nice to have a different taste besides burritos. 

The menu of Piada is a little confusing with the types of options available and I wasn't sure what to order, but my friend was with me and I copied what he had. I'd recommend getting the calamari pasta bowl. The calamari was prepared fresh and was a lot better than restaurants that I have been too. The cooks/chefs were walking around asking everyone how they were enjoying everything. All in all I felt like it was a great place for about the same price as Chipotle. I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this choice of a restaurant for the Oakland scene. I keep pasta to a high standard so I didn't expect too much going in, and it wasn't some crazy pasta delicacy, but it was exactly what you'd want it to be. Fresh ingredients with plenty of quick options that are different than your chipotles and Qdobas. Good when you want to switch up the lunch idea but only pay around 8-9$. 

I took a little girl I mentor here and she's usually kinda picky but she liked her pasta a lot and I enjoyed mine as well. Only complaint I have is that I got spinach in my pasta and they didn't mix it up enough for it to wilt at all before serving it to me. I don't like fully raw Uncooked spinach in pasta it needs to cook down at least a little. 

But I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I stopped by here with my wife and her family on a Saturday afternoon after a trip to the carnegie museum. It's in a nice location, right on Forbes going into Oakland and wasn't too hard to find parking and walk over. 

Walking in, it took us a few minutes to figure out what we wanted. The Tusca sandwiches and piada roles sounded interesting, but we were hesitant to try something new. My wife and her mom stuck to salad and my father in law and I had the basil pesto pasta with chicken, sun dried tomatoes, and freshly grated parm cheese. We also spilt a pepperoni roll between the 4 of us as well. We all very much appreciated the fresh ingredients for a very reasonable price. The regular sized pasta was enough to split with someone. The only issue I had was that there could have been more sun dried tomatoes and chicken to balance out the portion sizes. Regardless, it was very good and the pepperoni role was delicious! 

I will keep this place in mind when I am in the area. I want to try their piada next time.The Tusca sandwiches will also be on my mind next time I go. Fresh ingredients at a fast food price is very hard to beat!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Really quality ingredients and reasonable pricing. 

I ordered thru Uber Eats, so I cannot rate the actual \" in restaurant\" experience, but I can tell you that the Farmer's Market Salad with Salmon and the Tomato Basil Soup were great choices that I would recommend from the menu."}
{"text":"The salad is amazing, a interesting combination of sweet caramel(I guess?) and salad vinegar and crispy apples! Definitely 5 star for this dish! On the other hand, I can only give the pasta 4 star. Noodles are a little soft. Steak is good though. Okay meal. But I would not come back for the pasta. Overall great potion! And the food servers are warm and enthusiastic!"}
{"text":"Cute for a first or second date during the busy school year, but the food portions are small. The calamari and steak Piada are delicious, and the food is always freshly made and assembled in front of you."}
{"text":"Interesting addition to the Oakland restaurant scene - and much needed I may add.  There is really nothing compared to Piada Italian in Oakland.  It's not fast food but it also isn't a table served restaurant so it really breaks the monotony of the typical 'college town' options.
You stand in line cafeteria style but everything is made to order.  The \"piadas\" are a thin type of flat bread and you have several options for ordering.
I had the Tuscan Piada which was full of flavor and had a nice creamy sauce.  I could barely finish it and was definitely full when I left.  Other options are salads and a nice array of pastas.  They seem to have nice season choices as well.  
I'm glad they came to Oakland and think that people who work and go to school here will appreciate having Piada as a dining option."}
{"text":"Ahhh, I wanted to love this place. I really did. I'm a huge fan of the \"create-your-own fast casual Italian\" concept. But sadly, it didn't live up to my expectations. 

We went for dinner on a Saturday night, and despite there being only a small line (maybe 8 or so people in front of us?), it moved really slowly. When we finally reached the counter, it was loud and chaotic. I had to repeat my order several different times to several different people, and they still got it wrong in the end (I ordered a small pasta, but somehow ended up with a large). 

As for the food itself, I tried the pasta with pesto, grilled chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and roasted broccoli (for an upcharge). Sounds pretty good, right? Sadly, it wasn't. First, the ratio of pasta to toppings was WAY off (especially the chicken....very few pieces). My meal was like 90% pasta...and since they messed up my order and gave me the large size, I was up to my eyeballs in pasta. Seriously, unless you have a huge appetite or want leftovers, the large is way too much food for any single human. Combine that with the fact that there were very few toppings, and it was just a huge disappointment. The pesto sauce had good flavor, but it was very oily. Everything was also lukewarm. On the positive side, my husband got the pasta diavolo with calamari and loved it, soooo...maybe I just ordered the wrong thing? Who knows?

The space itself is nice (light, bright, and open), but it was a mess. The tables weren't wiped down and there was no ice in the machine for drinks (we alerted the staff, but the issue was not corrected the entire time we were there).  I dunno....like I said, I wanted to love this place and had high hopes (especially considering how good the reviews were), but I just wasn't impressed. Maybe I went on an off night? Regardless, this isn't a place I'm going to be rushing back to anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is like Chipotle for Italian food, but with fresher ingredients. I love the simplicity of the menu and you get hot food. It is pretty inexpensive and the lines are not long. I am glad you can make all of the pastas veggie and can choose your vegetable toppings - makes it taste like a salad."}
{"text":"The food tastes amazing and very large portions with the option to customize you're order, BUT the customer service sucked. When I asked a question about one of the options, I got the deer in the headlights look and a snarky remark, the cashier was no better-otherwise I would have given them five stars."}
{"text":"I realize this place is new and a few folks might have had a poor experience, however I really enjoyed it. The pepperoni piada roll was out of this world, I could stuff myself with 10 of those any day. The calamari piada was also pretty good. Next time I want to try one of the pasta dishes. Oh and you better get those Italian sodas they have on tap, they truly finish the package."}
{"text":"Horrible. Threw my food away. I would not recomend. My pasta had fatty slimy lunch meat in it. Conolis were stale and the cream was hard with a few chocolate chips in it. Never again."}
{"text":"Not worth the money or the drive. I don't know how anyone can give the place a 3+ review. Will never return. Food is in the garbage."}
{"text":"Updating my review once again.  Piada was gracious enough to send me a generous gift card (thank you) and I went a few days ago to get my favorite pasta bowl.  The service was improved based on my complaint, so do know they take these reviews seriously. The food was still great, I was greeted, no unnecessary attitudes that I experienced many times in the past. Staff was attentive. I'm gonna go a few more times before I do another update, but I think the way they handled the situation was was deserving of it's own update! Thanks Piada!"}
{"text":"Italian Chipotle only the servings of the pasta bowl are much, much bigger! I ordered a vegetarian pasta bowl filled to the brim with fresh veggie toppings and an italian soda.  What had me sold was the fact that the italian soda fountain had free refills. If you can't choose between the berry and the orange, mix them! A little bit of a drive for me, but well worth it and I will absolutely be coming back."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place since I heard a few coworkers rave about it. Met my friend there and we had no idea how to order or what to order. We stood at the line for probably 5 mins before even being acknowledged. We clearly had never been there before by the questions we were asking, and when someone did finally ask us \"what are you having,\" it was cold and almost like he was mad we were there. I had no clue as to what to order so I ordered the carbonara pasta. The alfredo tasted no better or worse than jarred alfredo in the grocery store. As he mixed my pasta he was careless and all of the add ins went flying and landed in other slots of toppings. He remained unfriendly and unwelcoming. The pepperoni breadstick was tasty and warm because it just came out of the oven. I honesty would not return based on the poor customer service experience alone. One last thing that surprised me is I think he was the manager."}
{"text":"Quick and tasty! Great spot to grab and go or sit and hang out for a bit! For those who have never been it is like an Italian Chipotle. I got the small carbonara pasta...despite being the smaller portion it was plenty of food! I would definitely suggest this place for anyone looking for a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"This was the first time we were here.  We were attending a show at the Petersen Event Center and wanted to catch a bit before the show.  After checking out all the options along Forbes Avenue, we decided to give Piada a try and I'm glad we did!!  The store front looks clean and inviting.  It's good food served at a fast food pace.  You can order from the menu OR you can create your own (like Subway - but way better!!).  I had the Balsamic Salad - it was so good - wish I ordered the large instead.  It had the right balance of ingredients and just enough dressing.  We got the garlic roll - OMG - if you like garlic - you'll LOVE this one.  We were full, but not stuffed when done - although it was so good - I would have liked more.  It was nice to see all the employees who were handling food were wearing gloves, they were friendly and fast.  It is a bit loud but not so you couldn't hear the person sitting next to you.  Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Was there for their preopening \"let's make sure we get this right\" dinner. Found out about it on Facebook to attend their VIP event. They spaced the time attendance so the wait wasn't too long. It can be compared to Chipotle just for Italian food. There are plenty of additions to choose from once you pick your main meal. Servings are large. Everything was well prepared and tasted great. I don't think there will be enough seating at prime eating times so be prepared to possibly take it to go. The staff was friendly and quick to respond. Their cannoli is awesome!!  I had the Mediterranean Power bowl. It would be 2 meals for me. The veggies were nicely roasted with a good amount of each provided. I would definitely check it out after a day of shopping at The Block."}
{"text":"I love Piada so much. I've been to the location in Columbus, OH and was excited to see one in Pittsburgh as well. You can get salads, pasta, or piadas in a build your own style. The regular size is really big and is similar, or more, than the amount that you would get at a sit down restaurant but it tastes more fresh, you can customize it, and it costs half the price. The small is a perfect option if you're not as hungry or have a smaller appetite. I've gotten both the pasta and the salad and have been impressed both times. I get fried calamari on top which is not your usual topping and it's delicious and so fresh. I hope this place expands to more locations I can see it doing great!!"}
{"text":"We love piada!  Unfortunately this location can't get any orders correct.  Orders are often made incorrectly and they are not interested in rectifying the situation. We have had issues several times with ordering in person and online so we are done eating here. It's unfortunate because the food is tasty. 
Edited to add: they recently changed the menu around to increase prices by $1-2 for any items and adding any protein is $1-2. So getting the exact same items is now $2-4 more."}
{"text":"Every time I've gone to this Piada there's been mistakes and misunderstandings. I've waited for over 10 minutes for salmon for my bowl only for the salmon to be placed on someone else's order. They always offer a free drink but that does not make up for my lost time. I've continued to give them a chance because the food is actually rather good."}
{"text":"Another great addition to the growing area!  I first found Piada in Columbus where it started and took a liking to it right away. Very happy to now have one around Pittsburgh. Great options for a fast meal that is different than your typical fast food or sandwich shop. The traditional Italian Piadas are a favorite. Basically a wrap that you can get pre-made or customize with your choice of fillings including pastas and proteins. I like the Tuscan with a few additions. The Power Bowls are also very nice. I especially liked the roasted cauliflower and broccoli options.

One miss that I noticed is that the ordering process is a bit confusing to newcomers. While I sat and ate, I watched at least two parties walk past the large wall menu to the counter to ask how to order and then be redirected back to the menu in the wall and then still have questions. It is setup in a confusing manner to be honest. I also noticed that people didn't know they could customize their orders.  A little tweaking may improve this but overall, this is a very minor flaw that should not make you pass this place up. Go and ask questions then enjoy a well made dish!"}
{"text":"Hits the spot.

You can make your own noodle and salad bowls. It's like a Chipotle but Italian style. So many different options of sauces, veggies, cheeses, and meats. I've only been once, and the pasta I created was not as great as I expected it to be, but maybe it was my lack of proper flavor blending. 

I want to go back and order again. The restaurant was clean and the staff was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Fast fresh fabulous! Good portions, reasonably priced. Clean and nice atmosphere. Enjoyed sitting with my friend after quickly moving through the line. Efficient and healthy. Would definitely come back. Check it out"}
{"text":"Piada opened up last week and Cleveland is sleeping on this place. Piada started down in Columbus and this is their 9th store, and 1st in the Cleveland area. It's in the Chipotle \"build your own\" style, but what makes this place great is the quality and variety of ingreidents. Toppings include fresh cheeses, pancetta, tons of different vegetables -- a large bowl (larger enough for two meals) goes for $6-8. My favorite, fried calamari is like $6.95 .... GO!"}
{"text":"Piada is one of my favorite new fast foods to go in Oakland. I am often faced with the problem of wanting something light and fast, but not wanting to settle for the typical fast foods that serve really unhealthy and heavy foods like McDonald's, Five Guys, or Popeyes. Thanks to Piada, I now have a place where I can satisfy my hunger with lighter options. 

Piada has the modern vibe you find in places like Chipotle and &pizza with cleanly cut corners everywhere and simple decor everywhere. The food is created in front of your eyes, and you have tons of options to customize what you want. 

I really like their pasta because it is chewy and also really thin. You get a lot of flavor out of it if you want to with their sauces, but you can also go for a lighter combination by pairing your pasta with olive oil and then adding a few veggies. 

What really stands out to me at Piada is their quick service, and their ability to put together a meal so polished with little effort. The only complaint I have about Piada is that their eponymous  dish, the piada, fell short of my expectations. Essentially, it is just an Itailian burrito, except it doesn't taste as good as a Chipotle burrito. I get it, it's a different style but I felt that the piada wrapping was rough, and the things you put inside don't really mix and pair well.

So Piada is really nice for pasta, where you can customize meats, sauces, veggies to create what you are exactly feeling for lunch of dinner."}
{"text":"My love for Piada is growing...because their online ordering system is so dang easy! 

I was in the mood for a quick dinner the other night and didn't feel like standing in line to get grub, so I placed an online order for a half chopped salad and a half Piada pasta bowl. Easy peasy! The online system is very user friendly and you can easily customize your order and select a time when you want to pick it up. Plus you can pay for your grub online, which even further expedites the process.

If you do order online, note the comical graphic for how to pick up your food. Standing in line = bad. Cutting = good. It made me chuckle.

My order was perfectly prepared even though I'd selected a bunch of different toppings, add ins, etc. A+ Piada employees! Oh, and my food was really good, too.

Avoid the Noid...err...line...order Piada Online?"}
{"text":"Soooo salty. Don't order the calamari; you will ultimately regret it. We couldn't even finish it because of how salty it was.  I had the Chicken Fritte Piada (again, way too much salt) and the flavors were just too much. It didn't feel balanced. This is the second time I've tried Piada, so it may not be this location's fault."}
{"text":"Darn, I wish I had better things to say about this experience. I was really looking forward to some fresh salad with the tops of pasta and set my sights on Piada about an hour before I landed in Cleveland. Unfortunately, when I got there at 5:30 PM, the staff was very disorganized and the line was very slow despite there being very few people present. 

The counter also was much messier than any other Piada location I've ever seen before. I also found it a little disheartening that the staff kept referring to the pancetta as bacon (and correcting me for calling it pancetta even though its the same thing and how they title it as an Italian-infused business as well) and told me the olive oil was canola oil but that it was like the same thing... I think there is room for some additional education and training of the staff that will go a long way at this particular location. 

The meal itself was OK but I honestly think the customer service experience turned me off overall. I am generally a five star fan of Piada! If you're new to this establishment, you can build your own pasta and salad bowls how long the bar and filled it with toppings like sun-dried tomatoes, basil, pasta, artichokes, bruschetta tomatoes, and much more. It's all very delicious and if you play your cards right you end up with a healthy meal :-)"}
{"text":"This was my first visit. I heard awesome things about Piada and I was finally able to give them a try. I drove 25 minutes from Elyria just to try it out. 

I ordered a small pasta with alfredo sauce and crispy chicken. Even the small serving size was at least two portions of pasta, way too much for me to finish in one sitting. I wasn't a fan of the alfredo sauce. I found it lacking in flavor and texture. It was a little watered down. The crispy chicken, bacon, greens, and cheese were good additions to my bowl. My boyfriend got a sandwich with chicken and spicy sauce. It was very flavorful! It was his first time too, and he kept piling on more ingredients to his sandwich. At the end, it couldn't be properly folded so it was rolled like a burrito. He later commented that the tortilla was burnt, but I had to point out that it wasn't supposed to be a soft burrito like Chipotle, but a folded crispy sandwich. It was just too big to fold the right way. He was satisfied. 

The cannoli chips were amazing. I loved the powdered sugar pieces and the dip was addictive!!

I would love to go back and try something different. The pepperoni stick looked really good. Too bad the customer in front of me took the last one!"}
{"text":"I like this place. I built my own pasta bowl with spicy tomato sauce and vegetables. I think the Gallic dough is a must order."}
{"text":"What can I say, the food isn't bad, the service either. But the sauce was spicy and too spicy for just their house sauce. If they are going to have a spicy sauce then they need a red sauce that is not spicy. It was just too spicy for me and though you get a lot for what you pay that does not go far if it's too spicy."}
{"text":"Piada is a fast food-style restaurant with adequate seating and a clean interior layout. It reminds me of a more upscale Chipotle serving a different kind of food (for whatever that analogy is worth..). Overall, it has the looks of a trendy/hip place, but the food I ordered was overly salted and not memorable. I would recommend for those in a hurry (although their lunch lines can get long at times) and craving something salty.

Things I liked:
-staff was incredibly friendly, walked me through what is a piadina (piada)
-fast, easy, lots of options to add
-good portion size for the price

Things I didn't like:
- I ordered a tuscan piada, and the food was incredibly salty. In fact, all I remember was biting into salt."}
{"text":"I went to Piada for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and I wasn't sure what to expect. But I was pleasantly surprised! My best description of this place is that it's like chipotle meets Panera ... but Italian food. It's in the heart of Oakland so the staff members were all younger, as expected. But everyone was very nice. We ordered a piada, which is basically like an Italian burrito. We got to go down the line and choose what we wanted in it. And it was delicious. We also ordered a salad that seemed fresh and flavorful and fairly large. We even ordered the cannoli cream and shells for dessert. It was a very decent portion for the price! We did not leave hungry. 

I also enjoyed the vibe inside. White brick walls and wood tables. They did a great job choosing the style and everything just worked well for the type of restaurant. 

The most negative thing about the place is the location. Parking can be so difficult to find and it's not a quick in, quick out kind of place in the heart of Oakland. But other than that, if I'm looking to grab a decent quick meal I would definitely go back. Its not a gourmet, sit down restaurant, but for a restaurant of this nature I was very pleased!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice change of pace from other fast foods.  Its sort like a chipotle-style or subway-style food line to build your order..whether its a plate or wrap.  I got the wrap with steak, which was well cooked and tender.  I had it prepared the chef's way (by the menu) since it was my first time there and I didn't know the different options.  Added some tomatoes and cucumber in the wrap at the end, though there are many more veggie options to include.  It was tasty and the sauce was pretty good.  Overall though, for the price ($8 for a wrap) and how much food you get, I'd much rather prefer going elsewhere, like chipotle.  I had to eat my entire piada and half of my girlfriends just to be full."}
{"text":"Love this place my food is always good I have yet to encounter a problem with the workers or have to speak upon cleanliness when going in there.. everytime"}
{"text":"I have been there 2x and the balsamic salad with grilled salmon has been fabulous. Very friendly helpful quick staff. Love the fast healthy food options. Only bad experience was that on our 1st visit my sleeping newborn was in her carseat and while I was getting my 2 year old situated the food runner reached into my baby carrier and pinched my baby's face. #1 don't touch my child with your dirty hsnds,could get her sick. #2 in what world is it okay to purposely wake a person's sleeping child. #3 your lucky I was caught off guard I would have slapped you. It's flu season and,she was the cashier touching $ and handling pols credit cards,she decides to touch and pinch my sleeping newborns face...sick"}
{"text":"So good! I got the chicken diavolo pasta and it was fantastic. While I got the smaller portion and couldn't even finish it, my boyfriend went with a \"regular\" and had leftovers for days. My only complaint is that the workers at the Beachwood location didn't seem so enthused to be there -- not mean, but just like they didn't care. I'll definitely be back either way. 

NEW REVIEW: The prices have gone up and the garlic bread isn't included with meals anymore, I probably won't be frequenting as often as I have been lately now. Also, the customer service and sense of professionalism hasn't improved much."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here this evening after being invited to their soft opening. I've been wanting to try this place since the first location opened in Oakland but never had the chance. Once it opened a little closer to where I live I was super excited to finally try it.

I went with the diavolo pasta with crispy chicken after much debating. Everything on the menu looked delicious! The serving was definitely really big. So big that I have enough leftovers for probably lunch and dinner tomorrow. This was my first time trying diavolo sauce and when it said \"spicy\" I figured that was just a precaution for those who can't handle spice at all. It was surprisingly pretty spicy even for me and I eat plenty of spicy food. It wasn't over spicy that one couldn't eat it but definitely a nice kick to it. The chicken was also delicious and cooked perfectly.

In addition, I had the pleasure of sampling the tomato bisque soup and the cannoli chips. The tomato bisque was fairly thick but the flavor was amazing. It may have been my favorite thing that I tried. This was admittedly, my first time trying a cannoli so I don't have much to compare it to but I thought it was fairly good. 

All in all, I really enjoyed my first experience at Piada. The staff was very upbeat and extremely friendly. It seemed like they were really getting the hang of making the orders which is nice to see as this is a new place. I highly recommend you all stop in and give it a try soon!"}
{"text":"Must try the lobster bisque!! For street food in my opinion could be cheaper. But the quality for price is fair. My new favorite spot."}
{"text":"I like coming here but I do think the prices are a little high. The selections are nice and the portions are good too."}
{"text":"Today was their official opening day and this place was packed!  All the staff were very friendly and they seemed well prepared for the opening although the line was quite long.  Staff came out to greet you with menus and to help answer questions and there were a ton of staff behind the counter . The menu has a nice range of items from a variety of pasta, salads, and sandwiches and you could choose the type of protein to top your pasta. All the pastas and salads were mixed fresh there as you watched and were prepared very quickly once you placed your order.  I got the Italian sausage as my topping on the basil pesto pasta and you could see the sausage being grilled right there.  All the staff behind the counter were super friendly and did not seem overly stressed or overwhelmed by the huge crowds of people which continued well past peak lunch time.  The pastas come in a large and a smaller size which is really nice since the large size is quite generous.  All the ingredients appeared very fresh.  They also had some garlic cheese or pepperoni breads made out of their signature piata flat bread which looks like a crepe.  They also had cannoli chips as a dessert item, which were delicious.  In addition to regular soda they have a few Italian traditional sodas which was a nice together.  There is a nice clean dining area with large tables where people can eat in or take their items to go.  This is right across from my office and I'll definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"This was really great, and they were terribly kind as well.  It's like Chipotle for italian.

So they have a tortilla of some kind that is filled with noodles, a meat of your choosing (I went with sausage), a sauce (I went with alfredo, but think I'll go pesto next time), cheeses, veggies, etc.  

Italian sodas are available from the fountain, too, and a fried cheese stick appetizer - a large wrapped shell around cheese, flattened, that you could break up and dip.  Not your typical cheese stick!

We told them we were first timers and they gave us free dessert, which was a super tasty bag of mini cannoli shells and chocolate chip cannoli filling dipping sauce.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"There are currently 40 people in line in front of me and 4 behind.  They must be doing something right. I love the pasta bowls. Recommendation to do basil pesto w a small amount of alfredo. I skip the piada stick side, they've been overly seasoned and greasy on previous visits."}
{"text":"Final update! This location offered me a gift card a while back that I now finally used. Seeing as my issue last time was with the online ordering being subpar, I used the money to recreate that situation. As you can tell by the rating increase, it was a better experience. I was also smarter about it though, and more specific.

Two complaints (which I honestly don't know if they have control over). First, you can only do a pick-up option time 30 minutes in advance. That is not very fast for a supposed fast eatery... Also, The order specifications text box has a character limit practically the size of a tweet. It was hard to give instructions.

By the way guys! Getting a small bowl orde doesn't necessarily mean less money. I was able to order a pasta bowl regular for less than a pasta bowl small. Just be smart about it!"}
{"text":"I have since gone back to this Piada location. I did not get sick this time, and  I'm blaming my food poisoning on just bad luck and a hectic opening. Oh, and the line went by a little quicker than before (but still slow...). 

Anyways. If you want something quick, cheap, and a huge portion in this area, Piada or Jimmy Johns is the way to go."}
{"text":"First time ever trying a Piada of any kind, and I'm at about 3.5 Stars. However, there were enough positives to warrant a return trip, and I wouldn't be surprised if I end up bumping it to a 4 after a couple visits. 


It's essentially the same logistics as going through a Chipotle line, with 1 difference: Chipotle has their menu on the wall above, Piada doesn't. Piada had menu's closer to the front of the line in a bin. So I looked at the menu when we made it that far in line and I decided I wanted a piada and put the menu back. I really wish I would have kept the menu with me. By the time I got to the register, I figured I'd try a side, but there were no signs anywhere that showed me the sides they offered. Im not exactly capable of remembering every single item from the menu I glanced at for only 30 seconds. I was standing there trying to figure it out and while the worker wasn't rude or anything, they certainly didn't pick up on the fact that I was confused and didn't offer to help at all, just kept asking me if I wanted a drink. This is why I think the potential is there to go to 4 Stars. I'll have a better understanding next time. I just wished they would have been a little more helpful.

The food: Chef's Choice Piada- It was fantastic. I chose the steak over the chicken because the steak just looked better after glancing at both trays of meat. It wasn't like other steak you'll see that sits out and becomes leathery. It was cooked medium and was tender. The diavolo sauce and creamy parmesan sauce worked well together and were the all-stars in the piada. I'd absolutely order it again, with one caveat: I'd make it a custom order rather than a specific piada. They have tons of awesome looking toppings to choose from, and I was excited to put a bunch of them on. Annnd they never asked and just wrapped my piada up. I guess you have to build your own to add those, I'll do that next time now that I know. But overall, the piada was awesome. 

Mediterranean Power Bowl- My wife got this trying to go a healthier route and thought it was just okay. She thinks ordering pasta or a piada next time is probably the better and more authentic way to experience this place. 

They have fountain Italian sodas that looked good. Also, I just asked for a cup for water and they gave me a large cup which is always nice. I hate when you get a little Dixie cup in that situation. 

The decor was nice and the place was clean.

Steak piada, power bowl, and cannoli chips was $23"}
{"text":"While I love Piadas food , especially the Lobster bisque, and recommend their food every chance I get, I must say this visit was disappointing in the customer service area! I understand the need to be quick and efficient , but sliding bowls down, yelling directives to other staff and limited sincere engagement with customers was a first!!
Also the bathroom was a filthy mess!!
I know it can be better!! We need this establishment to remain!"}
{"text":"This may become one of my favorite chains. The selection is different and affordable - and the TASTE - amazing. From the sandwiches to the soup and the AMAZING cannoli chips - do NOT leave this place without checking them out - best desert for sure!

Place is clean and staff are friendly!"}
{"text":"This is a decent fast food when your in the Chiplote rut... We enjoy the food each time we come. The pepperoni sticks are delicious. I tend to stick with a pasta bowl and add some veggies to one of their standard meals. Was kind of bummed to learn they no longer include the garlic bread with the meal but i should be watching my carbs anyway so no real issue. My fiance does the piada route and creates her own with a bunch of veggies. Sometimes i wish it was cleaner inside but i expect a bit of a mess from these types of places."}
{"text":"Food is decent as long as you eat it soon as you buy it in the car. Ordered them through uber and by no means the uber drivers fault, the bowls were half filled, food was ice cold as if was sitting out for awhile before driver arrived. Soup cups half full and no sauce with my entree. Avoid this place if you're having it delivered!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding taste, style, service! It's about time someone gets how to do fast food that tastes incredible and looks cool. I cant understand why the low reviews. I ordered the Pasta Carbonara and couldn't believe how fresh and flavorful it was. It tasted like I was at a fine dining Italian restaurant. Definitely my new favorite!!!"}
{"text":"So the guy with the tats on his neck was awesome, really knew the food/product- overall just knew what he was doing.  The blonde girl on the other hand was clueless.  My friend asked for a little bit of a particular sauce/dressing.  She is putting it on when he says that is enough- she then proceeds to put double more than when he said enough.  Guy with neck tats just shook his head.  He was thinking the same thing I was.  While I was eating, I watched this same blonde chick get herself a fountain drink while wearing the gloves that she prepares food in.  Made me want to throw up.  Take off your gloves if you are going to be touching something other than food.  The calamari was very salty.  Would have been better without the breading."}
{"text":"Pretty impressed! I'll sound like a broken record but yes, it's like an Italian chipotle. 

My friend and I split the Fall Avocado Piada with chicken and the Basil Pesto Pasta with chicken. Both were really good! I wish they offered different types of pasta like spaghetti or bow tie but that's not a huge deal. It's not the best pasta I ever had but for the price and convenience? Top notch. 

The Piada was probably my favorite. The flavors of the fall ingredients paired together perfectly. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love piada and I think their food is delicious. Every piada I've ever been to, the staff is quick, friendly, and seem to care about their job. Both times I've been to this piada, they have been VERY slow and inattentive to the customers. Even with us being the only ones there it took about 20 minutes to get our food, and with a line of 5 people it took 30 minutes this past visit. I love piada, but this location needs a major employee improvement."}
{"text":"Yum I liked this place! It's basically a chipotle for Italian \"street food\". I'm not really sure what that means but they offer wrap/pita type sandwiches, salads and pasta. I made my own pasta and used the spicy sauce, so good. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this Italian street food restaurant from my daughter that I wanted to experience it myself.

I decided to try the Mediterranean Power Bowl. The mix of roasted broccoli,
cauliflower and sweet potatoes, chickpeas and pickled red onions on top of red quinoa with harissa & Greek yogurt drizzle was very hearty and satisfying at just 660 calories!  I'd love to know all of the ingredients in the harissa Greek yogurt drizzle, it was the perfect accompaniment to the bowl. 

I downloaded their app so I can accumulate reward points and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"A big bowl of pasta, how can you go wrong?  I ordered online to pick up at 5:15, but arrived a little early and my food was ready by 5:18.  My Piada stick was delicious, although they forgot the Parmesan dipping sauce.  No problem.  The bowl was good too ($1.35 for those 8 tiny pieces of chicken? Ok whatever) However, in those 4 minutes I was waiting for my food, I watched a gloved man who was tossing cooked pasta pick up the phone, talk on it, and then return to tossing the cooked pasta with his hands...wearing the same gloves the whole time.  I'd like to think they sanitize the phone daily and only gloved people can touch it, but I doubt that's the case.  Considering it's cold and flu season and all the food safety issues in the news, you'd think they would be more careful.  I put my bowl in the microwave before I ate it, it was cold by the time I got home anyway."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with Piada! They had recently opened when I went there so expected some growing pains, but there were zero issues. Everyone was pleasant and helpful. The food looked, smelled and tasted delicious. My husband was crazy about his Porchetta Sandwich and the Cannoli dipper desert was the perfect ending to our meal. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Pasta inside of a wrap? How could I not be a fan? If you haven't been to Piada yet, it's basically the Italian version of Chipotle, and it's super yummy! I'm a little bit of a one trick pony when it comes to my order, but I love to get the piada wrap with spaghetti, spinach, Alfredo, pesto, cheese, and whatever else looks good to me that day.  Warning if you get this combo you will have the worst garlic breath ever for the rest of the day, but it's a risk I'm always willing to take!  Piada also gets bonus points for a clean, crisp, spacious restaurant that is casual without feeling cheap.  Definitely a nice change of pace whether you're on the run or just want to come grab a bite to eat with friends."}
{"text":"I would totally give this place a better rating if the employees weren't so awful. Nothing makes a food experience worse than feeling like the people hate their jobs, and worse, hate you for making them work. I'd imagine other locations might be worth a 3 or 4 star. A little pricey for the amount of food you get... but sometimes a quick bowl of pasta or a nice alternative to a burrito at the worst Chipotle ever about 50 yards away."}
{"text":"Very different option of food! Reminded me of a chipotle but with Italian food. Fresh options, great taste, reasonably priced, and tons of seating. Wish there were more choices, but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I have ate lunch here a few times and I always order the chicken blt and the lobster bisque soup. I have never actually had lobster bisque soup before but I wanted to try something different and I am glad I did it because it was so good! I think their prices are extremely reasonable for how good the food is. I definitely will be back here to get lunch again."}
{"text":"Since the last time I visited this establishment they have gotten rid of the small balls of fresh mozzarella I am totally disappointed by this so I change this into a one star review"}
{"text":"One of my first discoveries upon moving to Cleveland was Piada, which quickly became a go-to. And I was so happy to learn that it's a chain, and yet so sad to learn that it is still very localized to Ohio and Michigan. Now that I've moved away from Cleveland earlier this fall, I am all the more sad.

My favorite combo is the pasta bowl with steak, pesto, and everything else including pancetta, beans, and all the veggies. The steak is wonderfully flavorful and tender. And being able to load up on all the veggies is one of the greatest things about it! My boyfriend and I split one bowl, load it up with everything, and it turns out to be a really great portion size and a great deal - and we go home both stuffed and very happy! And with garlic breath, which serves as a lovely reminder of the delicious pesto-y meal we just had (did I go too far with that?). We have also tried the calamari and piada sticks. All good, but I maintain that the pesto bowl with everything you can cram into it is the star.

I also want to note that we've been frequenting this location since its earliest days and have experienced all the changes and improvements along the way. This to me says that they really want to make their customers happy and provide the best product that they can.

And now it's time for me to vent. My perspective on Piada, Chipotle and any create-your-own places of the like is to get AS MUCH AS YOU CAN on your item or else what's the point?? You're paying the same price, so load it up with all the toppings and condiments that you can! If you're going to walk into Piada and get a plain old pasta bowl with red sauce and no vegetables, go home."}
{"text":"First time here and have found they have great food and great service. The 3 Kids pasta bowls were awesome and so large my children now have dinner (leftovers). The Tuscan Piada was also very good and left me feeling full.
The chefs behind the counter were overly nice and very helpful. Being first timers they were happy to walk us through our options and how to order. 
Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food is subpar. Crispy chicken in my pasta bowl was hours old and slightly burnt. Zucchini and mushrooms needed to be fresher."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, and good. What more could you want from a lunch spot? 

I ordered the Crispy Chicken BLT Tasca lunch bundle. The Tasca was a layered sandwich (made with a thin Italian flat bread) with buttermilk chicken, creamy Parmesan + a spicy balsamic aioli, sweet pickles, pancetta, arugula and tomato. It was really yummy! I liked the spice, the flatbread was perfect, and the pickles were delicious. The chicken was only okay as it was not very crispy but everything all together was great! The bundle came with a side of corn salad and blackberry hibiscus lemonade. The salad was sweet and the lemonade was tart, just how I like it. 

We arrived for lunch at 11:45 and we were able to grab a table and order right away. There was no line. Ordering was a little confusing/overwhelming, but the staff was incredibly kind and helpful. By noon, there was a line out the door and no empty tables. This place gets busy!"}
{"text":"Ugh, this disappointment. I didn't realize from previous Yelp reviews that this was a deli/cafeteria style joint. It plays as if it will be table service in a nice Italian place, but it's fast food.

First off, I stood waiting to be noticed by the 6 people behind the counter for a really long time. No one would make eye contact, all were busy filling salad dressing bottles or sorting bacon, but ignoring customers. It wasn't even busy on the floor. When they did finally ask if I was ready, the gentleman was extremely friendly and got my order started of pasta carbonara with additional broccoli and roasted cauliflower added.

Slopping pre-cooked, mushy spaghettini and some tomatoes that looked like pico de gallo into the bowl, they topped it with the requested broccoli and cauliflower, moving me to the cashier. Then to my utensils behind me, all very cafeteria style.

I sat at a large common table and took a bite. If you were making a hot pasta dish, you would warn the customer if the items on top were not only cold, but had ice crystals on them, right? That would have been considerate. Instead, I had a bowl of ice cold veggies sitting on a coagulated, tepid cream sauce over pasta cooked so long as to become an undifferentiated mass of lukewarm semolina sludge.

No. That meal was revolting and got thrown away.

I give it 2 stars because my colleague loves this place and eats there almost every day, so maybe I just got unlucky."}
{"text":"Great food, interesting menu and affordable. Also really nice interiors. Try the piada, which is like a wrap and unusual, also their salad was very good. Also liked that the Italian soda wasn't too sweet. Would recommend highly."}
{"text":"First time here and I was pretty pleased. It's a chipotle style/ customize your dish type of restaurant. I had a piada wrap with crispy chicken. It as a pleasant change of pace from the usual chipotle wraps I've been having. Garlic wrap with spicy Italian season d chicken. I'd definitely go here again. With a drink the total was about ten bucks so not bad at all."}
{"text":"It was a very good experience. We were driving past and saw it and thought to try it. It's like the chipotle set up as you order your food and move through, but two meals, order breadsticks and drinks, $32.  Maybe a tad much, but this was definitely a nicer experience than \"fast food\" places for lack of a better term. Food was very good. Staff were super super friendly as we asked lots of questions. I will say with kids it seemed really fun for them. Families having spaghetti, etc, there just seemed to like how it keeps things moving without the wait time of a restaurant with younger patrons. That was very cute. We were there end of November I believe. I meant to write the review then."}
{"text":"For $10, I received enough food to feed myself for at least 3.5 meals. If that's not a win, I don't know what is. Their Wednesday $5 student discount deal is fantastic. However it only applies to the build your own bowl and not the new menu items, even though they took pity on my hungry, haggard appearance and gave me the deal for the menu items as well. It's also limited to one bowl per customer, so don't try to load up... I'm looking at you fellow hungry students! 

I love the Chipotle style ordering as other reviewers have mentioned. However, I also love that you can order bowls and piadas that have been expertly crafted for you. I have often fallen through the cracks at \"build your own\" type restaurants, and appreciate some hand holding when it comes to concocting meals. 

Fresh ingredients, fast service, and excellent sauces--this place is fast food done right. Must tries include the meatballs, the spicy red sauce, and their chicken fritte piada (but beware, it's on the spicy side). 

Also, if you're looking for a deliciously scented place to study, I'll admit that I have spent a few good hours lounging here with my bowl. It's not your average chic coffee shop, but it has lights, nice seating, lots of windows, and a seemingly endless supply of noodles--what more could you need?"}
{"text":"So many students come here every day. So especially in the rush hours the lanes are pretty long. The food is good and the service is really (!) nice :)"}
{"text":"This is the worst piada i have been to. They were out of several ingredients and shorted me on the ones they did have. There avocado was way over ripe and there salsa was mush. The servers paid no attention to my order and had to correct them numbers of times. Will never be returning here and do not recommend"}
{"text":"Good fast-casual food--the line might seem long, but it goes by quickly. Worthwhile chain to have in Oakland. Solid for a nice, safe bite to eat when you can't make up your mind and don't feel like cooking. Their seasonal harvest grain is a low key winner (get it on the side with your main) and I'm glad to see consistently fresh ingredients being used to prepare the food. Seating can be a little difficult or awkward if you come in with more than a few people. I've only tried a few combinations on the menu so far, but I'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Fast casual Italian restaurant - I would definitely recommend to others based on price/value/convenience.  Neat design inside restaurant, pretty quick and convenient.  If you are there, definitely add the cannoli chips for dessert.  While they are messy (I found most Piada eating to be messy), it is SO TASTY!"}
{"text":"Came here for the pre opening vip event and got a free meal for me and my boyfriend! I got the pasta pomodoro with a meatball and he got the pasta carbonara and we both really like the food. It was a pretty big portion which is always a plus. The people that work there are super nice also! Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Have had lunch at Piada 2x with my wife.  Both times the meals were great...pasta, soup, sides, salad and wraps were excellent.  Service is friendly and obviously new.  It is a bit slow, but that will improve with time."}
{"text":"Interesting concept, but the pasta tasted only ok. My boyfriend got the salmon salad, and that was tasty"}
{"text":"It took forever to find the place. Typed wrong address in GPS. Took no time to order food. The first guy in the line was pleasant, the girl on step 2 -meat selection asked as if she was annoyed to be at work, the 3rd person -step 3 was also disengaged, the veggie guy was fine as was the final guy the cashier.  The best person and most friendly was a young lady who assisted my daughter and I before we left out. She was very helpful. She had just gotten off work and was still willing to help a customer. Very refreshing. Now as for the food, my daughter did not like hers,  the pasta was too thick, so she ate the meat. She used Alfredo sauce, so it could have been that. My salad was ok. They could have put more marinara sauce. I think they could have identified some of the various condiments, cheeses, etc. will I go back, No. 
Nothing to shout about."}
{"text":"Great and quick food.  The spicy tuscan salad was amazing and filling!  The berry soda is delicious.  It is a little pricey for the service and quantity of food."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch on line but when I arrived at the restaurant with an assigned pick-up time the food was not ready and I had a 10 minute
wait before it was. When I got home I realized that they charged me for salmon but did not include it on my salad.  After a quick message to them they did credit my card but it was a real nuisance.  So, the food is good and that's the only reason I gave them 3 stars.  They obviously need more help and maybe people who read the orders before they prepare them."}
{"text":"The food seemed decent at first, but both me and my friend became ill an hour after lunch.  I ordered the calimari and he the chicken."}
{"text":"Yum! Fast, reasonably priced, great flavors. All the ingredients taste fresh and they have so many great options. 

Also the look and decor of every Piada I've ever been to is very nice. Definitely setting the bar high for fast casual"}
{"text":"Since dining here, I learned that the pasta is made with egg, so no more Piada for me. It would be super awesome if they would serve a whole wheat pasta as an option. I loved the food, but oh well. Could still do a salad I suppose."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this Piada! Being from Columbus I've been to a handful of Piada locations and this was by far the friendliest staff I've encountered so far! The woman who appeared to be the manager was very patient and helpful with the first time guests in front of me. The rest of the staff was equally helpful and kind to me and the other guests. Great job ladies! I left with a full belly and a smile on my face! :)"}
{"text":"Oh Piada, you have stolen my heart! Went here for the first time yesterday - it was so needed in Oakland and SO delicious. First off, ORDER ONLINE if you can! The wait there is always extremely long no matter the time of day. I ordered online and was able to walk straight in, grab my food and go. It held up great on the drive back home. I got the Chef's Special piada with calamari and added onions & avocado. Absolute perfection! A great blend of spices, sauces, flavors, textures...i'm still dreaming about it now. Prices are beyond fair for the quantity and quality of food - I probably could and should have saved half for later. Parking is difficult if you do not live/work in Oakland. Will be back more than I should!"}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time, Calamari Piada was alright, a bit small for the price. My big issue with this place, they have shamelessly ripped off Chipotle, could they not be original, even a little? The menu: Piada, Bowls, Salads, Make your own. Look at the drink station, look at the whole place, carbon copy of Chipotle and that doesn't impress anyone."}
{"text":"I went back today happy because I had not been in a while and sadly, they have made some changes just to fatten their pockets. I ordered my regular pasta diavola and found out the hard way that the cheesy garlic bread is no longer included in the meal and it is an extra $1.50. Which made my lunch $11! Though the change is small it has quite an impact to the consumer and the fact that the staff didn't inform me of the change up front until I questioned it at time of payment, left me a little salty. I have to say that I will not be back if this is the route they are going."}
{"text":"How is this not a national franchise? I've been here three times (always get the BLT crispy chicken piada) and it's always delicious. They have healthy bowls and pasta too, but i haven't tried that yet. What's also nice is that they have not just soda options, but a few different tea varieties as well."}
{"text":"had the balsamic salad. quite possibly the best salad i've ever had. long wait, but completely worth it."}
{"text":"I attended the pre-opening of Piada Italian Street Food in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Piada Oakland is defined as, \"a fast casual, authentic eatery serving hand rolled Piadas, Pasta Bowls and Chopped Salads\". Their namesake signature meal, the Piada, is actually a wrap an, \"Italian thin crust dough, baked on our grill and hand-rolled with fresh,  ingredients\". They also offer feature or build your own pastas and salad.

My BF and I were each treated to a complimentary meal, drink, and samples of various Piada menu items. Out of all the delicious menu items I selected the Basil Pesto Pasta with steak including, \"fresh basil pesto, Parmesan Alfredo, sun-dried tomatoes, freshly grated Parmesan\". I was served a huge portion of pasta. It was very good, but a little off on the ratio of pasta to sauce for my tastes. I definitely wanted more sauce and cheese to top off my dish. I still enjoyed it though.

BF ordered the Chef's Favorite Piada of \"spicy diavolo sauce, romaine, sweet & spicy peppers, mozzarella, creamy Parmesan\". He enjoyed his Piada saying, \"It was nice and saucy, the crunchy chicken was delicious\".

We also sampled the pepperoni Piada sticks, lobster bisque and a quinoa & grain salad. We then hunted out the coveted dessert cannoli chips with chocolate chip cream, which were definitely messy but worth it!

Overall I was glad to have been invited to the pre-opening of Piada Oakland and enjoyed the meal. I think that this fast-casual option will do really well in the Oakland location with the hospital employees, visitors and the college crowd there. Great feature and build-your-own healthy & fulfilling menu options sure to please that area's crowd. Find it on Forbes Ave where the Quaker Steak used to be."}
{"text":"Had the Mediterranean Power Bowl with chicken. Really enjoyed the grilled vegetables. Sweet potatoes and chickpeas were a nice touch. Pickled red onions jazzed it up the perfect amount. Very friendly staff. Top end of the casual fast restaurants."}
{"text":"This was an interesting take on the piadina. I wouldn't call this very authentic - it certainly felt like an American twist on piadina. It was almost more tortilla/burrito like with non traditional filling, but still fresh and tasty! 

The cannoli chips were also kinda new and fun, but I don't know how many cannoli I actually ended up eating..."}
{"text":"While driving by Cedar,me and my wife happened to quickly glance this place several times and always wanted to try it. We had low expectations, I mean Italian street food in the middle of a Sprint and and a GNC? When we entered the restaurant, the first impression is \" This is a cleaner, nicer Pasta Chipotle\". We both got the carbonara pasta with chicken and Italian sausage. The portions were plenty and the food was really tasty. I am definitely coming back. 

P.S. my wife is super picky with Italian food and she loved it. 

P.S.2. Fancy BlackBerry Hibiscus lemonade  was great."}
{"text":"Was curious about this place.  Pasta was hot and tasty.  Menu was complicated and difficult to navigate.  It would take a few visits to get it right.  Being from out of town, I don't know that we will seek it out next time."}
{"text":"The pasta is ok, particularly with the crispy chicken. I have found the piadas to have too much sauce and at least one of the sauces is too spicy for me. The service has always been friendly when I have been here. It can be a little slow depending what you order but it's not outrageous."}
{"text":"Holy crap, I didn't even know something like this could be this good. The Chipotle of Italian food as my friend called it delivered. Got a crispy chicken piada with pasta, marinara, parmesan, spinach, mushrooms, and croutons. I had to say oh my god after the first bite; it was heavenly."}
{"text":"The food is excellent for fast food. It's made to order but still fast. The customer service is awesome. I like to order online and pick up - no wait. The wraps are very tasty and the tomato soup is amazing. Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is b/c of the price. It's way overpriced for the amount that you get. Drinks are especially high. I would go more often if it was a better deal."}
{"text":"First off, the food is great. We eat here a couple times a month and it's delicious every time. It's essentially a Chipotle for Italian food. The employees are always friendly and working hard. When it gets busy and the line slows down a bit, you can tell they are doing everything they can to get the food out asap. The managers always make sure that you are taken care of. Every time we eat there one of the managers stops by our table to make sure everything is satisfactory. You won't be disappointed with this place"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food every time. I come here for lunch 1-2 times per week and am always able to get in and out quickly. Great location."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great! The first time i came here it was a little on the rocks with some of the cleanliness, but after my second time it is 10 times better. Everyone is very friendly and kind while also getting my order through correct and fast. The only reason why it is not a 5 star review is because the table management could use some work. All in all this is a fantastic establishment to go if you want good, fast Italian food."}
{"text":"I ordered Diavolo pasta with grill chicken and sweet corn salad on side. The noodle is nice warm and have good taste. Grill chicken and tomato chunks taste fresh and nice. Diavolo sauce is really hot tho. One star down for the corn salad, it is too oily and salty for my taste. Didn't finish it."}
{"text":"I loved it. It is like an Italian chipolte. I just got take out for my husband and moved thru the line slowly because it was my first time and a bit overwhelming. Unlike chipolte, there are many options for vegetarians and I am excited to go back and have a salmon salad bowl. Kids will love adding all their own toppings and I had gun trying to guess what my spouse might like in his piada. Hint : the sweet-spicy peppers are really spicy, and I love spice. A great concept and I wish them well."}
{"text":"I would rather give 0 stars!
It's 12:08am and both my 4 year old daughter and I are still awake with food poisoning after eating at this establishment! We ate chicken fingers (and that's the only thing we ate after 2pm, so I know that's what caused this!)
My daughter is vomiting in excess and I can't get off the toilet!
We are healthy people, this isn't a coincidental 24 hour bug, this is a direct result from eating here!
I have never reviewed a restaurant or any other business for that matter, so don't think this is some ploy for free food! I wouldn't eat it for free or even if you paid me!
My first time, and definitely my last at this place!
You can delete this to protect your image, but I will post this everywhere I can as I sit here on the toilet all night you son of a bitches!
NO EXCUSE FOR THIS!
----------
**UPDATE**
My wife ended up getting a call from the store manager that offered to reimburse us for our purchase. We thought that was very thoughtful and took her up on the offer! They said they needed her to bring the debit card that we used to the restaurant so they could refund us.
When she arrives, one of the \"partners,\" was there and said that they don't do refunds, but would give her a gift card! She explained that a manager called us and offered the refund and politely turned down the free food. He told her if she wanted a refund she would have to contact The corporate office!!!
WHAT A JOKE!
You can keep the money Jonathan and we're never coming back! I hope that $31 was worth it!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place, but now the service is so incredibly slow, and it doesn't matter if you do an online order. Never once have I waited less than 15 mins past my scheduled pick up time. Want to order in store? Same problem. Just waited in line 20 mins, only to be told it will be another 15 mins if I'd like the Italian sausage I ordered. This location needs to pull it together."}
{"text":"For what piada is, it deserves 5 stars. If you're going in expecting completely authentic Italian food, you'll be disappointed, but if you look past that, you'll realize that it's great! 

We went in during an off hour so the line wasn't too long. We got a piada (fall steak and avacado piada) and a pasta (carbonara). With the pasta, you get to customize it, choosing the kind of meat and other toppings you want in your dish. It's kind of like a chipotle where you see the different toppings in front of you and choose. We also got the cannoli chips which were SO good. It's essentially the outside of the cannoli with the filling in a separate container. They were so addicting I couldn't stop eating them. 

The price was reasonable and you get a lot of food with what you order so it's definitely worth it.

The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was very clean and designed very nicely. 

I will definitely be coming again and throughly enjoyed my experience here! If you're going to go, I would recommend not going at the peak hours because the line will be a lot longer."}
{"text":"I came for the grand opening VIP event on Saturday. I have never been to a Piada and was kinda just going to see if this would be my new lunch spot or not! I have been getting the emails for a few weeks now and the food looks amazing. I liked how everything looked so fresh and so good! 

We got there right at 6 PM and it was super empty. There was one other table in the restaurant with a few girls but that was it. BUT boy did it really fill up fast! The place was bumping in about 15-30 minutes. We were greeted right away and the door person was really efficient. We got our tickets scanned and looked through the menu. I thought that possibly the door person could have explained the menu and what we were allowed to get or not allowed to get a bit more. I didn't really understand what a Piada was or if we were only getting one thing or half a thing and half another thing. I went back to her to ask. I got my clarification quickly and we ran back into the line!

We decided to get two different pasta dishes because those looked the best on the menu. 

I decided to order the 
BASIL PESTO PASTA:Parmesan alfredo, fresh basil pesto, sundried tomatoes, freshly grated parmesan. I added more sundried tomatoes, extra fresh tomatoes,grilled chicken, and extra pesto sauce. One thing I can say is that the portion sizes are ridiculously huge. The pasta was premade but was not stale at all. The ingredients tasted really fresh and I enjoyed the veggies. I will say that the pesto had a strong taste of oregano. I had my friend also try it and we both decided it was slightly overwhelming, not pesto like at all, just more oregano. The alfredo also was not as strong as I usually like an alfredo to be. It just was not parmesan based it felt. It was just a bit dull. The plate was good, but eh.. I don't know if I would get it again. 

My friend got the
PESTO POMODORO MEATBALL:100% grass-fed beef meatball, pomodoro sauce, fresh basil pesto drizzle, freshly grated parmesan. She loved the meatball, I thought it was just ok. But we both thought that the red sauce was a lot better than the alfredo. I would get this one again, but maybe with a different meat than the meatball.

I also tried some of their Italian sodas, never again. TOOOO SWEEEETTT for me. I had to dump it out and get some water.

We also got little samples of the cannoli chips; yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Give me some more of this for sure. The little bit that we got, yummy! And we got to sample the tomato and lobster soups. NOPE. They were too thick. They needed to really be less thick and watered down. The flavoring was too strong. 

I will go back again, I know I will. But this time I might want to try out their sandwiches or those good looking salads!"}
{"text":"So so yummy! I had some avocado corn wrap thing (i don't remember the exact name) and it was delicious. The people working were also really nice"}
{"text":"Stopped in after that long, over 2 hour late Doctor appointment.  Was starving.
Interesting new place with nice decor.  The line was not to long and was able to make a decision on my order fairly fast due to the menu on the wall.  The Piada is a custom rolled wrap that is heated on a stone grill.  The wrap was good and I think the cook put some EVO on it as it cooked.  You can also get a salad or some spaghetti noodles/bowl.  The food is prepared along an assembly line just like the auto industry, or Chipotle or Subway.  Anyway, I ordered the Chef's Favorite Piada with calamari.  The calamari was an extra $1.49 which is really reasonably price.  The calamari was a little tough and OK.  The wrap was stuffed with spicy diabolo sauce, romaine, sweet & spicy peppers, mozzarella, and creamy parmesan.  Will definitely try to return and try some other options if in the area.  
The staff was friendly and did a good job of answering questions."}
{"text":"Had the summer avocado piada with steak and a blackberry hibiscus lemonade (hh deal half off lemonade on weekday afternoons). The Piada itself was very delicious - perfect balance of crispy and chewy with just the right amount of olive oil (pretty sure?) for that fresh flavor.

However if I were to order again, I would avoid the steak which was dry and salty. I also wouldn't get the lemonade which was too sweet for my taste... But I admit I'm particular where I like to taste the tart and sour of my drink 

Anyways - all in all a good and quick place to grab a bite with moderate prices ($10 for my piada) or just drop by to rest and read a book with your meal (totally did that)."}
{"text":"After my last review discussing how stellar the service/food is, I have to follow up with it was terrible. I ordered takeout via their online website on Sunday to pick up on Monday. I get there and pull into the drive through pickup window and no one knows where my order is. I end up having my husband park with our infant daughter and go inside. Still no luck. I show my order confirmation and finally the cashier says oh yes I closed last night and remember getting that order. I hung it up so that they would have it today. She goes into the office for a few minutes and comes back with nothing. She tells me she has no idea where my order is. So I get in line to reorder trying to read my receipt to her to get both my and my husband's orders correct. When I go to check out I am assuming they will try me my order is complimentary since they lost it and wasted 15-20 minutes of my time, but nope they ring it up offering no discount. I present 2 coupons for free soups that each my husband and I have and the cashier informs me I'm not allowed to use more than one. I looked up and simply said seriously? You lost my order, I had to come in, reorder, pay full price, etc. and now you aren't even going to honor my coupons, so she did. I really love Piada so I hope they get this online ordering thing down pat and that they teach their employees better customer service."}
{"text":"An upscale, Italian version of Chipotle? Yes, please!

I wasn't sure what to expect from this place, but they officially won me over. It works just like a Chipotle, except there's an actual Chef behind the counter and the food is far more upscale. They cook their piadas on a real stone grill, which adds a nice char flavor--much like a pizza cooked in a wood-fired oven. The sauces are great, the toppings are suburb and the meat is scrumptious. Unlike many Chipotles I've been to, the staff was very accommodating and friendly. The whole restaurant has a very hip, laid back vibe too. 

I honestly can't think of a single bad thing to say about the experience. I'll definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Loved the food but the service was kinda slow. I love all of the different options for the pasta bowls as well as the salads. I definitely will be back to try different options. Whenever I need my pasta fix, this is my go to place!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times before and never had an issue until tonight. The staff was rude, the store was out of several ingredients key to several of their offerings. They moved super slow. It was overall disappointing."}
{"text":"Piada is always busy, and I've never been disappointed in the 5+ times that I have visited. There are a lot of fresh toppings to choose from and the portions are big."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally try Piada but was  underwhelmed at best. Although the staff was great -the food was lacking. Our pasta was lukewarm and the flavors just weren't there. The garlic dough had a clump of cheese inside that had been melted but it wasn't warmed up enough the second time around. Sorry to say but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped by Piada for dinner with the family. I ordered a balsamic salad with chicken and some beans. The salad comes loaded with fresh baby spinach and then they add the other toppings. The salad was fresh and delicious. The chicken had to be fetched from the back of the restaurant instead of just scooping some from the bin where the steak and chicken were. That was odd. The sodas were also tasty and refreshing. My wife liked her carbonera pasta, as did my daughter. My son couldn't finish his chicken tenders, so we polished them off for him. Oh my gosh, these were some tasty tenders. They were definitely the star of the show and I'll probably order some myself next time!

I'll be back to try a Piada and some chicken tenders."}
{"text":"There's a Piada opening in my neighborhood this week and I can't wait to eat there. I was looking for a place to eat after work last Saturday and I happened upon this Piada. I thought I'd get a sneak peek of what's to come in my neighborhood. 

I ordered a lunch combo with an Italian tasca and corn salad. I watched the tasca being made and it looked delicious and fresh. The cook started off by warming up something that resembles a tortilla on a small, round flat top grill.

A few minutes later, I was eating. The tasca was different than anything I've ever eaten before both in taste and texture. It was amazing and I loved it. The sauce on it was out of this world as were the combination of flavors. I can't wait to go back. 

The roasted corn salad was fresh and of good quality, but it generally lacked flavor. I would order it again because it's healthy. I also ordered blackberry lemonade. 

So looking forward to Parma's Piada! I can't wait to try a bowl."}
{"text":"One good thing is you can get a lot of pasta for just $8. Unfortunately, they don't do a thorough job cooking their pasta. 

Their technique involves the following:
- Scoop a bunch of pre-cooked spaghetti pasta
- Stir them around aimlessly in a heated pan (without placing the pan on a stove)
- Toss in raw vegetables or cold protein
- Apply a light scoop of pasta sauce
- Take your money

Other options on the menu include sopping, greasy calamari, and oily \"Piada sticks\". I cannot recommend this place, even for a fast-Italian fix. To me, pasta needs to be generously covered in sauce and served hot. My suspicion is that Piada is patronized by individuals who are tired of the other uninspiring lunch options in Oakland. Nevertheless, please do not settle and accept the food from here as adequate Italian street fare."}
{"text":"Nice place for good food when you're in a hurry. Italian food but in the same fashion as Chipotle. The pasta bowl with Spicy Sausage is a favorite of mind. The Italian Sodas are a perfect combination to the hearty bowl!!"}
{"text":"What a great spot for lunch! I had the market salad with a Parmesan stick and my friend had a turkey pesto wrap/sandwich with their corn salad. Everything really was so delicious! Nice portion sizes so you don't over eat, but leaving feeling satisfied. 
The staff was super friendly and helpful since we have never been there before. I cannot wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"We went to Piada on a Wednesday around 6:30 - and the line was nearly out the door. By the time we realized that we might not make it to our show on time, it was too late to bail. The line was slow but steady - and the staff were friendly and apologetic for the wait. 

I had a summer avocado piada with extra pancetta, the balsamic salad with no red onion, and a blackberry hibiscus lemonade. I repeated this order nearly three times as I moved down the line, yet my piada did not have extra pancetta; and, my salad had the red onions on it. Had we not been running late as is, I would have asked them to remake both.

I will say that I really loved how fresh the food is here - and a unique flavor profile for the right price. It was tasty enough for me to give their customer service another shot. I will definitely go back - and hope to be able to update my review to the 4-star that I wanted to give."}
{"text":"Came here for the grand opening VIP event. Was super excited to try this new addition on Forbes. They scanned our tickets and then we got in line. The restaurant was heavily staffed and everyone was very friendly. The interior was very rustic modern with lots of wood and white. 

I ordered the chef's favorite piada with fried calamari and my friend ordered the spicy diavolo pasta with salmon. Once I ordered the piada, the lady heated up the thin piece of dough on a huge griddle. Then, it was passed down a long assembly line. Another lady put the spicy diavolo sauce and parmesan sauce. Then someone else put the lettuce, peppers, and finally the calamari was put on. 

The piada itself was very different from anything I had before. The calamari was cooked well and not too chewy. The sauces added a nice tangy spicy taste. It was also surprisingly filling. My friend's spicy diavolo pasta with salmon was pretty big. The salmon was lacking flavor. 

We were also able to sample the sides once we sat down. The lobster bisque was very creamy and tasted great. The parmesan dipping sauce for the cheese stick made the cheesestick. Finally, we had the cannoli chips, which were a sweet delicious ending. Overall, it was a great event"}
{"text":"Quick update.  Best time to come to Piada is on Wednesdays. If you have your student ID, you can get any bowl for $5!!! That means you can get a large pasta bowl with any meat (pick one only) for $5! Portions are huge. I usually get my pasta bowl with the calamari (delicious) and diovano sauce. The only thing I wish they could do better is make it less confusing to order since theres so many bowls being thrown around and then they can't hear you amongst the loud background noise of the kitchen, the crowd, the music - yeah, ordering can be a hectic thing especially when I ask for a ton of stuff on top meaning I always have to say more more more, and more dressing on the side.... but anyways. Can't complain though since I am getting a whole ton of good food for only $5. What a steal!"}
{"text":"Price is really reasonable and for a chain restaurant I would say their food is really good. I usually get the pasta and they are good, but I can't say for other food though."}
{"text":"Such a unique lunch experience from the typical Oakland scene. Similar vibe to Oakland's lunch options but the food is very unique. Recommend!"}
{"text":"This place has successfully wow'd me!

At first glance, it looks like a much cleaner, nicer italian version of Chipotle. I especially love the calamari wrap. It's cook to order so you have to wait for a little bit. but it totally worth the wait cuz it's just SO GOOD!

I also saw their manager last time I was there. He was cleaning the tables, and helping an elderly person - he grabbed the chair for that person, helped him put the tray on the table and got water and utensils for the old gentleman. What a kind soul! 

Their food is a little bit MSG charged but I will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go to if you want a filling lunch that doesn't make you feel like crap afterwards. It reminds me of an Italian version of chipotle, but again...I don't feel bloated after eating.

The staff was EXTREMELY nice. I am a wimp and can't eat too much spice so they accommodated my needs, no problem, which I really appreciated.

Definitely check it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Piada is the shit! It's basically the Italian version of chipotle. Eat here for delicious food with extremely good value for your money"}
{"text":"YUM! This is actually my second time eating here, must have forgotten to review the first time. Shame! 

My first encounter was with online ordered takeout. I placed my order around 11am and selected 11:45 for pick up. I arrived at 11:40am and thought I may have to wait but my order was ready. The gal who received my online order said she made my food right when she got the ticket???? ugh. So my food sat there for a while. It was a salad and thankfully it was still okay when I brought it back to my office. 

I dined in for my second experience and it was much better. I heard from coworkers that this place gets a wicked line around 12pm so I told my friends we should meet at 11:45am and it's a good thing we did. The awkward line area was consistently full from 12-1pm. 

Ordering the food was a bit overwhelming. They shouted out many questions!!! Thankfully they did so with a smile on their faces. They also must have sensed the sheer panic on my face and guided me along.  I got the BLT Tasca sans the B. It was delicious!!!! The bundle comes with a side and a drink; the street corn and hibiscus lemonade were a great pairing for this delicious sammy. 

Very good, will go back.... but not too often, there are a few less expensive/similar quality places in the area."}
{"text":"I had a pasta here (pesto) and it was alright. They have a lot more pasta noodles than I expected, but sadly the pasta wasn't very warm. It would be nice to have really hot pasta. Salmon tasted great though!
The place itself looks great though, with good lighting and clean tables."}
{"text":"I heard wonderful things about Piada but honestly... not as good as I expected. For a newer location, I expected the staff to be polite but instead they were just sarcastic and rude. The food was nothing special, something I can make in my kitchen without any extra efforts. It's good for a quick meal while out and about."}
{"text":"This place is like the Italian chipotle!  I really enjoyed my visit.  The employees were very friendly and willing to explain or answer any questions I had.  Although I think this place is slightly more expensive, the food portions are over the top!  

In my opinion, it one of those places(like chipotle) where you have to go a couple times, and try different combinations to really find what is your perfect meal.

I also really enjoyed the atmosphere, it's very modern with garage doors opening to the small patio!  Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"This place is set up on a street corner and it looks small but it is a lot larger than you think. If you see a lot of people waiting in line, still go in because there still are probably seats because it goes back farther than you think. My family and I stopped in here for a quick bite to eat. We all left very happy with the food we had eaten. Since my mom doesn't have a yelp, I feel like we should want me to mention that the meatballs were really really good. They have a lot of choices for different types of pasta which was cool. I don't have anything like this near me, but I wish I did, which should say something about the place. The place was really clean and to get your food is a line, kind of like Chipotle, but you order immediately when you get there and walk along as your dish is passed down the line. It was really quick as well. I liked how the people there were dressed in the cool chef outfits and I noticed that they were having a lot of fun cooking and being around each other, while serving us, which was really cool because they were all happy! They had a lot of choices besides pasta, but I would definitely recommend getting pasta here. I had pasta with pesto and chicken and it was really good."}
{"text":"Piada!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I heart you. 

I was amazed by the presentation, atmosphere, service, and the quality of the food. 

My BF and I got the pesto pomodoro meatball pasta with an extra meatball to share. This is more than enough for two people, maybe even three. Pasta was cooked perfectly and the taste was wonderful. We also got the pepperoni sticks which were really good as well. They come with a Parmesan sauce, but I would have rather had the red sauce with them. 

I also had some of the berry Italian soda, and OMG. I'm not a pop/soda drinker, but that raspberry soda gets the gold star from me. 

I could have used more pomodoro sauce for the pasta in addition to a side of pomodoro for the sticks, but that's just my preference. I also think having some house wine would add to Piada's fabulousness... again just a preference.

I will definitely go back to Piada soon!!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten her twice since they opened a few weeks ago and have enjoyed my food both times.  I've had their chef's special piada and their farm club tasca with the seasonal harvest grain side.  I would eat that side in buckets it was so good. The flow of the restaurant works well and you can tell it was well thought out.  Try are able to move you through the long lines fairly quickly which is great for lunch in Oakland.  The serving sizes are perfect for me and I feel content upon finishing. Also, the prices are on par with everything else in Oakland.  I will continue to test out the menu and look forward to when the spring/summer food comes out."}
{"text":"I was dubious when my friends wanted to eat dinner at the \"Italian Chipotle\". I hate waiting in long lines, especially for food. When I saw that the main features were carb- and dairy-heavy (i.e., pasta and flatbread sandwiches), I was especially doubtful that my meal would be memorable. 

I was totally wrong! I had one of the best salads ever! There were so many amazing, quality ingredients, I can't even remember everything: greens, grilled mushrooms and zucchini, onions, sundried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, white beans, etc. there were also different cheeses and meats to choose from. 

My friend got a pasta dish with a gigantic meatball that I was sort of coveting, and her husband ordered a giant portion of pesto chicken pasta that looked amazing as well. The people next to us had a side order of fried calimari, which is definitely going to be what I order next time.

Employees were super friendly and cool, and the prices were reasonable. My giant salad and a beverage was about $10.

I will definitely be back, and often."}
{"text":"So glad I finally got to check this place out! My husband and I grabbed lunch here and the experience was fantastic. The food was excellent - - hubby ordered the crispy chicken BLT with kettle chips and a cup of lobster bisque, I got the pesto pasta. Hubby particularly loved the wrap and bisque combo, and the creamy, savory pesto was perfect over angel hair.  The portions are large enough to share, the drink choices are great (get on that hibiscus blackberry lemonade), and the warm, laid back vibe made it all the more enjoyable. We will definitely make it one of our regular lunch and dinner spots!"}
{"text":"I had heard things about it from other students in the area, but once I actually went, I was really impressed by the quality of the chicken BLT. The wait time and ambiance prevent it from getting full marks, but the quality of the food for an Oakland place puts it solidly at 4 stars, definitely worthy of your time."}
{"text":"I love this place especially when i am in a pasta mood or i just want something healthy. If you are new to this place i recommend trying it more than once until you figure out what kind of sauce and meat you like with your food. You can get a bowl or wrap and you can get it stir fried as well. I like mine stir fried when i want all the ingredients mixed together but if i want it more of a salad i just stick with the bowl. I always get double chicken which their chicken is extremely flavorful. I also add their grilled zucchini and mushrooms and their peppers. The next step is figuring out your sauce. My favorite is spicy diablo which by any means it is not spicy. I also recommend the pesto as well. Then i add lettuce which you can choose spinach as well if you like, but i don't think spinach goes well with the pasta. I also add onions cucumbers artichokes and whatever vegetables you like. It is really flavorful and delicious."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and stop here to create your own piada! It's like an Italian burrito and make sure to add pasta!! Then you can add pasta sauce and as many other toppings as you want including 3 different kinds of cheese, spinach, sun dried tomatoes, and green or red onions. I personally add calamari, but they have different proteins to choose from. They also have regular pasta which I hear is just as delicious. Make sure to add a Parmesan stick! I would eat here everyday if I could."}
{"text":"This place is very tasty! Let me first say that I am somewhat picky when it comes to food. Specifically I don't like processed meats that much other than pepperoni and can't stand American cheese etc. that being said this place had no bad elements for me.  Not to mention there was an enormous hunk of Parmesan on the counter while I was paying so that was very pleasing to me. I got the chicken blt despite my mostly vegetarian diet. I eat meat very seldom. The chicken was perfectly crispy and light with some fresh notes of what seemed to be a light lemon slaw and other crispy veggies, including arugula.  It was real chicken not processed crap and reminded me of a warm hug. That is how fried chicken SHOULD be done. I am beyond happy with my first experience and highly recommended this place. It is a must try spot and especially if you like real good food."}
{"text":"What happened to this location? I've been here a handful of times over the past 2 years or so and always been happy, but yesterday was a shockingly bad customer service experience. 

Three people working the front line constantly talking to each other and not interacting with the customers at all. The woman in front of me had to tell them a few times that they forgot an ingredient she had requested. Each time the employee would say \"huh? Oh.\" And move it down the line. I asked for a Piada stick, and also wanted to add something to my salad but the employee in the middle never looked towards the customer line and continued her personal conversations instead.  Any attempt to interrupt was met with a glare or eye roll. The man behind me also had similar issues. 

It was not always this way. Piada, I know you can be better! Keep a supervisor on the front line at all times - especially during a dinner rush."}
{"text":"I was looking for something that was open on a holiday since my family did our gathering early and this is what I found.. I should have known what to expect when I called and they were rude over the phone.. the saddest part is the best service I received was another customer holding the door for me when I arrived. The ordering process was simple very chipotle-es however since this was my first visit and I was clearly confused it would have been nice to get some explanation. Even a \" have you dined with us before\" would have helped. I ordered the Tuscan Piada which was a little too spicy for my liking.. when I got to the register I asked about their Italian teas and got the rudest reaction.. you would have thought I asked her to go make a fresh batch a tea for me when in reality I only asked what flavors they were.. maybe I went on an off day or maybe Italian street food is also served with a side of attitude!"}
{"text":"I used to be a Piada regular over a year ago and I loved the fast casual Italian concept. It was quick and easy to pick up after work for dinner and a nice alternative to Chipotle. 

However their menu and prices have since changed. While yes you still get a large serving of pasta for $7.95 the large varieties you could choose from have since dwindled to only 3. The tomato basil pasta w/ chicken and added artichokes was pretty good but not amazing. The Piada sticks now have tomato sauce inside of the them vs as a dipping sauce like they used to have. 

With these new changes - I probably won't go out of my way to stop here, unless I happened to be in the neighborhood and specifically wanted pasta and didn't want to cook at home."}
{"text":"I love Piada I used to go to the Beachwood location often. Great food. Was super excited when they opened at Shoppes of Parma. Line was short ran in to grab dinner for the fam. I understand it's a new location. But the glass in front of the food is duct taped. So it's already broken? They have no signs hanging with menu or most importantly, prices. Ordered 4 large pasta bowls. 1 meatball, 1 salmon, 2 crispy chicken. Little disappointed they had little vegetable. No olives or artichokes. Size was decent. Ordered 2 Parmesan cheese steaks and order of cannoli \"chips\". $47 and change. Salmon was $10.50 other 3 each $9.50. They used to be comparable to Chipotle prices. Which is only $7.50 for steak! The Parmesan sticks are good but not for $2.50 a piece. So while the food was good it's carb based. For almost $10 I'd like it to last longer. The cannoli \"chips\" were just empty shells I had to stuff myself. Pass. Not worth $3. While I enjoyed the food I probably won't be going back. Too expensive for fast food."}
{"text":"I've had this twice now, both delivered by Uber eats so I haven't been inside yet, but the food is insanely delicious.  If you're looking for something different but cheap and fast, this is the way to go.  The portion sizes are perfect for lunch.  I feel satiated but not disgusted with myself after eating it, and that is rare."}
{"text":"This is a neat place for lunch, it did seem that the staff is still in training because the worker who assisted me had to ask for instructions on making the carbonara which is a menu item. They were also out of ice while I was there. The food was ok, the service needs some improvement."}
{"text":"I came here twice now. The first time I ordered create your own pasta with spicy dressing, calamari and all kind of veggies for about $8. It was so tasty. The second time I also ordered a create your own pasta with fried chicken and alfredo sauce. Both times I also got the Parmesan piada sticks. They're thebomb.com!
The wait is pretty long lunch time and dinner time so my suggestion is to order online in advance and pick it up thirty mins after when it's ready. It is so easy and they also send you offers for free piada sticks when you place your first order online. 
This place is definitely the place to go when I'm craving for pasta and don't wanna spend $20+ for it."}
{"text":"I have been complaining that Oakland doesn't have fast-food Italian to which people say ... what is \"fast-food Italian?\" PIADA IS FAST FOOD ITALIAN.

I came with a friend for the pre-grand opening as a VIP, I came eagerly and was delighted. The staff was super attentive and knowledgeable. I appreciate that they let me add croutons to my meatball pomodoro pasta dish, as well as veggies to my liking (I recommend the sweet and spicy peppers as well). I've since been back on a \"regular\" day and the staff and food was just as lovely.

My roommate has had the chicken piada (I haven't had anything besides the meatball pasta.. omg so good), but she's a fan. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"This ish is delish! I am blown away by how flavorful my Mediterranean Power Bowl was. I imagined this bowl full of health would be okay, and was a little bitter of not getting a bonafide Italian dish. After one bite I knew I was not missing out!

It truly is a bowl full of goodness with cauliflower, broccoli, pickled veggies and a whole bunch of other good stuff with quinoa and a tasty AF dressing.  Even during lunch rush, it was fast and efficient.

My gluten free note is that each member who handled my meal kindly switched their gloves to clean ones for me when asked, which I appreciated. 

I'd eat this every day if I lived/worked in Oakland! I'll have to just live with this being my \"visiting Oakland\" treat!"}
{"text":"You would think it was opening day and no one had been trained. The 'chef' or guy in charge was loudly reprimanding every employee while they all were screwing something different up. And it wasn't busy. I witnessed them make an order wrong twice, spill things, and forget items in an order.  A disorganized mess, and the food is no saving grace either.  The descriptions sound great but end up being just ok. Lobster bisque tasted frozen and lacked any discernible trace of lobster. Sandwiches honestly were reminiscent of subway with worse bread and less filling.  Thumbs down the entire way around."}
{"text":"Interesting new quick service Italian restaurant. Got the feeling that if it was not a stand alone restaurant, I was eating at a higher quality food court. The piadas are essentially Italian burritos. I had the apple and cranberry harvest salad and angel hair pasta with meatball. The meatball was great! Moist and tender. I tried a piece of a friend's piada which was quite tasty, the various sauces really make it. Otherwise, nothing extremely noteworthy. Great to try."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review of Piada. It's getting 5 stars because it's always consistent, friendly staff, reasonable prices, fresh ingredients and quick service. 

It's a chain fast casual restaurant. Knowing this I can say it's always fresh quality food. The staff ads always friendly. You can pick between salad, pasta or a wrap. You pick your protein, sauce and toppings. Tons of varieties. Artichoke, sun fried tomatoes, calamari, steak, feta cheese. 

Whenever I need a quick dinner I stop into Piada."}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular. Friendliest staff I've ever encountered in a restaurant who were genuinely excited.   Definitely a breath of fresh air for the food selections in the Oakland area.  I genuinely shed a tear as I was eating the pasta.  My favorites were the sausage and the cannoli chips.  The Italian soda fountain compliments the food wonderfully.  13/10."}
{"text":"I'm not that impressed... and I don't really get the hype.  There was an insanely long line for this place on a weekday evening for dinner.  We just wanted something delicious but fast... didn't quite have the time or the energy for a sit-down restaurant meal that day.

Well, the line moved ridiculously slow.  The staff were very courteous in helping put our meal together.  I got the stake salad, and the bf got the chicken pasta.  My steak salad was totally skimped on greens.  It's a salad, you can't skimp on greens.  The chicken pasta tasted ok, there wasn't anything particularly wrong with it.  But it wasn't anything I'd rave about or seek out again either.

I guess part of the fascination with this place is just because you can customize your order (\"chipotle - style\"), but really not worth the time or the price.  It was over-priced for what we got. I'd rather go to some restaurant in Little Italy and get a proper meal, or throw together college-style pasta at home.

Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today with a friend. We both got a salad, I got the balsamic salad with balsamic chicken and she got the sweet Roma and feta with regular chicken.

Ingredients were very fresh and the line was really long (because it just opened) but once I was able to order, I got my food pretty quickly. They forgot the feta on my friend's salad but regardless, the salads were good and were filling. The flavors and ingredients weren't anything special, however they were very fresh. A little overpriced in my opinion, but for the quality of the food that you get, I understand why their prices are what they are. The dining area is clean and the environment is very nice."}
{"text":"In the name of everything that is pure and righteous with this world, WHY would you try to do a fast food Italian place? I'm shaking my head as I type this because the food was SO BAD. I don't mean that it just didn't taste good, this stuff gave my husband and I the runs.

Besides the fact that pasta shouldn't be precooked and sit around just waiting to be served up to some unsuspecting person's plate, if you have to load it with as much oil as they do to keep it from sticking together, that should be your first clue that this is not a good idea. I wanted to run so far and so fast, but I was STARVING!!! And you know how when you're starving everything tastes good? Well, let me tell you, my friends, this did NOT taste good.

So, back to the oily, semi-hard-from-sitting-around-pasta. My husband and I got two different types of pasta bowls. The 'sauces' were SO overwhelming with herbs, more oil, creams, etc, that it basically left holes in our esophagus' and at the same time the flavor was so monotonous. It was like the movie groundhog day eating this bowl of pasta. The same. boring. bite. over. and. over.

And then you think, 'Oh, they gave me some flatbread filled with cheese and grilled as a side! Awesome!' Not awesome. Again, the amount of grease would choke a McDonalds french fry. And it was soggy. 

Ick. So gross. We couldn't even finish our meals. I can't even finish this because the thought of this place is making me sick. I would actually campaign against this place if I had the time. You could cater a party for me for free from this place and I wouldn't take you up on the offer.

I warned my mom about it and she went anyways. She got sick too. Another one bites the dust.

Don't believe the reviews on here. I don't get all the 4 and 5 stars. They are seriously from people who've never eaten real Italian food. So if you have no palette, enjoy frequent trips to the bathroom and an upset stomach all day, and you have no idea what good Italian food is, by all means, go to Piada!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and true to the street food name (being super portable, filling, and something that you could develop serious cravings for)! Everything tasted fresh and not as if it had been sitting in a fridge for a few days or under a heater. Meets were flavorful and tender and veggies were crisp and delicious. Also everything was prepared super quick and by very friendly and helpful staff!"}
{"text":"had the opportunity to attend soft opening and really impressed. the portions are ginormous with plenty for lunch the next day. the staff is helpful with what they recommend . Husband ordered Porchetta sandwich with pickled onions and cabbage and panchetta bacon.  he loved the combination.  comes with kettle chips with paprika and fresh Parmesean.  I ordered the angel hair pasta bowl.. Alfredo and basil.. ordered a grass fed meatball. huge beyond words. we will def be coming back so many choices and then pop over to cinemark movie theatre"}
{"text":".             ~  PIADA TRIFECTA ~

1.  If you want your pasta \"hot\", ask for it \"hot\".
Depending on when you order, how busy they've been, and when their freshly-cooked pasta has been added to serving containers, it (naturally) may be warm, not hot. This is totally understandable and acceptable for eating-on-the-go Italian street grub ordered from a counter---it's FAST food---not Italian restaurant-style with checkered table cloths, Sinatra and Pope pics on the wall, vino being poured, and aproned wait staff attending to tables.  If Piada KEPT pasta hot, it would only continue cooking, becoming softer and softer.  They wouldn't want this, and neither would we.  It makes for grown-up pasta---not mushy, fresh-from-the-can or frozen-box styles.  Now that you have a heads up, just ask them  They'll accomodate.

2.  6 suggested menu choices, a Create-Your-Own, 
.     and kiddie options, too.
Take your time.  Friendly hard-working staff are eager to take your order, but don't let that stop you from reviewing the menu board---not just quickly scanning---before deciding.   If it's busy, pick up their menu (if available) when you arrive, or read board while waiting in line.  And you can always check site beforehand.  mypiada.com   
    
3.  Choose from: Chicken, Steak, Calamari, Italian 
.     Sausage, Vegetarian, or Salmon, on/in any of 
.     these choices:
PIADA...thin crust, stone-grilled, and rolled; similar
.     to pita
PASTA...angel hair (capellini) thinner than spaghetti;
.     with garlic piada
SALAD...house-made dressings, with garlic piada
SOUPS & SIDES, too.
*** Pricing *** subject to change.  I've included should anyone---hmm---be unfairly exaggerating.   sm 6.50-8.95 (salmon)...reg 6.98-8.95 (salmon) 
...beverage not included.   Least expensive is 6.50 for small (generous) vegetarian pasta with sauce (seasonal fresh veggies) ---NOT $10.

Based on a high recommendation---just a few days after Piada opened---we stopped in for take-out.  Generally, we wait a month or two to try new places so any expected, naturally-occuring kinks and klunks can be worked out.  I also want to give NEW businesses a break---and room to breathe---(especially local, privately-owned, non-chain)---by NOT writing a negative review.  And even if warranted, I won't write ANY review.  And NEVER when it's a local biz's---be it newly-opened or established---FIRST review.  NEVER.  That's just cruel and unfair.  Thankfully, smart readers will see through especially harmful negative reviews for ANY business as coming from inexperienced angry-at-everything-and-anything, cynics.      

Newly opened businesses---right out of the gate---deserve at least a few laps around the lunch and dinner courses before negative losers tear up their bets and feverishily race to a keyboard.  Our first results weren't five star---but close---and only because of one of those expected mistakes from a newie.  This second visit---dine in---was just fine.  Serving staff was a quick-to-accomodate line of smiles, and Eric the manager, a really cool guy. 

What we thoroughly enjoyed ~

~~ PASTA...Chicken Basil Pesto
Excellent.  Perfectly al'dente; parmesan alfredo style with sundried tomatoes and shaved parmesan; regular size is VERY generous serving
~~ SALAD...Created our own (staff-assembled)
Excellent.  One of the best we've ever been served in a restaurant.  Spinach, Italian Sausage (chunks), onion, mushrooms, tomatoes, cucumbers, and spicy peppers; combination dressing was exceptional: 1/2 Italian & 1/2 Balsamic 
~~ BEVERAGE...Italian Lemon Tea ...delish.

~
Be open when reading negative reviews---especially for new businesses.  And if you have an issue with ANY business---play fair---SPEAK UP.   Give them the courtesy and opportunity to correct them---instead of steaming revenge over a laptop.  It'll just fog up your screen and your reasoning.

{"text":"So what do Mexican and Italian street food have in common? Some call it a burrito; others call it a piada. But everyone calls it yum-O in the tum-O! The overstuffed piadas are worth several visits to try the different variations as well as the MTO salads + pastas. The clean design, relaxed atmosphere and quick cafeteria style service all add up to a new Oakland food experience. One added bonus is that you feel young again being surrounded by all the university kids. Hail to Pi(tt)ada!"}
{"text":"I had been to the piada in rocky River a few years ago but didn't really look at the menu and didn't know what they had. I was looking for a food place and saw a piada sign and turned in to get the full experience. The staff here was phenomenal. Right when I walked in I was greeted by a lady in a chef coat and she took the time to explain the menu and what a piada was. The man who cashed me out was attentive and extremely polite. I will definitely be back just because of the way I was treated.. And the delicious food. Way to go south Euclid piada"}
{"text":"Maybe we just didn't order the right food, but I was disappointed with the quality of our pasta dishes, especially for the price. As we worked our way down the assembly line ordering process (akin to chipotle), they used a frying pan to mix our ingredients. I thought for sure they were going to then throw it onto a stove for a minute to heat everything up. Unfortunately, the pan was just a prop for the assembly line process, and our food ended up being lukewarm. The only thing I really enjoyed here was their \"Piada sticks\" which are really just pepperoni rolls in stick form. I think from now on if we want pasta, we'll just make it ourselves."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Fresh and healthy food that tastes delicious. Highly recommend. Their menu is unique and colorful. I live the fall harvest Piada with chicken."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure why it took us so long to get to this place since its about 2 minutes from home. Came for dinner on a Sunday and there was a line but it went really quickly. 

I really liked the way they designed the place, nice clean lines, simple decor. 

We ordered one vegetarian Piada and one chicken salad to share. The man at the stone very easily up-sold us on an artichoke Piada stick. 

The Piada wrap veggies tasted fresh and weren't overcooked. The pomodoro sauce accompanied them nicely. The actual Piada wrap thin but also had a little crisp to it. It was surprisingly good! The salad - boy they pack a lot of ingredients into that bowl! The salad was large and also very fresh tasting. The Skinny Vin dressing was a nice touch and they didn't overdress the salad. Chicken was nicely seasoned. And last, the artichoke piada stick - how can you go wrong with artichokes wrapped in cheesy goodness? Awesome. 

$20 for the whole thing. Pretty comparable to other similar restaurants. 

As a couple who frequents the Panera next-door more than I'd like to admit, I think this will be a nice addition to the repertoire. I'm excited about this place! Yum!"}
{"text":"Visited Piada today for lunch, and enjoyed it very much.  I order the chopped salad and my lunch partner the Piada.  I was really pleasantly surprised at how fresh and appetizing everything looked. And the portion size was huge.  And for a steak salad, with an array of toppings, for only $6.98?  That's a great deal.  Plus you can get as many toppings as you would like.   
I tried the Piada as well, but wasn't as impressed.  It looked and tasted like a burrito.  I thought their flatbreads would be more doughy, versus tortilla like.  Next time, I would like to try the pick two, check out their soup, and I'm very curious about the calamari.

Overall, not bad."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently opened, so when I went (around 7:30pm on a Wednesday) there was a long line. The menu has around 10 basic options with plenty of meat options, as well as side options. The ambiance is very nice and all the employees were very friendly! I ordered the diavolo pasta with crispy chicken and I was very pleased! The pasta is not undercooked or overcooked and the diavolo sauce (while a tad spicy) was delicious. The crispy chicken had great flavor and a nice crispy outside. You definitely get a solid amount of pasta for the amount you pay. Overall, I'd definitely come here again to try their piadas and salads!

**Fun tip: You can also ask to add pasta in your piada!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to give Piada a try for a long time now - I'm always driving by the University Heights location on my way to Legacy Village. I happened to be in Rocky River, was extremely hungry and noticed the location on Center Ridge. I went around 6:15 and was lucky to literally have been one of two people in line!

I love chipotle style places - I know some people don't because the food is all laying out, but I love made to order, right in front of you, see how fresh the ingredients are types of things!! You start off by deciding if you want a piada (sandwich/wrap thing), pasta bowl, or salad. I opted for the small vegetarian pasta bowl. They add some plain noodles to your bowl and you choose your protein and sauce - the diavolo sauce is wonderful! perfect amount of spice! Then you get to add all your wonderful toppings - there are SO many things to choose from and I think I almost got everything!! I ended up also getting the Piada garlic dough - I am not the biggest fan of garlic bread (I know, weird, right?) - but I loved this thing! Flat crispy folded over dough with cheese in between along with some garlic (paste? sauce?) and sprinkled with some garlic/salt/seasoning mix. These are literally fresh off the stove when you get them and it was absolutely DELISH!! The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the zucchini mix - it was WAY too salty! hopefully it was just a bad batch type of thing, but otherwise I enjoyed by entire meal!!

For my small pasta bowl and garlic dough, I paid about $8.00. I had leftovers even from the small so I would say that's a pretty good deal!

The employees were super friendly. I was a piada-virgin so took a while to figure out what I wanted and they were patient with me. I will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Love this little spot. Yes I know it is a chain- but not a huge one. The portions are huge and the prices are fair. Building your own bowl is great and the toppings are fresh. Great for lunch and/or dinner."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch with my colleagues. There was big line, but it moved pretty quickly. I should thank Yelpers? for piada suggestions. 

I made a good decision by ordering piada with crispy chicken. It is just like thin and crispy burrito made of pizza dough. I almost gave a five star, but I am not sure if they added olive oil or canola oil to toast the piada. 

I'll definitely go back again for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent grab and go pasta shop! Make your own pasta bowl. The meatballs are fantastic and service is great! This is a good family stop with kids. It is not a traditional sit in joint. No wine or formal Italian meals."}
{"text":"Im not a huge fun of my pasta bowls and their menu option piadas so I'm glad they give you the option to make your own Piada. If I'm gonna spend $8-9 on a wrap then I want to enjoy it to the fullest. I had a custom made Piada with grilled chicken and avocado. I like that you can pretty much add any kind of toppings for free so mixing and matching the flavors are fun. You can pretty much have a different set of flavors anytime you go. In addition to the Piada, I had the garlic flatbread as a side with the lemonade. It was a quite the satisfying lunch that kept me full well into the evening. I also like the rewards points program so you can end up getting a free meal just from points after 5 or so visits."}
