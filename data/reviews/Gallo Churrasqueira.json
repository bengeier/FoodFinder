{"text":"Great food, great value. Went to this restaurant just about every day throughout my days in High School. The food is amazing and the service is very friendly."}
{"text":"Went to try this place on a Wednesday for lunch and ordered half a Grilled Chicken w/rice and potatoes ($11.30 including tax). Surprised how large the portions were and had to save it for later. The Grilled chicken was tender and potatoes were soft however the rice was a little dry.  I recommend getting the Grilled Chicken combo but ask for extra sauce as they don't give much."}
{"text":"This is the best take out chicken you can find. I a not sure if this is because the source is halal or because the way they grill it. It is so tasty and fat free. The other food they have is also awesome. We tried the osso buco, veal stew, Beef stew, pork ribs and all were really good."}
{"text":"Food is tasty and they have a good deal for students! Rice isn't that amazing but whatever! Chicken is good!"}
{"text":"Went: Sat Sept 12, 2015, 6:30 p.m. (70/100) Ordered: half chicken dinner ($10) takeout Cost: $11.30 incl tip The place was very busy and there was a long line. There is limited tight seating and I am not sure it would be a good dining expereince. We were told that the chicken would take half an hour to prepare. This was sort of annoying but we decided that we could find a way to pass the time and pick up our order later. The sides -- in this case bean, salad and vegetables -- were very generous in portions. I did feel you got good value for $10 as the half chicken was quite large too. The bean salad was not well drained which made the bottom of the chicken wet with bean sauce and that negatively affected the experience. They did not give much sauce and it was identical to the jug of hot sauce I have at home, thought I find that jug very tasty. The chicken at Los Chicos Brasa in my area is hands down waaaay better.. Bottom line: it was good, but was not unique and did not wow or impress. Tasty bbq, grilled or rotisserie chicken will have a nice flavour even without sauce, and this did not and was quite bland without sauce. However, for the value you get, and it is convenient location for me, i might give another dish a try. I would definitely not go back for the average chicken though. Barely 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4.0."}
{"text":"The fish fillet dinner is amazing! I tried the paella but I did not find it as good as the fish fillet. The portions are large but when you factor in the price it is like paying for two dinners! This is my go to place for portugese food in vaughan."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant .5 of a star I would but I cant....   Pros: Rice was very good. Get a good amount for your money (sort of).  Cons: Grilled chicken was dry, potatoes were dry, they don't give you a sauce to help with the dryness. Spanish Paella was okay.. on the mushy side because its been sitting in the sauce and juices of the seafood, blah.   My Experience: the reason this review on this restaurant being so bad. I just went there today to buy food because I get my nails done by the corner salon in the plaza. Myself, my sister and niece walked in. I guess because we aren't Portuguese and don't speak the language we were given such horrible customer service. And they spoke english, so it wasn't a language barrier. No one was in the store when we walked in, and this was our first time ever in the store, so obviously let us read the damn menu and decide what we want. A short female worker with black hair - boy cut, tells us all the deals at once and keeps asking so what do you want? By this time another Portuguese customer comes in so we tell the worker to just take her order while we decide. She seemed to get a better tone and respect out of the worker. We order and we leave no biggie.   What ends up happening next is a joke and the reason I will never return to a pathetic business like this again. We are on the road maybe 5 mins after, my sister realizes she forgot her phone on the counter. Mind you my sister ALWAYS has her phone sound on, (she's one of those that will make you hear their basic apple ringtone lol even if you're in line at the mto). So basically never ever on silent. With traffic in Vaughan it was hard to turn around but with a total of 10 mins we've returned. I give my sister my phone and I told her to try to call her phone when you get in the restaurant, in case if anyone picked up the phone, you can call it right out of their pocket, but do so once we get there.   She runs in, asks the same rude worker if she seen her phone, she left it on the counter. The worker says \"no I don't think so\", so my sister is looking around to see if they have camera's, the worker then decides to walk forward (behind the counter), at this point my sister calls her phone from my phone and hears a vibrate, (again never on silent nor vibrate) and the worker has the nerve to respond \"oh this one?\". You're kidding me. She or whomever part of that low establishment obviously turned her sound to silent, but thank goodness she has it on vibrate. Not only are you incredibly rude to your customers who are of minority but you tried to hide their phone too? Get your sh*t together."}
{"text":"A take out shop that features Grilled Chicken as most Portuguese shops do.  There are some stools along the walls for a quick dine-in but most visitors do the regular take-away.  Quarter Chicken Dinner($7.00) with side of White Rice and Parisian Potatoes has nicely Grilled Chicken however the Sauce brushed on top and given on the side is not as SPICY as it looks or as wished for.  The White Rice is not my favourite as others offer Saffron Rice.  The Potatoes were fine the way they were given.  The Menu has a few more options such as Seafood Rice(Arroz de Marisco), Paella, Cod Fish(Bacalhau), etc...  Not my go-to Churrasqueira Chicken at this moment although they have a bit more juicier Chicken than my favourite spot."}
{"text":"I've never had Portuguese food before but I would imagine that it'd be as good as this place.  It's one of my relatives' favorite places primarily for their \"Flamed Grilled BBQ Chicken,\" and after trying it; I admittedly say that it won my vote.  As an Asian, you would normally eat chicken with rice, but you can just eat this chicken on its own.  It was meaty, juicy, and full of flavor.  Not to mention, their \"secret sauce\" was to die for.  It's all prepared fresh in house with healthy ingredients, which is probably what made the chicken taste so good.  As a matter of fact, we ordered extra sauce!  We also order a lot to make sure there were leftover... and they tasted just as good even the day after!"}
{"text":"I came here a sunday around 2pm.. I have been wanting to try this place for some time. I came here and wait about 5min. Although there were 4 people working at the counter not one asked me if I needed help. so I walked out and came back few seconds later.. again no atrention.. walked out.m came back a few minutes latee and Again ignored!!!!! i was like really?!! so you know I hope this place is reading this review and will pay more attention to people. I gave them 5 opportunitues stood and waited and no one cane to see me. So I left without tryinf and i guess just by looking at the quality of rice.. I think I will stick to pollio loco on Jane st. -_-"}
{"text":"Pulled into the plaza for a slice of pizza with the wifey but saw this place and decided to check it out.   Loads of fresh chicken on the grill and rotisserie. Decided to share a half chicken and 2 sides. Chicken was moist and tasty. Opted for the potatoes and Greek salad. Food was delicious. Total for $11 and change including a drink. What a bargain. If I lived closer I'd eat here all the time. Oh and their hot sauce was yummmm."}
{"text":"Not the best place for Portuguese chicken in Vaughan, but not the worst either. I've picked up food on a couple of occasions and have not been blown away by it. Don't get me wrong, the food is tasty and the staff are friendly and the prices are in line with other restaurants peddling the same food....it's just that the food (to me) tastes better at another restaurant a short drive away. Minimal in-house seating so it definitely is a  \"to go\" place."}
{"text":"Great value and good food!   of the Portuguese chicken places near my house this is the best by far! for $20 you can get the small family meal that is 1 chicken with Rice and potatoes. this is usually enough for a meal and lunches for the next day.  only tip is call ahead and they will usually tell you how long before your order will be ready, or they can have it ready for you when you need it."}
