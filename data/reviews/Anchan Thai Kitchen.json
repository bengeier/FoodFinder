{"text":"Wow this pad thai was bad. I ordered a pad thai for lunch thru Uber Eats and was excited to try this place for the first time. When I opened the container it sure looked good, and for the first few bites wasn't too bad, but then it just went downhill. Something in the pad thai tasted burnt and each piece of chicken was extremely dry. It completely lacked flavour to the point that I needed to add my own sauce. The worst part is that I specifically asked for it spicy and I really could not taste any spice at all. 
Maybe its because I'm so used to Pai, but I'll never come back here."}
{"text":"Anchan Thai used to be a decent Thai restaurant called Young Thailand. They claim to have used the old recipes and added some of their own dishes. We were the only ones in the restaurant on a Friday night but we had to walk up to the counter to place our order. I ordered a dish I used to order at Young Thailand, the Royal pad Thai as well as a tom yum soup and papaya salad. The papaya salad was a bit salty, but the soup was pretty good despite being small for $7. The Royal pad Thai was a big disappointment, it was way too sweet, it tasted like a dessert to me. Although we asked for medium spicy, there wasn't even a hint of spice. The prices are pretty high compared to other Thai places around the city and the quality of the food does not justify the price. I can't comment on their curry's or other dishes, but I don't think I'll be going back to try them out."}
{"text":"Location: King West. Street parking is available but check the signage. I was staying around the  corner so just walked over. 

The place: Nothing special. The decor reminded me of a buffet restaurant... It's fairly spacious but was empty when we went. 

The goods: OK well, I hate to leave mediocre reviews but I just wasn't blown away by this place. We ordered: spring rolls with shrimp, chicken satay, pad thai, mango salad and green curry (with chicken). Everything was served piping hot so we knew the food was made upon order. The spring rolls were OK - there was one shrimp at the bottom of the roll while the rest of it was filled with bean sprouts. The pad thai was not the best I've had. The noodles were really stuck together, the tofu seemed dry and it was hard to tell if the vegetables were fresh, though I did see a guy walking up with vegetables during dinner so.... maybe? I just had the impression that the tofu and vegetables had been pre-cut and left to sit for a while. Finally, it was pretty sweet. It was OK but I've had better. The satay was nice, as was the green curry. My friend loved the mango salad.  Overall, the food was OK but nothing to write home about. You can definitely find better, more authentic Thai restaurants in TO. 

Service: OK. 

Price point: I don't remember exactly but I think the pad thai was around $10 and the spring rolls were $4-5."}
