{"text":"Office workers know the drill -- you are too lazy to pack a lunch most days... so when lunch rolls around, you need to grab something decent and quick, and then get back to work.

This shop is one of my favorites around to grab a quick bite.  And I do so, a few times a week.

Breakfast or lunch, their value is very good.  Like a bacon and egg sandwich/English muffin (with the bacon piled shockingly high) for under 3 bucks.  

Or lunch time sandwiches -- where they use real roast turkey or roast beef (actually asking me how I want my beef done... medium rare to well).  With things like horseradish or cranberry sauce as available toppings.   Basically how I'd make my own \"gourmet\" sandwich at home with available leftovers.   

A piled high sandwich and soup for $6.75.  And unlike some of the other places around, they actually vary their soup offerings most days.

It's a family run business, with everyone pitching in to get people through as quickly as possible... so a long lineup doesn't mean a hopeless wait.

I probably couldn't do any better, or cheaper, if I packed my own lunches.  So thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. I was amazed at how fast the line went. First try was the triple decker clubhouse. Looked and tasted dandy. Price fits in my wife's budget which is nice too. It is either this place or weiner water soup again."}
{"text":"I get my lunch a few times a week at Rita Sandiwches and Catering, and there are a few reasons why I keep coming back.

1.  They are FAST.  Don`t let the size of the lineup intimidate you.  The lineup is there because its good, and it moves very quickly. The staff are efficient and quick.

2.  They have a large variety of breads, pitas and wraps.  There is no better way to jazz up a sandwich than switching up your breads.  You will definately have your choice if you need a change from your usual favorite.

3.  They are consistently good and fresh.  I have never seen a wilted piece of lettuce or anything nasty, in anything I have ordered there.  

4.  I am humored and touched watching them scoop soup.  When you think it isnt possible to get your bowl any fuller, they still keep scooping to get it to the rim.  Then they put the lid on it, wipe the container and hand it to you.  These folks do not chinz out on their servings of anything.  I havent tried any of their soups except for their wonton soup, but I love it.

This may not be a five star restaurant.  It is a deli.  However, they deserve 5 star rating based on the work they are doing there.  Ritas is awesome for both their food, their prices and their service.  Way to go, guys!"}
{"text":"This is my go to lunch spot for a sandwich or a wonton soup whenever I don't bring a lunch. It's a cute mom and pop shop and the prices are very reasonable for fresh homemade food.  They always fill the wonton soup to the rim with lots of wontons. The large soup is such a bargain for under $5.  I like that you can get fresh avocado with your sandwich.  This place is a hidden gem.   I've tried some of their other soups before and they were just as good."}
{"text":"Great value for money. Polite and efficient sandwich bar with everything made fresh. Dozens of types of bread, wraps, and deli ingredients. I stop here most days for lunch."}
{"text":"Had my lunch today @ Rita Sandwiches.  I decided to get a half Roasted Turkey (white meat) sandwich with cranberry sauce on brown bread.  You can select the many types of vege to add to your sandwich.  My sandwich was delicious and fresh!  I also had their Chicken Noodle soup.  It was not bad but I was quite thirsty after the soup.  It's either lots of msg or lots of salt.  

There is quite an extensive hand-written menu on a board.  There are specials of the day on a chalkboard as you enter the restaurant.

I'm coming back to try the shrimp and avocado sandwich!!"}
