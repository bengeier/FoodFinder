{"text":"DELICIOUS! I'm always the person that tries different things then regret it BUT not this time! I ordered the Korean nachos and O.M.G! Probably one of the best things I've ate in a long time! The service was very fast and friendly! I can't wait to try them again!"}
{"text":"Holy homemade chips. Don't leave the truck without them.   Also the bahn mi sandwich was very good and flavorful!"}
{"text":"Tried this truck today at work. Just finished eating my meal and had to jump on Yelp and leave a review. I ordered the Korean Nachos based on Patricia R's review below. She was right on the money. They were AMAZING! The beef was tender, flavorful, and had just the right amount of seasoning. Serving size was respectable. Looking forward to trying the other menu items!"}
{"text":"I tried this food truck at the Clark Park farmers market. They had about 4 items on the menu: a green chili burrito, breakfast sandwich, Vietnamese pork loin wrap, and something else I can't remember.... I tried the pork loin wrap and I thought it was great! The pork was so flavorful and I loved the arugula and other stuff inside the wrap. I thought the price was reasonable for the quality of food. I hope they come to the farmers market again!"}
