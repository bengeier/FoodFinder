{"text":"I agree with a number of the other reviewers in regards to MELANGE'S atmosphere: I'm generally not a fan of eateries with dark lighting, but they pull it off well. That's about all the points I can give them.  I went there with a date for Valentine's Day, because they offered a holiday special on Facebook (3 courses for two for $29.99, inc. salad, main course of crab cakes, chicken parmesan, or lasagna, and dessert), which seemed great. My date also had a discount card for there which she was hoping to apply toward our meal. Not knowing how busy they would be, I agreed to call ahead to make reservations.  I called several times during the course of the day on Valentine's Day and no one ever picked up. If you can't answer your phone, you must not be interested in potential business.  When we arrived around 5:15pm, there was practically no one there, which surprised us. The music was up very loud, and was typical banal club fare. We took a booth, and were eventually waited on by the lone bartender. She was nice, but in short order we found out they didn't actually have their advertised V-Day special available (because \"their food hadn't been delivered\" for the day, but we could wait to see if that changed), we couldn't use our discount card because of the holiday (even though there was no one else there to speak of), their food menu was limited to bar munchies, and they only had three kinds of wine.  Lame.  One more quibble: the bartender kept running her hands through her hair, which was very long and dark. This may have just been a habit on her part, but I'm particular about my food, and the thought of this person potentially serving my food after playing with her hair grossed me out. That's just a big no-no.  We ordered two drinks and and went to get actual food at CAFE MILANO, right down the street. With a host of choices in Downtown Pittsburgh, a number of which being right along Penn Avenue and less than a block from here, I doubt I'll try MELANGE again."}
{"text":"We walked in and were seated in a completely empty room on a Saturday at 11:30am... All 5 water glasses were dirty. They were replaced and one water came with floaters in the glass. The coffee was not drinkable, in fact it was cold and the tea pot had no lid and not enough water. And the OJ was not good, they put so much ice in it. Our menus had dried food on them. When the server came to take our order she asked if we were ready and we said yes then she said she didn't have a writing utensils. At that point we left. Horrible experience and will not return."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night in July, and surprisingly the restaurant was very empty (830p) I was unsure if they were having an event and might have been closed to the public and were just waiting on guests to arrive.  With that being said, they have a very varied menu with foods for all tastes, I got the flank steak, it was delicious, as were the cherry tomates which were soaked in balsamic to give them a very fruity flavor.  It has a nice atmosphere, I would be interested to see how it looks full of patrons but it seems like a place you could go for either a romantic night out or for an after work outing.  I would recommend this for anyone who wants to have a little bit more of a classy meal."}
{"text":"Fun bar but the food is not so great. Salads are pretty good, but stay away from the Jerk Chicken skewers. They have no spice on them. Just very bland grilled chicken. The guy really needs to visit Nagril (Jamaica) and buy some real Jerk Chicken from a late night street vendor."}
{"text":"Happy hour only review, coming right up!  The happy hour here is absolutely delectable! (I say this in confidence and you should believe it because I don't think delectable is an often appropriate word and sounds funny.) A friend and I are addicted to happy hours and this one is in the top ranks, for sure. I love the way the prices change with the hour, but so do the portions and choices.   We ordered from each section and got the fried pickles, the fries and the chicken and waffles. The fried pickles were fantastic! I never would have expected Melange to have such great fried pickles and french fries, but oh my gosh, I devoured those fried foods and felt fancy at the same time! Cocktail in hand, fried pickle in the other, how can you go wrong?! I think I've found my cocktail bar soulmate. The chicken and waffles were good too (no Zanzibar, but I didn't expect soul food here either!).  We didn't really have any problems--I can't remember what we had to drink, but they were pretty delicious. The bartender seemed to be a little cranky though and didn't really pay much attention to us. I don't require a lot at a bar, but I like it when bartenders are at least a little chatty and fun. She seemed a little preoccupied with the people that were next to us and it was pretty obvious that they knew each other. I can't complain too much, because everything was fine, but it was still off-putting. It certainly won't stop me from coming back for more pickles. :)"}
{"text":"Great food. Last time we were here the dishes were way too salty. They really turned it around. The calamari was to die for and the butternut squash ravioli was divine"}
{"text":"I heard good things about Melange, and booked a table for brunch.  Frankly - not so impressed.  My \"breakfast potatoes\" were frozen hashed browns - my breakfast quesadilla was skimpy on fillings, and as I did not enjoy the dipping sauce - way too bland.  I wish the quesadilla had more veggies, eggs, cheese, something!  Anything!  My friends had an omelet and eggs in a hole, and both seemed to enjoy them more.  No fresh OJ was available, and the coffee could use an upgrade - for the money spent, this brunch was not worth my time or cash.  For two people, my bill including tip was close to $40.00, and the only items beyond the entree that we ordered was coffee."}
{"text":"Akil, our waiter was great. The calamari - awesome. I loved my filet and the potatoes with it. My husband had a decadent rissotto dish. We both loved it!"}
{"text":"We ate at this place on two occasions. April 13, and on April 28. It was excellent. We had the chicken salad on rolls and the past time we all had the veg. Pasta. Excellent, excellent. Service was very good and the drinks were wonderful. Very affordable"}
{"text":"This review applies to lunch only.  This place has great atmosphere, but the food was inconsistent.  I had a tandoori chicken wrap.  The chicken itself was super great with a surprising hint of cardamom, but the rice in the wrap was underseasoned and could have used some sort of relish or condiment.  Also the complementary bread seemed like it had been toasted to restore \"freshness\" rather than being fresh.  The butter was ice cold to the point of being crunchy.  The service was friendly enough but slow, I would guess it will take some time to iron out those kinks.  I will give it another shot to see if they have improved in a few weeks."}
{"text":"Love Melange - especially for lunch. . .and happy hour (go figure).  Sophisticated without being stuffy, Melange is perfect for a mid-afternoon or post-work dining experience. Imagine a chic setting with a mellow ambiance - enjoy modern jazz music playing softly surrounded by gentle, dim lighting.   The menu blends comfort with delicacy - the Lobster BLT is INCREDIBLE and the \"Dirty Chips\" (ie - homemade  sweet potato/beet chips w/ bleu cheese, pancetta, tomato and scallions) are irresistible.   Happy hour is an absolute steal: $5 menu items throughout the 5 o'clock hour and $6 menu items throughout the 6 o'clock hour.  Do yourself a favor and get the Tempura 3 ways: Lobster, Pork, and Green Beans which is a light and satisfying platter of amazingness. Not to mention, an array of imaginative martinis for $6 - for wine and craft beer drinkers, there are some excellent options as well.  Go to Melange for a romantic date or for a quiet drink - I wouldn't be surprised if you fall in love.  Bonus: If you are a Bank of America employee (like my husband is), enjoy a 10% discount off your bill."}
{"text":"I met a friend at Melange about a month and a half ago.  She saw online that they had pretty good happy hour food specials.  When I walked in to meet my friend the hostess rolled her eyes at me when I told her I was meeting a friend.  I found my friend at the bar.  The restaurant was dead and we were meeting at 6:00 pm.  There were a group of 3 at the bar and a small group of business men across the restaurant.  I decided not to get a drink as I was short on money.  I felt pressured by the bartender to get a drink and she kept asking.  It seemed like a manager who took our order.  I asked a few questions about the happy hour menu.  He responded to me like I was dumb.  Both my friend and I decided on the small burger plate.  The food took a while to come out, even though the restaurant was dead.  The manager brought our food out finally and it was not what I ordered.  He ran away so fast I did not have the chance to tell him.  My friend and I waiting to flag him or the bartender down, but no one was to be seen for several minutes.  Once I spoke to the manager I felt as though it was my fault that I was given the wrong food and I found myself apologizing.  Once I received my correct food it was decent.  The food tasted good and was prepared as an upscale restaurant, but it was nothing to rave about.  This was only my second time at the restaurant.  The first time was when it first opened.  My family and I were very disappointed in the food and service that time as well.  I will not be back to Melange again.  Even if the food was decent the service here is horrible and snooty."}
{"text":"Melange has always been a staple for my special occasions and evenings spent with my loved ones and family. I have eaten here frequently and the service was never bad, moderately attended to as most restaurants do. This last outing was truly atrocious as far as our server. Besides neglecting me and my guests most of the dinner hour we where barked and spoken to as if children and insignificant patrons who needed to eat and leave. Understandable if the server had a bad night or was under pressure with other tables. This evening though was not that, she was rude, not apologetic to not just our table but the other few that she was covering. Eventually the manager stepped in. Thankfully the food as always was divine."}
{"text":"The Yelp ratings seem to fit this restaurant well:  It is certainly A-OK & bordering on yay I'm a fan.  The good news was the bang for your buck.  We got a nice brunch for two & walked out the door for ~$25 with boxes full of the leftovers.  The french toast was as expected and the breakfast quesadilla was slighly better than something you would make at your house.  The bad news was the service.  We had a guy serving us & 1 or 2 other tables, yet never seemed to available to help us out.  We had to request ketchup, salsa, butter, extra syrup & re-fills on our drinks.  Upon request, we had to wait 5 minutes or so for him to come back with it.  And to top it all off, he dropped a \"sorry, it got real busy\" line on us - as if we couldn't see him tending to his other 2 tables in the area. Because the food & value aren't dependant on the wait staff, I would recommend the place - just beware if you see Charlie."}
{"text":"I'm happy to see that Melange has survived to see its 3rd birthday!  The kinks in the service and food seem to have been completely straightened out.  I enjoyed a great dinner and some live music this past week and was happy to see the restaurant so crowded.  They feature a great $5 drink list on Thursday nights, which takes the guesswork out of which items on the regular drink menu might be on special."}
{"text":"Our first sign that this was a bad choice should have been the fact that in a place that seats around 100, we were the ONLY ones there. I read a very nice review of this place on Pittsburgh Live (http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/lifestyles/fooddrink/s_619820.html), but now am skeptical of the reviewers motives. The review made this place sound like it was a hip new addition to the Pittsburgh food scene, but really it's more like a not so hip new addition to the tired old ideas executed poorly scene (okay, that was lame).   But seriously, for the price and the hype, I was expecting a lot more. So let's begin with the decor. You walk in and things seem nice and posh. Dark lighting, classy tables and chairs...the works. But then you start looking at the art and it's of various sports? I get that we live in a sports centered city, but now I just think that Melange is a glorified sports bar, not a classy eatery. And if it's a sports bar, how can they justify charging ~$30-40/person? So perhaps they need to think about their identity a bit.  Next, we move on to the service, which, for the most, part was okay, but given that we were the ONLY party in the restaurant, wasn't exactly stellar. Our waiter was very nice and made no substantial mistakes, but when I asked for a wine recommendation (they have three Malbecs...which I tend to love), he named something else all together (thinking that it was a Malbec) and then back peddled when he realized that I saw he was making it up as he went along. He recommended a good wine, but my experience is that those are all good, so really the credit does not go to him. Then, when our main dishes came out (4 of which were meat dishes) he forgot to bring our steak knives. Again, wouldn't have been a problem, but our butter knives were covered in...well...butter. So probably not a good idea to reuse them. Then, it turned out that they only had 2 clean steak knives in the entire place. Really? Again, keep in mind that we were the only people there and it was 7:30pm...not exactly right after opening. So yah, service was so-so.  Finally, the pièce de résistance, the food (please note the sarcasm). A few us ordered the chili lime quesadillas (which sounded great...see photo), but the chef apparently forgot the chili and the lime. They were as bland as anything I've eaten in a long time. On to the main dish. I ordered pork tenderloin (see photo) which was actually not too bad. The sauce was sweet (I like that) and the meat was cooked just right. So, on that front, well done. But my girlfriend ordered the lamb (the most expensive dish on the menu) and it was completely boring...and a little cold. I usually love to pick at food on her plate, but this time I had no such inclination. Sorry love, but that one is all yours :-p  Some of the other dishes were okay, but not great. A friend got the walnut salad and said it was tasty. Another friend got the wasabi popcorn and enjoyed it as well. So I can't say that ALL the food was bad, but the majority was. And for the price, not even close to being worth it.  Melange needs to decide if they are a glorified sports bar, an upscale eatery, or just a passing fad. Regardless, as it stands, I can't see this restaurant surviving too long. Given that it's across the street from the PSO, I'd happily see this one go to be replaced by a restaurant that deserves the prime location."}
{"text":"Melange. Oh, melange. How you disappointed me.  After seeing their deal on groupon, I decided to buy the $40 dollar coupon for a meal when my parents would come into town for the holidays.   The decor of Melange is nice. A nice cozy restaurant to have a dinner with the parentals at.   We were seated quickly (restaurant was rather empty when we walked in), and the bread came out for us to snack on. My mom really liked the large pita chips that came in the bread bowl.... I didn't really care for the spreads- the honey butter, the black bean spread. Eh. They were alright.  My mom ordered the lobster ravioli. It was probably the best dish of the nice- great sauce, a good amount of lobster that wasn't overcooked...good. I got the seared ahi tuna. Oh man, I didn't really like it. Don't get me wrong- the tempura beans and crab fried rice were alright...but the tuna. It just....didn't taste right. Maybe it wasn't raw enough? Fresh enough? It just.. I'm not sure what it was. I mean, I didn't get sick or anything...it just didn't taste that fresh or raw? I don't know.  My dad's dish did us in for the night. He had ordered the short rib and gnocchi...and it came out way way too salty. It seemed like they had dumped a canister of salt in it. I told my dad to complain (no way he could eat that), and he ordered the pork tenderloin sweet potato dish, which was actually pretty good. The waiter was nice about it...but man, that dish was really bad and really salty.  Overall, this restaurant is okay. I mean, I give it a few minuses- the wrong waiter came to our table with the wrong dish, the bill was wrong coming out, we had to flag the waiter down to come to our table, etc...but overall, it was alright. I give it 2.75 stars."}
{"text":"Bonus - Melange serves Sunday AND Saturday brunch. The menu includes the standard brunch fare but also some non-traditional plays on the favorites. I had \"eggs in the whole\" baked into challah french toast. The syrup had a little unexpected kick with truffle oil. Sweet. Salty and absolutely fabulous."}
{"text":"Much improved since our previous visits. Menu is more sophisticated; atmosphere classier (the servers and hosts are now much better dressed than the clientele).  Reuben pave was a brick of shredded corned beef on a bed of caraway-flecked mashed potatoes, with sauerkraut and a pool of tangy sauce.   Burger came with pickled red onions and fried green tomato, stacked high. Nicely prepared.   Fries are wide, shallow planks. Were done to a perfect crisp with reuben; a little flaccid with the burger."}
{"text":"Meh, I'm really not impressed.  I haven't eaten here yet....and I would give the food a try at some point.  I just didn't have the best service when I've visited and that's oh so important to moi.    I went for a quick stop in before the Pirates game.  The Happy Hour special is actually really great with them offering $2 drafts.  The service, however, left much to be desired.  I'm pretty much blind and can never see the tap choices unless they're right in front of me.  So I asked the bartender if he could let me know what was on tap.  He started to name them off facing the opposite direction of me.  I couldn't hear him to save my life, so I asked him to repeat it.  He let out an exasperated sigh and repeated them while facing the opposite direction, AGAIN!  I gave up and got the only drink I barely heard, the Blueberry Pilsner.  It was ok, but I was frustrated, so I didn't really get what I wanted.  I do love the front area of the space with the openness of the front windows for the summer months.  Is it bad to want to try a place only for their decor?  I shall be back to try the food, so I'm warning you Melange, don't disappoint me again!"}
{"text":"As a Disclaimer in the interest of full disclosure one of my friend's father is the General Manager of this restaurant.  It is not going to affect my review as I wouldn't waste my time on here if I wasn't acting in the interest of giving my unbiased opinion about the places I review.  That being said.... I went there today for lunch and its a nice slightly upscale place and was pleased to find that they serve a full lunch menu along with a very nice and creative breakfast menu.  I had an omelet which you can create your own and it was very nice sized came with hash browns and toast and I'd say its just as good of an omelet as you can get anywhere else.  Mine was spinach, mushrooms and sausage with provolone cheese.  The omelet was filled with plenty of toppings which is nice.  I have heard that the Bananas Foster French Toast is excellent however not being a huge banana fan I wasn't very intrigued although I probably would consider it on a visit again.  Being a breakfast person I unfortunately didn't spend much time looking at the lunch menu to be able to give too many details on it but I remember seeing several salads and at least a salmon entree.  I had been there once before probably close to when it first opened for dinner and the meal was pretty good nothing to brag about.  But this most recent experience would definitely make me reconsider trying it for dinner and I'm definitely a fan now that I know they serve breakfast as well."}
{"text":"To be honest, the only reason why I visited was to try it, and was using a $25 gift certificate as a reason. That said, I don't think this will be a regular restaurant for me to visit. I wanted to like it, the decor was inviting and spacious but the food was only so-so for me. I started with the smoked salmon latkes, while good quality, the dish was ok. I moved on to the \"new duck\" for my entree with cherry wine reduction sauce and sweet potato puree. It was way too sweet. I ended up scraping off the sauce and not touching any of the puree. Also, the duck was undercooked (red, not pink) and ended up taking it home and nuking it in the microwave the next day. Also, when I read reviews, the bread was all the rave but unfortunately my table never received any. I saw other diners get a basket, and it LOOKED delicious."}
