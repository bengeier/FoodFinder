{"text":"Great sashimi.  Thought I'd test the so called \"world class\" tuna melt, like there really is such a thing, but if one wants to use great tuna then possibly,  but otherwise not world class by any  means except the tuna, which great, but then really just a great piece of tuna between 2 sliced of bread.... Hard to beat a \"real\" tuna melt folks!  Especially for the price!"}
{"text":"2 stars = Meh. I've experienced better.

So i have to give it two stars cause i've experienced better. Long story short I dont really think it was worth the price. My vegetables and rice were cold and I wish I would have walked over to Ethel's for dessert."}
{"text":"half a step above Red Lobster, but that's about it.  My wife's crab cakes looked like soemthing from a Mrs. Paul's package.  The oysters were good...but then other than not serving them fresh, how can you screw up an oyster.  
I doubt that I'll return."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. July 2013 my companion and I both ordered the mahi mahi and loved it. The atmosphere was great and walking around the District afterwards is always fun .

We returned in February 2014 for dinner again, this time I ordered a steak and he ordered a seafood medley. The seafood was great. The steak - bad. I ordered it pink/medium and it came well done and dry. Later we both suffered gastro distress (full on food poisoning symptoms for me), presumably from the seafood, as that was the only dish we shared.

We'll probably be back, since its a favorite for out of town guests. But our dinner selections may stay on the safe side."}
{"text":"As a general rule of thumb, we haven't found any really good seafood west of the Mississippi. Certainly, Californians will tell you that they have good seafood there, but everything we've had there, from San Diego up to Fisherman's Wharf, just doesn't seem to have the same flavors as that found along the Atlantic seaboard. Kings Fish House in Henderson comes the closest so far since many of the dishes they prepare are made with seafood imported from the east coast.

We were in the Henderson and were planning to eat at Lucille's, but the wait in line was longer than normal so we thought we'd give this place a try. It was an early Saturday afternoon and surprisingly the place was empty considering the wait in line at Lucille's. We were quickly seated and since there were only 2 or 3 other occupied tables when we arrived, we pretty much had the waiter all to ourselves. We'd have to rate the service as 5 stars because of this, but if the restaurant was full, it might not have been as good. The menu is filled with items from all over the world-from Ecuadorian Mahi Mahi to Maine lobster to Alaskan halibut. So many choices, so little time-looks like this is going to be another of those restaurants that requires multiple trips.

After some deliberation I went with the New England Clam Bake which included a 1 14 lb. Maine lobster, steamed clams and mussels, red potatoes and corn on the cob. Brenda had the crab cakes. It didn't take long for the food to arrive--after all, how long does it take to steam some clams and boil a lobster? The crab cakes weren't great, but they weren't bad either. Better than what you can find in your frozen food aisle, but definitely nowhere close to what you can get along the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. The lobster was pretty good even though a bit on the small side. The clams and mussels were ok, but could have been better if they used mollusks from somewhere other than the Pacific...perhaps, I don't know, maybe NEW ENGLAND in their New England Clam Bake?!?

Don't get us wrong. This may not sound like a great review of the restaurant, but the food was good and we'll definitely go back again. Everything we had was better than the seafood at any of the buffets in town. However, having grown up on the east coast where we could get fresh seafood right off the boats, my tastes may be a bit jaded."}
{"text":"Once again great food and excellent customer service by Joe Salerno 
Always happy to spent time at king's Fish House. 
Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! Super yummy food and awesome staff especially Twyla and Mo! We have them serve us every time we come here and they make the experience even more amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to venture out from my normal Flemings and give this place a try ..food was great but will definitely bring me back is the amazing service I had my waitress her name lacy was absolutely amazing friendly and very knowledgeable gave great recommendations will definitely be back but only if she is my server ..."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the District was built.  I used to look forward to eating at Kings.   It is doubtful I will eat here again.  They have ruined the blue cheese & walnut salad.  The guacamole was insipid.  The waitress was pushy, randomly recommending items to drive up the meal cost.  (Have had good service in the past from Ben.)  Very, very disappointed.  The previous time I ate at Kings another member of the party was disappointed.  Too bad."}
{"text":"3 stars is about right. The service was great. No complaints there. However, nothing about the food is great. The calamari was greasy. The lobster bisque was not good. I exchanged it for the clam chowder, which had a slight taste of uncooked flour. If the prices were cheaper I'd consider an extra star. When you go out to have an $85 meal you expect more."}
{"text":"The Naked cowboy oysters were delicious. really got a kick out of our server Debra
she was great!"}
{"text":"Great! 2 adults and 2 kids Plus a baby- seated promptly (Monday, 6/21/10, but it was busy around 7:30pm). Sat inside for the air conditioning, outside seemed full and had water misters to keep you cool. We had oysters on the half shell-excellent (Otter Cove from the Hood Canal in Puget Sound, WA), steamed mussels-excellent, small Caesar salad-great except the croutons were way too hard, curry shrimp entree-excellent (I know, why curry in a fish house, in fact I almost slapped my wife when she ordered it, but it really was great, I'll deal with her later). Kids had fish and chips and pasta with butter and Parmesan cheese-they loved it all (ages 6 and 7). Service was friendly, our server seemed a little new to the business-wasn't too savvy or confident, but he did a good job and didn't bug the sh** out of us like some servers do.  This was a \"happening\" spot, with tile floors so it was a little noisy, but if you want quiet, go to bed! We did not think it was overly loud. They also had a nice looking sushi bar we will try next time we are there on vacation."}
{"text":"Had A great experience.  Food was awesome!  Honey ordered lobster and steak!  The lobster was unique with a Cajun twist!  I ordered the broiled Yellowfin Tuna!  Perfect!  Waitress recommended the calamari, but honestly it was a bland. we went there last week and had lunch at the bbq place. love the vibe of that area very nice.  and when the kids just get a little bigger that playground will be awesome for them :)Love that you can sit outside."}
{"text":"Haven't found a lot of seafood places I like, but server Joe Salerno was very kind and helpful. Joe recommended the filet mignon and lobster tail. Must say, it was very delicious. Great food and service, will be coming back to Kings again soon."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good lunch spot in a District on a chilly Saturday afternoon and this time keyword was... \"seafood\". So there we were... seated in this fine establishment. 

After looking through the menu and questioning the server we decided to go for an Oyster sample and variety of entr√©es with few glasses of wine.

According to my friends (accomplished oyster eaters) sampler was excellent to the point of ordering more oysters of some specific origin (sorry... but I don't remember which one in particular). The cocktail sauce and freshly grated horseradish that comes with it is also a nice touch.

I've ordered sauteed scallops with potatoes and grilled vegetables. They were properly cooked and flavorful.

Halibut (from specials menu) was OK according to my friend but nothing to write home about. Shrimp/Crab cocktail wasn't great either.

We also got Creme Brulee for dessert which was actually really good.

Damage: ~$200
+ Great place for oysters
+ Close to my new house
- Pricey, but after reading reviews I realized that we could probably cut our bill for 1/3 if we brought our wine.... oh, well.
- We got seated right away but service was rather slow. Good thing we were not in a hurry."}
{"text":"I had the Coconut Curry Shrimp, and my partner had Idaho Rainbow Trout. Both dishes were excellent! Even the Buttered Sweet Corn was delicious. The place is a tad expensive, but the food and decent service make it worthwhile."}
{"text":"Bland and flavorless food.  Service that could be expected at Denny's.
The only highlight of our dinner was the Clam Chowder.

Complimentary sourdough bread - good.
Clam Chowder - excellent.
Crab Cakes - bland, dry, cheap and previously frozen taste to them, only edible if drenched in tartar sauce.

$41/lb King Crab Legs - horrible, over cooked, dry, flavorless, did not taste fresh.
Parmesan Crusted Mahi - oily and flavorless.
Mac N Cheese - ok, nothing special.
Garlic Mashed Potatoes - ok, could've had more galic and salt to flavor.
Jasmine Rice - regular rice.
Grilled Zucchini - good, can't complain.

Overall, we are glad that we are not missing out on anything other than Lucille's BBQ considering we live 30 minutes from The District."}
{"text":"Great Great Great!!!!

The food is awesome, the staff is better.  Been coming here for a long time and never had a bad experience.

I get the swordfish and always start off with the Ceviche and the Shrimp cocktail."}
{"text":"Great value and an outstanding variety of fresh oysters and seafood. When you can try to make it in for their live spiny lobsters they are a real treat very sweet and full of flavor. I really enjoy Kings as a whole. They offer a large menu with variety and a seasonal section to keep things fresh."}
{"text":"Our first time here.  LOVED the Poke Seafood Salad.  Reminded me of Hawaii!  Awesome service from Celeste too.  So professional and friendly.  She made the whole experience memorable.  We're coming back for more!!!"}
{"text":"The crab cakes were AMAZING! Best I ever had, the clam chowder was pretty good, the mac n cheese was good and sweet corn(omg bomb) the south Africa lobster was so delicious and had a sweet taste to it.
The service was great Jeremy (waiter) did an excellent job and was very funny and had plenty of energy, he actually put me in a better mood.

Now with all that being said I didn't enjoy the blackened mahi mahi to much I don't know what was going on with that but either I made a bad choice or the chief dropped the ball. It can be a bit pricey but I would come back here again. 

Cheesecake was goooooood"}
{"text":"Shrimp taquitos were great. The chicken sandwich I had was really juicy - not dry like most. Clam chowder also tasty. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The customer service is mediocre at best.  The food is probably one of the worst seafood/fish restaurants I've ever experienced.  Just save yourself the money and don't go there."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed dining here. Great service, atmosphere & food!"}
{"text":"Most of the food here is acceptable, but not spectacular. The wait staff is not overly attentive, and a bit slow at times. Thus the overall rating is much lower than it could be. The food somewhat makes up for a poor service when taking into consideration you are eating at a chain restaurant.

I have eaten here on several occasions and will go again, but as I said it is not my favorite place for a nice night out with my spouse.

Last night I had the lobster tail and sirloin. My spouse had the coconut crusted mahi mahi. For an appetizer my spouse and I shared a Spicy California Roll from the Sushi bar. I started out with a nice cold beer, but was disappointed when the glass was dirty and still had lip prints on it from a prior customer. 

The complimentary bread was tasty, although it was not hot like it has been on previous trips to King Fish. 

The sushi was good, although both my spouse and I felt the seaweed was a bit tough and chewy. Perhaps the sushi chef was having an off day or perhaps they are using a low quality Nori seaweed, at any rate I give the sushi a C+.

My sirloin was cooked properly and had a nice rich beefy flavor. The lobster tail was obviously frozen, but cooked properly and did not need to butter sauce to enhance the flavor. The spinach side was sauteed with roasted garlic and had a wonderful flavor. I give my meal a B.

I had a bite of my the fish my spouse ordered and it was cooked just right with a nice rum butter toasted coconut crust. She said her food was properly cooked and enjoyable. She gives her meal a B.

The waitress asked if we wanted dessert and when we told her we did not she recommended we order something to go. We politely declined, but I give her points for upselling the menu. 

If you are going to have dessert the Chocolate Cake is worth while as is the Key Lime Pie. I have eaten both of them on prior trips to King Fish.

Overall the Kingfish is a B-, just above average but worth going to every now and again. If they would fix the issues with poor service and slow staff I would bump this up to a B or B+."}
{"text":"Ben is a fantastic server!! Very knowledgable. The tuna melt is better than you'd expect."}
{"text":"Ordered a hot combo plate, lobster bisque and crab cocktail. Lobster bisque is sooooo salty...cannot even finish. The hot combo is fine, but not any impressive"}
{"text":"Got the popcorn shrimp simple but delicious

Great place for someone who likes sushi"}
{"text":"Thanks so much Scott for creating such a great experience tonight for my family and I. Your menu suggestions were wonderful try's. We cannot wait to come back, and will be requesting you to serve us again!"}
{"text":"When you have a great server it makes the whole experience better. Ben was our server he was very knowledgeable about the menu and extremely nice and friendly. The food was delicious. We started with fried calamari, lobster bisque and had the wild salmon - fabulous.  It's a great evening."}
{"text":"I love Kings! The food is always amazing. I love that they give you delicious bread to start the meal. My favorite place to sit is in the bar area. I have had several different servers and they have all been great. Whenever I'm in Henderson I make sure this is one of my places I dine at first."}
{"text":"First visit to this location.  Mahi Mahi and Salmon were both tasty!  Service....One quick glance up from the table and my server was there checking on me.....Thanks Muhammed (sp)!"}
{"text":"Great food and service,  thanks Mohammed! The drinks were great and it was so nice to be able to sit outside on this beautiful night!"}
{"text":"Amie was an awesome server! She made sure to keep my drinks refilled and attentive! Great food and service!"}
{"text":"nice location. food prices high for portion sizes. swordfish strip was alright and the potato was undercooked. management was less than friendly. Didn't want to deal with what I had to say and it seemed like it was just brushing me off."}
{"text":"Used to be a favorite of mine and my family. Whether it's due to the season or the restaurant budget, they removed pretty much all the reasons I liked coming here from the menu, and especially no more lobster bisque. Complaint from my family member is too much bacon and lack of clams in clam chowder as well as the lack of items that aren't farm raised. Very sad to say we probably won't be coming back to what was our favorite seafood place."}
{"text":"Came here after work yesterday with some coworkers, and was very impressed.  Great alternative to eating on the strip.  Price was a little more than I'm used to spending in California, but it was expected seeing as though the seafood is flown in.  Had the crab cocktail....drool, three types of oysters.....more drool, and the clam bake....heaven.

Will come again when I have the money to blow!  Nice atmosphere, it was still warm out, so we sat on the patio (where you can smoke).  Seafood goodness."}
{"text":"My husband and I head straight for King's whenever we are in the mood for their amazing trout. It is prepared in the most delicious manner with lemon caper butter sauce and is always expertly grilled to perfection. Their raw oysters are fresh and delicious,and they get a great variety of oysters from all over the USA and Canada. We also recommend the delicious fried oyster appetizer,good for two to share. They serve an incredible warm sourdough bread that is best if you tell the waiter to toast it. The sushi is also very high quality and sustainability is very important to my husband and me when it comes to eating raw fish. We love the philosophy of the owners when it comes to serving only sustainable seafood that is not overfished. The service here can be very good but it can also be spotty at times. The ambience is busy, noisy and there is a huge outdoor patio that opens onto a pedestrian only plaza that many people enjoy. It's got space heaters in the winter and misting in the summer.  They have specials when certain seafood is available for a limited time such as their soft shell crabs, which are offered in 3 separate preparations, fried, saut√©ed and Asian tempura style with two sides (May- July) and lobster which is also served a variety of ways. It is best to call for a reservation on weekends as this place gets very crowded. Weekday evenings are usually easy to get without a reservation."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure to eat there for free. And wow was the food amazing, My appetizer was a dozen small oysters that I seasoned with red wine vinegar lemon and blue cheese. It was TASTY. I was surprised at how small the oysters were, but the taste compensated for it. [Although there is a larger version of the oyster there. There are many choices] Anyways, I then dug in through my 3 pound lobster, rich and full of meat! I was amazed by how much meat I can get out of it. It was the most satisfying dinner I've had in a while. I greatly recommend this place."}
{"text":"All food was blah - we had salmon and crabcakes - I would not recommend."}
{"text":"GREAT food!!! I'm so impressed! My husband highly recommends the oysters! Definitely order a spicy Bloody Mary, AMAZING!!!!! The service is friendly and attentive.  I can't remember the name of the dish, but it is sort of like a seafood stew.  There is crab, shrimp, fish all in a soup broth inside a big red pot/dish. It comes with bread to dunk in the broth,  Delicious! If you don't like seafood, I highly recommend the chicken breast dinner and the chicken parm.  The chicken is cooked perfectly! You don't even need a knife to cut it.  The food is so packed with flavor! This is probably one of my favorite restaurants now! Will definitely be returning! The food is definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"There wasn't one thing we had that wasn't really good. We started off with the baked mussels - I crave them. They were so flavorful without being too much, too saucy. The bread is complimentary and I love sourdough but even more when served warm with butter. Yum! 

We tried the salmon and the mahi - both dishes were delicious. We all licked our plates clean. 

The service was outstanding - water was kept filled and we never had to hunt down our waitress. We will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"One of the few seafood places where they have a great sushi bar too! Great selection of fish cooked pretty much anyway you want it. Appetizers are good, I recommend the grilled artichoke, it's great!

Parking is a nightmare, but you can usually find a space on the I-215 side of the district and walk a little further. A little on the high side price wise, but overall a nice place to eat."}
{"text":"Do you love both seafood and wine?  Then this is the place for you in Las Vegas, bar none.  They do a great job with their seasonal specials, and the halibut is absolutely amazing.  The best part... bring your own wine from home, as many as you want, for free!  No corkage fee + delicious oysters and fish = happy happy joy joy.  We like to look at the current menu from home, figure out what things we are going to order, then bring some wines specifically paired to what we know we are going to have.  Bringing the wines takes a good meal to a great one and a good date night to an exceptional one.  You can't beat the value and will have a great meal too.  

On great weather days when it is not too hot, make sure to dine on the patio and enjoy the lovely day.  You can people watch everyone walking around The District too if that's your thing."}
{"text":"I will start by saying, this was the WORST meal we have ever had in Las Vegas in any restaurant in a decade. They have napkins with jokes on them as to say, jokes on you for even coming in there.

I ordered a fried chicken sandwhich. There is no way you could even say it was fried ,more like a sad sloppy attempt at a fry job with only 1/4 of the disgusting if you could call it 'batter' sticking and the chicken tasted disgusting. I would not even feed that to my dog. 

My significant other ordered fried catfish, the execution was oily and flavors ruined the flavor of the catfish. The sauteed zuchini was disgutingly oily and mashed potatoes that even can be bested by gerber baby food in a jar.

We also ordered chicken quesidillas for a appetizer....absolutely aweful, portion size was tiny and just terrible in every way. I was actually glad the portion size was so small cause the food was so disgusting. The guacamole served was completely brown. When brought to the attention of the waiter he literally said to our face that you don't order guacamole at a fish restaurant...He also saw that I stopped eating my chicken sandwhich after a few vomit wrenching bites, but didn't care and just made us pay, not even a attempt at helping our obvious disgust about the food. 

I took a picture of my 'fried' chicken sandwhich as proof of the most gross meal served at a restaurant and charged $13 for. I uploaded a picture of their 'fried chicken sandwhich'
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kings-fish-house-henderson-2?select=iJkPIDP3LRTAVAMwtOUgUw#ktw96oP7vKi6A4uJK4M05w

We were so upset at this place and had to leave and go eat somewhere else for dinner. A lot of things have closed down at the District, but I would be so glad so see this place shut down, I would even hold a party outside as they are packing up to leave. 

Kings Fish House - Huge thumbs down! If I could give negative ratings, that still would not be low enough of a rating. Avoid this place so they can go out of business and not serve garbage as food for a premium price."}
{"text":"Omg the worst !! Poor service and the food was poor quality. Have eaten there before and and liked it. Hope things change. We had lunch maybe that was the problem . Worst fish and chips I've ever had"}
{"text":"This place on it's best day is just alright. The service was OK, actually they dropped my friend's food which resulted in a longer wait. We had the oysters and it was OK (oysters are better at The Southpoint). I had the halibut and it was really dry. $26 for a dry fillet of halibut - yikes!!! The sides were good. The portions are really small. I guess the verdict would be so-so food that is a bit over priced."}
{"text":"I ate here for my birthday today... I am Black...the other two women in my party were also... Noone else in the entire restaurant was Black besides us (we noticed toward the end of the meal)... If you have this same condition don't eat here...If you are of any other variety... the food was good..."}
{"text":"sadly, everything must change. they no longer have my favorite salad, the Danish walnut salad. the table cloths are worn and torn. the food plated plainly. Noisy new neighbors ... salad served with the meal ...
a shame, but they are no longer a fave of mine."}
{"text":"The best seafood in Vegas! Off the strip in the Green Valley District..every time we go there we Love our service & food. Fresh fish & tasty salads..not to mention there endless bread .. Never had a bad experience at Kings Fish House. Try the N'Orleans Shrimp in the picture~  Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Deborah was amazing prob more amazing than the food ... great customer service as far as knowing the menu all my questions were answered she was patient and didn't rush us .... 
she came perfect amount of times to check on us but not too many where it gets annoying ...

the trout fillet was a good size nicely marinated and semi blackened pretty yummy 

the only thing I would change. is the cream br√ªl√©e  it must come in a smaller dish 7-8 bites no need for more than that it's a sugar bomb 
the bowel was too big for that amazing international desert ... good things need to come in small packages"}
{"text":"Mo at Kings in Henderson, NV was an excellent waiter.
We hope he will win the earphones that he wants to win.

{"text":"King's Fish House was slightly underwhelming. I love sea food and have eaten at a plethora of sea food joints, but King's is a tad overpriced for the quality of food served. 

My date and I ordered the steak and lobster. The portion size and texture were average, but both lacked in flavor. The sides weren't much better. 

The outdoor seating was a plus. Our waitress was pleasant. I may try King's house again during lunch time, but it isn't worth the price for dinner."}
{"text":"First time here, and what a great experience!  lobster, oysters, king crab, oh my! Mohammed took great care of us! We'll be back"}
{"text":"This place is YUMMY!  The drinks were good, the sushi was tasty and the lobster and sides were all sooooooooo great. We shared dessert too (there is always room for dessert). I left this restaurant SO full but satisfied!  I can't wait til I am back in the area and can eat here again."}
{"text":"Hit KFH tonite w. sister and her two daughters.  Busy, but no wait.  Sits within the District, has a nice patio area, perfect weather to sit outside so we do.

I've eaten at several of the KFH's in so cal and i feel it's the best casual seafood place around.  Most of the fish prices ( comes with 2 side dishes - about 12 different sides to choose from )  are in the $15-$25 range.  Of course, if you hit them for king crab legs or lobster you are gonna pay !

The KFH is on par with my past experiences at the other location,   we started with some sashimi.  i gotta admit, i feel that they shouldn't have sushi at KFH but given my diet, it's a perfect starter. sashimi - yellowtail and salmon.  both were decent, not stellar but hit the spot.  

I had the charbroiled ono, spinach and cole slaw - all good ! Sis had the ahi tuna - seared, red potatoes and veggies.  The kids had salmon and shark ( i was surprised they went with the non-kids menu items ) They loved it.

total bill ( no dessert, also a soup and salad for the group, sodas )

$125.  If you are in the mood for seafood, moderate budget, King's is the place."}
{"text":"Wanted so badly to love King's but our meal was horrendous. Grilled artichoke app and salads (one field greens, one caesar) were ok, nothing special. The sourdough everyone raves about was wet-centered and doughy. Worst of all, the seared ahi was so riddled with muscle and sinew that I could not even eat it. Dunked two small bites into the bland ponzu sauce and that was the end of it. We boxed it up to bring home to our dog, but not sure even he will want it? It was that bad. I have never had ahi striped through and through with muscle and sinew, just unpalatable all the way around. Husby had the cioppino, did not care for the seafood nor the broth; too bland and watery. Sorry King's but you need to up your ahi game or take it off the menu. Rotten Mother's Day meal ugh.

++++++++++++++++++++++++

Edited 10 days following initial visit and one star rating post:

Heard from GM Rodney yesterday, who apologized for our poor dining experience and agreed, that cut of ahi never should've made it to our table filleted. Normally, he explained, the muscly cuts are dissected in prep kitchen and the muscle removed, leaving the tender bits to be served as pok√®.  Rodney offered out a gift certificate so we can try King's again, this was kind, gracious and very much appreciated! Will have another go then and pray for a fab meal. Thank you King's Fish House for listening and responding to our concerns....have added two stars to my original review and will re evaluate 3 stars on our next visit;)"}
{"text":"Sometimes when a dining experience falls short of your expectations its poor ordering on your part, failing to ask enough questions. For what ever the reason great recovery effort by a skilled caring staff can save the evening.  I arrived committed to ordering oysters. I went against my hunger. What I got was good, so it's my own darned fault for not being delighted with the Captains Platter (fried) yep I shoulda known better!  I must admit that the sushi as an appetizer was excellent as was the side of grilled zucchini! Even more satisfying was the Bread Pudding with whisky sauce! I moved here from Kentucky and this girl loves her whisky sauce!!! An unsavory oversight from dishwashing process nearly had me bailing out before dinner arrived. The managers bosses were milling around and I would hope they would be proud of how the caring staff restored my dining equilibrium. Nicely handled. Had they fallen short of only have given one star!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and satisfying.  Paradise oysters were very fresh tasting. The hostess and servers were very pleasant and friendly."}
{"text":"I was very underwhelmed by this place. 

Pros: location is convenient and close to other bars, restaurants, shops... The District is very cute

Cons: inattentive hostess and waitresses, neither were particularly friendly. Also, the food was so-so. I had the fried softshell crab and my date had the seared ahi tuna that was very dry and tough. 

Overall, it wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Kings Fish House is a wonderful change of pace from all the buger, pizza and steak houses. First, let me say, I always sit on the casual side, same restaurant, two doors, one casual, one more of a formal ambience. I have been going to Kings since they've opened, and I can say their policy of \" If you don't like it, we will happily replace it\" is tested, tried and true. Their fish is always fresh, a wide variety offered daily, they print new menus for each and everyday.  They offer a wide variety of cooking options for each fresh fish. The fresh oysters on the half shell also change daily, I have never been disappointed with the recommendation of the always friendly, polite, cheerful service staff. I think I have had just about everything on the menu, there is something for everyone on the menu, they offer a land lovers section.
I have never been disappointed, treated badly or had anything even remotely close to a bad experience. I do suggest you try, not far from the strip, about 15 minutes, wonderful surroundings and a nice place to unwind! Some may think they are pricey, but for the quality of the fish, and all food really I believe it is priced quite right."}
{"text":"Damn good fish and sides.  Enjoyed the patio and the beer as well. Will plan to come back again. Looks like the apps are good too."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot particularly if you like to dine outside.  They have both a covered area and uncovered area.  We sat on the bar side of the restaurant which is the uncovered, seat yourself area.  It was just starting to warm up and I wanted to sit out in the sun.  They have a few umbrella's if you like a little shade as well.
We started with a sushi roll, spicy tuna, that was good.  Not as good as a sushi only place, but still very tasty.  My husband had the fish and chips which was very good.  Not too greasy and very good tartar sauce.  Tartar sauce is really the reason I order fish and chips and theirs was excellent, just regular old fashioned tartar sauce, not trying to be 'aioli' which seems to be the norm anymore.   I had the grilled fish sandwich.  You choose from many toppings, and can have as many as you like.  I was a minimalist and just had red leaf lettuce, raw red onion and of course... tartar sauce.  It was excellent.  I only meant to eat half but the whole thing was gone before I realized it.  The fries were good but the coleslaw was nothing special.  Overall the whole meal was very enjoyable. 
Our server was excellent as well.  We were drinking one ice tea and one soda, which she kept full at all times.  She even offered to put them into to-go cups when we were ready to leave.  Very customer focused, which we appreciated."}
{"text":"Located at the \"District\", an outdoor shopping/restaurant area right next to the Green Valley Ranch Resort.

We started with an oyster sampler (6pcs), blue point, kumamoto, wellfleets and 3 others that I can't recall - all fresh and properly cleaned.  I ordered a shrimp po boy - delicious.  Wife had a shrimp louie salad with crab and of course shrimp(not bay shrimp) -  very fresh, nice portion.  Washed down with a glass of wine & a beer.

A nice selection on seafood, we'll definitely return.  They print out their menus daily."}
{"text":"On a VERY cold winter night, we decided we wanted seafood. Kings Fish House came up in the search and was well regarded by Yelpers, so we went. No wait, but we got seated outside...With the heaters and the patio cover it was okay, but I still kept my coat on until we'd gotten enough food and drink to warm up. 

Ambiance is nothing to write home about, especially on a winter patio, but I'll be it's really nice during the warmer weather. Nice selection of oysters, too bad we're not oyster people. Drink service was fast. Asked the server for recommendations, and all she did was point at the most expensive items in the center section. Food took a bit to arrive, which was surprising, given how empty it was. Once the food arrived, service was good until we wanted to leave, then we had trouble flagging her down to get our check. (In all fairness, this happens everywhere.) 

Priced high for what we got, but Green Valley seems to be tourist prices, so there ya go. Parking is weird, but this Green Valley, so there ya go. 
Would easily put this in the rotation for out of towners, but not sure I'd make a point of going here for myself."}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice place for dinner with fish or vegetarian options and decided on Kings Fish House, which neither of us had been before. We love the District and with no reservation we thought if there is a long wait we'd have other options. 

Did you know that you can seat yourself in the bar/sushi section!? There was no wait there! They have the same menu and although it's less formal, we loved the fun and festive decor and casual atmosphere. The bar itself is nice, Perry was happy to have several craft beers to choose from. 

The service was great! Scarlett, our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the fish and menu items. Water and a sourdough loaf was brought quickly, we ordered the grilled artichoke to start, Perry wanted a Caesar salad and I wanted fish - I ordered the fresh caught Mahi Mahi with rice and saut√©ed spinach. The artichoke was AMAZING! It was cooked to perfection, the sauce was tangy and fresh. Perry's salad was the perfect size (for a small plate, it was a huge portion) and the Mahi Mahi was juicy and delicious! It's hard to get Mahi right, and Kings did it just right!"}
{"text":"What are you people talking about? The food was bland at best. While I could suffer the food, the manager was a total jerk. Rude, snooty and pretencious. When I wanted to comment on the food (I was happy to pay the check and leave) this night manager jerk was total \"a\" wipe! I will never go back and I will tell 10 others because of the experience with the Friday night male manager ape."}
{"text":"We love this place.  The food and service are incredible and the portions are well worth the money.  Besides, the have Orion beer from Okinawa; that gives them 10 points off the top to start.  The only down side is that it's located in The District and I live in Sunrise, so it's a half-hour drive to get there.  If I lived closer, I'd be eating there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Discovered a varietal during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa (at the Wine Market across from Great Lakes Brewery on Market Street in Cleveland): Cederberg Bukketraube (S.Africa). The barista was so good at its selling points I couldn't resist taking a bottle home. Definitely one of my new favorite whites, and well worth the price, which isn't unreasonable/too steep at less than $40.    

Anyway, back to King's: I almost always order any of the following when I'm in town --

APP: Ceviche, Ahi poke, Fish tacos (Rubios fresh Mex grill in SoCal's are better though), Wild Newfoundland Bay shrimp cocktail and any of the following oyster varieties: Malpeque (Prince Edward Island), Malaspina (British Columbia), Chef's Creek or Fanny Bay (Vancouver Island BC) or Miyagi (South Puget Sound).

BEER: My personal favorite, on tap: Fat Tire out of Fort Collins, CO. They also have Newcastle, BayHawk Hefeweizen (Irvine) and King Crab Honey Ale (Bayhawk,Irvine).
 

ENTREE: Macadamia Nut-Crusted Halibut w/orange ginger butter sauce (usually with vegetable side of the day and jasmine rice, linguini or ratatouille), Coconut Crusted Wild Ecuadorian Mahi Mahi w/rum butter sauce and their Yellowfin Ahi tuna w/sides are all incredible. 

Dessert: Cr√®me Brul√©e or Bread Pudding. Their sorbet's really good, too."}
{"text":"My family loves this place. seriously LOVES it. we eat here all the time, it is a bit pricey but well worth it. My father and I love the king crab legs, literally the best ones in town. I have this little happy dance I do while eating them because theyre so stinkin good I cant contain my excitement. We always order sushi before hand and creme brulee afterwards and everything is always better than I remember. My boyfriend however isnt a fan of seafood (i know why go to a fish house) and everything he has ordered has just been mediocre. I think if theres anything they would have to work on it would be that. But overall my favorite place. oh and get the creme brulee, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time trying King's Fish House for lunch and had high expectations going in. Unfortunately, it didnt quite live up to what we were hoping for.

I had Angel hair pasta with shrimp with a cup of New England clam chowder soup, my mom ordered the grilled catfish, and my sister got the seabass. They also had sides of fries,  spinach, and corn (see pictures). We were also served some bread at beginning of our meal.

None of these dishes quite stood out. Clam chowder was yummy and not overly salty - just how I like it. My pasta dish and my mom's catfish were just A-Ok.. but the seabass was the biggest let down.  Lacked flavor and had a very tough texture.

Staff was friendly and the seating area outside was nice (we lucked out that day with warm weather).  But im not sure if I'll make another visit."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Started with a plate of oysters.  Selection was great, multiple kinds with varying degrees of sizes.  Waiter was knowledgeable on the differences between the oysters.  Main meal was the clam bake which was phenomenal."}
{"text":"I was with a group of coworkers at GVR and we walked around and decided to try this place out, it was my second time but a first for everyone else and it turned out to be a well received choice.  

I have to start off by saying this place has amazing bread that was fresh and the service was always at the ready to refill drinks and the break basket, both of which are big points for me.  I decided to be adventurous and instead of the halibut as usual I want for the soft shell crap picatta and it was quite delicious with generous portions.  Usually I only focus on the entree but this time I really need to put in a strong suggestion for the spinach and sweet carrots, both well exceeded expectations and as with everything else seemed to be quite fresh.  

I recommend this place for business meals or a date as it's well suited for either and it's a great place to take advantage of cool and comfortable evening weather for dining alfresco."}
{"text":"Five stars to Kings for their generosity.

My kid ran out of milk while we were cruising through The District At Green Valley Ranch so I stopped in to ask if I could buy a cup of whole milk.  They provided it at no charge and were very friendly about it.  Thanks again!"}
{"text":"went to kings on saturday for an early meal, while out doing the day after xmas shopping!  i have been here a few times for my seafood fix, and time after time the service is very slow, and this visit is the same (at least they are consistent!!)
started the table with the chilled seafood platter for 24.95  comes with 4 dungeness crab legs, 4 oysters, 4 clams and 8 shrimps.  and i think this one of the best deals in vegas for a shellfish platter.
entrees were grilled shrimp and scallop skewars, kids burger and a combo fried platter.   the fried platter was not to good,  over breaded and gummy shrimp and scallops, and 1 little peice of cod/haddock
i usually get the sanddabs or something that is on special,  ill stick with that in the future.  but in all actuallity i just come for the shellfsih platter!!!"}
{"text":"We've dined at King's a few times and overall, we definitely like it.

We've now tried everything from their jumbo crab cocktail to their clam chowder to their filet mignon. They have a very vast menu, which includes fresh fish, oysters, shrimp, and sushi. Their menu is one where everyone in your party will find something appealing. 

Their prices are decent, but definitely worth the freshness. Their service has always been outstanding, from the host who seated us, to every server we've had. They've been knowledgeable about their food, prompt, and attentive.

When you're at the District and craving seafood or even a great steak, we'd highly recommend King's Fish House. We are fans of Presidio and Lucille's, also, but King's definitely trumps all their seafood. Hands down."}
{"text":"I just left lunch at Kings Fish House and it was AMAZING. Everything was perfect. 

We ordered lots! Started with the crab cakes and they were so delicious and full of fish. I got the clam chowder to start before my meal and I am from the East Coast and know my chowder well and this one is right up there. 

For my meal I got the scallops and shrimp blackened with garlic mashed potatoes and the grilled zucchini which was SO good! They change the menu twice a day so you know the fish is beyond fresh and when they run out, that's it. There is no freezer to run to and defrost more which is a great addition. 

Our service was spectacular. Our server Karyne was friendly, attentive and made sure we liked everything we were given including the iced tea. 

All and all from beginning to end this was wonderful and I cannot wait to bring my friends here!"}
{"text":"Service Fantastic...  Food was eh.   Here's my breakdown:

I had visited this location twice.  You are brought out their sourdough bread to begin with.   Hot and delicious!  The first time I had ordered the New England Clam Chowder and Macadamia Nut Crusted Salmon.   I really loved the idea of the fish but the flavor just didn't coincide with what I imagined.  It lacked any flavor...  just bland.  Bummer.  The soup was great.   Very creamy and filling.

So on the second visit I wanted to get the soup again to see if it was consistent with my previous visit.   Yep!  Great and flavorful!  Since I was disappointed with the fish the first time, I went with their Seafood Cobb Salad.  My husband actually ordered a different type of salmon on the menu.   Again, his fish was a disappointment.  Lacked any flavor.  Even his rosemary potatoes were sad.  They were over salted and not even cooked through.   My salad was just ok.  The shrimp were very sad little pieces.  The scallops didn't even appease me.  At least the soup and bread were still good.  It's probably not enough to keep me coming back here though.  

They do have a sushi bar connected and I didn't try this yet.  There may be a possibility of trying it but the entrees have been such a let down that I doubt it.  

The three stars were given only because of the fantastic service they deliver here.   On both occasions, the waiters were so attentive and friendly.   They deserve all of the praise!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, enormous portions, and an uninspiring wine list make Kings Fish House the epitome of a boring chain restaurant's suburban location. They have the \"Hello, my name is Jane and I will be your server tonight!\" kind of robotic service, which I find terribly annoying. 

I'd be willing to overlook all the above if the oysters - something they are supposed to be known for - had been great. Unfortunately, they were neither particularly fresh, nor were they shucked immaculately. Heck, the selection itself was a disappointment with three out of seven being from the same Mexican bay and only two East Coast options. And such disappointment was every dish we had from salads to main courses through \"specials\", including the salmon that was colored to a hideous cadmium orange shade you would only expect to find on a Pantone color guide and not on your plate.

Luckily, there are plenty more fish in the sea, so it's very unlikely I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"Fresh seafood with beautiful decor! 

I came here with my mom on a late evening and the weather was perfect to sit outside so we got to enjoy the beautiful patio seating. This place is gorgeous inside out. Fresh flowers adorn every corner.

We ordered a few cocktails, a mai tai & key lime martini. Both were strong and big; good combos! We then had some calamari that was outstanding with two different dipping sauces; a creamy tartarish one and a sweet & sour one that was a really nice surprise. We also ordered poke and it was so fresh and a tad on the spicy side which was great with some seaweed salad on the side. Lastly came traditional creme br√ªl√©e. 

The meal was great and so was the service. The menu itself is big and we had a hard time choosing what to get because we weren't that hungry. I'm already thinking of going back on a nice evening again to try things that had my interest. They have an extensive sushi menu and are of course known for their seafood with so many fresh fish options. Broiled halibut may have to come next..."}
{"text":"Soon as we were seated, I saw our server's name tag and I said, \"seen some good stuff about you on Yelp\" (and TripAdvisor)!  Knew then that our group would be well taken care of by Karyne--and we were!  Our Meet Up group of 8 had a nice time eating, meeting and catching up, although it can be a little difficult to hear with the din in the dining room.  (For good communication and in hindsight, maybe it would have been better to have a group like ours dine at the high pub tables in the sushi bar/lounge area instead.)  Seemed like the group in general enjoyed their meals--my friends loved the grilled artichokes, fresh oysters, mahimahi, halibut and the rest--and I liked my order of hazelnut encrusted wild salmon with lemon butter sauce, along with the saut√©ed spinach and the grilled zucchini sides.  Karyne did a great job taking care of our tableful of folk, including splitting out our checks (without us asking)!  Haven't been to King's in a long time, but I know I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"Great food, wait stand isn't always the best :/"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Kings many times in the past, both in Henderson and in Calabasas. I keep on coming back because they've been consistently good. When we went to Kings this time we were not particularly hungry. My wife and I decided to share the wedge salad as an appetizer and then share the Mexican shrimp as a main course. The wedge salad was absolutely excellent. The iceberg lettuce was cold and crisp and fresh. There was an ample amount of crushed bacon. It came with a fresh tomato slice on the side. I don't know how they get such delicious tomatoes, but it was a perfect accompaniment to this salad. It was covered, but not drowned, in a delicious bleu  cheese dressing. Unfortunately, the Mexican shrimp did not live up to its usual standards. We have ordered this dish many times in the past. It always had large delicious shrimp that were cooked to perfection. This time, the shrimp were very modest in size although they were still tasty. Eating on the patio at Kings is always a delight because it is far away from the parking lot and the people watching is excellent."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come to this place for some time now as I am a huge seafood lover but unfortunately my daughter has a severe allergy to fish so I put off trying it. I finally decided to call last week to see if there were any options for my daughter and spoke with the chef there. I explained how severe the allergy was and that nothing she eats can ever come in contact with fish or be prepared in the same area. He was very accommodating and told us he would cook her meal in a completely separate pan and personally ensure that it does not touch any of the common food areas in the kitchen. He told us his name and we asked for him the next night. He was happy to help us and the food was delicious! My daughter was able to eat safely and I satisfied my seafood craving. I am very pleased with my experience and their willingness to go above and beyond. I will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"Great swordfish. Wonderful Sour Dough French Bread. Be sure to try their Artichoke appetizer.  It is grilled and served with a pesto sauce.  I found the fried catfish to be a bit salty though."}
{"text":"Definitely got food poisoning from this place! I had the basil-pesto shrimp, recommended by our waiter. I actually questioned the flavor of the meal a bit- but after a busy day, I was starving and it was the ONLY thing I'd eaten that day. I chalked it up to just being something I'd never had before. I was violently ill (I'll spare you the details) from 2am that morning until about 7pm that night. Couldn't so much as even take a sip of water. Since I couldn't exactly make a phone call the next day from being so sick- my husband sent an email to the manager. No response. Great business ethics! Not! Even if you DON'T think I could have possibly gotten sick from your food don't you call to ask some clarifying questions to be sure?"}
{"text":"Yes, its a chain however this place is truly a chain done well. It is one of my go to places for either a quick bite/lunch/full dinner. This place has not let me down. Its really nice to have consistency in food quality sometimes.  I guess over the years I have probably eaten 30+ times. It's always a good choice if you are a seafood lover. Is it the best seafood you can get, no but it truly is good-time and again."}
{"text":"I really despise chain restaurants, and when you add seafood to that equation, you can normally forget it, but I can honestly say my experiences at Kings Fish House have been nice. Wish I could give it 3.5 stars.
The staff is well educated on the items on their menu, their descriptions are accurate, and their suggestions are good.
I have always loved all the oysters I have had here, they are all fresh, chilled perfectly, and shucked well. 
Some items are have that gross mass-produced taste (most of their sides), and some of their appetisers are just gross, but if you stick to basic fresh seafood and don't smother it in a cloying mess, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The best buffalo chicken wings in town! Who could have imagined that a fish place would have amazing wings. They bake them first and then flash fry them. You gotta try them :-)"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night for our 5 year anniversary. I had been wanting to try this place for a long time, but we never had the right timing or a big enough wallet, so we decided it was a special enough occasion to go for it before a night at the movies. 

We were seated very promptly, waited 5 minutes for a drink order to be taken, another 5 minutes for it to arrive. Our original server was very nice, thorough and warm. When we were ready to place our order, we were introduced to our new server (by our old server) as it was shift change. Our new server was also very nice, and very prompt with service. 

Hubby ordered the fish and chips, which he says was good. I ordered the whole Dungeness Crab. I am not used to eating innards and was honestly a little turned off to the meal by it, I think this should be more of an option than a standard, but that might just be me. I'm just not that into eating crab guts and had a hard time cleaning it off during my meal. Not appealing. 

Overall, it was a good meal with great service. I just honestly have a hard time paying $30 for a whole crab that kind of grossed me out when I could go to the store and buy one for about $10 and eat at home. 

It's a good place to eat, don't get me wrong, I just wouldn't order the crab again and would have to find something else to get."}
{"text":"Kings Fish House is a restaurant that I come to quite frequently. I'm not sure if it's commonly known but this particular Kings location serves sushi in addition to seafood. And I am a self proclaimed Sushi Superfan! I come here specifically for the Tuna Poke salad. It's the best I've ever had. Something about it... They make theirs with macadamia nuts, cucumbers, avocado, seaweed and sprouts. It's really spicy and flavorful and like nothing I've ever had before. I'm a Tuna Poke connoisseur and I've traveled all over sampling various Tuna Poke salads. I've even tried to get other places to recreate the one I've experienced at Kings Fish House to no avail. So therefore, I recommend trying it because it is special, but don't blame me if you get hooked too! You've been warned! I've contemplated bribing the chef for the recipe many times and you might not want to be in that boat, plotting and planning like I do. I've actually been putting off writing this review because I knew I'd start thinking about it and have to go satisfy my urge AGAIN. I just can't get enough! I crave it on a regular basis. And sure enough, I was right about my reviewing Kings and thoughts of Poke overtaking my brain. Yep, I'm wanting it in a bad way now. Doh!!!!

Speaking of DOH!!... The other thing I love that is worth mentioning is their Sourdough bread. Amazing, warm, fluffy and yummilicious! Their Oysters, Miso soup & Key Lime pie are all worth a try too.

Service is usually quick. Since I've been so many times, a few of the servers remember what I want so I don't even have to order, which is always nice and makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"We had an incredible time! We went for my birthday dinner on my 47th! I had the 2 lb Maine Lobster, my daughter had the California Rolls, Ceviche' with fresh citrus (spicy!) and the Garlic Mashed Potatoes. Hubby had the King's Combo Platter. We had the Chocolate Hand Dipped Ice Cream and the New York Cheesecake for dessert. 

Truly, everything was superb! Absolutely delicious. We all enjoyed everything immensley.

Our server was Gaffnir. He was very attentive, friendly, extremely solid product knowledge and GREAT with suggestions for us first timers. We appreciated his efforts a lot. 

We will ABSOLUTELY eat there again. A+!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but Mo was awesome. We need more Mo. I'm glad the prices came down and the fish was cooked perfectly this time so I'm hoping it's a revival for this place.  Changed my review. Food is just average or below. Some things seemed frozen, like the crab cakes. Not going back anytime soon. 7/15/15."}
{"text":"Only one other couple in here with us on the sushi side and still terrible service. Bartender was too busy texting on her phone, waitress could care less about checking on us and my cocktail was 95% ice. The \"spicy\" crab roll was just the same filling as the California roll. 

I would definitely pass."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with one of my friends when we were exploring the area. Our server told us that their menu changes daily. I was surprised to see that an american-style seafood place also serves sushi, but I guess it makes sense, since it's all fish.

I had grilled salmon with grilled zucchini and rosemary potatoes and a small cup of their white bean and smoked salmon soup. The soup was really good. It tasted like a southwestern style soup with a little kick. The salmon was delicious as well as the zucchini. The zucchini was so juicy and it had a nice crunch to it. The potatoes weren't anything special.

The service was good. I think their plate presentation could be improved though. Their complimentary bread was also very delicious. Hot and fresh each time."}
{"text":"Great service!  Awesome seafood..also you can order susi from the restaurant  nextdoor. If you live in Henderson you got to give this place a try...fun spot to start the night at the District. Good for the family. Kids are always welcome and abundant here. 

The have seasonal specials...so good to come in few time a year. Have not had a bad meal here yet! Little bit pricy for the food..but service is so good...worth paying a little extra..

You will be too full for dessert. ..so you have to get desserts to go!! Key lime pie is fantastic!"}
{"text":"King's is a great place to bring the kids. Great food for Seafood lovers and other tastes. Asked your server to show your children a Live Lobster. Very Cool!"}
{"text":"I must first start off and admit that I worked here years ago, so I may be a little biased. I have seen the kitchen though and can tell you it is the CLEANEST restaurant I had EVER worked at in my life. I can also tell you it's a great company that really cares about food and treats their employees very well. 

Having had everything on the menu, literally, I can tell you there just isn't anything I don't like. The fish is fresh, the sauces are tasty, and the plates are large. I haven't had the sushi in a long time and should probably try it again since I'm MUCH more educated about it now a days. I could easily believe it's still just as good as I remember. They also have a great oyster selection with 9 on hand almost always. I really got to learn oysters when I worked here as they would let us have one whenever we wanted so if a new selection came in I would try a it out. Thanks to them I fell in love with Kumomotos but I digress.

The staff is always extremely knowledgable and I can tell you they train WELL. I've never had anyone who was pretty good. I did have a bartender a  month or so back that was fairly disappointing or at least preoccupied, which I'm not sure I would have noticed had he not all the sudden became more attentive when he realized I knew the upper management. Funny how that lights a fire under someone. Sad though since he should have always been so attentive, but I'll cut him some slack since I don't need my hand held. 

All in all King's is one of my favorite places in this area. I definitely love to stop in for a little wine and fish. I had always wished they'd had opened one in Denver while I was there but I'm back and can go whenever I want. Heck, I might go get some fish tonight!"}
{"text":"We had been very regular customers of Kings but it had been awhile since we had visited.  It was a Monday night and the place was almost empty.  I guess Monday are probably slow but not that slow.
After receiving sub par food and service I figured out why so slow.
My guess is they'll probably close before too long at this rate"}
{"text":"Located in The District, an outdoor shopping area located in the shadow of Green Valley Ranch, Kings Fish House stands head and shoulders above the nearby competitors. Thee menu here is well thought out, and the seafood distribution process must be flawless.  

Growing up on the Chesapeake Bay, I developed a taste for fresh, raw oysters.  I was extremely skeptical when I saw some of the Virginia and Maryland varieties that I love on the menu at Kings.  When they arrived at the table they appeared amazingly fresh and tasted even better.  I also love Copper River Sockeye Salmon season and the blackened filet that the kitchen prepared for me today was out of this world.

They have a cool menu for the kids and my daughter loves her plastic cum with mermaids on it.  My wife really enjoyed the creme brulee that was served for dessert.  

All in all a fabulous experience.  The patio is super inviting and I cannot wait for the cooler weather to return to take full advantage of this little gem!!"}
{"text":"King's is pretty good, they have great tuna poke, and the crab legs are good, but pricey!!

The one thing they do have that is AMAZING is the Key Lime Pie, if you like Key Lime that is... they make it fresh daily on premises.. so my review is largely to let you know if you eat there save room for the dessert, mainly the Key Lime Pie!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is interesting.  The sourdough is the BEST in town.  I like the food here. The chowder was pretty dang good.  Not too many potatoes, which is lame (when some places put them in).  I LIKE this chowder!  I got the--hell, I don't remember, but it was good.  The bottom one of the fish selections.  Like $23.95 or so.  Damn tasty, kind of an Asian-Cajun thing going on there.  Creative.  They lose two stars because the tables are the size of a quarter and the server we had was a dolt.  He clearly did not want to be there.  Maybe it was because they made him work outside in the tent where we were sitting.  I dunno.  If you don't like your job, quit.  Don't be an ass.  I would go back, if that dude weren't my server."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of going to the grand opening for Kings Fish House and still love it to this day! Great food and service! One of my favorite places to eat at, especially for their amazing seafood. I will be going there soon. :)"}
{"text":"I had come in after a day of hiking with some friends and while we were waiting to be seated, the host had made a rude and unnecessary comment about my t-shirt. This made me feel very uncomfortable. We decided to leave after waiting for a long time as well to get any type of service. Very rude employees that clearly don't know the first thing about customer service."}
{"text":"It has slowly but surely gone downhill. Friday night and it's empty so I think other people are thinking the same thing. They messed up every dish we ordered."}
{"text":"My sister took me to lunch today after my birthday spa day. I had a craving for crab so hey the crab Loui at kings is will usually enough to cure that craving. Not today.
Usually there is nice pieces of lump crab meat not little shreds but more then that not smelly nobody likes smelly crab meat in a salad. Yuck. My Sis order some ahi tuna salad the presentation looked like nothing you'd want to eat. I guess it tasted worse then it looked she sent it back. I was on the phone she ended up getting a crab Loui before I could tell her Noooo. But the absolute worst was the grilled artichoke I love them have had them here before. This was one that should have hit the trash last night. Drowning in dressing Because it was clearly old and not fresh and not even hot. We ate it anyway because we were so hungry. Not pleased. Service was ok probrably because we were one of only three tables. My husband likes the fish and chips here but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really didn't want to give this place any stars.

This was our 2nd time coming to his restaurant. The first time we came was with my gfs family and I believe it was Mothers Day as well. There was about 15 of us and they seated us in a timely manner and the service was great. 

So on a random night I was craving for some oysters and thought of Kings Fish House and it is really close to our house. Plus I like walking around at The District at night to see all the pretty lights. We enter to 2 snotty hostesses who seemed like they didnt even want to seat us. It was like an awkward greeting/sitting. Idk who the hostess was but she needs a better attitude. 

We came on a Thursday night and it was like the perfect night to eat outside. We were seated outside and our waitress took literally like 20 mins to come and greet us and ask for our drinks. I ordered a corona and babe ordered a blue moon. We didn't waste any time and ordered our food right away as well. I ordered a half dozen of fresh oysters, a lobster bisque, the fried catfish and fries and babe just ordered like 2 rolls of sushi. Got our drinks like 10 minutes later, she comes to the table and asks if we want cups for our beer and we said 'yes please' and that took another 10 minutes. When she came back with the cups she asked if we wanted some bread while we wait..and the funny thing is ..is thay she never came back with bread nor mention it at all after. Dont offer bread and we say yes please and then she never brings it ever. I didnt even waste my time asking for bread again because that would've took another 15 minutes. Finally after what feels like 45 mins we get our food. I mean how long is it supposed to take for fried catfish and 2 rolls of sushi. I would imagine not that long since I didn't order any meat just fish. We did get our oysters in a  good amount of time I couldn't complain. The lobster bisque or should I call it the lobster cream broth? NO chunks of lobster what so ever the broth was too salty and not pleasant to enjoy. OMG so I take a bite of the fried catfish and it was sooo bland I really wanted to just give back my whole plate. I was soo upset. I mean it had a good crunchy coating of break crumbs but there was no flavor what so ever. The fries were better than the fish. Babes rolls were 'ok'. They used imitation crab and I was really upset about that. I really don't like fake fish especially when eating sushi. 

She never once came back to see how our food was. The service was horrible and I was soo upset. And my bill was like $80.00. Not a good and happy way to spend that much money on food that I didn't even enjoy and the poor service that they had. I will not recommend this place at all. Big waste of money."}
{"text":"I came in with a date, for a quick bite and drink before we headed out for our \"real\" dinner at a \"fancier\" place. We canceled our reservation at the other place and stayed put. The serves was great, timely check in's and the server was well versed with the menu. My fish was cooked perfect moist and delicious. Drinks were well priced and yummy. The food menu was interesting and I will totally be back. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner with my significant other. Ordered the fish tacos, lobster, and ahi tuna poke. Everything came out promptly and was very delicious. Our waitress was extremely helpful and friendly. For a Friday night, it was very quiet, which was pleasant. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"I created a log in only to leave this review because I was so let down by this place. I am only giving one star because I like the out side dining. long story short...... from the beginning the hostesses acted like we where inconvenience by coming in to the restaurant. we had three adults and two kids and asked to sit outside. The young hostesses acted put out then grabbed one kids menu and our adult menus and walked off so we fallowed, no please fallow me or right this way,  just walked us out tossed our menus on the table and walked off. sticking the high chair at the end of the table by the swing door that the servers fly in and out of. let me tell you how nice that made dining. Then we did finally get a waiter and asked for crayons for the kids that the hostess forgot, The waiter was nice seemed a bit lost but nice, we ordered and there started the long wait finally getting our food thinking it would be hot because the plates were but the food was luke warm and all our food had not flavor. The fish was bland and my sister got the fried cat fish and it was soaked in grease, my king platter was horrible I couldn't even eat it, the sides where cold and again no flavor! So long story short price was way to high for food that tasted like it came from a frozen dinner. i am typing this on my phone because i do not want somebody else to waist there money before i get a chance to get on my computer. Will never return"}
{"text":"New in town and stumbled upon this place on our way to another restaurant and could not resist. Luckily it was a great decision on both parts. They have an extensive dinner menu so deciding on the food was a challenging. I ended up getting the lobster bisque which was one of the better bisque I have had in a while as it had a sweet after taste. Then ordered some sushi which was both fresh and refreshing. For my entree I ordered the linguine and clam sauce and my friend the soft shell crab tempura which was awesome. They gained a new fan and I will be back and make this part of my regular rotation as well when I have friends into town."}
{"text":"I'm no longer a youth, I go to Henderson for a quiet dinner on a Saturday night.  Ahi Poke Salad is a winner, it was super spicy though, but then again I'm getting old so maybe I just can't handle a little beat of heat.  That is the appetizer to get.

California Sea Bass was ordered as the main entree.  It was a little tough from being overcooked, but I still thought it was good.  I bet it would be amazing if done right though.  That was prepared with lemon butter.

Surprisingly their house salad dressing was really really good, need to know what they put in that."}
{"text":"Very mediocre. 

So, this place was recommended as a super great place for seafood. I'd honestly rather eat at Red Lobster (not hatin, just sayin) than this place. You really cant go wrong with cheddar bay biscuits. 

Decor is mundane seafood-y shenanigans. Service was nice and standard, no complaints there.

Ok so, i went with 5 other people. So i'll do a run down of some of the food items we ordered. 

Appetizers: 
- I got the mussels. I am ALL about mussels. These were terrible. Zero flavor, the broth was like, butter water. No bueno. You get a pretty decent amount but this is the first time i actually was bothered that there were so many mussels because they did not taste good and i had to eat ALL of them because nobody else would help me eat them because of their lack of any kind of flavor whatsoever. 
- Crab cakes seemed decent, nothing to write home about, calamari was standard. Nothing special. 

Food:
- I got the mexican shrimp and scallops. I was expecting spicy. These had very little flavor and the scallops were small. They come skewered with zucchini which i did not know, and i ended up getting zucchini as my side. it would have been nice if the server informed me of this. so. with the combination of no flavor and an excess amount of zucchini, i was disappointed. 
- My boyfriend got the salmon salad, he said it was interesting because of the ingredients in the salad but the salmon itself did not taste all that great. 
- Other food highlights from the rest of the group, swordfish was ok, not the best. the tempura soft shell crab was mostly batter. the macadamia  crusted halibut was very good, and another person ordered crab cakes as their main meal and had no complaints. 

just another bland seafood experience."}
{"text":"TIP: Kumamoto oysters! And the New England clam chowder (one of the best I've had)!

REVIEW: Although it's not my favorite place to dine for seafood, I have always been a fan of Kings Fish House.  I love that it's located at the District, which has been remodeled and decorated for the holidays--festive!  We came in Sunday night for dinner.  It was not busy at all, and we were immediately sat at a booth.  It took a little while for the server to come by and greet us.  By the time he came by, my boyfriend and I had thoroughly looked through the menu and were ready to order.

Anyway, we ordered, and our server brought us some sourdough bread and butter.  The sourdough bread was fresh and warm--crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  For starters, we had a dozen of the Kumamuto oysters, which were not bad.  Served alongside horseradish, mignonette, cocktail sauce and lemon wedges, the oysters were small yet plump, sweet, and creamy--as they were supposed to be.  There WERE a couple in the bunch, however, that were a little on the fishy side... it wasn't enough to ruin the meal though.  I had also ordered the New England clam chowder--so good!  It wasn't thick or lumpy how most chains serve clam chowder; it was perfectly soupy, creamy, and clammy! lol My boyfriend's not regularly a fan of clam chowder, and even he liked it.  For our entree, we had the crab leg dinner special (I forget what kind they were), which came with a pound of crab and two sides.  For sides, I had the vegetable ratatouille and macaroni and cheese, and he had the saut√©ed spinach and cheese grits.  The crab legs were good.  They were thick and had some nice sweet, juicy chunks of meat; I was only sad that there wasn't more!  The shell itself was spiky and a little rough to get through, but worth the work if you really like crab.  The sides were good, but nothing to rave about.  The meal came out to about $140, without tip.  Our server was great though, despite the fact that he was little busy in the beginning.

Overall, Kings Fish House isn't bad.  They've got great reasonably priced seafood.  Plus I hear they have a pretty good happy hour.  Gotta give that a shot next time!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service!
We come here often. This past week, weather was great for dining on the patio. 
Ordered a couple of appetizers - Calamari & Oysters Rockefeller, both were outstanding. The calamari had a light, crispy crust on it, and the oysters had plenty of spinach, cheese & garlic. Would recommend both!
Ordered a wedge salad, and split it with my husband.. plenty of food, we've even asked them to divided 3 ways and they have... still plenty for 3 people. 
The Nawlins BBQ Shrimp appetizer is my favorite and I always order it for my entree. 
Juicy shrimp cooked in a broth of tomatoes, lemon, green onion and hot sauce.. Thank goodness they give you a huge piece of garlic bread to soak it all up.. 
They always have a nice selection of fish to choose from, however I do prefer wild catch over farm raised. 
The wine list is nice, and dining out on the patio makes for a lovely evening."}
{"text":"If I had reviewed Kings Fish house a year ago I'd have given it a 3 star rating. Good food but nothing memorable. For me it's just a convenient restaurant to go to and the food was good.

After not having gone for a year or so I went back for their lobster special. A whole 2lb lobster for $34. I also got a side sirloin steak and their new cheesy grits and saut√©ed spinach. Well the meal was incredibly good. So good that I went there again two days later. It's just a satisfying meal. Lobster is cooked perfectly and seasoned with a pesto sauce. The steak, surprisingly, is also excellent. I'm a picky steak eater and by far the biggest problem with most restaurants is they are afraid to bring the flavor. Well Kings really kicks their steaks up a notch with a delicious garlic butter dripping off when it comes to your table and its well seasoned. Just a great meal. Service is good and price reasonable. Located in the district.

The only thing keeping kings from a 5 star is that I'm not convinced their menu will be so great once the lobster special is over. I'll need to try something else on the menu to see if more of their food reaches that memorable level. To me a 5 star restaurant rating means its not just good but memorably so."}
{"text":"We keep going back to King's (even though the food is not as good as it used to be) because of the excellent service we receive from Karyne.  We have been going to King's since they opened and we used to go at least twice a week and have held private parties there where we have taken over the whole outdoor patio.  Now, we go only once a month and only when Karyne is there as she is always friendly and helpful and always remembers how we like our food and drinks.  I give her 5 stars but, unfortunately, can no longer do the same for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Attempted three times to come here for lunch or dinner and each time it got worse.  Slow and unresponsive.  Someone should train the servers!!  Our server said it's slow because \"they gave me three tables at one time\".  #wow"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. My favorite is the garlic dungenous crab when it's in season. The ambiance is tavern like with fish decor. The service is excellent. They are very attentive. The sea bass is also a favorite along with the halibut."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time and I must say I am FIVE star impressed. Service was great and it seemed like the entire wait staff/bussed staff was in synch. I always appreciate it when staff at restaurants are all willing to help, regardless of their \"job\". It's not often that I crave a fish dinner, but when I do, I can count on King's Fish House to hit the spot. The food is phenomenal, the service is excellent and the atmosphere is great. I would highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"OK so for starters i order a drink and some calamari.  The beer was nice and large and frosty which is always a plus.  This place was not busy still took almost ten mins to get my calamari.  This is an item that takes only 90 seconds to cook.  When i got my app I sent it back i don't like chewing rubber bands for an app.  OK so for a seafood house this place is already not to my liking.  The waitress suggested the nut crusted Sea bass, I wanted to believe the waitress when she told me that it was better then Chilean sea bass.  Then again the waitress that i had was not a good waitress at all.  I had to Flag her down for a refill on a beer and to get some water.  This is stuff that you ask your table before you leave the section.  After i put in my order with her i waited almost 15 mins for a sea bass that was about 3x4 piece.  Nothing huge but allot smaller then i thought i was going to get.  The first piece that i had was way over cooked even thought i ask the waitress to cook my MED.  I asked for the manager and told her that it was really overcooked.  She was able to talk me into getting another one and even that was a little over med but i didn't want to deal with it and be that guy.  After i finished my fish i had to wait for the waitress to finish filling sugar caddies before i could get my check.  No discount was given for the kitchen mistake.  So I drank my second beer and left.  I will not be going back to this restaurant.   I was not impressed with the Service or  the quality of fish that is used.


Key Point look at the trend for this restaurant WTH!!  If i was in management with  this company i would start looking for a new job.  you only have 54 reviews and most of them say this place sucks due to service."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE fresh sashimi.  Kings did not disappoint.  Al took my order and he was very knowledgeable and even suggested us substituting some of the sashimi options for salmon since I love salmon so much.  He also said that they ship and fly in their fish fresh several times a week, and you can totally tell!  The salmon was so fresh and melted in my mouth like butter.  I also ordered a spicy tuna roll that had tuna on top of it also (forgot the name) but it was very good;  I highly recommend it for any of you spicy tuna lovers out there.  If you want fresh fish, go to Kings! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing catfish nuggets here. The Mac and cheese was really good too. I atmosphere was nice and relaxed. The service was quick and the waiter kept us going.

This was not at all what I was expecting it to be. I thought oh look another fish fry joint. When you enter the decor lets you know right away that this place is more modern and not your typical fish and chips spot. The tables are spaced out just enough so that you can sit comfortably without feeling like your sharing a meal with the table next to you. If you would like they do have the option of outside seating. 

I need to give them one more go around but for now they are holding strong at 3 stars."}
{"text":"King's Fish House is in a nice location at The District at Green Valley Ranch.  The design of the restaurant is nice, and it is a comfortable place.  

I have found the service here to be reasonably good.  However, I am not a big fan of the food - it is serviceable, but nothing remarkable.  Sushi is not worth ordering here as it doesn't compare well to sushi restaurants that focus on this type of cuisine.

Other dishes, including the fresh fish and sides, are ok, but, again, nothing remarkable.

I do like many restaurants at The District (Lucille's, Kennedy, Settlebello), but this one just doesn't offer anything of great interest of exceptional quality in my experience."}
{"text":"They are a chain, they have a wide variety of sea food in the desert - so with that said it is a certain 5 start rating. Oysters are great, they change the ones available nearly every month. Salmon cakes are also another favorite of mine, along with their scallops. Their swordfish, Ono, crab, and lobster are all also good. My favorite apps of theirs are the calamari, fish tacos, or their salmon cakes (told you they were good).

Service is great! Sometimes the restaurant gets busy but they still are courteous. They know their whole menu and can offer suggests to those who are new. 

My boyfriend and I have made it a tradition to have one of our dates here monthly so that tells you how good I truly think it is."}
{"text":"Don't arrive 15min before closing, they'll seat you and no one will help you. The service here SUCKS!"}
{"text":"I have a new Henderson hot spot when I want seafood. King's fish house won me over in every form. Fresh fish, tons of options, outdoor dining, and exceptional service. I am wondering what took me so long to get here. 
My stepson wanted seafood for his birthday, and I think it may be a tradition after this to take him here. 
There are three dining areas, a large dining room, a sushi bar lounge area with a bar yet it is still family appropriate, and a patio with misters. 
The food options include lobster, different styles of crab, shrimp, oysters, mussels, and even sushi. Since it is salmon season, they also had a variety of salmon specialties. 
Between the four of us, we had king crab, calamari, crab cakes, spicy seafood chowder, a philly sushi roll, mussels, and shrimp. The only thing I would pass on my next trip would be the chowder. It indeed had a spice, but the broth was a bit greasy. Everything else I would have seconds of in a heartbeat!
Granted, this place isn't the cheapest. (4 people = $200 bill) But I think that is pretty average if you are expecting high quality fish. 
Perfect for a date night, or trying to impress a potential business partner or client. And just as perfect for a family craving seafood. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place from friends of mine and we decided to finally give it a shot a few weeks ago.  Not bad, but not good enough for me to drive down to Henderson just for their food.

We ordered their clam chowder and seafood platter to eat.  There is a sushi bar in case you want sushi, which we ordered sashimi from.  Everything was good.  For some reason we received special attention from the manager and received three - $10 gift certificates to come back again. I gave them away.

The one thing that bothered me about this place was the amount of stares we received for either a)being big people or b) being brown.  I'm not saying that the white people down there are racist, but I honestly felt like I was some animal under observation through the entire meal.

Prices are reasonable, and the food is good, but not enough to make me want more."}
{"text":"My family, friends and I are huge fans of Kings' Fish House and have been since the day they opened in the District.  It's our \"go to\" place for lunch and often for dinner providing we can sit outside.

The Idaho Rainbow Trout is out of this world and always perfectly done.  Ditto for the salmon.  My son loves the Parmesan Crusted Sand Dabs and orders them whenever they're on the menu.   Good Shrimp dishes and the salmon sushi (I'm a novice here) is excellent!  

I love fresh oysters and this is the place to go.  The Fanny Bays are always great as are a few of the others.  I always get an order of raw oysters before a meal and have never been disappointed.  My friend claims the Crab Louie Salad is the best she's ever had -and she knows!

The Caesar salad is outstanding and the bread is - well we get an extra order every time.  It's that good. 

The Con here is that thier Oysters Rockefeller are about the blandest, and most uninteresting  O.R. I've ever had.  

Most of the menu items stay the same but several dishes change daily.  

We love to eat on the patio and people watch.  The heaters keep the patio very comfy and warm during the winter.  

If there is a downside, then it has to be that dining indoors here is extremely noisy.  Sound bounces off the tile floors and walls and conversation at dinner is almost impossible.  That's why we eat on the patio.  

Service is superb and always has been.  
Smoking in restaurants is prohibited in Nevada (thank goodness) but if you sit on the bar patio you can smoke there."}
{"text":"This place was always kind of a mess, they don't even know what kinda eatery to be, but the fish, damn fish is soooo good. Bit of multiple personality restaurant but you're going there for the seafood and  it's worth going"}
{"text":"Went to King's Fish House on Saturday night after deciding 1 buffet a day was enough. Unlike at Lucille's, there was no wait for a table on the patio and we were seated quickly. It was my mom's second time at KFH and on her recommendation I ordered the parmesan sanddabs with spinach and macaroni & cheese. Despite having a slightly scary name, the sanddabs were a really mild white fish, like tilapia, and tasted mostly of the caper sauce. I also tried some of my mom's fish & chips which were tasty, but I would have preferred a beer batter over the bread crumb kind. My grandma's sushi was also pretty decent, but I thought it was a little over priced. it's 16 pieces for like $20, but 8 of those pieces are California rolls which I believe were made with KRAB. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to return, but wouldn't mind coming back either. There are TONS of choices on the menu and everyone is sure to find something. As far as seafood restaurant chains go, it definitely beats red lobster :P"}
{"text":"I had an assortment of sushi for an appetizer.  Fresh and well prepared.  For main course I had the Filet Mignon with grilled zucchini. The steak was cooked perfect.  A nice place to get an assortment of surf meets turf dining options."}
{"text":"Ate here once about a month ago, but with a large group and we all loved the food.  The prices are a little high but you expect that in a seafood place that has its fish flown in to this desert fresh.  Plus it is right down the road from my house so it is convenient.  I am told the seafood joint in the GVR casino is also good, apparently the Lobster bisque is to die for."}
{"text":"I wanted to treat my girlfriend to a wonderful seafood lunch to someplace we never tried before,and this place had great reviews. I literally watched my food get cold in the window while I watched my server serve several other tables that came in after my table. I spent over $150 on two people and she was a terrible server. I had to track down other waiters to get our drinks refilled and to ask for my food that I knew was sitting at the pass. I feel terrible tipping less than 25% because I used to serve tables, however I left our awful waitress $1 and a message on the bill, and I used no profanity. I politely told her to use better practices when serving customers.When I did find other waiters to serve us refills, she would come over and just drop the drink off without saying anything. I actually had to ask another waiter to grab our bill. It isn't like we were curt or loud, and I always make sure when I go out with people that they are polite to the waitstaff! She just ignored us. I will never recommend this restaurant or ever patronize this establishment again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We've lived in Vegas for about two years now, and I have to say that I think this may be the best chain restaurant experience we have had so far (and one of the best meals I've had here in general). I got the macadamia halibut with sauteed spinach and mac and cheese as well as a mojito and everything was on point. The fish was absolutely amazing, in fact. Everyone in our party was pleased with their meal, and we had great service out on the patio. A very enjoyable dining experience overall."}
{"text":"Service is weak.  Our waitress was slow and lazy.  I ordered a 2nd big bottle of Panna water for the table.  She just put it on the table without even refilling our empty glasses.  We sat on the patio near the door.  All of the wait staff kicks the bottom of the door so it flies open.  Very annoying as a customer when you are sitting close.

I had the scallops and they were very good.  I asked for steamed zucchini and it was done well.

My wife ordered the Halibut and it had a funky smell/taste to it...  She sent it back.  I noticed on the bill that the reason for sending it back was \"Don't Like\".  They should have chosen the reason code to be \"Skank Fish\" and not try to hide this issue from upper management."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time dining here and I will definitely be back!  The service was amazing.  The servers seemed like they genuinely wanted to be there!  The salmon was perfectly cooked.  The Mac and Chz was just OK.  I will definitely get the garlic mashed potatoes and corn again!  They accidentally brought the wrong side for my friend and they told us to keep it and they quickly brought out the correct order.  Great overall experience and recovery!"}
{"text":"lovely restaurant and wonderful food! the best thing to compliment such experience was having Moe as our server. 
we felt taken care of and comfortable and welcome. Thank u!"}
{"text":"I love Kings. I've been coming for 7 years. Great family place and have never had a bad meal!  Our server was Karen and she was amazing and so good to my son.  She even brought out a lobster. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!...Food and service  is always AMAZING... I crave the Ahi Poke almost everyday. I always sit on the lounge side, great place to bring the kids or just have a beer after work!"}
{"text":"Our first Visit to Kings Seafood!! Stopped in in the late afternoon a quiet time of day, breeze was nice as was the wonderful weather on the patio. immediately attended to by staff, Joe the waiter/bartender was our server and bartender for the afternoon,starting off with a nice Chardonnay then we chose to try the steamed manila clams a good portion and tasty broth  , next we shared a wonderful Chippino sp? full of crab ,mussels, clams,shrimp, fish,and calamari in a great tomato well seasoned soup or broth all served with warm bread. The service from our Mr Personality!! Joe was some of the best personal service I've had in Las Vegas and his suggestions were true and on the mark.We were  To full to partake in the Key Lime pie but there is always next time!!  Cheers and Bon Apetito"}
{"text":"Amie is the best server ever, and i am now a weekly dedicated customer! She recommended the sock eye salmon and it was perfect! Definitely coming back and asking for her!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. Been here a few times and the service and food was good. This time around I can't really say the same thing. First our service was AWFUL I mean awful. Our server Lacy probably had a total of 3-4 tables, she had one large party that left about the time that we ordered our drinks. She forgot our apps, she didn't even take all of our drink orders, she took two of the four people's and stormed off.  She was probably at our table a total of 3 times. Again, now she probably had 1-2 tables. All the servers were standing around, I was talking about how bad the service was right in front of a male server, I watched him laugh and continue folding napkins. My boyfriend and I work in a restaurant as well, and this service was so sad, it was embarrassing.. Not to mention it was my birthday and my friends went and told her and she said she would bring out a dessert, so my friend picked one out. She never brought it. It was 8:40 and the restaurant closed at 9. And she was just concerned about getting out of there. It was awful. On an up side the food was good."}
{"text":"This was my third and perhaps last visit to Kings Fish House.  Service is ok at best, not bad not good just ok. I started with a cup of soup that was barely warm, I told the server she apologized took it back to the kitchen and returned with yet another cup of less then warm soup. Dinner seemed to be rushed my wife ordered halibut and I had a version surf and turf with lobster medallions and a steak, the medallions seemed like claw meat and the steak was from a roast, and under cooked. The halibut was raw through out, how an expediter would let that leave the kitchen is beyond me. The server apologized and offered her another drink, which she charged us for, I didn't say anything but just took a mental note. One glaring thing that I always notice is that the manger never seems to be in a jovial or even in a pleasant mood and it shows. 

Just another over priced tourist trap in a locals market."}
{"text":"Usually pretty good but the last 2 times were awful.  Had 2 orders of unagi with my daughter and we left one sit. Avocado on caterpillar roll was yellow and mushy.  Time to find new sushi place"}
{"text":"Best way to describe kings is pappadeux... With a little less Cajun and a little more a-jun. ( i.e. sushi.... See what I did there?)

Great selection of oysters and fresh seafood, and I always respect restaurants that give you beer in a 22 oz glass. Nothing says \"I have a little bit of a drinking problem\" better than a beer that's a foot tall. But hey, this is vegas, and it's not like it's one of those beers shaped like the Eiffel tower. 

Service here was great. Really great. Our waiter really made our night our night out special. Very friendly, made good recommendations, knowledgable about the menu, but not too in your face. A real pro. 

He recommended the halibut, which was an excellent choice, and my wife who does not usually like seafood enjoyed every bite. Win win because I'm always trying to convert her into a seafood lover. 

Been here twice now and can't see any reason I wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"My family loves eating here! The staff are all very friendly, the hostess is always warm & welcoming & service has always been excellent. The food is always as described with great portioning & freshness. I like to start with an appetizer of sushi! My favorite item is the Seafood Cobb Salad, but I've ordered other items such as Ahi & Halibut & they're delicious as well. I've only ordered a bloody mary as a cocktail from the bar, but it's so delicious I order one every time I eat here! You can sit inside or outside...outside has an enclosed \"tarp\" for cold days. King's is very kid friendly with a coloring book for a menu that even has tattoos & the best kid's cup anywhere that's hard plastic with a hard plastic lid & a color changing bendy straw! I love to bring family here when they're visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I am pescetarian so this is right up my alley. This place has amazing oysters. I highly recommend getting the cold plate which has shrimp, crab, oysters and clams. I am not a huge fan of clams so I think I might see if they will substitute them for a few more oysters. This is a big enough appetizer for 2-4 people.  

I got scallops and mexican shrimp for an entree. 100% not disappointed at all. High quality and you can choose 2 sides from baked potatoes to veggies. I can be very picky with my scallops but these were cooked perfectly and seasoned enough to have a wonderful taste. My boyfriend got the swordfish and devoured it all. 

The service is wonderful. They are very fast so the wait is never too bad. I heard a plate drop and they were so quick to clean it up. Very impressed. The decor is a harbor and beach themed. You can read the random facts about some of the creatures of the sea."}
{"text":"Used to be a great place to eat, not anymore.

Prices keep going up, now $ 15 to $ 50 a person without drink, tax or tip included (cheeseburger is $ 15), it's getting nuts.

You used to get 2 decent sides with your meal, now you get one.  Want an extra side it's $ 6.

Portion size is smaller.  You are never supposed to notice, by I always do.  Even the sourdough bread that was awesome now sucks.

Want a premium American beer.  Forget it, it's all crap brews, they must get them cheaper.

Time to find a new seafood place, this one belongs back in San Francisco not in Vegas."}
{"text":"Yum! Ahi Poke Salad and Tuna Tataki Roll!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most over rated seafood restaurant chains. Had a tasteless and rubbery calamari and a non-descript order of coconut shrimp. Try the coconut shrimp at The Outback -- much better for a reasonably priced restaurant chain. Try the tender calamari with a fabulous sweet/spicy sauce at The Mood Restaurant located inside the Artisan Hotel (the rest of their menu, including the lobster mac n' cheese is very worthy of attention and repeat visits). We will not be repeating our experience at King's any time soon."}
{"text":"I don't know why but it has taken me about 4 times of coming to this place to realize it is just mediocre at best.  Looking back, some of the other reviews are right.  The food here is sort of...bland.  I've tried everything from steak, lobster, crab, cioppino, and various fish and all seem to miss the flavoring to make it memorable.  Don't get me wrong, some of the food here is good such as the clam chowder, sushi, and oysters but for the most part I believe there are way better options in town. 

Along with main entrees being bland, my biggest disappointment with King's are the prices.  $42 for 1lb of king crab?  $25 for cedar plank salmon?  This place is off the strip but somehow has the same prices.  I would understand if it was the freshest fish or generous portions but the whole deal falls flat.  

One positive note about King's is the Kid's menu.  The actual menu is something like 6 pages long with tons of games, puzzles, and tattoos!  The little one loved it and took it home to have for later.  

Bottom line, if you want some good seafood at a good value avoid King's.  If you want to overpay for bland food, come enjoy!"}
{"text":"Calamari was waaaaay over fried, dark brown, and burnt. Maybe the oil in the fryer needs to be changed. Artichokes were basic at best. A two star meal.... Made it Three stars because I enjoyed the Salmon Carpaccio & Geneva's (I believe that was our waitress' name) wonderful service."}
{"text":"At here recently and everything was super fresh and YUMMY!!! Our sever Ben was friendly and gave us great recommendations- as if u could go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable but nothing special.  Had some sushi rolls which were good.  The crab cocktail was delicious."}
{"text":"Very impressed. My first time here. Waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave us great recommendations. The food is terrific. Spicy seafood chowder was delicious. I had the blackened Ahi. My husband had scallops and Shrimp with spinach and garlic mashed potatoes. Best dinner I've had in a long time. They also have sushi bar."}
{"text":"Not bad for the seafood lover. The best thing: lobster bisque!

Service was friendly and prompt and the food was excellent.

This place gets quite busy on the weekends so be ready to wait a bit to get a table."}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant fairly regularly but saw the low end last night. My friend that I was meeting was running late but I got seated and then ignored. The server was back and forth to other tables but couldn't even spare a hello to me. I finally flagged down the receptionist who had gone over to get on the case of two other servers who were having an extended conversation while their tables were getting annoyed. The manager came over and was very helpful - got my drink and appetizer order going. The server finally came and apologized and I thought everything was resolved. Sadly, no. We ordered dinner and although I pointed at the Lobster Roll Special she decided I wanted sushi. So I got to watch my friend eat her meal. She's had the macadamia halibut before but last night it was really sweet so that she pulled the crust off. Mashed potatoes were over whipped to starchy mass. As she was finishing out server came back to tell me they were out of lobster roll but that she had talked the chef into finding one more for me. When it arrived the lobster was hard and rubbery. I ate it without complaining because by then we were about ready to leave. Our \"not ready for prime time\" server tried hard but seriously failed. They were really off their game last night."}
{"text":"To be honest the only reason we went here is that Lucille's was completely packed and we were starving. I'm so glad that we did!

Old Mama and Papa T. were in town and they were leaving the next day so we weren't in the mood to cook. We ended up at King's and enjoyed every minute of our meal. 

The server, Ben, was en pointe at taking special requests and making recommendations, as well as service in general. He rocked our whole meal from start to finish.

I ordered a special of the day--blackened tilapia with mango salsa. I can't say that I'd order the mango salsa again--it wasn't worth the extra price. Not enough mango goodness to even feel like I could combine every bite of fish with the salsa. But the fish was excellent and perfectly prepared. My sides were grits and spinach. These grits were a fantastic rendering of a food I have grown up eating! Spinach was a touch on the salty side, but I got over it.

My parents both enjoyed their meals as well--my mom a piece of salmon and my dad a surf-n-turf (though this restaurant is not one to list things in abbreviations such as \"surf-n-turf\") with a filet and lobster tail. The filet was really wonderfully prepared and a good cut of meat. 

I ordered a salad to come before my meal. Beware--a side salad is $5, which I think is pretty steep for what I got. Next time I will skip the salad and move on straight to the main course.

Definitely a recommended spot! I will probably be coming back again and again because of the different changes the menu offers and the good experience we had."}
{"text":"Just sat at the bar in the sushi area and it was so much fun! Tried the new yellowtail sashimi platter and it was an explosion of flavors! Plus if you sit in front of the oysters you can read the descriptions of them before you taste! I recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Average fish house. Fish is good quality but usually tasteless because the seasoning does not do anything to enhance the flavor of fish. I don't like how seafood is slaughtered with butter. Adding butter to everything does not make it taste better."}
{"text":"My overall impression was that it was too noisy - not music, just clatter and chatter. The acoustics were terrible. It was so bothersome especially in comparison to the quiet atmosphere at Terra Verde the previous evening, that I listened to my ipod to drown it out.

The meal was ok.  Sapphire martini was well chilled. Hearts of Romaine were a little wilted. Atlantic salmon was not overcooked. No waiting on a Monday evening at 8:30."}
{"text":"I seriously enjoy every meal I have here. Fresh, healthy, loaded with flavor, farm to table, I could go on and on not to mention that the service is spot on every time. The whole family can find what they want on the menu and it's always good."}
{"text":"We had a great dining experience at Kings Fish House last night.  Debra was a great server.  She was attentive to our needs but not over baring, and she just had a overall pleasant personality.  We started with a dozen oysters and they were delicious, fresh and huge!  My wife got the Crab legs, $47 for 1.5 lbs and two sides is a great deal for these crab legs.  I had the trout almandine and it was super tasty and they did not over do it with too much sauce and almonds.  There baked potatoes are wonderful, they coat them with salt or something before they bake them, so they are super tasty and perfectly cooked.  All this and they have a wonderful patio area to eat outside.  One suggestion I would make to them is to change the sushi bar to an Oyster/Raw bar!  Great job Kings!  We have a new favorite fish place."}
{"text":"I took my mother here when she was in town, as she was on a strict diet and could only eat very bland foods.  The kitchen staff was very accommodating in preparing her dish as requested, even though it clearly upset the chef in letting the dish leave the kitchen as it was.  My meal was fantastic, and not bland at all.  We ended up going back the next day for another meal there, and I was just as happy with another meal there.  I've been back once or twice since and have not had a bad visit.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Currently closed until December 7th for renovations (I have updated the business info on Yelp). Would be nice if King's updated their official website accordingly, as I showed up here after checking the hours on the website and found it closed.

Either way, looking forward to reviewing this place again when it reopens."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Great menu.  New England clam chowder is superb and the best fish tacos I've ever had.  Mel and John are great bartenders and Ty provides great service.  Ask John any rock and roll question."}
{"text":"Bad experience !! We found a wire on our pasta ( linguini with clams ) the manager stopped by and apologize. But still got the full charge for everything we got !! What if we swallowed?? We were so nice to tip the $20 ( 20%) of our bill even if they didn't took care of us !! Never comeback ! Food average not worth it ! At all !! Need to work on customers satisfaction!"}
{"text":"Not very good at all
Granted I've had my fair share of seafood in Cali and Hawaii but just not tasty

The only positive is the outside district seating"}
{"text":"While this a chain, there is nothing shabby about Kings Fish House. The fish selection in a landlocked city is quite impressive with a variety of fish and preparation options. The New England clam chowder was very good, and perfect combined with the complimentary sourdough bread. I chose the parmesan crusted sea bass, and was very happy with my choice. I also loved the mussels appetizers, which consisted of mussels in a spicy mayonnaise like sauce. The beer and wine selection was limited but well chosen. Our server was very engaging and knowledgeable, and she was more than happy to split checks for an entire table on business tabs. I went to this restaurant with several foodies, and we all left impressed."}
{"text":"I love the food.  Price are on the high side.  Sushi is pretty sparse.  There are not many rolls and not much variety in the fish cooler, but since they serve other foods I just use them as an appetizer.  Cost for two was close to a hundred bucks, but we ordered ala carte and were hungry.  The oyster selection is among the best available locally.  Price for 6 range from $11-16 - again on the high side of prices.  Service was quick and efficient.   Fried clams were OK, but not the best.  Lobster bisque was tasty, but not a lot of lobster chunks in it.  Sushi was OK, but not great.  I'd rank the sushi as a 6/10, but I'm pretty picky when it comes to sushi.  Everything tasted great.  We love visiting The District and this is my favorite restaurant on that side of that place."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, my girlfriend and I went into this place to try somewhere new, we were immediately met with a snotty attitude from our waiter (Ben). We were told in a very rude way, it wasn't happy hour after we were looking at the only thing on the table, the happy hour menu. Then when my girlfriend asked a question about which fish is in the seafood chowder, again we were met with the snotty answer \"seafood\" and then a laugh at her question. Can't rate the food as we walked out. The bread and water wasn't bad though."}
{"text":"A pic on Yelp of a Lobster Sandwich is what brought me back to Kings Fish House after 6 yrs. Yup, its been awhile. To my disappointment that Lobster Sandwich that brought me back was seasonal and no longer available. Boo! Why is a Lobster sandwich at a seafood restaurant seasonal??? Things that make you go hmmm..... Anyways I decided on some Grilled Scallops with Cajun Seasonings, grilled zucchini & garlic mash. Other dishes ordered at my table were crab cakes & fries, bbq shrimp skillet & garlic toast & grilled shrimp.We all really enjoyed our food! Everything was yummy! Everything came out hot however it did take a bit long often checking with our server who kept bringing us more yummy warm sourdough bread & butter to shut us up. Inside is always clean, cool & pleasant. My dish was simple but tasty. My husband wanted more shrimp in his dish & of course more scallops wouldn't bother me either.  Wish they would serve that Lobster sandwich year round though. I would definitely come back again but it would have to be on payday as prices are higher here especially if its your treat!"}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour.  I was Happy!!!  Grilled Artichoke....Calamari California rolls, chicken wings..........................  all Yummy!!

And a specialty Margi to top off the great couple of hours of Service."}
{"text":"King's is by far one of my favorite restaurants.  I dine here at least a dozen times a year including every Christmas Eve with my family.  

My go-to meal is the charbroiled rainbow trout with mac & cheese and sweet corn however the jumbo white Mexican shrimp is also a favorite of mine.  They also have great clam chowder, calamari and oysters.  I personally don't eat sushi but people I've dined with have said that the sushi at King's is delicious.  On one of my more recent visits I had a blood orange martini that was to die for!

King's has great food, great service and a fun atmosphere.  On every visit, my out of town guests always request at least one trip to King's, if not more."}
{"text":"The tuna tartare and the crab cakes are delish. Also offer a pretty solid beer and wine list and make some tasty cocktails.

I've only eaten here once so I can't speak for most items on the menu, but did have an enjoyable meal with good service and tasty food. 

If you're nearby, absolutely recommend stopping in for a meal. And it's not packed with tourists, so a great option for locals or those trying to skip the madhouse that is the strip."}
{"text":"We went in having no idea what to expect. What a wonderful surprise!  First and foremost, our server Joe S was AWESOME!! Personable and knew the menu - food (especially oysters) and beer, recommended dishes and was just overall exceptionally friendly. The menu changes daily and may seem extensive, but isn't hard to understand. The food was great. We had the large sushi sampler plate and the Ahi. The sushi was so fresh, the rice not too sticky. The Ahi just melted in my mouth!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite go to restaurants in The District. It's one of those restaurants where you can always count on a good meal. We've always had good luck getting a table right away when other restaurants in the area are running a wait for a table too. Just like every other spot in The District it's a breeze to park and get into the restaurant.

I like that within the restaurant they offer several seating options. There is a dining room, outdoor seating, and sushi bar seating. 

The service here is consistently friendly and attentive. Food is always served in a timely manner. 

The food is the main reason we continue to come back time after time. There isn't a bad dish on the menu and offerings change slightly depending on the season. The sourdough bread that starts every meal is delicious and addictive. The sushi menu is extensive and always fresh. One of my favorites is the Macadamia Nut Crusted Alaskan Halibut with buttery sauce on top. It's always fresh and full of flavor. My recently discovered favorite is the Sauteed Farmed N'awlins BBQ Shrimp. This is one amazing stew of Cajun style shrimp and seasoning with rice. Wow! The last bite was as good as the first. It packed some heat and serious flavor."}
{"text":"Against my better judgment (3.5 stars on yelp), I tried this place for lunch.  Their patio was really cute and the menu looked fine.  I ordered a salad that was okay, minus the cheese that was spread (like cream cheese) all over the bottom of the plate. The bread and butter was excellent.  The cole slaw tasted fishy (eeeewwww) and I *think* the waitress said their homemade mac and cheese was made with Velveeta and she commented, \"It's really good\"  (it wasn't, it was totally gross).  The fish was mostly batter but wasn't horrible.  The service was okay too.  All in all, I wouldn't return to this place, I don't know or understand what's going on in this kitchen."}
{"text":"I normally like this place well enough but the last two times have been utter crap. Last year I came and had the ceviche and got food poisoning and felt ill for about 2 days. For some reason me and the same friend as last time came back to grab some food again possibly for my birthday. WOW have I never been so disappointed in this place. We got in at about 8:30 a safe amount of time I was thinking before they closed boy were we wrong. Just about everything went south from there starting from the beginning. 

Drinks, I had a regular iced tea and when it arrived it was almost clear WTH and it was sent back for another. When it came time to get a refill it was refilled with the tropical iced tea which is a abomination to me. 

Our order was taken and the sourdough bread was dropped off. Last time I was here i remember the bread being toasty warm but I thought nothing of it being cold. Before my friends Caesar salad and my order of half dozen oysters on the half shell arrive the waiter tells him they are out of the Filet Mignon and so he proceeds to order the Chicken Parm which he has enjoyed in the past. At the end of the appetizers a man whom I assume was a manger tells me they are out of Linguine for my Seafood Jambalaya and hand me a new menu and is about standing over me waiting for a new order after he gives other options. I tell him to come back later. I finally decided to get the N'awlins BBQ Shrimp recommended by the waiter.

The entrees arrive my order looks good and is tasty except for the fact they have cut up a whole lemon that is mixed in with the sauce and they appeared to look like a yellow squash...YUCK Bitter Face as a chew into the lemon piece another WTH moment. My Friend fared worse than me I think. His Chicken Parm was kinda lukewarm and the pasta side had no sauce and the 2 sides that are included with the meal were never brought out. In his words \"They totally microwaved that shit\" \"I would not come back if they were giving it away\". The manager did decided to comp us 2 free desserts for the lack of items from the menu but it could not take away the resentment that we just paid for this. 

UGH!!! what can I say but \"I will not come back to this location ever!\".
Should have gone with my gut instinct and go to Lucille's BBQ.
Service was a 3 Star effort but quality control was a resounding ZERO."}
{"text":"Never coming back here again! We live in the area and come here often, but after today's experience - We WILL NOT be coming back! The hostess on April 11th (short gal, black hair pulled back in a braid) should not be a hostess! She was incredibly rude, her vague answers to our questions about seating, her body language suggested our arrival was annoying her or interrupting her day! After the confusion of where to sit, she forgot to send a server over, but 10 min later she came back and told us to MOVE tables ( even though she sat us there!). She didn't say it nicely either! Suggested that \"she was clear\" in her instructions and that we (the customers) were wrong!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch early today in the lounge area. Our server Celeste was awesome she made great suggestions and was prompt during our quick one hour lunch break! Food was fresh and delish. We will deff be back to see her!"}
{"text":"We decided to come here as the Presidio in the District is no long there.  I am not a big seafood eater at all and looked over the menu which has choices of chicken, steak and burgers for the non seafood eaters.

I decided to try a burger which was a first at this place and it was one of the best burgers I have had in a long time, what a surprise that a fish place would make such an amazing burger.

It has been over a year since my last review of this place and they have really taken the time and strides to improve and be more competetive.  I say they have accomplished this.  The food has improved, the service has improved and this is a place we will give a try again.

As a side note, Benjamin was our waiter and he was very friendly, extremely attentive making sure that one of my pet peeves, my glass sitting empty and having to ask for a refill, this DID NOT HAPPEN.  He was awesome with a great attitude and very helpful on food choices.  He is a true asset to this place and if you have the chance to have him as a waiter, do it..."}
{"text":"Kings Fish House is \"on the edge\" of greatness.  They have the ingredients to be great,  but the prep was just off the mark.  A big plus for me was that the food was not salty as most restaurant food is, but that may explain some of the prior reviews of bland.  What some call \"bland\"  i call clean pure flavors, but that requires proper cooking to be great. 

Lets back up to the Oysters though.  I LOVE Kumamoto oysters on the half shell.  Usually they are small and plump and sweet.  We almost didn't order them because the price was more than $2 each for the dozen.  What a waste.  These were SUPER small,  less than half the size of my pinky and thin and slimy and grey, not plump and white.  They tasted just OK, but not great.  We had just had a dozen Kumamotos at TIDES across the street at GVR the week before and they were EXCELLENT.  It was like the chef at Kings ordered a different \"grade\" of oysters, the cheapest ones on the market and then charges more than anyone in town.   When we mentioned to the waiter they did not compare to across the street,  soon the manager brought us a free half dozen of Mermaid oysters.  Nice gesture, but not great either. The good ones are out there, just order the right grade chef.  

Now the entrees,  I had Lemon, Nut Crusted Sea Bass. Grilled zucchini and sweet corn.  The flavor on the fish was excellent, BUT it was overcooked.  Without the lemon sauce it would have been dry.  2 minutes less on the grill would have been flaky and perfect.  the zucchini was BURNED, only some pieces were edible. Again if not burned, flavor would have been good.  corn was good, but not sweet and not buttery as the waiter described. Sliced off the cobb is yummy, but toast it a little more with butter and it could be great like skite corn from texas. 

My husband had Sword fish picatta, corn and Mac n' cheese.  His fish was good.  His Mac n' cheese had good flavor, but again OVERCOOKED to dry and pasty.

Like I said, had the potential to be EXCELLENT if the cooking was correct.  At pretty steep prices, I won't be back.until I hear they have a new chef.   I'll head across the street to TIDES at GVR where the fish is cooked perfect and the oysters are da bomb. 

what a shame as the outdoor seating at Kings is quite nice."}
{"text":"Also, id like to say the bartender twyla is so nice and friendly! I wish she were here every time we came in!"}
{"text":"I have gone to Kings at least once a month for at least 6 months now. I find that their service and food are always good. The sea food is brought in daily, at least that is what my server told me. I know we are in the middle of Nevada with no ocean in sight but for fresh fish, this place is pretty good. I do not trust too many places who serve fish in Las Vegas but I have always had great food at kings. I must say their choice of oysters is amazing. If you like fish, give this place a try. I have had a steak once but a steak is a steak! I had one situation the last time I went however. The table next to us had some small children who were running around and somewhat disruptive. I did not complain but it was rude of the parents to allow their kids to run around and yell. Before I could say anything or complain, the manager came out and quitely delt with the situation. The parents of the children took care to keep them seated and somewhat quite after that. I like that management took such great care to insure that the other customers could enjoy their meals in peace. The situation was taken care of quickly, tactfully and everyone was happy. I really appreciate it."}
{"text":"I know what you are thinking - you want to run away because I am reviewing a chain!  I live within walking distance of so many chains and Eric R. and I had never been here together.  This was our second date night in the District.  We had an excellent waiter Adam - and enjoyed our dinner on the patio in perfect weather.

I have come a few times on my own and stuck with the soft shell crab sandwich.  It was compelling on the menu because the season for soft shell is almost gone, but I noticed yellowtail on the menu in the charbroiled section.  I went for it and got northwest veggies (caramelized shallots, sugar snap peas and carrots) and summer grains (6 types of wild rice) - we split this don't worry :) added the Southwest salad (avocado too mmmm the unexpected) and Eric R. ordered the wild salmon tataki roll.  It ended up being a tad spicy for him.

To go with our seafood, I had passionfruit iced tea.  Adam refilled our drinks and gave us lots of bread very quickly.  He was attentive and friendly.  The good service and decent food makes me want to return.  I could even just go for some side dishes!"}
{"text":"Oh my goshhh. This is the restaurant if u love fish/seafood. I have never seen such an extensive menu, food wise & also the back is as big with libation choices, wines, beers, you name it. They have it all, including sushi, chicken & steak in case you have a \"fish are friends, not food\"person(haha) in your group. Our  group had halibut, & swordfish, with calamari &crabcake appetizers. The food was divine!! I do hope to dine here again! With each entree, u r given a choice of 2 side dishes. The zucchini slices were grilled to perfection drizzled I think in a light olive oil for added flavor. My 2 nd was macaroni & cheese..I had to do it. I knew it was going to be worth it. Creamy & perfectly flavored comfort food.  A few people ordered baked potatoes that were humongous with all condiments  adorned  to your liking.  Service was excellent. This place was outstanding. My tummy is growling again just thinking about the food. If u enjoy seafood, this Is your stop!"}
{"text":"Sushi bar great while we were waiting for table. Oysters were great. Ask for Craig the manager.  He will make sure you get the proper service.  Unfortunately we had less than great waiter but they sent a great waitress to try to redeem it.  Worth a try but hope for a good server. ... that's 50 percent of the experience"}
{"text":"Tried this place on date night with my husband.  We sat on the Patio area where they offered happy hour (you had to sit in the area with orange cushions per hostess).  We ordered Calamari & Ceviche for appetizers.  The Calamari was your standard dish, not amazing but not bad either.  The ceviche was a mistake but the chips they served with them were yummy.  I ordered wine and it was a huge pour which is favorable, my husband ordered beer, cocktails were good and reasonable.  For entrees we ordered the fish and chips was was GREAT.. and the grilled trout.  My husband said it was good and he ate it all.  I saw a couple people ordering this amazing looking salad, I think it was the Louie, it looked like a masterpiece.  I will try that if I ever go back.   Server wasn't friendly but he was attentive and we had what we needed when we needed it."}
{"text":"Oh my gawd! I visited Vegas last week & that's where my mother took me for dinner. It was my 1st time eating oysters they were surprisingly  delicious Hah . Also had the calamari super good & i had it all to myself! The crab there is to perfection best lobster I've had so far. & OH they have this chocolate cake that was oh my gawd delicious this place was one of the highlights of that week definitely coming back no doubt in that."}
{"text":"This should REALLY be a 3-point-something-low star review but I am giving the benefit of the doubt. My family loves this place and, although their palettes are less sophisticated than my own, I admit I got the crappiest dish at the table. I ordered the cioppino because....well, I LOVE cioppino. This one sucked. Seriously, it sucked. The broth was thin and flavorless and, most strangely, it had a really strange color. When I pointed it out to my mom, she comfortingly said, \"Yeah, I'd be afraid to eat it.\" For whatever reason, I wasn't, and I did eat it but the quality of the seafood was pretty low and dish was severely lacking overall.

That being said, the bloody mary I had was pretty good and they make a good cosmopolitan. The salmon cakes, fried scallop, mixed grains, and ahi steak I tried were all pretty tasty. I also enjoyed my walnut salad though it really could've stood to have apple/pear/cranberry or some sort of fruit. The salad dressing was acceptable but not delicious. The fresh bread they serve before the meal was very tasty and I approve of the sauce assortment adorning each table. 

Since my meal was less then stellar, I'm glad I wasn't really hungry to begin with. I'd go back and definitely order something else. It's perhaps my own fault, though-- what the hell was I thinking when I ordered seafood in the desert? This isn't the kind of place that flies fish in. (In my defense, however, they had sushi that I was wayyyy too smart to order! Ugh.)"}
{"text":"Went in for a drink and appetizer. Used to go to presidio across the way but I'm kinda glad they are under construction because I stumbled into this place.  Food was pretty darn good. Got my drink to go with it of course. Service was awesome, ask for Celeste! Finally, service with some personality. But I will definitely go back to try more."}
{"text":"The current rating on this place, as of 5/23/14, is three and a half stars. This is about right for King's Fish House. 

We started out with the calamari. The portion seemed about right but the breading was fragile. It came off easily and also tasted a little oily. Food Network told me that could happen due to the oil not being hot enough. 

My dining companion ordered the lobster bisque, which was missing a certain je ne sais quoi... He asked for the bisque to be replaced with a clam chowder and that, too, wasn't very good. It tasted under seasoned and floury. I figure if you are going to call yourself a fish house, then you should have a pretty epic clam chowder...

My cioppino was very tasty and well worth the cost. The crab claws were my favorite part but the broth brought it all together. I would order it again. My partner liked his fried shrimp. 

The service was good. Give it a try; maybe you'll think it's better than my three and a half star rating (but I doubt it)."}
{"text":"Well I had high expectations after reading the reviews and making my own list from Trip Advisor's top restaurants in Henderson. The clam chowder was good.
 Then everything went downhill from there. We started with a couple of appetizers, crab cakes and calamari. They both had so much grease on them that the plates were glistening. Glad we hadn't ordered anything else. It was so far from even being good that I am wondering how it even got on TA's list. Coming from Boston It is sad to think this is considered one of the best. For myself, my search will continue."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place a while ago. We were in Henderson a while back and wanted some seafood and this place just seemed like the obvious choice. Parking was easy and the restaurant is not far from the parking lot so that was nice. 

We started off with the crab cakes and an artichoke. The crab cakes were good and the artichoke was OK but, Gallagher's Steakhouse still has the best artichoke appetizer I've had to date. 

I had the 1 3/4-2lb lobster for an entree. This was also very tasty. Not tough or underdone, cooked just right. And the kitchen's timing was good. 

I live in the NW so it is a bit of a drive for me. The prices were a bit steep considering I can get similar quality elsewhere but overall not a bad place to pick up some seafood at the District if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The food is great here but it's totally overpriced. Make sure to dine in, takeout simply isn't worth it. Friendly staff but there are better options for a better price in the area."}
{"text":"My new husband and I have been going to King's for atleast four years every Saturday night for dinner. Great food, great service from our favorite waiter  David although everyone is fantastic. The food has always been perfect and if you aren't sure what to order, David always recommends something you are sure to love."}
{"text":"Just took my mom here for her birthday today because we wanted to try something different. Also, we didn't want to wait 35 minutes for a table at Lucille' s so we figured why not try out some something new! The hostess was pretty friendly and our service was on key :) The menu is pretty astounding for it had such a variety of seafood which I thought was amazing! I think I almost drove myself a little crazy trying to decide what to eat lol 

Now lets get to the food....They serve bread and butter before entrees and appetizers which was warm and a great start. We ordered sushi which we all shared and the Spider Roll was my absolute favorite!!!! My dad ordered angel hair pasta which had shrimp in it. My mom and I split the linguine with clams and it is a good thing we did otherwise we would be too full! The quality of the food was pretty good and I have to admit they don't dip on clams or shrimps in entrees they give you just the right amount. The portions of the food were sized just right as well in my opinion. I really enjoyed everything we ordered tonight! 

The only reason why I'm knocking down a star was for the noise level! Talk about noisy but I guess that is expected especially on a weekend in a packed restaurant. I think next time we'll ask the host for a table towards the front away from the kitchen as well.

Overall, pretty good food and a fun place to go! I definitely recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Charged for a 2 1/2 lb lobster when they served a 2lb. The only reason I found out is because the cardboard weight tag was served with my lobster. Embarrassing ...  1star because they fixed it.  But it makes me wonder how many people they rip off.  
Food tasted good... For what it's worth"}
{"text":"What an awesome dinner! Scott was our server; not only was he a phenomenal service... He helped us choose what to get for dinner, and chose perfectly, for each of us. We will definitely be coming back. That goes for me, and my family! Thanks Kings fish house... And Scott!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. After a poor experience the first time I was basically forced to go the second time. I figured I would come with an open mind and give it my full attention. We were greeted with a smile at the door and immediately seated. We didnt see our server for over 5 mins(had my phone paid attention). She was kind and took our drink order but didnt come back for another 5+ mins with our order 2 waters.  Were ready to place our food order by this time but she just dropped the waters off with no words and kept moving. 
  In my first experience at this place I realized they think they are some sort of \"High End\" special type place. Seafood in Vegas woo hoo. The pricing on the menu should mean High Quality and Attentive service. The service was definitely not that. 
  We ordered and appetizer(Crab cakes) and two entrees Swordfish and Softshell crab. The crab cakes came out fast but the plate was large and there were two small crab cakes with burned edges and a tiny ramekin of an indistinguishable sauce(1000 island mixed with tartar sauce?). No garnish and they were only a tiny notch above a frozen crab cake from the grocery store. 
  The entrees took about 21 mins which is not horrible for a friday night, unfortunately we were there on a saturday afternoon when the place wasnt even busy. The softshell crab was over breaded and came on a bed of french fries that ranged from mooshy and undercooked to hours of drying under a heat lamp. My girlfriend said the crab itself  tasted ok but was not nearly a $20 plate of food.
  I had blackened swordfish. Expecting to have seasoned crust on the top I was quite surprised when the fish came out with a light wet red paste of seasoning on top sitting in a plate of juice.  I started eating and the flavor wasnt bad but the texture was really off with the pasty seasoning and rubbery fish. I went to the roasted zuchini for a reprieve but was even more put off when I realized the zuchini was basted in a ridiculous amount of fish juice. All this made more sense when I got about 2/3rds the way through the fish. Raw, straight up raw swordfish which explains the ridiculous amount of juice on the plate and nasty texture. Now I dont know how long it takes to cook swordfish but surely in the time it took to deliver our food they could of cooked the fish.
 This is the kicker here though. I stopped eating and just picked at my girlfriends fries. Leaving the fish bloody raw side up sitting on my plate. The waitress returned to the table 2 times to refill our waters but never once asked why I wasnt eating nor even noticed the uncooked fish on the plate near the edge of the table. She even came back a 3rd time and removed our plates dropped the check and didnt comment at all. We paid and ran for the hills. Gladly my girlfriend now understands why I dont want to go back. Also the Potato salad was tasty."}
{"text":"The food is great, And the price is not bad. Good place for lunch with the family. The strawberry lemonade is great. I"}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday afternoon, b4 the dinner rush and there wasnt that many people seated , with the exception of one very affectionate couple, I thought the girl was going to swallow her boyfriend whole. She was literally on top of his lap when we walked in? crazy. We were in the mood for good seafood so we didnt order sushi but they do offer it. Kinda pricy place, but it was good. I went with the blackened catfish with mac n cheese with veggies. oh so good. everything I tasted was delicious. I didnt order the dinner salad and glad I didnt but I did clean my plate, everything was so good. Mybf  ordered tilapia. kinda bland in my opinion but he doesnt like salt... I do... i like herbs and spices.. and this place had it. even on the veggies. Its a must try - hard to turn down the bbq nxt door but if you can you must try this place. 
Side note: we felt like a mexican whole stole something @ macy's everyone was looking at us--- not the couple making out?? If it wasnt for this feeling of being stared at I;d have given an extra star. But the food alone - 4.5 stars. small portions, but u know what they say. If you want to be the smaller size, order the smaller size ;)"}
{"text":"OMG this place is off the hook...definitely worthwhile to drop by and get some great seafood however don't think this is a normal \"joe's crab shack\" type of place or \"boiling crab\"...P.S. for you beer lover's try the King Crab Honey Ale...pure deliciousness!"}
{"text":"We frequent Kings.  I usually get the catfish po boy, which is a huge piece of catfish on a baguette with a side.  My wife has gotten the Nawlins BBQ shrimp, a dish Kings is known for.  The last couple of times, this dish has not been as consistent with the spicing and the shrimp have been overcooked.  So, be advised, but when the dish is on, it's fantastic.  We usually get a soup to start, and I have had several of the sushi rolls.  All are winners.

They have seasonal specials.  The spiny lobster has been our favorite, they are delicious.  The bar is also solid.  Decent beer/wine menu.  Overall, it's a very comfortable place to get some good food.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I've been here several times only because it is close to my home. The food there is really just ok. Go somewhere else if you are looking for very good fish."}
{"text":"Incredible seafood (their selection of oysters is top notch), the cedar plank copper river salmon was TO DIE FOR, and the service is always impeccable. Our waiter was one of the most attentive I've ever had, as well as sweet and friendly, engaging us in conversation and offering great suggestions. Even the bus boy was incredibly polite and going out of his way to clean even the smallest items off of our table when we were done. The management is definitely doing the right thing here."}
{"text":"We came at around 2 o clock place was pretty dead. It is clean all the way through and into the bathroom. The service was alright and the prices were moderate. The entrees selection was limited and not what I expected from a big seafood restaurant. Their small hot plate selection is pretty good and where I made most of my selection from. The ahi poki salad needed a bit more seasoning help from us but the ingredients were really fresh and it had lots of tuna in it unlike many other poki I have had in Vegas. The crab cakes (2) were perfect the most moist crab cakes I have ever had. The fish tacos (3) were delicate, clean and fresh tasting. The baked mussels (about 10 small ones) was not overpowered with the mayo and spicy sauce. The waiter warned me that it was spicy. It was really good but not spicy at all. I believe the menu said it had avocado in it, I don't recall any avocado in it but I did not miss anyway. Spider roll was good. Overall I like that they were careful to not over season anything. All the ingredients were fresh and the meal was really light on my stomach. The total was $57 for the five small plates and an ice tea we were stuffed."}
{"text":"Always a great place for seafood.  Our server was very nice and super friendly.  The oysters are always fresh and the beer cold.  Was the first date with my wife so we always enjoy going back."}
{"text":"I'm all about the seafood! So when Jessie B's birthday came up Dyanna L suggested we check out Kings Fish House. Yay!!

Since it was a Thursday night it wasn't that busy so there was no need for a reservation. (On a Friday or the weekend I'd make a reservation.) We were seated quickly in a nice large booth. Since Dyanna had been here prior we asked her what she liked. For our drinks I ordered a Hurricane, which was super strong, but still tasty. The birthday girl ordered a Mojito and Dyanna had a Spicy Bloody Mary. It was a hard choice for appetizers. King's has a huge menu and even sushi!! Yay! So we picked the Shrimp Taquitos and a Trojan roll. Both items were excellent. The taquitos had a whole shrimp in each one and they were topped with queso fresco and pico. Plus a side of guacamole. The taquitos had a really tasty spicy flavor and with the crunch of the shell it was a perfect bite. The Trojan roll was delish! It had tender spicy tuna. Mmmm! All three of us dug in. I would have been happy with just the appetizers, but entrees were still to come. Jessie ordered the seared scallops while Dyanna had the macadamia nut crusted salmon. Yummy! I ordered the seafood cobb salad with their house vinaigrette. It was the best salad ever! It had a row of chopped shrimp, scallops and crab. Omg amazing! The vinaigrette had the perfect flavor to enhance the seafood. It also was huge! 

Our waiter was on point, super friendly and very sweet. He answered all our questions and made sure our drinks were filled and that each course came out smoothly. The decor was relaxing and cool too. Lots of dark wood and vintage tiny tiles of black and white lined the floors. There is also patio seating which looks very inviting. 

It was a great place to celebrate Jessie's birthday! All three of us left full and happy. It was truly a perfect night with amazing friends and food and drinks that matched."}
{"text":"Ahhhh, where to start? This place is superb from the time I opened the door 'til the time they kicked me out (I didn't want to leave.) The hostesses were more than friendly and accommodating. I was immediately sat on a busy Friday night. Within a couple of minutes was greeted by Celeste (my server) with a huge smile and friendly demeanor. Not too long after that came the manager on duty Craig. He was so personable, helpful, and more than willing to be of service. He suggested their new cedar plank BBQ rubbed salmon. Boy was he right on the money! It was phenomenal!  Celeste was very courteous and consistently checking to make sure everything was meeting my standards and the place of her employment's. The entire experience was great! Craig even came over several times to make sure my experience was great. We had quite a conversation, and me feel right at home. I'd recommend this place to anyone. If you're ever by stop in, ask for Celeste, and try the dessert!"}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday night as that is my only available \"date night\" due to a grueling work schedule. Was really craving some seafood and since it had cooled down from 600 degrees down to 101, I wanted patio seating. King's Fish House it was. 

Parking as usual was a pain in the ass being that it's the super trendy District and people have to walk their dogs, get coffee and be \"seen\". 

We walked in and were greeted by a hostess who seemed to have no clue as to what her job was or how to do it. We kept asking about the patio and she was super confused. Maybe she wasn't aware that they had one??? After some effort she sat us on the patio (table 204 to be exact and I'll elaborate later on how I know that). Alex was our server and he was amaze-balls!!!! After ordering our cocktails and wine, he answered some questions and made suggestions to us, which I love about a good server. The patio was perfect, not too crowded and the people watching was stellar. Plenty of Green Valley Guys and Girls to giggle at their choice of outfit and trendy, sparkly jeans. This night did not disappoint. 

Okay so our food. . . the food with the exception of some of the raw oysters, was perfect. Alex checked back appropriately and swung by the bar to grab more cocktails for us. During our dinner we had two different sets of male servers, step out on to the patio making mention of 204. Note to respective female patrons, you will never go without drinks or condiments on King's Fish House male server's watch. Very subtle guys. Anyways, Alex noticed that some of my food was left untouched, upon asking me why I just explained it didn't taste right. He immediately involved a manager and he was very contrite and offered to remove it from the bill. This is upsetting to me for the following reasons; A. Do that many people complain to get free stuff? Duh, I already know the answer to that. B. I ate almost all of it, I should be charged for it. C. I was told sorry and offered every way to make it better. That is sufficient enough for me. 

Well, good old Alex and our friendly manager guy took it off our check anyways. Upon receiving the check of which, low and behold table 204 we were indeed, we saw that he removed it. We then payed the total and tipped on the full amount prior to the comp!!!!!!! Pay attention and learn something, some of you. The comp had nothing to do with service!!!!! Servers shouldn't be penalized for that, so we left a bit extra just for his personality and enjoyed our dessert and coffee and left. Thank you King's for a nice meal and an environment in which to enjoy it in."}
{"text":"It's been nearly 2 years since my original writeup so time for an update..

First and mostly importantly Kings has NO CORKAGE for all of 2010!!! Get an awesome wine from Whole Foods across the way and bring it the hell in. Our waitress was kind enough to put our Reisling on Ice.. sweet! 

Now for the food:
*Idaho Trout has gone up quite a bit since '08! It was $17 last night (with choice of two sides), but still worth it in my book. I had the mashed potatoes (yum), and mac n cheese (not so yum, way too dry).
*My husband had a shrimp curry dish. I know you're thinking WTF curry at Kings? But it was quite delicious actually! Served with jasmine rice, pineapple, and snap peas we were pleasantly surprised by how awesome it was. It was also a decent value at $16 - included 14 large shrimp !

Overall a pretty damn good dinner for $40 (oh yeah +$8 for the bottle of wine we bought at Whole Foods to bring over!)."}
{"text":"My fiance and I are Las Vegas locals, and often frequent the restaurants in the Henderson/Green Valley area.  As folks who work in the service and hospitality industries ourselves, we are often on the look out for restaurants that offer both good service and great food!  King's Fish House is one of the better seafood restaurants in Las Vegas, and has a good reputation.  We have been to this place before, and almost always have a great time.  The menu is huge, with many items to choose from (not just seafood); in fact, on my most recent visit here, I ordered a Southwestern Salad with blackened chicken.  Our server was a great guy with a lot of information on the menu  items.  He offered some suggestions to help us decide which items we would choose for lunch, and he was courteous and personable.  A win-win!

King's Fish House has definitely taken a more hand's-on approach to making sure that the service is great and that the food comes out fresh and in a timely manner.  Always a bonus when you visit a restaurant with a good reputation and it holds up over time.  I highly recommend this place for lunch, dinner or their awesome desserts"}
{"text":"I love kings! I've only ever had the n'awlins BBQ shrimp but it's soooo delish and spicy! Yummmmmmm. It's always 50/50 wit the servers we either get a great serve or a total douche that ignores your order for your child. im sad over the years they have gone down hill. and when I order something\"from the skillet\"  it was always fun to get it in an actual skillet...now the prices went up and end up with a smaller portion on just a plate, bummer."}
{"text":"always happy to eat and drink here!  Jen started our service but went off the clock, so sorry that happened wish she had gotten the tip.  Jen makes a fabulous pamagranite martini!! Had the oysters from Virginia, fresh and tasty, then the clam chowder was hot and happy tasting. Finished dinner sharing the swordfish tacos with my hubby and one each was perfect. Thanks again for another great meal"}
{"text":"Happy hour from 4pm-7pm Monday through Friday. 

My friend works close by and we were in a rush to grab a quick bite before going to the Smith Center. 

The specials is honored throughout the restaurant, but the parlor tends to be empty. We sat down around 5:30 and were attended to quickly. We ordered the hurricane and the cactus pear margarita to start. At $6 a piece, they are very reasonable. 

A few minutes later we ordered some oyster shooters, fish tacos, ceviche, and a spicy tuna roll. The food was okay at best. Nothing made us reel back and say we needed to come back for more. Certain items such as the spicy tuna roll just felt like a rip off. In fact, we ended up closing our tab and going elsewhere for another round of HH goodness."}
{"text":"We returned this past Saturday, and I must say I loved everything!  The service, the food, no corkage  - it couldn't be better.   They offer an extraordinary value with the free corkage and the fact that every entree comes with 2 sides.  This time I ordered my own Swordfish Picatta, which I ate as slowly as possible to extend my pleasure!"}
{"text":"Every meal here is a treat, but when Maine lobster is in season, we can't resist the classic lobster rolls... We had our first taste of this amazing dish in Boston a couple of years ago, and then we were so disappointed to find that nobody here in the desert made anything like it. Then last year we found them here, and like all King's creations, it is wonderful. We tried the \"Connecticut\" version, which is butter based instead of mayo, and it's delicious but the classic is even better for our tastes.
Ben takes awesome care of us always, but if we come in when he's not there everyone is great!  This is a very well managed place.
Oh yes, the oysters are well presented with a surprising variety (plus they are listed by type and source, a fantastic way to develop an understanding of what kind we actually like!).  All of their fish is sustainable and made exactly how you like it.
You can probably tell that we eat here often, and considering the tremendous selection of fresh seafood in the valley, it says a lot that we think this is the best."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday.  Loved the environment here.  We had a cool waitress.  The food was excellent.  We started out with shirmp for an appetizer. I went with clam chowder next.  Then a got a halibut with a parmesion breading.  I was in heaven.  I loved my meal.  The whole table enjoyed their meals as well. I will come back again.  Great service, excellent food and love the ambiance."}
{"text":"The food is rockin' at this place.  We would go there more often, but it is a bit pricey.  Husband is not into fish, but they have a good variety of other options that intice him."}
{"text":"Fantastic seafood: they offer regional specials, wild fish and Cajun seasoned dishes. The patio looks like a cute outdoor area from New Orleans and the interior design is very classic, beautiful and comfy! 

The only drawback is the service: in general the service quality cannot keep up with the food quality. Ben however is very charismatic and attentive - one of my favorite servers in town! 
Update: David is also great- he is very accommodating and nice!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Henderson to visit family, I had the opportunity to eat here on two different occassions. Each time I managed to score a table outside without any reservations. All in all, I thought the food and service were good. My wife said her food was \"excellent.\" The only down side were the oysters. I ordered a dozen oysters on the half-shell. A couple tasted a little off. That weird taste -- if you know what I'm talking about. I also ordered oysters Rockefeller. Again, one of the oysters was bad. Other than that, everything was good: crab cakes, baked mussels, calamari, and sirloin steak (I know...why order steak in a fish joint?). If it wasn't for the oysters, it would definitely be four stars. And I'll go back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place both times we went. I don't mind paying a decent price for good food but I have to say $18 for fish & chips that are less than mediocre is a bit much. 1st time we thought they must just be off their game. 2nd time proved they are not worth our time and money."}
{"text":"ehhhh. 
i've had better seafood. 
maybe i'm picky cause i eat seafood at least 4 times a week. this is a typical seafood restaurant where very american-ized families can enjoy a dinner. 
i thought it was going to be more unique because i imagine the district to be a very hip place. but it was very mundane. nothing stood out at me. 

granted, the food wasn't bad. maybe it deserves a higher rating, but i thought it was a bit overpriced for what was being served. and so that was a pretty big disappointment. 

so yeah, if you don't like seafood, you would really like this place!"}
{"text":"We have been to Kings many times, and we consistently get good service, and wonderful food.

This last visit was exceptionally fantastic.  Normally I would give 4 stars, however the server was totally above and beyond anything we have ever experienced there, and thus the 5 star review.  

In addition to the wonderful service,  the outside atmosphere is also great.   It was a cooler night, and we sat outside, as they have the ability to close in the patio, and heat it.   

We were there with another couple, and we both ordered the Ahi Carpaccio, which was spectacular, as well as king crab legs.   Everything was fresh, and perfectly prepared.  We  willl look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"The location in the District is awesome and they have a covered patio with plenty of seating. Managment seems to be on top of their game here the food and service was excellent. I have been to King's many times in San Diego and I think the prices and menu are pretty much identical."}
{"text":"If you like bad nursing home food, then you will love King's fish house. Seriously, they are minutes away from being on Kitchen Nightmares. When we arrived, it took almost 10 minutes for our waitress to greet us. I had just said that if we wait another 5 minutes I was going to walk out, we were 2 minutes away from that when she arrived. She was very apathetic and it was obvious she was just going through the motions. We were served some extremely sour, sourdough bread. For the record I enjoy sourdough, but this was almost inedible. After consulting my seafood watch card, I settled on the Parmesan crusted Alaskan Sanddab. I chose garlic mashed potatoes and mac and cheese as my sides. When my meal arrived the fish was piping hot and the sides were stone cold. The fish was not too bad, there was no seasoning and really no lemon sauce which was disappointing because it would have actually been a good dish otherwise. Unfortunately, it was a bland, slightly oily mess. I could almost hear Gordon Ramsay screaming about the lack of seasoning. The mac and cheese was not only cold, but completely flavorless. The garlic mash was OK, but nothing special. My husband had the fish and chips. I am pretty sure the cod was frozen and the fries again were edible, but nothing spectacular. 

Our waitress was not very friendly, but she went through the motions. I did observe her playing with her mouth and lips after I had eaten, which completely grossed me out. I observed another server push a falling knife back onto a plate with her chest, this plate of food was full and on its way to a patron. Again I could hear Gordon screaming in my head, \"Just set the plate down!\"

Kings is a dinosaur in the dining world. They are stuck in an era that no longer exists. People want flavor, not food that they can cook themselves at home (and a better version at that). The place was almost empty on a Friday night and many of the patrons were very senior. Kings really needs to modernize if they hope to survive in this foodie city."}
{"text":"Its good,  and i like the atmosphere and staff, but i think a little over priced. One time had some raw oysters that literally tasted like toilet water, i didnt want to be a dick and complain. i guess it was my fault , they were from mexico, i should have picked the ones from laguna? i duno. The bread is wonderful, and i love that little sushi bar.
Got thegumbo??, Dont remember, some kind of stew with tomato. No taste."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had dinner here for the first time. Hubby ordered salmon with veggies and loved it. Since I'm not a huge fan of seafood, I ordered the chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and veggies. It was quite tasty. Weather was nice that evening, so we dined in the patio area. Although we were in the patio area, we were never neglected. Great service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yummy fish if your in the mood for this. I had the macadamia nut crusted Mahi Mahi.  very delicious and the fish was just cooked just right. Awesomeness!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place for seafood in Henderson. I've had the raw oysters here before and they were very good. This time I ordered the seafood Cobb salad which was also very good. The portion was huge. The spicy seafood chowder was extremely spicy."}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day with my whole entire family (16 people) they weren't able to seat us all together, so we had all the children sit in one table & the adults in another. It was definitely a tough situation but once everyone got their food it was smooth sailing from there. Food was a bit pricey for such small quantity but it was good. Their bread was amazing, clam chowder was fresh. Must say I wouldn't take a whole entire family back here again."}
{"text":"It wasn't terrible but the quality for the price was unreasonable. Husband had macadamia but crusted halibut with orange ginger sauce. He said it was very orangey and overall bland. I had the kings combo platter. The fish was excellent. The scallops and shrimp were not bad."}
{"text":"I have dined here on 4 occasions enjoying good food & great customer service each and every time.  The macadamia crusted fish is my favorite.    Eating the key lime pie is a moment you want to bask in forever and then you realize you are licking the plate and molesting the fork! Yum!"}
{"text":"I agree with other Yelpers it is hard to find good fish houses in the desert.  Thankfully this place does exist since whenever my mom visits she loves to go here.  It is a pleasant spot.  

The service is always very good.  Only one time did we have an issue where our server was fired mid-service.  That was kind of crazy but I think a one-off.  The manager immediately came and started serving us with no stop in service.  It was very strange because it was just me and my mom and my baby and one other couple in the restaurant.  So not sure what the circumstances were.  Nevertheless, no issues for us.  

We have had pleasant servers who have gone out of their way each time to make sure baby was happy.  Smaller side plates, food come out first for baby, the works.  I really appreciate this.  

I am boring and get the same thing every time.  Some kind of clam or seafood mix linguini.  Pinot Grigio is always super cold and very good.  My mom usually gets something different every time and every time it is good.  

I enjoy that they have a nice outdoor seating area with misters in the summer time heat.  It is in a great location right there at the District.  You can combine shopping and dining.  

Overall always great."}
{"text":"This place is amazing every thing is delicious my server I think her name was Libby but she was awesome! I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"The service is nice and the outdoor seating is comfortable with overhead heating during the winter. (The outdoor seating is much better than the indoor seating.) They have a kid's menu that comes with temporary tattoos.

The food is bland and underwhelming.  I've been invited to family dinner here several times. I don't know what the point is of paying $20-$30 for premium fish/seafood that just comes out tasting like \"eh.\" The food is really underwhelming.

This restaurant is ideal if you plan on inviting guests who are greatly impressed by the sight of an expensive and varied seafood menu but don't necessarily care about the taste of the food they're eating. Because while the food is totally edible/passable, it's just not particularly delicious or even memorable. At all.

The only thing I would consider recommending is the oysters."}
{"text":"The only real community restaurant in town.  They have real food cooked by real chefs.  Everything is cooked to order, and the fresh fish is always excellent.  It's the only restaurant I eat at in town.  Thank you Kings Fish House, for your great food and excellent service.  Everything on the menu is delicious.  I have been eating there for over a decade now, and they have been consistently great every time.  THANK YOU!"}
