{"text":"If you're looking for brunch or lunch or dinner or simply a drink off the traditional downtown strip, head here. Friendly staff, laid-back crowd, cool hidden location.  I dig it!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch. It was mediocre at best. Food that you could have made at home, without much flavor.  Food came quickly but service was slow for everything else....coffee, more silverware, etc.  Patio is relaxing."}
{"text":"Love love love to roll in here for brunch or for beers on the patio or around the cosy indoor neighborhood bar with the old school -NIAGARA STREET- sign.  Friendly prompt service. Great for gatherings, or to hear chatter and laughter... Great price points on things like cubano sandwich, steak frites, burger.... and the SPECIAL SAUCE they have for their fries (sweet p or regular) is remarkably addictive."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I were coming back from the CNE and decided to let Google maps bring us to the closest place for dinner.  The dining atmosphere is very warm and welcoming with a new era rustic feel to it. The menu is full of creative dishes, my girlfriend choose the steak and mushrooms sandwich while I ordered the jerk wings.  Both dishes were very pleasing and service was prompt and polite.  I would recommend stopping by if you're in the area or want somewhere a little  cozier then the heart of the city."}
{"text":"If you want to change it up from the Foggy Dew a block away, Old York is a nice alternative. The food is more authentic and tasty anyhow. The burrito and bruschetta are amazing, and my vegetarian ex-girlfriend could always find good options (though the burrito finally came between us).  Frequented by hipsters, knitting clubs, and baseball teams, it can fit more people that you would think.  Go early and get a spot on the patio though, and watch all the pig delivery trucks going into the slaughterhouse across the street (YUM!).  Oh, and you'll probably be killed in the basement where the washrooms are.  But like I said, the burrito is probably worth it."}
{"text":"Attentive and casual staff, great relaxed atmosphere and perfectly acceptable food. There is a real neighbourhood feel at old York. You can spot the regulars by their sense of pride, familiarity and ownership. Wide mix of patrons from after work suits to local hipsters. I ordered the magic mushroom wrap and magic it was. The mushrooms weren't overly doused in balsamic but had a nice, tangy and earthy taste. As a vegetarian, I'm a pro at picking out a good mushroom burger or wrap and the magic mushroom wrap at Old York is high on the list."}
{"text":"This is a love payment forward to my second home away from Halifax, Toronto.  I discovered this gem a while back when my good friend lived on the corner of Front & Portland. it wasn't a hard walk to clear your head full of partying up north in the Kawarthas the night or in some cases the week before.  Well my first experience the Old York was for breakfast. I ordered eggs benedict but not a benedict like we're used to here out east. You know, pouched eggs, some ham, an English muffin and some hollandaise sauce (real if your lucky) but usually Knorr's \"MSG hangover hollandaise like sauce\". I know some of you know what I'm on about here.  To my delicious delight I passed over the ham option and went for the smoked salmon, sweated spinach  (Just warm and limp but still bright green) arugula, on top of a perfectly cooked latke with REAL hollandaise sauce. For those not versed in traditional Jewish cuisine, at Latke is a round seasoned potato cake cooked in butter  - latke is a Yiddish term.  Well let me tell you! I ordered a round and because of the hangover I was shaking off, I bought a whole other round because the price was so great and I needed more of this breakfast debauchery to commit to my memory as a souvenir for home.  Fast forward to 2010!!  Last year I was on a business trip and I was cruising along Q.E.W. with my friend Tan. She huffed \"I'm so hungry!\", so boom I take a note of where we were and I said, \"have you ever tried the Old York?\" and she said where's that? Exactly! You have to know where this place is by word of mouth or you'll never know of it.  So I gave her the Latke story and bam!! she was sold in a second only to forge through lunchtime traffic to hit Niagara St which runs at an angle off Queen through King.  It changed a bit since the last time I was there. I ordered the wings which were charbroiled with flavor like no other. It was served with a pita type of chip and dip. The wings had the perfect balance of seasoning and a fantastic aioli type (not exactly) dip. Huge serving. Tanya went for a pasta which I thought was silly with all the other enticing menu options but she said it was fab and after a sample, I had to agree with her.  A few weeks after I returned to Halifornia I got a txt claiming that the Old York was her new \"go to\" place. She also asked how the hell could I know of such a great place so close top her flower shop without her not finding it first? I claimed, \"It's just a Maritimer thing\"  Service was 5 Star.  Good job Old Yorke Grill I'll always be back - don't change anything!"}
{"text":"Best Eggs Benedict and hollandaise sauce around. Their house made hot sauce is delicious. After eating here monthly for many years I can say their bunch is consistent, generously portioned and delicious without fail. Try Eggs Britney for a nice change - addition of tomato salsa to traditional Benedict."}
{"text":"Just because something is hidden doesn't mean it's a gem... brunch was pretty sub par. Homefries were soggy, huevos rancheros and eggs benny were bland, and to me, nothing about this is a four star bar."}
{"text":"The Old York has been a perpetual breakfast haunt for my friends and I for years, and we love making the Saturday/Sunday morning trip down to relax on the patio and eat some fantastic food. We started going regularly because they did the best standard breakfast in the city (eggs, toast, home fries and fresh greens) but soon learnt to appreciate the rest of their menu -- eggs benny, the special omelette of the day. The service has never been super fast but for a small place that is typically busy it's understandable -- plus we are never in a rush on a weekend morning. Coffee is so so and it can be a struggle to get that 3rd refill someday's.  On the whole The Old York Bar and Grill ranks as one of the best breakfast joints in the city."}
{"text":"Best restaurant I went to in a series of awesome restaurants during my 4-day trip to Toronto. The lentil tacos with crispy chickpeas were absolutely amazing. I also tried the kimchi rueben, which was great. The vegetarian poutine gets an A for effort and a B+ for taste. My meat-eating friends got the pulled pork poutine and fried chicken and loved it."}
{"text":"Update! The pork production facilities by the Old York have closed. Great news for those of us with sensitives noses.... and for real estate in the area, no doubt."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!   The Old York is a great place for drinks, or for food. It's almost hidden from King Street, which means it's mostly filled with locals and people who appreciate quality service.  The entrees are delicious. The beer selection is very nice. The prices are comparable with any other spot in the area. Mostly, I appreciate the space, both on the inside and on the patio. They went through some renovations a few years ago, and the result is a cleverly designed area that feels comfortable no matter where you're sitting. It can serve as a romantic dinner spot, or as a good place to grab a drink with a couple of friends. I wouldn't recommend taking a large group here.  4 stars"}
{"text":"I was twice here consecutive days. Amazing place with good food and amazing hot pepper sauce. Bought a bottle to take home."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place for a number of reasons. Great location to walk over to after a Toronto FC game and never very busy. Fantastic patio. Hidden sorta location off of King Street. The Burgers are great. I really can't attest to anything else as I always get the Burger with Brie and Mushrooms. Best part is the amazing home made hot sauce. Very spicy. Recommended!!! Never been disappointed with the number of times I've been so far."}
{"text":"The Old York is a nice little neighborhood place in an area where there just aren't a lot of nice little neighborhood places.  An interesting selection of beers on tap, suprisingly good food, friendly staff, and a great patio in the summer make this place my go-to in the neighborhood.  This is a great utility spot - good for quiet beers with pals, a casual dinner (the cuban sandwich is delish) or laid-back sunday bunch.    My only gripe is that the small size can make it difficult to get a seat, although crowds here are inconsistent - on a Saturday night, you never know if you'll be the only one there, or will be left table-less."}
{"text":"OMG. I still remember the salmon and the soup a few years ago, when I lived in the neighbourhood. Excellent cooking in a non pretentious restaurant."}
{"text":"For sure the best spot in the neighborhood for a pint.  The food is also delicious, but I'm still getting used to the new menu so 4 stars instead of 5"}
{"text":"Ambience Old York is nice on the inside. It has a bit of an old school vibe to it, that nice worn in look. The restaurant was clean, the patio (the big draw here) is pretty big for the size of restaurant and the overall feel of the resultant is all low key. I can't help but get a film noir feel out of this place.  Dim light, small tables and a nice bar makes this a good spot for drink dates and late night drinks and snacks (not a meal).   Service I went for dinner with 2 friends on a Saturday evening around 7pm and we sat ourselves right away. The inside was maybe half full and quiet. Our waiter had a stiff upper lip: no small talk, all business which is fine by me but some people might see this as being unfriendly. He wasn't, but he wasn't warm either.  Order was taking promptly, drinks came quick as did the food. Everything was prompt but not in the \"rush you out the door\" way.  Food I live down the road from Old York and this was my first time here. The reason why? The menu isn't that great. A few apps and a few sandwiches. That's it; I can make this at home. I know it's the \"simple menu and be really good at it\" strategy, but works against Old York. Nothing on the menu is exciting: just a small selection of bland continental pubish apps + sandwiches.   The food isn't that great either. One friend and I had the grilled chicken sandwich. Meat was really roasted chicken leg/thigh meat as you'd do at home which was nice but there was very little of it and was substantially over powered by the abundance of mayo and a little soggy red pepper on a unremarkable bun. It was bland, messy, mayo-y, cold and left me dissatisfied.   The other friend had the Cuban sandwich. He said it was bland, over cooked and soggy as well. It didnt look good...  Our sandwiches were on par with a stereotypical bachelor sandwich made just in time to sit down in a living room for a Sunday football game in your underwear. Not worth the price.  This was not home cooked comfort food as other reviews suggest.  The only redeeming quality was the meal came with both salad and fries (both tasted fine).    Verdict I would return to Old York for the atmosphere and drinks but certainly not a meal. Maybe the appetizers might fare better."}
{"text":"I really like the food here but was prompted to write this review due to the terrible service we received this week.  My friend had a problem with her drink and the waiter snapped at her and then persisted to argue with her.  Really, really not acceptable."}
{"text":"Have been here dozens of times, living right near by.  The staff are awesome, service is fast and the food is good.  My favorite items on the menu are the burrito, burger, wrap and club.  I like that it doesn't have a million TVs and although there is music playing, it's pleasant and not too loud.  The surrounding area is definitely going downhill, unless you're an uber yuppy from Liberty Village, I guess, but this bar is more of an exception and provides a nice escape from the growing King West nightmare.  Go to the Old York if you want a conversation in a comfortable and relaxing environment."}
{"text":"Best brunch ever. Best home fries ever. Best hot sauce ever. And it's 5 seconds away from my house. God bless old York!"}
{"text":"Favourite local bar. Great low key atmosphere. Amazing since they changed their menu. Everything is delicious. The fried chicken is a guilty pleasure!"}
{"text":"Liberty Village local pub. We had a long day packing for a move and called to reserve a table, great idea welcomed on arrival later in the evening, made to feel at home just like a local pub should do. Smaller dining room along with decent size patio. Good selection of beer on tap. Staff very friendly and knowledgeable on menu items. Food quality excellent for a pub. I had the burger and it was large, fresh and made on premises. Bun was perfect along with fixings. One of us had ribs, delicious. Fried chicken as well, and had some spice to it. Definitely recommend if in the area. Will return."}
{"text":"The service is absolutely horrible.  Not sure who owns or is managing this place but a smile and apology go a long way when things go wrong.  I can go on and explain the situation but bottom line...there are many other pubs in the area with great service...give this one a miss and save yourself the grief."}
{"text":"This place is exactly in the middle of our thirty minute walk home from work and, now that it's getting a little chillier, the appeal of a warm, cozy pub could be resisted no more, and we went in.  We weren't all that hungry so we ordered the nachos and a pitcher of Wellington. They were both good (the chips were particularly tasty!), but what really won me over was the quaint, cozy atmosphere and our laid-back (but very attentive) server.  We will definitely head back the next time we need a warm break from our wintry walk."}
{"text":"Came across this spot prior to a concert at the Molson Amphitheater and a friend and I were able to seek refuge from the rain while we waited for the gates to open. It's located within walking distance in a cozy residential neighbourhood.   It blends in so well amongst the houses and the trees on the street you almost would walk right by it if it wasn't for the fact it's on the corner.  Once inside this local pub is cute and definitely a fave with the residents in the area. My friend and I opted to stay here for a spell and have a drink and some eats. They had a small selection of beers but some notable craft options included Grasshopper, Wellington, and Mad Tom IPA on tap.  The menu was fairly basic as far as pubs go, and I had a spinach salad with some chicken on it. It did the job and tasted good. Chicken was a touch dry for my taste BUT the salad had a good dressing on it.  We left satisfied and agreed we would return as our future pre-amphitheater go to spot. Once I've had more than the salad I'll be able to upgrade or downgrade this review accordingly  Eatcrest out!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for a brunch place after sailing and since I had passed by this place many a times (and also been told about this by many people), we decided to finally give it a try. We got a table for 4 on their patio that was surprisingly not so busy on a Saturday morning. I'm going to rate it in 3 categories:  Ambience: Located on a quaint little street, this place has a great vibe and a fantastic patio that is filtered away from the craziness of some of the other spots that located on vibrant streets. It's nicely cordoned away and surrounded by houses, and one would never know this exists unless they get lost in that area.  Food: One of my friends started with their omelette that was stuffed with mushroom and feta, extremely delicious. The 2 other friends ordered for the burger, and again no complaints with those. They made sure that the food not only tasted good but also was presented nicely on the plate. Finally, it was the eggs benny with pea meal bacon and red pepper salsa for me. It was simply delicious. To top all of the above with their house made hot sauce made the food even appealing to our taste palettes.   Service: This is the only reason why I did not give it 5 stars. I'm not sure if they were short of staff that morning so I may have to give them a benefit of doubt. But there were times we were just sitting there with no one to attend to us. However, the place has such a nice vibe that one wouldn't mind spending a few extra minutes chilling on the patio and when they do attend to you, it's always with a big smile.  All in all, it's a great place to enjoy the food while sitting out in the sun without all the honking of the cars and the crowds to bother you..."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great crowd. Sat outside in the sun - it got a little hot, but on a sunny day, you have to sit outside. Half in the shade and half in the sun depending on the time of day.  Recommend their Eggs Benny and Eggs Roddy. Egg is cooked to perfection... Yolk is runny but to the perfect consistency. Definitely ask for their hot sauce, it's a must when you come here.  In terms of drinks, they don't have a cocktail menu, but they have a bar with a good variety of liquor and they were able to make the drinks we asked for. Tequila sunrise and Irish coffee to go with your breakfast also a must!  Definitely recommend and would come back."}
{"text":"When I moved into the area I immediately checked out all of the best pubs within stumbling distance of my home. The Old York was definitely a diamond in the rough.   I have taken many a friendly date to this location and am yet to be disappointed. They don't try to be anything more than a small local pub with a quaint feel to it.. ALTHOUGH they were victim to \"Restaurant Makeover\"... they quickly fixed that error in judgement.  They carry a few Ontario wines worth trying and their sweet potato fries are delicious. Don't go in with high expectations and come out satisfied.   The Patio is a must for summer :)"}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service was mediocre. The waiter was rude and very impatient. I had the cuban sandwich; it was kind of spicy (probably the jalapeño), yet delicious!"}
{"text":"Just the most amazing atmosphere you can imagine.  Beautiful people run the place and you can tell they care. The food is amazing. Service is A+++. Try everything! On their menu, you will not be disappointed.  The vibe is exactly what this neighbourhood is all about. As kid friendly as it gets, we love being there as a family."}
{"text":"Nice little spot for an after work drink. Good patio, well priced drinks and very good food. Pretty charming place and much less pretentious than a lot of the other options around here."}
{"text":"It could be easy to miss this place unless you live in the neighbourhood. My best friend and I were taking a short cut on a bike ride and passed a charming little corner patio that looked welcoming and not too packed. We stopped by on our way home and had some wine and beers.   Inside, the atmosphere is a time warp back through almost every decade-- old school bar and tables, photos, old tv's and they always have some great tunes playing. Probably the most laid back atmosphere that could, at any minute, explode into a full blown party depending who shows up.  Service is usually efficient and friendly. Decent beers on tap and cheap bottles of wine. We ordered Nachos one night and they brought us some of the house made hot sauce, that was hot, sweet and delicious.  This is my new neighbourhood stop!!"}
{"text":"Quiet patio tucked away from busy king street.  Great burgers and bar food in general.  Friendly and attentive staff"}
{"text":"The Old York is pretty much the best place in King West.  With no pretentious vibe, this is the kind of place you can go for a laidback evening (or brekky).  The food is great (sammies, fries, burgers, etc.) there's a good selection of quality beers, and super friendly staff who like to engage in amusing banter with customers.  Its a place you'll definitely want to come back to again and again."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my outing at the Old York recently! Having saw that it had fallen prey to the Restaurant Makeover fix, I had some trepidations going in about the service and food. However, once my pal Christine blurted via text 'pulled pork sammy here' those reservations were put aside.   The place is small, dark but unpretentious and the staff are friendly and relaxed. There's a very casual, down at home vibe about and they have a good selection of local beers on tap. I shared the pulled pork with CC and it was not bad! Better than most pub food even some of those corporate faux irish bars about town. The meat was tender but the sauce was timid and there wasn't enough of it. It came in a soft portuguese bun, an appropriate vehicle. I also had a spinach salad on the side that was nothing special but it was a healthy portion and came with sauteed 'shrooms and bits of goat cheese. The standout foodwise were the sweet potato fries-they were huge meaty fingers, hot and fluffy inside and a crispy lightly spiced coating. I'll be back to try these again and again....  What a lovely place to chill out, chow down and gab the night away."}
{"text":"I like this place and since the slaughter house across the street closed down the patio is a nice option in the summer. Craft beer selection and interesting brunch. They have a home made hot sauce that's worth the trip. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Popped in after picking the spouse from the One of a Kind Show.   The wait (15 mins) was ok.  The server brought us a glass of water.    My wife had the eggs benny and I had the breakfast wrap.   There was a wait 20 mins but we had some coffee and chatted with a friend.    My wife loves the eggs benny and the sides of greens and home fries.    The wrap was hot and fresh but I found the wrap just a little too thin.  This is not a hand held wrap.   But the greens and fries were very good.   It was a good meal although when I paid credit card I thought it was a tad forward to see the tip for the meal set at 20%.  Granted you can by pass it for your own but still."}
{"text":"THE hidden gem of the King West 'Hood  - Best bar soundtrack in Toronto (IMHO) - Food is amazing - Don't miss out on the homemade hot sauce - Relatively obscure location means you have a pretty good chance of getting a table, but brunch and weekends are busy"}
{"text":"The old york has been a staple destination for the King St west residents for years. Even before the days popularity in the King West Village, locals from all over would flock there for great live music. It originally opened as a bar for the local meat packers and tradesmen of the area. It now has some what of a trendy vibe to it, but not too trendy where it is overcrowded by weekenders. The bar itself went through the show \"Restaurant Makeover\", but really didn't do too much transforming as the bar still resembles that of a \"dive\". A dive it isn't, great food....burgers, wings, fresh salads, and all the other regular pub fare. The selection of Beer on tap is pretty good. I once had my first Guinness at the Old York, followed by another 6 or 7  many years ago. A great spot for a beer, live music, and finger food."}
{"text":"Love this little neighbourhood place! We have brunch here often and really like the food. Prices are reasonable and food comes quickly usually! In the summer you can sit outside on the patio!"}
{"text":"Cool little bar and grill tucked away in Old York. Was an intimate setting and food was prepared quick  I had a steak sandwich. It was good a pretty filling. No complaints for this place."}
{"text":"Just the patio I've been looking for: delicious sandwiches, homemade fries, fresh salads, cold beer, and a convivial atmosphere."}
{"text":"Always happy to meet up with the Yelpers and share a libation or two.  Thirsty Thursdays this week found us noshing at the Old York Bar & Grill (right next door to the Niagara St. Cafe :).   I'd never been into the bar previously but I have to say I like this place a lot!  It's a great spot to meet up with friends.  Props to our barkeep Sky who shakes up a pretty decent Cosmopolitan.  Hey, a girl likes her cocktails.  I can't drink beer, it's just rented space and makes me fart like a truck driver!  So Sky was quite content to meet my cocktail needs.    Considering this is a bar the food looks half way decent.  I shared a Pulled Pork sandwich with my fellow Yelpie, FARC friend, Deanna.  It was ok.  Could have used a bit more pork and the bun was really soft, not crispy, just soft.    Sort of the way buns get at the end of the day after they've been stored in a plastic bag.  Love the fries and the sweet potato fries.  The OYB&G has one of the most interesting condiments I've tried in a while.  The best way I can describe it would be to call it Jerk Catsup.  At first I thought it was grainy mustard in a bottle but later discovered that it was a jerk styled side for burgers or something to dip those huge wedges of sweet potato fries in to.  It had attitude but not the barn burning type.    Good selection of on tap brewskies and a really laid back atmosphere make this a great little corner spot to hit up.  It also has a patio which seemed to always be full but then again with fall on the doorstep who can blame people for squeezing the last few days of patio enjoyment."}
{"text":"good local pub.  beer menu isn't extensive but it's good.  food is well priced and well made.  staff is friendly, mostly quiet"}
{"text":"I'll put this plain and simple.  I live above a British-style pub with a full menu, a good run of taps, an okay whisky list, and waitresses that wear school-girl short tartan skirts.  And yet, this is not my local.  I go across the street to the Old York where I've been going since even the days before the 'Restaurant Makeover' it went through.  Gone are the booths at the back where I used to play backgammon and in are newly poured floors, a new decorative bar and an antique beer sign above the stage.  There have been changes, but the heart remains the same.  The menu is small and targetted with nothing but fresh ingredients used.  The brunch on the weekends is abundant and tasty and the staff know exacttly how to take care of you.  Any wonder why I go?"}
{"text":"I've never been here for food, but the menu looks good and I've heard some favorable reviews about the chow here.   What I go here for, and what I think is its biggest selling point is the atmosphere and the service. There's not too many legit independent pubs and grills out there anymore but this is one of them.  No frills decor and a simple bar with throw back chairs and benches are the seating options. There's a cool casual patio facing onto Niagara St. Prices are fair and the staff (we were served by Dawn) are all top shelf.  It's a quick stumble home for me and a cool place for getting a few pints.   They are not the fish and chip joint   Check 'em out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Monday night as we were looking to grab a drink on a patio that could accommodate our stroller.  I had passed by the place many times and had always wanted to check it out; I'm glad we finally did.  In addition to our craft pints of beer, we had dinner - my husband the fried chicken and me the bean burrito.  We both really enjoyed our meals; excellent flavour and portion sizes at good price points.  I am not vegetarian, but do opt for non-meat options when out pretty regularly.  Kudos to this place for offering so many excellent-looking vegetarian alternatives.  The service was good, albeit just a touch slow.  But as we were there to enjoy one of the last patio evenings we will probably get this year, we didn't mind.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Came for lunch solo. First time here too. Simple cheese burger and fries. Couple guys came in 8-10min after I ordered and they got their burgers first. Burger was small and dry. Serving of fries was small. But noticed their's were small too. For $15...? The only saving grace was the house made hot sauce. Rather go up the street too Foggy Dew for a dollar or two more for an adequate meal."}
{"text":"Never knew there was a resto but thought it would be cute to check it out. Could be a local gem. Service was very slow. And it wasn't that busy. I had to get our own menus since the server didn't seem to care to service us. Food came out slow too. Average food but how bad can eggs and toast come out. The server knew the service was not good so gave us a slight discount on our bill. This place is probably a local gem but I didn't have a good impression. Too many places to go so they lost my vote in coming back."}
{"text":"5 stars for brunch! This is my #1 brunch spot because:  Classic savory breakfast items Quick service & little to no wait times at brunch The brunch potatoes Their hot sauce   When I'm craving eggs, bacon, potatoes and don't feel like waiting in line somewhere on King where you get a $15 piece of toast with avocado on it, I come to Old York. Good food, no frills"}
{"text":"Every time I agonize between the Vegetarian Mushroom Kimchi Reuben and the veggie poutine with feta. Both super extremely delicious - but unfortunately too large and filling to order both at once. So yeah, bring a friend."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  Amazing brunch, wonderful patio and the BEST hot sauce!"}
{"text":"The best fish n chips in Toronto. I have tried all 3 fishes, halibut, cod n haddock. All good. And beer is very tasty."}
{"text":"Cute place for brunch, everyone was happy with their meals. Hot sauce is made in house, and it's delicious :)"}
{"text":"Know what?  I've only been once, and didn't even try the food.  But I have to rate this highly because it is just the coolest, chillin'est, laid-back kinda bar in the whole world.  They even let ya smoke a pipe on the patio (most places would tell you it's a stinky business and banish you forever).  If it weren't as far away from my home as it is, I'd probably live there.  This is the kind of real, honest, down to earth kinda place that makes a good city a great city."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for breakfast on a Sunday. We live in CityPlace and love that it's a hidden gem, close to Bathurst but far enough to get away from everything. We arrived about 20mins after it opened and within 5mins of us sitting on the patio, it was completely packed.   Love that the coffee comes in personalized mugs!  I got the Eggs Royal with smoked trout and my boyfriend had the Eggs Roddy. We both loved it!!! Perfect amount of food and for an amazing price! Two meals, two coffees and a juice for $40. Definitely coming back here! You guys are awesome! Ps get the hot sauce, it's insane!"}
{"text":"Food taakes a really long time and low capacity. Real mom and pop shop.   Food quality is good though!!  I am only pissed because they cannot handle high volume (we went on saturday afternoon)  Also limited capacity for diners"}
{"text":"After seeing restaurant makeover my gf and I decided to check it out.. When we got there the place was empty. We sat down and waited 10 min before seeing a server. When she finally arrived she said \" I hope your not looking for food\" , wtf .. I said yes. Then she said , \"well the kitchen is switching over and there will be a 30 min wait.\" Huh? How hard is it to fire a few wings in a deep fryer? But I guess they must use special oil that needs to wait 1hr between breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Come here the odd time when my old co-workers are too lazy to walk a few blocks. Good outdoor patio and away from the big crowds. Smells better now too now that the pig factory is gone. Standard beers and food isn't anything to write home about, although their jerk wings on the grill go perfect with a cheap pint of beer!"}
{"text":"Old York is the perfect neighbourhood spot: beer and snacks? Check. Brunch? Check. Good food and not your average pub with yummy homemade hot sauce: yes.  I've had breakfasts filled with eggs Benedict and caesars, to dinners with meals and liquor; all have been enjoyable. Good food, price, location..."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positives: ambiance, location and wings. Now the location could also be a negative because the bar can be a little hard to find, but it's tucked away so romantically. The patio is great and adds to the ambiance of \"quaint\". Everyone seems to know everyone - patrons, workers and neighbours. And that's why I think all these reviews are so positive. Because in reality the food sucked.  The wings were delicious and on par with cost of wings at other restaurants.  The burger (Classic Burger with Havarti) was dry and tasteless.   My sandwich (Old York Roasted Chicken Sandwich) was disgusting, like REALLY disgusting. I dipped the shit out of it in the yummy pepper sauce and I still couldn't finish it. I didn't even know it had brie in it, as the menu states, because it was just all mayo and BOILED chicken. Don't even tell me that chicken was roasted. It wasn't. They were out of the red peppers, so I subbed in mushrooms which were tasteless, just like the caramelized onions. Just imagine a boiled white-on-white-on-white sandwich covered in mayo, because that's what it was.   If I'm to believe all the other reviews, rethink the burger and pull that gross chicken sandwich off. Don't even give me that nasty option.  Because it's so close, I may give this place a chance for a weekend breakfast. But overall, horrible food experience. I was so sad to waste money here.  Oh and this had no bearing on the review, but the menus on your actual website don't work."}
{"text":"Great vibe, great staff and solid craft beer selection. Going for weekend brunch is a particular favourite of ours--the food is fantastic. Old York, among many things, is warm, genuine and a hidden gem only minutes from King St."}
{"text":"This hidden little gem is definitely for the locals in the area.  I come here for brunch on a regular basis and there's rarely a wait, the food is consistently good and i CANNOT get enough of their home made hot sauce (they also sell bottles of it for $8 or 9 if you really can't get enough of it like me).  Their huevos rancheros is delicious and they score points for serving breakfast with home fries, a side of salad and a bit of fruit.  Breakfast burritos and benny's are also really tasty. I know they underwent a reno recently but i wouldn't say it's \"nice\" inside.  It's a pub, if you're looking for somewhere more upscale, i would head to King for that, let's just say if you have bed head, that's completely acceptable here. Another plus is their patio, highly coveted in the summer and worth the wait.  Service is laid back and can take a while if it's busy but i've never had any issues with bad service or servers."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Idea for a casual date to share a pint. Very cute and great for summer."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite sweet potato fries in the city. They're extremely thick cut - think one whole sweet potato sliced lengthwise into maybe four shards - and deliciously spiced with cinnamon, cumin, maybe cloves? They come with sour cream and also be sure to try the homemade jerk seasoning.  Grilled cheese sandwich on focaccia with havarti, brie and aged cheddar and pesto spread is also otherworldly. Who knew I liked pesto?? I certainly didn't.  It's easy to be neglected on the patio and service can be spotty. If you can, try to get the hot, bearded, plaid-shirted server. He's also good for a flirt, so if you're out of practice, he's happy to oblige."}
{"text":"Returned today for brunch and the service was horrid. All the stars I gave are for the food! The food was amazing and the home fries were perfect! Our food took like 40 minutes to come out and  1) we got there at 1p,  2) it wasn't busy and  3) we ordered really simple things aka eggs and bacon and eggs benny.   Nobody checked on us or explained the ridiculous wait time and even to get the bill took and eternity and our played weren't cleared. There were like 3 different people taking care of us and the initial guy who seated us and took our orders who's name was written on our bill as our server was sitting at the bar texting the whole time.   I'm not usually annoying about service but this was a joke and made me wish I had just made breakfast.  Don't think there will be a next time but if there is it will be for the food."}
