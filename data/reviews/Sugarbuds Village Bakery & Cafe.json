{"text":"Ive been past here so many times that today I had to pullover and go in and I am soo happy I did.  I wasen't blown away by their cupcakes though they did look really good, but it was all the fancy cakes they had on display that wowed me. ( It dosent take much somedays). The owners? wife does some amazing work, and it looks like they had done for a cake for the big bang theory because I saw a pic of Sheldon looking at a cake, im guessing she had done. Its really cute, colorful and reasonably priced. It was dead in there other then a dad with his baby. I really enjoyed the house blend coffee, and the cupcake was decent but not amazing. I'll be back just to stare at the cakes, and have coffee."}
{"text":"Servers DO NOT wear gloves when they make sandwiches! All food items in the display case are stale and old. The only thing they have going for them are the fake display cakes, but even that I do not trust!  I will never come to this bakery/cafe ever again!"}
{"text":"I came here on a really cold weekday afternoon, right before the holidays and it was busy! This place seems to be frequented a lot by locals, and it also looks like a popular lunch spot. I am not sure if the reason for this is because there really isn't much else in the area, because I have a hard time thinking that its the quality of products that keep people coming.   The place is really big, in fact there is a store front and also a bigger room full of more stuff in the back. Though they had lots of cookies and pastries on display, I gotta say that most looked pretty sloppy and unappealing. Either way, we decided on a slice of blueberry cake which was mealy, dry and totally disappointing.   I also had a latte, which was nothing worth noting. Meh... I definitely won't be going out of my way to return here again."}
{"text":"I had been craving cupcakes so I decided to check out this bakery, which is not far from my parents house. I went in and bought a cupcake and a ecclair.  Cupcake -  You often here people say that a cupcake is just a \"cross dressing muffin\", or some sort of similar ass-hattery. A cupcake uses cake batter, and is a small cake, hence CUP CAKE. A muffin uses muffin batter, A muffin uses quickbread batter (has no yeast ). A muffin can have frosting, this was not a cupcake, it was a muffin with frosting. Given that fact, it was still pretty decent. The icing was good, not too sugary, pretty good consistency, nice creaminess, the \"cupcake\" wasn't too rich.  Ecclair  I like ecclairs, the biggest problem I see with them is either the chocolat is crappy, or the filling is not good. This one had good chocolat, and good filling. The consistency was good.  Admittedly it is a little confusing when you walk into what used to be the coffee place, and see coffee and have to go into a back room for baked goods. However, the people are nice enough, though a little odd. It's sort of different from what you normally get in bakeries, they are the usual hipster college/high school types, and the people you see they aren't the overtly middle class type. Welcome to Scarborough, you aren't  on Church anymore Toto.   For what it is, and where it is located, the bakery is pretty good. I would go back for more."}
{"text":"If your looking for authentic Italian fresh baked goods, then look no further. The Village bakery has pretty much anything you would find in \"mama's\" kitchen...well maybe more.  They make the most unbelievable lasagna - beef and vegetarian. Which they freeze. The portion size feeds around 6-8 adults. It is worth the $20, and saves you plenty of time! Also pick up a fresh loaf of garlic bread at $3. Its huge, and the 4 cheese ( asiago, parma, cheddar and dolcelatte) makes this absolutely Delicious!  They also carry fresh meats, cheeses and bread. Take a look around the store as they import many Italian brand sauces, cookies and olive oil....you will not find this type of selection in your local grocery shop!  A great place to grab a sandwich, or to stock up on authentic Italian products."}
{"text":"Went there for a late breakfast. Had a few meat products like sheppard's pie and sausage rolls. They did not taste all that good. I would give it a lower rating based on the food but the service is so friendly and the location is very quaint."}
{"text":"Sugarbuds Village Bakery & Cafe seems to be really popular with the local people but I am not really impress...with both the service and the quality of their sweets..   My friend got really confused when she walked in.. seems like this place is divided into a cafe that serves some cookies and pastries and drip coffee in the front.. then the other area has a hot station and more sweet and baked goods at the back.   There is no prices and signage on some of their baked cakes... so we tried to find out what they are.. but even the servers are little confused about what they are and how much they cost. Same with their Macaroons, she not even sure which flavours they are... we have to tell her that that brownish one is cafe... pistachio is the green one.... hmmmm   The display of cakes and sweets are so not interesting and tempting.. even mine will eat anything that is sweet were not excited. Sugarbuds have serious problem here!  Blueberry cake ($2.75)  - the cake based is really dried.. and doughy and chewy..  - tastes like a something I get from the supermarket.. (hmmm and they call those gourmet cake slice?)   Macaroons ($1.25)  - one of the cheapest one I ever got... I wonder if they make it in house... I really doubt that..  - not too fresh! it tasted stale already the next day...  There are hardly any sitting in the cafe area..and they are selling Timothy's brewed coffee... feels like more of a coffee shop style instead of a cafe...   I don't think I will be back again.. I would rather have a cappuccino and tiramisu at Fratelli Village next door!"}
{"text":"Formerly The Village Italian Bakery it has now been bought over by a husband and wife team, moved down the road to the corner of this strip and completely overhauled and remolded. Upon entry you will find your self in there cafe that serves hot beverages, frozen yogurt, and a smaller selection of there baked goods. Walk into the back and you will find yourself in there bakery which does custom cakes, has a selection of hot italian foods and italian desserts, fresh baked breads, cupcakes, pastries, and cookies.  Mind you the new design is completely more modern and eye appealing than the once family run old school bakery it was before, the quality has  however taking a turn for the worst.  For every birthday when we were kids my mom would come here to order us a Vanilla Italian Custard Cake for our Birthdays - layers of moist vanilla cake with a thick delicious italian cream custard layer covered in simple vanilla buttercream with sliced almonds around the sides. It was delicious and we looked forward to it every year. Although they still make these cakes here, I feel its lost the nostalgia that it once had at the old location.  We decided to try the cupcakes here which is something the new owners introduced to the bakery. I have had the red velvet cupcake here many times and they are hit and miss. Once we ordered a batch and they were completely stale and we called the owners and told them and they said bring it back and they would give us a fresh batch (which I really appreciated). The new batch was more tastier, fresh and moist.  As well the chocolate rum balls which we use to get at the old bakery were soo rich and moist great flavour, dense fudgy  centre with subtle rum flavour in a shiny chocolate coating, very addictive. We tried them at the new bakery and the rum flavour was sooo strong and over powering that I couldn't even eat them. We brought them back and she gave us a new batch but it still had a very strong rum flavour not like the old ones. However my father could handle the flavour and still enjoyed the new variety.  Anyways I came back today to give them another shot. This is what I tried:  Red Velvet Cupcake with Cream Cheese Frosting -  Today's batch was not there best, the cake itself was a bit dry but the cream cheese frosting was good. I like that they decorate them according to the season.   Chocolate Fudge Cupcake I didn't really like this, it was just average. I've had much better chocolate cupcakes than this before, the icing was fudgy but the cake itself was lacking and a bit dry.  Rum Ball It was mediocore, edible but still not as good as the ones I'm use too.  Cannolis and Cream Horn My parents tried these, they said it still taste like the original and enjoyed it. One thing I like that they do is they fill the cannoli to order, this keeps the filling fresh and shell crunchy.  Overall this Bakery is really hit or miss. They do have a great selection of baked goods as well hot italian foods. They're custom designed cakes look really good. I suggest if you need a batch of cupcakes, preorder them to guarentee freshness and quality."}
