{"text":"Their coffee is great-better than Starbucks, and the little cakes they have on display are so cute!!! I haven't tried the cakes yet but the breakfast pastries are pretty good and the line moves faster than a lot of the other breakfast places nearby. The people who work there are super friendly and helpful too,  even if they can't answer your question, they'll direct you to someone who can.
 If you come in the morning, there's a dark haired girl who's usually working who is always so energetic and cheerful, it makes me smile. I'm not a morning person but her energy is contagious. 
I just wish there was a bigger seating area, and maybe some paper plates to eat the pastries on if you don't get them to-go."}
{"text":"My lab manager purchased a quarter sheet cake from here yesterday for the boss's birthday.  I had been wanting to try this place since it's so close to my work, but on the other hand, was a bit put off because I suspected they are run by Pitt dining services.  While I'm not sure whether this is true or not, the fact of the matter is that I was less than impressed by the taste of the cake that we had yesterday.

The decoration on the cake looked nice, if a bit rote, so I was hopeful that it would be a decent cake.  However, as soon as I bit into a piece, I was instantly disappointed.  While the cake itself was okay (though certainly not great), the icing was utterly flavorless.  It was that buttercream impostor \"bettercream,\" which is used routinely on grocery store cakes, and lacks the richness of true buttercream.  Rather than being made with butter--or even margarine (yuck)--I suspect it was made with something like Crisco as its fat base (double yuck).  I barely finished the small-ish corner piece that I'd chosen, and didn't go back for seconds.

I'm sorry to be harsh, but as the reigning PGH Bakery Queen, I've tried sweets from 2/3-3/4 of the bakeries in PGH, and this one is my least favorite.  Sadly, the fact of the matter is that I've had better cakes from Giant Eagle.  I strongly suggest that the owners consider changing their cake icing recipe to a more traditional buttercream, like every other bakery in PGH I've tried.  I've seen some decent looking sandwiches in the display case as I've walked by, so perhaps they're better.  I'd be willing to give them a try, but I won't be purchasing any baked goods from here unless the owners reformulate their recipes."}
{"text":"The chocolate croissant was really delicious, the only problem with this place is that it doesn't have a good inside sitting area and no outside, it's just better for pick up!"}
{"text":"This place impressed me! I was not expecting such great desserts! The interior of this bakery/market is a little odd, but the death by chocolate cupcake and chocolate cookies were some of the best I've ever had. I'm worried I might have become addicted. I look forward to trying their cakes later!"}
{"text":"The store is so cute!!!!! + Cheese croissant is highly recommended. It is the best among the croissants that I have had until now. 

I forgot to take photos... Maybe I was fully occupied by eating my croissant. Anyway I'm happy to find it."}
{"text":"I've only gotten the almond croissant here, but it is delicious! For $1.99, the croissant is pretty big and is sweet and fluffy. I 10/10 recommend the almond croissant and I'll be back to try other bakery items."}
