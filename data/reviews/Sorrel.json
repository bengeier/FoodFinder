{"text":"Great restaurant!

The menu seemed to be a mix of italian and french foods.

We each started with a glass of Pinot Grigio and the fig, prosciutto, goat cheese tapas to share.  The presentation was very nice.  There were 3 morsels on a bed of arugula and balsamic glaze.  The taste was amazing!  A combination of sweet, salty, creamy, and zesty.  I would definitely recommend this appetizer.

For our mains, my girlfriend had the cornish hen wrapped in prosciutto with vegetables and garlic mash.  Again, it did not fail the tastometer!  It was fantastic and cooked perfectly.  It was a tad salty, but that's because the prosciutto infused into the hen.
I was in the mood for a pasta since I rarely eat pasta, so I ordered the seafood linguini in a white wine sauce.  It was okay.  It had lots of variety of seafood - calamari, octopus, cozze, shrimp, I think it had some fish in there too.  The sauce had a nice light flavour too, not too overbearing.

We chose not to order a dessert, as we were both stuffed.

There was a pleasant ambiance and the decor was nice too.

Overall, we were very satisfied with Sorrel.

{"text":"Our friends brought us here for dinner on a Friday evening.  They had their first meal here earlier in the week and were excited to share their experience.  They had made a reservation several days prior and had confirmed the reservation the same day (we wanted the one table for 4 on the patio - which we were assured would be ours).  When we arrived on time (6:30) the table was clearly occupied and it looked as though the people seated had only arrived moments ago.  Half an hour later and despite being reassured they were \"almost done\" they instead set up a 2 person table essentially on the sidewalk and sat us there.  It looked to me that the other party was good friends with the owner (manager?) and were given special treatment despite us having made a reservation there.  We were not pleased - 2 STARS (and only because we could see that the waitstaff were trying hard to figure it out).

Food wise - ok.  My husband and I had the summerlicious menu and the other two in our party did not.  The summerlicious caprese salad was wonderful; soup was somewhat lacking in depth of flavour.  Our entrees: cornish hen very moist but a bit over salted; salmon was flavorful but a bit dry.  Our friend who had the seafood pasta said the seafood wasn't particularly fresh. Creme brulee however was beautiful - creamy, rich, not too runny.... heavenly; bread pudding was not memorable.  Food summary 3 stars.

Service was quite lovely - lots of waitstaff who were friendly, attentive to detail but not overly intrusive.

Overall I can only give 3 stars given the poor experience with our table and the variable food experience (although I can appreciate some of this is subjective)."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a restaurant in the neighbourhood.  The brunches on sunday are absolutely fantastic and priced about the same as any place on Queen West would be, the only difference being that the food here is superior.
For example the Salad Nicoise is made with a fresh tuna steak grilled to perfection with a lovely salad and green beans garnished with plenty of olives and a lovely poached egg !!! 
Even the marmalade they have here is fantastic. I hope too many people don't find out about this secret place coz it makes other establishments I have been to for brunch look total crap."}
{"text":"As one would expect from a Rosedale eatery... everything is impeccable: great location, excellent service, the menu (surprisingly rich for a relatively small place!) fully representative for \"Mediterranean\", with dishes specific for each category (pasta, fish, meat...). We go there regularly (every 2-3 weeks), usually with a couple of friends and were never disappointed. While not opulent, the prices reflect the quality. Convenient parking is available right across the road (at the BeerStore). Slight drawback: since the (many) tables are rather close to each other, sometimes (depending on the mood and voices of the patrons around) the noise level tends to slide above average. Well... quite OK for a convivial atmosphere, but not exactly ideal for a romantic tête-à-tête dinner! But don't miss the $1 oysters starting @ 4:00 PM... a real deal!"}
{"text":"I just love this place, I've been twice and can't wait to go back. Each time I've been there I've had the Prix Fixe menu for lunch and it was amazing. I must also add that the crème brûlée is fabulous. Good place for a business lunch."}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment numerous times. My girlfriend and I ordered the $1 each oysters. We both ordered two plates. The waitress informed us that we needed to purchase more items. She was extraordinarily rude but I didn't feel comfortable getting into an altercation. I ordered more than I wanted. My daughter then called up the next day to speak to sara, the manager, who turned out was the waitress that served us to state that the service was abominable. Even after leaving a tip sara continued to treat us poorly and never thanked us. When my daughter called to discuss the situation and tell her that is was unreasonable to expect people to purchase more meals and drinks other than oysters, she was dismissive and believed customers should since \" the restaurant doesn't make money with selling oysters alone\". My daughter suggested that this be clearly stated on the menu and the website that in order to have the $1 each oysters additional entrees need to be purchased. Sara hesitantly agreed that she will do so but certainly didn't think it was imperative. We will all choose to not go back since we were pressured into purchasing way more than we wanted and were not treated kindly."}
{"text":"Sorrel offers a combination of French Bistro food - steak tartare, duck confit, seared scallops - and Italian bistro fare with a selection of different pastas.  There are also daily specials which on our visit included seared Quebec foie gras appetizer and 2 different grilled fish.  All sounded interesting.  I would have been even more interested if the waiter had quoted us the prices.  But he did not.  I find it very annoying when a restaurant makes you ask the price of specials.  They know full well people are uncomfortable having to ask.  Having been stuck before for specials where I didn't ask the price I either ask or forgo the specials.  In this case none of our party of 4 went with the specials.  We had Malpeque oysters as an appetizer.  Well priced at $1 per oyster.  But they were strangely mushy in texture.  As opposed to fresh grated horseradish they provide pickled horseradish.  2 of us had Duck confit which was very good.  One had seared scallops.  Also very good.  One had pasta with a tomato sauce which rated a good.  Bread pudding for dessert was nothing remarkable.  The wine list is unimaginative with an average 300% mark up.  They do not allow you to bring wine and pay corkage.  

Sorrel is a relatively new addition to the Rosedale restaurant scene opening a few months ago in the former site of Pastis, a longtime Rosedale favourite.  Sorrel was packed on a recent Saturday night during Winterlicious.  But it was not participating in Winterlicious and this was not a Winterlicious crowd.  It is clearly a new favourite with the monied 65+ Rosedale crowd.  There's nothing trendy about the decor.  It's pretty basic and unimaginative.  They have crammed every available square inch with tables which results in some rather unfortunate table locations and tables too close together.  As a result, depending on where you sit, you can have people constantly bumping you as they squeeze by.  In our case, there was a constant stream of traffic passing us to either the kitchen, the washrooms or the coat check.  Waiters and busboys were constantly dropping cutlery or plates as they squeezed past.  My wife and friend were constantly being hit in the head with coats or large handbags as they were brought to or from the coat rack.  I focus on the atmosphere and the room because they illustrate what I feel is wrong with Sorrel.  The food was good.  The service was good.  But the room and the atmosphere are poor.  In terms of pricing, Sorrel is competing with the likes of Scaramouche Pasta Bar and Pangaea and many, many others.  Similar menus.  Similar pricing.  Much better rooms.  Much better atmosphere.  Some of them also charge 300% mark-up on wines.  But most allow you to pay corkage.  Bottom line is that we had no complaint about the meal.  But dining is far more than just the meal.  The dining experience at Sorrel was not very pleasant.  I recommend trying the Pasta Bar or Pangaea."}
{"text":"I like their food and decoration, even though it's on a basement. 
I don't like their salads, but the soup is ok. I love their main courses; the desserts are way too sweet for me, but my partner loves the desserts, so overall, the food is good.
The price is good in this neighbourhood, and I will come back with more friends."}
{"text":"Une excellente trouvaille lors de notre périple Winterlicious. Les plats étaient copieux, d'une grande qualité et riches en saveurs : pâtes aux champignons avec truffes, saumon, côte de boeuf ... Malgré un petit hic avec le saumon, que nous avons signalé (trop cuit), ce plat fut immédiatement remplacé à notre plus grand plaisir. Le service était excellent : modéré, présent, efficace sans être trop familier. En sus : un service à la française, c'est à dire aucun retrait des plats tant que chaque convive n'ait terminé. 

Bravo, cette proposition Winterlicious fut une réussite, nous reviendrons pour le menu régulier !"}
{"text":"(4.5 stars)

I went here for summerlicious. We had an early seating, so it was quiet -- only 1 other table in there when we arrived. More people began to arrive once we got our starters. I found that most people were there to order a la carte. 

To start, I ordered the caprese salad. It was excellent. The tomato tasted super fresh and they served a generous amount of buffalo mozzarella. For my entree, I ordered the steak and frites. I asked for my steak medium rare, but it came out medium well. I didn't complain, but that's why it doesn't get 5 stars from me. Overall the steak was great, but I would have preferred it to be a bit more pink inside. The fries were nice as well, but a little too salty. For dessert, I ordered the creme brulee. It was absolutely fantastic. Super creamy and smooth. I would go back just for that. I really enjoyed my meal here and would love to return again some day.

The atmosphere was nice, even thought it's in a basement, it felt like I was dining in someone's wine cellar. It's good for dates and friends."}
{"text":"Ate here last summer with my boyfriend for brunch. It wasn't the best food ever but I did expect better for it being in yorkville and the prices"}
{"text":"Sorrel was so amazing that I couldn't believe that there wasn't a line stretching all the way down the block and back to get into this place!  Maybe it's the unassuming location located on the lower level of a building.  Maybe it's the understated signage.  But whatever the reason- you are missing out if you haven't ventured into this place!!

I arrived on time for my reservation but rather than sit at one of the cute tables situated about- I chose to sit at the bar in the back based on the recommendation of Sarah who met me and the door and immediately made me feel right at home.

I started with a perfectly poured martini while I perused the menu to see just what I was going to indulge in that night.  One of the fun things about sitting at the bar is being able to talk to those around me and on this night- turns out Sorrel was having live music so I was surrounded by the Erroll Fisher blues band that was going to play that night.

After hearing about the specials from Sarah- I decided to go with her suggestions.  First up?  An amazing prosciutto wrapped fig stuffed with goats cheese.  Perfectly plated- this was an amazing start to my night.  And paired with one of the half bottles of wine that they sell- I was in a great place!

My next course was a grilled octopus.  Also perfectly done it was during this second course that the band started to play.  I couldn't believe every table wasn't filled given the high quality of food, superior service and the great music that was coming from the band.

My main course was a fish special of the day that was amazing as well.  I really could not have asked for any part of my evening to go any better.

And just when I thought it was time to leave- some locals walked in, immediately \"adopted\" me as a friend and we ended up actually dancing between the tables in the restaurant!  Now when does fun like that just happen?  It happens because of the kind of place Sorrel is- a friendly, neighborhood place that serves amazing food, with servers who care about doing it right.

I don't know about you but that's just my kind of place.  You can bet I will be back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Toronto may have moved locations, but they took as good of care of me in this new location as they used to when they were on Yorkville.

We had reservations for a busy Friday night at 9pm.  This place was hopping so it took a little while to clear our table which was no problem as they were quick to buy my group a drink and squeeze us into a little space at the bar.

We finally did get a table for 5 in the middle of the dining room and our server was over in a flash to fill us in the that day's specials as well as to take our appetizer order.  I wish I could remember his name as he was really terrific and I know given we were his last table of the night, he had to be tired but you would never have known it.

He steered us toward the ceviche, octopus and steak tartar as well as the oysters of the day.  All were delicious and came out timed perfectly.  For our entrees, we had a range of items from the steak of the day to my \"fried chicken\" which the server had suggested and was a warm honey goodness that still has be licking my lips about.

And then for dessert, the bread pudding was my favorite although the group liked the chocolate torte as well.  Prices for drinks and dinner ran about $100 a person which was totally reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food served.

I was thrilled my friends liked this place as much as I do as that is always a risk when you are the one suggesting a place.

Always at the top of my list to visit when I head to Toronto, Sorrel holds a special place in my heart.  You don't find many places that do things so right with consistency.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Wandered around Yorkville on a cool, overcast Friday, trying to find somewhere not too expensive for lunch, but not a pub.  Glad we chose this.  

In the basement level of the restaurant & shop strip....

Modern, simplistic, bright, clean atmosphere.  Only 2 or 3 tables occupied out of the maybe 20 there?  I found this concerning at first, since you'd expect there to be a busy lunch crowd.  But I think the colder day may have kept a lot of people at the office.  

Attentive and very good service.

Yummy 'head of romaine' Caesar - without bacon, but satisfying large shreds of cheese and thin paper-like crisps.  Yet for some reason it does not show on the online menu?

Great garanelli pasta (veg option).  Decent portion size (not to big, not too small).
  
Delicious 10 oz flat iron steak with fries.
  
Very good asparagus on the side.

Really wanted to try a dessert but was too full.

Absolutely would go back...maybe in the evening next time."}

{"text":"First of all, 5 stars just for experience. It's a small space and you'll sit at a table cramped quite close to another but you'll still feel like you have your own little bubble to enjoy, relax, eat, and talk in peace. I think the service is to thank for this. The service was exceptional. Though this place is expensive and I am by no means close to the age group or earner group that filled all the other tables, I was still treated with such respect and an eagerness to serve. The owner or manager sat us at the bar right away as they prepared our table, everyone worked together to make sure we had drinks and bread, and our waitress was the best, attentive to cues and very upbeat. Now for the food, also a 5! We got a couple dollar oysters, I'm not a huge fan of oysters but these were pretty good. Good texture, strong horseradish. Then we got the steak tartar to start. I've had many of these as beef tartar and carpaccio are some of my favourite dishes. This one wasn't the best I've ever had, but still very good. The aioli style sauce was creamy and good as were the bread and chips that came with it (getting both vessel options is always a plus!) For my main I got the lobster ravioli. This was so, so delicious. The broth or sauce was very light but incredibly flavourful. The pasta was fresh and soft, and the lobster fill wasn't overbearing. For dessert we got the bread pudding. Not the best I've ever had (the Queen & Beaver still takes the cake here), but it was tasty. Though the flavour wasn't as bold and caramely as I'd like, it was light and enjoyable."}
{"text":"I was here for the weekend brunch on a Sunday. 
I arrived around 12.30p and the place was completely empty; maybe people in Toronto dine later? 

I got the french toast, which was good, but not my most fantastic brunch experience. 

Cute ambience and good service. Perhaps better for dinner?"}
{"text":"I'm not surprised this place was packed on Friday evening, the quality of the food, the attention of the service, and the ambience were all first rate.

We had to sit at the bar because all the tables had already been reserved, yet, this was perfectly comfortable; the attention to detail and service by Ryan, the barman, was outstanding.

The grilled artichoke on arugula were unusual and well worth trying. The chicken livers had a crispy edge to them and crunched nicely, complemented by the balsamic and Apple. The buttermilk chicken was excellent even if slightly overdone. The veal was of a high standard but not exceptional.

We drank the good Sancerre and had a very good Nuits St. George, both of which were in the standard price range for these wines. ($ 75 & $120)

The only drawback, like Pastis before it, was at the ambient noise level was high. It was sometimes hard to hear what the other person was saying.

Certainly recommended to try."}
{"text":"Walk past this place and chances are, you probably will not notice it. This intimate, underground restaurant is a real gem in Yorkville and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here. 

The ambience is beautiful and it's a really great date place to enjoy a delicious meal.

The bread was delicious.I had the roasted chicken with asparagus salad and it was very well seasoned and juicy. The asparagus salad was fresh and complemented the chicken wonderfully. For dessert, I opted for the crème brûlée and it was a great choice, as it was smooth and creamy.

Service was attentive and professional. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Happened upon the restaurant completely by accident. The address is new but the restaurant itself is a Yorkville institution that was forced to move after a fire.

{"text":"I went here for lunch a few weeks ago during TIFF.
It was totally dead and I had low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised.

Grilled baby octopus salad, tomato cilantro relish: the octopus was lightly grilled to a point where it was still quite moist and tender; the relish provided refreshing contrast.

Steak frites, 10 oz flat iron, sautéed wild mushrooms: tender and cooked precisely to medium-rare as requested; in a flavorful jus reduction. Mushrooms were a variety of different types, and not overcooked, thus providing some nice textures.

Given that it was lunch, I didn't sample quite as much of the menu as I might have at dinner, but I was pleased with what I had."}
{"text":"This is one of Toronto's restaurant bargains: everyday oysters at $1 per. We do 18 Malpeques  with two glasses of wine and a shared chocolate torte, sit at the bar, and luxuriate inexpensively.
  When we want a full dinner, Sorrel is also excellent, if noisy."}
{"text":"We celebrated a friend's/coworker's birthday here as a large group. While the service was timed to luxuriate with one's company and with each course, the pace could have stood to been picked up a bit.  We were there for a full 3-4 hours. Everything, from drinks to appetizers to desserts, was exquisite and incredible. I shared a prosciutto-wrapped melon appetizer and it was melt-in-your-mouth amazing. I wanted to order the venison rack special, but they ran out of it by 8:00 pm (?!). Instead, I ordered the lamb shank entrée and it was succulent and flavourful. I sampled the scallop ceviche, which was divine with cilantro and lime. Shared the bread pudding with caramel sauce for dessert and I wanted to horde the entire portion for myself. It was warm bliss on a plate. If I wasn't at a fancy place, I'd have loved to lick the plate clean.

Pricey, but well worth it. I'd go back for an occasion in a heartbeat!"}

{"text":"This is a 3.5 star review. (the 0.5 extra star is because i really appreciate atmosphere which this place had). This place used to be in yorkville, though this is the first time eating with them. The place is beautiful - an impressive place to bring people to - it has a formal look with comfortable feel to it.. with a heavy background noise from chatter at peak dinnertime. Crowd mostly older canadians, dressed to impress. Servers are dressed professionally, tablecloths are white, decor/design is impressive for such a small and intimate space. You can see the whole restaurant from most seats. Menu is varied and interesting enough. Service was friendly and responsive. Kitchen was super slow (took long to receive entrees but food was hot). I got hangry between apps and entrees. Duck confit meat was dry, meat was left on the plate. Truffle mash tasted like a few drops of truffle oil (did not see any bits of truffle) were mixed into a too-large serving of mash and the flavour was sporadic and faint (incomparison to regular mash that I also tasted). Truffle honey was nice.. if you take the truffle bits and specifically place them on whatever youre eating, you taste a nice strong flavour. But overall these 2 truffle items were underwhelming.. the truffle taste and the super sweet honey taste wasn't my fav. The truffle aioli on the other hand tasted delish (came on the side with the steak tartare). Steak tartare was nice and oniony, really good flavour - came with some hard (too thick imo) pieces of bread and some chips and the aioli). The quail egg yolk was very free of any white. Fried chicken skin wasn't crispy enough.. when you touch it with your fork the skin kinda folds/breaks/slides off the meat. The chiliean bass was very salty though the skin was beautifully crisp and texture of the meat done just right. The greens for our entrees were not creative in flavouring nor variety. Reminded me of classic asian veges because they were all done with garlic and so that the texture was soft. Lattes are yummy with much froth and a nice tall glass. There was the biggest inorganic strawberry on our cheese plate. Cheese selection was a total of 4 varieties. Dining experience was fine, but would not return nor recommend particularly."}
{"text":"I was researching good spots for brunch for Mother's Day and came across this place. 
The place wasn't packed which was nice for conversations so it wasn't too loud. 
We were seated quickly - and the waiter was so friendly.

Mom's get complimentary champagne and dad and I had our wine. 
I ordered the Lobster Benedict which was so tasty and rich (See picture I posted).
Parents both had omelettes which they enjoyed as well which came with bread and fruit. 

The only thing I noticed was the table next to us has to same waiter as us. 
The lady asked what a Benedict Florentine was and he replied \"Keep reading the menu and it will tell you what it is.\"   The lady didn't take kindly to this comment and he basically got stink eye.  If you want a nice tip buddy just enlighten her and explain what it is.   Maybe it was the french attitude? 

I would defintely try this place again.  Great hot spot for Brunch! 

Give it a try."}
{"text":"VIBE 
For a Saturday night dinner in February, I thought the restaurant would be one that was low key and great for conversation. We're in Yorkville, after all. Au contraire. The restaurant was packed with the Yorkville milieu and on top of it, there was live jazz. Live jazz is always a pleasant surprise unless you're in a subterranean restaurant where the jazz singer (whose name I won't mention but initials were loud and proud on his lapel) was literally table side. (We were sat near the door and scoffed when asked to be moved). I'm not sure why he didn't decide to sit on our table - he felt it was more than okay to put his glass on our table. As we practically had to yell to hear each other, he decided to give us a visit and tell us that he could hear every word we were saying and to keep it down. The clientele was the kind that deserves to have a drink while they're waiting for their table. 

Staff was stop and start. You'll get treated better and faster if you order a bottle of wine. 

WE ATE/DRANK 
We started with the scallop ceviche (served on lettuce) and grilled calamari. The calamari was burnt; the scallop ceviche was a disappointment. I'd say skip the apps and go for more mains to share (depending on how hungry you are). 

The lobster ravioli was our favourite dish of the night - tender and served with a creamy sauce which was promptly scooped up with our bread. 

The halibut was also a good choice - it was flaky but was grilled a bit too hard on the outset. I love rapini but I didn't need the vegetable to cover the whole plate as opposed to acting as an accompaniment. 

We gobbled it down with a Grason Cellar Cabernet Sauvignon. It was a good choice of wine to deal with our initialed friend. 

We decided to try dessert elsewhere. 
Is it just me or is it bad for the server to ask if you want a glass of wine after you've had a bottle? Holy upsell! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
For Yorkville standards, I've had better. Maybe this place would be better at lunch or on a weekday but I won't come here on a Saturday. SORR-y."}
{"text":"A nicely appointed cozy dining room with pleasant efficient service .Although the menu was reasonably priced the food proved to be mediocre with the exception of the bargain priced oysters.I find the concept of a mandatory tip to be offensive and in this instance the choices were 20% and other and so I was compelled to choose other"}
{"text":"\"Excellent!\"  What else is there to say?  $1 oysters and $40 Pinot Grigio in Rosedale?!?  Say no more really.  The service was excellent and the mains divine.  We will be back."}
{"text":"After quite positive past experiences, we returned to find it a pretentious, super expensive, most unpleasant place! Unless you are one of their \"Rosedale regulars\" don't expect a courteous, respectful treatment. I made my (birthday) reservation 3 weeks in advance, clearly requesting a CLOSE TO WINDOW table for two, THAT WAS PROMISED TO ME. Upon arrival we were lead to the absolutely worst table on the floor, in a back, dark corner, while there were still not one, not two, but three 2-seat tables close to the window available. At my protestations the maitre d' (or owner?) rudely dismissed me, pretending that those tables were reserved for parties of 4. According to elementary math 3 tables of 2 persons each would seat at least 6, right? The arrogance was obvious and hurtful. We (with my wife of 38 years) stood up and left the establishment. It may be a Rosedale location, but don't expect the slightest touch of elegance or class!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Sorrel during summerlicious. We had a reservation for Friday night but couldn't go because of the storm and the restaurant had no problem changing our reservation to the Sunday, which was very appreciated. Sorrel doesn't have its own parking but there are paid spots on some nearby streets, there are also a variety of lots within walking distance and if you're lucky you can also find some free parking on Hazelton Ave. They have about 4 tables outside on a tiny patio that faces the street. The main restaurant is not very big and is below street level so getting one of the tables near the windows will make the outing more enjoyable. Our servers were very nice even though there were only two of them looking after 10 tables. The salmon with sautéed rapini on the side was average and overpriced at $27 on the regular menu. The pasta dish (tagliatelle, wild mushrooms, black truffles, shaved parmigiano) was very good. There was nothing special about the steak and fries dishes. The desserts, however, were all DELICIOUS; we had the crème brûlée, bread pudding & tiramisu. They have some appetizing things on the menu that I would like to try but the prices overall are high so I don't think I'd go back unless it was for a prix fixe menu."}
{"text":"Love this place, service and food fantastic!  Never been for dinner but work in the area and come for lunch a lot.  It can get noisy when it's full but that's life in the big city.  They are temporarily closed due to a fire.  Really hoping they open again soon!"}
{"text":"As part of our teambuilding day at work, we went to Sorrel Restaurant for Summerlicious, situated in the heart of Yorkville. 

In spite of its basement location, there was still ample amount of sunlight that poured into the dining area. In fact, the room was quite spacious. The décor was elegant and classy, and I imagine that the restaurant would transform into an intimate, candle-lit space in the evening.

The complimentary warm baguette was absolutely delicious- super soft in the inside! Honestly, serve me some good bread and I'm already a happy diner!

We also ordered a large pitcher of red sangria to share ($36)- wine, orange, lemon, fresh juices, berries, triple sec, and mint. Despite the abundance of fruits in the jug and in our glass, the actual cocktail was not fruity enough for my liking. I had a strong temptation to take a fork and mash up all the fruits! 

One option was a chilled gazpacho soup, a perfectly refreshing choice for a sweltering summer day. I'm not a huge fan of gazpachos in general, so I won't comment a lot about it. This one was particular chunky, to the point that I could scoop it up with my fork.

I opted for the caprese salad with basil pesto and extra virgin oil. The pesto was really tasty, though I wished that the cheese was creamier.

The first entree was seared tilapia fillet on a bed of sautéed french beans, topped with a citrus salseta. When the plate arrived at the table, I immediately had dish envy. The fish was cooked nicely with a beautiful sear, and the bright citrus topping added a tangy punch. 

The vegetarian option was a garganelli pasta with san marzano tomato sauce, bufala mozzarella, and basil. The pasta, cooked al dente, was not bad at all.

I ordered the chicken milanese with shallot parsley butter, fingerling potatoes and wilted spinach. On the whole, I really enjoyed my chicken cutlet. The meat was not the most tender of cuts, but the breaded crust was absolutely scrumptious. 

For desserts, one of the options was a simple dark chocolate mousse and fresh berries. I didn't try any of this but the presentation was very pretty.

I can never resist a good vanilla bean crème brulee, and this was certainly one of the best I've had. Underneath the expertly bruleed top was the creamiest, most delectable custard. I'd be happy to eat three of these for lunch and nothing else!

The last dessert option was an apple strudel. I did get to sample a little piece of the strudel, and I didn't like that it was served cold. The bottom was also slightly burned. I thought that the creme brulee was the better choice.

On the whole, it was a very enjoyable meal. The food was fantastic, the portions were good, and the creme brulee is a strong contender to make my top 10 desserts of the year! I'm very glad that my co-workers picked this place for our team lunch, and I would highly recommend the restaurant for Summerlicious!"}
{"text":"Went there for winterlicious tonight with my husband and another couple. The decor was nice, modern, upscale looking. We sat at a corner table close to the windows. 

I ordered the caprese salad for the appetizer, tagliatelle with wild mushrooms for main and creme brulee for dessert. I also had a martini called \"French kiss\" which I really enjoyed. The salad was nice enough, although I expected some basil which was missing. The main was a little bland and the pasta felt a little dry. I had high expectations from the creme brulee based on the other reviews and I was sorely dissapointed. It seemed like they had torched the sugar a while ago and the caramel was soggy by the time I ate it. The custard was average too. 

My husband ordered the soup for an appetizer and said it was bland, and he said the caramel bread pudding was the best part of the meal. My friend ordered tiramisu which she was raving about.

My husband ate a bowl of cereal after coming home... the portions weren't large enough for him, although they were fine for me.

The service was nice, waters were refilled promptly, food was brought out quickly (almost too quickly maybe to ensure we were out till the next seating).

Overall I'd say the meal was not memorable. Another winterlicious dissapointment for me."}
