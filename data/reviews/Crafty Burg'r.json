{"text":"Great Burger and atmosphere!  Friendly staff and impressive beer list.  Two huge TV's at the bar for great sports watching."}
{"text":"This place definitely has the three b's down: Burgers, beer cheese mac, and bread pudding. I ordered the Good Egg Burger (grilled onions, cheddar, bacon, and a fried egg....comes with mayo but I subbed in red pepper mayo). This is definitely one of the best burgers that I have had in recent years, and certainly rivals Burger Republic (see review). If you get any side, make sure you get some bread pudding. It is mind-blowingly good. They did the right thing by not ruining it with raisins. 

In addition to the great food they also have a great selection of bourbon and beers (on tap and bottled). Service was also stellar. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great location, poor service and food. I checked this place out this evening and we waited 30 minutes to get our food. Normally waiting does not bother me but the food did not make it worth the wait. Maybe they were having a bad night but it did not make me want to try for a second time. Go and check the place out for yourself and be the judge."}
{"text":"Best, best, best burger ever! This place is so cool and the food is beyond awesome! Give it a try! Also the mac and cheese to die for!"}
{"text":"Cool Place. So far only been once in the new Antiquity location. I got the original cheeseburger with 2 sides.  I picked mac n cheese and onion rings. The mac was just ok and the onion rings were just ok too"}
{"text":"Went in at around 3. As a person that's in the industry, I know that's not a busy time for many restaurants. There was only one table in the restaurant when we walked in. Took our server a while to take our drink order. When she took it, she didn't introduce herself or greet us properly, just asked \"what can I get you?\" She honestly startled my friend and I; then she asked \"what do you want?\" referring to our food order. When the food came out, she slapped the trays on our table and walked away. She checked up on us once. The person I was with is also in the industry so we know how things work. Usually even if the service was okay, we still give a 20% tip, not in this case though. Our server was an older lady. She never introduced herself so I can't give a name. Food was okay, but service was dreadful. She made absolutely no effort. Not going back."}
{"text":"Finding a place to eat around the Lake Norman area on a Saturday night is usually such a struggle, but we tried Crafty Burg'r for the first time this past weekend were very impressed! We were seated very quickly, our food came out fast, and the food was tremendous! We were in and out in about 30 minutes, which definitely wasn't expected at a sit-down place in this area. We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Good burger, good value but it's not quite \"there\" yet. The food could be a little more creative and fresh. The burgers weren't \"wow\" like you would expect from a place that specializes in them but they are still good. The sides are clearly made en masse in advance and the overall experience suffers for it. If you don't want to pay $14 for a burger at Bad Daddys down the street then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Extensive beer selection! Awesome music and atmosphere! It is a hidden gem in Cornelius. Not much of a wait here and patio seating too! Great location for coming off the lake!"}
{"text":"We were out of towner's looking for a burger. This place blew us away! Between my family, we tried the bacon jam burger, patty melt, classic burger, onion rings, fries, apple slaw and mac n cheese. Everything was perfect. I wasn't sure what to expect from the apple slaw and it was delicious. Good selection of wine and beer and a nice casual atmosphere - also outdoor seating which welcomes dogs. I wish we lived closer just so we could come here more often!"}
{"text":"Great, flavorful burgers. Nice atmosphere. Good selection. We enjoyed our meal very much. Not too keen on the take-out. Dine in was excellent,though."}
{"text":"Second visit here was even better than the first. The fried mushrooms were excellent and a huge portion. Orders the Good Eye, perfectly cooked. Wife had a plain burger also perfectly cooked. The Crafty beans are a great choice"}
{"text":"Great laid back atmosphere, great prices, great food too! Great alternative to Bad Daddy's though I can see where I would seek out Crafty Burgers on certain occassions and go to Bad Daddy's on other occassions. You get two sides instead of one and if you want a monster burger you can create one. If you don't want your meal to be only about the burger then this place is perfect. Their fried chicken salad is awesome too!"}
{"text":"I previously reviewed the Crafty Burg'r in Huntersville, and I believe I gave it a 1-star. So far this Crafy Burg'r's burgers are far better! I typically get food to go, and their to-go process is a little difficult, as there is always workers trying to do their job in the very place they have to place your order - so you always feel in the way, or cramped. But, at least the burgers are good. I also had the bread pudding, which was delicious."}
{"text":"I am only going to review the burger. I didn't sit down to enjoy a burger and a beer, so I have no comment about the beer or the waitstaff - except that they got my order wrong. I ordered a \"Crafty Burger\", the standard lettuce, tomato, onions, and added mayo - to go. I had heard some good things about this place, and I'm burger obsessed, so I wanted to give it a try. When I got home and opened up the box, I audibly gasped, \"What?!\" First, the burger only had mayo, sans the lettuce, tomato, and onions. But when you think a place is going to give you a special burger experience, you're naturally shocked to face what amounts to a Sheetz gas station burger. In fact, I've had better burgers from a Sheetz. If I can find a way to post a picture, I will. This is not a crafty burger. This is not an artisan burger. This is not even a tasty burger. If it wasn't for the ketchup, there would have been no taste at all. And it was small. The sweet potato fries were okay. They definitely have a large selection of burgers, with all different types of toppings. Maybe it was my fault for ordering the basic burger, and they didn't even give me all the toppings included with the basic, so it may not be fair to judge the taste of their burgers, but even if you added the toppings, the burger was still small. Barrel Burger, it is sad to say, offers a better burger and it's right down the street."}
{"text":"Love this place! The burgers are awesome, I like mine wrapped in lettuce. They come with 2 sides- for $8 you can't beat it! Would have given 5 stars, but it usually takes a few minute of standing around before being greeted by the hostess. They are understaffed at times but I will definitely be back for the yummy burgers!"}
{"text":"After reading and hearing how great the burgers were, decided to give it a try last night.  Hostess was super friendly and efficient. Our waitress was ok, but she was more interested in hanging out with the birthday party in the back corner.  Zero personality. 

Asked about temp of burgers and was told Medium. My burger arrived Med Rare but not looking or runny juices, so I just dug in.  Burger was not hot. Bun was cold and stiff, not heated or soft.  Apple slaw was great. Onion Rings were not rings per se, they were skinny and not crunchy. 

Wife's burger was cooked better, same issue with bun.  Way too much bread when it's hard like that.  Fries were the best thing on the table. 

Ordered a cocktail for $6.50 and it was a good size drink.  Beer was $3.50. 

Overall, prices were good, place was cutely decorated. Need some management on the floor from time to time to check in with guests and keep an eye on the young staff. 

Not sure if we will back.  Must have been an off night for them."}
{"text":"The fried chicken tenders are OUT OF THIS WORLD amazing. Especially when dipped in the honey mustard dressing."}
{"text":"If I really had a choice, it would be zero stars!  Please understand this is for the \"New Crafty Burger next to HT\".  By far the very worst dining experience I have ever had.  First, let's talk about the wait.  There is no one to place your name on the hostess list.  The owner is far to busy schmoozing with the customers at the bar.  Please address the customer who were waiting by your front door for over 1/2 hour.  Please offer maybe a beverage or a beer while waiting for service.  After waiting for 1/2 for services, we were ushered to a table that was dirty.  There was food and grease on the chair where we were seated.  We looked over the menu and saw they do not accommodate people with gluten or dairy intolerances.  Their lettuce wrap is one wilted few day-old lettuce.  A lettuce wrap should be crisp and fresh.  It should be half of one iceberg lettuce.  It looks like it was pulled out of the trash.  We first ordered Veggie Burgers.  When they were served, they had the consistency of oatmeal.  It was smashed onto the plate.  It was crumbly, raw, had the consistency of partridge.  The bun was not fresh at all.  The fries were limp and cold.  The oil has not been changed since their opening.  The avocado that we paid extra for was 2 -pieces of moldy and old avocado.  It was covered in grease and oil.  When we brought to the attention of the staff, they stated is was a work in progress.  They have only been open one week.  Please hire a professional chef to run your kitchen.  The young woman said she was gone to provide us with new veggie burgers that were prepared from fresh.  What we received were scraps of the first burger, barely warmed.  It was horrible!  Round two of poor, undercooked, cold mush.  Each time they left us with no food to eat.  Each time we waited at least 1/2 hour for food.  Each time they did not leave us a speck of food.  Not even an offer of a salad to keep our hunger pangs down.  Finally, they replaced the veggie burger with another menu item.  It was a chicken sandwich.  To begin with the chicken was raw, cold, unappetizing, and inedible.  They through on a metal pan with chicken breast, maybe 2 ounces, pounded very thin to look like it was more.  It was definitely cold!!!  It was not proper temperature.  The young woman never came back to ask if it was okay.  Just because you share with the waiter you got the check, we will never be back!!!  Not once did she come over and ask \"Would You Like Dessert\".  We just got a waiter who was saddened by our experience.  Just because you claim it is inexpensive, does not mean to be stingy with your weight of your chicken breast or patties.  A chicken sandwich should be a whole breast.  Not one dissected into 4 thin sheets.   Lessons to learned...Do not eat here ever!  Please take time to train your kitchen staff! ...Stop with the excuses....3 times you're out!!!...We were there to celebrate a birthday and yes, I told the waiter that it was his birthday!!!... Do not open a restaurant unless you are ready!!!  I can train your kitchen staff and keep the budget!!!  Tonight, I believe I have food poisoning, because of all the raw products we tried.  By the way, grease and craft paper tear when cutting chicken!!!  Yes, avocado need to be prepared freshly!!!  In all, you just let us walk the door, very hungry and very ill!!!  Shame on you!!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best burger I've had in Charlotte. The bacon jam is amazing and even better if you top it with apple slaw! Service was amazing and waitress was friendly and on top of her tables. Burgers are around $8-10 and you just can't beat it!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment.

I have been dying to try this place.  All of the pictures and reviews were really good.  I went with the bacon egg and cheese burger with sweet potato fries and a side salad.  The sweet potato fries and the side salad were actually really good.  But the burger? Oh man - it had no taste at all.  All I could taste was the egg.  On the positive side I think it didn't have much salt which was probably good for my health, but the burger lacked flavor completely.

I love Bad Daddy's and think I will stick to it from here forward."}
{"text":"Had lunch early. Food was great with plenty of options. Had French fries and sweet potato fries and they were very crispy and well seasoned. Burger was great and so was the salad.

Very pleasant atmosphere with great service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Best burger!  Had the hot pepper burger.  It was juicy and cooked perfectly.  The bun was fresh and soft.  The crafty beans are to die for. Too full for the fried Oreos but will be going back soon!  The service was great and very attentive.  Atmosphere is pretty cool.  Would pick them over Bad Daddy's every time.  I hope they are successful!"}
{"text":"Was there the first day it opened!  Totally great atmosphere. Went with the family and the food was excellent.  I asked the waitress where they got such fresh rolls and she explained that they were all freshly made right there!

My burger was cooked perfectly and was extremely filling and delicious.

Onion rings were great!  The kids had the fries and since they loved them, and since they are pretty picky eaters, I figure that is a really good sign.

Overall, I would highly recommend and will coming back."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Over cooked. Burger was too small for bun. Corona was in a can. Parking was in the back by the exit. You had to walk around shopping center to enter. Stay away!! I gave it one star because I had to in order to post the review."}
{"text":"I had the Asian chicken sandwich and it was AWESOME. And the onion rings are just the right amount of spicy. I couldn't try the beer because I had to go back to work but I'll be back!  I'm excited to try some of the burgers too!"}
{"text":"We have been long-awaiting a signature burger joint in our area and finally crafty burger came through!  We have been here several times and every time, it is absolutely delish!!! We have never been disappointed. Favorites are: \"the good egg\" burger and the BBQ Burger, and the beans and fries are to die for!  The atmosphere is casual diner with some up class tones, and they make a mean Moscow mule!  Super awesome restaurant and definitely our fav burger joint. Would recommend for sure."}
{"text":"A friend kept telling us to try this place so maybe our expectations were too high. Seat yourself. No atmosphere. Food just ok at best. Service ok.  Not likely to go back."}
{"text":"Yuuuummmmmmm! I'm sitting here eating the Healthy Start Chick'n burger and it's delicious! Got the onion rings and apple slaw and both are so tasty. I've already logged this in my \"places to bring the hubby on the weekends\" to have some yummy food and a beer or two. Thank you Crafty Burger for making my lunchtime happy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I finally tried this place and we were so happy we did! First of all, their jukebox has an unbelievable selection of great blues music. Husband had a make your own burger which he loved - so many delicious options to decorate and devour your burger. I had a cheeseburger with gouda (yes, gouda!) cheese. The fries were great and the onion rings even better, nice and crispy with a little spicy bite. My husband loved the mac 'n' cheese. Everything is made fresh - even the buns!  Breanne was our server and she was just the best - friendly and informative.  Overall, an extremely enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Crafty Burgr. I was hesitant because I thought it'd be expensive, but the prices were reasonable - especially for what you are given. I left feeling pretty full. I had ordered the Cinco Cheese Burgr. It was a good size and came with two sides. I ordered the Mac & cheese and the bread pudding. The cheese on the burger and in the Mac & cheese was a bit spicy for my liking, but that's just me. The food was good. I enjoyed the bread pudding very much. Cool that a dessert-like item could be a side. Our waiter (Josh S) was great. He was knowledgable about the menu, friendly, attentive, polite, thoughtful, and helpful. He was good about carding my boyfriend and I when we ordered beers. He and the manager checked in with us a few times to make sure we were satisfied. I also really like how the place is designed and set up. The beer showcase and the lights over the wall menu are pretty cool. I was intrigued by several items on the menu. I'll be returning to Crafty Burgr so I can try everything. It was an all-around good experience."}
{"text":"I just had one of the best burgers ever! I asked for a recommendation of the bbq burger or the Hawaiian burger. The bartender suggested to combine them. WOW! It is truly fantastic as well as truly messy. The ONLY reason for 4 stars and not 5, was the Mac n cheese. It left a little to be desired but I'll try it again as well. Great atmosphere, service and price."}
{"text":"The definition of a meh 2 star review.  Mediocre burger/chicken/sides/everything.  Incredibly overpriced beer menu...$8 for a hop drop makes zero sense.  They do have a great selection of local beers but the price is in no way worth pulling the trigger.  The atmosphere is not very warm or inviting so i can't say i've felt comfortable there to make it worth buying multiple beers even if it was a reasonable deal.  Service has been very disinterested and unhelpful.  I've been 3 separate times over the past 2 months, always trying to give it another shot, and they have never been able to redeem themselves in any category that carries weight in my mind."}
{"text":"Just as good as the original location! This time I ordered the Aloha Burger without the bun. Delicious! With us living so close, this will definitely become a place that we will frequent."}
{"text":"We went around 8 on a Friday and it was steady, but we were lucky to grab an empty booth. The place isn't all that big, so it might be hard to get a table at peak hours. 

It was a seat yourself set up, yet our waitress still kind of sat us. She was very good through the entire night and very friendly. 

I got the egg burger with bacon. All of their burgers come with two sides. I got mac and cheese and fries. The burger itself was very good, but not very big, especially for a nine dollar burger. I think two patties was around eleven dollars, which is kind of a high price for a burger at a place likes this. The fries were good and the mac and cheese was just okay, nothing special. My friend got a salad and it looked good and was a big portion. 

We didn't get it this time, but next time I think I'll have to try the avocado bites and Gouda sticks. 

There isn't a whole lot of good restaurants in Cornelius, so I think we'll be coming back here if we're in the area."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere of this place, but it is small.  My burger was mediocre at best, and I didn't like the Mac and cheese.  However they offer bread pudding as a side, and it is awesome!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the service was so bad to the point of I wouldn't want to go back. To busy talking to the staff at the bars and not helping he was super helpful with the other tables but ignored us 80%of the time."}
{"text":"I like my burgers medium rare, and this burger came out perfect! Not to mention the delicious onion rings. I can see this spot becoming the perfect local watering hole and eatery. I am happy to have Crafty come to my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Delicious burgers and grilled chicken.  Salads are yummy and sides are good too!  While family likes this place."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB!! I wish they had one in Denver..... They have a great section of beers and the food is ole so good. Slap your mom for another bite."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING.  The burgers are delicious, my personal favorite is the Aloha Burger.  Mac and Cheese is awesome.  Beer selection is vast and frequently changing which gives you a reason to return often.  The staff and overall vibe of the place is great too.  GO HERE (but not everyone because i like that there's never a wait to be seated, even on a Friday/Saturday night)

P.S. Try to save room for the deep fried Oreos"}
{"text":"Great place that needs to be recognized. Absolutely wonderful services, reasonable prices and tasty quality food."}
{"text":"Burgers were great! We had the bacon jam burger and the hot pepper burger and both were delicious; full of flavor and well cooked. The Mac and cheese as a side was to die for. Could've eaten that all day. The apple slaw is literally just coleslaw with apples so nothing to write home about but the fries are good as well."}
{"text":"This is a great little locally owned restaurant in the Lake Norman area of Charlotte NC. I had the burger and it was delicious, fresh, and cooked perfectly to order. It has a great interior and friendly service on top of the great burger. Another great restaurant that I highly recommend trying in Cornelius."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice in the past week. Once was for take out, which I don't recommend. By the time you get your food home it will be cold. There take out boxes do not keep the food hot or even warm. I then tried eating in. My sandwich was good, but the sides need some help. The owner was there and was receptive about my concerns with my to-go order and took 50% off my bill. Which was nice. I think that this place will improve because the mangers and owners seem to care about improving the quality of there product. I will try it again in a month or so and see if it improved. Good service though!"}
{"text":"Great burger! Id choose Crafty over Five guys not only bcause of taste but the value is unbeatable. A burger and two amazing sides for less than 10 bucks!"}
{"text":"Neil was such a pleasure , to talk to. He was so personal and friendly!! Him and his father own the place ... My foodie fiancé and myself , we're pleased to enjoy such tasty food..  Service was awesome and Josh the bartender super !!!And it didn't hurt that he lived in Maryland ... Lol.  We will surely turn all of foodie friends, on to this burger joint .. Over all great time .. And they serve local brews .. Support local love that !!! See u again soon..  
Val & Tim"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here you are missing out.  The burgers rank at the top of any hamburger I have ever had.  The bun is soft and fresh, the toppings are perfectly done and high quality.  The prices are more than fair for all the food you get.  We had the BBQ burger and this incredible grilled PBJ also available with bacon :). Stop in, you will leave Happy"}
{"text":"I like Crafty Burger and this new location in Antiquity is great! Their burgers are very reasonably priced and you get a choice of TWO sides. Not many places offer that. They have a great chickpea seasonal salad that I always get and then I rotate between the Mac n cheese and fries. The veggie burger is one of the better ones I've had, but need burgers are great too. I love the BBQ and bacon jam one. I only wish the buns were a little more artisanal. Since the burgers are so loaded, the buns become pretty moist and mushy quickly. They have a nice patio here as well as indoor seating. I happened to call ahead and place an order to go, and it was ready in 15 minutes. Will definitely be spending a lot more time here!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good beer selection and good food. One negative is that they don't have turkey burgers and there menu isn't overly creative. But they do have the create your own burger option, where you can determine your own toppings. They also offer salads, chicken sandwiches, and some yummy apps (think gouda stix, loaded fries and avocado bites). 

I liked their veggie burger. They are made with a blend of quinoa, kale, brussel sprouts and carrots. It isn't solid like other veggie burgers though, it's much softer.  Add some gouda cheese to it and you're golden. The side salads are nothing special, don't waste the extra $1.00 upcharge. The quinoa salad, though, is another story. It's a delicious side, made with the cabbage, kale slaw and golden raisins for some natural sweetness.

They have 10 beers on draft that they rotate, including local beers from D9, Assclown and Catawba Brewing. They have many more bottled options as well. Neat little patio space outside as well. Great lunch spot if you want to go outside of Birkdale."}
{"text":"OK burgers. Not so good service. Good initially but went down hill. Got drinks quick but took forever to get her back for food order. We did ask for a couple of more minutes. Guess a couple is about 15 these days. Never asked for refill until we were ready to leave. It's a small place but she always seem to disappear. On the plus side the Mac and cheese was really good as were the onion rings(straws)."}
{"text":"The short version: the burgers were barely average but the sides and service were great.

The positive of this place really focuses on the customer service and the amazing sides. We started with the Gouda cheese sticks, I know other reviews didn't find them amazing but we did. The melty goodness had a great batter and the ranch/BBQ dip was really a good pairing. With the burger we got the Mac and cheese, which seemed to have an extra something savory in it, and the bread pudding which was sweet but not too sweet. If I had to stop there this place would be a five but I must continue...

The burger... the name sake of this joint was blah. The bun was dry and stayed dry since he meat was also dry. No grill flavor or juices with this burger so don't look for it. The sell was that it was a garlic burger, a Halloween these to keep the vampires away. I'm pretty sure even vampires wouldn't have noticed the garlic flavor either. The burger was just so dang boring it can't be what they are supposed to be good at. 

Try again Crafty Burger..."}
{"text":"I had the grilled chicken salad it was so fresh and the perfect portion great beer selection and excellent service I'll def be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since it opened. We have always enjoyed the food, even when the AC was out we stayed and ate. We visited this week and were really disappointed. Seems the management has changed and so has the customer service. I ordered a single hot dog with chili and cheese on it, no sides, husband ordered a basic cheese burger. The cheeseburger was very rare in the middle, they did bring out another one that was cooked better. When we received the bill I was charged $7.49 for 1 single hotdog, and another $1.50 for cheese & Chili, I questioned why it was so expensive and the manager said just because I didn't want the sides they will still charge for them. The manager was getting ready to leave and said since I already paid she couldn't do anything. Really disappointed considering we spend a good amount of money there and usually come in with our out of town guest."}
{"text":"Second time here and I do like the atmosphere and the food is good. My problem is the staff isn't restaurant professional. My server was very nice and did a great job on second visit. However, my burger was missing an ingredient that I had asked for so i simply asked for a side of that since they forgot. The waitress apologized and went to get me some but came back and asked to take my plate to the kitchen to prove that the item was missing. Now, first this is not professional and gross, second isn't the customer always right? I should have said no, and let the cook come to me if he thinks I am lying. It really ruined my meal and had me mad the rest of my dinner."}
{"text":"Wanted to love, and we'll try one more time but they missed.  We ordered the Whole Farm burger (might have gotten the name wrong, but big burger, 2 patties) medium rare, fries and Crafty Buns for our sides.  The burger was well done and then some vs. medium, or our requested medium rare.  Burger needed more seasoning, too. The fries could have been awesome if served fresh and hot. The beans were tasty but served at room temperature with chilly spots in them.  We weren't sure if they were supposed to come out warm, which we expected, or if it was a cold item, but they were somewhere in between, leaving us wondering.
As far as $10 burgers go, it left us disappointed, yet I think they have the basics for a great place.  The service was excellent and we like the ambiance.  The kitchen just didn't match up with everything else.  All places have the occasional bad night, new staff or whatever so we'll give them another shot but we really wish it had been better."}
{"text":"Solid.  Good Music.  Good Service.  Good Beer Selection.  I had a Mac N Cheese Burger- would recommend.  Bread Pudding- amazing.  I would recommend!"}
{"text":"We're pretty big foodies and love a good burger!! My boyfriend and I went at 8:30 on a Thursday and were told to sit wherever so we let them know we were sitting outside. Waited 15 minutes and had to go inside and ask for a waitress/waiter. She came outside and took our drink. We waited after she dropped off our dreams for another 15 minutes and went inside and asked for her to take or order. She took it and also took our order for a beer. We got our food not soon after and the burgers were decent. Sides, not so much. Onion rings were cold and soggy and beans were cold. I waited 15 more minutes or so for her to check on us but she didn't so we went inside and asked for a refill that we needed for probably 30 minutes. She gave me a refill and then waited forever and never received the check. I went inside and she was leaning on the bar texting and asked for our check and to make sure the beer we'd ordered 45 minutes ago was not on it. I've probably never had such a worse customer service experience in my life. She ended with \"I'll give you free beer next time.\" What?!?! We needed service then. That visit determined whether there was going to be a next time. We do a lot of company outings and I was hoping this place was our next stop. I'll make sure to let others know that this isn't where they should spend their money. We won't be returning. I have 2 starts just bc the burger was decent."}
{"text":"Had the Mac and Cheese burger- absolutely awesome. Service was good- very hard to find a seat especially with the seat your self policy."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if they struggle with strip mall locale, but the vibe is awesome. They are not a boring burger place and they offer great sides and very family-friendly. Found this place by accident and is now our fave spot on our way to or from the park. Please note venue is small and not ideal for parties larger than four."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a long time. It wasn't greasy it was cooked perfectly. I'm coming back to try other things on the menu. The ambiance is awesome too! Overall A+ the bartender was super helpful too."}
{"text":"Food was good, beer was cold, didn't have to wait too long for any of that.. these are the good things.

Our server was a cool guy but not super attentive. We ended up having to ask the hostess for our check because we couldn't find him and as much as we love sitting and staring at each other we also wanted to get up and go nap our food comas off at home. There were only like 3 or 4 other tables in there so it's not like the guy was busy.. but oh well. Luckily the food runner/fellow server brought out our food when it was nice and hot and the server did come by to check on us. 

I've worked in restaurants for many years so I never write a place off simply because of one circumstance of slow service (unless it's a common occurrence), so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with this place. Great food for a good price and the service is always great. Their bread pudding is awesome and love that it is a side option. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good burger and great comfort food. Also have a good beer selection."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a late lunch (3pm) and had the place to ourselves.  I ordered the bbq chicken sandwich and hubby opted for a burger.  I would recommend the chicken sandwich, it was very flavorful and not overcooked. For my sides I really enjoyed the seasonal salad (diced cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, chickpeas and black olives),  and the onion rings. The salad was refreshing and light alongside the my huge sandwich. I ended up making my own version of their salad at home  the next day!   Hubby's burger didn't appear to be anything special but he said it was good. He opted for fries and cole slaw with his burger.   Our server was very attentive and we enjoyed our meals.  We'd come back if in the area."}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday so it was pretty quiet and we were able to sit outside since it wasn't too hot so that was nice. Kids meal prices are very reasonable and good size portion. My husband had the mac & cheese burger- no complaints or ravs. I ordered the\"Good Egg\" Burger. We weren't asked how we wanted the burgers cooked which is fine bc I like my well done. The burger was well done but the egg was runny. I had to send it back bc I am pregnant, not just complaining, so I asked them just to toss it back on the grill and just cook it down. Instead they made another one but again the egg wasn't cooked through. Luckily, it wasn't as runny so I was able to slide it off without the yolk dripping all over the burger. When asked if everything was alright, I mentioned the egg was still not done but I just wouldn't eat the egg bc my family was already done eating and as a typically pregnant person, I was starving and not interested in waiting any longer. Nothing was offered or comped for the repeated under cooked egg even though it was basically a cheeseburger at that point. Overall, decent food but wouldn't hurry back since they aren't really too concerned with you quality going out."}
{"text":"I will DEFINITELY not be coming back. I pulled in at 9:51PM (which I get it... seeing a customer 10 minutes before closing would suck) I used to work in retail and hated that, but it's part of the job. However, your establishment is open for another 9 minutes; and doesn't close at 9:51.  

Any who, I got out of my car, and a blond bar tender who was smoking said \"you do realize we close in 9 minutes, right?\"  Excuse me?  If only she knew I was there to drop something off to my wife... WHO COMES EVERY WEEK with some friends. Needless to say they won't be coming back, and I won't be coming back.  So rude."}
{"text":"Really awesome place! The different choices of burgers are awesome, as well as the \"craft your own burger\".  Watch the prices though, some of the craft your owns can get pretty pricey.  

All of the main burgers come with two sides! The Mac n cheese and bread pudding are to die for.  You won't go wrong getting those for your two sides. 

They also have a nice selection of local beers from OMB, Triple-C and NoDa. 

Watch out going right at the prime lunch and dinner times though. The foyer gets very crowded and disorganized. It's a seat yourself atmosphere, so customers are trying to decide who came first and what size booths are available. Not very smart.  Especially since the owner of Eez Sushi runs this place too. You'd think they'd implement a better system."}
{"text":"Love crafty! We go pretty regularly for the Boom Boom Chicken Sandwich and bread pudding. 

A previous reviewer seemed surprised that Boom Boom would imply spice.. duh. It's no spicier than a mild buffalo sauce though! 

Highly recommend the bread pudding and Boom Boom sauce!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, rustic decor, friendly staff. Food is amazing!  I got the BLT, seasonal salad and crafty beans.  I was part of a group of 11 and our food came out quickly. We each paid separately and they had no problem with accommodating us. We had a great experience and will be back!"}
{"text":"Really tasty burgers with unique toppings!  This was our first visit and we really enjoyed it a lot.   Service was also pretty quick and nicely personable.  
On this visit, I had the French Fry Burger (features fries and beer cheese), and it was simply fantastic!  My wife had the Good Egg Burger (self explanatory) and it was great as well.  The burgers were both juicy, but not so much that it runs all over your arms, etc.
For the sides, we had a 
Down-side:  The Quinoa Salad...decent, but a little sweet for our tastes.  No worries, now we know
Up-Side:  The Crafty Beans...amazing!!  I could be wrong, but these taste like real beans, rehydrated and cooked to perfection (not from a can), and they feature a nice BBQ flavor, smokiness, slightly sweet, a bit of tangy and absolutely wonderful.  We wanna take a bucket to our next cookout!!

Bottom line, great burgers, fantastic toppings, excellent balance of flavors and it won't break the bank!  They also have a great local brew selection.
Cannot wait to return for more!!

{"text":"Wife and I finally stopped in to try the new place. The place looks really small from the outside so I was surprised to see the inside was roomy and inviting. The staff made us feel at home, large selection of burgers and sides. I had the good egg burger and it was perfect. The wife had her vegetarian thing and said how freshly made it tasted. There was a patio but little too hot to sit on the day we went. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD. The buffalo chicken sandwhich is awesome. The ranch is to die for. Love!!!"}
{"text":"Best buffalo chicken sandwhich i've ever had, hands down!! The house made ranch is amazing. I LOVE this place and can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Great food! I made my own burger and it was fantastic! My only complaint is that the place is really crowded."}
{"text":"The food is tasty, cool atmosphere and good selection of craft beer. The quinoa salad and Mac & cheese are good selections for sides."}
{"text":"I visited Crafty Burg'r while attending the 2nd Friday event. The wait was a little over 30 minutes, which wasn't terrible considering it was a Friday night and there was an event going on. The atmosphere was nice although it was a bit tight with so many people. The staff members were kind and attentive.  The prices were great. 

I had the Bacon Jam Chick'n. The fried chicken was moist and delicious. The jam seemed more like dry crumbled bacon, it was good...just not what I expected. I requested the Apple slaw be placed on the side just in case I didn't like it -I'm not a fan of slaw in general, but this was edible. They forgot my side of mayo, but eventually brought it out. My fries were cold, but they were happy to bring me a fresh batch out of the fryer. The crafty beans were delicious and I would recommend getting them. The fried Oreos were good...if I ordered them again I'd request the chocolate sauce on the side because it was a bit much for me. The fried bread pudding was out of this world and the caramel sauce came on the side of them so you could choose how much you wanted, unlike the Oreos. The portions were fairly generous. 

If I lived in the area I would definitely return."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and it was a tasty lunch.  Portions were generous for lunch, could easily have split it.  The bread pudding is worth the indulgence!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love coming here. Food is excellent. Service is always great. Love the beer selection and love the music as well. Just a cool vibe place. Definitely recommend it. We have yet to order anything we haven't liked on the menu. Reasonable prices and a good overall atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good burgers and fries but a bit small. Staff is friendly and attentive. Low key place."}
{"text":"Been back and food was tasty. Burgers great. Service is good"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. The service is very sufficient and friendly.
They have a nice selection and will accommodate you any way they can. 
The burgers are good but the single patty seems on the small side. If you have a tendency to say \"where's the beef?\", get a double."}
{"text":"Service Starts our Great but Dies in the End

This is the 2nd Crafty Burg'r in Cornelius and has been open a for about a month. I've been to the other location in Kenton Place a couple of times after they first opened but stopped going because of poor service as in being totally ignored,

Decided to give this place a try tonight on my way to meeting with some friends to see if it had improved. 

At first I was thrilled with the service. Walked in and the hostess asked where I wanted to be seated. Seats were available immediately at the bar and it would only be couple of minutes for a table. She then asked if I would be willing to sit on the patio. Beautiful day with nice sunset so why not.

My server was out in just a minute, gave me a set of menu's and took my drink order. She was back in under a minute and by that time, I was ready to order. My order was a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and for my two sides, I ordered Fried Onion Rings and Crafty Beans.

With my meeting at 8, I was a little concerned about how long it was going to take to cook my meal but it was ready in record time.

All in all, the meal was fair. The Buffalo Chicken had just the right amount of heat and the Chicken was nice and moist which was good. Took much dressing on the Sandwich made for a very messy meal.  The Fried Onion rings are more like onion straws and I don't know what to make of the Crafty Beans. It's like BBQ Beans but made with what appears to be three different types of bean.  Some heat but they really don't cut it.

This where service died.  The hostess walked past and I asked her if she could get our server to bring my check since I needed to leave shortly.  5 minutes later I'm getting ready to get and go in and hand the hostess $20 to cover the bill and leave. (Bill actually came our to somewhere around $12.56). About this time, the server walked out and handed my my check to which I looked at it and handed her back the check and my credit card. She went to the next table and apparently knew the patrons and after a brief discussion with them, took their order.

After she took the order, I stopped her and took back my card and gave her the $20 and told her to keep it, I didn't have time to wait on change.

She took the short term approach and was thrilled about the 50% + tip not realizing that the only reason she got it was not for good service but grossly inferior service.

Ended up in the end, taking about 15 minutes plus to pay my check and I was late at the next meeting.

Same poor service as the original"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers, interesting sides, generous portions and reasonably priced. Davidson-Cornelius needed a good burger joint!"}
{"text":"OK but not outstanding

Went for lunch today but lackluster results. Walked in and while crowded we seated pretty quickly and were immediately greated and made to feel at home. That disappeared as soon as we placed out ordered.

I ordered the Whole Farm Burger which was a double. Reciept shows I ordered a medium although I was never asked how I wanted my burger. I would have ordered medium rare but ended up with not medium but very well done, jus this side of charcoal.
 
With that you get two sides and for my sides, I ended up wtih hand cut fries which while they need work, were not bad. As for the Mac and Cheese side, back to the Drawing Board on that one.

Wife  had the Veggie Burger which ended up being mostly beans.

Atmosphere was very noisy and you could not talk to your companion. Tried the WiFi and while logging on was OK, not enough bandwidth to check on news feeds , home emals etc. Ended up giving up and going to my smartphone which was not logged onto their router to get anything meaningful.

Summary: Foods OK but there are better option in the area.  Servive is good initially but once you place your order, forget about anything else. Other ammenities are afterthoughts andwhile there, are not functional.

OK at best"}
{"text":"Nice little local burger and brew place, small but it works.  Counter seating is best here.   Burgers are above average with great sides.   Cost is reasonable.  Definitely a great lunch option.  Easy parking."}
{"text":"Best burger place in Cornelius/Huntersville. The burgers are fantastic. They give you huge portions and the choices for burger toppings seem endless. Large beer selection and great mixed drinks too. The sides are fantastic. I especially like the mac and cheese and onion rings. Definitely one of my favorite local joints."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. I really recommend going around lunch or possibly a little after those hours to avoid a crowd. My group had a variety of food and everyone was satisfied with their meal. There's a variety of food options available and also even better, some very good craft beer options. It reminds me a little of Killingtons in Huntersville and on par with its quality. While maybe a little expensive as a whole for your meal, you're still getting your money's worth based on portion and again, the quality. Worth a visit. 

Service was friendly. 

Parking is easy."}
{"text":"3 or 4 stars!  The produce and toppings on the burgers were the bomb. Loved the pimento burger, fresh bacon and fresh veggies. Absolutely loved the crafty beans side and the fries. Great side salad and mac and cheese too!  The reason for 3 stars is the meat. The meat is A-OK but absolutely nothing memorable (at least this trip for us). Was a bit dry, wasn't seasoned well...in fact it didn't really taste like anything. Even though everything else was delicious, I'd venture to say that the meat is the most important part of a burger place. We will be back though because really, the sides and toppings were awesome and maybe the meat will improve!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit here and the last visit. For a burger place, the burgers weren't very good. It tasted like ground beef without any seasoning. The fries were really good."}
{"text":"Just tried this place out for the first time at lunch and it was really good!  I had their Asian salad, which is a kinda strange thing to do at a place called \"Crafty Burg'r\" but I was looking for a lighter lunch and this hit the spot.  The health conscious lunch went right out the window, however, when I saw they served FRIED OREOS as a dessert.  OMG - you have to get these!  ha!  They are delicious.  

I'll definitely be back to try other things on the menu.  This is a great little \"unknown\" spot that is serving really good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by last night for dinner.  the location has a lot of parking since the former Lowes food store is no longer being used.  I don't know how long this place has been opened but i can see a learning curve for the staff.  we had to ask one of the servers walking past us to get our order taken.  when we did get our order, my wives burger was under cooked and it was taken back.  they returned a couple of minutes later with a whole new hamburger cooked just right.  The food was very good.  i did not like the bread pudding.  i think they may have microwaved it and it just got rubbery.  

By the time we left they had people waiting to be seated.  I liked the food and the prices and I think they will get better with the service, we will definitely come back and try it again."}
{"text":"Got to go here for a private party -- the cinco cheese burger was amazing. Love that you get two sides with the burgers & the food was great! Very clean and unique feeling- I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Surprised this joint has low reviews, maybe this is due to the fact that they just opened.  I liked everything about it.  The service was excellent, the food decent, the craft beer selection was great, best of all I liked the atmosphere.  We went with the French Fry Burger and the Good Egg Burger.   Two sides - mac n cheese and onion rings.  Good stuff, we liked it and had a great time."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Staff takes good care of their customers. Can also sit outside as and great sides with the best burgers."}
{"text":"Food is delicious service was fantastic.   Had the \"good egg\" burger.  Absolutely perfect.  Our friends had the the aloha burger and fried pickles, all delicious.  Thank you Olivia for the excellent service.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Finally tried the Crafty Burg'r and was pleasantly surprised. Previous reviews had given me reservations about coming here, but it was inevitable as I'm a \"get my own experience\" kind of gal. I was not disappointed. Being a Pesca Terrian, no that is not a religion, it's a life style choice, it can be challenging to find truly delicious fresh made food when I go out to eat. Kudos to the chef at Crafty Burg'r for making a very tasty house made veggie burger. I had mine with the Sriracha mayo and beer cheese with the apple slaw and fries. The apple slaw was AMAZING and paired with the veggie burger made a new flavor experience that will haunt me and draw me back for more.  The beer selection isn't huge, but you must take that lightly as we are in beer country and \"not a huge selection\" means there were only 18 beers and 6 on draft.... My meatasaurus husband had the Good Egg burger with the onion rings (which were addictive) and gave high remarks on flavor, texture and portion size. It's going to be difficult, but try to save room for dessert because the bread pudding is worth it. It's luv in a confection.  4 stars only because I need to go back three or four time to rate consistency. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"Live in Antiquity so was very excited about Crafty Burgers.  First time food was good but service was terrible.  Visited 4 times since.  Onion rings very greasy. Ran out of fries!!  Slow although they were not busy.  A mess in the kitchen.  Sat in last booth and floors were very dirty.  Hope they get their act together!!!"}
{"text":"The food, service and drinks were on point. The fried avocado are so yummy! The burgers and fries are yummy too."}
{"text":"Going to make this short and sweet as I'm not a big one to \"review\". Great place, burgers are awesome and so is the other options. I highly recommend the Buffalo chicken sandwich. Fantastic beer options as well. Couldn't be happier to have Crafty Burg'r on the east side of Cornelius!"}
{"text":"This place serves the best burger in town!!
Everything made fresh in house. They make their own buns and hand cut the fries daily. Ya gotta go here!!!!! The presentation is well thought out too. So go eat delicious food and chill with the cool blues music! I'm a chef btw and know what good food tastes like!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers! Super tasty very thin onion rings were my favorite side dish. The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious. The baked beans were also very good."}
{"text":"I must say...I'm not a burger fan.  But I am a fan of Crafty Burg'r burgers!  I had their special hawaiian burger and it was by far the best burger I've ever had!  It needs to be a regular menu item!  A cute place with a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I hate to say we weren't impressed with this place neither with their food or their service. We started off with the Gouda Sticks which unbeknownst to us was spicy and not to our liking. I know it's a burger joint but I wasn't really feeling a burger so I tried their BOOM BOOM CHICKEN SANDWICH which was also spicy and no indication on the menu that it was spicy. Their Cobb Salad was ok nothing to rave about and we skipped dessert although they had some interesting choices. 

 I think servers should definitely inform the customers of spicy dishes especially if the menu does not indicate it is spicy. 

We won't return."}
{"text":"This is my go-to restaurant here in Old Town (downtown) Cornelius. Best bang for your buck by far! Burgers are delicious and meals come with two sides... all for typically $10 or less. Not sure where else you can find that good of quality, portion and value.

Drink selection is on-point, too. They have a fantastic selection of cocktails (my favorite is the Adult Cherry Coke) and local craft beers. Highly-recommended for a fun and casual lunch or dinner for friends and family!"}
{"text":"I want to like it....but....the place is filthy.  There is no way to cover up sticky floors, sticky chairs and sticky tables.  My daughter's water glass looked like it had not been washed (ever) and it was just gross.  I'm not particularly picky, but I do expect restaurants of this caliber and price point to be cleaner than my old fraternity house after an all day kegger.  You are not selling nickel beers and cheap burgers - so clean up the funk.  Unfortunately the filth ruined the dining experience for us and we all agreed that we won't be going back...my advice to management - you're not a college dive burger joint so keep your restaurant clean."}
{"text":"Initially it was crowded and they have a seat yourself sign. One waitress was very friendly and even while taking care of her tables she made everyone welcome coming through the door and helped people get tables in a fair manner.

Our waiter was knowledgable and friendly. We ordered fried pickles as an app which you could tell they were made in house.

You get 2 sides with your burger, I had Mac n cheese and fries. Fried were good, Mac n cheese was pretty good.

Husband got the egg burger and I crafted my own.

We will be coming back and bringing friends!"}
{"text":"I got a veggie burger with sweet potato fries and it was delish! I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"This is where I ate the best burger I've ever had! 
When we first walked in we were greeted right away with a smile, and shown to a table. Our waitress was friendly and was happy to make small talk with us! (We were visiting from out of town) 
I got the BBQ burger and it was so delicious! The apple slaw and fries were very good too. I look forward to going again next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Passed by Crafty one day and made a mental note to go back.  Finally got some time to experience Crafty and had mixed feelings.  When you walk in, it has a cool vibe that you want to hang out and enjoy.  Obviously came for the Burgers....

Got a Double Cheese Bacon Burger (note that the waitress told me that each patty is about 5oz) with Fries (you two sides with your meal which threw me for a loop.  My wife got the regular cheese burger with apple slaw and onion rings.  

Overall it was ok.  

The Good - Burger was Very Juicy. Fries were the shoestring style (nice and crispy).  The appleslaw was really good.

The Bad - Burger had really no flavor to it.  Onion Rings should be \"Onion Rings\" not those straw pieces (too many people do that).  

I am not sure that I will be back as the main things that are supposed to be good were just mediocre."}
{"text":"This is the second Crafty location I've visited, and I definitely liked it more than the Huntersville spot. The bar is a little more inviting and its in a really cute spot in Cornelius. Our large party had to wait about 20 minutes (on a Friday night, not too bad), but we were able to grab beers and hang outside while we waited. The dining room is a little small, but I have a feeling they like it this way, because the place always seems to be packed.

Since I've eaten at one Crafty before I decided to switch up my order and go with their version of a Cheese Burger salad. Honestly, it was AWESOME. All of the great flavors of a classic burger, just in a salad. I would absolutely get this again. Despite being in a large crowd, our food came out fast and prompt after we ordered. The service was also fantastic. Drinks always full and no issues splitting checks with multiple diners. They have an awesome draft and bottled selection of local beers and were really friendly about giving small samples before ordering. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Before we break down the food, let me say the service was great, and the space is nice and clean. There's a nice size patio out front, but today it was so hot we opted to go inside.

If you're into craft brews, they have a huge selection. I'm not a drinker so on to the food! For an app, 3 of us split the fried avacado bites at the recommendation of our server. They were unique and lightly breaded and paired with a cool bang bang sauce. I liked the different options offered here and would definitely try the gouda cheese sticks next.

I ordered their take on a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger with the seasonal salad side option (Mediterranean Chickpea Salad) and Poppyseed Apple Coleslaw. Side salads were good but came in these little jars that, while they were \"trendy\" just were too difficult to eat out of. A small carafe would've been fine. The bacon on my burger was perfect. I was disappointed there was no bunless option (mainly a lettuce wrap!) because I prefer to not waste my daily carbs on bread. (Give me the good stuff!) 

Overall I have to say, really good, but not mind blowing. It's a convenient local burger joint that will satisfy your burger craving and strays from standardized chains, which is nice! If I'm back in the area or looking for something close by but not in Birkdale, I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Worth the trip. Exceptional burgers and sides. Just made a second visit and it is as good as I remember. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The burgers were delicious and the onion rings were good too. Great service and yummy dinner. We also had the lettuce wraps and mushrooms for an app. Both were tasty.  We will go back."}
{"text":"Crafty burger is a excellent burger restaurant with very reasonable prices. We have the bean salad and apple salad as sides with a veggie burger.  And fries onion rings with the bacon jam burger.  All great. Service was friendly and helpful.  Definitely worth going to.  We will be going often."}
{"text":"OK.... not worth a second trip. Fries are not crispy, very greasy. Burger has no taste and it is pretty small. Service is okay, nothing stellar. The bacon bites are good but unfortunately that's the only thing we liked it. The onion rings were not crispy, were more like raw onions with just a few breaded crust around it. It was completely uneatable. The crafty beer we ordered was also on the bad side. It was a waste of money to be quite frank... for what we spent here we would have got a MUCH better burger somewhere else. It was $40+ for a family of 4 (2 kids meals). The server asked me my opinion as I walked out and I told him I wasn't happy and he was like -- oh come'on ! -- Well, while I do understand his disappointment, perhaps it was better to listen to my comments..."}
{"text":"where 5 other restaurants tried this same location and failed...Crafty Burger is thriving, it may be in part b/c all of the new business condos & apartments along Kenton Square...but whatever the reason, this place is a safe bet for a good burger...I don't say that lightly, when I do want a good burger-it's gotta be good..it's cheaper than some of the other guys & has a good list of drinks, beers & wines...I wish I could have gave a 4.5, only reason it did not get a 5 was b/c this is very, very \"family friendly\" place...be prepared for a kid or 2 to be running around during daylight hours...but hey, since it has a touch of \"Family Friendly Welcome\" thrown in, it does not have the Creepy Old Guy at The Bar vibe...at night it, or after 8pm, all I could see were \"grown-ups\"...so go with that...Burgers of every taste, flavor-including Bison & Chicken, great small sides including bread pudding & mac & cheese,"}
{"text":"I like the idea of pairing craft beer with a good burger, so i decide to meet a friend for lunch around 1130am before it got to busy..I ordered the good egg burger with  Mac n Cheese and shoes string firies. I can honestly say it was the best burger ive had in a long time. Great service, EasyParking, Great  Beer Choices, with a very comfortable seating area...Hands down the best burger joint in Cornelius!"}
{"text":"So good! Went there for lunch with my girls and they loved it! Best Mac and cheese and bread pudding!"}
{"text":"Just tried this ....overall def would go back. Burgers were great! Also had the grilled  p-butter & apple ...yum.  Crafty beans side was wow!!  Onion rings were disappointing..Mac & cheese was good and the bread pudding ..oh my!!"}
{"text":"Fact being, that my West coast diet mostly consists of tacos, burritos and burgers... These guys kill it with their burgers! Their beans are amazing as well! A new regular part of my diet in NC! Thank you!"}
{"text":"ONE MUST DINE HERE! 
Upon arrival the hostess quoted 20 mins and 5 mins later we were seated! Yup Yup! Our hostess was funny and attentive and made us feel welcomed right as we walked in! 

We started with an order of wine - 19 Crimes red blend and you receive a generous pour for $7!   The hubster ordered a couple of IPA's AB & Wooden Robot a lil late during our meal! 

Our appetizer was the avocado bites likely breaded n fried served with their signature Boom Boom  sauce - spicy  siracha mayo basically but yummy!  

I ordered the bacon jam Chicken Sammy topped with apple slaw n sides of crafty beans a mixture of beans like butter, Lima, white, kidney etc with grd beef n bacon n their seasonal cucumber salad- DELISH! 

Hubster ordered BBQ burger fries n seasonal salad also and we left NOTHING on our plates! 

Service was excellent- Food delish - nice small intimate trendy spot! Do yourself a favor and go!"}
{"text":"Their burgers are amazing but their appetizers are on point. Fried mushrooms, fried pickles and everything else we tried were awesome. Def going back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Avocado bites were delicious along with the great craft beer and burger."}
{"text":"I literally wish I could give this place zero stars. Actually I wish I could give this place -10 stars. This was some of the worst service I have ever had. The food was mediocre at best and that is being generous.

Spoke to a female manager and she showed no remorse for the horrible dining experience that I just had. I am moving very close by and there is no chance I will ever be back. I will tell all of my friends to avoid this place and if I decide I want a burger I would rather drive 100 miles. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I got a delicious (and huge) salad and my husband got a burger. The fries were really good, too. They had a well stocked bar although we didn't have drinks. The atmosphere was bright and fun. The location makes it hip and quaint all at once."}
{"text":"Use to come here and enjoy the food but my last visit was completely terrible. Our waitress not only rushed and gave us our checks before we were done eating but continued to go and take a lunch break and eat on the other side of the room while we waited 20mins for a beer in which another server came over and asked if we liked another beer. Even after that it was an additional 10 mins. I understand if it was a busy day but when there is only 3 people in there in an early afternoon it's completely uncalled for. Younger waitress with short hair and light eyes. No help and terrible service from you. And we weren't the only ones upset for waiting while servers just sit around. LAZY."}
{"text":"This place is great all the way around! Great food and atmosphere! Try to save room because the desserts are wonderful. The staff is very inviting and friendly. The food comes out quickly fresh and hot. This is a must if your in the mood for a quick bite with great flavor!"}
{"text":"Have had burgers here before which are really good as are the sides, nice craft beer selection.  Today had the buffalo chicken salad... Not good.  Chicken was smothered in hot sauce to the point you couldn't taste anything else.  Asked if they could toss the salad with dressing in the kitchen, told no; we were only ones in the restaurant when order was taken.  Had Cranberry & club soda to drink, was charged for the refill.  Disappointed but will return."}
{"text":"I experienced a very ambient and intimate dinner here with my fiancé and friends. The food came out hot and delicious. Our waitress was very attentive and accommodating. The fried Oreos were the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town; taste and price! The atmosphere of this restaurant is very hip and chill. The outside seating is clean cut. The service was quick yet very homely.
Now for the best part- the food. The burgers were very well cooked: juicy, flavorful, and bold. You get two sides with the meals, so for the price it is incredible. 
I will definitely continue to come back regularly."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Eduardo. My husband and I ate here and were disappointed. I had the bacon cheese burger. It was small and tasteless. Bun was like a wonder bun, meat was flavorless. I got the fries and onion rings as my 2 sides. The fries were warm but completely stale like they'd been sitting for 15 minutes. The onion rings were more like onion straws. They were thin and crispy and greasy. Pretty good. My husband had the cheese burger salad. It was a cheese burger and pickles sitting on top of the worst \"greens\" you ever saw. The lettuce was white and full of husks, complete garbage lettuce. Later at home, he got sick. Obviously, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place. I live in the neighborhood so I frequent a few times a month. Food is always fast and consistent, great bar as well. Hands down to Josh behind the bar, always a pleasure when he is working. Best chicken tenders you will ever find. Mac and cheese is always a must when I go. It's crazy you get 2 sides with everything, at the price of a McDonald's meal!! If you don't try it, then you are missing out, that's a promise! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and my complaint is the same....Good food, TERRIBLE SERVICE. Servers disappear and have to be tracked down for refills. Lack of management is going to destroy this place. I would have given 4 stars for the food but the horrible service knocked it back to 3. The owners need to fix the service before this location is ruined."}
{"text":"Busy Monday and I don't feel like going to the house just to rush out for errands so why not a burger on the way?
Why not?
Because the entrance is on the other side of the store than the parking lot. Not a big deal until it is...
raining...
a lot.
Because the guy tending the register sounds like dying cattle when he sings along with song machine...
(apologies to cattle.)
Because that same guy was adjusting his underwear with the same hands he uses to pour your beer...
and count out my change...
So how was your beer?"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the first time. It's got a good selection of beers and a fun menu. My burger (the Cinco Cheese) was excellent, as was the mac & cheese. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meal. The service was excellent; attentive without overwhelming. We'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food on our first visit!  I ordered the bacon jam chicken sandwich and my fiancé had the cinco cheese burger with a veggie patty.  We also had the Gouda sticks.  The highlight of our meal HAD to have been the Gouda sticks and that amazing sauce that came with them!  To die for!  We kept the little jar and slathered it all over our remaining sides!  The chicken was good, though it LOOKED a bit overdone the taste was to my liking.  The veggie burger fell apart a little bit but seasoned vegetarian or vegan diners know that's a pretty common occurrence with a homemade veggie patty.  I was hoping the apple slaw would be more appley but that's just personal preference - it was very good as-is.  The beans were a surprising win as well! We fought over the last sip.  The tiny jars for serving sides were super cute, but a little tough to dig the last bites out of if you're members of the clean plate club.  We hope to return soon and sample more of the menu!  We thought the prices and portion sizes were extremely fair and we enjoyed every bite!"}
{"text":"Lots of great options here. Might be the best fried chicken in Charlotte. That being said the burgers are a solid option as well. We've tried most of the apps top two are definitely fired avocado and Gouda sticks. Fried oreos are really good if you have enough room for them."}
{"text":"Server Caroline was great and beer was good.  Very disappointed with menu burgers were nothing crafty and very small for $10 and flavorless.  Gauda sticks were good though.  May come back to have a beer but def not for the burgers."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of crafty burger goodness. Oh. My. Godddddddddddd yes"}
{"text":"Food was so good, great selection of beer and beverages too. Our burgers were huge, need to unhinge your jaw to get a double on there. Can even image a triple! Fries, onion rings, slaw and beans were all first rate. Employee's were fantastic and cheerful. We would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great food. I highly recommend this place. Bbq burger is delicious. And the Crafty beans are uniquely tasty. We also had the lettuce wraps and the chicken was so good. Also the fried onions are super crunchy. And that coleslaw is mmmmm good. Support local businesses and go here! We are from Cali and wish there was a crafty burg' there."}
{"text":"This place is like if someone always wanted to brew beer and have a brewery but instead opened a really low quality burger joint that is way over priced. The food was cold and nobody working there seemed over 21. Save your money place is all looks with bad food"}
{"text":"Holy Deliciousness!!!! 
My husband and I stopped here for dinner while visiting from NJ and loved it so much we stopped by the other crafty for lunch the very next day and boy was my belly happy. The food was excellent and the staff were very friendly and attentive to us out of towners. Loved this place and will def be back. Will be dreaming of the good egg burger and those bacon wrapped little hot dogs until then."}
{"text":"Crafty Burg'r was a fun spot in a new location. The service was excellent and fast. The burger was cooked to perfection as well. Would definitely recommend the bacon pimento burger! Great for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch to grab a burger and beer. This place is legit. A great beer selection and the burger was awesome. As someone who used to work at a burger bar as a cook, believe me when I say the kitchen knows what it's doing."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  We enjoyed our first visit to Crafty Burg'r, and will definitely return.  I think they are a decent alternative to Bad Daddy's, if you're in the mood for a burger.

I had the mac 'n cheese burger with onion rings and bread pudding.  I probably would have preferred a slice of cheese on the burger, as I like my burgers cheesy!  The server said they cook their burgers medium, but mine was more medium-well.  I really liked the mac 'n cheese (it wasn't too wet), and the bacon was thick and crispy.  I would definitely get this burger again and ask for medium-rare temperature.  The onion rings were nice and thin, and had a delicious, spicy coating on them.  I only wish they had been a bit crispier.  The bread pudding had good flavor, but it could have benefitted from additional sauce. 

My husband had the Rolling Hills of Carolina chili burger, also cooked medium-well.  His was topped with cheese, and he really loved it.  He had the fries and beans as his sides.  The fries were thin and nicely crispy, and he also liked the beans (they were a bit sweet for my taste). 

Service was fast and efficient.  The atmosphere was comfortable, and we enjoyed the blues music they were playing.  

The value here is really good.  Our burgers were just $8.99 and $8.69 with two sides.  Next time, we'll order our burgers medium rare, but other than that, we both thought the burgers were pretty good.  Definitely worth a repeat visit!"}
{"text":"Have been here three times since they have opened. 

The atmosphere is fantastic, good music choices across the board, light is low but not too dim, the booths are high back providing just enough privacy. The beer selection is right out front to set the tone.

The burgers are very good! I like the variety of options. Anything featuring their beer cheese has been best. I have had the Cinco, the Good Egg, and the Rolling Hills. The fries were a little undercooked but yum. The Mac and Cheese was made with beer cheese, gives it unique flavor and texture. It won't be to everyone's taste but I dig it. 

Rare, the kids meals are $4 with a drink, what a value. We love that our family of four can eat here for less than thirty bucks. This place is off the beaten path but worth the jaunt."}
{"text":"Great food and great service by Ashley!  Try the fried avocado!!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great burger, great service. Not sure what the other complaints are about but I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"What can I say,  Fresh, great burgers, great salads,  awesome wine list. and awesome craft draft beers.
Staff very friendly.  And place is immaculately clean.  AND DOGS ARE HUGELY WELCOME ON OUTSIDE PATIO!!!
Ask for Patricia!!!"}
{"text":"We were greeted by the bartender once we walked in (bar faces front door), which was a good start. The restaurant was also very clean, and the background music was excellent (bluesy rock when we were there). Our waitress was efficient, but she never smiled and seemed like she didn't want to be there. 

As far as the food goes, the burger (and the bun) were really good. Better than I expected. The fries were also strong. And the salad with balsamic vinaigrette was very enjoyable. Another positive was ideal portion sizes. And the prices are fair. 

I gave it a four instead of a five for two reasons. One, the depressing waitress. Two, while all the food was very good, I didn't leave saying, \"That was amazing. I need to go back next week.\" 

We will be back, and I debated between four and five stars, but service is really important to me. If you ignore the service aspect, I give it a 4.5, which would be rounded up to a 5. 

I think a lot will depend on your expectations going in. If they're realistic, you should be happy."}
{"text":"Honestly the food is a bit overrated. When you compare the burgers and food to Duckworth's it's not that great. The sides seem very quickly put together and not very well seasoned. Some burgers are average while the others lack in sauce, flavor, or soggy. I've tried this place multiple times and each time feel a bit disappointed because I'm hoping it will be better. Like I said, it's pretty average. If you're looking for late night quick food, this is your place. Something that's not delicious but will get you fed."}
{"text":"This is exactly what I look for in a local place.  Great selection of beer and awesome food!  Lettuce Wraps are amazing and the burgers are excellent!  Service was super fast, friendly and accurate! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Friendly, excellent service good food with sides served in little mason jars! Second visit and both times have been good experiences with outstanding service! Shout out to Kat behind the bar and Jen one of the servers! This place won't disappoint for casual dining at a reasonable price! Salad a tasty and different combination tomatos, cukes, beans and onions in a vinagrette dressing."}
{"text":"by far the BEST burger i've ever had! The Aloha burger is pure amazing! wonderful customer service and not too expensive."}
{"text":"I just don't get the hype or the 4 and 5 star reviews for this place.
They serve a smallish burger with 2 sides which is odd, 'cause if you serve a decent size burger one side is plenty.
Burgers start at $8 and go up to $9.50. Then there's a list of \"premium\" toppings at 50 cents to $1.00 each that can drive the price of your burger even higher. When in the hell did American cheese become a \"premium\" topping???
Burgers were ok, nothing to write home about. Same for the sides. We tried the crafty beans which was an odd mish mash of red kidney, green lima and what looked like pork n beans in a broth. Wife said they were ok, one spoonful was enough for me. Mac and cheese failed to impress.
What really bummed me out about this place was the bill. Two burgers with sides, two teas, tax and tip pushed the bill to just shy of $30, which I thought was way over priced for smallish burgers with just fair sides. I've ate at burger joints that were way better and cost much less.
I would have been much happier if I had taken that $30 to a grocery store, bought some ground chuck, buns, fixings and a case of Land Shark, then went home fired up the charcoal grill and threw down on the deck.
The only way you will see me in the place again is if some one else is pickin' up the tab!"}
{"text":"Good food, great beer selection, and great service. It is an excellent value compared to other burger joints in the area! I love that you get two sides with your burger for under $10. I also love the glass jars the sides are served in.. The mac & cheese and baked beans are my two favorites."}
{"text":"Loved the sides. But that was about it. We went on a Saturday so they were a bit busy, so I will give them thtat, but they dont seem to igve you a waiter so it seems like they all help serve you. We ordered and then waited and waited. Still ok But we all ordered our burgers medium rare and they were all well done. Now one thing I do ask for in a burger only place is if you are only doing burgers, then at least get the temp right. The tea was good and so were the sides but the burger was about the same as I can do at home.  Its seemed a bit dry and crumbled, most likely because it was well done. I did like the way they made the lettuce as a bun when I asked for no bread due to allergies.  The decors is super nice"}
{"text":"First time and last
Burger was okay. Nothing special. 
Cheese sticks weren't cooked all the way. 
Sides were smaller than the pictures on web site."}
{"text":"Came for lunch while visiting the area! There wasn't a ton of seating outside but we were able to squeeze our group of three at a smaller table since the other tables were full. It took a little while for a server to attend to us, but the service was fine overall. I'm a vegetarian and I've had a lot of veggie burgers - I loved theirs!! Definitely would come back if I lived in the area. The apple slaw was delicious with poppy seed dressing. I typically prefer thick onion rings and although these were pretty greasy, the seasoning was delicious and I really enjoyed them! Friends had grilled cheese with bacon that they said was nice and toasty, and their French fries were crispy!"}
{"text":"Nice staff & friendly atmosphere. Unfortunately that's the end of the favorable comments. Had s Carolina Burger & fried pickles, with a side of crafty beans & fries. The burger was overwhelmed by the chili, that tasted like it came from a can. Fries were soft & less than warm. The fried pickles weren't terrible, but everything had to much grease, including burger. I ate the burger, but only tasted the fries & beans. This review sounds terrible, but I could see this just being a bad experience. The food could of sat waiting to be picked up, the place wasn't overly busy & had plenty of staff, so I don't know. Unfortunately, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Took grandson to Crafty Burger for grandpa grandson burger night out. Boy what a disappointment, where's the beef? Ordered a medium cooked single burger, the burger was over cooked (leather), the meat was a little larger than a fifty cent piece, the bun wasn't toasted(I asked it to be toasted) and it fell apart. My grandson ordered the double burger.... where's the beef? Same problem, two patties the size of a fifty cent piece. The onion rings were awful, the beans were ok. The fired pickles were very good. The service was good. 
I'd be surprised if this place is still here next year. Won't be going back!!"}
{"text":"We like to visit this location in Antiquity when we are going to events at Old Town Cornelius. I usually get the Buffalo Chicken Salad, as I'm looking for healthy alternatives. It's a pretty tasty healthy option. 

My other family members do enjoy the burgers as well. The service we have has never been bad, but it certainly is better sometimes than others.

Overall, it's definitely a great option for a burger or salad on this side of town."}
{"text":"Finally came in to try the crafty burgers here. It was... Good? The service was good, we were seated really quickly, the decor is cute. But, the food is just average. We ordered the fried pickles which were great. For my burger, I got the fries and quinoa salad. No, no, no to the salad! It tasted old and soggy. The burger was.... Alright. I mean, it was less expensive than say, Bad Daddy's, but it also tasted that way. I may come back and try it again, but maybe not."}
{"text":"Went there on a whim, and it was delicious!  Great burgers, fries, mac & cheese and onion rings.  Prices very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday afternoon for happy hour. Only had a beer and fried pickles so I can't comment on the burgers. Fried pickles were thin with not much coasting but still very good. Decent beer selection, more bottles than on tap. I'll be back to try a burger."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon and it was fairly busy.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess and then our waiter almost immediately. 
They had a decent number of craft beers on the menu, but we weren't in the mood but I noted it for our next visit. 

We both chose burgers, I had a simple one with just lettuce and pickles and the huz had the bacon jam burger.  As mentioned by others, you select 2 sides - we both got fries and I also got the apple slaw, huz got the Mac n cheese. The fries were a little limp but no biggie - they were shoestring and hand cut and pretty good.  He said  he thought the Mac n cheese had a bacon flavor and was great. The apple slaw was crispy with a rough chop.  Didn't seem like it was sitting around all day getting soggy and it was also delicious. We both liked the idea of having two sides, neither were huge portions.  

The burgers- first I loved the size.  They weren't these ginormous thick burgers you get in some places.  Sometimes I end up ordering sliders because I don't like huge burgers so these were perfect for me.  Maybe 1/4 lb?  Mine was medium well which also works for me but giving anyone a heads up in case you like yours on the rare side.  I thought they were perfectly seasoned.  They were topped by a homemade bun which was soft and delicious and really made the burger.  

Our waiter gave us sodas to go and that was a nice touch. All in all a great experience and we will go back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this rare find a few days ago. These burgers are amazing! Don't leave without trying there signature onion rings and the apple slaw. Cool spot to drop in with friends to eat or just for a cold beer! Love this spot!!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the first time. Friday night 8pm. We had about a 15minute wait. We were greeted. Y one of the nicest hostesses I've ever met. Once seated the server arrived right away and took our orders. They offer a great beer selection and both hamburger and chicken sandwiches. Fried pickles were great (big portion). I had the BBQ bacon burger with fries and Mac n cheese. Mac n cheese was decent. Throw some vinegar on the fries and they were great. Burger was delicious. Great size, homemade bun. It was t overloaded in BBQ sauce like most places seem to do.  Overall, great expierence. Would be a great place to hangout with friends or taking the wife out to eat. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We love Crafty Burgr! We have been there 6 times and have had a great meal every time. We are a family of 4 and have 2 teenage boys who love to eat! Anyone with teenagers know what I mean. We usually start off with the lettuce wraps and Gouda Stix. The Gouda Stix are some of the best cheese Stix you'll ever have. The burgers are fantastic. Fresh and flavorful. Ok - enough about the food. We all know that restaurants are made and broken based on service. All 6 times we've been there - Sarah has been our waitress. Whether she has pink or blue hair she is awesome. She treats you like you are her only customer. Her service and attention is second to none. She has a great sense of humor and makes you feel very comfortable. Food vs. Sarah - we vote Sarah. Sarah is a 10 and food is a 9.9!!!"}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying... This place is amazing and absolutely off the charts. It has a fantastic atmosphere making it perfect fit for anything from an awesome date spot, family dining, or even a sports bar to watch your favorite games. The people are incredible and the service is even better. Chandler was the one helping us out and had a warm smile everyone he came by- he's as sincere as they get. It was an awesome experience with even better food and ice cold beverages. I sampled with my big group - Loaded fries, fried pickles, fried Gouda sticks, jalapeño and bacon Mac, the \"good egg\" burger between the two freshest buns ever, with sides of onion rings and Mac n cheese, and lastly bread pudding. Nothing fell short of a 10/10. I've lived in numerous places like San Francisco, Orange County and even internationally and this is comfort food & just a perfect portioned meal at its finest. You cannot beat the prices and company. I hope this places continues to grow and makes its way out to Southern California. I would give this place a review level something similar to a religious experience. This is a must try and an absolute staple! I will gladly make a flight across the country again to eat here. Ps don't forget the buns make the burger!"}
{"text":"So this was our second time here, and we couldn't wait to come back, and sadly now we won't be back again. The first time we came the burgers were juicy and the sides Oh my goodness they were delicious.... this time we got the tequila lime chicken Club which was dry and definitely not tequila lime seasoning, the best part about that sandwich was the two pieces of bacon, didn't even eat all the chicken. I had the black n Bleu burger and I do mean this patty had absolutely no flavor at all, the mac and cheese that we had been looking forward to was overcooked and stale, the onion straws nothing to complain about there, they are still delicious."}
{"text":"Food here is eh. Burgers are small and not the best. Mac and cheese has a really weird taste that i do not like at all. Onion rings...I would hardly call them that, very oily and stringy. Bread pudding was hard as a rock. Plus there was a very drunk group of people here while I was here disrupting the entire restaurant signing loudly to the music ect. Servers didn't say anything to them."}
{"text":"I can best describe Crafty Burg'r as a poor man's Bad Daddy's Burger Bar.  That might sound bad but it's really that BDBB's sets a pretty high standard against which to judge burgers and sides and Crafty weighs in on both as decent but not exceptional.

I've eaten at the Kenton Drive location a few times now and have for sure never left hungry and believe you get plenty of food for the price given the burgers all come with the choice of 2 sides.  The burgers are generally good flavor wise but have been cooked medium-well to well every time when I always order medium and this leads to them being on the dry side.  The sides I've tried (Fries, Onion Rings, Side Salad) are big and good, not great.

The service has always been fine and friendly and the one cocktail I tried, a Pom-arita, was tasty, tart and had a good amount of alcohol in it so again, value for the dollars spent.

I think what I like best about Crafty is that I can generally get seated with either no or a very short wait at times when I know Bad Daddy's will just be overrun with patrons.  So, when I want a pretty good burger at a close by location and don't feel like hanging around Birkdale Village waiting a while for it, Crafty Burg'r comes through."}
{"text":"This place had the best customer service I've had in my life.
That said, the food is horrible!

I've been wanting to try this place for a while now. Didn't feel like the drive, but finally decided to do it!

For starters, we got chili cheese fries.
Half of them were over cooked the other half were undercooked. The chili was very underwhelming.

My main course was a chili and slaw burger. Not sure how it's possible but the medium well Burger was dry.
It all had the flavor of a High School cafeteria menu.

I wanted to live this place. The staff if awesome."}
