{"text":"Service is kinda slow for afternoon tea. The inside decor has been refreshed since kiko. They kept the chalkboard wall. After noon tea prices are a Lil higher than other places."}
{"text":"So I'm actually leaving this review before all the food arrives, as I'm not exactly sure if it ever will. I came with a couple of friends on a Monday afternoon, and the restaurant was about 1/3 filled with customers. We had all been frequent customers of the previous restaurant that was at this location, Kiko Cafe (which was substantially better). 

First impressions - the AC was evidently not working, as it felt hotter inside than outdoors. The décor was simple and pretty chic, nothing too outstanding. 

We ordered three items: noodles in soup, a chicken burger and a rice plate with chicken as well. The noodles were mediocre as it tasted like my mother's cooking. The chicken burger was smaller than a junior chicken from Mc Donalds, though it came with a decent looking salad. The rice plate was a much more reasonable portion and tasted alright. All three items came with drinks, though we paid extra to change them to cold drinks. We asked for less ice, and our drinks came lukewarm - not acceptable. We asked for less ice, not room temperature lemon tea. 

The worst part of the experience was the wait. It was not a busy time but our food came ridiculously slowly. I finished my entire bowl of noodles before the second item arrived, despite my best efforts to eat slowly. My friends' orders arrived very slowly as well. Don't come if you're hungry. 

To top it all off, one of the waiters was sorting cutlery into a tray and dropped a spoon on the ground. He picked it right back up and placed it back into the pile. I hope I didn't get a dropped spoon too. 

As you've probably already guessed, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is trying to be a higher end hong kong style cafe. While the menu is unique and interesting, the food doesn't hold up and ends up being not worth the price since everything is 2-3 dollars more than a similar dish at a regular hk style cafe."}
{"text":"Being a big fan of the previous restaurant in that location, hoping Fav will be the same if not better. Pretty disappointed I must say. When we went to Fav the first week of opening, the staff seemed unorganized and was getting orders wrong. We gave them a few more chances and have been there 5-6 times since. Not much improvement has been made. The food is actually not bad but it's a shame how bad the management and organization is. One time, arriving for dinner at 6pm, I was told one of their signature dishes \"hainanese chicken rice\" was sold out! Their explanation was that they sold out during lunch time, and didn't bother to prepare more for the dinner round even when they knew it was one of their most popular dishes. 
If you don't ask for plain water or tea when you sit down, you will not get it. When you order a hot tea, it's always luke warm or its dark and bitter. 
Looks like they only hire young waiters/waitresses, which most of them look inexperienced. There was one time all 3 waiters/waitresses where sat down at a table wiping cutlery and chatting. A customer had to get up to ask for the bill.
It's too bad the management doesn't pay attention to the simple details of running a restaurant. 
I think the only thing that kept me going back was the food...but they could really improve on other things. Another suggestion is that the drink menu can be a little more variety beside just plain tea and coffees."}
{"text":"The best hainan chicken rice!!! It's my favourite place to eat this dish. Portions are huge and the sauces are yummy. Looking forward to coming back to try the rest of their menu"}
{"text":"Like most of the previous reviews this is your typical HK style cafe. They've taken over where Kiku's used to be. My wife and I came during lunch and overall it was a good experience. Their lunch menu consists of one page so selection is a bit limited compared to other HK style cafes but the food we ordered was tasty and we had no complaints. 
We ordered the Hainan chicken rice and baked pork chop rice. My wife is usually not a fan of baked pork chop rice but this place she was impressed and actually would come again for it. They cut it up for you and add a fair amount of cheese so that's a plus. 
My only minor complaint is that when you first come in you are not served tea or water right away. You have to wait for the drink that comes with the meal or ask one of the waiters. 
Also take out containers are 50 cents each. 
Overall when we are in the area we will come again"}
{"text":"I originally ordered the Hainanese Chicken Rice but they were sold out of it so I opted for the Nasi Goreng Chicken Rice! It was too dry for my liking with not enough seasoning. However the portions are huge!!! I finished 1/8 of the meal. Overall a good meal for a decent price with typical Hong Kong styled service."}
{"text":"Decent spot for HK style cafe food, although quite pricey compared to other similar restaurants.  While I like the taste of their dishes and drinks (HK milk tea is delishhhh) and the place is clean, the service here is terrible.  All the servers are very rude and really don't seem to give af about the customers.  I usually have lower standards for Asian restaurants, knowing this is not their forte, but the service here is definitely below this standard.  Didn't even greet me when I walked in and just stared at me, and didn't bother trying to seat me, so I sat myself (at which they seemed annoyed about my choice of table).  They then just threw the menus on the table and walked away, and all subsequent servicing was along the same lines (threw our dishes and drinks on the table, constantly looking pissed off, chatted amongst themselves than attending to customers...).

If it wasn't for the poor service and expensive price point, this place would be a 4 star at least.  Quite unfortunate."}
{"text":"The pork chops were nicely marinated and so I could taste the flavour of the meat. The noodles were a bit dry and tasteless though they were coloured. It took a while for the dish to be cooked."}
{"text":"Affordable | HK style Cafe | Modern | Outdoor seating | Creative | Average Food Quality

I came for lunch at 1pm:

Ordered the famous Haienesse Chicken Rice .. dont have  .. ordered dessert (molten chocolate) that was advertised on each table ... didn't have ... all day ... it's only lunch time ...

The original location was in Richmond Hill (Leslie/Hwy 7). It was small only seated a few tables but the food was delicious and I specially liked their Indonesian Chicken Rice with Egg dish. Coming to this location hoping to get the same quality was a disappointment. 

Green curry seafood rice
Tasted like watered down curry water. There was no kick and no fragrance a green curry should have. The seafood was what I expected  (mussels, squid, shrimp, etc.). The mussles didnt seem like they were frozen to me so that was a thumbs up. But in general the \"curry\" was very disappointing.

Tiger shrimp stir fry vermicelli 
It was an okay stir fry dish. Nothing spectacular. Literally what it was.

Steak and fries
Skinny fries with steak piece, complimented with beans, zucchini and carrots. It was okay but at the cost of $17 you be the judge.

HK milk tea/ mix
One of the most failed part of my experience was the HK milk tea. I took one sip and I put it aside. It was not creamy, it tasted watered down, there was no texture or taste that an HK milk tea should have. I then gave it a second try and the mix tea try too. All were disappointing. Being a restaurant in Markham/ Richmond Hill area with so many HK Cafe competitors l, they really need to up their game on this beverage. To me, this tasted like am instant mix made drink. Zero effort."}
{"text":"Typical HK style cafe. Thisis where Kiko used to be.  Average pricing for lunch menu which comes with a hot drink. $1.50 mroe for cold drink.  Decor looks similar but I noticed a 2 new live wood tables which I sat on is a nice addtion to the place.  Services was great, maybe it wasn't too busy when I was there. Around 3-4 tables only.  Lunch was limited in selection as they only had 1 page for it."}
{"text":"Finally I'm here, looking for Hainan chicken rice for a while and a friend recommended me to try it here.
I came for dinner and luckily got the last one( it's not on the dinner menu)

The chicken oil rice is a joke, is like someone mixed the rice with some water, after my first bite I immediately asked for replacement for normal white rice, the server explains that because it's the last dishes and all the oil are concentrated on the bottom. I accept that reason

For the chicken, it's not that fresh, didn't have a chicken taste, the skin are tasteless, however, the meat r soft.

They also do a great job in the sauces and the portion. For this price I'll accept the quality of the dishes."}
{"text":"One of my friends actually came here and gave this place a super low rating. I LOL'ed because I went to the one in Richmond Hill before and loved it. Anyhow, let's see how this one fairs in comparison.

Service
This is what my friend complained about the most, but they were quite attentive. I like it when waiters in a Chinese restaurant refill my water/tea, it's not common that this happens everyday. They greeted us, took our orders, everything was pretty standard. No complaints here. The parking lot gets pretty empty around night time so no worries on backing in when you know you suck at parking lols.

Food
I think the prices here are a tad bit higher than that of normal HK cafes. They range from $8 and up, usually you can find something around $6-7 in normal HK cafes (those simple noodle bowls). I ordered their popular 'Nasi Goreng with chicken' and the portions were definitely big. My main complaint is that the chicken was not tender enough. You know how I love my chicken skin crunchy? They do get that right, but it's too bad that the meat gets sacrificed and it just tastes tough. Overall, not a bad dish and luckily it wasn't the most expensive thing on the menu. My boyfriend, however complained about how his dish was too small. He got the 'portuguese sauce on rice with sausage'. The taste was alright, but he really didn't like the sprinkles of coconut at the top. I actually have no idea why they added those flakes, it adds appearance, but the texture is just meh. Not a good combination, my friend."}
{"text":"This Hong Kong cafe has a lot of unique dishes on their menu, and of course classic dishes as well. They have lunch and tea time specials that come with drinks. We got the Chicken+Chorizo in Portuguese sauce with rice which tasted like any regular Portuguese style rice dish. We also tried the Chicken Alfredo with gemelli pasta. It was creamy and had flavours. Service wasn't that good considering there were only 2 other tables in the restaurant. We also did not get tea once we sat down, but this didn't bother us too much. This is literally the only Chinese cafe that I've been to that charged money for a take out box. Overall, it's a decent cafe."}
{"text":"Def come for their hainanese chicken rice - the one item i would go back for. Only thing is they sell out quickly on a reg ba"}
{"text":"Visited this location after a good experience at the 1st location near Leslie & 7. This one is much bigger, and even includes an outdoor patio area. Came around 2pm on a Saturday and waited around 10 mins, only because we did not want to sit outside. Seating is relatively spacious, although most of the tables are meant for smaller groups of 2/4. 

Ordered the curry beef brisket (w rice) myself, while others ordered the baked seafood alfredo rice and the lotus leaf wrapped rice. The prices throughout the lunch menu are quite decent, with most items ranging from $10-12. Service was attentive and relatively quick. As for the food, the curry was deceptively large, served in a separate bowl with plenty of brisket and a mix of onions, carrots, and potatoes. The flavor was strong but not overpowering, and made for a good mix with the rice. Didn't try the other items, but it seems everyone in my group was satisfied with both the portions and the taste. 

Extras: Cold drinks +1.50 from a lunch meal, takeout box +0.5 so bring your own! points for the free wifi as well. 

Overall, a good experience given the prices. Will definitely return to try more of their offerings (had the Nasi Goreng chicken my last visit thanks to Yelp)!"}
{"text":"The food is good here. Came here two times a d both times the service was horrible. They either need to hire new waitress of give them more training. The first time I came, it took them almost 20 mins to provide me with tea. The waitress came to me two times asking if I ordered tea. Mind you, the tea is already premade all you have to do it pour the damn tea into a cup. She also came back twice asking what I ordered because she couldn't remember.... They have a machine to put down the order.... 

The second time I came, took them 15 min to provide us with the menu. They didn't know where the tables where and kept giving the wrong order at least 5 times. This included drinks, utensils, and food..... They also almost jabbed my friend with a knife while she took it away from the table because they placed it on the wrong table. 

Oh they also give us the wrong bill. 

So, I don't think I will be coming back here. It was a very frustrating experience."}
{"text":"One line summary: one time deal. If there is a zero star I would vote that. Service was bad especially those waitresses. We asked for our bill and showed her we would use credit card prior. She came back without the credit card machine and she was giving us an angry look/gesture."}
{"text":"3.5 for me. I had the Nasi Goreng chicken with fried rice and it was pretty good. The sauce was great and chicken was crispy, it was really unique and I don't really see this dish at other HK cafes. My bf has the rose sauce baked fish with rice and he said it was ok - average. 

Overall I enjoyed my meal - a bit on the pricey side but they have unique items here. Service was efficient and quick."}
{"text":"Food is standard HK fare: mainly pasta and tea. Service is friendly and the space is clean and pleasant. The coffee isn't the best though. I would eat here again in a pinch, especially since the plaza is kind of sparse in food choices but not as run down as the nearby FMP. It gets quite noisy and busy at lunch hour though."}
{"text":"Ongoing search for my FAV meal at FAV cafe + bar continues.  I've tried the Lotus Leaf Wrapped Fried Rice ($10.95) and Nasi Goreng with Chicken ($9.95) and both have some elements of surprises for me in opposite spectrum of the scoring chart.

The Lotus Leaf delivers an aroma as the rice steams it's way to your senses and the pork neck is a meaty tender win but the drawback remains hidden inside as the findings uncover a large chunk of salted fish not quite distributable amongst it's fried rice cohorts with chopsticks in hand.  Pure laziness?  Fish too hard to shred?  Whatever it maybe, it's a step away from being my FAV.

The Nasi Goreng peaks interest for each patron as Indonesian dishes are seldom discoverable in this part of the city.  The Fried Rice is flavoured well and the crispy-ish chicken has good amount of marination topped with a sunny egg.  A nice take on the Indonesian national dish, is it my FAV only time will tell."}
{"text":"Came by for a quick bite. The atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty nice/cozy. Fairly clean, quick service and pretty cheap pricing. 

Went during \"afternoon tea time\" if you are familiar with HK style cafes. For the price, it's ok. I got the fried chicken wings and fries. It came with 3 wings that were smaller than average, and a plate of shoelace-style fries. The fries are similar to McDonalds, except they didn't seem fried long enough so they weren't as crispy/hot as you would expect. 

A little disappointed on the size of the wings that came with the order, even if they were a little bigger, 3 would be ok? 4 would have made up for their small size. 

If you are looking for a quick and cheap bite in this area, it's fine to go to - but there are definitely other options if you look a bit more."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd Fav Cafe location that replaces the old Kiko cafe in the Michael-Angelo's Plaza. Lunch menu is the same as the original Fav Cafe location on West Beaver Creek, but some items like the Hainanese chicken was not available. Could be because still soft opening, as their first day was last Saturday. 

Good tasty food, relatively quick service, and decent price."}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch with my sister. We had the braised beef and daikon with rice, and crabmeat & bacon Mac and cheese.  Both dishes were tasty and had good proportions. Restaurant is nicely decorated and tables are not super crowded. Staff was attentive and efficient."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite as I love HK cafes since they're cheap, filling and satisfying. They are super welcoming, everyone here is smiley and can communicate in both english and cantonese.

Very cute spot with a great chalkboard of deco \"I'm sorry for what I said what I was hungry\" - if this doesn't describe my life, I don't know what does. Their menu isn't huge and I did notice their prices are a few dollars more than regular hk cafes, but still cheap by all means. Everything ranging from $8-12. There are lunch/afternoon specials - I got french toast that was so filling I only ate a bit more than half, and it came with a drink. My boyfriend got chicken wings and fries - the chicken wings seemed over-fried and lacked that bit of grease that gives fried chicken their deliciousness. It was a bit dry and the chicken was small (at least this means they weren't jacked up on steroids in the farm) and the fries were alright, just like the mcdonald's ones. His meal also came with a drink. Together we paid $20 including the tip, which was worth it.

Service and prices are good but I can't see myself coming back all the time as there aren't many vegetarian options and a bunch more different spots in the same area that offer the exact same stuff for a better price."}
{"text":"Price is on the high end compare to other HK Tea places.  Setting is nice and open with outdoor patio option. Food came quick enough but take out box charge 50c each. Not a smart thing to do as customer will only reduce the 50c or more from their tips. Lol"}
{"text":"Mochi Popcorn's Rating Chart
Averaged 5 Star Rating rounded down. 

Overall rating - 3.25 / 5

Time: 6:30pm
Date: Tuesday 
Party: 1
Time to Seat : Instant
Crowd Level : low 

Food / Quality Rating - 3 / 5

1st Dish : Beef skewers grilled with mixed spices. Although large in size, the beef skewers did not stand out in terms of consistent flavor. At times, areas would be overly flavored while others lacked it. Fat content was nice if you enjoy a fatty beef, while you should be wary it will make you thirsty. 

2nd Dish : Yam fries with chipotle mayo. Standard pub fare dish made with a mix of both standard and yam fries. Although the menu did not specify that you would receive mixed fries versus all yam fries, there could be an issue of misleading customers. (More normal fries versus yam) The Chipotle mayo was a tasty dip, but can run out quickly. Nothing over the top here, but it makes a nice snack. 

Portion size was reasonable for both dishes. 

Staff/Service Rating - 3.5 / 5
Given the low crowd level, service staff were able to seat quickly and provide adequate attention when customers request refills/order/check. There was a potential for miscommunication when the server thought I was ordering 3 orders of beef skewers versus 3 beef skewers, but the manager on site stopped by just to confirm which was a nice touch. 

Environment Rating - 3.5 / 5
Service areas for customers are kept clean. Floors and tables are clean when customers sit down. Rear sanitary facilities are fairly standard with no apparent sanitary issues. However loud noise and music can detract from conversation or trying to work. Good for groups that want a nice drink and loud chat. 

Price Rating - 3 / 5
Price after tax and 12% tip - $14.25. Fair pricing given the reasonable portion size."}

Busy little place especially around weekend lunch time.  Parking is ample.  You can take advantage of the outdoor seating during warmer times not all HK cafe have this feature but not much of a view just the parking lot.  Decor is good pretty clean now for the food we had the hunan chicken not bad chicken was good but rice was kind of soft also had the tiger prawn vermicelli counted on three prawns not that big and the plate was generally kind of small these lunches came with tea or coffee cold drink add $1.50"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place. I think about their Hai Nam chicken all day, all night. Having this place relatively close to work, I often drop by for lunch. Their Hai Nam chicken is definitely their best seller, as they often run out of it by 2pm. I've also had their Spaghetti Bolognese, and it too is also very good. This place is definitely one of my favourite HK style spot to hit up in Markham."}
{"text":"I will rate Fav Cafe 3.5/5 stars. Service was excellent. The waiters were very attentive and courteous when we ordered our food. I've tried a few items on the menu and I'd like to highlight:

* PORTUGUESE STYLE BAKED RICE

I really liked this! There is a strong smell of coconut, which I really liked. The Portuguese style sauce and chorizo were the highlight of this meal. The rice itself is fried rice, so even if you eat it without the sauce, it still has taste haha. The sauce actually reminds me of back then when I used to get these Sailor Moon-themed curry powders from the supermarket. #nostalgicmoment hahaha"}
{"text":"We come here pretty regularly for lunch just because it's a rather convenient location from where our offices are. Everyone can get here easily, there's usually no problem parking, and food arrives fairly quickly. 

I normally get the baked dishes here, like the baked pork with rice, which I think is really good. Great portion size for me (left overs for tomorrow!) and good taste. There's just enough acidity in the sauce to keep it from being bland, and it's not too salty. I've tried other dishes as well. The Hainese Chicken with rice is a great one here. If you want it for dinner, you can call early and ask them to save one for you. 

It's a bit more pricey than regular HK Cafe and less options (which isn't always a bad thing considering that you wouldn't want a kitchen that does a bunch of dishes mediocre). I think that for lunch, this is a good spot. For dinner, I think it's over priced. 

Service is good here. Staff are usually quite nice and efficient. 

I think we come here more out of convenience and we all have the 1 or 2 dishes we just keep ordering every time. But given more time, I don't know if this would really be our go to spot. Still, give it a try. It's a good place to go :)"}
{"text":"This is a good little HK style place for lunch! I haven't been disappointed with the food during my two visits. However, I did think it was strange that I was charged for a takeout box to pack my dish that I was not able to finish. Shouldn't it be a restaurant's standard to provide take out boxes free of charge?"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is inviting; earthy tone with natural light shines through the floor-to-ceiling windows.  There is nice background music as well.  Came here with a friend and we had two items on their lunch menu to share: piggy clubhouse sandwich and lotus leaf wrapped fried rice.   There wasn't enough mayo in the sandwich, and it just wasn't a good match with the luncheon meat, ham and bacon; the \"piggy\" ended up dry and salty.   The rice was clumpy and the meat was dry and kind of bland.  Decent service tho!"}
{"text":"The food was tastey but the portions are small. My 13 year old daughter, myself and husband were all still hungry after we finished our meals.
We ordered the curry chicken rice. It was average tasting.
My seafood linguine was really good, they used fresh muscles and shrimp. But portion is small, not enough pasta.
My daughter had the bolognese, it was too dry, lots of ground beef and not enough sauce. The portion also too small.
The drinks were overpriced. $3.25 for a pop, and add $1.50 fee for a cold drink. 
For a hong kong cafe style restaurant, 3 lunch specials for $53 is too much imo.  We could've gone to an all you can eat tbh. 
Also 50cents charge for take out box. That's unheard of for me. The cold drinks, over priced pop and take out box fee all adds up fast."}
{"text":"For lunch, the food tasted A-OK.  

I have been to the Richmond Hill location for both lunch and dinner.  I find the food at dinner time tastes better than lunch time.  Hence, I am not surprised that I find the lunch offering average at this location as well.  Nevertheless, it is good Hong Kong cafe food.  My Baked Tomato Pork Chop tasted sourer than the similar offering at other Hong Kong cafes.  The rice had a nice texture.  The portion was sufficient.  The complementary coffee tasted way better than most Hong Kong cafes'.  It was rich and bold.  The ambience was simple and pleasant.  The services was friendly.  

Fav Cafe is a welcome addition to the area.  I will return to experience dinner.  I hope it is like the Richmond Hill location, where the food at dinner time tastes notably better than lunch time.

Addendum: Made it here for dinner.  Dinner does taste slightly better than lunch.  3.5 stars for dinner"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch around 2pm and the Hai Nam Chicken was sold out. So I opted for the Chicken + Chorizo Portuguese Sauce. The food came fast, however we had to remind them to bring over our hk milk tea. Chicken was tender and portions were average for a Hong Kong Style cafe. Overall, I would definitely come back to try their Hai Nam Chicken"}
{"text":"Pretty much in line with the usual Cha Chan tang stuff. Service is a little slow, but I do expect that for a newly opened place. 

This location is much more spacious than their other location, so sitting here is more comfortable than their other store.

Still no complaints about the food, it is what I expected no more no less.

Pricing is in line with their other store, but priced on the higher end scale for HK style Cha chan tang."}
{"text":"Opens till 11pm. Very clean place.  Nice decor.  Friendly service.  Good alcohol selection,  although my wine came very late. Great menu selection. Great food quality but portions not as generous as regular HK style restaurants. Place a little echoey, so noise level can be high.  Rice is not top grain quality--pretty fragmented.  Price higher than regular HK style restaurants."}
{"text":"2.5

Pros:
Service is good

Cons:
Portions could be better
Not as good as Kiko was

Fav Cafe took over what used to be Kiko.  I really liked Kiko so I was hoping Fav would take the over the torch well.  Sadly, it doesn't. The service is friendly, but that's all it has going compared to Kiko.

When you come in for lunch, you're presented with one sheet for the menu.  The lunch menu consists of 25 entrees/noodle bowls.  That's it.  It's really not much variety compared to other HK style cafes.  If you're coming expecting a lot of the HK style cafe standards, you may be out of luck.  Fav centralizes around fusion of HK style cafes and western dishes.  If this is not your thing, Fav might not be the place to go for you.

We ordered the chicken alfredo and the pork chop and onion sauce on rice.  The food doesn't take too long to come out after ordering.  When the food came out, even before a bite, I knew I wouldn't be impressed too much.  Just by looking at my pics, you can see that the pasta barely had any sauce. My pork chop dish just looked bare.  It was a pork chop on a bowl of rice for $10. I know I'm at a HK style cafe, but it just felt like there should be more.  My little one didn't like the pasta (a rarity) so we ordered a plate of fries and wings for her.  I forgot to take a pic of that, but I think there was something like only 30 fries on the plate.  The portions could of been much better.

I actually liked Fav's first location.  I just feel that the second one could be a lot better.  A little more variety in the menu and better portions could go a long way."}
{"text":"They have an interesting menu, and the concept of the food looks worth the try, but I didn't get to try it because we were seated, but no one came to take our order.  I actually called out to someone, and they walked away.  My brother kept trying to signal different people.  Still no help.    We got up and walked out.    Side note:. I know we're were a party of two, but we were seated right beside someone who occupied a table for 4.  Workable, but not ideal."}
{"text":"Fav cafe replaced kiko which used to be one of my go tos for HK cafe. Even though this is their second location I find that the first location at west beaver creek was better. I've visited this location twice already and tried a lot of new things. I quite enjoyed their baked bolognese dish which I highly recommend. Their nogri(I think that's how it's spelt I don't quite remember), was a bit on the mediocre side. I might eventually update on a review once I try out more dishes. I love the atmosphere and the customer service they provide. Maybe that's why I keep going back. Their crispy crab cake for a starter is also worth a try. The only issue I had with the dish was that it takes forever to be prepared. By the time I was finished with my entree was when the crispy crab cake finally appeared ... 

They also accept all types of payment excluding Amex. 

Definitely worth a try if you're into hk cafe fusion!"}
{"text":"This is the first HK cafe i know of that serves Nasi Goreng. I think this is what they are known for as just about every review I read mentions this dish. I could not blame them, their take of the Malaysian dish is quite delicious it actually gotten a spot in my comfort dishes list. I suspect they use their self made XO sauce on the rice which makes it so fragrant, once you start you just cant stop digging in. I know it took absolute self control and discipline not to eat everything (I'm trying to cut carbs). They also sell this XO sauce @$20 , quite pricey but did buy one to try . I'll update .y review when I've used it , til later !"}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating
For some reason this place doesn't taste as good as the first location. Not sure if it's because I came in the weekend during a busy time.

Piggy's club sandwich ($8.50)
The club sandwich is called piggy because it consists of all pork - bacon, ham, and luncheon meat. I thought I remembered it having pork chop in it but turns out it was luncheon meat instead. I also thought club sandwich would have egg too at least. Comes with either fries or potato salad as a side, and a drink. I chose potato salad but I didn't like the flavor of it.

Nasi Goreng Chicken with rice ($9.95)
Came with two pieces of chicken, broccoli, and fried rice topped with a fried egg and a drink. The fried rice was really good, very flavorful. The chicken skin was really crispy. Decent portion as it had 2 pieces of chicken. The sauce was key."}
{"text":"Good:
1. Ingredients - It's a HK style café that uses unique ingredients you would normally not expect to see.  There's chorizo instead of regular wieners and gemelli pasta instead of spaghetti.

Bad:
1. Execution wasn't great.  I had the baked Portuguese sauce chicken.  It was unevenly heated and the small amount chorizo added nothing to the dish.  It almost felt out of place.  Also didn't like the coconut shavings on top and I felt it ruined the flavour.

Worth it?
Nah.  Prices are too expensive.  I applaud the use of interesting ingredients but if it doesn't taste great, it's not worth another visit."}
{"text":"Fav Cafe and Bar is another Hong Kong style. I like this location better because there are plenty of parking and is closer to 404. The interior is quite spacious and with high ceiling.

The menu is similar to their first location. We ordered:

Nasi Goreng with Chicken ($9.95) Crispy Chicken Skin! Love the spicy and savoury taste. I would order that again

Fish Fillet Baked in Dill Rose Sauce ($11.95) the fried rice was good. However the fish has so much batter and deep fried before baking. Avoid

Food is quite standard and can be a hit or miss. But still worth visiting if you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I didn't like their food. I had Nasi Goreng with Chicken. The food was oily and not fully cooked. Their price is quite high comparing to other HK cafe."}
{"text":"The waitress did not even fake being interested in being our server. You can tell she did not want to be there. Our 2 dishes were okay and nothing special. The price that you pay for the quality is not worth it. Plus, service wasn't good. I did see our server perk up when regulars came in. She was finally laughing and in a jovial mood. I will not be back. My recommendation is to drive further west on Hwy 7 for better and cheaper food."}
