{"text":"The best fried chicken ever. Skin is so crispy and not greasy. The bibimbap is good too, but seriously go for the fried chicken."}
{"text":"Went to the other location in NDG a few times before trying this one. Unfortunately, a lot of the menu items are not available.   We ordered the fried chicken, bibimbap and the seafood tofu soup. Interesting thing is that they gave Seaweed as a side dish which is rare now vs other Korean restaurants in mtl.   The fried chicken is their main thing and it delivers where it counts; tasty and surprisingly not too oily and dry, which is a very good thing. Although I don't eat spicy, I was able to handle the heat. The breading wasn't too thick either so you can actually taste the meat.   The bibimbap came is what looked like a stone bowl but the ingredients definitly were not cooked in it (not sizzling); so something they can improve on. However, it was well balanced and the egg was half cooked/runny enough to stir the bowl.   The tofu soup had the appropriate flavor of what you would expect but a bit more watery vs other places (ganadara's broth is thicker) and has a generous amount of seafood.   Price is about average for Korean food; fried chicken is a tad bit expensive ($19.99 for a full basket)  Be sure to come before 6pm to avoid lineups."}
{"text":"Favorite fried chicken in DT Montreal! Not greasy at all and it has an adequate thickness of batter. Personally I prefer the garlic and soy sauce one, haven't tried other food than fried chicken and rice cake XD."}
{"text":"Excellent! Good food and large portions!  Two of us shared a whole fried chicken and spicy stir-fried pork with rice.  The chicken was hot and well seasoned. The portion was about right. I added the soy+garlic sauce and it was flavorful. The sauce was more on the starchy soy sauce side, with a mild garlic flavor.  But the highlight was the spicy pork. Very flaverful, not salty at all, and has that high-heat flavor. And the portion was mpre than generous.  One star taken off because of the side dishes. We got the cabbage salad, radish salad, bean sprout salad, and cabbage kimchi.  Cabbage kimchi: crunchy and flavorful. Quite good. Bean sprout salad: looked like it was made a week ago. Didn't even touch.  Radish salad: this is supposed to be the soul companion of Korean fried chicken. But their radish was lukewarm, tasteless, and not crunchy at all.  Cabbage salad: just a standard shredded cabbage + mayo/ketchup sauce. Alright.  A better radish salad will certainly improve the dining experience."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken, the service is good. Used to go the one at ndg now I can have it at downtown it's great."}
{"text":"Went for the recommended fried chicken; it was incredibly average.  Service was completely lacking.  Most of the dishes are designed for two people, so either take a large party or make sure your dinner companion wants the same meal as you."}
{"text":"We went here because of the good reviews, but were very disappointed. Kimchi was not really tasty as it should be. Sushi: not tasty. Sweet chicken: not tasty.   We have had far better Korean food in Amsterdam. We were with a group of 3 and independent from each other we had the same opinion."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I loved their food! My favorite were the rice cakes skewers! So good!! Had good service as well wait staff was nice and attentive. The place was packed, which in my book is always a good sign! Come check this place out!"}
{"text":"There are many korean restaurants in Montreal, most serve same types of food, so what makes this place stands out? Their finger licking delicioso fried chickens!!! I grew up loving kfc fried chicken and I always compared fried chickens I have with kfc, and Mon Ami surpasses my expectation, it surpasses my rating scale of kfc! My favorite fried chicken spot! Also, their fried chicken comes in different variety. You can have it standard and with different type of sauce. Their bibimbap is also pretty good. However, I wouldn't remmand the other side dishes as they are pretty average. Just stick to the fried chickens and you'll love it."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my mom.  It was our first meal in Montreal as part of our fun mother-daughter bonding time getaway.  It was a great start to our trip!  We shared the Korean Fried Chicken (half-order $11.99), sweet sauce on the side ($1.99 for 16 oz) and Beef Bulgogi with rice ($10.99).    I liked how they gave us a cold carafe of water as soon as we sat down.  They also brought out some banchan after we ordered.  We got some cubes of daikon radish, some kimchi (which we did not eat), a cabbage slaw topped with what appeared to be thousand island dressing, and some sort of bean sprout dish (that only my mom ate).  These complimentary dishes were ok, but nothing to write home about.  The fried chicken on the other hand was delicious.  So crispy on the outside, yet juicy and tender on the inside.  A half-order gets you 5 pieces.  We got a drumstick, a wing, and 3 smaller pieces that probably altogether equaled one breast.  The dipping sauce was sweet and spicy.  The 16 oz size was perfect for the 5 pieces.  I would order this again anytime.  The beef bulgogi was ok.  It had white onions, green onions, mushrooms and carrots in it along with the beef.  It was a little too wet for my liking and the beef pieces were too small.  The beef was tender though, and it was flavourful.  Too much onions, not enough mushrooms in my opinion.  Service was courteous and efficient.  The place was relatively clean.  I would definitely come back for the fried chicken!!"}
{"text":"Went for the highly rated fried chicken and it didn't disappoint. (For any Chinese people who know what I'm talking about, it's just exactly like the KFC ones in China)  Also ordered that cheese covered rice cake/ramen dish - too salty and greasy unfortunately. If they put half the salt and cheese and more soup to lighten it up it could be a very good dish.  Very young dynamics - young crowd, young servants, radio music, fast food style.. It feels like eating in an Asian cafeteria. Nothing good or bad about it. Just suit your style or mood.  4 stars really only because of the fried chicken. Otherwise 3 stars."}
{"text":"This Korean restaurant is located a couple of blocks away from metro Atwater. They also have another location in NDG on Somerled that I've tried before.  On this location, so far I have only tried their fried chicken and mandu. I have tried various items in the other location and the fried chicken was the only thing that I really liked. The fried chicken was good , perfect crisp , not very oily and slightly spicy. It also comes with a side of  pickled daikon radish in cubes. I was a little upset they did not have fried rice cakes with the fried chicken, they serve it at the NDG location. ..The mandu was very tasty though , crispy and perfectly fried.   They have been open for about a week now and it usually is always busy."}
{"text":"Was very excited to see that what is known as one of the best Korean restaurants in Montreal finally has a location downtown. The menu is not as comprehensive as the one in NDG, but the restaurant is a lot more spacious. There are still however lineups at dinner time.  The service is relatively fast considering the amount of customers. The side dishes included a coleslaw salad, spicy cucumber, kimchi, and radish. Nothing extraordinary. We tried the spicy chicken with cheese, the soybean stew and the rabboki (with cheese).   My favorite our of the three was by far the soybean stew. It was the most flavourful soybean stew I've had in Montreal. It's a little spicy (even though there is no indication on the menu) which made it even better. I'd give it 9/10 just because it is vegetarian. A little meat would make it 11/10.   The spicy chicken with cheese was very good, but what disappointed me was that it was not representative of the picture in the menu: the portion seems smaller in reality, and there were no veggies, just chicken and cheese. A lot of cheese. A little too much to my taste.  The rabboki also had a lot of cheese. It was supposed to be a mix of ramen and rice cakes, but I felt like it was more 4/5 ramen and 1/5 rice cakes. It was also not as spicy as I would've liked it.  Three dishes was more than enough for two famished people. We even brought back some leftover. However, it might also have been because we had two dishes with A LOT of cheese, so it kinds of cuts the appetite pretty quick. I would suggest not ordering more than 1 cheese dish for two people at a time.   The price is not too bad, except for the chicken which was 25$. The portion and ingredients were not worth 25$ for sure. But I would definitely go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Great fried chicken; batter is light enough and not too greasy, with a slight spicy taste to it.  Generous portions (half portion of fried chicken was way enough for me).  Seafood udon was also very tasty, but somewhat greedy on the amount of seafood (two shrimps and a couple of mussels...). Not too spicy."}
{"text":"We obviously came for the fried chicken (soooo gooood), but also tried the Bulgogi Bibimbap and Rabboki. First came the four side dishes - gamja, coleslaw, pickled sweet daikon and pickled garlic cabbage.   The main dishes came incredibly fast. I'd say in less than 10 mins? Granted, we were probably the only table to serve at that point of the night, but it was still pretty amazing. The fried chicken was, of course, delicious. I think it might actually be my favorite, aside from Mary Brown's. The crust is fragrant, thin and crisp, the meat is favorful and moist, and the whole thing is neither greasy nor dry. The bibimbap came piping hot. The egg had an intensely orange yolk and the beef had great flavor. My boyfriend, who hadn't had a good bibimbap since he left Toronto, was finally happy: he pretty much inhaled the whole thing. My Rabboki had a thick layer of cheese all over the ramen noodles, rice cakes and other goodies. Although it was decently spicy, it was also soaking in sauce, which after awhile felt way too salty and slightly off putting. The rice cakes were really on point though. In the end, I couldn't finish half of the Rabboki, but ate instead both servings of rice and all of the side dishes, which made me more than satisfied. The potatoes and cabbage were my favorites - I should really pickle more at home!  We'll definitely come back for the chicken, and also to try some of the other tasty-looking dishes. Prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Ordered the sweet chicken and the regular fried chicken and even though both were half portions, Adam and I definitely had enough to go around. A half portion is 5 pieces but some are bigger than others. The server made it sound like 5 pieces wasn't going to be enough so we ordered ramen to share too. We would've been fine without but I loved getting to try it. The noodles and broth were great!   The fried chicken was nice and crispy without being too dry or too wet. It has the perfect amount of crunch and flavour. I didn't get any sauce but I imagine if you had the right one it'd be amazing.   Adam's sweet chicken was fried chicken but with a sweet and sour sauce. A bit like general tao but with fried chicken. Very good.   When they serve you the chicken they also give you a little bin for the bones! So thoughtful and considerate.   They give you three little entrees before your chicken arrives. White radish, coleslaw with Big Mac sauce, and some cabbage with seasoning (my guesses).   This place really exceeded my expectations. I would recommend it for lunch."}
{"text":"The fried chicken here is great, and the cook on it was perfect when I visited. I love the crispness, and the slight spice to the original fried chicken, I could easily eat several pieces if I let myself. In addition to that, our party had the kimbap with bulgogi, spicy tteokbokki with cheese, and kimchi pancake. The pancake was my second favorite item, with the bottom being crispy and the sourness of the kimchi coming through. The banchan is basic, but they gave us additional pickled daikon when asked. Although every dish came out separately and the service was kind of slow, it was courteous and professional.  This is a great option for lunch or a casual dinner, I look forward to digging through the menu further."}
{"text":"Very good Korean place with tasty dishes, I would definitely recommend it as one of the good restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Would defiantly recommend! Very nice staff! I jut didn't give it a 5 because I have high standards for a 5. Food was good I guess haven't been to many Korean places so I cannot really tell."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place with all the reviews about great fried chicken. Unfortunately while they do get some things right the chicken leaves much to be desired. The batter is light and crispy, based on it alone I would have given 5 stars. Unfortunately it could definitely use more seasoning. The chicken itself was dry almost to the bone, which basically takes all the good batter points away. Near the bones some of the meat was \"in the zone\" where it was still moist....but that was only a small little piece on the inside. I also tried the rice cakes which was something I never tried. They are ok I guess the sauce was basically a ketchup with a bit of heat. Also some deep fried shrimp which were ok but the size of shrimp compared to the batter was not a good ratio...almost all batter.   On the positive side the service was great . My youngest was in a rotten mood and they went as far as coming over to play with her in an effort to settle her down.   I just wish the food had hit the mark as well as the service. Perhaps good fried chicken at restaurants is just not something that is easily found.   If 3.5 stars was an option I would use it as I want to go higher than 3 but can't justify a 4."}
{"text":"You know when a store does well, it opens up another location, and there's a good reason why.  The food is good Korean fare, especially for those who don't want to do the lineup at GaNaDaRa. The portions are good sized and prices not too bad. I would have to say that their banchan (Korean entrées) wasn't that impressive at all.  With only 2 dishes, the kimchi didn't seem to be very well pickled and the scoop of mashed potato left something to be wanted. That being said, the rice cakes had a nice crispy exterior and chewy and was also piping hot.  The mandu (dumplings) were a bit small but they were nice and crispy.  I wanted to order the fried chicken but they didn't have single portions so that'll have to be for another time.  The main dishes were flavourful and hot, especially the ones served in the stone bowls. I usually try the bibimbap from all the different Korean restos as a point of reference. If Masterchef Canada could make it a dish worthy of competition, it's simple looking but difficult to make well and balanced in flavours and ingredients, then it's worth comparing it against others. I found the rice to be plain and not the fancier purple rice that other Korean restos use and the egg a little too done, but otherwise the variety was there as well as presentation. Another would be the pork bone soup (next on my list).  Overall, it's conveniently located, it's tasty and it'll answer the Korean food fix most people crave."}
{"text":"I really had high expectation for this place, and really wanted to give a good review, but objectively this place is just a 3 stars.  I tasted a bit of everything on the menu and only the fried chicken and teokbokki are good in my opinion. - fried chicken: best fried chicken, better than basak in my opinion. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The flavor is just right, a good amount of salty and spicy. Just perfect. I keep coming back for it. - teokbokki: thin sweet crisp on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. The sauce is not spicy at all, it is actually sweet, but not overly sweet. Just right. - japchae: really bad... The noodles are too thin and a bit hard, and they are all sticked together (maybe they should have put more sesame oil). The flavor was dull, there was not enough vegetables, so I was basically just chewy a bunch of hard bland glass noodles with a tiny amount of onions and red peppers.  - soondubu: it is one of my favorite korean dish, and its probably the worst I've had so far... There was barely any tofu inside even though the dish is literally called soft tofu stew...They put a lot of seafood, but they look and taste just like the frozen mixed seafood pack that you can buy in the supermarket... So I would rather have more tofu and no seafood.   Maybe I am just unlucky and picked all the bad choices, so I will still try some other dishes. However their fried chicken and teokbokki are excellent! Must try!"}
{"text":"I had to return to try their fried chicken! It was so good and so crunchy. Way better than KFC as it's fresh and chicken was tender too. For Korean food, their fried chicken was delicious and they also give a side of coleslaw with their spicy mayo which also added a twist. The service was great and I'd definitely recommend it to all if you're in town and want to give it a shot especially their fried chicken. I also liked the presentation of their foods as they placed the fried chickens in newspaper style and in the basket. I found it cute and unique! It wasn't too pricy so overall, great service and good fried chicken quality."}
{"text":"I've had the popular fried chicken at Mon ami in Somerled. Tender and juicy! I've decided to give a try to the one in downtown St-Cath. but unfortuntely it wasn't the same when i ordered it. The chicken was dry and had to dip into the sauce to our sweet mustard sauce to actually taste something... maybe they had a bad chicken day!  On the other side, i've had the rice cakes as well and it was good. Always full of people, the place is well situated in the heart of downtown and near concordia uni."}
{"text":"After a few recommendations to go there, I was blown away. Everything we ordered was delicious. For my full review, check out: https://therealmtlfoodie.wordpress.com/2018/03/28/hands-down-my-fave-korean-food-in-montreal-is-at-mon-ami/"}
{"text":"Came for the fried chicken and sure wasn't disappointed! I was with a friend who really, I mean REALLY, can't tolerate spicy foods so she was a bit worried since Korean food is known for that. In my opinion, the original fried chicken wasn't spicy at all, but my friend still found the seasoning a little hot. The breading was crispy and not greasy with juicy chicken (mostly white meat).   Besides that we ordered the corn with cheese, steamed dumplings which were a hit and tteokbokki. All of it was pretty good. We had plenty of food for 3 people and the bill came out to be less than $17 each.   Some items on the menu seem to be highlighted in different colors, but it actually means they aren't available. We were a bit confused by it before asking our waiter."}
{"text":"Very good fried chicken!  Crispy and not too greasy, other Korean food is very authentic as well."}
{"text":"Amazing fried chicken! Perfect with a cold beer. The chicken isn't the only good thing, the kimchi jigae, bibimbap, ramen, pajeon... They're all worth a try!"}
{"text":"This is my 1st time going there and I have to say that I'm impressed with their fried chicken! Wow that was good! Tender inside and chrispy outside. Well cooked and the pieces were big! Loved it!  We were two, and we got there around 6pm. It's in a very busy spot of downtown Montreal, so don't expect this place to be calm anytime soon. They gave us a seat pretty fast when we got there, so that was good.   The place was fun, the seats with fabrics were all ripped. And they added a throw on them, I guess to hide them, but it was still odd. None the less, I didn't care because I was here for my fried chicken! Hahahah! And I also got a Ramen bulgogi : really good! The beef was well cooked and the Ramen was really tasty!   If you don't like the crowd, don't go there, it's loud and and always busy. But there are other locations in town."}
{"text":"Great korean place to eat in downtown! Awesome fried chicken if you are ready to eat some great non greasy fried chicken, mon ami is the right place for everyone. The service is usually very quick even most often the restaurant is very busy."}
{"text":"I came here many times and I really like the beef bibimbap (hot stone pot). It's pretty standard, but has more meat then other restaurants that offer this dish. The side dishes I got was kimchi and this sour seaweed. They were really good but i was with a group of 5 people so feels strange to receive that as our sides. Normally, Korean restaurants offer 4 different sides for a group of 5 people. So if that could change it would be great! Anyways a side from that, the restaurant is clean and the service is fast."}
{"text":"It was really a fun evening. Went with 6 friends on prime dinner time Saturday and there was a wait for about 15 minutes. Not bad.. Huge portions and pretty reasonably priced Korean food! Tried the pork and kimchi stew. It was idyllic for a wintery evening! Vegetable dumplings were great too! The boneless chicken was nothing special though.. Nevertheless very busy ambiance and good for groups. Quick efficient service and good food! Will definitely visit again to try other things on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Resto introduit pas une collègue coréenne. On retrouve les spécialités coréennes comme le buldoki (désolée pour l'orthographe), bibimbab, nouille etc et surtout leur fameux poulet frit. J'ai personnellement trouver le poulet trop sec, pas assez tendre. Le reste était plutôt sympa. Le service est correcte, la salle est propre. J'y retournerais sûrement."}
{"text":"One of my go-to Korean restaurants! Great for families and groups. Fair warning, there are usually line ups during dinner time, but the wait time is much shorter the smaller your group is.   Me and my friends usually order their fried chicken, which they are known for, kimchi fried rice, hot stone bibimbap and jeyuk bokkeum! Their fried chicken is delicious and worth the hype, the fried rice is very flavourful and a great portion and the stir fried pork (jeyuk) is spicy but packed with flavour. The portions are great for sharing, and priced very well. They also give you free sides such as pickled radish, kimchi and coleslaw.  All in all, great Korean food and great prices!! The only con would have to be the wait time for supper, especially during the weekend and for groups of 4+."}
{"text":"It was the worst experience I had in Montreal. No air conditioner, bad service.  We celebrated my friend's birthday at Mon Ami. We asked some plates for the birthday cake. A waitress(A) brought to us. After we paid, another waitress(B) just came and took the plates from my friend's hands without any words. Then, she just dropped six plastic plates on our table and asked us to bring plates next time. Her action was so rude and without respect.    Thank for giving us shit on my friend's birthday. I would never ever again visit this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Worst service experience I ever have. The Short black hair waitress showed me what is disrespecting. After I paid their tips (15%), that waitress ignored me and my friends. We asked for dishes to share our birthday cake. She came to our table and taught us \"next time, bring dishes by yourself\". I wished I could have a good time with my friends in Mon aim, but their service ruined everyone mood. No matter how their food is, I suggest people make another choice if you do not want to be disrespected and ignored."}
{"text":"The flavoured sous here are amazing!! We always find ourselves back here for a drink once in a while. The cheese Tteok-bokki () is incredibly delicious, and so is their fried chicken. :)"}
{"text":"Best bulgogi bibimbap in town and fried chicken is their specialty. Friendly staff. Love it"}
{"text":"Love the sweet fried chicken. The sauce is wonderful. Plus, the BBQ is super cheap, and tasty. yah I am a huge fan. And the owner is lovely."}
{"text":"This is KFC heaven. I mean Korean Fried Chicken. Now I don't have to head over to NDG anymore and can get it right in the Western fringes of downtown. The service is friendly and super quick. The fried chicken is amazing, slightly spicy coating mix, fried and surprisingly light while the meat inside (mostly white) is moist and favorful, not dried out at all.  If you ask for a half-order, you get maybe about 5 small pieces and it comes with coleslaw (the Korean version) and picked sweet daikon radish cubes. Get the soy-garlic dipping sauce and you're good to go.  I saw lots of other Korean dishes go by and they all looked really good and practically all the tables in the front were full for a Saturday lunch! They seem to cater to the Asian students coming in from Corcordia and Dawson but I did see specials posted for a whole order of fried chicken with pitchers of Sapporo beer for $29.99, which sounds more like a tailgate special for jocks but what do I know?"}
{"text":"different than i would of thought, my soondubu was tasty and the tofu was velvety but the kimchi isn't good tastes raw, they used a different cabbage not the nappa cabbage. The fried chicken for 2$ a piece is not impressive, the place's air is very bad, they should change the exhaust."}
{"text":"If you go with a group of 14 people, they can all fit in here. Food was great, lots of choices, representative of the Korean cuisine. I noticed there were a lot of Koreans coming here to eat! That MUST mean something right??? It's like a Vietnamese going to a pho restaurant to eat pho! Their kimchi is less spicy I think, so it's perfect for those who want to try kimchi but are too scared to try spicy food. But if you eat to much, it will get hot in there!!!"}
{"text":"Mon ami has become my winter go-to restaurant whenever I don't feel like cooking in the evening. The dishes are affordable and the food is always good. Even though everyone loves the fried chicken, I really enjoy their stews and bibimbap. The banchan are tiny portions and leave much to be desired but the service is always friendly and swift. I think it is the perfect restaurant for a group of four who would like to share different dishes."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean Restaurant at downtown.  The food tastes good, friendly and nice service. Happy every time I come here"}
{"text":"Restaurant Mon ami provided the worst service I have ever had in Montreal! The service person who has short black hair was not polite. I liked the food here but I won't go to this restaurant from now on because of their impolite service and unfriendly environment. My friend brought a birthday cake here thinking of celebrating her birthday after the meal. We asked for plates and forks, and one of their service persons brought it to us. Suddenly, another service person who is a girl with black short hair directly took away those plates from my hand ( I was waiting for the service person to clean up the table)without any explanation! When she came back, she threw back some plastic plates to our table and said that we don't provide extra plates for cake as we don't have cake in the restaurant. Wow wow wow! When we brought the cake to the restaurant, I asked the service person to store it in the refrigerator and told her we wanted to have cake after meal. She can told me now if they don't allow customers to have their own cakes here or told me that they asked for extra service fee. I totally can understand if there is a rule or extra fee for customer's own cake. But they didn't tell anything about the cake. Then after the meal, I asked them if they can bring the cake to the table and provided us extra plates and knife for the cake, they didn't say anything about their rules or anything like that. How could they just took away plates from my hand then and threw plastic plates to our table just like we didn't tell them before ahead that we gonna have the cake here. I won't go to this restaurant any more and won't recommend it to my friends."}
