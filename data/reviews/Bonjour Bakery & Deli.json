{"text":"New ownership!!  The Bonjour Bakery & Deli, now with a Korean twist, is a wonderful addition to the Las Vegas Valley's selection of Bakeries.  The best Baguette outside of France and delicious Croissants, not to mention the pastries.  I have been there numerous times since it's soft opening and always new delicacies to try.  Service is so friendly and the place is absolutely spotless and very inviting."}
{"text":"I was in the area and saw this place on Yelp and figured it was worth a try.  I was craving a croissant and thought if a French bakery doesn't have the best croissants, no one would.  I went around lunch time and there were only two others in the place.  The first thing I noticed was how super hot it was. Not sure if the a/c was off or what. The lady at the counter was very friendly and I'd give her all the stars in the world. After I ordered my ham and cheese croissant the lady came over to let me know that they didn't have any croissants. What?!?!  French bakery and no croissants.  Hmm...ok.  I ended up having the ham and cheese on the baguette.  It was pretty good.  The baguette was fresh and was a good alternative.  However, at this point I'm still head scratching as to why no croissants at noon on a weekday. The side salad was ok.  It had those little baby corns like Tom Hanks eats in the movie \"Big.\"  I'm not a fan of the little corns but that's ok.  I opted out of having a dessert even though they looked good.  I was still hung up on the no croissant deal. I'm unsure if I want to try this place again."}
{"text":"Lovely new owners. JUST reopened.  Still a quaint high quality French bakery and cafe and so much better than the previous owners who let it go. I love stopping by in the afternoon for a coffee and pastry. The coffee is a an amazing European brand.  Excellent customer service and very attentive.  They are adding new items everyday it seems."}
{"text":"They changed the ownership and hiked up their prices.  I don't think their croissants are worth $4.  Too bad because I don't think they will stay in business for long. The place was dead when I was there."}
{"text":"I have been passing by this place every time I go to Sprouts, and today I decided was the day I would go in! I was greeted by a beautiful, vibrant woman named Elisa who greeted me in French (as she thought I was French) very sweet. She offered me some of the cakes they had as samples on the counter, I can't remember what they were...but oh they were so delightful! I ordered a ham and cheese croissant that came with a salad; I asked for the pomegranate vinaigrette. I must say...WOW! I literally giggled after taking my first bite of the croissant! So perfectly crafted! The vinaigrette was the perfect balance of bitter and sweet.  I ate practically ever crumb on my plate! It was such a beautiful day, the sun shining into the shop put an extra layer of dazzle of the day. They play a beautiful mix of music which is very important to me!  I will absolutely be returning, thank you for being a sunshine spot in this world! Merci beaucoup!"}
{"text":"New management has totally upgraded this little local bakery! Two sisters run this shop, with one in the front of house and one in the kitchen. The partnership works excellently, with tasty food served with attentive and genuinely caring service. The dining room itself is clean, bright, and nicely decorated, with art on display and available for sale. I've been in twice and am already on a first-name basis with Kristin!  The bakery case is always full of beautiful desserts, but I tend to come here for lunch. The ham and cheese croissant is a good classic, and you can add an egg to make it even more indulgent. Their Korean fusion dishes with bulgogi come especially recommended and the burger I ordered had so much flavor! Their coffee drinks are super strong and well balanced, made with Lavazza. It's hard not to pop in every time I go grocery shopping in this plaza."}
{"text":"The coffee and almond croissants taste as good or better than any I've had on the Champs-Élysées in Paris  Magnificent place and a wonderfully, beautiful owner.  Can't wait to come back next weekend"}
{"text":"I liked it the first time i was there.My second visit was not so nice.The store smelled like Sewage ,and the pastries looked dry and old.I don't think that i will return any time soon."}
{"text":"Hi everyone! Needed to let you know about the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant. It made sous vide way... IT WAS AMAZING!! Kristin,thank you for the recommendation."}
{"text":"Much inproved, super nice owner. They do French pastry with a Swedish Korean twist. You can really taste the freshness. Some places it's so stale, and they have the audacity to call themselves a bakery. This is old school legit"}
{"text":"Such a cute little spot with a relaxing atmosphere. Delicious and beautiful little desserts and amazing coffee. Great place for breakfast, brunch, or lunch with menu items like omelets, crepes, soups, salads and sandwiches. Added bonus they had vegetarian and vegan options. The owners are friendly and provide great customer service."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT choice for coffee and a sweet treat or a wonderfully fresh lunch. Other than Freed's Bakery across town, this is the only place I have found where every offering is a delicious choice! Come hungry and enjoy every bite!"}
{"text":"Meet up with friend to talk. I always love this place because so quite. We had our talk, our coffee and some sweets with their great service ofcourse. My place to go to if I don't want to be bother."}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning for an Americano and Croissant.  Everything was great.  Service was excellent as well.  Girl working was very nice and pleasant, not to mention beautiful as well!!  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Went by today got 3 croissants and hot chocolate my mother in law loved the chocolate croissants she ate 2 and I had the almond croissant it was delicious and the hot chocolate was very good as well. Friendly service and the prices are pretty good. I think this will be a regular stop from now on."}
{"text":"My mom and I came here the other day and shared a ham and cheese crepe with a side salad that was amazing! The ambiance is so lovely and quaint, and the service was unbeatable. We had delicious samples of all of their different cakes and pastries, then enjoyed a matcha latte. I absolutely will come back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very disappointed drove all the way here and it's 8:15 am and Yelp clearly said it was open at 8 am. Get here and the woman in there didn't open and their signs says 9am on their door. Why post wrong info on Yelp, never coming back mad I drove here for nothing"}
{"text":"The new owners of this long extant bakery have true Swedish roots.  Their Swedish Princess Cake, special-ordered, had homemade marzipan and was to perfection.  Almond croissants delicious!  Thanks Christine!"}
{"text":"I am so glad this is under new ownership! This bakery is in the same shopping center as Sprouts and CVS on Flamingo and Rainbow. It's a Korean Swedish fusion with a French ambience! Super cute little bakery with great food and pastries! I came in on a Tuesday afternoon with my boyfriend before we went to buy groceries! Pro tip - always eats before buying groceries so you don't buy everything! It's right next to Myloan nails. When you walk in you see the menu on a big chalkboard behind the register. Everything is organic and made by the owner! She was so sweet! The music was French and soft,it made you feel like you weren't in a shopping center but rather a cafe in Paris! It was a little bit later in the afternoon so we decided on lunch. The menu had croissants,sandwiches and bulgogi burgers and noodles! We ordered the burger and the noodles! They were both a 10! The owner makes this dressing that's sweet and spicy and you pour it over the noodles or salad it was so good. You can also buy jars of this sauce, I recommend getting some for salads at home! The flavors of everything stood out it was delicious! Definitely will be  returning to eat here and try everything!"}
{"text":"I love this spot! The food is delicious and the customer service is outstanding. The employees take great pride in their business and it shows. How wonderful it is to visit a restaurant and feel so welcome from the moment you walk in! I would highly recommend visiting Bonjour if you are looking for a quiet and convenient brunch, lunch, or quick coffee option. It was a perfect place for me to meet a friend visiting town without the hustle and bustle of other breakfast restaurants. The chocolate almond croissant was my favorite. Additionally the employees were so good with my busy one-year-old, and that alone makes me want to return again and again."}
{"text":"Tough location for Bonjour in a grocery shopping center off Rainbow and Flamingo. But if you don't miss it, you'll find a solid local sandwich stop. Super friendly service with opportunity to sample some free pastries. For under $10 you can get multiple sandwiches which come with a very fresh salad with collard greens, peppers, and baby corn sprinkled in - very refreshing when a complimentary side salad is more than green lettuce from a grocery store. The baguette was fine for my ham and cheese sandwich but wasn't the best in town. Still, a nice option for lunch in the area. They have an outdoor seating area as well as a half dozen tables inside. I might give this local place a go and try a crepe or an interesting bulgogi burger which is enticingly interesting for a French bakery."}
{"text":"If you want the closest thing to authentic French pastries and light fare, it doesn't get better than Bonjour Bakery. The Chef/Owner is one of the best French chefs in Vegas. He is sticking to his guns on authenticity of his menu as opposed to adapting for American preferences. Try the baguette sandwiches, they are to die for."}
{"text":"Picked up sandwiches and pastries for a trip to Red Rock Nature Conservancy. Great stuff - we liked it all. Croissant and baguette sandwiches, included salad with house- made dressings, a napoleon, pumpkin pastry, cookies. Other park visitors coveted our lunch. They display case included a pretty wide variety of pastries, too. Plus, the owner threw in a little lagniappe in the form of a few extra cookies. They treat you right!"}
{"text":"One of my Facebook friends mentioned Bonjour Bakery & Deli so I bookmarked it last week.  Today I was in the neighborhood and decided to stop in.  Before I start there are two things you should know: 1. 3 weeks in Lyon, France more or less ruined me on French food in the United States.  Who knew something as simple as bread and butter could be so much better! 2. I stopped in about 2:30PM and didn't feel like hanging around so just got a couple of things To-Go.  I got the two things I remember being so common and so much better in France....  A chocolate croissant and a baguette.  The croissant didn't make it home and there are little flakes of it in my car.  (I never eat in my car!)  I mentioned the time of day because every time I had a croissant in France, it was in the morning.  It was a tiny bit less melt in your mouth than in France  but I'll bet that's only because it wasn't fresh out of the oven and still warm like the first batch of the day.  It was definitely best I've had in Vegas so far.  I haven't tried the bread yet but hopefully it's equally good.  (Note: I did confirm croissants are made with French butter... which is also better than typical American butter!)  The young woman was pleasant and helpful and as it turns out, actually from France...and of course tall, thin and beautiful.... life is so unfair!  The seating area is pretty small.  I didn't count the tables but maybe six??  They had quite a few savory items on the menu and a kitchen behind the counter which I didn't really look at since I was focused on the contents of the glass case.  I will be going back to try the French Burger because, yes, the best hamburger I ever had was also in France!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this cute shop while waiting for my oil change and fell in love with the decor, vibe, and warm staff! I will definitely be coming back to study and eat here. The iced tea and dessert were delicious. I can't wait to try more of their items!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ordered a Ham and Cheese Baguette (~$8), which comes with a small salad. I also got an almond croissant and coffee. Now the sandwich was great, the bread was especially delicious, but I think the almond croissant (~$4) was the star of my meal. It's probably one of the best almond croissants I've ever had and I order those wherever I can find them. They make their own almond paste, import their butter from France, and get their flour from Europe. They make a point to bake their goods from scratch and the quality is obvious from how it tastes. Definitely going to order more of these in the future and maybe also try the almond chocolate croissant that they offer. As for the coffee, they use Lavazza coffee, which is a good, strong Italian coffee. I'm not an espresso person, but they offer espressos in single and double shot as well.   The interior is clean and when you walk in, you immediately see the window of pastries and cakes directly ahead, fresh bread on the shelf, and a huge chalkboard menu showcasing their options for drinks, sandwiches, breakfasts, savory crepes, and more. There are about 5-6 tables inside and I think 2 tables outside (mostly see people choose the outside for smoking or because they have a dog). The service here was top notch and the two sisters who run it seem really passionate about the place. One of them is from Sweden and speaks five languages, which I thought was awesome.   When Bonjour first opened under its original owners, I absolutely loved this place. Then there was a second owner and the quality seemed to go down while the prices went up. At a certain point, I stopped coming to Bonjour altogether. Thanks to Yelp I found out that Bonjour was yet again under new management, so I went to check it out. Now, the third/current owners (the two sisters mentioned above) are looking to put their own spin on the place while keeping a lot of the traditional French offerings without sacrificing quality. All in all, I'm glad Bonjour is back. It's a great place to grab a coffee and a meal/pastry. They're making some new breads too, some of which are very brioche-like. I'll definitely be back in the future to try out some of their new creations."}
{"text":"Our airbnb host suggested this charming bistro for breakfast. we went for lunch. we can only hope the owner gets tired of the heat and relocates  to New Jersey . Creative  menu of omelets, quiche, crepes and sandwiches, great selection of hot and cold drinks, and terrific pastries. Warm friendly service, a real neighborhood gem. Go."}
{"text":"\"Little town, it's a quiet village Every day like the one before Little town, full of little people Waking up to say: Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!\"   Bonjour was a pleasant experience from the moment I enter this small bakery in the corner of a busy shopping plaza. Its been years I haven't been to this bakery because I had a few bad experience from the previous owners. However, the change in owners and staff made a big difference on this particular visit. Thanks to Renee N. for the recommendation that I should try them out again. Everything I had was delicious, especially the Ham & Cheese Croissant with a side salad. The croissant was soft in the inside and flakey on the outside overall it had a good texture to it. It wasn't overcooked. The ham and cheese were equally consistent and paired well with the croissant. The Pumpkin cake, was balanced in sweetness and not too bland. I would come back for this particular pastry. I got a chocolate and almond croissant to go and they were both up to par especially the almond croissant. I will return to try out more of the items offered at this unique bakery in the future.  FYI: The owner is a Korean lady from Sweden, who speaks multiple languages.  2017 Yelp Review #51"}
{"text":"So happy that my neighborhood bakery has gotten new owners. At first, I doubted the authenticity of a Korean-French fusion bakery. I was so very wrong. This store has improved ten-fold.  As hard as I try not to, I always end up stopping by for their tasty slices of cake. The lychee one is delicious! Subtle & sweet.  I also stock up on croissants, which are even better- mainly their almond croissant! They have a great variety- coconut, pumpkin, chocolate & almond, or plain butter.  I have yet to try their lunch/sandwich offerings but I cannot wait to do so."}
{"text":"The chocolate/almond croissant is spectacular (the coconut croissant must be great, too)! Charming little bistro that really knows how to make a real croissant and cafe au lait. I almost wish I lived in Las Vegas so I could come back. (Why does anyone live in Las Vegas? It's a depraved, vulgar and ugly city. It's bad enough to visit here, although there is a lot of good food). The quiche, crepe and salad menu looks great, and probably is, considering the care and skill they put into the baked goods."}
{"text":"Bonjour bakery has now re-opened under new ownership! I've been here twice so far since the re-open and both experiences were very pleasant.  The new owners(two sisters) are extremely nice and welcoming. The inside of the bakery looks neat and clean (A/C is functioning now).  Lots of new pastries to choose from. My favorite so far has to be the eclair cake; it's the most scrumptious pastry i have tried. Also, the almond croissant  is always a delicious classic cappuccino companion, and the new owners always have plenty on hand. Also tried a \"Swan\" creampuff (see my photos) It was a citrus choux pastry filled with cream, also a tasty and unique treat! Cappuccino was also smooth and potent! Overall, loving this bakery so far! It's our new go-to spot for sit-in coffee n pastry. Wish them all the best!"}
{"text":"Helpful Tip: Under NEW management*  Opted for a danish instead of a traditional croissant with a little persuasion from the new new owners of Bonjour bakery! Excellent choice by the way. This light pastry was fresh and scrumptious! Definitely one of the better \"French\" bakeries I've been to around town. I'll definitely be back soon to experience some of the renovations the new owners shared!!"}
{"text":"I came with my SO on a Saturday afternoon and ordered a regular coffee, a macchiato, a chocolate almond croissant and a chocolate croissant. Everything was in the European style, delicious, artisanal, pleasing to the eye and very fresh.   I sampled a number of the cakes on offer for sample and the strawberry lava cake was especially appealing, but ultimately I'm happy we went with croissants instead of the cake.   The hospitality of the owner, Kristin, was inviting and her presence was impressive. I am so happy to live down the road from this gem."}
{"text":"Always looking to try a new French cafe and this place caught my eye one afternoon.  It is located in a strip mall at the corner of Flamingo and Rainbow Blvd. it is a little hidden so just look for  the sign.   When we walked in we were greeted by the lovely owner. The menu features French and Korean choices which I was surprised to see based on the name of the cafe. I ordered a ham/cheese croissant and hubby ordered the Croque Madam. Each entree came with a side of delicious organic greens and veggies. They were just delicious and so fresh. My croissant was tasty but hubby's sandwich was just ok. We then enjoyed some conversation with another one of the gals working there. The surroundings are a couple tables for two and a four top. The cafe features various local artists works and many are for purchase.   In addition, I purchased a couple of chocolate croissants and a baguette. All of my purchases were delicious.  Overall we enjoyed our experience and although it was not the best French lunch we ever had, the warmth and friendliness of the owner and staff makes me want to come back."}
{"text":"This is a great hidden gem here in this shopping center!! Im always looking for some nice spots to sit back, relax and enjoy some good food. The staff is very nice and make you feel welcomed. Great choice of pastries and savory plates. I will make this one of my go to spots when im in this area of town. Love verything about this place."}
{"text":"Nice, small coffeeshop/bakery. The latte was good and the chocolate-orange breadpudding is tasty. Customer service is A+: the woman (one of the owners, I think) who was working was extra attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"The new owners have ruined the baked goods.  The chocolate croissant was good but tasted like it was made with frozen dough.  The menu looks good but I didn't try anything but the croissant and caffe mocha.  The coffee was excellent.  This in top of the owner and chef sitting at a table with a sales rep selling premade pastries and they actually ordered some.  I'll be back for the coffee and sandwiches but not the croissant or baguette"}
{"text":"The location is under new ownership, and having not visited before, I have nothing to compare it too. I'm absolutely fine with that though, because Bonjour Bakery & Deli was an absolute delight.  I wanted a place to pop in for a quick breakfast and a coffee while I got some work done. They are located in a big shopping center, so there is parking aplenty. I walked in to be greeted by a pastry case of the finest treats. They have a large chalkboard menu, and some of their more savory breakfast options include omelettes, croque monsieur, and a ham and cheese croissant. And fear not. They still make the famous almond croissant that I heard nearly every guest order while I sipped my almond milk latte.  This isn't the place where you're going to get fancy latte art, but I enjoyed the creaminess of the dairy alternative and the smooth flavor of their espresso. I devoured my ham and cheese croissant. They fly their butter in from France, and you can taste the difference as the flaky pastry dances across your tongue. The side salad that accompanied was a forest of vegetables with a champagne vinaigrette.  What really caught my eye was how warm and welcoming the staff and owner were to every guest. They were greeted with either a warm smile or a warm hug. You can tell that they are really trying to build a community and take pride in what they do.   This was a little reminder and taste of my time in France, merci!"}
