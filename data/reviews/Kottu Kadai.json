{"text":"Very Good Kottu Rotti here - the Rotti is very soft and tasty
I kept some in the fridge and heated in the microwave 4 days later and it tasted even better
Mutton Kottu or Chicken Kottu are my favorites"}
{"text":"Tried the kothu roti from here for the first time this year, and it is definitely the best kothu I have ever tasted! Tried the chicken, chilli chicken, and shrimp kothu, and the chicken and shrimp are my favourite! The kothu roti is also physically appealing as it's finished off with onion, tomato, and a fried egg on the top. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really good asthetic looking food! I got the roles, vadais and mixed rice. The roles and vadais were perfectly circles I was really impressed with the details! 

The taste of the food was really good as well. The roles were crunchy and a good mix of spices. It was really good. The rice was okay, it was mixed with a variety of vegetables. 

Prices are high, altogether was 20$, for 4 roles, 3 vadais, and a small box of rice. 

I went around 1pm and it was pretty empty, only 2 other customers. 

They don't have a great variety of things, majority of their stuff is mixed. I just wanted simple rice but they didn't have since they had everything mixed. The person in front was really nice and soft spoken."}
{"text":"Be prepared for atleast an hour or longer wait!

I ordered an hour ahead and they said it would be a 40 minute wait, so we switched our order to make it faster. Once we got there they asked us to wait another 10-15 minutes because they were busy.  So we waited, almost 20 minutes passed and we still didn't get our order. We were pretty upset at this point and had to cancel our order because there is no way we were going to wait 2 hours for kotthu rotti!

I was not prepared to wait for that long for kotthu rotti, especially if we ordered ahead of time! The only reason we went there was because they \"specialize\" in kotthu rotti.

We ended up ordering from Poorani Villas which was directly across from Kotthu Rotti Kadai. We got the same order within 20 minutes, although they provide a variety of food and not just kotthu rotti.

I don't see myself going there ever again!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!  Best kottu roti hands down.  The wait could be hours long,  so order ahead and give them a 20 minute buffer even then.  Well worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Exceptional food. Their mutton and chicken kotthus are awesome. You need to call ahead to order. If you like Kothu roti this definitely a must try place."}
{"text":"I used to love their kothu  and now not the same. Be consistent! Ordered spicy vege kothu it was not the same."}
