{"text":"Last time we went to True restaurant for the lunch, and I said that I would go back again. So, here we were.... The organic apple pear walnut salad was fresh and I love the yummy apples and pears with red wine vinaigrette. After the meal, I ordered the organic creme caramel. It was quite good, very creamy and smooth....  I like this place, and I love them to use organic ingredients to cooking. (It's hard to find a restaurant likes this in Toronto) So far, I've been there for 3-4 times and the service has been really good compared to many other places."}
{"text":"I went to True this weekend and it's a new fave of mine. For drinks I had their Organic Gin and Tonic...which I thought was going to be just a gimic but let me tell you, I have NEVER had a better GnT.  It's the tonic that's Organic and it's brought in from Brooklyn.   I had the beet salad (red AND yellow beets, hello!)  and the miso honey cod for dinner.  I ate the whole thing, and I am craving it even now. I loved the atmosphere, the decor and the waitress was very cute and nice.   I will be taking out of towners here from now on. Did I mention it was the BEST gin and tonic in my life???"}
{"text":"We decided to stop off at True while doing some shopping in Yorkville.  I'm from the Washington DC Metro area.  Yorkville is comparable to Georgetown, high-end shopping in an affluent part of town.  We selected True based on location, knowing nothing of the menu or reviews.  I really enjoyed the decor: white, clean and modern.  The restaurant serves organic food and appeals to ladies who lunch. My husband really liked his pasta with peppers and Italian sausage.  However, my True burger was super dry.  I asked for medium, but it was more like well done.    But the worse part was the service.  The server did the bare minimum, sat us, got us water, took our order and got us the check.  But there was not interest what-so-ever in refilling our glasses or checking if the food was alright or general warmth from the guy.  He was, however, very attentive with the other table next to us.  Basically, the food was average; not bad, but nothing special.  But the service, personally, was unsatisfactory and I would not recommend True based on my experiences."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch. It's a place that you would quite definitely pass bc it's kind of in a weird location on the second floor but once you actually step inside you encounter clean lines, white tables and sunny lighting. Very Sex and the City - sunday brunch. Except it was pretty dead - but that could have been due to the rain.  Had an omelette that came with fruit, salad and roasted potatoes. Fresh and yummy. Reading that this place is classified as Italian is news to me. Had a lovely waitress who was all smiles and whose name I wish I remembered.   Oh and it's \"organic\" except for the \"wild fish\". Whatever that really means."}
{"text":"I've been to True a handful of times for lunch. The concept I've found to be more appealing than the food (organic wine clashes with my palette). However, last week I had a particularly difficult time. Allow me to explain:  We arrived at the table for lunch and began to order drinks. My three other friends made their order but I guess because I was looking at the drink menu this meant I didn't want anything, nor did the server ask. Okay, I can understand, I wasn't paying attention. My fault. When the server comes back with the drinks I will make my order for a tasty beverage then. He arrives with the drinks in tow and I place my order (success), but at that point we are all ready to order our meal, which we do.  After a few minutes of waiting I still had no tasty beverage. I flag down our server to ask about my drink order (obviously forgotten when it was placed with the food order), which he immediately goes to retrieve. Okay, I can still understand. When placing a drink order with a meal in a group setting, remind him about the drink order before he leaves. My fault again. When he arrives with my tasty beverage in bottle form (beer if you couldn't guess), he pours it into a glass, however, he didn't tip the glass nor pour it slowly, so I am now left with an all-head glass of beer, waiting for it to be drinkable. Now I am upset. Not because of the near 15 minute wait to get a drink, but because when it arrives, I am forced to let it sit (another 5 minutes) because it is undrinkable. My friends were ready to order another drink while mine was sitting waiting.  I hate to be one of those people that complains about minutiae details such as pouring a beer, but that day I was. If I performed that level of service in my line of work, I would be easily replaceable.  Beyond the service, I tried the True Burger that day. It was one of the driest, least moist burgers I've ever had (ordered it medium rare). It's sad, because I've previously had pasta and pizza here which were good, but I guess it just wasn't my day. If I could give a rating of 1.5 stars I would because of previous meals, here, but I can't so it gets 1 star based off my last experience."}
{"text":"Sometimes you can walk into a restaurant and know immediately it will go out of business soon, even if you can't put your finger on why. And then you eat the food and have a good guess.  True tries to be an upscale health-conscious organic/local food restaurant. What a load of shit; it's greenwashing at its worst. Is the food organic/local? Maybe, but it was also bland, overcooked with tiny portions. True is average diner food with the portions cut in half and the eggs overcooked with higher prices. Go to Fran's across the street instead."}
{"text":"Went here for an early dinner this week, after having walked past it so many times since it opened. It was a really hot day, so the shaded patio was a big draw.  The whole design and concept is supposed to make you feel healthy. So I was surprised that my chicken salad had pieces of very fatty fried chicken. The rest of the salad was fine, but nothing special... My friend had the seafood salad and seemed to fare better. My mojito was refreshing and tasty, but probably not the healthiest thing either. So after throwing the whole \"this is going to be a healthy, nutritious meal\" idea out the window, I decided I might as well try their desserts, and was pleasantly surprised with their warm and fluffy bread pudding. Yum! My friend's tiramisu looked pretty good too.  Overall - classy ambiance, attentive and polite service, so-so food. As with many Yorkville spots, a touch overpriced for what you're getting. You do get a sense that they are trying a little too hard to be trendy... Yet every time I have passed by, it has been pretty empty."}
{"text":"I visited Toronto on a business trip and arrived pretty late, so I wanted a dinner that was satisfying but still healthy and light. Thank goodness I stumbled upon True around the corner of my hotel!   I was instantly attracted by the clean, white space and lighting, which gives the restaurant a modern-but-not-too-pretentious vibe. After much debate, I ordered the Mushroom Soup and the True Chicken Salad. My friend ordered their Margherita Pizza with whole wheat crust. We loved everything but my ultimate favorite was the mushroom soup - they didn't use cream so it wasn't too rich, and I loved the texture of the pureed mixed organic mushrooms with a hint of black truffle oil. The salad consisted of baby spinach, berries and sliced almonds, but the best part was the organic yogurt drizzled on top and the pieces of breaded chicken. The waitress informed me that most people have a love-hate relationship with the chicken as its breaded with wheat bread, but I loved it.  My friend's pizza was amazing - super thin crust and delicious flavor, with just the right proportions of mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce and basil! I definitely recommend True if you're in the mood for light fare."}
{"text":"This place was pretty bad. The food itself was average but the fact that all fruit and garnishes tasted like plastic or fridge was very off-putting. The taste was off, whatever it was. They were creative with their cocktail concoctions, but there was the same \"off\" flavour for everything--cocktails and food alike. If they stored things differently to not get that fridge, plastic or soap taste, whatever it was, it would be better. Taste alone I'd put it at a 2. They have a nice patio and friendly service, which is the only reason I'm giving this place a 3. This was in 2009 when I tried them out, maybe they've improved since then. Worth a try."}
{"text":"I've always been searching for an organic place to eat that is awesome and reasonably priced and found this place! Food and service is great and the atmosphere is really nice!"}
