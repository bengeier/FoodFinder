{"text":"Great place, great french food hosted by a young lovely people.  BYOW makes the cost of the meal more reasonable so you can splurge and try some of the excellent  and varied fairs on the table d'hote or a la carte.  

Make sure to make reservation, this place is always booked solid."}
{"text":"Nice simple place, good food - but not clear on why there is such a long waiting list to get a table. It's not that earth shattering..."}
{"text":"Pas de quoi se petter les bretelles, c'est bon mais j'ai connu mieux. Un filet mignon bleu, pas vraiment bleu...disons saignant. Pour un mercredi pas trop plein, pas trop présent les serveurs, si vous voulez du pain en extra, faut le demander. A voir les derniers commentaires, faut croire que les gens ne sortent pas beaucoup..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a true hidden gem on our little Island.  It is small and you are treated like family when you dine here. 

I was not sure if I should write this review, it is already booked ahead of time and reservations are strongly recommended - the more people know about it... The harder it will be for us \"locals\" to get in.

This is not a commercial franchise style restaurant, they basically have 2 \"seatings\" and this historical dining room (the old Viger house living room) sits about 30 people.  

It is a true pleasure and the quality value is outstanding.  if this restaurant were in Old Montreal, you would be paying double the price and it would already have some major write-ups!

BYOB as well - added bonus!!!

Well done!

{"text":"I would give 5 stars to this hidden gem.
Have gone several times and never disappointed.
The chef is from Alberta and really knows how to cook the meat dishes.
Personal and intimate atmosphere.

Have to reserve ahead....we reserved 2 months ahead for the Christmas get together."}
{"text":"Simply the best ... if you really want to eat absolutely the best meal in the world then make a reservation and go!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant we've been to and believe me We've been to many. The young couple come from N.B. and are absolutely fantastic, both as chef and guest receiving. The food is out of this world and their specialties ( on the chalkboard ) include soup or salad, choice of 3 main courses, dessert and coffee or tea all for about $40. It's a BYOB as well. Reservations are a must and once you go, you'll know why. This is a 5 star rating as we've been many times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"First thing I have to say is if I could have given it more than 5 stars I would have.  This restaurant is really small but extremely popular. This means that it is hard to get a reservation. We were on the waiting list and got the call the day before. 

Service was great. I was there with a group of friends, some are english speaking only and the waitresses had no problem in either french or english. 

We took the table d'hôte.  Some took the beef and I took the lobster. My first meal was a soup. Carrots, orange and ginger. It was extremely good. For the main  plate, the duck was really good and there was actually and lot of it. More than I expected. I had heard that the sauces were good but I did not know how good. It was a figues and balsamic sauce. My girlfriend had the beef, which I tasted and it was melting in my mouth.

For desserts I took the lemon cheesecake. The beginning was really soft and it was really good. The chocolate cake tasted a bit like a mi-cuit: it was soft and moist.

All in all, this place is a little gem in th le west island. Font be discouraged by the waiting time and just be sure to call well in advance. I month in advance if possible.

I was forgetting to mention. For the price it came ar about 50$ per personn and it's a bring your own bottle which helps control the price"}
{"text":"It really is as good as it gets! Food is excellent, service perfect, great selection of items, menu different all the time. Bring your own wine is a huge plus!

Only negative is that its so hard to get a reservation!"}
{"text":"This tiny oh so charming French Bistro is really worth the trip.  It's been a couple of months since I went there but I can still taste how tender and perfectly cooked my venison filet was (sublime).  The crab cake was melt in your mouth. It is a bit pricy - $60+ (tax and tip) for my meal which was one of the choices on the Table d'hôte and included soup and desert.  I was too stuffed to eat desert so they deducted a couple of bucks off the bill which I thought was nice.  Best part - it's bring your own wine!  Service was friendly the chef even chatted with us for a couple of minutes on the way out.  Can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"Très bon resto français!  Situé dans une belle maison (probablement centenaire), l'ambiance est chaleureuse et intime.  Les coupes de viandes et cuissons sont excellentes, servies avec des sauces très aromatiques, et se marient vraiment bien ensemble.  Tout est vraiment très bon, de la soupe au dessert!

N'oubliez pas votre vin! Le resto n'est pas très grand et bien connu dans le coin alors réservez tot!"}
{"text":"Reserved 2 seats at the end of February for the beginning of April, but the wait was worth it. Cute restaurant in an unlikely location; a cozy cottage style house with a comfortable ambiance. 

We started with a crab cake. This crab cake was melt-in-your-mouth awesome! The crab flavour really came through and was perfectly paired with whatever sauce surrounded it. 

I ordered the venison with sweet and sour plum reduction, my girlfriend the filet mignon with bearnaise sauce. According to previous reviews, the cook (Tarek) is a genius with meat. Well I can testify to that! Both the venison and filet mignon were cooked to perfection. I did not really taste the plum in the sauce but it was still a great companion for the venison. The bearnaise did not overpower the filet, and it had a cool creamy aftertaste that ended every bite. 

For dessert we were presented with 5 options. I ordered the orange cake with blueberry coolie, my girlfriend the coffee and vanilla bean crème brulée. The orange cake. I thought to myself \"how good can a simple orange cake get\", seriously. I am telling you it was the highlight of my night. I will go back just for this cake. It was so soft and crumbly - just so good. The crème brulée was also really good. A well done spin-off of the classic. 

Great cozy restaurant with friendly staff (the real kind of friendly. Not just the friendly you expect). If you order off the table d'hôte the prices are appropriate for what you order, although à la carte was great too. Just make sure you reserve ahead of time as seats fill up quickly."}
