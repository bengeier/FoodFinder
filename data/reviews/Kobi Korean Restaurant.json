{"text":"This is a Korean BBQ restaurant located in downtown near Yonge and Bloor, that also serves the famous \"cheese\" BBQ. I've been here a couple of times, and have tried their spicy chicken cheese BBQ and spicy squid cheese BBQ, both of which tasted delicious.

Due to the restaurant being close to UofT, you will generally find a lot of students in this restaurant. They also serve Korean drinks so I think it would be a good place to gather and hang around with your friends.

The service was also very good every time I came here, as they were prompt with my order and food. Best of all, since this is korean bbq, you get to cook it yourself and wait for it to finish before eating. 

I would come back here again and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Kobi is truly a gem tucked away on the busy yonge street in Toronto..the food is fresh and made fresh the service is friendly and it has free WiFi..I great way to spend lunch with friends or catch up on emails with a good meal"}
{"text":"I always get the chicken with the pucks and is ADDICTING! So yummy and I crave it a week later. I love the spices they use! The cheese is also a great touch to cut the spice. It also has pieces of pineapples and corn mixed in. I made the mistake of getting spicy once, it was too spicy!! I stick to mild now and LOVE IT. A great place for a group outing."}
{"text":"Went there with friends. A little loud for my taste but it worked out great because one of my friend has her toddler with her. Tried cheese fire chicken and plate naeng-myeon. Pretty decent. The only thing us that the chicken doesn't come with rice so we had to order separately. The chicken was quite salty but it was great with rice and Udon noodles which we added on the fire chicken grill. Try it if you haven't."}
{"text":"I live not too far away and years I finally had a chance to come. I left feeling it was just \"ok\". 

We had the chicken with cheese. I added extra udon. Taste wise I think the chili sauce they use is spot on! It has the right texture and ratio spicy/sweetness/saltiness for me. Totally hit the spot. The side dishes were of good quality. My only complaint is the portion and price. I feel the price is a bit on the high side. I know it's 2018 but I think you can get similar thing at Joons for a bit cheaper. The portion of cheese and udon were quite small in my opinion, especially the udon which was $5.

I wouldn't mind coming back. There are places with better value but the quality of the food makes this a \"maybe\". But in my area there are just too many choices for Korean food."}
{"text":"Pretty much what every other negative comment says - food is very overpriced for what it is. The service definitely needs some working compared to other Korean restaurants I have been to (I don't even need to mention the names.. any place in Korea town or China town would beat here). If you are looking for a casual meal when you starve on Yonge then sure come here but if you want a great experience, there are plenty of other places."}
{"text":"Contrary to previous reviewers, I've had a great experience at Kobi. Both times, we got 2 portions of the cheesy spicy squid/chicken to share between 2 people. 

The quantity of the food felt perfect for 2 as the food was on the fatter side. Our order also came with a steam egg which help cut the spice (we ordered hot) and some side dishes. 

The cheese melted nicely into very stringy cheese and the seasoning of the meat (sweet and spicy) paired perfectly!"}
{"text":"I usually try not to give 1 star reviews, but this this is probably the worst experience I had in a restaurant. Poor service, poor food quality, and a overpriced meal.

It was a bit after 11pm, we were looking for a place to eat and decided to go to here, since it was one of the few places that were still open, and the signboard says they close at 1am.

 We seated ourselves and placed our orders shortly afterwards. I ordered the chicken bimbimbap and my three other friends all ordered pork bone soup. The side dishes were out soon and was soon over because the amount was was so less and we were 4 people. We asked for refill and was told the kitchen was closed. Really?? It's not even 11:30pm (their closing time is 1am) and it's not like they have to cook they sidedishes - just have to bring it out . Their excuse was they packed everything up.

The food was soon out and the waiter left without bringing out the water. We had to ask him for water. 

The bimbimbap was quite average. Even though it looked good on the picture, the chicken was not well marinated and with mostly rice underneath. My friend says their their pork bone soup had very little meat in them as well.

Definitely not coming back here again."}
{"text":"tl;dr: Don't come here. 

I would give a zero if I could. The pictures in the menu are wildly misleading (see attached photos). The $18 pork belly was barely enough for a single person. We also ordered marinated beef ribs which was $24 and we got two thin slices of meat. 

They also served us pork belly slices instead of the beef belly slices we ordered. We thought the thin pork belly slices were part of the other pork belly order (which would be a reasonable portion). However, when we asked the server for our beef belly order, they insisted that they did serve us the beef belly.

The taste was also in no way able to justify the steep price tag. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Average food and prices. Was not very flavourful in comparison to a lot of other places in Scarborough or even just other Korean restaurants close by."}
{"text":"We had the bulgogi stew and the spicy pork rib stew. Both were fresh and really tasty! Service was quick and the banchan was so good!"}
{"text":"The food met expectations - nothing amazing, but it was delicious! The last time I was here, I had the cold noodle & bulgogi combo - quite tasty and worth the price (~$15.00 + tax). 

One thing I really liked was the service. The server who assisted us was very helpful and accommodating - my friend accidentally ordered a dish that was spicy and only realized once the dish came (the dish had a heaping amount of red sauce on top). The server offered to have the dish remade but my friend said it was okay because he was starving. The server even tried to take off some of the sauce for him before serving it - very nice of the server. The dish didn't end up being that spicy but the server would come and check on us and bring us refills of water - we were dying of laughter. We were all in all very pleased with how the server handled the incident and how accommodating she was - it definitely made our night."}
