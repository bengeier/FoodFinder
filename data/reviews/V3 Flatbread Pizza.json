{"text":"Very awesome and pleasant place to eat. Wonderful food& Lisa helped us with the menu and was very welcoming."}
{"text":"Rude staff and the food is pretty bad. There are so many better places in Lawrenceville"}
{"text":"A coworker and I came to V3 for lunch and it exceeded our expectations. We expected sub-par pizza, similar in quality to subway but we were surprised! Good crust, nice selection of sauces, toppings,etc and the best part was no additional charge for toppings. Its literally $8 for whatever you want. you could get every single topping they have and still pay $8. The only downside is that the line gets long VERY quickly as they cook the pizzas while you're in line and that tends to back things up. Go when they open at 11 and you'll be good to go!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The manager of the restaurant stopped me and my husband on the street and gave us a buy one get one free pizza. We thought what the heck let's give it a try. Boy we were impressed! Think Chipotle but for pizza. You walk in and a friendly staff greets you. They walk you through the process of picking out a dough, sauce and all the toppings. They bake it fresh and ten minutes later you have a delicious cheesy goodness flat bread pizza on your table. Even without the coupon my husband and I would come back because of the happy friendly cheery staff and the fresh delicious pizza! Great job V3 and I like your cool manager too, glad she stopped us!"}
{"text":"Huge selection of toppings, very fresh ingredients including lots of veggies. Unlimited toppings for a flat price ($8.56) makes this a really great value. The crust was thin and crispy, but so thin that it was basically black on either end, so docked one star for that. Service was very attentive and eager to please."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the neighborhood. Fast pizza, very reasonably priced and excellent ingredients. You can get unlimited topping for 8 bucks...pretty hard to beat. An awesome option for a quick cheap bite in Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"I've recently gone gluten free and I was glad to see that this place had gluten--free crust available. I tried it and didn't notice any difference in taste or feeling, which was nice. However, the customer in front of me in line got a regular crust and traditional red sauce. I saw them use the sauce ladle to spread the sauce on her crust and put it back into the sauce, then use the same ladle to spread the sauce on my gluten-free crust. This raises some cross-contamination issues - not a problem for me, but definitely dangerous for people with more serious health-related gluten-free diets.

But I do really like this place! They have so many options for sauce, cheese, and toppings! Pizzas are a flat rate, which allows you to put as many toppings as you want without worrying about crazy upcharges. They are a good size, I have ended up taking about 1/3 of my pizza home because it was too much, but I've also eaten the whole thing myself. My boyfriend and I have very different tastes, so we like that we can each get our own pizzas and make them exactly how we want them.

There is upstairs seating available, which I like because it is away from the counter. However, the lights were turned low - seemingly for an \"atmosphere\" reason. Maybe it's just me, but I like to be able to see my food when I eat, and it feels a little dark up there. 

Excited to see that they now have a Lawrenceville location too, much easier than driving downtown for me!"}
{"text":"Don't bother going within an half hour of closing. They will already be closed and just say \"I don't know...\" when you knock on the door. Posting this review the same day I tried to go there at 8:40 on a sunday..."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch last week.  I saw the demo of the old Vocelli's that was here. The V3 sign went up not too long after.  This is a new 'line' of stores that Vocelli's is testing out, from what I hear on the local pizza blog.  V3 is essentially a pizza form of Chipotle, but better.    You start on one end of the counter and choose your crust.  Traditional, Multigrain, Gluten-Free ($1 more).  The fresh doughball is then put through a machine to be pressed out into a rectangle and pressed onto the pan.  Then you choose your sauce and all your toppings.  You can choose one that they have already put together as well. It goes into the conveyor oven.  While it cooks, you pay for it.  It comes out on the other side and goes to the finishing station where you can add some olive oils, fresh basil, more cheese, etc.  Box it up and take it to-go, or eat inside the 2 level spacious area.  For $8 per pizza, you can't beat it.  You can get several toppings too; I'm talking 5-6 toppings and its still $8.  You best be gettin' to this place before there is a line out the door!  New favorite lunch calorie splurge.  Because this is a \"make your own\" place, there is no website or ordering over the phone."}
{"text":"Out of gluten free regularly, it even at 4:00pm they won't take out more gluten free dough."}
{"text":"Great tasting. Relatively cheap. Large quantity. Good atmosphere. Kind employees. The General Manager was exceedingly patient and kind with me when I was ignorant of the ordering process the first time I went. One of my new favorite pizza places in the Burgh."}
{"text":"I really liked being able to build a pizza of my choice. A little confusing because I would pick a topping but had to pick another first because it matters in what order they put things on. I would go back and build some more."}
{"text":"Best thin crust pizza I had. Extremely fresh ingredients. This is a very clean place. I really enjoyed it.
This is a gem in downtown Pittsburgh. You should try it out."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizzas are hard to find in this city. I ordered over the phone and the pizza was ready in ten minutes. It was fast, cheap, and easy. I'm grateful there's a place that sells gluten free pizza in Lawrenceville!"}
{"text":"They say the closing time is 9 pm and the door is locked at 8:45. I even tried knocking and the lady inside didn't pay any attention and was busy cleaning. Not the type of service you expect for a good quality pizza chain"}
{"text":"Came for take out, even after reading the reviews. I never bypass a chance for gluten free pizza. We found all of the things coming up as negative resolved. My daughter and I each had our own \"pizza maker\", and both of them were friendly and proficient. And changed their gloves frequently. Pizza was very good (We both went with a design your own) And the gluten free was even good cold the next day, a real rarity. I definitely felt they took the service critique to heart, and I'd happily return."}
{"text":"Very busy place at lunch time for the office folks. Get there before noon or you will definitely have a long line. 
This was my first time here all of the choice combinations were a bit overwhelming with underwhelming flavor. I ordered the vegetarian pizza (cannot remember the name). There was not much flavor because they barely put any veggies on the pizza. I'm used to large chunks or artichokes, but here they separate each individual slice and place it on the pizza. 
Too many other good restaurants in town for me to hurry back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"The pizza is very tasty. I like the variety of topping. The pies are smaller than I thought tho. I could eat two of them myself."}
{"text":"Great topping choices, and they let you really load them up! Service could be a little friendlier, but it may have been an off day."}
{"text":"Easy concept: its the Chipotle of flatbread pizzas. You pick your crust, sauce and toppings: whatever you want for one low price of $8. They also have pre-determined selections if you're not feeling creative or you're overwhelmed by the number of toppings they have. 

Came here for a late lunch and there was only one person ahead of me. I opted for a make-your-own and got multi-grain crust, traditional red sauce, and some usual toppings that I won't go on to list. It appeared to me that you could get as many toppings as you'd like because no where does the menu mention any limitations. However, when you ask for a topping, they don't really put on that much. So I recommend that you get a lot of toppings to get your money's worth unless there is hidden fine print on limitations somewhere that I didn't see. After you order your toppings, they put it in one of those pizza conveyor belt ovens and in a few minutes, it's nice and toasted for you. It comes out in a long rectangle with 8 slices. But wait, there's more! You get the option of topping it with their \"Finishes\" which are herb and spice-infused oils, extra cheeses or sauces. These oils and sauces are also placed on a counter by the door so if you'd rather put it on yourself, you have that option too. 

Taste-wise, it was really good! The crust was thin and crunchy. The traditional red sauce was a little sweet, which I liked. My toppings were fresh, but like I mentioned earlier, not very generous. It did remind me of the taste of Vocelli's but with a much thinner crust. The pizza is probably best for one person and not shared since its more the size of a personal pizza. 

Food was tasty and service was quick. I definitely see myself coming here for lunch when I'm in the mood for something fast and easy."}
{"text":"Crisp crust, flavorful sauce, generous toppings! This is the \"chop shop\" with the addition of banana peppers. $8.00
The choice of toppings is large, and then after, there are other ingredients you can add to your cooked flatbread: arugula, fresh spinach, more cheese, balsamic vinegar and flavored olive oils, etc.

The one ingredient they definitely need to take this to 5 stars for me is grilled eggplant!

I will definitely be going back and creating all kinds of combinations!"}
{"text":"First of all, the food is fantastic! The pizza is perfectly done every time and there are so many toppings to choose from. I've been here three times now so I think it's safe to write a review as my experience has been similar each time.

The first people you encounter are great!  Every visit the initial order taker has been friendly and energetic. My first visit, she nicely explained how it works and all the various options. You pick your crust, sauce, and toppings then you go to the cashier to pay. This is where it starts to go downhill.  

Each visit, the cashier has been distracted, once she was actually on her phone. Every visit, the cashier has not been friendly, just asking if I wanted to add a brownie and drink and then giving me my total.  No greeting, no thank you, no have a nice day.  Just here's your change. 

The next step is to wait for your pizza to cook and then add any finishing touches you want. The first visit, the person working this area was not clear about which pizza he was working on and I almost got someone else's.  The second and third visits he was even more unfocused than the cashier. One visit I had to tell him three times that I wanted asiago cheese before he zoned in and started to move.  It's not like I had a list of things he was having trouble remembering.  It was just that one thing. 

Food A++. Staff 1/3 fantastic, 2/3 apathetic. Perk up your cashiers and get a new closer and this could be a five star place."}
{"text":"Desperation ordered on Grubhub when I got home super late from work - was an excellent choice! In expensive, tasty, fresh - quick service (I picked up my order). Will order again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pie in the city... even though it's flatbread.  The gluten free crust is amazing, the best I've found. I always do the create your own, and add on unlimited fresh veggies.  The spicy red sauce is my personal fave.  Service is quick. The cost cannot be matched for fast food to quality ratio. Thank you!! 4 stars only bc of the looks of the salads and seating ambience could be better! Get a flatbread not a salad here.

{"text":"Just to let everyone know I had this idea quite a while ago to have a pizza place with unlimited toppings for one good price.  I did not copyright that idea unfortunately.  Blaze pizza does that same thing, but the one that I went to had all this ash on the bottom of it from the oven.  The pizza here is pretty much pristine and there are tons of toppings to choose from, or you can use one of their many house specials.  Not only that, but you have additional uncooked toppings that you may add to the pizza after it is a finished product.  There is lots of tablespace to chill out on and a nice veiw of the street from the dinning area.  There are also tons of beverage options including bottles coffees, sodas, sparkling waters and fountain drinks.  Yah, this place is pretty much an awesome choice at anytime.  I like this place because in order to get a good deal at most pizza places you have to order for a group of people and have everyone chip in.  With this place you can get pizza alone, or with a group and it is still a pretty good deal.  All the toppings are worth it as well and really being able to customize it is a thing of beauty.  The service was also excellent, yeee haw!"}
{"text":"So happy we found this place. We were visiting and desperately searching for gluten free restaurants. We were so happy to find that they had gluten free pizza. They were very careful to not cross contaminate the regular pizza with the gluten free."}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy, customized personal pizzas for a great price: $8 flat for unlimited toppings! They have a nice variety of toppings so there's something for everyone. You can build you own from scratch or get one off the menu. I got the margherita pizza with multigrain dough, with mozzarella, tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, asiago, and basil. For pizzas with an oil base like mine, I recommend not finishing with another oil on top because they're pretty generous with the oil base. Service was friendly and efficient as well."}
{"text":"Fireb pizza with a tremendous amount of toppings to go around... my favorite is the gluten free not because I'm allergic but it's a little thicker than the other options with a delicious chew to it when u bite down.. staff are great and they don't burn pizzas like the downtown location.. highly recommended"}
{"text":"This place is like Chipotle for flatbreads, where you customize everything from the crust, to sauce, toppings, and \"finishers\" (seasonings and olive oil). They have Gluten Free crust available for a dollar more, but that is the only upcharge on the menu. The flatbread that I created was delicious and would have easily been a $15 menu item at other restaurants. Not only is it cheap (relatively), it's really good and fairly quick. I went in at a weird time between lunch and dinner, so I was in and out, but I imagine the wait time could be a bit longer during peak lunch or dinner hours. They also have $8 pre-created options that seem pretty good too, if you're not feeling the \"choose your own adventure\" style. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Quick flatbread pizza for 8 bucks and unlimited topping. My sister and I shared one which was enough to hold both of us over for the night."}
{"text":"Hours said open until 9. I walked in at 730 and the woman working stopped helping the customers in front of her and yelled at me from behind the counter that she was NOT going to serve me because they were closed. At that point, I said that's fine and walked out because I was at a loss of how to react. 

The rudeness and lack of professionalism by the employee was very unfortunate because I had stopped in before and their product is pretty good. 

I'm thankful that I was turned away because I would not want to be served by someone with that kind of attitude anyway."}
{"text":"OMG, I am in love.  I love thin crust pizzas and this place - with the Subway assembly line style - does a fantastic job with an extremely tasty pie.  Three crust choices (including gluten free), 5 sauces (I loved the pesto) and a ton of fun and organic toppings.  They toast it up and once it's done, you can put more toppings on - cold cheeses, arugula, etc - and finishing oils and spices.  My pie - traditional crust, pesto sauce, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, fresh mozzarella, feta, roasted garlic, onion, and mushrooms was finished with balsamic and arugula - was everything I was looking for and more!  All for 8 bucks, too!  You don't have any limit for the toppings, but if you don't want to think - they have pre-designed pies as well which sound awesome.  Plus, two salads, a liege waffle with nutella for dessert and a case full of awesome bottled drinks."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by V3 Pizza. They are a build your own pizza company aimed at the lunch crowd and people on the go. You get to choose from 3 types of crusts, white, wheat, or gluten free, you get to choose from 1 of about 10 sauces, then top it however you see fit with any number of their fresh toppings. They pop it in the oven, then about 3-5 minutes later you are out the door with your freshly made personal pizza. All in all you are in and out in about 10 minutes. 

The thing that I appreciate is that they not only offer a gluten free option, but it's good. My girlfriend is GF, and she ranks this as the best gluten free pizza she's had. We can get 2 pizzas, loaded with toppings, one GF and one regular, for about $18 which. Gluten Free pizzas are usually very pricey, and I'm not a huge fan of them, so V3 offers an options that we can both enjoy."}
{"text":"One of the best $8 lunches in the city.  Great value, great quality, and great service.  I have been here a few times now and have yet to have a bad experience.  The price is $8 +tax regardless of what you get on either a whole wheat or regular flatbread.  I do believe there is an up charge for gluten free.  The ingredients are fresh and there is a wide variety of sauces, cheeses, and toppings allowing you to fully customize your order to what you prefer."}
{"text":"My first visit to V3 and it was excellent!  Crowded at lunchtime but the line moved quickly. Wide variety of toppings, spices, and tastes to choose from. If you like thin (I mean very thin) crust pizza, this is your place. Pizza and a drink for $10. I liked it!"}
{"text":"So good! Lots of great options. Buffalo chicken pizza was really good and everything tastes fresh."}
{"text":"Horrible. I thought we were getting some good pizza in the hood, but instead got horrible pizza, miserable, miserable staff amd subpar ingredients. You are going to make pizza in a dominos style oven? come on. No ingredients listed? a sauce that tastes like paste? And nasty employees? nope. Don't bother; Too many other places to try. I don't know who owns rhis place, but they need a do-over."}
{"text":"Went in and didn't know what to expect to be honest. I had only heard about V3. I work in Lawrenceville so the people I work with all spoke highly of it, it's really convenient because it's on the same street as my job. I left work hungry and didn't want to go home and cook, I saw the sign and said why not right? Never know if you don't try! Went in and the atmosphere was dope. Clean, friendly environment, the staff workers were exceptionally happy when I told them it was my first time being there! I got the BBQ pit boss and man was I impressed! The flat bread pizza was delicious. I love that they offer so many different ingredients for the pizzas they offer, or you can get one of their signatures as I did. Really affordable as well, AND they make the pizza in front of you! I recommend this pizza shop to anyone in search of Pizza in the Lawrenceville area."}
{"text":"Great employees, delicious pizza.  It's almost like SUBWAY, but in a pizza way.  They offer gluten free dough.  Even though it's a new location, it's worth the wait.  I had the spicy red sauce with my choices of toppings (pepperoni, sausage, prosciutto, spinacj, pineapple and a drizzle of evil), I almost cried that it was that good...it doesn't have that pizzeria atmosphere, but I do hope that it stays around and grows.  I will definitely travel back out to Lawrenceville, PA to get more of that pizza.  I tip my hat to the business.

I've had pizza from multiple states and cities, by far, The Best EVER!  even better than NYC pizza."}
{"text":"As someone who works downtown, we all know the issues of wanting to eat lunch or dinner at work.  Finding somewhere reasonably priced and quick can be a challenge. Market Square has helped with this, but when V3 popped up as an ROTD, I decided to test it out.

Taking the Qdoba approach, V3 allows you to get any pizza for $8.  The pizza is long, thin crust, and has about 8 small slices.  There were 8 sauces, a ton of toppings, and many \"finishers\" to choose from.  The interior is a warm modern vibe but may be trying a bit too hard to be trendy.

I ordered a tomato and green pepper pizza for my lunch. The toppings, unfortunately, were pretty low quality. The tomatoes were still green and the green peppers not too fresh.

The employees were very friendly except for a short girl with dark hair who was sulking around and screwing her coworkers over by not working.  Otherwise, this place was a fine place for lunch."}
{"text":"This delicious, wallet friendly, and highly customizable pizza/flatbread location will satisfy everyday eaters and gluten-free folks alike. Following Chipotle's assembly line business model, V3 provides a wholesome Za experience that minimizes the time it takes to get Pizza into your face-hole. NOTE: for Celiac's/Gluten-intolerant folks, cross contamination IS possible at this establishment so be cautious.

ZA REVIEW: To start, customers select their crust. I went with the gluten-free option (+$2) to accommodate my current dietary needs. Next, the sauce, of which they have many options. I went with their standard red. If you have spinach, it is applied before the cheese. Cheeses are diverse, I had both Wisconsin and fresh mutz. An even, unobtrusive amount of cheese is distributed, but customers can ask for more or less to taste. The plethora of toppings to be added before entering the oven were numerous, and customers can chose as many as they wantswithout any up charge. I tip my hat to that, V3. I went with spinach, green peppers, kalamata olives, sun-dried tomato, and grilled chicken. When removed from the oven, V3 offers \"finishers\" to be added to your flatbread/pizza. I added red pepper oil and fresh basil. Magnifico. My pizza was gorgeous. Perfect leopard spotting on the cheese, but an under-defined coastline (sauce separating cheese from crust). I could have done with a larger corniccione (crust), as I got sauce all over my hands and had to kill about 87 trees with all the napkins I used. The sauce was sweet, and complimented the tanginess of the sun-dried and kalamata olives tomatoes handsomely. The pizza was delicious. Even with added oil, no soggification of the crust occurred. SCC (sauce-cheese-crust) ratio was satisfactory, and this pizza was filling without being too heavy. I give V3 Flatbread/Pizza Za 7.5/10 pepperonis.

SERVICE REVIEW: People working the assembly line were kind, and did their jobs well. I noted that the pineapples were not fresh, and they were out of arugula as a finisher, which was a slight but not deal breaking turnoff. While the restaurant provides gluten-free options, as mentioned before, cross contamination can occur, so those with higher sensitivities may not want to eat here. This is disappointing. Additionally, the bathrooms required a code to be used, and we already threw out our receipt, so we had to find a toilet elsewhere.

BOTTOM LINE: V3 is an affordable, quick, and tasty pizza/flatbread option in Downtown Pittsburgh. Gluten-free options are available, but cross-contamination may deter those with harsher sensitivities. V3 gives customers the option to make a \"lighter\" flatbread, or a \"heavier\" pizza. The options for customization in this experience feel virtually limitless. V3 gets four stars for its well done Za and high customization but clear areas for improvement."}
{"text":"The fact that you can create your own pizza is cool but the dough and the ingredients themselves weren't great. The employees were slow and unfriendly. I also witnessed an employee being very rude to other employees."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. One of my new favorite lunch spots downtown. If you want to indulge and have some pizza, go here! You'll get a high-quality individual, made-to-order pizza that will not disappoint. I've been here a handful of times and the service has always been just as good as the food!

It can get a little crowded around lunch time, but they do a great job of keeping the line moving as quickly as it possibly could when you are having something made to order. Luckily there are additional tables upstairs because the 1st floor gets a little crazy around peak times. You pick your dough, your sauce, your toppings, and your cheese and they have a great variety of options. They also have a menu you can choose from if they options are overwhelming to you. I'm confident that this place could satisfy the pickiest eater up through the most adventurous eater! You can go as wild or as tame as you want.

This is a great option for people with specialized diets too, with no-cheese Vegan  pizzas and Gluten-free dough as well!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is served fresh, thin-crested, and stuffed with whatever you like.  If you don't like choosing, they also have a list of popular combos for you.  I love that the toppings, sauces, and oil aren't your traditional cherry-pickings.  I got an order of pesto pizza with olive, prosciutto, garlic, spinach, bell pepper, and mozzarella cheese.  The staff creates the most beautiful spread and in the oven the pizza goes!  I don't get excited about pizza easily, but V3 gave me plenty of reason to return.

On my next pizza:  definitely adding an egg!"}
{"text":"WARNING,  when I went for lunch today the person behind the counter pieced together a GF crust that was in about 6 pieces and tried to serveit to me. When I asked about the damaged crust, the person behind the counter stated that it was no big deal, to which I replied \"food quality and safety are a big deal.\" 

Not sure what training employees are put through but I have serious reservations about thier food safety procedures. I have never posted something like this in a review but this level of disregard for what they serve to the public is concerning."}
{"text":"Delicious and interesting flatbread options!  My husband and I shared 2 different flatbreads - one was steak-ranch and one was chicken BLT.  Both were very tasty with a light thin crust.  Definitely a must-try place to eat!  We even sat at tables and chairs right outside of the restaurant on the sidewalk with our two dogs.  Only downside is parking in downtown Pittsburgh.  I hope that V3 opens a location in the suburbs of Pittsburgh where parking is free and plentiful."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the custom personal pizza concept and this place seems a good version of that. I can't speak for others but the staff was nothing but polite to me. Pizza was tasty and the price was right. Roasted garlic is a potent but excellent addition post cook."}
{"text":"My co-workers checked this out when we were looking to add another restaurant to our lunch rotation, and it was a big hit.  I opted for a pre-selected set of toppings, while others did create-your-own, and nobody had any complaints.  I loved the chewy thin crust and the entire concept is good with me.  Just note that although the line gets really long really quickly, it also goes fairly fast because it's a Subway-like assembly process.  I'm only taking down a star because I would have liked more of the fresh ingredient topping that was the finisher on mine (basil), but I also see that it makes good business sense to keep the amount of toppings on the light side, especially since they are not yet charging a la carte for those, and they need to be able to assemble, cook, and deliver very quickly.  All in all, I thought it was a tasty good value and should have no trouble convincing anyone to go back."}
{"text":"this is a great pizza place! $8 for a flatbread with any toppings! out in two minutes cooked perfectly. highly recommend"}
{"text":"If you've ever been to a custom personal pizza place, you know what you're getting! 

Everything is fresh and the service is fast. I didn't have an issue with the service, and both men who attended to us were kind. 

The pizza was good, but not amazing. I like that you can really load it up with a lot of toppings because I feel like I'm eating a more balanced meal. Another plus is that they have fresh mozzarella and prosciutto, which many unlimited topping places don't!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out for lunch a couple of weeks ago and was pleased.  While many others compare it to Chipotle, which I get because they incorporate an assembly line to customize your personal pizza, the speed of Chipotle is missing.  But I'm not complaining...I think making a pizza takes longer than putting together a burrito!

You can choose between the crusts, sauce, toppings and finishers you'd like.  I went with the whole grain crust and did a variety of toppings based on other reviewers mentiong they are a little skimpy on their portion sizes of toppings (so ask for more or many!).  

I really enjoyed the thin crust and overall the pizza hit the spot since it was custom made by and for me.  My friend and I went early to just miss the lunch rush but there was a long line that followed closer to noon."}
{"text":"Great options and fantastic Pizza.  It works like Subway or Chipolte where you through, pick your dough, sauce, toppings, and finishes.   The cool thing is you can load up on their great toppings and not have an extra charge associated.  Get there early though, the line builds up pretty fast."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and I love that you can pick as many toppings as you'd like. The staff made some great suggestions too!"}
{"text":"Just picked up takeout from V3. I ordered the Barbeque and my wife had pepperoni with cheese. This was the best flat bread pizza we've had in Lawrenceville over the last two months! 

The crust was perfect and the toppings were tasty! This is a chain that offers several types of dough, including gluten free. We had the regular flatbread crust. All pizzas are $8. Gluten free is a couple dollars more. 

After reading some of the poor reviews we were hesitant to try it out but we were pleasantly surprised. 

The store was empty at 8pm and I think the two people working were owners or managers. The area behind the counter was a bit messy and there were only about 4 different bottled drinks to select from the cooler. They did have a decent selection of soda fountain drinks. 

We will definitely go back. It's hard to beat excellent quality at less than $20 for two people. FYI - We didn't order drinks because it was takeout.  

Expect an update to the review if there is an issue with consistency as noted by other posts."}
{"text":"My first visit today. We ordered a number of gluten free pizzas. They tasted great and the price was right.  We ever the only ones there. Service was average. I hope this place survives because the food is great."}
{"text":"There's something about being the master of my own food destiny that is appealing to me. Build-your-own burrito places, sandwich shops, froyo shops....I love them all. And now there is a build-your-own pizza place! V3 operates exactly like Chipotle or Subway....you choose your own crust, sauce, and toppings, they run it through the oven, and voila....customized pizza! After it's cooked, you can even doctor it up with \"finishers\" (cheeses, oils, etc.) to add the final piece de resistance to your creation. The pizza crusts they use are flatbread crusts, so it's very thin and crispy. It's quite large (8 slices), but because it's so thin, one person with a normal appetite should be able to finish a pizza themselves. 

The pizzas are a flat $8 price, regardless of how many toppings you choose. They also have pre-made selections that you can order if you don't feel like making your own. During my visit, I opted to make my own with a multigrain crust, pesto sauce, mozzarella cheese, spinach, roasted garlic, and chicken. For the price, I thought the pizza was quite tasty, although they were fairly stingy with the toppings. Unlike Chipotle, where they will heap the meat and beans onto your burrito with reckless abandon, here they carefully measure every topping so you get a set amount. I'm sure they do this as a cost-savings measure....and it probably doesn't make a difference in the pizza taste if you get a ton of toppings, but if you only get a few like I did, it can make the pizza seem a little sparse and sad. I guess next time I'll go toppings wild!

I came here during dinner time, and the process moved quickly because there were only a few other people there. I wonder how fast the line moves during lunchtime rushes though? Regardless, it's a cool concept and I'm sure I'll be back to Frankenstein up another pizza soon!"}
{"text":"I really want to like V3 for the food, but the service is slow and not efficient. While waiting for food to cook, one server begin eating her own food from the fridge, leaving her food container open on the counter top in between taking orders. 

In addition, servers were short tempered and the loud music and sounds of them throwing boxes while cleaning made it impossible to order without yelling."}
{"text":"Garbage. The service was terrible and I had better pizza out of a freezer, so dissapointed. Not to mention there were fly's landing on the OPEN ingredients. Dont waste your money, patience or time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the concept of this place. Basically our first build your own pizza place and almost no wait as I would have expected. 

When you walk into V3 you have the option to pick one of their creations or build your own pizza. If you choose build your own you pick the following for your pizza: dough, sauce, toppings, and meats and the pizza goes through a small oven for about 3 minutes. Once it's finished you are asked if you would like to top it with anything such as cheese, pepper flakes, flavored olive oils, etc. And best part is, all pizzas are only $8!

As for the pizza themselves, I really enjoy them. I like a thinner crust because when pizza crust gets too think you feel like you are only filling up on dough. So far I have tried their Tuscan garden and firehouse chicken (buffalo chicken) pizzas and I love both. I personally love them too much to create my own but I have had friends create their own and they love it. 

If you work downtown and you haven't been here yet you need to give it a try ASAP!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The woman explained it all to me pretty well, so I wasn't lost in the sauce going through the order line. 
The pizza came out quickly and was surprisingly delicious. It wasn't burnt, and wasn't undercooked. Seriously cooked to perfection.They need to do better on the fountain drink choices though."}
{"text":"Service has been wonderful the multiple times I've been since they opened. Have tried their already designed pizza and have made my own. Fun concept and delicious pizza. In and out in about 10 minutes with pizza in hand. Will continue to visit at lunch!!!"}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 out of 5 kind of experience.  Customization is all this place is about.  It gives gluten free dough as an option along with multi grain and traditional.  We ordered the buttermilk chicken and Tuscan garden.  Of the two the buttermilk was more flavorful which surprised me because there was more toppings on the Tuscan yet it felt a little muddled and lacking that punch.  Maybe some red chili flakes ..."}
{"text":"This place was everything you'd expect, which is a good thing. Clean interior, a pizza with unlimited toppings for $8, and a decent staff. Is it the best pizza I've ever had? No, but it was $8. Is it the best food in Lawrenceville? No, but they're one of the only places open on a Sunday evening or Monday."}
{"text":"A healthy alternative to pizza... A variety of choices for toppings that include V3's house combinations. 

The atmosphere is spacious and amazing...lots of seating for groups, that include ample space for working. It is also good for dining alone or a date night. 

It was my first visit; but certainly will not be my last....as there are so many possibilities to try.  Today, I ordered the Buttermilk Chicken it was a combination of deliciousness! I enjoyed and savored every bite. 

You will not regret the dining experience at this place, try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"The food is very good, you have to go early though to beat the line. You can tell there are still some kinks to be worked out in the kitchen but overall really good!"}
{"text":"Not offensive but not great. Basically pizza meets subway in terms of food. If you're in a hurry, be sure to show up early. Lines do move fast."}
{"text":"Great spot for a lunchtime break downtown! Fun ingredient choices to make your own custom flatbread pizza. I like that they offered a multigrain crust option, plenty of flavorful cheeses and veggie toppings. The flatbread is a really generous size but isn't too heavy for lunch. 
There was a bit of a long line when I visited but it moved quickly."}
{"text":"I had a phenomenal pizza today for lunch. I was in and out quickly and The service was great! I will say though that I really hope you out additional signage outside to entice people in! I work across the street and just noticed you guys today. When I asked the people that work there they said you've been open since November. I actually had to put my face up to the glass to see if there was anything going on inside and when I looked in I was surprised to see a line of people ordering pizzas! You need to make that window wall lighter so people can see in or some type of sign that indicates you are a pizza shop. The V3 branding looks nothing like what you are...a food establishment. I thought V3 was a wine shop or spa or something. Maybe revisit some of your branding. Also, put your hashtag on the menu or on a sign somewhere so people can continue to talk about it! I couldn't find it! Please work on the marketing efforts so you don't have to close! It's delicious and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! You can create your own or select one of the menu items, either way you can't go wrong. It's light, not greasy, but takes as if it's a brick oven style pizza.....yum!"}
{"text":"$8 flat rate for any pizza. It's definitely a good deal. They have some signature pizzas that you can choose from or you can choose to build your own. The concept is very similar to the many fast casual restaurants that are popping up (Chipotle, Qdoba, Subway, etc.) 

If you choose to build your own, you get unlimited toppings for the flat rate of $8. They have numerous sauce options that you can pick from for the base of your pizza, so it makes it easy to be adventurous with your creation. The meats, cheeses, and veggies are plentiful in choices as well. They do not have a shortage of toppings to choose from! They have something for everyone here! 

I have eaten here a few times and I have not been disappointed with the quality of food or service. I have had a chance to have a conversation with Tony, the owner, and he is genuinely a good guy who cares about all of his customers. 

It's a good place to pick up a quick meal, and I plan on returning for future visits."}
{"text":"Another V3 Flatbread opened.  The ideas is a fast casual pizza shop were you create your own pizza in a cafeteria line like Subway, Chipotle or some of the new pizza shops opening up.  You get as many toppings as you want for $8.  My pizza crust was overcooked, to hard and very crunchy and had no real taste.  Some of the topping were a little burnt, not the way I prefer.  The do have a couple of salad choices to. This location has limited seating at some high tables.  V3 is owned by the owner of Vocelli's Pizza."}
{"text":"V3 is like a few other pizza shops that are around that you order and have it built and cooked as you are in line - City Oven, Stone and many in other cities.  
Owned by Vocelli's.
You can order from 3 crusts and 5 sauces, lots of toppings and after it is cooked they put an oil at the end if you would like.  You can pick what you want and there are about 8 pizzas on the menu.  I ordered the Sunny Side Sausage and had sun fried tomato added.  All for $8.  Not bad.  The pizza was good but the dough was a little dry and not any flavor.  There are two salads on the menu. 
The place is small with a few tables but the line was beside the few tables, more of a take out place.  
I would think that this will be popular for lunch in a busy downtown."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. 5 stars for exceeding my expectations. I went earlier in the week for dinner and it was kind of dead with only 2 other customers. I'm horrible when given too many choices so I got the Chop Shop with added olives and jalapeños on a regular flatbread. The pizza was very flavorful and very filling for a flatbread. Will go again not only out of convenience (2 min walk) but because I love pizza and this is better, and less caloric, than most of the chains in pgh."}
{"text":"8 bucks for a flatbread pizza with unlimited toppings, great deal especially for a quick but delicious lunch"}
{"text":"Some coworkers really like this place but I hadn't been there yet. Eager to try it, another coworker and I tried to get it on Sunday. We couldn't find a menu or phone number online so we walked over. Closed. Despite the hours on the website saying they were open. Would have been helpful if we could have called to check. 

The next day, still craving pizza I walked over myself and decided to try again. It was open! Despite a rocky start, I loved it! It was like a subway for pizza and done in minutes! I love all the organic portions, plus gluten free dough available! I'll have to take my family who is gluten free there to try it out. I had the traditional dough with red sauce, fresh mozzarella, pecorino Romano, reissued garlic, organic mushrooms and Italian sausage. Then to finish after it was cooked I had them add a drizzle of olive oil, shaved Parmesan and fresh organic arugula. 

It was incredible! I loved the size for the price and how quick it took to make. I will definitively go back! I also really like that it is a locally owned business. And the decor was really chic! It's a nice addition to the downtown restaurant scene and very convenient (when open) for downtown workers."}
{"text":"Yum! A friend suggested we go to V3 before the Alton Brown event and was so happy she did - I am digging these Chipotle-esque pizza joints recently. V3 is located on what I think is a quieter street in Downtown. As other reviewers have said, the toppings are sparse however the finished pizza is well constructed and this can be counterbalanced by asking for more toppings. And you can have more than one sauce on your pizza - I asked for two cause I couldn't decide! The price is reasonable and the outcome is delicious - I will be back."}
{"text":"When traveling to Pittsburgh last week, I needed to find a gluten free place to get a quick bite for lunch. I didn't have a car and i was staying at the Renaissance hotel. I pulled up Yelp and found this place very close by so I decided to give it a try. I am giving them 5 stars because the staff was super friendly and the pizza was extra tasty. The big bonus for me is they took extra precautions to ensure that there was no cross contamination of gluten. Most low cost establishments don't really get it and I have trouble with cross contamination. Most places will give you a gluten free crust but they usually don't understand the rest of the challenges even when you say it is an allergy. Not this place. They switched their gloves, used different baking dishes, different cutters, they took every precaution. It was very refreshing and I was able to eat a tasty gluten free meal without getting sick.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"While I appreciate the new spin on made-to-order pizzas I do not appreciate unfriendly, ill-tempered, and unpleasant customer service from employees of this business. By no means am I saying that all V3 employees have displayed such disrespectful service towards patrons; however, it's takes one person to ruin it for all the others. During a recent visit I was shocked when an employee muttered something under her breath in response to a customer's request. It was said with such an attitude that it was rather off-putting. Needless to say, it spoiled my visit to V3 and made my pizza less enjoyable. 

I would rather draw attention to this occurrence as opposed to idly sitting by and letting that kind of service continue. So, I suggest that management train their employees on how be personable and respectful to customers. After all, the V3 experience is heavily dependent on customer and employee interactions."}
{"text":"I'd really like to give this place 4 or 5 stars for the pizza, and a 1 for service.  I've had nothing but terrible experiences at this location which is a damn shame for Upper Lawrenceville.  The fact that I keep going back should tell you how much I enjoy the pizza. 

Issues I've had with staff include but are not limited to: 

1) Randomly closing the doors on us AT LUNCHTIME and not letting us in when we could see that there were customers inside (this has happened to me TWICE) 

2) Aloof and rude employees not acknowledging when I'm standing at the counter and they're too busy chatting. 

3) Downright lying about the ingredients in the sauce because they were too lazy to fix their mistake and remake the pizza that they messed up. (they put pesto sauce on my pizza when I asked for white garlic. My significant other called them out on  this, informing them that I have a nut allergy and pesto will kill me. They still wouldn't admit their wrongdoing or remake the pizza)

4) Just today, an employee skipped over my sister and I in line and rolled his eyes at us because we wanted salads (which were small and terrible by the way).  He angrily shouted \"okay who here is gettin' a pizza?!\" without addressing us further than the initial eye roll. He then filled the next customer's order and proceeded to take 5 minutes to shuffle around and slowly pull out salad bowls, which were not hidden, but in plain sight.  Even though we ordered standard salads off the menu, he made us tell him what to put on these salads, and rolled his eyes even more when we told him to add garlic, because that meant he had to pull out a knife and cutting board. 

Long story short, there's a reason that this location is rated 3 stars versus the downtown location which is currently rated at 4 stars.  If you're in Lawrenceville and you want a delicious, quick, cheap pizza, be prepared to deal with dishonest, angry, aloof employees (there are a few good employees, but they're far outnumbered).  Oh, and don't bother with a salad.

EDIT: CHANGED MY REVIEW TO 4 STARS FROM 3 BECAUSE THE SERVICE HAS IMPROVED."}
{"text":"Delicious flatbread pizzas that you can completely customize - what's not to love?! You choose everything from the bread to the sauce and toppings, then it's baked fresh right in front of your eyes. The best part is there is no limit to how many toppings you can add. For only $8 a pizza, it's a bargain for a very filling meal. The restaurant itself is very clean, and the staff were so friendly and welcoming. This might be my new addiction!"}
{"text":"What a great new concept in pizza.  Fast casual and delicious too.  In the same concept as chipotle and noodle, V3 let's you tailor your own flatbread pizza and it's hot and ready in just a few minutes."}
{"text":"This location is ok. I really like the one downtown so much better. Pizza was cooked too long making it difficult to chew the crust. Not worth complaining because the toppings were still fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Wow! Totally delish place in the concept and the food. Flat pricing and you can build your pizza to your liking. The choice of toppings is fantastic and you can add as much or as little as you like. Can't wait for the one on Butler Street to open since it's a close walk for me. Definitely a spot I like hitting when downtown running errands."}
{"text":"I love this place! 

I love the idea of paying a flat price for as many toppings as you want! I picked out a flatbread with all of the vegetables and mozzarella cheese. 

It was super delicious and I loved that you could choose garnishes for your pizza after it cooked. 

The staff could've been more attentive and kind but other than that, I will be back!"}
{"text":"V3 is mind blowing. The line during the lunch hour is very long, but the staff keeps things moving! They produce many customized, gourmet, flatbread pizzas per day. Even better - they're personalized and the perfect serving size for 1! The pizza, along with its wide array of ingredients, is incredibly fresh. They also have allergy friendly options which I was especially excited about. Being lactose intolerant, I'm often unable to eat pizza. As you can see below, I decked out my dish with plenty of mouthwatering toppings which would be a preferred substitute for cheese any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and good customer service. I would suggest this to anyone. The pizza I got was a bbq chicken Pitt pizza. Dang what a great for my stomach. Food prices are very low considering the area I'm in. If you like variety and pizza this is the place to give a shot."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this restaurant for the first time so on one of the coldest days in January, we called to order takeout at 7:00 PM. They said they couldn't take the order over the phone and to come in to place the order. Strange, but ok....  so we bundle up and head Downtown. We arrive at 7:38 and the staff looks up from their cleaning only to say they close at 8 and are all cleaned up. I said we called not long ago and were told to come down and they are open for 20 minutes yet. Silence. I asked why they didn't tell us on the phone they couldn't serve us. Silence. No apology. Nothing. They refused to serve us. I tried to contact the management online through the website but zero response. No matter what the food is like, their behavior and lack of any apology is inexcusable, and the management clearly could care less. Will never return and will make sure I share this outrageous experience with others."}
{"text":"Was happy with the build your own pizza options with a decent selection of sauces, toppings, and finishes after it's been cooked. There were also a handful of off the menu creations. Went around lunch time and although the line didn't seem very long it still took about 20 minutes to get through and out the door. 
Three stars for the length of time it took and because the crust was a little tough. 
I will probably return though to try out some more pizza topping combinations, but give myself some extra time. Oh, and the 8 dollar flat price is nice too."}
{"text":"I'm not sure who owns or manages this place but it's a hot mess. I highly doubt it will be open in a year despite its strong opening. It's addition to the neighborhood hasn't been fantastic and it's quickly built a reputation for itself due to negative employee behavior and erratic hours.  

For example, on multiple occasions, I've gone in to get the family their individual pizzas for dinner. Staff closed early. There is no rhyme or reason to when this place is open. They just lock the doors before the closing time and clean up. No note posted, no reason. It's ridiculous. 
Another time I attempted to enter and they told me they were closing and to leave. 

The other issue is consistency. There is none.  There is the potential for a great product but this location is all over the place. Sometimes they serve my kid a pile of mushy bread. Other times the crust is burnt and hard with toasted toppings.  I don't understand how something that is a chain and that should run smoothly is falling apart so quickly.  

What I do know is this- despite having liked the convenience and concept of this location, I'm tired of wasting my time & money going here. I won't be returning."}
