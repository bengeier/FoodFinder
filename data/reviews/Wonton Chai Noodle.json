{"text":"Great place for dumplings and brisket noodles, we tried their wonton, dumplings, beef brisket, fish balls, and crispy fish skins....we love them all.  Wish we could live closer so we can eat there more often."}
{"text":"My definite go to wonton noodle restaurant in the area. Their wontons (along with dumplings/fish paste etc) are always fresh and made well / consistent . And for that price (5.5 for one ingredient, 6 for two) you are getting an ample amount of good food.   Service is like any other Asian restaurant in the area. The restaurant itself is a good size - never have to wait for seats/food.   Hits the spot every time"}
{"text":"cheap yummy and fast!!  I don't go to this place for the excellent service or because the atmosphere is great.  I got for a $5.5 dollar bowl of beef brisket + dumplings with noodles. It's a good price and it's they special in. I could go to surrounding restaurants but it's certainly not as good.  You can buy their hot chili sauce and frozen dumplings. 6 pcs for $5. That's kinda robbery. I rather just eat it fresh!  Hope this helps, -jT"}
{"text":"- First time visited this location - Sunday around 5:30pm - quiet - Price reasonable - Soup base - not flavorful enough, I had to put vinegar and chili oil - Noodle texture - a bit soft - Wonton - I could feel a lot of MSG - I would recommend the one at Sheppard location"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here cause the food is cheap, and tasted really good. HOWEVER recently after taking a bite into a delicious wonton, I saw two large dead beetle under it. Needless to say, I discretely asked them to change it to some other dish, but they refused?! I heard stories of it happening to other people, but never experienced it myself. I've never been back since. I don't get why the bad attitude cause I was always a good tipper $2 for a $4.50 meal.  Also would like to add that the tables are always sticky. I ask you, how hard is it apply soap and water??"}
{"text":"Yum! I love a good bowl of wonton noodles. Wonton Chai is always reliable for a quick and cheap meal - you can pretty much get in and out in less than 30 minutes.  I typically order wonton with rice noodles, and it's an ample amount of food in a bowl for me. If you're feeling especially hungry, you can always order 2 or 3 toppings with your noodles, or a bowl of wontons/dumplings in soup on the side.   Prices here are a tad higher than some other wonton noodle places, but it's not too bad considering their wontons are big and plump!"}
{"text":"This is an in and out kind of restaurant. You get your food fast, eat and then go. There is tea at the corner area that you can pour for yourself.  What's so good about this place? The food! My fave is the wontons. They are huge! They definitely don't sting out on the ingredients."}
{"text":"Food is ok, similar like Jim Chai Kee but more expensive, very bad service, rush us even just seat down, keep coming to asking what do we wanna order, I don't even view the menu yet, that's so funny, after we put down the spoon, they come to clean up everything for us. I m understand if they are busy, but not, around 5:30pm, only four tables ppl, no line up, I don't understand why, so HongKong style, I won't be there again!"}
{"text":"First off parking is terrible at this plaza, but I know it is not their fault. I have been to another Wonton Chai Noodle house before and thought this would be the same.   Same thing rating for food, service, and ambience.   Service 2/5 - people are nice, but they give the feeling of rushing us to finish. Also the menu is very limited and they some how still manage to miss my order of noodles.   Food 1/5 - giving it a one because I didnt even get my food and I am not the type to ask again and again for it because I am the one giving you buisness. It is not my job to keep track of it. The vege plate in my opinion was small and very very oily.   Ambience 2/5: rushed and not a pleasant place to eat for me. Good for people that want a quick eat!   Closing- I just want to let everyone know that these are only my own opinion and different people have different opinion. Anyways I will never be coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"This place is great if your just looking for casual, quick tasty bite. Yesterday I went and as soon as I ordered , a minute later the wontons came. The wonton are huge and are a great deal especially since you usually get 6. The noodles are OK same as anywhere else and the beef brisket is pretty good as well. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"delicious.  had shrimp wonton and brisket soup with egg noodle and was very good and filling.  came very fast and very hot.  tea was served before... complimentary.  definately would go back."}
{"text":"I have gone here a few times for a quick meal. Today, we ordered the beef brisket noodle in soup and dace fish ball noodle in soup with the choice of egg noodle, rice noodle or vermicelli. Both were good and satisfied our hunger for snack time. 2 pho places are in the making right beside it, so you may want to check it out before you're tempted by the others."}
{"text":"Perfect place to have lunch and everything done right ! Tried their soup with egg noodle and three toppings as suggested by other members and really loved it !"}
{"text":"I had the wonton and fish ball noodle. The portion is decent, wonton is huge. The noodle taste great, but the soup was a little salty for me. Great price!"}
{"text":"Beef brisket and dumpling lo mien was excellent.  Beef was exceptionally tender all the way through, even the lean pieces.  It's sauce, like the soup was tasty and not over-salted like many places.      Dumplings had good tooth and you could taste all the ingredients.   A solid bowl, only thing lacking was I  wanted more.."}
{"text":"Consistent delicious goodness as the other location(s).  Can't go wrong with their wontons."}
{"text":"When I have craving for dumpling soup, I come here since its close to my home area. You come in, simple service, simple food. Grab a seat, you serve yourself water or tea. I got two items with shrimp wonton and fish paste meatball. I put some chilli oil and flakes in there to make the broth stand out better. ($6) its alright of a deal. The shrimp wonton is nice and plumped, and the fish paste meatball is not bad as well.  I did inquired how much it would cost to purchase a pack of their shrimp wonton, and the lady mentioned its $11 for 10 dumplings or something. That's pretty pricey I think, but then again, shrimp price has increased in supermarkets...  I would come back when I have the craving, or I can always go to Brimley Centre Mall up-stairs for that too.  (btw they close at around 7PM, so if you are wishing to come for dinner, you have to come before that...And I believe they only accept CASH!!!)"}
{"text":"It's my husband's favorite spot for quick and tasty food.  As for me.....it misses the mark.    A few pros: The noodles and broth are yummy Service is so speedy.   Free tea! cheap!  Some cons: There's a distinct baking soda taste in the shrimp wontons Dumpling and meatballs are rubbery and often overcooked Terrible fish balls!  For me, I like to enjoy the dumplings.  So a nice broth and noodle doesn't cut it.  Sorry to say, I don't think it lives up to the 4-star hype."}
{"text":"Best soup noodle store you must go try it I like the three kind of toppings noodles because all are tasty!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Mississauga. It is perfect for a quick lunch under $10. It's pretty simple... You choose your noodles, then toppings... inside your broth or soup on the side.  We ordered Shrimp wontons, Lo mein and soup on the side for 6$. Which hit our table in 5 mins after we ordered. The soup was perfect. The shrimp wontons were HUGE and obviously homemade. The portion size was well worth the 6$.   I give this place 5/5 because of the fast service, the delicious HOMEMADE food.. for such a cheap price! A must try if you live in Sauga"}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood and popped in for a quick lunch. Service was fast and effective. The food was delicious. The dumplings were really good. I had three toppings on lo mein.  The pork in tomato was good but not my favorite. I would definitely recommend the dumplings. Also, the food was ready super fast!"}
{"text":"I'm so excited that they are in Mississauga. They just opened and I'm loving it.  Good food, good service, and good prices."}
{"text":"I love Wonton Chai Noodles!  Fast and worth every penny (though you're not going to be paying a lot!).  I don't know about you, but I'm extremely pho'd out - but there's not a whole lot you can do if you're looking for an inexpensive noodle-fest.  Wonton Chai Noodles to the rescue!  If you're looking for a large variety, go elsewhere.  They make shrimp wontons, dumplings, braised beef and fish balls with or without noodle soup and a veggie side dish.  That's it, but darn it, they do it well!  The portion sizes are just big enough, and the wontons are HUGE!  As my mom would say, they're the size of a baby's fist.  Everything is so flavourful and abundant, you can't help but feel satisfied.  The service is also fast!  You get your meal within minutes of ordering, which is great because whenever I go I'm usually craving their food, so the faster the better!  I'd guess the average visit is around 20-30 minutes, which is great for people on the go, especially during lunch hour.  If you're a fan of wonton noodles, I highly recommend you go!  Note 1: For now this place is CASH ONLY!  Not sure if they plan on installing credit/debit machines.  Note 2:  If you fall in love with this place, like I did, you can get packaged wontons to freeze and make at home."}
{"text":"Got the wonton noodles but it was very bland soup.  The wonton themselves were ok.  Service was very crappy though.  Rude, abrupt and exasperated.   The servers were young guys who should work on their manners and get off their phones."}
{"text":"You don't have to be Chinese to know that these Wontons are the real deal!  I've been coming here for quite some time, with the occasional diversion to competitors just to get a feel of the Wonton scene in Toronto.  These Wonton are just perfect. A thin, silky exterior shields a delectably tender shrimp stuffing. The Shrimp is not over processed like some other places. Because we all know that no one likes a rock hard wonton!  Service is fast. I always take out, and from the time I place my order to when I receive it, it always clocks in at 3 minutes or less. Pretty impressive.  When I took out today, however, I was disappointed when I saw that my container was only 3/4 full of soup, when usually it is closer to the rim. I called them, they asked me to come back, but at that point I was just too hungry. Hopefully this will be resolved for next time around.  Oh, and don't forget to get the Red Vinegar and Hot Chili Oil. They are totally necessary for the ultimate Wonton experience!"}
{"text":"Clean, quick service, good noodles with large dumplings for a good price."}
{"text":"Wonderful bowls of wonton soup! Inexpensive, simple and yummy!  Your choice of noodles, and wonton!  Huge wontons!  They also sell their made in house chili garlic oil....mmmmmm."}
{"text":"We both chose the Two kinds of toppings with egg noodles for only $6.50. My toppings were the Dumplings and Dace Fish balls and my hubby had the Beef brisket and Shrimp wontons. The Dumplings and Dace Fish balls were big! They were a generous 1 1/4 \"- 1 1/2 \" in size! I have never seen wontons that big in any Chinese restaurants or eatery.  It is not the small portions that you find in asian grocery stores. They were fresh and tasty. The broth was perfectly seasoned and not overly salty or peppery. You can choose your selection with or without noodles. I chose egg noodles and there was a lot in each of our bowls. I tried the beef brisket and Shrimp wontons which were very tasty too and also big and meaty like my Dumplings and Dace Fish balls.   I took off one star because the place was busy so we agreed to share a table and they accept only Cash. However service was very fast. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Wonton noodle is good except the soup and wonton is overly salty. Price is reasonable and waiteress are friendly."}
{"text":"3.5 on yelp? it's so underrated!!!!!  Couldnt find better Cantonese Style Wonton Noodle Elsewhere in North America."}
{"text":"Basic. Simple. Delicious hot wonton soup. enough said."}
{"text":"Yum! Came here on a busy Saturday afternoon and there were a few parties waiting but we got sat within 15 minutes. I got the shrimp wonton and brisket with egg noodles and my boyfriend got the same but with rice noodles. Maybe it's just personal preference but I'm not a fan of the egg noodles they use - it's the crispy fried kind that are popular in Vietnamese dishes I'm also not a fan of. Next time I'll be getting the rice noodles. The shrimp wontons were amazing!! They must be stuffed with 3-5 shrimp each and take a few bites to finish. You get 3-4 per bowl. The broth is great and livened up by the chili oil on each table. I would recommend getting an order of the vegetables with oyster sauce to share between 2-4 people with the noodle soups, as they don't come with any vegetables besides green onion.   Service is quick and efficient. I left happy and stuffed!"}
{"text":"It is recommended by a friend.  There aren't too many people here on a Sunday early night.  We order mix toppings.  Wonton and beef brisket, Wonton and minced fish paste, and dumpling noodle.  The wonton is hugh.  It is the size of a ping pong.  It is very tasty.  The minced fish paste is smooth and does not have a fishy smell.  The beef brisket is not that great.  The beef is a bit tough and a lot of fat floating on the soup.  Overall it is a cheap, fast and family restaurant.  I think it is also a place for MSG lover."}
{"text":"This is a great place for beef tendon white noodle with soup a side, egg noodle are great too We enjoy it very much and close to 404 exit."}
{"text":"Ordered the egg noodle shrimp wonton soup. Tasted great on a cold autumn afternoon. However the service was less than stellar.   We were seated right by the front door (a spot the regulars avoid- which we found out after getting hit by the cold air every time the door opened and by scanning around the room to see everyone else sitting away from this particular table). Soon after a table was being cleared beside us and away from the cold drafty entrance, we asked to move to the empty table, when the waitress suddenly insisted it was already taken (which it wasn't). We looked away in surprise and understood the waitress was saving specific tables for preferred regular customers. She then surprisingly, asked if we wanted to move to another table - we moved soon after.    After receiving our food we were them approached by the waitress and asked if we could share our table with other diners. We were surprised once again considering we were there with friends enjoying a conversation. Bewildered we politely said no. We were again interrupted and asked again if we could share our table with other patrons due to peak hours. Begrudgingly we agreed since at this point the waitress made it seem like we had no choice.   We ate our meal, paid the bill and quickly left.  The restaurant needs to put up a large sign at the main entrance stating it is a communal restaurant and to be prepared to share assigned tables with other diners. We felt it was a very intrusive experience overall....."}
{"text":"i was craving some dumlings after watching some mukbang vids on youtube. i fucking broke down and ubered to this spot post yelp research. i was at my moms house in etobicoke high as holy sunday but i said \"fuck it, i gotta go\". i got there and i started to get paranoid bc it was one of those places where it's only the real ass chinese people in there, and they'd be looking at my baked ass thinking that i shouldn't be in these parts. i got there and pointed at some other persons order and i was set. it'll fulfill the innuendo, for you pervs reading this - ya, the dumplings are huge. vinegar and hot chili oil got me all sweaty and touched my food boner ever so nicely. the real ass chinese patrons were mad impressed with how i chow my dimplings, honestly shoutout to great wall on youtube. they were shocked, truss me. but yeah, this place is pretty great. only bummer is they don't fuck with apple pay or tap or cards for that matter, so bring some of that cold hard and you'll be nice~~~"}
{"text":"Very authentic Hong Kong wonton noodle place.  The noodles wereperfectly crunchy and the wontons were filled with shrimp.  Have it with fish balls and a side of veggies, life's good!"}
{"text":"The noodles and soup broth here is the best and my favourite compared to any other Chinese noodle restaurant. Portion sizes for the wontons, dumplings etc are also very large, well worth it for the price."}
{"text":"If you're craving noodles and wonton, this is a good quick place to drop by for a noodle bowl.  Food is served quick and great value for the portion you get.  The wontons are huge with lots of filling and there are many options for different toppings."}
{"text":"Honestly the best beef brisket noodle soup I've had so far! The broth is not to salty and the brisket has just enough fat on it."}
{"text":"Came here on day two of there soft open.  Tables are off to both sides, with a wide area in the middle.    Noodles were fresh, not over cooked, good soup base.  Dumplings and wontons are huge.  Will have to try other combination; beef brisket etc. Fast service...but then, such place are meant to be a quick meal with fast turn around etc. Will return as I like that we have a casual noodle place north of 16th, just off 404!"}
{"text":"This place is not bad, definitely not as good as Jim Chai Kim (Richmond Hill). The rice noodle is a bit too thick as it soaked up the soup base rather quickly, and the beef brisket was a bit too dry. I also tried the wonton and dumpling, they were mediocre as well."}
{"text":"Okay let me start by saying holy wontons are huge and good. Perfect broth . The noddles where cooked perfect not soggy. There wait staff is great super fast this place has a great turn over .   Place is very clean . They also have the best chilli sauce that you add to your own soup. There prices are low but the portions are large. This might be the best deal in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Finally a spot to get some good wonton noodle soup. Saw this place when I was picking up pizza for the family.  I took a chance and tried it out and took home a wonton and dumpling in noodle soup. And I'm telling you that the first time I took a bite I was hooked.   I never sat down and eat in cause it was a bit small but if you do expect to be sitting with other patron in the place.   Price is not to shabby either I got two soups just under 12$. I recommend trying this place out. And it does get pretty busy on the weekends but the wait is not that long. I will always be a retiring customer."}
{"text":"Had the brisket noodle with shrimp wonton - this place gave me the runs and I won't be returning. They have everything pre-prepared and serve it to you a second after ordering...goes to show you how fresh the food is.  Giving it 2 stars because the portions and price value are great...but quality isn't on point. You need to add Chili oil for flavour otherwise it's bland as hell. Personally, I would prefer Vietnamese Pho over this Chinese soup noodle experiment ANY day.   Oh yeah...and they don't accept Credit / Debit..cash only..."}
{"text":"Came to wonton chai for their impressive dumplings. We ordered the wonton noodle soup. The dumplings were AMAZING. Both the regular dumplings and the shrimp dumplings were stuffed with shrimp and delicious. I thought the soup base had a weak flavour and clearly heavily seasoned with MSG. Maybe next time we will try the Lo Mein option which has no soup base. They also sell the dumplings by themselves."}
{"text":"Best for when you're looking for something warm, simple, and quick! Wonton Chai is my go to place for wontons on a chilly day. If going with a few people, we would each order noodles with different toppings, so that we could trade and try different things (also much cheaper than combinations).   Wontons (4 in 1 order of noodles) - my favourite, lots of shrimp, and flavourful  (5/5) Dumplings (3 in 1 order of noodles) - just a longer version of wontons, less shrimp as there is some wood mushrooms that take up the space (3.5/5)  Dace fish balls (4 in 1 order of noodles) - a little on the big side, I would prefer half the size, also lots of fish bones, be careful (3/5)  Overall, 4/5 because the noodles wouldn't be enough if someone had a bigger appetite. Adding noodles would be an extra $2, not worth it to me. Also, the bones in the dace fish balls is pretty dangerous as usually there are no bones in fish balls. Be careful!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat in Mississauga.  It's cheap, fast, and the soup is as good as it gets (the only thing I've had here is soup and a side of Chinese broccoli, but the menu is small and lo mein made from the same basic ingredients is the only other option).  For their soups, you get to choose what type of noodle and what kind of toppings.  For me it's always egg noodles, shrimp dumplings, regular dumplings (seafood), and beef brisket.  The dumplings are the best I've had anywhere.  They appear to make everything from scratch, including the noodles, and even have their own chili oil in canisters at each table.  It's spicier than your average, but also possibly the best I've had.  This food here is simple, but it is really, really good.  The only thing to be aware of is that when they are busy, you may be asked to share a table.  If that bothers you, be forewarned.  If not, enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best wonton noodle places I've been to. It's cheap and delicious.  The location is great right by the t and t plaza. The location itself is actually very small. It's no good for parties of 4 or more really. They have mostly 2 person tables and 2 bigger tables. Take out is always good too. They do take over the phone orders.  Most of the food items are between $6.50 to $8.50. They have egg noodle, rice noodle and vermicelli. If you want extra noodles it's $2 extra. You can get 1, 2, or 3 kinds of meat.  I really recommend their wonton rice noodle. It's certainly my favourite! Their chilli oil is the best I've ever had. You can actually buy your own jar for $10 to take home. I would defiantly recommend it if you're a fan of the spicy!   The take it packaging is also on point. They separate the noodles from the soup. Also include the chilli oil and vinegar  for your enjoyment."}
{"text":"Best Wontons in town! Everything has lots of flavour, and the dumplings and wontons are huge!  Everything is fresh and they have an open kitchen! The prices are more than reasonable! Service super fast!"}
{"text":"To start off, I ate two bowls of this and a plate of veggies.  This place is located at a plaza located at the corner of Brimley and Sheppard. Parking is scarce but just enough to accommodate the amount of people coming in.  The restaurant is a typical Hong Kong style noodle house where you walk-in, order from a simplified menu of select noodles and appetizers and go fetch your own drinks at the communal tea dispenser.  I ordered (two bowls of) Wonton Noodle soup with a side of steamed veggies with oyster sauce. Once you order it took them literally 1 min to get the food out. It's simple for them to make and serve this as all they need is a big tank of soup made early in the day and Wonton dumplings made fresh just prior to day start. A minute of boiling the noodles and dumplings and then pour the soup and voila you're done. The dumplings were big, which is the main reason why i come here. For $5.50 for a bowl of this is totally worth it. Other places will charge you about $7 for a bowl of more noodles and less/small wontons.   The restaurant is clean, simple and nothing too complicated. You walk up to the counter to pay when you're done as it is not a wait-for-server type of service.   For a quick lunch this is a place to definitely check out. It's quick, easy, cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"Very tasty wontons and loved their beef brisket, so yummy. But there food selections are soooo limited. I only eat wontons and the beef briskets from this place. But they are excellent. One thing in mind, do not take out the wontons, learned from my most recent experience that they will leave the wontons in soup which greatly impacted the texture of the wonton wrappers when you finally get to eat afterwards."}
{"text":"My goto place whenever I crave for some wonton soup. Perfect toppings at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"|| Must Try: Shrimp Wonton in Noodles, Shrimp Wonton in Lo Mein, Beef Brisket   || Rating: (10/10) Food, (9/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (8/10) Ambience, (8/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness  || My Experience:    Been a fan of Wonton Chai since their original Scarborough location, with this new Markham one being an upgrade. Whereas the Scarborough location was a bit more casual, with shared tables, self serving drink area, and great for a fast delicious meal, this Langham location is a bit less casual with better service.   First off, Wonton Chai has the, hands down, one of the best Shrimp Wontons in Toronto. Not only are the Wonton's giant, they are made fresh every day, with high quality ingredients and perfect balance of flavour. Each wonton is hand made in the restaurant, if you go during down times you'll see the chef's putting together the wontons in the shop.   Quality is always consistent, I've never eaten there are received anything less than top notch wonton's. The price is extremely competitive, especially with the fact that their food is such high quality.   If you're looking for Wonton's, look no further than Wonton Chai. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The shrimp wontons are huge. It's a good place to go to when you're feeling wonton. It is also located right next to t&t which i find very convenient!"}
{"text":"You honestly cannot go wrong here with whatever you order. Now that colder weather is coming around its definitely the time to get a nice big bowl of wontons or dumplings.  What they have is really simple, but they do it extremely well.   I recommend the dumplings and the fresh rice noodles. My favourite combination.  And all for a very reasonable price.  Be prepared to sit next to some other slurpers though, as this place gets packed!"}
{"text":"One of the best and most authentic wonton noodle I've tried since my Hong-Kong days!!!   Enough said!!!!"}
{"text":"I found out about this place on the insauga blog, listed as the #1 Asian noodle place in the city, so obvs I had to give it a try. I arrived on a Saturday afternoon and did have to wait a few minutes for a table - or they offered me the option of sharing with strangers at a big table, which I declined. They have a simple menu and really just focus on noodles, either in broth or dry with sauce. There are also a few side dishes.  Egg noodles with shrimp wontons in broth. Damn, that broth is fragrant! It lives up to its name with a herbal infused broth that goes beyond the basic chicken broth typically used in this cuisine, it was quite foreign to me and very pleasing. The portion size looks small at first but those wontons are really packed with shrimp, have a tender texture and rich taste yet not heavy. I was a lot more full than I expected.  Beef brisket (one side order for our table to share). The brisket is very savory without using sugary or rich sauces - I would almost call it bitter, but the taste is so traditional and pleasing that I would eat it again and again.  Prices here are dirt cheap (around $6 per dish). Reminder, it's cash only. I'd come back for my noodle fix again. Not the best place to bring people unfamiliar to Chinese cuisine given the limited menu, but once one is familiar with the taste, I'd bring them in to try."}
{"text":"This place honestly doesn't disappoint! I've been here multiple times already, and have probably eaten everything on their soup noodle menu. Most recently, I had the beef brisket noodle. So tender and flavourful!   Definitely a great and cheap meal!"}
{"text":"Definitely better than average wontons and noodles, but their menu variety is lacking and after a few times I stop wanting to come since it's the same thing over and over.  Restaurant is quite small but I've not had to wait to eat here since the turnover time is quite quick.    I eat small portions, so the meal size is definitely enough for me, but I imagine typically one might want to add noodles to get full.  Note that add noodle option is +$2."}
{"text":"OK, came here on a whim. Was craving old school beef brisket and lo mein in soup for quite a while now. And this place was on my radar since forever. I was a little disappointed in the portion size of the noodles in the soup. But I noticed in the fine print that you can add extra noodles for $2. The beef brisket was also lacking in quantity but tasted alright. I had fond memories of this place when it was across the street in the power king plaza but this visit didn't hit the mark. Wontons were good though."}
{"text":"Good for a quick bite. Easily worth the money.   Food: 4/5 Simple and well done. Service: 3/5 Fast but does not check up on you. Environment: 4/5 Clean and quiet. Washrooms: 4/5 Clean and wheelchair accessible. Worth it?: 5/5 Good Value.  Fast little noodle shop. Menu is short and simple. Shrimp wonton soup ($6) seems to be their best seller and I can see why. A bowl of their special  comes with 4 giant shrimp wontons (very flavorful) on a bed of egg noodles.   There is not much for drink choices but there are  plenty of other places in the same plaza for that. They also have a \"Buy Fresh\" menu where you can buy dumplings or fresh noodles to take home and make yourself.   I would definitely be back when I am looking for something quick and affordable. Going with the first menu item (shrimp wonton noodle soup) is definitely the way to go here."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try Wonton Chai Noodle since the plaza was first built. I'm a downtowner and now that I have a project in Markham, I get to try new joints back in my old hood :D  WCN is simple and straight forward noodle soup and they are the best bang for your buck. I tried the shrimp wonton and brisket with egg noodle soup. A good sized bowl, very flavourful, came with 3 huge wontons and a few good pieces of brisket... All for a flat $7.50. That's a steal! I added a touch of their chili oil and it was perfect on a cold snow day. Definitely try this place of you're in the area. I'll be coming back for sure!  Note... Their chili oil is pretty awesome. They're sold at $6 for a small and $10 for a large."}
{"text":"4.5*  Holy wontons. These guys put my homemade wontons to shame.  Whether you get wontons or dumplings, they are HUGE. Don't be fooled when you count only 4-5 wontons in your bowl. Their portions are big and filling. Not to mention, super fast and super cheap.   Tea is served, so for under $10 bucks taxes in, you've got a piping hot, comforting meal that will have your belly wishing it had room to indulge in another bowl.   Seating can be hectic, as they're a fairly small establishment. The restaurant is usually full, so be prepared to join a table, if you're in a party of 1-2."}
{"text":"Overall a great new addition to the neighbourhood!  Food: Nice big wontons.  Fried fish skin portion size was good and vegetables were good as well.  Need to try the brisket and dumpling next time.  Price: 1 type of topping $6.50, 2 type $7.50.  Fried fish skin $6.  Vegetable $3.50.  Place: New, spacious, clean.  Comfortable seating, much better compared to Wonton Hut.  Only bad comment would be the flies that was borhersome during our dinner.  Service: very quick service and polite."}
{"text":"* Food is great  * Place is under decorated but looks clean * Well priced menu with great portions. * Average service and can get very busy at times"}
{"text":"Wife and I were craving some wontons and noodles.  This spot has been on our to go to list for a while now, so we figured we'd finally make a stop in and visit.  Service : the service is quick in the first 5 minutes..the staff would barely give us a chance to decide what to order staff came by our table and asked 4 times in less than 5 minutes.  By the time we were ready to order, then their attention wavered, took us another 5 minutes just to flag someone over.  Self serve on your beverages (water/hot water/tea)  Food : we ordered the shrimp wonton lo mein and the dumpling lo mein.  In future, we'll likely order the noodle soup version of those 2 dishes..since they basically charged an extra dollar for the use of the bowl to have the soup on the side.  $7 for the lo mein version, $6 for the noodle soup version.  The soup broth was simple, lightly seasoned and decent amount of scallions.  For us tho, not enough noodles, almost considered ordering a 2nd dish of lo mein or shrimp wonton noodle soup (btw $2 extra if you want extra noodles).  Impressed with the size of the dumplings and the shrimp wontons.  We found the shrimp wontons and the dumplings to be to our liking, plump and juicy shrimps.  Food for thought : would return for future visits if looking for a quick bowl of noodle soup.  Not likely to hit up this place if we were super super hungry.  Even after my wife and I were done our lo mein dishes we were still hungry for more.  Similar concept resto to Jim Chai Kee, similar size wontons. Not sure why tip is needed honestly..other than serving the food order..they don't do anything else for the customer..beverages are self-serve.  Payment of bill : Cash ONLY!"}
{"text":"They have made their name making wonton noodles. There's not much on the menu except the various combos that you can make with different noodles and toppings which keeps it simple and easier to decide than compared to other Chinese noodle places where you see 100s of items listed.   I had the wonton and beef brisket noodle soup and my daughter had the wonton noodle soup.   Mine came with 3 wontons and some beef brisket for $1 more and hers came with 4 wontons. The wontons were massive and the shrimps were crunchy and well flavoured. The beef brisket included a couple of pieces of tendon and were also very tasty. What distinguishes a good noodle vs a crappy one (like when I make it at home) is the noodle is crunchy. The noodle here was crunchy. Perfectly done.   I would definitely return.   Note, the restaurant is small and if you are a couple, you might end up sharing a table with another couple and slurping noodle with total strangers, Hong Kong style. However if you are shy or have never done it before, it could be an issue but the quality of the food is well worth it.   $6.50 for one item with noodle soup, add $1 more if you want 2 items like I did and another $1 for the third item."}
{"text":"Good spot for a quick and cheap meal. Would recommend getting their specialty (wonton). Family friendly, maybe not a place for a first or second date. But the food is good so it's lit."}
{"text":"My favourite go-to for a quick and easy lunch. I don't mind sitting alone here since the turnover is so fast. I usually get the shrimp wonton with egg noodle soup and put a spoon full of chilli oil in. I'm not there for the service but the ladies there do want to work efficiently- I never see the chatting and they are focused on the customers. The shrimp wontons are huge and made in house. This place has a close place in my heart; I often crave it because it reminds me of my mom's meals. Bonus: it beats hangovers!! Hoping that the owner can incorporate Ubereats or SkipTheDishes because there are many customers who would love it delivered!"}
{"text":"My go-to place whenever I have a craving for soup noodle. Place is quite small but there are plenty of seats so you won't have to wait. The place is always clean and tidy, and the restaurant has a very cozy atmosphere. Once you take a look at the menu, you have a lot of options to choose. I usually order the \"Three toppings with egg noodle in soup\", which is in my opinion the best bang for buck. You get 3 wontons, 3 faced fish dumplings, and 3 seafood dumplings. The egg noodle is perfectly cooked all the time, and the fish soup is also made in house (one of my favourite soups ever). Service is quick and responsive, you will spend no more than 30 minutes in there, so it's definitely a good place to go if you're in a rush.   What's good? - those amazing succulent wontons are hand-made in house and are amazingly delicious...they're also the size of a ping pong ball - soup is so delicious, and tasty - service is good - prices are super good, you can get a wonton noodle soup for around $5  What's bad? - not their fault but the plaza's parking is horrendous. On a busy day, it's impossible to find one unless you park underground and walk all the way up  Recommendation: yes!!!! Highly recommend if you haven't been...you'll never stop going there, as it is super addicting"}
{"text":"This is a great place, good good and fast services. Everything are fresh and delicious and good size. I am a regular and would highly recommend it. I love the wonton, dumplings and meat sauce."}
{"text":"My mama always talks about how much she loves eating at Wonton Chai. She literally raves about it to everyone LOL so I decided to go eat lunch with her at her fave restaurant. We came on a Thursday at around 1pm. It was busy, but a table left right when we got there. I ordered the beef brisket ho fan noodle in soup. It's one of my fave noodle soups! It took a little bit because the dish came out. About 15 minutes. When they served the noodle soup...oh my gawwwj the aroma! It was a chilly day so this was exactly what we needed. The broth was delicious, not too salty. The noodles were cooked perfectly, and the brisket was just tender enough as well! I hate it when the brisket isn't cooked long enough, and I have to tear it apart like a savage  This was so good!! I completely understand why Mama raves about this place.   Mama always brings home dumplings from Wonton Chai when she goes there for food. So I already know how amazing it tastes. Apparently they make their own shrimp wonton and dumplings!! No wonder it tastes so fresh, and so flavourful. She orders her fave dumplings noodle in soup, and wow the dumplings tastes even better when it's freshly cooked!! Definitely recommend everyone trying their wontons and/or dumplings!"}
{"text":"If you want a really quick meal, then Wonton Chai Noodle is the place to go.  It was my very first time that I ate here. When I sat down at my table, a lady immediately came and asked what I wanted to order. I haven't even looked at the menu yet and she was pushing me to order something.   You have to get your own tea here and your order will come in less than 2 minutes which makes it even faster than american fast food. If you have a party for 2, get ready to share a table with other customers.   The soup wasn't that hot in terms of temperature and the noodles were just ok compared to other noodle stores like Jim Chai Kee that I've been to. I ordered the shrimp and mushroom dumplings on the side. They were massive and had a lot of filling in them.  Overall, basically its order, eat and leave."}
{"text":"Best shrimp wonton, multiple locations. Prices are great as well for Chinese style wontons. Wontons are huge! They can also be purchased separately uncooked (a dozen shrimp wontons for $12)."}
{"text":"I love coming here in the afternoon for a quick and hearty bite.  The Beef Brisket Lo Mein is by far my favorite. It comes with wonton soup on the side. The noodles are chewy and the Beef is tender, soft and full of savory flavors. The portion is fairly small in my opinion. 4-5 pieces of beef brisket and a handful of noodles with a bowl of soup with 3 shrimp wontons.  On the weekends it's usually busy, tables are always full but they open up quickly. Sometimes you end up sharing a table but the servers are fast to take your order and bring out the food."}
{"text":"Best wonton noodles in the city !  Reasonable price, quick service and competent employees. Restaurant interior is always clean and tidy.  They handmade  their own wonton and  make their own xo sauce.  Love this place and would recommend to anyone hungry ;)"}
{"text":"Love their wonton noodle, and highly recommend their homemade chilli sauce! Qua reminder: they take cash only."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Seriously. 10/10. The girl taking orders is sweet. You must get the 2 topping of beef brisket and wontons. The sauce they use to cook the brisket in mixed with the wonton soup = PERFECTION. If you can handle spice, then dumping a few spoonfuls of the hot sauce is the way to go. Also a splash of the red vinegar. You will be in heaven, believe me. For my short 3 day trip, I came here twice. I would go here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner if I could. COME TO THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"The price is amazing and the portion is right. I wish they would offer more toppings for the noodle soup such as beef ball, roasted duck, crispy pork, or Bbq pork, etc.  The noodle and noodle soup are average because of MSG. Their crispy fish skin is not so good since it is pre-fried and served cold."}
{"text":"I was blown away by how good this place is. $5 for 4 huge shrimp wontons with egg noodles in a delightful tasting broth can't be beat. Noodle soup is what they do and they do it well!!!"}
{"text":"Came here to eat brunch. Had the tomato chill sauce pork lo mein with wontons on the side (ja jerng mein). Portions were decently sized. Noodles were cooked just right, I hate when wonton noodles are overcooked. Just the right amount of sauce. However, their soup and wontons have too much MSG (where the sweetness comes from). I wouldn't drink the soup. But other than that its pretty decent. Minimal service. Pay at the desk. My total came to about $7! :) good price IMO."}
{"text":"4.5* The best shrimp wonton soup served with either egg or rice noodles!  The wontons are really big. Great price. Their home made hot sauce is very good.  The service is fast. A definite must try."}
{"text":"OK - I used to work in Richmond Hill and go to Jim Chai Kee for wonton noodle soup. Since switching jobs, I haven't been able to find anything similar. Until now. Wonton Chai Noodle is very similar to JCK and I am soooo happy I found it on Yelp!  I had the wonton noodle soup, which was amazing. My husband had the beef brisket noodle soup. Good, but a bit fatty. We also got the vegetables with oyster sauce (perfect) and dried fish skin (not for us).   We will definitely be back for wonton noodle soup and veggies!!"}
{"text":"This place has really nice decorations with mirror making it look spacious.  The grey tile matte flooring also very clean.  The wonton was full of fresh shrimp with a bouncy texture and noodles was also quite tasty.  The price is quite reasonable.  All the staffs are quite friendly as well.  Not bad at all.  It was a good breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is really busy as usual, but an interesting thing is that they don't have more table in the middle to serve more customers.  I wonder why, but I am not complaining because I like to dine at places with more space between tables. The service was average since it was a busy establishment.  The place is neatly decorated  The shrimp wonton was wrapped in thinnly rolled skins.   The fish soup base was light and flavourful with a lot of fresh diced scallions.  The noodles was a big no no for me.  It was slightly on the mushy side when I expected my usual bouncy al dente noodles.  It was really subpar, because noodle is the star of any noodle place.  When I crave for shrimp wontons on Wednesday when Jim Chai Kee is closed, I guess there is not really a better alternative."}
{"text":"Mississauga/Creditview-Portions were half what they were last time I came. Food is nothing special. Service was aweful. Server get annoyed if the spoon from the hot sauces touches any of your dishes and they come to the table to yell at you. Wouldn't go back. Guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Soup was good. Price is great. Only complaint I have is the portion size - I was still hung. Ordered a green vegetable on the side which was ok. Place was not busy. Good for a fast cheap meal."}
{"text":"If you want wonton soup...this is the place.  Order 3 topping noodle soup with shrimp wonton, dumpling and beef brisket with a side of vegetables w/ oyster sauce.  Broth is steaming hot and savoury, noodles taste fresh and wontons are big and tasty.  Just an overall good wonton soup.  Very fast service for a quick meal."}
{"text":"HUGE wontons, loaded with shrimp, amazing egg noodles, great broth, tender beef brisket, smoky hot chili oil - I honestly can't imagine how they could improve it!  If you're not asian, and 'wonton soup' has you picturing that thin chicken-dishwater broth with little soggy mystery-meat wontons from the chinese buffet, then are you ever in for A BIG TREAT!!  Authentic Hong Kong style wonton-noodle soup is a delicious jumbo bowl soup featuring a delicate savoury broth, loaded with 6 golf-ball-sized wontons, each handmade daily and stuffed with nothing but multiple whole fresh shrimp, perfectly cooked and bouncy.  You can also choose a combo bowl of 4 wonton+noodles (I recommend wonton with the thin egg noodles, a few drops of red vinegar, and a shot of house-made chili oil) or you can add beef brisket and/or fish-paste balls, or a side of steamed veggies with oyster sauce, as well.  Decor and service are both friendly but quite basic, but your order comes out lightning fast. Just enjoy your soup and pay at the cash on the way out, for a quick and easy, delicious meal, all for around $6!  If you've never tried it, don't let this winter pass without a steamy bowl of wonton yumminess! You can thank me later :)"}
{"text":"My first 5 star rating!    Some may think it's horrible but some may experienced the 5 star treatment.  It's cheap, tasty, and service is impeccable!  Jennifer K. did mention it's similarities to Jim Chai Kee and possibly the new Wonton Hut but I come to this location.  Not cause it's close.  I live at warden and highway 7.  I'm close to both.  I do work about 5-8 minute drive to Wonton Chai, which is relatively close but the service is the reason.  I come during lunch and they know my name and order.  I brought two Filipino coworkers and the owner and staff remembers our orders.  We walk in and they would shout in Cantonese, \"Same\" and we'll nod \"Yes.\"  We go 4-5 times in a month.  They know we'll be ordering a plain fish ball & wonton in soup, wonton and beef brisket with rice noodle, wonton and beef brisket with mien, and a plate of vegetables with extra oyster sauce.    You will have to serve tea yourself but it's a self service place.  Walk to the cashier counter to pay when ready.  They really don't expect much tip but I tip them according to Chinese standards, which is 10%.  My coworkers and girlfriend made fun of me but later realize the difference to west and east after multiple Asian cuisines I've taken them.  They're quick and you'll have just enough time to digest before work.  We'll, I don't smoke but great for my smoking coworkers.  Also, being a CBC, my Cantonese is horrible with a broken telephone accent.  Saves me from ordering and just saying \"Yes\" when I come in.  They do speak English!  There location is in a small plaza shared with TD Canada Trust.  Meaning parking can be hard to find during peak hours but I haven't had a problem after circling.  It is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Wonton Chai Noodle makes me glad that I'm chinese..  The service is quick, within a few minutes your order will be placed in front of you, no waiting and no other nonsense. There's no sense of complaining about the service.  For a fast-paced service, the food is delicious. The wonton noodle soup which is a pretty common order is filling because of the four huge shrimp wontons complimenting the noodles. The broth containing the wonton and the noodles has a good aroma to it.   Price wise, my wonton noodle soup was $5.50 (plus tax) and it is quite worth it considering its portion size. You have to pay up front, cash only.   The menu consists of noodle soup and lo mien which includes toppings from shrimp wonton to beef brisket and a variety of other things to custom your meal.   It's really the best place if you are starving to death or a cheap place where you could get mouth watering wontons. Even though the atmosphere isn't really used to other people, I love that everytime that I go there, there's a chef making and stretching noodles by hand on a table despite questioning its sanitary conditions."}
{"text":"This is what you would call a greasy spoon in chinese.  Very dirty and pretty good (I love their hot paste!  Probably the best in Toronto).  you have heard the saying what doesn't kill you will only make you stronger.  I can honestly say that I come here a few times a month.  Sucks to be the person who found some unwelcomed friends in their meal.  I guess I have been lucky or they were really unlucky.  Good value for the food.  Not much of a service place, pretty much a self serve(tea drinks)  I guess being in Hong Kong and seeing this place you tend to get that HK feel...=o)  Too bad it wasn't Hong Kong cheap ($10 HK for a bowl).  So go and enjoy a fast lunch of shrimp wonton noodle soup."}
{"text":"Came by this restaurant to satisfy my wonton cravings and I was definitely a happy camper when I left. The menu is small and there are about 8-10 choices for either noodles in soup or Lo mien style. You also have the option of switching the type of noodle to egg noodle, rice noodle or vermicelli.   The service is quick. We ordered and our noodles came out in under 10 minutes. The shrimp wonton was large and very flavorful. The noodles were also delicious. I would definitively come back to try the Lo mien to see if it's as good as the noodles in soup. :)  Overall, this place is a great go-to place when you want something quick and inexpensive. It is cash only so bring the monies and not credit."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Chinese restaurants in Mississauga. Had the beef brisket + shrimp wontons in egg noodle which only cost $5.50. The portion was large (the wontons are especially huge) for the price. Wait staff was nice and service was super fast (ordered and got my food within 5 minutes). The only downside was the price of the vegetables was a bit high for the small portion. Nevertheless, I would highly recommend this place for a quick meal!"}
{"text":"I don't like wonton... BUT i love their wonton... the size are GIANT!! fresh shrimp and tasty!! love it... beef brisket is tender and tasty also... love it!!! the fish ball need a tiny little more work (it's not bad, but not what i expected)... but you know what's my favorite!! the HOT SAUCE!!! they said they made their own and let me tell you... they are so good... so spicy, and so yummy... i think my family of 6 had a 1/3 of the container... AND we even bought some home too... if i have another chance to go back, i will buy 2 containers just for myself... :) so so so good..."}
{"text":"Delicious wontons everytime!   Noodles are served super quickly after you order and they have a good selection of beef brisket, beef, wonton, dumplings, fish cakes. You can pretty much customize everything you want (in case you don't want yellow noodles, can get the rice noodles, select one/two/three toppings) the broth is super flavourful especially if you get it with beef brisket. Healthier option would obviously be the fish cakes and wontons!   I see a lot of people order the fish skin as well so I presume that is also very popular. They also do take out at this location! Cash only. Reasonably priced wonton noodles start at $6"}
{"text":"TLDR; Waitress messed up, copped attitude and insisted we ordered wrong, tried to charge us more for food we didn't order, tried to make the excuse that it was busy (it was half maybe 2/3 full), served subpar food and insisted it was fine. Just... No.  I had eaten here a few times and found it comparable to Jim Chai Kee (in jubilee square) and my MIL was craving wonton noodles for mother's day so came here on the Saturday evening last week.   It started fine, we were promptly seated and the waitress was quick to take our order. In hindsight should have asked her to repeat the order but she said \"okay so total 6 items\" which was correct so we just said yes.   The food came out promptly too, and the first bowl was fine, the second bowl was wrong. They gave us wonton noodle soup when we ordered wonton lo mein.  So we politely told them this isn't it and sent it back. They simply poured the soup out, put the noodles on a dry plate and re-served it. As you know, noodle soup and lo mein are different, the noodles are supposed to be much drier when served lo mein style. They insisted it was fine at first but eventually relented and then served us wonton lo mein properly.   During this time, a third bowl came fine along with our veggies but the last bowl was wrong as well. They got fed up and brought the order bill over and claimed that was what we did order. Basically insinuated we were trying to pull their leg. The entire table of 4 adults had heard my husband order and he ordered exactly what we wanted. (His Chinese is only so-so so I always listen to him order carefully to make sure he didn't mess up)   They eventually served the correct item after much heated discussion and we ate and left.   We noticed the portions have decreased, less noodles than before and the soup is not as flavourful as when we first tried it. (This was noted before they messed up)   Such a disappointing meal especially since it was for mother's day and they got her meal all wrong and then gave her attitude for it.   Am never coming back. Go to Jim Chai Kee."}
{"text":"I love uncrowded, cheap and delicious restaurant finds.  I love wontons, I love fishballs, I like beef brisket, and I absolutely adore Chinese noodles in its various forms.  This place has it all!  $4.50 for a bowl of rice noodle in warming soup with 4 large wontons.  Extra for a plate of Chinese lightly boiled Chinese veggies.  Simply slurpy and delicious.  The home made chilli sauce is kick-ass and you can buy jars of it at cash to take home - $9 for a large jar and less for a smaller version.  The service is QUICK, and though the mostly Chinese speaking servers can seem a bit abrupt, I'm going to forgive them as I don't think the attitude is given out of mean-spiritedness.  Pay at the counter and grab your own tea!  It's located in a crowded random strip plaza that would be easy to miss if you drive too fast, so pay attention!"}
{"text":"Affordable Chinese comfort food. For $6 you can get a bowl of noodles with both shrimp wontons and dace fireballs. The quality of the wontons, brisket, and fishballs is quite good where they are prepared fresh and large in size (very few other locations make wontons this size with the amount of shrimp that they do). As per the typical Asian fare, you can also order sides of vegetables prepared steamed with oxyster sauce on the side. However will note that it is part of a busy plaza with a small parking lot so just be wary of that. Overall, great for just a simple menue for that basic Chinese food fix."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick meal.   $6 for simple wonton noodles doesn't hurt the wallet either.   The wontons were packed with two pieces of whole shrimp each with a total of 4 wontons in the bowl.   The noodles were done well, great texture and not too soggy.     Definitely a good contender when you want something to quick for lunch."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with my family.  I always like jumbo shrimps dumpling so wanted to try it out.  Seating is comfortable, better than many other similar places.  Food is ok, I had better at other places."}
{"text":"The food was at great value, portions were good. Noodles was perfect and everything was perfectly seasoned. Why I gave it a 3/5 was because of service. I came with my family of 4 and before I even got to fully take off my jacket (I have to help undress 2 kids) I was already asked 3 times as to what I would like to order and suggestions were being made. My Cantonese isn't the greatest so I had no idea what they were saying. When I asked for water, they also came in styrofoam cups. I cant imagine the harm they are doing to the environment in order to save time from washing cups? The shrimp wontons were huge and juicy and the vegetables were perfectly boiled with just enough sauce. The experience felt a little rushed even though it wasnt that busy on a Saturday afternoon. I did see a whole group of them eating lunch after so perhaps they were trying to rush us?"}
{"text":"Really impressed with their wonton and noodles. I ordered the Shrimp Wonton with Dace Fish Ball noodles and Beef Brisket Lo Mein. Noodles were cooked perfectly, wonton was nice and plumped full of flavor. Beef brisket was a bit tough, but still packed with juices and paired very well with the lo mein was definitely my favorite. Loved how soft the dace fish balls. Paid only $15 with tips for two dishes, tea and water was free ofc. Highly recommend this place, can't wait to come back and try out the other dishes."}
{"text":"Great bang for your buck! The wonton noodles are super al dente, and the shrimp wontons are really fresh! Great for when you want a quick lunch (you can be in and out in about 30 minutes)! Try the fried fish skins (let them soak in the soup to bring out some more of the flavour) if you'd like a little something extra - kind of like fish chips!"}
{"text":"I went for an early lunch with my parents at Wonton Chai Noodle recently.  Their specialty, you guessed it, is wonton noodle soup.  They do it well indeed!  I got the \"noodle in soup\" with 2 toppings ($6.50).  I chose shrimp wonton and sliced beef for my toppings and egg noodles for my type of noodles.  My dad also had the \"noodle in soup\" but had 3 toppings ($7.50) - shrimp wonton, dace fish balls and beef brisket and egg noodles.  My mom had the \"lo mein\" with 2 toppings ($7.50) - shrimp wonton and beef brisket.  I liked my soup.  I got 3 huge shrimp wonton.  The wontons were quite possibly the largest wontons I've ever seen.  They were almost bursting with shrimp filling.  Each wonton contains 1 large whole shrimp surrounded by ground up shrimp.  The wonton wrapper was nice and thin.  The wontons here are fantastic!  The sliced beef, while plentiful was rather chewy.  I liked that the meat was lean and not fatty, but it was too chewy for my liking.  The egg noodles were thin traditional wonton soup style noodles.  They were nicely cooked.  The broth was flavourful and not too salty or oily.  I would have liked it if I had some vegetables in my soup.  The pictures on the menu show some greens in the noodle soups, but I didn't receive any.  My parents both enjoyed their meal.  They too commented on the deliciousness of the shrimp wonton.  My mom's meal came with some Chinese greens.  I guess that's why the lo meins are more expensive than \"noodle in soups.\"  I mean they seemed to me like basically the same thing except the lo mein has the broth on the side while the \"noodle in soup\" has in all in one bowl.  Maybe it's because they have to wash an extra bowl.    Anyway, service was not the friendliest, but they were very quick and efficient.  No one was rude, they just didn't smile or seem warm/friendly and it seemed like they wanted to get us in and out as fast as possible.  If I were paying big bucks here I would have been offended, but since our meals were so cheap, I found their behaviour amusing.  We had our meals less than 10 minutes after we ordered.    The restaurant is a casual eatery with not much décor to speak of.  They have a place in the corner where you can help yourself to water or tea.  All beverages are served in Styrofoam cups - I'm not a huge fan of this for many reasons (environmental, health, etc.), but whatever.  There is a sign that says if you use more than 1 cup a person, they will charge you $0.25 per additional cup (?!), so yeah, I guess if you drink tea and then want water, you either have to pay $0.25 or use the same cup.  After you're done, you have to go to the cash register to pay.  The restaurant is in a strip mall.  There's lots of free parking.    I would come back for the shrimp wonton soup for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time as my mother would always say her friends praise this place a lot. I ordered the Shrimp Wonton & Beef Slices Lo Mein. Truly a great dish. The wontons were big and filled with full shrimps, not cut into pieces. The beef was cooked to a medium to medium rare and it was perfect. It melted in my mouth and was so soft in texture. A few things I'd change would be the portion size and the wait time. . The amount of noodles for a single is small compared to other similar restaurants. Overall, still loved the food and location."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write a review for this place for quite a while, I have just been too busy enjoying the food. For price, quality, and service I have to give this place the five stars.  This not going to be the place you go for a special occasion it is not that type of place, but it is the place you will go three to four times a week for great food. Some people might not like the fact that it is communal seating so when it gets busy you might have strangers sitting at your table. I love the communal seating I wish there was more of it say hi to someone, make a new friend!  You have a choice of:                 - Egg noodles.                 - Rice noodles.                 - Vermicelli.  Choice of meats:                 - Shrimp wonton (Huge, tasty, homemade).                 - Dumplings (Huge, tasty, homemade, my favorite, lots of shrimp with mushrooms).                 - Beef slices (Like in pho, lovely slices of beef, great texture).                 - Beef brisket (Have not tried yet, looks like larger chunkier cuts of fatty beef).                 - Dace fish balls (not bad, homemade and quite big).  You can have your choice of noodles and meat in a soup, or with the soup on the side. Whatever you pick you can't go wrong, with the fall, and winter approaching I will be going here a lot.  P.S. The chili hot sauce is crazy good, just be careful most of the heat is in the oil......be careful, I mean it!   You can always add more, but you can't take out what you have added. Hot sauce is for sale if you like your heat this stuff is nice!"}
{"text":"Goodness all in one bowl!  Fast, simple, delicious and cheap!   I chose the two kind of toppings with noodles in soup.  -shrimp wontons  -beef brisket  -$7   Best shrimp wontons i've had. Wontons are huge! Texture of the shrimp is bouncy, and each wonton is filled with big pieces of cut up shrimp. Juicy and flavorful!  The noodles are thinner than the usual ones, they're fresh and every bite you take theres a nice crunch to it.  There were three big pieces of meat/tendons. Meat was tender and the tendon was soft.   Great portion size. If you want extra noodless, its $2 extra. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some fast and cheap wonton noodles, then this is the place for you! The menu is very simple, there are two types of noodles - soup noodle and lo mein, and you can choose to add wonton, dumpling, beef, fish balls or brisket. The noodle + 1 topping starts at $6. Service is very quick here, your food will come pretty much within 5 minutes of ordering.  This is one of my top go to places when I want something cheap and quick t o eat!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, there is no comparison to Jim Chai Kee. Their wonton here isn't as good, and the shrimp is very small compared to JCK. Service is horrible as well, they are not friendly at all. Some customers came 15 minutes before they close, and they turned them away because the kitchen closed. Horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"Ordered Noodle in soup dish, with rice noodles and shrimp wontons.  Food was okay. It came out in a decent amount of time, however, there was this loud buzzing alarm noise coming from the kitchen throughout my whole stay. It was as loud as a fire alarm, very unpleasant.  Like no one was doing anything about it. It ruined my meal. Wouldn't come back just because of that."}
{"text":"Wow!! Wonton-derful tasty soup... Absolutely ginormous dumplings and al dente egg noodles in a tasty broth...  You can take your pick of 1, 2, or 3 types of dumplings in your soup and 3 types Of noodles or none at all.    The shrimp dumpling and 'dumpling' dumpling (a nice combo of shrimp, mushrooms, and pork i think) were tasty and fresh made, no doughy soggy dumplings here!!  The dace fish ball was okay.  Didn't try the beef options.   If you feel like wonton soup come here!! $5.50 for a soup that eats like a meal.  You can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"This place is a True Definition of a Well Run Asian Restaurant.  I usually come here on the weekends and it is ALWAYS PACKED but trust me you will not have to wait long for a table. It is a small place and if you are comfortable with sharing a table with people you do not know then you will usually get seated right away.  I personally love this because it forces you to make new friends or you can choose to be antisocial and sit on your phone...writing a yelp review of course... haha!  You have a few options when you come here for Noodles and dumplings.  I always get the Shrimp Dumplings with Beef Brisket and it is always consistent and always delicious. The bowls are all one size and they are served super quick!  I absolutely love their homemade chilli sauce here which has a nice burn to it!  My tolerance for hot sauce is pretty high so beware...  You can also buy a dozen dumplings to take home with you and you Know I had to buy at least 2 dozen!  I love these dumplings!"}
{"text":"Hidden among the many Chinese businesses at New Kennedy Mall, this noodle shop offers the usual combinations of  wonton noodle soup, beef, beef brisket, fish balls, noodle soups and lo meins that most dedicated noodle houses offer.  I had their flagship product, the wonton noodle soup which consisted of a tasty soup, ample noodles and four huge shrimp filled wontons.  Although not your \"authentic\" shrimp-pork wontons the all-shrimp orbs were delicious.  The meal was filling for a fiver and offered proof once again that dedicated noodle restaurants are a cut above their full menu counterparts when it comes to WTNS.  Service is fast and friendly and your meal is delivered to you within minutes of ordering especially during the busy lunch period.  Seating consists of booths and tables."}
{"text":"My go-to wonton noodle place in Mississauga.  The wontons here are huge!  Portions are decent for the price you pay.  The noodles have the right amount of chewiness and great tasting broth.  I usually order the wonton and beef brisket noodle soup.  It is comparable to the ones you find in Hong Kong!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place love the food and the lines move quickly, the only thing is the costs have risen which I don't mind however the portions are smaller"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a $5 bowl of noodles. The menu is simple and displayed underneath the tabletop glass in front of you. The portions are good, the broth is clear, and the shrimp wontons are huge. The place is very clean and I have no complaints about the staff. This is definitely the best place to go if you need a quick, but delicious, meal."}
{"text":"This review is based on the wontons only. Service is fast and efficient. After placing your order, you'll be served within 5 mins.   The wontons here are packed with huge whole shrimp mixed with minced shrimp paste, which gives it that chewiness when you bite into it.  If you can handle the heat, try their store made chili oil.  I always say I'll try something else like the beef brisket or fish ball noodles, but end up getting the wontons every single time. Too good to pass up on!"}
{"text":"Delicious noodles and wontons. A friendly atmosphere and prices that can't be beat. The menu is simple and to the point.  Right off the highway, this is a hidden gem in the city. I thoroughly reccomend the stop."}
{"text":"My go to place for quick noodle soup.  Service is fast and food comes out fresh all the time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for Wonton. The wonton are very large and packed with shrimp. The broth is pretty light and flavorful. You can be in and out in 15 minutes and be very satisfied.  I highly recommend getting an order of vegetables with oyster sauce to compliment your soup."}
{"text":"Overall: 4/5  One of my favourite places to go for wontons and noodle soups! Great place if you're looking for quick service and quick eats.   Taste: 4/5 Menu is simple and direct, not a lot of variety but most people usually have a go-to that they don't stray from. Broth is delicious and hot. Egg noodles are pretty basic. The real winner are the wontons - large and packed with the goodies! They're well made and stay in tact even when cutting it in half or taking small bites first. I've tried a few items on the menu - dace fish ball noodle soup ($6.50), shrimp wonton noodle soup ($6.50), pork with tomato sauce lo mein ($7.00), deep fried fish skin ($6.00), and oyster sauce veggie ($3.50). Noodle soups were the best. I wasn't a big fan of the lo mein (too spicy for me), or the deep fried fish skin.  Service: 4/5 Service is quick and efficient; you're usually seated right away (if there is room). Ordered items come out within 10 mins! Turnaround is fast.   Ambience: 3/5 The space can hold up to 50 patrons when full (6 round tables at 6 seats each, 4 square tables at 3 seats each, and 1 table for 2 seats). Lots of in-and-outs as service is speedy and patrons finish their meal pretty quickly as well. There are 2 TVs in the space - don't really see many of the patrons watching it but have seen the staff stopping in front of the tv to watch it.   Tips:  - Located in a plaza with free parking  - Option to add additional noodles for $2 - Can order pre-made wontons ($12 dozen)"}
{"text":"Best wontons ever! The wontons are huge! The shrimp inside is always fresh and it's always juicy. The wonton is almost half the size of my hand. But also, I have pretty small hands.   I've been a regular customers for many years and never gotten around to write a review. The name was changed and use to be named, \"Jim Chai Kee\". However, it still tastes the same.   I always get the Wonton Egg Noodle Soup which tastes fantastic, as I said above how the wontons are just never the typical wontons you found get at any other Chinese restaurant. The egg noodle is not too uncooked or too over cooked that makes it numb, they cook it for the right amount of time so the noodles are just yummy. The Beef Brisket rice noodle is also a must try as well. Overall, all of their soup base is amazing as well. Sometimes when my dad is in that area, you can easily grab a dozen of wontons for around ten dollars to bring home and pop them in your hot pot or your own noodles.   The service is great, I always come back because of how welcoming the owner is and always thanks all of her customers with a smile. The price is pretty decent because of what they give back which is the best noodles ever.   Worth going and your money!  Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"I don't think the food could have been any better personally speaking.  I'm really picky about flavours but this place was the perfect portion size with clean flavours that told you whoever made the broth was passionate.  I got the noodle in soup with shrimp wontons and beef brisket. Also tried the vegetable with oyster sauce. My mom got the shrimp wonton noodle soup and said it was too bland for her taste. My sister got the sliced beef noodle soup which she loved and devoured.   I found the shrimp wontons to be perfect in size, containing juicy shrimp and overall very well seasoned. The beef brisket was very tender and full of flavour.   Add some chili oil to your broth - it is then perfection with perfectly al dente and chewy noodles!  The staff are straight to the point which I liked. Fast service and great cheap food. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Not bad! We came here from work to get a quick and cheap bite. I love how they are so fast and those shrimp wonton are HUGE. They are def. worth the money. I love the noodles too, they are just cooked perfectly.   My husband did complain that it's too small, but you can always add the additional noddle for a fee.   I will def. come back for more! They also have lo mein as well, which I will try next time I come."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst place i ever eaten so far. I would rather eat my poopekh than to sip on that boiling bathwater soup. Please, avoid disaster, dont go here. The hot dogs at the canadian tire across the plaza made by Yovar Mihailyov are at least 656x better. Thank you."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the only reliable Chinese restaurants in Mississauga.  Food is consistently good, service is always better than other restaurants in the area, price is affordable.  Food is always fresh. Although the menu is rather limited, they do what they do very well. Everything from wonton, to beef brisket, to fish balls, they know how to bring the taste of authentic Hong Kong toppings to Canada.   Service - Fast. It's really simple to order from the menu, so you can't go wrong really. You just tell them what you want, and done. Give it, 5 minutes maximum, and your bowl of noodles will be steaming out the kitchen towards you.   Price - Affordable. It's around $7 for your choice of noodles (Lo Mein, Ho Fun) with one choice of topping (Wonton, Beef Brisket, Beef Slices, Fish Balls). And around $8 for your choice of two toppings.   I love it here. I'll come back if I'm ever in a rush, or just want a good taste of Hong Kong."}
{"text":"I'm here with an updated and improved review!  I gotta say, this place has the most addictive wonton noodles.  They are known to be a franchise/chain restaurant of some sort.  Currently the only specialty wonton resto in Mississauga.  The other restaurants don't compare as they don't SPECIALIZE in it.  You have the option of getting wonton noodle soup with different types of meats.  You can also make your own combo. They also have dry noodles with soup on the side which are just as good.  The types of meats can actually change your dish so be weary.  In Mississauga, 5 out of 5 stars for a wonton noodle soup place. As a restaurant a 4 out of 5.  Here is the breakdown.  Price 5/5 - You don't need to spend huge like at Ruth Chris' for good food.  This place has food for $6-10 dollars a meal.  AMAZING! Food 5/5 Location 5/5  - Right by Bubble Republic, so if you want wonton noodles and BBT for lunch its very convenient.  Also by GO station for those after work commuters. Venue - 4/5 - Can get INSANELY hectic on a weekend morning/lunch for a small place like this.  They do it Hong Kong style and seat you with other people if there aren't enough seats.  As a Canadian resto, it can be a little weird.  Place is fair in cleanliness though. Service - 4/5 - Sometimes they can be okay, and sometimes they can be horrid. So this would be an average.  This is an absolutely must visit place if you haven't been yet."}
{"text":"No frills noodle soup joint.  Employees are very quick. Napkins, chopsticks and complimentary tea are towards the back of the restaurant. Help yourself. Condiments are on each table. Shortly after you place your order, a big bowl of comforting soup is placed in front of you. Pay at the cashier.  The menu is simple. They offer soups, lo mien and Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. Toppings for soups include: shrimp wontons, beef slices, fish balls and beef brisket. Noodle types include: egg noodles, rice noodles and vermicelli.   I'm still thinking about their shrimp wontons. They were so plump, juicy and packed with real shrimp. The broth is light and not overly salty. The rice noodles had a pleasant chew. Their serving size is generous and the price is definitely right at around $5 for most soups.   Wonton Chai Noodle is simple and comforting.  Cash Only."}
{"text":"Wonton Chai is a quick and simple noodle place with their basic menu! Their options aren't plenty nor is their decor anything fancy because people just come in and out of this restaurant to eat. A simple stop like a gas station when you're on a long road trip, except you get to chow down on their delicious noodles for a cheap price!  Their menu consists of soupy noodles or dry noodles with a bit of sauce at the bottom and a side bowl of soup, it is stated as \"Lo Mein\" above.  The noodles comes with wonton (shrimp dumpling), beef brisket, or dumplings. Their dumplings are the water dumplings, also known as \"??\" or \"Suey/Sui Gao\" in Cantonese and \"Shui Jiao\" in Mandarin.  I got simple Wonton noodles in soup! They have condiments on the side, so naturally, I'm going to add spice, heehee. Really standardized Wonton noodles, or \"Wonton Mein\". Usually comes in the form of the yellow noodles and big juicy pieces of Wonton.  This is the Beef Brisket in vermicelli noodles, as they ran out of the rice noodle. The rice noodles that they use here are the thicker, fatter ones.   I'm not sure why it's a thing, but whenever I eat Wonton noodles, it's like a thing to get side vegetables, with hoisin/hoi xin sauce at the side. I believe these vegetables are \"kai-lan\" also known as Chinese Kale. The vegetables help provide a crunchy bit towards the meal - I like adding vegetables towards my meals as well so it's a good combination!  Wonton Chai is a simple place to eat this very simple classic Chinese dish of Wonton, Suey Gao and Beef noodles. Service is quick and tables are pretty big. They don't have small 2 seaters, but instead have big round tables to fit about 6 people each.  There is also tea at the corner for you to self-service, with paper cups. In some simple noodle places like this, they have this style of service. Unless you come with more people, then they'll provide a teapot.  Wonton Chai is definitely a hidden cheap eat gem which most people don't know about because it's not exactly in a popular location, etc... But the meals here are easy going and simple. So don't expect much and enjoy the simplicity of a classic Chinese meal!"}
{"text":"Just like hong Kong style.  Including the heavy MSG haha  Price is $6 for wonton noodles, while Scarborough same restaurant charges $4.50"}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant if im ever craving a delicious bowl of wonton noodles. I mean noodle soups are the only thing on their menu but that's what they specialize in and it's super good. Basically, they offer noodle soups with these choices: wonton, dumpling, fish dace ball, and beef brisket where you have the option of choosing up to 3 toppings. Each of the toppings are made fresh daily from scratch so you'll expect to get bigger portions, all of which are very tasty! The wonton noodles are made to perfection,  not overly cooked but \"chuy\" as they would say in Chinese meaning \"crispy\". You can also choose from the type of noodle either egg noodle (wonton noodle) or rice noodle (ho fan noodle).  Great service and the food comes out promptly. If you are looking for a quick lunch, you can be in and out in 30 minutes.  Depending on the amount of toppings you choose, a bowl of noodles ranges from $6-$8.  They even making their own chili oil sauce which you can purchase to take home: $5 small bottle or $9 large bottle.  Its always packed during lunch so expect to share a table with other patrons.  The restaurant is located in a plaza with No Frills and other restaurants but the parking lot is pretty big so you should be able to find parking easily.  Overall, a cheap and delicious noodle resto so come here if you're looking for a quick fix especially on a cold winter day."}
{"text":"Love the open concept! Food was really good. The wontons are pretty big. Decent price. I find that the quantity could be a bit better..ie: more!! At a convenient location with lots of parking. Downfall, when waiting not much room to be standing and waiting."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't tried this joint earlier on. Definitely impressed. Dumplings and wontons are huge and flavorful and actually filled with shrimps... clean shrimps. They were also cooked on point - not soggy but very \"bouncy\". The beef brisket were tasty, soft, and tender. Most importantly, the noodles were al dente. I must emphasize how much I HATE soggy noodles. As well, pricing here is super reasonable with the size. Service here is quick and normal, like any chinese restaurants (cha chang tang). This place definitely satisfied my cravings. I'll be back for sure!! Soon..!!"}
{"text":"Still great as ever! They added the fish skin! It is AMAZING. For $6 the portion was massive, the skin was crispy (for days), pairing it with the broth was more than memorable. The lightly salted skin tasted fresh; very much like chips! I want some right now as I think about it. Come for a piece of cheap goodness! Drooolls...."}
{"text":"Came for lunch today. Ordered the beef brisket soup noodle. Others got dace fish ball soup vermicelli, shrimp dumpling soup vermicelli and oyster sauce choi sum. The food is ok, soup was a bit salty and oily. Portion sizes are bigger than when they first opened. Ok for a quick meal, parking situation is not very good, not enough spaces."}
{"text":"There aren't many fantastic wonton noodles houses in the GTA. This is one of just a handful in Toronto; however, if you're expecting HK caliber, then you'll be ute to be disappointed.   Short of a 20 hour flight, and if 20 minutes is all you can spare for a one-way commute, then this will do."}
{"text":"I've been here only twice. The most recent better than the first. Odd how something so simple could be so inconsistent. I'll upgrade to 4-stars if they are able to deliver noodles that are el dente and consist to my enjoyment.   (As an aside. Why aren't noodle houses in Toronto who claims lineage from HK able to deliver quality of noodles and brooth to same as those in HK? Is it because our noodles aren't made with goose eggs? Is it because the noodles aren't made by hand and offered fresh? Or is it because they are missing the \"fish\" ingredient in the brooth? Or is it made with our lake water that isn't delicious as the water in HK?)"}
{"text":"Amazing wonton noodles.  Their wontons and dumplings are enormous, flavourful and mouth watering. It's a small place, but worth it if you live within 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I live about 5 min from here.  If you want something simple, cheap, no need to think type of meal, come here. The menu is super limited but has enough for you to choose from, ... the fresh wontons are tasty and wont disappoint. And the pricing ... well, the pricing is just perfect for what you get. You can't complain and it gets you filled.  A bowl of wonton noodle soup with a plate of steamed veggies and oyster sauce on the side will run you about a total of $10-12.  Probably a lot healthier then eating fast food."}
{"text":"Always my favorite place to go.  They got the best wonton soup noodle in town.  Been going to their Scarborough location, but since I moved from the area their second location is just a good. Clean, fast service and the meal is always delicious for a great price!"}
{"text":"The wonton noodles here is as good as their 2 other locations. The only issue we've had with this location is that on 2 occasions, they ran out of ho-fan. The second time was on a Saturday afternoon. Come on! My mom didn't approve of how some of the staff was rude but then again rude staff at a Chinese restaurant is nothing new."}
{"text":"By far, the best wonton noodles I've ever had. Used to go to this place as a kid with the family. Went back to it recently and now I really understand what an outstanding bowl of noodles they serve. The wontons are the size of a child's fist. The noodles are firm and not soggy. I definitely recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Food is great and at good value. Very consistent in taste and portions! Quick service and definitely the place to go for wontons!"}
{"text":"Good price, good tasting wonton noodles, fast service. Don't go for the beef brisket though."}
{"text":"Wow what a wonderful surprise... I had been going to a legendary wanton place on HWY 7... and this was a newer addition to the area... so I thought I would give it a try.  I wasn't disappointed... Wantons were a good size and flavorful.  Noodles were cooked perfectly with some chew and crunch.  $4-8 is an amazing value for lunch.  For a full 5 stars I would want the Shrimp in the wantons to be more crunchy and the soup to have a little more flavor.  Going to compare at my usual place... but this might take over as my go to Wanton place as it has a number of other items on the menu that the other wanton place doesn't have."}
{"text":"Honestly, the noodles here is really good. However my last visit here was absolutely frustrating that I would never come here again. Certain places I don't expect a lot from their customer service including places like these (fast pace restaurants). So my boyfriend and I both ordered the same thing (3 toppings noodles). When our order came we noticed there was only 2 toppings so I told the waitress and asked her for my third topping. First, she said I should had asked once I got it. I didn't even touch the food?? You walk away so fast how am I suppose to catch that you messed up? She offered us to order the dumplings separately which essential cost almost $8 more. Even though she admit she was wrong she still couldn't offer us anything. It was the worst experience from both employees that was working and I would NEVER visit this restaurant again"}
{"text":"Best Wonton Soup in Mississauga! Such a bang for your buck with their massive dumplings and shrimp wontons and their beef brisket just melts in your mouth. For only $6.50, you'll have yourself a huge bowl that may just offer leftovers. Maybe. Their shrimp wontons are so tasty! And the chilli oil they make in-house is a tasty added touch. You won't be disappointed.  I only wish they had later hours!"}
{"text":"For some reason, this time, the shrimp wontons were not great. The shrimp didn't taste/feel fresh, like too much flour was used to coat. Real disappointment from my usual visits."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced, good sized portions, quick service (and I mean QUICK - our steaming bowls of noodle soup came out less than 10 minutes after ordering), and overall, a very comforting meal. The place itself is pretty clean, and there were many patrons lining up for take-out as well.   First, parking. Located in a plaza on the Northwest corner of Creditview and Burnhamthorpe (the plaza where No Frills, Sushi Tei, Bubble Republic, Chili Chicken House, etc. is located - right beside Erindale GO Station), there's a large lot full of spots. The plaza gets busy, but it isn't too difficult to find parking.  Second, the food. We ordered #1 - Shrimp Wonton Noodle in Soup ($6.00), and #3 - Beef Slices Noodle in Soup. Overall, hearty, warm, the egg noodles were skinny, chewy and a good texture. The wontons were generously sized with lots of meat, and they were very liberal with the amount of beef they gave me. The broth itself was definitely sweeter and fishier than I expected (I was told that they use shrimp shells in the broth - warning for those with shellfish allergies!), but overall, tasty and flavourful.   Not bad at all, and a safe bet when you're looking for reasonably priced comfort food in central Mississauga (this place is about 10 minutes away from Square One)."}
{"text":"This place is officially my favourite wonton noodle joint. I came here two days in a row and I'm still craving it. I've tried the wontons with egg noodles and white rice noodles and both re super yummy! The side vegetables are good too (except cold both times it was ordered).   Do yourself a favour and get the FRIED FISH SKIN. I know it sounds whack but it tastes like the best chip on earth.   I finished all the broth both times (probs tons of MSG cus I was super thirsty and groggy after) but the taste is worth it.  Definitely will be coming back... probably next week hehe"}
{"text":"Good place for a Pre-dinner Noodle if you're Ridin' Solo(DeRulo style).  Closes early so most of my attempts at coming here before was always SHOT down, as I come after 7 pm or so.  Simple place, straightforward Menu, friendly Cantonese/English speaking service, self-service Tea.  FYI, they will attempt Mandarin but it's as FUNNY as how I sound.  As Cook \"Wah\" makes my Wonton in Noodle Soup($4.50) in the OPEN kitchen, I looked at the menu which is pretty much a handful of items only.  Noodle with Oyster Sauce or Noodle Soup, then your choice of up to 3 items(Wonton, Beef, Fish Balls, Beef Brisket, Meat Sauce, etc...)  With only these few items, you can make quite a few different combinations that cater to your preference.  The Bowl comes out FAST with 4 big Wontons and normal portion of Noodle in a standard stock.  The Wontons are packed with Shrimp and pretty tasty and most people like to dip it in condiments such as the Red Vinegar or add Chili Oil for added flavour.  Bowls can cost up to $7.00 and you can even add extra Noodles for $1.50 for those big consumers."}
{"text":"I have never been to a worse restaurant. The attitude of the staff needs some serious work. I only came here because the congee place next door was full.   The food is extremely small portioned when I can buy a full out meal from other chinese places.   You are expected to get your own water/tea. No one serves you.   So i literally JUST finished my bowl of noodles w/ wonton. and the lady comes over and says \"so your finished right? go pay the bill\"   Excuse me but I didn't even finish my cup of water that I filled myself , and you're already telling me to leave? The food is something you can definitely make at home, perhaps a whole potful too instead a tiny bowl's worth.   Never coming back and spreading the word that this is the absolute worst place to eat at."}
{"text":"Favourite wonton joint! The soup base was very flavourful and shrimp wonton was fresh and crunchy. I tired the pick 2 soup bowl. I had the shrimp wonton and beef brisket. I loved it and will definitely be back. The pricing is great for the amount you get and perfect size for dinner. Please note they often close early. I came on Friday and the store was closed before 9."}
{"text":"Where has this place been all my life?!  It's the very definition of fast food but done with good tender-loving care.  The service so fast that it almost seems like the food arrives before you even order!  The food is presented with no fuss or frufru-ness.  Just really solid take on a bowl of wonton noodle soup.  Whether you get the shrimp wonton, dumplings, or a combination of the two, they are so delicious and gigantic!  The noodles are really chewy and have this slippery texture that makes it so easy to just slurp it all up.  If I didn't accidentally dunk my spoon of hot chili sauce (which packs a kick!) into my bowl, I would've drank all of that soup too.  The dining room is bright, clean, and almost reminds me of a food court.  The tea/water is self-serve and don't be surprized if you are sharing a table with strangers during their busier times.  Now that i know this place exists, I feel like I must make a stop to enjoy a bowl. :-)"}
{"text":"Winter is just around the corner, and there's nothing more hearty then a steaming hot bowl of noodle soup. My new obsession is Wonton soup, so I've been on a quest to find that perfect bowl.  I've gone to wonton chai (translated to Wonton Boy in English) numerous times for both sit in and take out. This place is dirt cheap, fast and absolutely delicious. For $2.99 you can get a bowl of egg noodles and broth - that's the vegetarian version of the soup. The noodles are cooked to perfection, not too hard, but not too soft. The broth is salty but not overpowering. Best of all the food comes literally within the minute after ordering.   The restaurant is very simple and no frills. It's in quite a popular local Chinese plaza in the area. it is often busy on the weekends, especially during lunch and dinner hours (the majority of the stores in the plaza are restaurants). Just drive carefully, and watch out. You may think you have the right of way, but just try to tell that to the guy after he rams into you.   Other than wonton noodle soup, there's not much else to the restaurant. For cheap, fast, filling and tasty food, try Wonton Chai!!"}
{"text":"Cheap. HUGE wonton. Fast. SO GOOD.   Their spicy chili oil is bomb too."}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp and saw it's great reviews and decided to check it out.  The food came almost instantly which was nice, however the soup was quite salty which was the only unfortunate part. Otherwise, the meal was alright."}
{"text":"Great bang for your buck! Friendly staff, delicious noodle dishes especially when you get shrimp wontons with it. Went here for Saturday dinner and wasn't too busy. Always perfect on cold days or when you feel under the weather or simply just craving noodles/ramen."}
{"text":"Food is decent but nothing too out of the ordinary (similar to some of the others).  But where things stand out for them is excellent service-even during the busy lunchtime period.  Very attentive and polite. Those looking for a quick and good meal should consider.  Parking is also very easy given the big parking lot.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"My 3rd time here.   Could use a decor upgrade.  Or At least turn up the light a little.  The place looks depressing.  Food: b+  Service: A- (calibrated for Asian restaurant standard)  Cash Only Policy with NO Sign: F-  Overall:  B-  Food portion here is not too big as usual western portion.  It is a food that gets to the point without extras or unnecessary fanfare.   When you walk out of here, you feel filled without feeling bloated, fairly satisfied that you paid so little.  My Gripe:    The place has no sign that says \"Cash Only\", yet when you go up to pay, you are verbally told cash only.   Grrrrrr.  I had to drive across the street to TD to pull some cash out and come back to pay.  This place wasted my time and gas.    Honestly, I am getting sick of Asian restaurants in GTA that insist on Cash Only policy.  Why?  The bank fee???  I think its about taxes.  Everyone should pay their fair share of taxes, so that we can maintain the services and standards of the community.   We all enjoy state services, including health care.    I get why in Asian countries, some restaurants insist on cash only;many of these countries offer very little service to the citizenry. But in Canada, we all receive from awesome state services.  Let's not bring Asia to the West(in this arcane and negative way), but adapt and maintain the standards of our new community that we call home.  No, I do not buy the excuse that cash only policy is bc credit card companies charge fees to merchants.  As soon as you pay cash, the restaurant gives no receipts.  Why???  Probably they don't plan to give the government tax owed.  We all benefit from the big pie, so lets not ruin the pie by our selfish ways.  Sorry for the preachiness folks, yet another Asian \"Cash Only\" place that wasted my time and gas had to be addressed."}
{"text":"Small restaurant in a strip plaza but don't let the appearances fool you.  Excellent value for for the food you receive.  The shrimp wonton are impressive, simply massive.  The brisket so very tender.  Simple food but extremely well done.  Expect to have share a table with strangers during peak times... Only negative thing I noticed"}
{"text":"LOL why my friends/fam love this place so damn much is beyond me. Well, it's nice to have a breath of fresh asian air in this mainly white-food dominated parking lot but this is not what I'd go to by choice, ever. The place is dark/dingy and the layout is horrible - they could've easily sat so many more people here if they got more tables but instead everyone is squished on the sides near the wall and there's this empty space in the middle that can double as a dancefloor. Yeah. Inefficient.  Service is quick and asian. By asian, I mean \"I'm not going to complain about it because I expected no service at all before I even came in\"  Food is very basic and simple. Tons of wontons mixed with cheap asian noodles, loaded with sodium and regret. Nothing special to the tastebuds. Little to zero on the vegetarian option side. Vegans, do not go here. There are jars of fish paste staring you down as you slurp your noodles down.  It's cheap and fast, but definitely not a first choice. Why is this so popular???"}
{"text":"Never knew why it took me do long to come here. They do basically 1 thing and they do it well.  Different noodles,  my carb of choice is\"ho fun\" the wife flat noodles. Sometimes I'll trade half my \"mein\" skinny chow mein noodles with my dining companion and mix both.   The wontons are big in size,  stuffed with shrimp,  outside isn't too doughy and full of flavors.   The hot sauce on the table is dangerously good.   Their system is easy,  yoy can build your own soup if you don't want to order one of their basic ones. Just add 1 item, 2 or even 3 and they will all run you under $10!  Winton/dumplings/meat or seafood balls plus a side of veggies or fried fish skin!   You gotta try it ;)  Btw be prepared to sit with others, family style, during their busy times!"}
{"text":"It's not no Jim Chai Kee, but it's pretty good.  I've been here multiple times, however I haven't gone to their flagship location at the langham plaza on Kennedy.   The soup base is okay, kinda salty. But who doesn't like salt? LOL  The wontons I found had a lot of shrimp and some filler. But the shrimp is still the star.  The beef was good, nice and tender.  Overall, it's pretty good. I'd come again :)"}
{"text":"Really satisfying and really cheap. The wontond are huge and the quality is better than any fastfood ones I've had - including popular places in China. The place is always busy. It is worth trying if you're nearby."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap food. I order takeout here on a weekly basis. I stick to the noodle in soup with 3 toppings. Their chilli oil is great, be sure to try it if you like a little heat. My spice tolerance is pretty low by the way but I still add about 1/2 teaspoon to my meal and it's delicious but bearable. I love their dumplings. They give a lot of noodles with their takeout, though I wish there was more soup.   Great little takeout place. I always call ahead with my takeout order and have always had someone pick up the phone within a few rings."}
{"text":"I'm a stickler for nice, comfortable & clean presentation and Wonton Chai's got it. Super quick service as to be expected for a noodle joint. Good deal for a bowl of noodles with two toppings - $6.00 only. Perfect place to hit up if you're on the go & just need to fill your tummy quickly but with a good eat!"}
{"text":"Warning.  This review is intentionally biased.  My rating is based on the fact that I would have walked out and have never eaten here had my fiancé not talked me around into waiting some more then actually eating here.  Wonton Chai is a small, Chinese run wonton place that has a small number of seats, simple decor and large portions of wonton and noodles.  We arrived hungry on a Saturday morning and there was a lineup. So we picked up a number in the queue and went out for a walk.  There was a dollarama in the plaza so we went to browse dollarama then returned to the restaurant 15 minutes later.  When we returned, the server told us that our number in the queue was called and we had to take a new number and wait some more.  I wasn't too pleased, but those were the rules so we got a number and waited at the restaurant.  After waiting the queue another 10 minutes or so, other customers were seated and our party of 2 was first in the queue.  At the is point, another family of 3 came in and picked up a number in the queue behind us.  About 5 minutes after that, a large party finished their meal and left the restaurant, freeing up a table for 6.  The server then came and asked if we wanted to share a table.  We declined, the other family said they were ok with sharing and the server skipped them ahead of us in the queue and seated them at the large table.  Unbelievable.  They didn't end up sharing with anybody because nobody else was in the line, but we had to wait some more.  I was now mad and ready to leave Wonton Chai.  My fiancé talked me out of it and we eventually got a table and ordered some food.  To be fair, Wonton Chai has reasonable prices, large portions and tasty Wonton and noodles.  I ordered the two item noodles with beef slices and beef brisket.  My fiancé ordered the two item noodles with Shrimp Wonton and dumplings.  The portions of food were large.  The prices were reasonable.  But poor service which cause our table waiting fiasco made me not enjoy the restaurant.  1.0 / 5.0"}
{"text":"I have yet to eat in at this restaurant.  I have had the experience of having take out a few times.  The reviews are accurate that the wontons are certainly large.  I have ordered the 2 toppings opting for brisket and wonton each time we've ordered.  It is quite excellent.  The broth could be a bit more savoury.  It is a little bland for my taste.  Not much more just a little bit.  Maybe if I used their hot sauce it might be better."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this location and it didn't disappoint. Huge dumplings and wontons.  The hor fun was just right the soup could be a bit tastier but it does the Job if you looking for a light meal.  Will go back once and a while, sure beats cooking yourself for $6 bucks."}
{"text":"Known for as their name says... Wonton Noodle Soup  If you are in the mood for good wonton noodle, then this is your go-to in Mississauga.  The noodles are chewy, perfect consistency, and broth is yummy.  Basics of good noodle soup.  They have a small menu, with noodles in soup (egg noodle, rice noodle, or vermicelli -- default is egg noodle if you don't say anything), or dry with oyster sauce (soup on the side).  That is basically their menu, and then you choose which toppings you would like.  Ex. Wontons, Dumplings, Fish Dumpling, Beef Brisket, etc.  Price is cheap, and portions are satisfying.  It gets super packed during peak times, especially on the weekend, so expect to wait in line."}
{"text":"High quality and fresh ingredients. Once you try the noodles here, it is hard to go back to other places like congee queen. Fast and efficient. Restaurant is extremely clean.  Like the others said, there is msg. The food always tastes so good. But I'm currently still thirsty 4 hours later. So I kind of regret it. I always am super thirsty after, I have get a sense of regret. Maybe I  shouldn't eat their next time... it's a vicious cycle of good tasting food and thrust. Try not to drink too much soup and order the lo mein to avoid the msg/ soup."}
{"text":"I'm a big noodle fans. And if you are from Hong Kong. Eating here is A must. They use the big fat white noodles unlike some other restaurant using some skinny white noodles. 90's music in the background definitely bring back some memories. The wanton has more meat less shrimp than J.C.K. But they give more noodles.  Overall, I would come back again, they have more varieties. Will try some other stuff on the menu next time."}
{"text":"This place is a nice cheap eat. The menu is limited but they do it very well. The dumplings and broth taste great and would be perfect for the winter. The staff is fast and efficient. It's also cool that you can see right into the kitchen. The beef slices for the soup was the only let down, I think you should order the brisket instead. I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Just out at the edges of Richmond Hill's treasure trove of Asian restaurant is a single noodle joint floating in a sea of big chain restaurants.  There are times when I am passing RH, and don't have the time or inclination to detour down into the Beaver Creek area--Wonton Chai is an oasis just when I need it.  I had one of the many wonton noodle soups on the menu at a great price.  Served quick, hot and very tasty, it confirmed for me that this will be a place that I come back to many times, simply because travelling further to RH without a very compelling reason is not necessary. Thanks for saving me the gas mileage!"}
{"text":"I work at a car dealership, even my managers (white/brown), they love the big SHRIMP BALLS aka WONTON from this place. Their food quality is always the same (generally because they are fairly easy to make)  If you like Chinese food/soup, go to this place, you won't regret. They have the best wonton in Toronto I would say.  They only take cash tho."}
{"text":"Rating: 1.5  On this very cold Saturday night, Vivian decides to come to this restaurant for some good and delicious wonton noodles. She was very excited. Little did she know, her experience there would be a bad one.   First off, one of the workers was definitely a punk. I don't know what it was about her, but the way she handled situations and her attitude was just like stupid and irritating.   Second, this is just a personal thing of mine, but I absolutely HATE having to share tables with other parties. It's so awkward and uncomfortable. I can't even talk with my fam/friends in peace. LIKE NO NONNO  Third, I ordered the Shrimp Wonton Noodles and that was the most meh wonton noodles I have ever tried. The soup/broth was tasteless. It barely tasted like anything seriously. As a result, the noodles also tasted like nothing. OH, and I don't know but the noodles here were kind of thinner than compared to other wonton places? I didn't like that. Anyways, for the shrimp wontons I didn't like them either. They were probably the most flavourful (a lil too salty even) out of everything. I appreciated the fact that it was big like good job guys, but man the taste did not do my tastebuds justice. I literally ate like 2 1/2 (out of the 4) and was like \"imma call it a day\". It was seriously like a mission trying to finish them. Luckily I got help LOL but still. I think what really threw me off about them was the saltiness and the amount of sesame oil (at least that's what i think it is?!) like damm chill on the sesame oil guys pls  Last thing, even the god damn tea was terrible. It was SOOoooOOo diluted and it also had a slight soapy taste too like great I love washing down my food with diluted, soapy tea leave juice. thanks a+.   ANOTHER LAST THING. I want to end this review with one good thing about them so here I go. Your order comes out pretty fast. Das it.   **it seems like there are apparently flies that like to chill around the place. luckily i didn't encounter any. i have someone who constantly gets attacked by an army of flies and yeah, didn't see one near her w00t"}
{"text":"After freedom noodle closed down, I needed a new wonton place to satisfy my cravings. I found wonton chai noodle on yelp and decided to give it a shot.  I ordered the double topping (wonton and beef brisket) with egg noodle in soup. $6 for one topping, $6.5 for two and $7.50 for three.  Upon receiving the bowl, I instantly regretted not adding extra noodles ($2 extra).  There was very little noodle even though the bowl was big and full of soup. The wonton is decently sized and tasted fresh.  The shrimp was cooked to perfection. However the beef brisket was a complete disappointment. It was too hard and chewy. I'm not sure if it was just that day or if it's like that everyday.  My friend tried the dumplings which was also a good size and filled with shrimp and black fungus.   Menu is limited to 5 different toppings and 3 different types of noodles. You can also order it in Lo mein style or order the toppings on its own.  They also sell the toppings raw but the price isn't exactly cheap ($12 for a dozen wonton).   If you're only looking for a quick wonton noodle fix then this is the place."}
{"text":"Mississauga and Markham have a mean game on Chinese food. The wonton soup here is one of them. A proper healthy sized wonton w three shrimp in each. The shrimp is not minced. It's chunky and curled inside the happy shaped wonton. This wonton is 1.75\" in diameter. Two to three bites a pop. Excellent broth. The kind that cures your cold. They also have an INCREDIBLE beef stew type soup. The beef is brisket w a mix of tendon-Nerves in chunks that is sooooo soft w a slight effort of chew on the tendons. The beef will fall off itself w the help of gravity. The thin noodles below are dressed in the beef sauce. This place has excellent wonton and beef tendon soup. Don't ever go! ......(besides my belly)"}
{"text":"Been looking for a place with good shrimp wonton noodles, and finally found it! A bowl comes with a good amount of egg noodles for one person, and 4 shrimp wontons. The wontons are pretty big, and sweet and flavourful. The egg noodles have the perfect amount of chewiness, and the broth is very flavourful with a generous amount of sliced green onions.   The lo mien is also quite good, and they give you a good sized bowl full of broth on the side for your noodles.   You can also get a decent sized plate of veg with oyster sauce for $3.50, if you like to have veggies with your meal.   The service is extremely fast, and for $6-7 a bowl, you can't get much better in Mississauga. This is clean cut, no frills, Cantonese comfort food.  1 star taken off because of the inconvenience of only accepting cash."}
{"text":"From photos that I saw on Yelp, I kind of expected more or at least bigger wontons but unfortunately, I found it on the smaller end and they even skimped out on the wood ear (a type of fungus) that they used to add in it. Also, I found some small bones in the fish ball that I ordered; I would definitely caution parents with little kids to maybe wait till their kiddo is a bit older before having him/her tackle that fish ball. I ordered my soup noodles with rice noodle (ho fan) and I found their rice noodles was a bit stale-like?! I have definitely had fresh rice noodles before and the texture is less firm compared to the ones that I had today.  What saved this review is that I found the service super quick. Literally within a minute after I placed the order, the waitress returns with my order. I LOVE THAT!!! I don't know if that's the \"usual,\" I was here for lunch on a weekend so maybe with the weekend rush they are super prepped.   For the cost that I paid, I am not going to complain. However, would I be back?! Maybe.... but there are many other choices in this plaza..."}
{"text":"My winter night and cold and flu craving! I got introduced to this place by a friend and now it's 1 of my fav cheap eat places. This place is great for take out, as dine in isn't really atmospheric. Takeout is packaged well and there's never been any leakage in taking the soup home. My typical order is the noodle soup (egg noodles for me) with shrimp wonton and beef brisket. The brisket is crazy tender and melt in your mouth, although, depending on the piece you get that day it can be a little fatty. The shrimp wontons are bigger then the spoon and when you bite into the wonton you can see large pieces of shrimp. The egg noodles are my favourite, nice and chewy. I haven't really ventured past the soup, so I can't comment on any other dishes."}
{"text":"What's better than wonton noodle soup on a cold day? Nothing!  Ordered the 3 items noodle soup (chose shrimp wonton, beef brisket, and their handmade fish balls) preferred the first 2 better. The brisket was tender, had a yummy mix of tendon, fatty and lean parts. The wontons were HUGE and had at least 3 whole shrimps in them! So good, definitely my favourite. The fish balls was average. It had remnants of something? Maybe it's suppose to be like that? Not my preferred texture of fish balls.  Also got the lo mein with beef brisket. It's dried noodle on a small bed of lettuce and comes with a bowl of soup. Was I suppose to put the noodle in the soup? Dunno but did it anyways and ended up with 2 bowls of noodle soup. This gooey sauce covered the lo mein and made the texture a little odd. I preferred the original noodle soup better, the soup was more flavourful.   Service was super speedy. Got my food 2 mins after I ordered. In, eat, out."}
{"text":"The one one was located at New Kennedy Square but they closed for awhile and I didn't know what happened to it because sometimes I do crave for wonton noodles and there really isn't that many options in the area...  So after reading Jennifer K. review (Thanks Jen!!) I recently found out that they relocated to across the street from New Kennedy Square..The South Unionville Mall with the T&T and etc..  I found that after a year (I think!) that they closed and reopening here, the quality has somewhat enhanced. The restaurant is definnetely smaller than the old location..so expect to wait for a table during weekend...  This is a place for quick eat, not for you to spend a long time deciding what to eat and etc...The wonton pieces are big and they don't cheat your dollar because it actually has shrimp and pork inside it..not like places where it claims to be shrimp wonton and you figured afterwards your order comes, it's not as claimed...  It's clean yet not spacious...$5.50 for a bowl of noodles, beef brisket is ok...ordered 1 wonton and dumpling noodle, beef brisket and a plate of veggies..all ended up being $20 (tax and tip in)  All in all, a place I would come when I'm craving for wonton noodles!!"}
{"text":"Went there to try for the first time based on the reviews. Price have gone up by $0.50 for a bowl of wonton noodle. For a place that specializes in wonton and shrimp dumplings, they really need to be perfect in their wonton preparation but they don't. There was a big piece of shrimp shell inside the wonton that almost cut my tongue to bleed. Ouch!!!  The noodle portion is smaller than other comparable noodle places that charge more or less the same price. For a lady, the size should be OK. For a guy, you may need to take up their $2 extra noodle option so in the end it is not really that cheap. No lettuces underneath the noodles either that are common in other places when you order a bowl of wonton and shrimp dumpling noodles."}
{"text":"I like that there are more options than Jim chai kee like brisket and fried fish skin, but the downside is that prices are higher here.  If you're just looking to get a bowl of wonton noodles I'd stick with Jim cha kee, but if you want a variety of sides I would recommend won ton chai."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices for the amount of food they give you. Soup base is a bit on the salty side in my opinion. Too much MSG.   Noodles are crunchy and tender. Fish balls were large and tasted really good. Wonton were packed with shrimp.   This restaurant is a good place to come to in Markham if you want a simple bowl of noodles and shrimp balls or wontons."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good wonton noodle place for its price. I had the Shrimp Wonton Noodle in Soup and the sizing was decent. For 6 dollars, it had 4 shrimp wontons and a decent amount of noodles. The wontons were pretty big and had a lot of shrimp inside. Also be advised that during peak hiurs you may have to share tables with others."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant I've visited that puts so much emphasis on the common wonton, and my hometown is full of Cantonese restaurants. It's telling when they offer bowls that either come with or without the noodles. Having the round shrimp dumplings with the egg noodles is definitely more traditional, but maybe you want to bypass the carbs sometimes and eat more of their signature dish. The wontons are much bigger than at most places, and you can tell they put in a lot of effort. The dumpling skin is nice and thin, while the ball of shrimp inside is big, fresh, and meaty. A bowl of wontons only can definitely fill you up.  The restaurant is cutely decorated and their menus have one of those traditional paragraph explanations of the history and stories surrounding wontons (if you can read it). Pretty cool to elevate this to the level of like Lanzhou ramen. In addition, I also really liked their beef brisket, which was tender and savory. I'm sure everything else is good too."}
{"text":"How could I not come in this place every time I came nearby? Highly recommend the deep fried fish skin. It's so crispy and tasty, better than that I had before.The noodle soup is clean. Won tons are big!!! Very quick service and very good price. LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Whenever you need a quick and simple bite, this should be your place. Every time I come here, I always get the lo mien with fish balls + shrimp wontons for $9, add a bit of their hot chill and it's perfection."}
{"text":"There's been a few of these popping up all over town as of late. When they first set up shop out west (Sauga) it was my go-to place for a quick cheap eat. I am not going to say their food will knock your socks off but if you're looking for a decent quality, cheap and filling bowl of soup during the dead of winter then this is worth a try.  For some strange reason this location isn't quite as good as the one out west. There's something lacking about the flavours here or maybe it's just my emotional attachment out west. LOL  You probably won't find anything in this area that's more convenient for wonton noodles but if you dare to venture out west a little on hwy 7 then I would definitely head over to Jim Chai Kee instead. The latter is heads and shoulders above this place in every category except maybe variety. Though don't expect a textbook like menu of endless items."}
{"text":"It's all about comparisons. In a city with so many micro genres of food like wonton noodle, you can't help but compare and rank. At least, for wonton noodles, there are a limited number of comparisons that can be made to Wonton Hut and Jim Chai Kee.  Noodles: On the hard side and could be better. Wonton: On the larger side and full of shrimp. Soup: Not the most flavorful and salty (which hints to MSG) Boiled Vegetables: very small portion but it's $3.50 so it's acceptable. Service: Expressionless and borderline rude. Enough to not want to ask for extra napkins.  If other places are closed and you have a craving then this place is acceptable but really nothing amazing."}
{"text":"The prototype quick Chinese lunch!  Wonton Chai Noodle is very much similar to Jim Chai Kee in Richmond Hill, but the place is a lot cleaner on the inside. (Parking is crap though so watch your cars people). Located on a strip plaza close to the Oriental Centre, this small little place has a small menu to match. They serve noodles in soup with giant balls of shrimp wonton and some other fixins as well.  I ordered my bowl with Shrimp Wontons, Beef Brisket, and rice noodles. The bowl is BIG and the shrimp wontons swimming around the aromatic broth are just as large. Golf-ball sized shrimp wontons were full of flavor and I love the sesame oil aroma that comes flowing out of it. The beef brisket was a bit lackluster as the portion size for that wasn't at all great, but the shrimp wontons do you pretty good. (There are about 4-5 pieces that come to a bowl).   The egg noodle is typically my choice because I love the thin texture that inherits a slight undertone of the broth. Most of my friends prefer the rice noodle which soaks up broth much more readily and is thicker in texture, so I decided to give it a try this time around.   If you decide to come here for lunch, know that it's quick, easy, cheap and not at all too packed as there are a number of tables for which to sit at. This place is also a cash-only establishment so hit up the ATM beforehand if you need to, as I didn't see one around the vicinity."}
{"text":"BEST wontons in town!  I usually get the wonton in hor fun (thick rice noodle).  Their chili oil is not that spicy, but has a great flavour.  I sometimes even buy wontons separately to cook them at home because they're so well done. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"Quality and very inexpensive. From $4-$8 not including tax you'd expect subpar noodle soup but everything about the noodle soup and side veggies are top quality.  The noodles are al dente, the soup is pungent and the dumplings are plump, firm and hardy. The veggies are a great side dish to add your greens and some contrasting crunch to your noodle bowl.  Wonton Chai is now my go-to place for wonton and dumpling noodles."}
{"text":"It's so yummy. Nice big flavourful won tons with giant shrimp. My family love the soup flavour and the place is quite comfortable for seating and clean. The decor is modern and I have already frequented a few times over the last month since I discovered it."}
{"text":"If you want wonton noodles soup HK style, this is the right place. The food was good, service was ok and the food came out fast.."}
{"text":"I have to rate 4 star for he beef brisket noodle. One of the best I've had for a long time. Service is very goo. Just there plate portion is small."}
{"text":"Yummy. Speedy. And cheap. Need I say more?    Get the combo noodles so you can try the wonton beef and fish"}
{"text":"Very spacious, lots of seating and clean. Service is fast, talking about minutes. Wontons are huge, lots of shrimp inside. The beef brisket is tender, not very flavourful. The dace fish ball isn't fishy or raw tasting. Even though this place is called wonton chai, my favourite item here is actually their dumplings. If I got any one item, it would be their dumplings. Its addicting.   I used to go to the wonton place at the Jubilee Plaza on highway 7 and Leslie but that place is always so packed! This is now my staple go to quick noodle dumpling stop. The wontons are comparable and there are more selections here. There is also take out here.  For those who complain about the seating, the tasteless soup broth, the tea here, it's a hk style cafe. You have the option to not share a table. If you want to talk to your family in peace, then don't share a table, or don't go to a Chinese restaurant LOL.  It's not meant to be anything more than that. Also, the wonton broth is not tasteless because it's meant to be lightly seasoned, complimenting the taste of the fish and shrimp. It's not ramen for goodness sakes. And all hk cafe serve that \"water down tea\".  If you want steeped tea or rich soup broth, you can go to a Japanese ramen restaurant, not a place that serves wonton soup.   I am in no way affiliated with anyone from this restaurant but it kills me to see anyone go to a restaurant and give it poor ratings with unfair judging criteria."}
{"text":"This place is great! Clean and good seating.  The noodles are springy, the broth is clear and tasty (actually drinkable!), and the wontons are huge! (1 = 2 regular size) Really has that Hong Kong feel.  Chili oil is good as well.  Portions are good and you can opt to add extra noodles."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times for two reasons: price and convenience. A bowl of wonton or beef brisket is very reasonably priced ($5-$8) and is served usually within 5-10 minutes of being seated. I can always appreciate the speed of delivery, particularly when I need food to fuel the engine.  The wontons are large in size with generous fillings. Flavour of the wontons are perfect - not overwhelming or underwhelming. The noodles on the other hand are hard to chew when you first get the bowl of wonton, but becomes softer as it marinates in the soup.   One point has been taken off because I find that a bowl of wonton noodles is not very filling. I always find myself extremely hungry later that night or in the morning the next day. This might just be my problem though."}
{"text":"This is the go to place for fast, great noodle soups. I usually get the beef brisket ho fun noodle soup and it always tastes so good. The dishes come out super quickly (literally under 10 minutes for everything) and always taste so good. I dump a lot of their homemade chili oil on that makes the soups taste even better!  The wontons are also so so big. They are double the size of my eyes! The beef briskets are always so good; they incorporate briskets that have fat (which I loveeeee) and some that don't.  I also get the Chinese vegetable in oyster sauce, which is done in like 3 minutes. It's so so delicious!! Totally recommend."}
{"text":"I did take out and I thought it was a pretty great value, I really enjoyed the beef brisket. The quantity was plentiful and the beef I got was really juicy and good (ie not too chewy)... Will definitely come back and try the other menu items"}
{"text":"Although they only do a few things at this restaurant, they do it well. Seating is not that comfortable, but given that it's pretty much designed to be an eat and get the heck out kind of place, that's to be expected. Wontons are nice and fat, beef is very well done, dace fish balls large....  Consistency could be improved, but overall a great fast eat!"}
{"text":"With midterm season arriving, I seldom venture around Mississauga in search for food greatness. As a university student, hours of studying are strenuous to the mind and body. Quick to prepare and low cost takeout food is needed to ease the stress. However, my desire for hunger satisfaction and the Chinese New Year celebrations would not refuse. Enter Wonton Chai Noodle, located yonder in the midst of Chinese restaurants.   Arriving at the restaurant, I ordered takeout which consisted of: Beef Ho-Fun Soup and Wonton Noodle Soup. The service was average throughout my wait. Exiting the restaurant, I ventured towards home to eat.  Arriving at home, I unpackaged my takeout boxes and poured the noodles/soup into a bowl (see pictures for food). My hunger instincts led me to try the Beef Ho-Fun Soup first and the Wonton Noodle Soup second.  The Beef Ho-Fun Noodles tasted amazing. The noodles maintained perfect texture and absorbed the flavors of the soup. The soup, per se (in itself), was brewed amazingly, with perfect seasoning.    Finishing my Beef Ho-Fun Noodles, I began eating my second dish. The Wonton Noodle Soup was delicious. The wontons tasted fresh and consistent in texture throughout each bite. The noodles were also amazing, with a soft texture.   In my venture towards food greatness, Wonton Chai Noodle satisfied my hunger. Both noodle soups tasted amazing and fresh. Whether you are a YorkU, UTM or any university student, delicious hot noodle soup cannot be denied. If hunger strikes while studying, sally forth towards Wonton Chai Noodle.  P.S If you stumble upon a grammatical error or an awkward sentence, fear not! Message Rao, and all shall be fixed. I greatly appreciate it."}
{"text":"I've probably been here a couple dozen times and every time I leave the establishment I am a satisfied customer. The wonton noodle at Wonton Chai is one of the best in the GTA and definitely the best in all of Markham. If you are looking for a quick, cheap and filling meal, Wonton Chai can help you out!  Food 4.5/5 - their wontons, fish paste, dumplings and beef brisket are all great. Their noodles are always fresh, whether it be their wonton noodle or their rice noodle. To be honest I feel they have watered down their soup base over the last couple years but nonetheless it is still pretty good.  Service 5/5 - service is very basic, like in most HK-run establishments but it gets the job done and it is very quick. No complaints  Price 5/5 - Price is really cheap for what you're getting, I believe its $6 for a bowl of noodles. thats roughly the same price as a Big Mac! It's definitely worth the money and probably the best bang for your buck in the area."}
{"text":"Shrimp wonton were good quality, large and 'crispy', but too salty for my taste. Beef brisket was good. Noodles were good. Soup was piping hot. Even their free tea tasted ok. Overall very good food, just too much salt and MSG. If only they can get rid of those fruit flies."}
{"text":"Really great prices for pretty good food. Wasn't blown away by the chilli oil like everyone else seems to be, but the beef brisket is phenomenal and the dumplings and wontons are tasty. The noodles left much to be desired, to be honest, and so did the service. However, the four of us went here for breakfast and found that splitting two bowls left us satiated--the perfect amount!   Two bowls of lo mien (flat rice noodles, wontons, dumplings, and beef brisket), with tip, cost us twenty dollars! A steal!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, quick service and shrimp dumplings which are tasty and delicious, with little filler. As the colder weather rolls around, if you are looking for a cheap and cheerful options for noodles and dumplings, I would recommend Wonton Chai. Two people can eat for less than $20. Their egg noodles/rice noodles come out al dente, their broth is delicious and there are many toppings to choose from (beef brisket, dace fish balls and shrimp dumplings are my favourite!) . You can also get a side of vegetables for around $5 which also a steal. We even buy their chilli oil and keep a jar at home - it's delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is good, but every time I come they are close. I'm usually off on Wednesdays and they are close and when I get off work on other days they are closed because they changed their closing time to 6pm now. I don't know how I am going to eat at this restaurant anymore? so only 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Very busy as always. Had to share a table with another family.   The shrimp wonton was good size and good taste. The soup had a good typical asian taste. The wonton contains pork in it so it's not pure shrimp.   Dumpling and noodle were good too. Meet that comes with it was very tender"}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST wonton soup in the world! The broth has a special flavor, noodles are freshly made, and the wontons are superb.  Would recommend you also try the vegetable...dip in a little hoisin...yum."}
{"text":"This is basically the Chinese fast food at it's quickest. Not a place to linger over a meal, but a quick filling bite before you run off to your busy day. This place specializes in the different variations of noodles with shrimp wontons or beef brisket. Nothing fancy but it's cheap and cheerful and really really fast. Came on a Saturday for an early lunch, and was able to grab a table right away. Tea comes in a Styrofoam cup and there is a self serve station in the corner for refills. You place your order with the waitress and she literally turns around in 2 minutes with your order piping hot and ready to eat.   I had the 'water dumplings' with noodles in soup. The noodles were good, crisp and without the dreaded vinegar water taste. Thumbs up for the noodles. The water dumplings were HUGE.  The three of them lined up in my bowl could pretty much cover all the noodles underneath them. I've never see them that big before. The shrimp inside had that fresh texture which testifies to the quality of their ingredients. The dumplings were very delicious but I could taste the MSG the moment I bite into them. They were like little MSG bombs and I needed to drink alot of water afterwards. Great immediate taste, but with lingering consequences afterwards.... like most delicious chinese food unfortunately. Until I find a better wonton noodle soup, this will probably be my go-to place for now when the craving hits."}
{"text":"I love this spot for a quick lunch! It's a get in and out restaurant for a very convenient meal. There are a limited number of meat or protein options that you can match with either rice noodles, regular thin noodles or dry dipping noodles. My recommendations are the classic authentic wonton noodle soup or beef brisket rice noodle soup. Upon entering they will ask you if you want your own table or if you are okay with sharing tables. The servers are not the most friendly but they are very speedy and efficient. Highly recommend for noodle lovers!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on July 2 for the first time.  i was impressed for a wonton noodle house.  5 star for cleanliness, 5 star for service.  4 1/2 star for food as vegetable with oyster sauce can be cooked a little longer, same apply to beef brisket(both are a little bit tough, opinion from the whole family).  Overall, I will recommend this place to anyone who likes Chinese noodle soup.  If you plan going there on weekend, be there before before 11:30 a.m. or you have to wait in line as the place s not that big and busy. The photo shows the place was packed."}
{"text":"A very unsanitary place, crowded little area, food is mediocre. They take cash only. Rude in manner, automatically stereotyped me for not being able to speak Chinese when I spoke to them in English; I'm not from a Chinese decent."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick late lunch.  Smelled the wonton soup once stepped in. Noodle was chewy at first but became soggy after I finished my wontons.  Got to finish the noodle first and quickly before they get mushy!!  Wonton has lot of shrimps and yummmm.....but....started to get very thirsty after a bit........ bet it's the MSG : ("}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick, tasty and simple bowl of noodle soup, this is the place. Not to mention, its cheap cheap cheap.   Don't let the cheap fool you, everything is quite flavourful and simple. The way a good bowl of noodle soup should be.   They have a good sized simple menu with many choices. My wife had the Shrimp wonton and noodle soup, the shrimp wonton's were plentiful, surprising given the price of $5.   I had the beef brisket noodle soup. Very tasty and the beef was cooked perfectly. We also ordered a side dish for $2.50 of Chinese broccoli with Oyster sauce. Chrisp, clean and tasty and was a great addition to our meal.   It can get very busy here on weekends, so go early and don't plan on sitting around for a long time, order, eat and get out of there so you can share the goodness with the ones waiting.   I gave this a 4 because for the price and the way they cook it with so much flavour its a great balance."}
{"text":"I ordered a wonton soup noodle for lunch ($5.50).  The wontons were fresh and with good shrimps, yet I am used to bigger wontons.  The noodle portion was barely enough for me.  It might be too small for a man of average appetite.   For this portion, I wish it were cheaper."}
{"text":"I love the won ton noodle soup here. For $6 you get 4 huge won tons and some delicious egg noodles. This location is better than the other one on Kennedy as well as I noticed the won tons here are noticeably larger. The chilli oil here is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Food was tasty. Tea and water were \"serve yourself \". Wasn't sure about how the food was ordered as the menu set up was new to me and the dishes seemed to revolve around soup and noodles with something. Best to take along an Asian friend to figure it all out."}
{"text":"For the price you pay and the food you get, this serves to be a simple lunch/dinner place to go to if you can't figure out what to eat! Wonton noodle soup or the beef noodle soup are the safe choices (then again, they are limited in the selection anyways) but cost effective for sure.  So, if you're out of ideas but want something relatively cost friendly and soup noodle - try this place out!"}
{"text":"Omg where else can you find lunch for $6? Love the  wonton here, when you bite into them you get a mouthful of shrimp! They don't overcook the shrimp either so it's cooked perfectly well! I also tried beef brisket, this is so soft and tender! I only wish there were more pieces. I like using the chilli oil but it's on the hot and spicy side. Would definitely come back for the great value!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend introduced me to wonton chai when we first started dating and from then it's been my go to when I'm craving good wonton noodles. The store is in the plaza right on the northwest corner of Brimley and Sheppard.  Service is quick and efficient without being unfriendly and expect to get your food a few minutes after ordering. The menu is limited but given that their specialty is noodles I consider it a good thing. Everything is under $7 which is pretty great.  I usually get the shrimp wonton with noodles in soup. The soup is flavorful and salty without being overly so, and the noodles have a great texture - springy without being too raw or too mushy. The shrimp wontons are great - they give you five decently sized ones and there's lots of shrimp inside. Solid pieces so you know what you're getting is real shrimp.  There is a decent amount of seating and it doesn't feel sketchy at all. Simple and homey.  Overall a great option if you're looking for something light and comforting."}
{"text":"Nothing really noteworthy here. Good place for a quick and cheap meal, especially if you want a wonton noodle fix. Wontons are a good size compared with other places and good amount of shrimp inside the wontons. Noodle portions are a bit small but you can ask for extra noodles."}
{"text":"Quick and good food at low prices.  I was literally in and out within 15 minutes.  Got the noodles with shreaded pork and a side of 3 wontons for $7.90 taxes in. The wontons are as good as it gets and they are super huge. The noodles was a bit small for me. I should have got the extra noodle option for $2.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Was on my lunch break and really wanted to drink noodle soup because of the cold weather lately.    When i walked in i noticed how cheap everything on the menu was. Everything is literally under $10. I ended up getting the shrimp wonton noodle soup which was $5. I got my food right away, no long wait at all. The amount of soup and noodles was quite alot for the price you're paying for. The wontons were big packed with lots of shrimp, the soup with green onions just how I like it. The staff werent rude just a bit dry but who cares when your paying $5 for a tasty noodle soup. I think that outweighs everything. I definately found a new wonton noodle place. Just in case you were wondering they only take CASH."}
{"text":"Simply great wonton noodles, fast service and a peaceful environment to enjoy the classic dish!"}
{"text":"please note: cash only!  modestly-decorated dark-ish space located in a popular mississauga strip mall.  cute pictures of their various dishes on their walls.  popped in at around 3:30 on a thursday afternoon and it was rather empty except for myself and a few other customers.  i decided to try their famed brisket and wonton soup, and disappointment was nowhere to be found.  tasty broth (not sure what the ingredients are), albeit on the salty side.  chunks of brisket and massive shrimp wontons, both which are packed with flavour.  excellent serving size, and absolutely unbeatable at $6.50  theoretical plus points for making wontons that stay intact even after you bite into them"}
{"text":"Traditional Cantonese Shrimp Wonton noodles at its best! Small menu but they make everything quite well. I still prefer the location at hwy 7 more but this is closer. Fast service, perfect for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I ordered Beef Brisket in noodle soup plus shrimp wonton. Beef brisket was tender and tasty but a bit fatty. Shrimp wontons were big (3-4 small shrimps inside). Soup was mild, but there was plenty of chilli in oil at the table. Extremely quick service. Menus are mounted (laminated?) onto the table LOL. I would go back."}
{"text":"Simple menu with a selection of noodles served with wontons, dumplings, brisket, and such. The wontons a big and generous in terms of shrimp inside. There isn't too much variety here but if you're looking for a solid bowl of noodles, Wonton Chai hits the mark in terms of price and taste. You can get a decent bowl of noodles for around $6. This place works well for takeout as well."}
{"text":"This is my usual goto place after a long shift at work. Whether I'm sitting down or taking out the service is always fast. My typical order is either a wonton shrimp noodle soup or beef brisket noodle soup. The portions are generous and the wontons are large and flavourful. The beef brisket is tender and cooked just right. The place is usually packed during peak times so you might have to share a table with other patrons. For a tasty bowl of noodle soup at a reasonable price, you can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Solid bowl of noodles every time. Definitely comfort food on a cold day!  For the price, no complaints! Around $6 gets you a good size bowl of noodles plus your choice of protein (wontons, beef, etc.). The wontons here are huuuge shrimp-filled dumplings. Make sure to dip it in vinegar and their homemade chili oil - best combo ever."}
{"text":"This is a popular place for lunch on both weekdays and weekends. Even though there may be a line, the turnover of tables is fast! This is due to their fast service in which we were able to get our food within 5 minutes after ordering.   I love their noodle soup, usually getting the two topping (wonton and beef) noodles at $6.50. You can choose from a variety of noodles: egg noodles, rice noodles and vermicelli. With wontons, I always get the egg noodles! It came with 3 wontons and several pieces of beef. Their shrimp wontons were big, and the shrimp was chewy indicating that its fresh. The beef came a bit raw but cooked well in the hot soup.   One topping noodles are priced at $6.00, making Wonton Chai a very affordable and quick meal! All in all, would I come back? Yes, I want to try their dace fish balls!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today with my boyfriend and as soon as we walked in, we were greeted and seated right away.  As we looked through the menu, our server waited patiently close by.  When we were ready, she came over immediately and took our order.  We both ordered the wonton noodles and a side dish of Chinese greens with oyster sauce and... Wow!  Our order came out in less than one minute!  The greens were what you'd typically expect - Nothing exciting but still good.  Each bowl of wonton noodles came with 4 big wonton dumplings and a little bit of green onions in the soup.  My boyfriend unfortunately bit into a piece of shrimp tail that was stuck in one of the dumplings.  This could have been dangerous as he usually swallows the whole dumpling in one big gulp!  LOL...  I noticed that they serve the noodles in plastic bowls.  Although they also use plastic plates and chopsticks like many Chinese restaurants, I would have preferred that they used something \"longer-lasting\" and \"heat-resistant\" like ceramic or porcelain.  On the other hand, when we paid our bill at the cashier, I noticed they were selling their own hot chili oil in glass mason jars, which I think is good.  I usually see hot chili oil sold in plastic jars.  (Obviously, I'm not a big fan of plastics but that's just me!)  In summary, the service was friendly and the food came out super fast!  We both thought the wonton noodles were very satisfying.  Can't wait to come back again next time."}
{"text":"Wontons the size of a large golf ball or a small orange. Dumplings the size of a Twinkie. Eat them whole, or nibble your way through the glorious fleshy bags of goodness.  Wonton Chai is a quick meal that leaves you still slightly hungry, but not unsatisfied.  Parking is confusing & difficult as jump starting your car.  4/5 good for a snack. Will come back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times since it opened in this neighbourhood. The taste is fair, not spectacular but it does the job. The low rating is mainly for its lack of cleanliness and poor service.   The folks working there act like they despise being there every moment and there's flies all the time. In fact, I was able to make friends with two different flies on my last visit, I named them Mojo and Jojo (see photos)"}
{"text":"Pros: Very good bowl of wonton noodles  Cons: Prices a bit higher than Jim Chai Kee  Let's get this out of the way, Jim Chai Kee is the my favourite place to get a bowl of wonton noodle.  That being said, this place is a very good second.  It's easily the best in Markham.    This Wonton Chai location is located in the Langham shopping plaza.  It's definitely smaller than the other Wonton Chai location in Scarborough.  During peak times, this place will get very busy so expect to wait for a table.  Turnover at these types of places are very fast so it won't be long.  It will be even quicker if you don't mind sharing a large table with other patrons.  I would say 6 people if the maximum group size for a comfortable experience.  If you've been to one of these places, you know the wonton noodle is the feature dish.  There are other noodles like brisket, dace and beef as well, but you're most likely coming for the wontons.  This place doesn't disappoint with their rendition of it.  The wontons are large and full of shrimp.  Their a little saltier than Jim Chai Kee, but still very good. My GF ordered the wonton noodle and I got the same with brisket as well.  The brisket was a little tough, but overall it was enjoyable.    The prices here are higher here.  I think it's about a $1 difference per bowl over Jim Chai Kee.  It's not a complete deal breaker but it is something to note.  Service here is on par with most places of this nature.  Nothing of note to mention when it comes to that.  If you're in Markham, this is your go to place for wonton noodles. I have not found a better place.  Jim Chai Kee remains my favourite, but you can't go wrong here as well."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for wonton noodles in Mississauga- the wontons are huge and have a nice bouncy texture, the noodles are done nicely and everything I've ordered here is done well. The broth is flavorful but heavy on the MSG and the portions are generous. For a quick meal of wonton soup noodles, this is the place.  Service is fast and very no-frills. Naturally, cash-only."}
{"text":"Came here on Labour Day at noon and it was at capacity, but no long line ups.  The food and service here is on par with all the other locations, I ordered the wontons with rice noodles, veggies and deep fried fish skin. The wontons are huge and filled with shrimp! The food was great and the place was clean. I would note that the layout of this place is a little odd are there is a huge open space down the middle of the restaurant.. could have fit some more seating there?  There is ample parking and they are conveniently located off the 404 at Major Mac, great location!"}
{"text":"Food is cheap, prepared quickly, and delicious at this HK style noodle and wonton spot.   I had noodles with shredded pork ($6.50) and added three large shrimp wontons on the side (+$2.00). The egg noodles were topped with shredded pork and mushrooms, in a delicious sweet and slightly spicy tomato based sauce. The meal also comes with a side of vegetables and a bowl of soup.   I ordered take out and my food was ready within five minutes. Taxes are included in the menu price which is an added bonus. One thing to keep in mind is that this place accepts cash only."}
{"text":"I like this place for their variety. They have the standard wonton, fish balls, meat balls with the 3 types of noodles, dry or in soup. However, they also offer their delicious dumplings and beef brisket. I personally had better wontons in the GTA but this place is my default when my family and friends feel like having something soupy. Service is good for a Chinese run restaurant."}
{"text":"Fast service, like less than 5 minutes to get food after you order fast. Their wontons are absolutely huge! My favourite wonton noodles in the city, chewy but not raw. I would recommend this to everyone, the service is always nice but don't expect too much, it's basically a fast food place!"}
{"text":"Best place for wonton noodle, and I love their beef brisket, it goes well with rice noodle and vermicelli.  If you like the HK style type of noodle, this is the place to go.  I really should give them 5 stars, but that 1 star get taken away is they always close on Wednesday, I believe it's a family tradition or something, and co-incident, I always work from home on the Wednesday, so when I have the craving of a bowl of wonton noodle on a Wednesday, I am out of luck.  Anyways, I probably visit this place at least 4~5 times a month, and their service is always consistent."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, in my opinion, they have the best wontons!!  I've been here many times, the wontons are always good!!!!  Noodles are good, beef is good, fish skin is good!! Just all around great wonton noodle house!!  Totally recommend!! 5 stars every time!!  I would say tho, that Jim Chai Kee Wonton House has awesome wonton noodles for just $5 instead of $6.95 - which is a huge difference.. But wontons at Wonton Boy are a bit bigger and in my opinion taste better."}
{"text":"This is a small and cozy restaurant. It was not too busy and we easily got a table. My wife and I both ordered the shrimp wonton soup and it came quickly. The soup was of decent size and it tasted great. The price is also reasonable (12$ tax included for both of us). The only negative thing is that they were burning some incense sticks and it's not a smell I enjoy. Other than that, will certainly return."}
{"text":"Seriously the best wonton soup in the GTA. I've had wonton soup at over 15 restaurant in China Town on Spadina and noting comes close. The broth is amazing and always perfect, and the wontons are massive and super tasty."}
{"text":"Could be a bit more cheerful, but definitely a cheap and classic Canto comfort food!    There are 3 parts of the menu:  Apps/Dumplings in Soup, Noodles in Soup, & Lo Mein.  If you're a beginner, you just hafta concern yourself with the Noodles in Soup portion.  And for the noodles, you have your choice of 3 different types of noodles, egg (standard wonton noodles), rice (prob thinner haw fun), & vermicelli.  I ordered the 2 varieties, wontons + dumplings, with wonton noodles for $5.50.  Noodles themselves were thinner than the ones you buy at the Chinese grocery store and cooked al dente!  Wonton/dumplings were plump and juicy.  Dumpling ingredients were mushrooms, pork, & shrimp.  At ~$5 a bowl for your standard wonton noodle soup, it's great for a light meal, in-between meal, &/or snack.  Unlike dim sum, it won't make you fall asleep afterwards due to the MSG-overload...Zzzz...  Note:  CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for a quick bite.  This place will have you in and one in under twenty minutes if you are in a hurry. Best wonton noodles in the city! Parking may be a challenge though as the plaza is always busy. There is two levels of underground parking though. Quality and portions of noodles are always consistent!  **Note that they are closed on Wednesday!"}
{"text":"This was a last minute decision to eat here, and I definitely do not regret it!   I had ordered the soup with two items option, the items being shrimp wonton and fish balls. My friend ordered the same thing, but dumplings rather than wonton. What immediately struck us by surprise was the house-made fish balls. We were both expecting generic storebought fishballs. The fishballs tasted great and there was more than enough noodles in the bowl to fill us up. The fish balls had a soft chewy texture that's perfect for soaking up all the hot soup. Each bite of the meatballs, you have scallions which were generously packed in. I can't stress how great these were.  With that said, both weren't expecting the dumpling and wonton to be essentially the same thing.   In the end, service was extremely quick and we left satisfied. The only real downside is that this place is cash only."}
{"text":"The food is good (excellent for Mississauga's standard), and the servers are nice. A new server cleaned a table so well and fast that she took even the cups away. The owner actually tried to teach her that is not polite. They tried to train her how to be polite to the customers and make them feel at home and never rush the customers. Now, THAT is good service."}
{"text":"Really some of the best wonton noodle soup I've had. The wontons are so fresh, yummy and filling! The broth is pretty much perfect, it makes for exceptional comfort food.   The service is efficient and quick, our dishes came out probably within 5 minutes of ordering. I've heard the place often closes early because they sell out of wontons!   Definitely try this place. Also bonus that it's right next to BR so you can get a filling meal and dessert for under $10 hehe. Can't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"in terms of food, not bad. tons of MSG though, you can taste it straight away.  service is terrible. food took forever to come when there was only 1 other table (who came after us, mind you), and they got all their dishes before we even had a single thing on our table. and no, they did not order something that was quicker to come than we did. we ordered pretty much the exact same thing if i remember correctly (two bowls of the wonton noodle). they got theirs like 5-7 minutes before we did despite us coming in first. its possible that the other table were regulars, and thats why, but if there are only two tables in the restaurant, don't make it so obvious by serving them first. this was my first time trying out this restaurant, and it certainly left a bad impression because of the terrible service. makes you not want to return. tip to the restaurant: if you know there are newcomers to try your restaurant, you should make the experience top-knotch so that they will return as new regulars. aside from the terrible favouritism, the food did take unusually long to come for a wonton place. all other wonton places come lightning fast. like a minute after you put in your order. our food came around 10 minutes after putting in the order despite the restaurant having only two tables at the time."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a quick and cheap meal! This place is great for soups and noodles. Service is extremely quick. Food comes out within 5 minutes of ordering. Food is delicious, love their beef brisket noodles and wontons. During peak hours, tables are shared with others.   P.S. Remeber to bring cash, this place is cash only!!!"}
{"text":"Wonton Chai offers a basic selection of noodles with wontons and a few other options. This is one of my favorite places for Wonton Noodle Soup! I previously went to Wonton Hut at Warden and Highway 7 and I prefer Wonton Chai over them.  The soup base is not very salty or loaded with MSG and the wontons have tons of flavor. The shrimp is fresh and the additional ingredients inside make them quite tasty. A bowl of noodle soup with 4 wontons will set you back $5.50 which is very reasonable. My only complaint is that the portions are a little small but you do have the option for adding more noodles.  The service is quick and the restaurant is pretty clean. You could be in and out of there in 15 minutes. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This location messed up on my bill for the 3rd time this past weekend. I don't know if it's intentional but I always order 2 toppings but gets charged for 3 and it's always the same mistake."}
{"text":"Just as good as the old location! Noodles are just right and toppings delicious.   Beef brisket was a bit on the fatty side but still nice and soft. Shrimp Wonton and dace fish balls both tasty and simple.   Ambiance is okay, very clean but zero music and a bit too quiet."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have not reviewed this place yet!! .. I was here like almost everyday and I'm definitely coming back to have this amazing food again soon.  This really isn't a fancy place at all, but the place it self is quick and simple yet I drool every time I drive by this place.   The thing is, a lot of the items on the menu are repetitive, but what do I mean by that, you ask? Example, they have beef brisket, and you can get that with noodles, or you can get that in a soup or even with soup and noodles, same with the wontons, with just the noodles or with the soup or soup/noodle and other meat and veggie options available as well.  This place is great for a quick in and out meal and oh did I mention the price point won't even dent your wallet. you can probably gather up the change in your car and eat a full meal here with a drink.  I Will be back to this place soon, and honestly I am looking so forward to it!"}
{"text":"Same as the other location I frequent it is amazing for what it is. I brought le boyfriend with me since this is the only location that is open today. I feel like my only complaint is - if he wanted to order 3 toppings he can not make two of them beef brisket. They have to be three DIFFERENT toppings. Let be real tho, can really complain about it because it's amazing for the price it is.   Service was quick, food was fantastic and I always recommend this chain to anyone who will listen!"}
{"text":"This is literally one of my favourite spots to have wonton noodle soup ! I love to come here by myself before I go to work because it quick and consistently delicious. The location is good with lots of parking. It is great because they only accept cash and literally ALL the banks are within the same plaza.  The staff is always serving you with a smile. Always on top of things and I literally never have to wait for anything. I always get the Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup with the egg noodle. I saw other reviews saying that the noodles are mushy etc.. HOWEVER they are not at all! Amazing texture and the wontons have full sized shrimps and it is jammed packed with flavour.  Thank you for the amazing client service and the consistently providing excellent food."}
{"text":"Very well priced for the portion served. And, it was served fast! It took less than 2 mins for them to bring our food. We were out of the door and paid in less than 30.  I am not a huge fan of wontons normally, but it was delicious! Will go back!"}
{"text":"Was looking for some Chinese comfort food in Sauga and Wonton Chai Noodle hit the spot, right on.  I'm from Scarborough and frequently visit Chinese places in Markham/Richmond Hill and since moving to Mississauga I have struggled to find the same quality, price point, and overall experience in any other Asian restaurants out west.  The restaurant decor is nothing special/spectacular but they're not trying to be anything pretentious and you're not going take your date here for your special anniversaries either.   Wonton Chai Noodle is the real deal with authentic handmade egg noodles and quality made dumplings and wontons.  The menu is on a small card with limited but specialty choices with varying portion sizes including an option for \"extra noodles\" for $2 :) (which was fantastic btw).  We'll be regulars to Wonton Chai Noodle from now on."}
{"text":"MSG. This is the second time I've been here and i thought I'd give it another try before leaving this review. But I've concluded after this visit that it's honestly filled with a lot of artificial flavouring. I was extremely thirsty after the meal. The first visit I had the wonton noodles and this time I had the beef brisket noodles. Both of which have left me extremely thirsty."}
{"text":"Wanton Chai Noodle is a typical HK style wanton noodle.  I really think the price is way too high for a dumpling noodle and Crispy Fish Skin at 14 Dollars.  I don't really like wanton, but i love dumpling very much. Wanton Chai offers dumpling only in the weekend.  Portion a little...Noodle three sips can finish.  The crispy was very good, I couldn't finish it on my own."}
{"text":"The craving of noodle soup fulfilled.  I've been to this restaurant before with my family where we always admire the simplicity of the menu. The main focus of the menu is the noodle soup style. You have a dozen options of how you take your noodle soup. The options include beef brisket, wonton, dumpling, and fish dace.   I had the break brisket and dumplings. It was quickly served with a soup base that was not too salty. The noodle option I chose was the ho fun. My favourite. The prices are reasonable and worth for the portion size you receive.   The restaurant was quick full with every table taken.   The kitchen is open concept where you can see the cooks prepare the food.   We also had boiled iceberg lettuce with oyster sauce. A dish that can't go wrong.   Overall, my dining experience was pleasant. No complaints.   Definitely a place to visit again for a good old craving of noodle soup."}
{"text":"Quick, delicious and massive wontons! I have been here on multiple occasions and it has always been so good! The portions are huge! I usually get a mix of wontons and fish balls and the portions are double the size compared to any other restaurant. My boyfriend wanted to get two orders of wontons and the waitress just laughed and said he didn't need it. So good and filling. Their food is also very reasonably priced. I was able to take my parents and grandparents here for lunch and treat them out without feeling like there was a big hole in my bank account after. Best dumplings in sauga for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing value! $5 for a big bowl of noodles (you can choose mein or flat rice noodles) and 5 GIANT wontons filled with shrimp. Their red vinegar is kind of weird though - I think they add a lot of sugar or something to it. It would've been better if it was straight up red vinegar."}
{"text":"Very simple and delicious shrimp wonton noodle soup. It's about $6-7 for a bowl and it's so good. Hot soup for one please.  Quick turnover so you're in and out in 20min. They serve the food asap. The shrimp wontons are MASSIVE.   Go and try it."}
{"text":"Delicious! Cheap! And generous on meat and dumplings! Good to have every typical cold day. I always love it when a restaurant exceeds my expectations!!"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5 This place is located on Kennedy Rd and Highway 7 in Langham Square (the plaza with T&T Supermarket).   [SERVICE] - 5/5 Our server was very nice and friendly. Our order arrived to our table very quickly as well.  [DÉCOR] - 3/5  Average. Clean and modern decor with posters for their Signature Dishes in Chinese (items are also on the English menu).   [QUALITY] - 4/5 Wontons were delicious and noodles were cooked perfectly. Such a simple and comforting meal.  [ORDER] - 4/5 - Shrimp Wonton Noodle In Soup - $6.00: texture of wontons were nice and bouncy, noodles were al dente, and soup did not taste too salty.   - Two Kinds of Toppings Noodle In Soup - $7.00: we chose the shrimp wonton and beef brisket. The wonton and noodles were the same as the one from the shrimp wonton noodle soup. The beef brisket was tender and cooked very well! Definitely worth the price.   [OVERALL] - 4/5 I think they perfected their signature shrimp wonton and noodles. The only that that would make this dish better would be some veggies to add a hint of freshness. Other than that, I would definitely recommend Wonton Chai for those who want a simple and delicious meal."}
{"text":"Wonton Chai is a no-frills place that offers a simple menu and barebones decor. The wontons noodles are cheap with large portions of wontons that are consistently decent in quality."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious soup. Super simple and served quickly. I got the 3 topping soup with egg noodles. I chose shrimp dumpling. Beef brisket and fish ball. Added a huge dose of chili oil and it was perfect!  My only negatives were that there are shared tables and the restaurant was super hot. Hot soup plus hot environment equals sweat ball."}
{"text":"Food- mmmmm if you're craving wontons I highly recommend this place. I ordered the shrimp wonton with egg noodles. Yum! Be careful with the chilli oil ... it's hotter than usual. I would come back and try the beef brisket with won tons. Mmm!   Service - mediocre. They asked us to share a table and it was very awkward. So we declined and waited for a private table of our own.   Parking - free parking outside   Overall, good experience. Good food. Would come back when I feel wontons!! Mmm."}
{"text":"The best wontons in Markham! If you're looking for fast and yummy then this is the place!  Came here half an hour before they closed and was able to eat, finish and leave in record speed!  That being said, service is extremely quick and workers are friendly as well!  Food wise, I love how large their wontons are and you just cannot go wrong with them!   The perfect place to go to for a quick and tasty meal!  Must try if u haven't already! :D"}
{"text":"I haven't been in Markham for a while so I haven't eaten decent Chinese noodle soups in a while.    I was actually pretty excited to eat some wonton noodles with dumplings but unfortunately all of their dumplings and wontons have pork in them.  I recently stopped eating pork and this was a bummer.  I still had my noodle carbs though!    I ordered the beef brisket noodle with soup on the side, fish skin, and their veggie greens with ho yau (hoi sin sauce).  The fish skin was okay, it was a little soggy from the moisture in the kitchen but still crispy.  The noodles were as good as I remembered and very al-dente so I got full quick but the quality of the beef brisket wan't the best.  The reason for 2 stars is: 1. I found a fly in my veggies. I didn't even try getting the waiter's attention. I wasn't going to argue with them on something they probably won't care about (mid-age Asian ladies trying to be efficient as possible, throwing food on the table) 2. They added a tip onto the bill and didn't mention it. They wrote it in Chinese so I wouldn't have even noticed (I don't read Chinese). Thank god my mom saw or I would've been tipping hard for less than average service and a damn fly.  I'll try Wonton Hut or Jim Chai Kee next time."}
{"text":"I gave around the same rating for my last experience.  Here are the reasons why:  Price (again): Other wonton restaurants charges you $5 for a bowl of wontons + noodles and maybe $6 for a bowl of beef brisket vs. here: $6 for a bowl of wonton & $8.50 for a bowl of beef brisket. As a student barely surviving on soy sauce and rice - I need these prices to be competitive.  However, this time I honestly disliked the food as well.  The soup was very bland although the wontons were decent.  I started feeling super sick shortly after I ate here and it was my only meal of the day.  Don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped by today because I've heard very good things about Wonton Chai Noodle. Their menu is very simple, but it is just the perfect amount of options. I had the beef brisket noodle in soup with rice noodles - it was really good! The beef was sooo tender omg, I wish I ordered extra beef brisket. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp wonton noodle in soup and was very satisfied with his order.  Definitely recommend & will definitely be back to try the shrimp wonton noodle next! I also love that it is super affordable, mine and my boyfriend's was only $6 each and we both were full after!   P.S. CASH only!!"}
{"text":"Shrimp wonton soup with beef brisket and egg noodles for brunch this morning was good and filling. The shrimp wonton was huge and much bigger than how it looked on the menu. Not the traditional dim sum menu, everything was mainly soups and wonton. Nothing fried on the menu, everything is all boiled so that might be good for some people."}
{"text":"Dace Fish ball & Beef Brisket rice noodles ($7.50) It's $6.50 for one topping with your noodles, and additional dollar if you want to add another topping. The bowl of noodles come with 3 pieces of dace fish balls, and 3 pieces of beef brisket. The dace fish balls were good, I think the beef brisket meat could have been more tender. One of the 3 pieces was the tendon, and the second piece was mostly the skin so I pretty much only got one piece of true beef meat. I chose rice noodles which was a bad choice - the rice noodles were very disappointing; too thick and not too soft. My bowl actually didn't have too much noodles, where as my coworker's had a lot more - inconsistent. Personally, I think the poor rice noodles ruined my experience of noodles here.  I think Wonton Hut does a better job.  Also ordered the crispy fried fish skin ($6) on the side. It was good, crunchy like chips but lacked a bit of flavor. I thought it would be more salty."}
{"text":"Won't Chai Noodle is a great place if you are in a rush on a weekday. The servers take your order really quickly and the food comes in less than 10 Minutes. I came here on a weekday so it was not that busy. However on weekends the place is usually packed, but it is worth the wait if you decide to come here. The shrimp wontons are really big and flavourful which I like. The broth complements the wontons very nicely as it is very flavourful. If you love eating noodles I suggest to get the noodles as well. They are handmade and made fresh daily. A good tip is to add the chili oil to the broth if you want a little kick to the soup. Don't add too much though, it is really spicy."}
{"text":"This was the second HK Style noodle shop we visited on our trip to Toronto. It is very similar to Jim Chai Kee but noticeably different. The menu has more items and the place is cleaner. The noodles do not have a strong alkaline taste but the giant shrimp wontons are better than Jim Chai Kee. The house chili sauce is also really good. I didn't add any to my bowl, but I took a couple spoonfuls from my wife after she urged me to try it a couple times. I personally like the alkaline taste so I would choose Jim Chai Kee over this place but only because of the alkaline taste. If you don't have a preference for the alkaline taste, this would be a better bet because the wontons are HUGE and the bowl is bigger."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go. Simple menu so simple and quick service I LOVE IT ! The owner already knows my families order before we even sit down haha"}
{"text":"Great won ton with noodles and cheap. Very tasty broth. Very fast service, ordered and got our order in under 5 minutes. $25 for 3 of us including 1 large order and a small dish of vegetables. Wouldn't recommend the Beef brisket, very fatty and not much meat."}
{"text":"Quick, clean, yummy!  - wontons are huge and mostly shrimp which I love. the chili oil is bang on and the menu is super cheap . I love the $6 wonton soup with steamed Veggies on the side. So glad I found this place ! Would definitely recommend ."}
{"text":"Good: 1. Beef brisket - Super flavourful, tender, darkened pieces of meat.  Some of the best I've tasted. 2. Chili oil - Nice flavour, more heat than most other places.  It really adds to the soup. 3. Price - Affordable.  Bad: 1. Rice noodles - Too choppy so not really slurpable and more difficult to eat.  Worth it? Definitely! A nice bowl of noodles with 1 topping for $6 is great.  Veggies only $3.50.  A top pick for wonton noodle cravings."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Wonton Chai Noodle!  I entered to a fully occupied restaurant, and so was directed to a table with another two people occupying it. I asked if it was possible that we could get a private table, which was obliged but with a 5-10 minute wait.  The menu is simple and direct. My intention for coming here was for the toppings (wontons, dumplings, dace fish balls). So I ordered one serving of the wontons in broth and another of fish balls in broth (no noodles). My brother, being vegetarian didn't have a lot of options unfortunately, so he got the plain noodle soup (although we were pretty sure the broth was not vegetarian, but he isn't too picky).  The food literally arrived within one minute! Usually I would never trust a restaurant that serves food that quick, but here, they have an open kitchen where you can see them boiling fresh wontons right then and there, so I know that I can trust them. The broth was piping hot and delicious...but loaded with salt! The fish balls (5 in one serving) were gigantic ! But the highlight of them all were the wontons. 5 gigantic wontons were served and were incredibly flavourful. I devoured both the bowls and was stuffed. My brother said the enjoyed the noodles, but I don't think he was \"wowed\" by them.  I will surely be going back and this time trying the dumplings. I do regret that I chose to try this place out when winter has come to an end. This meal would be ideal during the cold winter months. My only complaint was that, since they only take cash, I feel that they should at least have an ATM machine. Nevertheless, the price makes up for it (around $6.50 per bowl)!"}
{"text":"Wonton Chai Noodle is runned by the same family that runs Jim Chai Kee up in Richmond Hill.  The set up is really similar to Jim Chai Kee that only offers 3 choices Wonton, Beef and Fish Balls with either in noodle soup, in soup or noodles with oyster sauce.  They do have the spicy meat sauce with noodle or the beef brisket with noodles.  They suppose to have the same secret recipe as the other locations.  You have to get your own tea and if busy you might have to share tables with strangers.  I found this location, the portion is a little smaller. However, the restaurant itself is cleaner since this is relatively new compare to the Richmond Hill location.  The service is very fast and friendly. Good place to go when you in a rush.  They closes early though, 7:30 PM!  CASH only"}
{"text":"3.5 Star  Wonton Chai newest location is located in the same Mall complex as T&T Unionville.  If you have been to the other locations, you know the menu is really simple: wonton, beef, beef brisket, fish balls with soup noodles or lo mein (egg noodle with oyster sauce).   What makes this location stands out because it is a full service restaurant. You don't need to pour your own tea and waitress will give you your bill and change instead of you paying upfront.  We have a soup noodle and lo mein and the quailty is as good as their location in Scarborough. I love their shrimp dumplings  ?? here!  Cash Only!   Park underground is the way to go and you can even do some grocery shopping too!"}
{"text":"Eating Wonton Noodle Soup gives me a certain kind of comfort!   Hot soup, Big shrimp wonton, Chili oil makes the meal complete.  Wonton and Fish Ball Noodle ($5.50) really hit the spot. But for some, the portion might be consider as a snack.  Service here is fast and simple. Order, Eat and Pay!"}
{"text":"Wonton Chai Noodle newest Upper Markham location.  I frequent the other locations in Scarborough and Kennedy/7 but I now prefer this newest location.  Menu is identical with other locations so there is no surprise with the quality of food.  My usual Wonton Beef Noodle ($6.50) and Vegetable ($3.50) were both tasty!  The extra star is because there is ample parking for this location."}
{"text":"Whoot! A new restaurant for me to go to in my neck of town!  Very tasty and reasonably priced noodle restaurant. I had the beef brisket and Sui Kow (a larger version of the wonton) with dry loh mein noodles. It came with a bowl of soup garnished with lots of spring onions. Just the way I like it! Price is $6.50  The only drawback is I may get sick of the lack of variety. You have a choice of soup or dry noodles with one of half dozen different toppings and that's it.."}
{"text":"This is definitely a bit of a hidden gem here in Scarborough! It's located in this shoddy looking strip plaza, but don't be fooled, because when you go in the place is surprisingly spacious. When I went on a Sunday for lunch with my parents, every single table was full, but customers tend to come in and out pretty quickly so we didn't have to wait very long. Their menu is simple, and if anything I would complain that the selection is kind of lacking... in terms of noodles, they really only have three toppings you can get in your noodles: shrimp wonton, beef brisket, and dace fish ball, which is less so than other places. But prices really can't be beat! It's only $6 for a bowl of noodles if you get one or two toppings, and as other reviewers have noted, the shrimp wontons are soooo big.  Service: Attentive, but if anything maybe too attentive? It was like once we sat down at the table, the waitress was by our side, expectantly waiting for us to order... and we hadn't even really looked at the menu yet. We were talking amongst ourselves, and she kept interjecting to clarify things, which I guess was okay, but then she just kept lurking around, and it made me feel a bit uncomfortable and like we were being pressured to order quickly. I do realize that's just the way they do things though, everything was so quick, quick, quick, and rapid. Our food came out probably less than 5 minutes after we placed our order, and we were sitting right by the kitchen, so we could see them just rapidly filling bowl after bowl with noodles and soup.   Food: Delicious! For some reason my mother found the broth to be salty, but conversely, I thought it was really light in flavour and if anything even too light. But they give you lots of condiments (i.e. hot sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce) that you can add yourself. And again, you definitely get a decent amount of food for your money. I think at first I found my noodles to be a little bit too hard/undercooked, (probably because they were prepared so quickly) but I just soaked them a little longer in my soup and then they were okay.  Overall: Definitely can't beat the price, and great if you just want to grab a (super) quick, no frills meal. It's kind of cafeteria-style in the sense that you can go and grab your own water/tea (free of charge) at this little kitchenette thing they have, and then you pay at the counter when you are done your meal. But you know what, it's efficient, and gets the job done, so no complaints from me!"}
{"text":"For an Asian restaurant standard, the service could have been better. I'm saying this because they don't communicate whatsoever, almost like they don't know English. They should really put up a poster saying \"cash only\" for convenience so it would be less hectic about going to the ATM.  I personally like the toppings and the flavor of the soup, but the noodles are not my favorite. The portion and the price is just perfect for lunch so I was satisfied enough."}
{"text":"This might be their off day.  My expectation wasn't met.  The broth was diluted.  I kept pouring red vinegar in.  The wontons were good and big.  Mom said her dace fish balls were soft to the bite.  They don't have the firmer texture like the fish balls at Wonton Hut and Jim Chai Kee.  The services is fast.  The store is pretty and spacious.  Ample parking."}
{"text":"This was a good place to have Wonton, but they have close up the shop already. Too bad is hades to find a place like this again."}
{"text":"Good portions, VERY fast service and decent food. I would avoid the beef slices and fish balls though unless that's your thing. The dumplings and wontons are better."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Don't have anything to complain about the food or service.  The wonton and dumplings are so meaty and good.  And the beef brisket is damn tender.  Definitely recommend!  Note they close really early everyday 8pm except on Wednesdays when they are closed all day"}
{"text":"Love this place. May look like a dive but it's where u can get cheap noodle in soup bowls and the wontons, dumplings and fish ball are homemade. Gotta check here for sure"}
{"text":"I had three toppings with soup on side. The noodles taste kinda funny when the after taste kicks in.  The beef slice has a slimy texture I think because they put a lot of flour into the beef. The taste of broth taste like dumpling.  I think is better if it had beef broth instead of dumpling taste. The tea tastes kinda odd."}
{"text":"One of the best chinese noodles/won ton places in the GTA I've ever been. Apparently opened for over 5 years according to their staff, can't believe I have not visited this place until a few months ago. Food is really good, I always go for the Pork with Chilli & Tomato Sauce Lo Mein(they call it \"jar lo\"), which is my go to. I also add extra noodles(\"ga dai\"). You can say \"jar lo ga dai\" Cantonese style if you are interested in trying it haha. The noodle is very chewy, which is very satisfying to eat. You can add the soup that comes on the side on the noodles, it tastes even better. I sometimes go for the won ton with noodles(\"wonton meen\"), the wontons are huge and the shrimps inside are very fresh. A great combo paired with the chewy egg noodles and refreshing soup. I also tried the beef brisket with noodles(\"lam meen\"), although not the best I have ever had in my life, I still consider it one of the best I could find in the GTA. The soup is strong in flavor but not heavy, which is what separates this restaurant to others in addition to their chewy egg noodles. Their super spicy sauce is also very well known, and they sell them in jars at the counter. Super fast and friendly service. All of these food mentioned above would arrive in less than 5 mins yet still taste very fresh. A must try place if you like chinese egg noodle with soup. Let me know if the Cantonese pronunciation of dishes that is in brackets work! I am very interested in knowing how it goes."}
{"text":"I love this location as it's a lot more convenient for me and it's a lot easier to get parking. Menu is same as other locations.  A bowl of wonton noodle soup starts from $6 depends on how many toppings you want to add on. My favourite is wonton noodle soup with either yellow egg noodles or rice noodles for $6; it comes with 4 huge shrimp wontons. Or you can add a second topping for $6.5   Good and fresh wonton, good price and convenient location."}
{"text":"I used to go here often as a child, but during my recent visit (which wasn't even that recent), I am less than impressed with this place. The wontons here are huge, I agree, but overall the noodle soups are all average and need the sauces to improve them. Like others have said, you need to self-serve tea and water. Not that big of an issue.  My problem is the cleanliness of this place. The decor is very basic, and the restaurant is very old considering it's been here for over 10 years. It's expected not to be the nicest of joints. I don't want to see bugs. That's all I have to say.   Very disappointed in this place considering my memories of it were a lot better."}
{"text":"For my foodies, this place is a legit noodle house.  The menu is simple, you choose your toppings:  dumplings, Dace fish balls (made fresh in house), beef, beef brisket, wonton.  Than your noodles: rice noodle, egg noodle.  I always get the egg noodles.  The noodles are fresh and paired with their broth they are nice and chewy.  So good!  And of course I get the in house fish balls, homemade goodness, tender and plump.  Service is quick and this is my go to place because it's made in house.  They even make their own chili oil!    Tis the season, it's noodle soup time!"}
{"text":"inheriting the simple menu concept from one of the best noodle places in hk (jim chai kee), wonton chai offers only few things on the board: wonton, sliced beef, fish balls, and beef brisket. they are to be consumed in soup form: by itself, with yellow noodle, flat rice noodle, or thin rice noodle.  on the menu, there are a few more things, which revolve around noodles in one form or another. nice addition for those who want to venture out of their staple items.   my bf and i ordered three dishes (bowls? lol) and a drink: 1. beef brisket w/thin rice noodle in soup--the meat is flavorful and tender, noodles cooked right. i only felt like the soup base, while tasty, could be just a tad stronger, like those we have in hk.  2. signature wonton in soup, on its own (no noodles)--flawless.  wonton skin is thin and soft, shrimps inside are fresh (i.e. no super strong white pepper smell to cover bad shrimp taste) and cooked al dente, soup base is flavorful. again, flawless.  3. yellow noodles (w/meat) in chilly tomato sauce, peking style (\"jin dao ja jiang mian\")--the yellow noodle is cooked perfectly, it's crunchy (al denta crunchy, not deep-fried crunchy!) and each strand just bounces between your teeth like it's on a trampoline! my only complaint is that the sauce--while a bit too \"saucy\"/watery and has mushroom and all in it, weird--is a bit too heavy on the spice--i know it is supposed to be a little spicy, but i was made to keep sipping my drink, which interfered my enjoyment of the noodle slightly, that's all. but the noodle itself made up for it; each crunchy bite was just too heavenly i couldn't stop eating it one bite after another. even my bf regretted ordering his rice noodle and said should've ordered the yellow noodle instead. which he should have--it's a flagship item!  ordered a cold soy bean milk as drink but it seems they either pre-made those or ordered from a vendor; it came in a take-out cup from their drink fridge. taste and level of sweetness are both ok, but since it may not be made on premise, i wouldn't count points against or towards them.   overall, this is a great place to get quality noodle and wonton. i'm only slightly disturbed that the cashier lady not only used no gloves when handling the raw noodles (it was down time; she was separating the big bunch of noodles into proper serving sizes), she only patted the flour off her hands when she went to take our bill and make changes. not only that, she THEN went straight back to touching the raw noodles, no washing hands in between necessary--gross!!!  yeah i know the noodles will be cooked in hot boiling water and all, so i can almost allow the no gloves situation. but touching other things (the counter, the cashier, the bills, the coins, the compartments inside the cashier, etc) then going right back to food??  that's begging for food contamination out loud.  methinks they really should pay attention to that.    even though we both felt a little thirsty/dry-mouthed after eating their noodles (MSG alert?), i would not hesitate to go back again. sidenote on Lynda W's comment about the \"vegetarian version\" of the soup: while just the noodle + soup combo seems vegetarian enough, people who are on a strict no-meat diet may want to make sure that the soup base isn't made with bones and meat as well. i highly doubt that is the case since bones and meat are usually what make the soup base savory, and most chinese places do not hesitate to use them.  last thing, i think they only appreciate cash. but this is a cheap eat place so one should at least be able to get something out of there with just loose change--especially when dollar \"bills\" actually come in coins in canada!"}
{"text":"My fav spot for wonton noodles around Toronto area. It's a must when I'm in town ! Really close to the wonton mein in Hong Kong. The noodles are not  soggy and the wontons are big and so much shrimps ! The dumplings are really good too and the fish paste/ball are good. I usually get the 2-3 kind toppings. So I get to eat all of them. Never a disappointment every time I come here and they have different locations."}
{"text":"Ok for a quick meal. Same concept as the other oversized wonton places - apparently this is opened by the son of the most famous one - except their wontons and fish balls are not that large.   Taste is fine - just what you'd expect and just as good as the \"parent location\". They also offer beef brisket, which is different, and actually, pretty good (though there isn't a lot of it if you get it in a double combo with something else). No wide noodles here though, which is too bad!  Veggies are good and the only side dish worth ordering. Don't bother with the overpriced fried fish skins because they do not make them in-house and they are no good."}
{"text":"Overall 3.5/5. Food came out fast and was really tasty and cheap. I had the lo mein with pork in chilli & tomato sauce and shrimp wontons. It comes with soup on the side. My only complaint is that there wasn't much pork - it was mostly just vegetables and mushrooms."}
{"text":"Good cheap fast tasty meal... Humongous wontons and dumplings. Noodles are fresh and soup is hot. All in all, perfect for satisfying all your wonton cravings. Rather heavy handed on the salt/MSG so be sure to have a bottle of water with you after your meal because you are going to be crazy thirsty!!"}
{"text":"If you like beef brisket, this would be a place to go to try it out.  They are very generous with their helpings of beef brisket, although the bowls do not look huge.  I usually have the beef brisket soup.  You can also choose the kind of noodles you want to have it with.  I have it mostly with hor fun (flat rice noodles) but today I decided to go with egg noodles.   Just as good.    One little warning.  Their hot chilli oil is super hot!  I usually put the chilli oil on the side and use it with every other spoonful but somehow, today I forgot and put it directly into my soup and oh boy!  I couldn't feel my mouth for a while!  Lol.  However it was still an overall very tasty bowl of beef brisket noodles.    What I also really like is their speed of getting the food on the table very quickly.  They do not have a huge variety on their menu, so that may also be part of the reason.  People come here mainly for their speciality which is either soup or dry noodles with wonton, beef brisket, special fish dumplings.  Very basic but their soup stock, especially for the beef brisket is awesome!  Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"4 Stars! Simple noodles and wontons with decent broth. The service is pretty fast and the menu is simple and easy to understand. The wontons are really large and super juicy. I highly recommend the shrimp wontons. You can guarantee that you'll be full with just one bowl - it's surprisingly deceiving. I'm definitely coming back!  This place only accepts cash!"}
