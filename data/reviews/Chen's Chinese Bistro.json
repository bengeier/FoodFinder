{"text":"Have been here a couple of times. They are SUPPER friendly. The First time we went my shrimp lo me in had a funny taste to it but they exchanged it. My fault for ordering seafood in AZ ;)   today we went and the food we great. Very reasonable, especially for lunch."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and helpful, food tasted very good, and the meal was affordable, but the shrimp gave my wife food poisoning and she has felt sick for the next day and a half."}
{"text":"good food, good service, good chinese music! and there is a big room for the party! nice!"}
{"text":"The service was AMAZING!!!  The food is decent, however agree that if you want something exotic you will need to leave the confines of Gilbert ;)  The lunch portions are huge, and my husband and I paid approx $20 (including tip) for two lunch specials and two sodas.....really good value.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I had the Mongolian Beef, egg drop soup lunch. Under 7.00... Everything was great except for the egg roll. The inside was mushy. I asked the server if they make them in house, and he tried to change the subject... He eventually said I don't think so... I know so, they were nasty! I'll visit again, and I will asked if they will substitute the egg roll."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for the past 4 years and find the food very good.  For my tasteI have to ask them to make all my dishes extra spicy.  My favorite dis is their vegetable fried rice.  They are also very nice folks and at times when my order is over a certain amount they include a hot and sour soup for free...now that is a noce touch I think!"}
{"text":"This specific Chens has good Chinese food. It's fresh, decently priced, and has good portion sizes. The staff is friendly. I've ate at several Chinese bistros in and around the Phoenix area, even other states and they provide quality tasty food. I'd recommend to anyone to try this Chen's. And don't mix this Chen with the others."}
{"text":"Great  Chinese Food. Great location on Chandler/Gilbert line...quick turn around for take out...large portions...FRESH vegetables...food is not soaking in oil...the best Egg Foo Yung I've ever had---full of fresh vegetables in a light sauce"}
{"text":"I was headed home from the mall and figured I'd stop here for a bite to eat. My first impression normal, the place is lit well and gives has a cozy feel. The staff was helpful and willing to answer any questions I had about the menu. I ordered the Almond Cashew Chicken, which came out in relatively quickly and came with a bowl of white rice. I absolutely cannot complain about the quality of the dish, and even needed a box to take the rest home. All in all great choice for chinese cuisine. 5/5"}
{"text":"Disappointing all around, greasy, pre-prepared, tasteless meal.  Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Not bad...not great. Definitely give them a try if you're in the area and craving Chinese. The won ton chip and sweet sour sauce is something I'd liken to the Chinese rendition of chips and salsa. Nothing special by any means, but edible, if a tad greasy. The menu is not very extensive here, but I appreciated that rice was served with entrees.   The service this evening was a tad on the slow side. Not a big deal, they were understandably very busy on this weekend night and quite popular. A bunch of us showed up at the same time to be seated. The booths are comfortable and seating near the front window allowed for pleasant conversation as noise levels in the middle of the dining area seemed quite loud.  The hot sour soup is a bit too sweet, but hearty and filled with lots of great ingredients, like tofu, shrimp, veggies and such. The mapo tofu was kinda \"meh\" and tasted a bit off- almost a bit cinnamon-y. The veggie and tofu was great. All in all, a decent meal I'd give a 6-7."}
{"text":"Poor service and even worse food.  Will never return."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTING ! My father and I were searching for a new Chinese place to try out.. and came across Chen's Chinese Bistro. Barely edible is how I would describe this food. Not only that, but the staff could BARELY understand/speak english. I ordered the Double Pan Fried Noodles thinking it would be comparable to PF Changs ( stupid I know) and out came a slab of hard ramen.. raw veggies.. and what looked like raw meat piled on the ramen.  The only positive thing i WILL say is that the restaurant was VERY clean.. but how could it get dirty if no customers are going in and out? YUCK!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Chen's! After discovering chance about six months ago, this is the only place I get Chinese food. The gentleman who takes the order for my husband and I doesn't know us by name but normally knows us by our order.   We prefer the orange chicken with pork fried rice and chicken chow mein."}
{"text":"Ordered the moo goo pai chicken. Wait time was very quick but it was very bland and customer service was poor also. Older lady with a thick accent took my order and since I couldnt understand her entirely she got rude. Would never come back"}
{"text":"As fresh as fresh can get! Made when ordered. The lettuce wraps and war won ton soup is delish! Recommended :)"}
{"text":"All I can say is that the food here was YUCKY.  It was cold and tasted premade.  They brought the food out within 2 or 3 minutes of us ordering, so there is no friggin way they cooked it for us.  Panda Express is better than this, so called food. Is there a real Chinese restaurant in the valley?  Been here 2 months and haven't found one yet."}
{"text":"At first it seems like an average Chinese take out type place but we sat down and were brought some water by a man that seemed to be the manager he also took our orders and brought us our food. The food came quite quickly to our delight. The actual service was below mediocre and the food tasted like dog food. My boyfriend and I ordered two plates he got the teriyaki and I got the Kung pao which contained raw peanuts thrown on top of thinly sliced overcooked meat covered in some mysterious sauce that tasted like a dogs gravy. I informed the man that I didn't like the dish and his response was a scowl and then he walked away......still charged us even though I only took two bites from the whole plate. I will never be coming back."}
{"text":"Always great Chinese food!! Best almond chicken! Tons of food, fresh and made to order! Owner is very nice. They will leave out what you don't like too. Plus fast service"}
{"text":"A decent, somewhat typical Americanized chinese restaurant.  If you're looking for kung pao chicken, beef broccoli, etc, Chen's will fit the bill.  I typically prefer more authentic chinese food, and if you're looking for that, don't come here (you'll need to visit Chandler).  Still, the food is acceptable albeit somewhat lacking in seasonings.  Portions are large, which is nice.  You can expect leftovers.  The staff is friendly, and they have a good attitude.  It seems like they care about the quality of the restaurant and experience of the diners.  I expect this restaurant will improve with time (I believe they just opened?).  Price isn't bad, especially considering the large portions."}
{"text":"This is probably my family's favorite Chinese food restaurant. The workers are always very friendly and the food is always delicious! Great prices, as well... especially their lunch specials! I have never had to wait for a table, which is nice, in this world of busy schedules and impatient lifestyles. This is definitely a hidden gem that we will continue to patronize! Thank you Chen's!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place! I was a regular customer and was treated more like a friend.  The food not to mention was consistently amazing!  The lunch specials are priced very well too.  UnFortunately, Im moving away, but will always stop in when in the area."}
{"text":"I moved to Gilbert and tried this place out. The food was not good at all. So bland. There was no flavor or enjoyment. Please save yourself some time and money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I went to this location after hearing it was #2 best Asian cuisine in Gilbert in some survey. Yes, I was impressed with the service and the food. I have only tried the Mongolian Beef for the lunch specials, but everything included was great. I can't wait to try the other items. Vic was an awesome host there and he knows what service should be like in the otherwise poor service norm these days! Please go check this place out."}
{"text":"Have had the lunch menu a couple times in the last month while in Chandler on business, really good food at a very fair price."}
{"text":"Portion size was ample, got a selection of chicken chow mein (the chicken in this was SO good, but the noodles were a bit oily for my preference), fried rice (the egg was plentiful in this, which for my egg intolerant hubby is a bad thing, I however, thought it was great) moo goo gai pan (a bit bland for my taste), orange chicken (good) and a cup of hot and sour soup. Overall it was a good meal and we had plenty of leftovers. Will definitely try again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, the food is always good. Service is excellent. I like the Chicken Curry and Husband likes the peppered beef."}
{"text":"The food is good and you get enough so you're not hungry again in a few hours. The Kung pao was spicier than most other I've tasted but I like it hot. I'll be. Back."}
{"text":"If you're in search of an amazing Chinese restaurant, look no further! I was very pleased with my experience at Chen's Chinese Bistro.   As soon as I walked in, I was warmly welcomed and seated. The ambiance of this restaurant was nice. My order was taken quickly and by a helpful waitress. While waiting for my food, I was kept busy by the many televisions and upbeat music.   My order arrived in no time. The presentation of the food was neat, which was nice. I ordered the lunch combination of the black pepper chicken. With my order, I also received a crap puff, egg roll, and rice. The chicken was filled with amazing spices and was absolutely delicious.   I highly recommend Chen's Chinese Bistro if you're looking for scrumptious Chinese food. Overall, this restaurant had amazing customer service and food. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Kind of annoying I walked up to the door 45 minutes before closing, and they were already shutting it down. Bad for business. I won't be back. The girls and the male server just stared at me and went back to cleaning and talking without approaching the door."}
{"text":"Ordered take out again tonight!  Their food is delicious and fresh.  We especially like their lettuce wraps, egg rolls, hot and sour soup, Kung Pao chicken, chicken lo mein, and potstickers!  Dining in is also a great choice-- quiet, peaceful atmosphere with friendly staff! We highly recommend Chen's!!"}
{"text":"WORST FOOD EVER!!! Waste of money and time.  Service was rude had the lunch special, was nothing special about it! Had shrimp lo mein, shrimp smelled bad.. If you have high expectations do not eat here. I don't recommend!"}
{"text":"There's several Chen's around the valley.  Eaten at a couple others besides the one on Market St. in Gilbert.  This location trumps them all.  I've been here several times.  Great service. Courteous and friendly staff.  Food is hot and fast to come out.  My wife and I love having lunch here across from the San Tan Mall.  Food is delicious and a good value for what you get.  I lived in Korea for a while and my wife is Vietnamese so we know good asian food. It's somewhat hard to find in Arizona."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Chinese food in the area.  I'm happy they opened near us.  The General chicken is good and the ribs are good too."}
{"text":"Love this place food is always fresh. They bring out fried won tons to start like chips. Egg drop soup is then served with meal. I ordered Mongolian beef and added shrimp to it, served family style. The generals chicken is also good with a little spice. Option of fried rice or white rice we got the fried so good."}
{"text":"It's good, convenient and it's one of the few Chinese restaurants that cooks with gluten free soy sauce.  I'm sensitive to wheat/gluten and great tasting fast food is not really an option anymore.  I especially love their pork fried rice, beef chow fun and chicken and vegetable with the white garlic sauce.  Big portions too - we always get at least 2 meals - dinner and lunch the next day!  Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have found in Arizona in over 30 years, that's saying quite a bit for someone from New York"}
{"text":"Awesome food and the People who work here take time to explain any of the menu's options for you! Amazing food, highly recommend!  Kat"}
{"text":"I really like Chen's and come here regularly.  My husband and I usually get the family dinner for two which includes soup, a shrimp appetizer, and egg rolls along with two entrees and rice.  I love the chicken dishes that include lots of vegetables, but don't care for the ones, such as sesame chicken, which are nothing but meat.  I just have a hard time believing that families in China come home to dinner and have meals that are all meat.  But this seems to be typical of Chinese restaurants in America, so make sure you order some veggies on the side if you want a balanced meal!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Gilbert, portions and pricing is perfect amount, environment is great for family and great for date , very consistent which is important to me"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I have had. Period.  I travel for a living and experience many different dining establishments and this tips the list for excellent Chinese food with fast and friendly service.  Stop by and see what I mean."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Staff was awesome. Price is awesome. All I can say is amazing!!!  The never let my drink go below half and the food was cooked to my preference.   You done here and you won't regret it other than maybe regret not eating more    ENJOY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Taste was great but evrrything wss a little greasy for my taste."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and comfortable. We ordered take out and everything was ready as promised. The texture of the egg Foo young was different but the meat and vegetables were fresh and tasty.  The help was friendly and efficient. The price was reasonable and a good value."}
{"text":"We get massage at their Oriental Foot Spa, call in a pick up order at Chen Bistro !  Very relaxing, excellent food!   We love everything we order!  Very relaxing day, great dinner!!!"}
{"text":"We have been going to this restaurant about once a month and never had a bad meal. great food and service. I don't usually eat Chinese food but this is so good."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time to grab takeout for Christmas dinner.  The service was excellent, large portions of food for the price, and dinner for 5 was ready in about 10 minutes.  We're moving out of the area otherwise we would come back here to eat in the restaurant.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and it's our first visit. We ordered dinner portions so we would have left overs. We got the Chicken lo mein, Honey Sesame Chicken, and Orange Chicken and lunch size Teriyaki Chicken. All was good, the Orange Chicken was a little sweet, but good. Our favorite was the cream cheese wontons (angel blossoms) very delicious.  We ordered the egg drop soup, it was just OK. We also ordered pork egg rolls, could barely tell they  had pork, not much inside as it had 98% veggies.  I'll have to stick with Pei Wei for pork egg rolls. Great service, clean.. We will be back."}
{"text":"Crap..... giving two stars only because waitress was helpful. Shrimp is extremely fishy and everyone else's food was bland."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese places in the East Valley. Authentic and food is amazing! I always get the sesame chicken, but have tried the orange chicken as well. Owner is very friendly and the food comes out quickly."}
{"text":"This place is not worth the money... its expensive and everything tastes like a good frozen meal from a bag... literally nothing special about this place at all... EVERYTHING could be better!  You know if it were cheaper, I could deal with the mediocre quality, but I expect more from a Chinese place with this price tag..."}
{"text":"We order from here quite frequently. Always ready in 10-15 min, and super yummy. I usually get cashew chicken and Potstickers. Great service and friendly staff. Plus so close to my house :) I would definitely recommend this place for good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Just another Chinese place that gets its meals from some sort of Chinese meal warehouse. If you get Chinese you know how frequently these meals look And taste the same. Cheap grayish meats and ingredients. Well Chens is no different."}
{"text":"The staff at Chen's is amazing. The food is consistently great and not greasy! My husband and I eat here at least once a month and now feel like family when we come in.   If you want something fast and good without a wait on a Friday/ Sat night drop in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"So far this is the best tasting Chinese food that I can find in the valley. Always consistent and the flavor is amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing good!! Very comfortable, easy going atmosphere. Three TVs to watch a game...no sound. The portions are big! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We tried Chens for the first time a couple weeks ago and we've been back twice since. We ordered our food Togo and it was great!"}
{"text":"This Chinese food hit the spot!  With the open yet cozy floor plan and the family-run friendly service, this lunch was a truly delightful  one!  Wow........for $6.50 daily lunch special is a deal!   You can choose either  a small soup-choice of egg drop, hot and sour for $1.00 upgrade, wonton soup, an egg roll, a cream cheese wonton, a really mini salad, choice of entree and white or fried rice!  The wonton soup was good, the angel blossom, crispy and the black pepper chicken, tasty!  We enjoyed the fresh, hot Chinese donuts we ordered for the birthday girl!  I will travel miles again to dine at this bistro!!"}
{"text":"New favorite Chinese restaurant. Love Chinese food and have probably tried 15 different ones. Greeted as we entered with smiles and great attitude. Jackie was our waitress. Very knowledgable on the menu. Lunch special was 7 and included soup egg roll and optional fried rice. I had the egg foo young. The best. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Their door says they are OPEN until 9:00pm. We arrived at 8:45pm and the woman said they are only open for takeout starting At 8:45pm. They wouldn't seat us. Seems like a practice that is meant to benefit the employees over the customers."}
{"text":"My mother raves about their Chicken Noodle Soup so I had to drop by and get some. Added an order of Combo Fried Rice and some chicken wings. Very good experience  - I would recommend anything on the menu but am a huge fan of the combo fried rice - love the fact that they have bean sprouts in the rice"}
{"text":"Ecellent value. Great food.  Fantastic service. Lunch specials and menu. Dinner includes soup. Larger than average portions. They also have take out. We have eaten here at least 5 times, very consistent!!"}
{"text":"It has been difficult to find a Chinese restaurant in the Chandler area that has really great hot and sour soup - Chen's definitely has the best recipe we have found since living in the San Francisco Bay Area.  We really like the Orange Chicken, egg rolls, soup and salad that is served on their lunch menu.  Also, the prices are very reasonable for lunch!  Hope you try it and enjoy it."}
{"text":"Went in there a few months back...finally got my Yelp account set up so just now writing about this horribly, unforgettable dining experience....  We went in and were seated immediately, considering there were only two other parties in there at the time. We ordered our food, my daughter asked for milk with her kids meal, the lady said \"We don't have milk.\" and began rattling off soft drink names...my daughter is 6, she doesn't drink soda...so I said \"water is fine.\" We waited about 15-20 minutes, our food came out, along with extra plates...as everyone started to dig in, I grabbed one of the extra plates and noticed dried food it....I waited until someone came by to check on us and I mentioned to the guy \"This plate is dirty.\" His reply \"Oh, I'm sorry,  let me bring you another one.\" and went off to bring me another plate...dropped it off and went about his business. I grabbed that plate and it too had dried food on it...I was ready to get up and leave at this point, but everyone was already chowing down. I got his attention once more and said \"This plate is dirty too.\" this time, he studied it closely as if I was lying lol..and said \"Oh, well you know...these things happen.\" and left....Needless to say, we finished up, most of my food ended up in a doggy bag, and eventually in the trash when I got home because I was just grossed out. Never again."}
{"text":"Great food at a phenomenal price! The lunch special is a TON of food for $7 and soooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed Chen's Chinese bistro. Their chicken is actually very well breaded and cooked just enough to where you get that crunch but not a ton of oil. Another positive is you get a decent portion size per meal. However one thing that irked me the most was the service provided, only because there was one other table and it took the waitress 10 minutes to come take out order. Service aside, I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I usually frequent the Chen's at Riggs & McQueen...great food by the way. Was in the area of this one and thought I'd give them a shot. Ordered Chicken with veggies...mostly cabbage...no corn or bok choy and lacked the flavor."}
{"text":"First time...we had chicken with veg's and shrimp with lobster sauce. Food very fresh and reasonably priced. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Got take out tonight, everything was top notch! We had General Tso and Sweet/Sour Chicken, House Fired Rice and Chow Mein. I love Chinese food and I'm usually satisfied no matter the place. But Chen's was the first place in a long time that I really noticed a difference in quality and flavor. You can tell they put a little extra care in the prep and seasoning. It was definitely enough for me to go the extra mile when I have that craving instead of just settling for the average closest place. Thank you guys so much and we will be seeing you again soon!"}
{"text":"Hi this was the worst Chinese food I have had. The food was bland and with out the hot sausage no taste. Moo SHO was tasteless and pork over cooked."}
{"text":"We ordered take out for the first time tonight and loved it, we ill be back!  This is how Chinese is supposed to be."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are fab. For $6 you get an entree with soup, a crab wonton, and a rice or  another side. I love the General's chicken. No frills cheap place to eat. Portions are huge. This is the one off of Market street near San Tan Mall."}
{"text":"First of all- the food here was really incredible! Definitely legit Chinese food that we have a hard time finding in the valley. All the veggies were crisp and cooked perfectly, sauces were not salty and fried things were crispy but not greasy in the least. The egg drop soup was some of the best I have ever had! I am completely impressed.  But service was horrible. They need more staff to manage walk ins with all of the pick up orders. Staff was treating those delivery people horribly- it was embarrassing. If you have an hour and a half to spare, it's worth the wait... but bring your patience. I do have to say they tried to apologize for being so late and slow but it was pretty bad..."}
{"text":"Very nice people gets two stars.   The food gets no stars. Terrible. Buy a Swanson frozen dinner and it will be the same. Meats were unseasoned when cooked and drenched in corn starch gloopy sauces t differentiate dishes. Veg was cooked from frozen.   If you like Panda then maybe."}
{"text":"My to-go lunch combo order was quickly preparedbut was incorrect. Sesame honey chicken was not bad but very sweet. I was excited to try  the eggflower soup but was given a spring roll instead. Fried rice was tasty though I asked for steamed.  Willing to try again."}
{"text":"We tried this place because of the other Yelp reviews. We agree with the 4 star rating. The location is easy to find, the prices were reasonable and the food was delicious. The ambiance was OK - nothing special. They have dark wood tables and lots of booths.  Our server had a little attitude (older guy with a crew cut) but he served us efficiently. There was a younger woman who came by our table and asked how our food was - she was sweet."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed and we visited based on Yelp reviews.  The food was okay but not spectacular.  I can't see myself visiting this place again.  We were served promptly and the food came out in under 7 minutes.  It just wasn't impressive though.  I'd rather spend an extra $15 and go to PF Changs."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food for dine-in or take-out! Great service! Their General Tso's is a must try one-of-a-kind specialty. And I love that their food isn't overtly greasy like your typical Chinese food."}
{"text":"They have a great menu and awesome food. We have never been disappointed and love coming here. We usually carry out."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here with my parents and we love it! They had a good price for a lunch special that gives you soup, eggroll and a big portion of your main course! The food was delicious! The service was also very good! I would recommend this place to everyone! Try it out and see what you think, but I know you won't be disappointed! :)"}
{"text":"Ordered food for delivery. I ordered the double pan fried noodles combo for $10.95, ordered the hot and sour soup $6.95 and I ordered one order of egg rolls $2.95 my order on my calculator came to the total of $20.85 with taxes even at a 7.8 which would have be $1.62 my order would have been $22.47  I was wondering why did they charge me $25.55 and according to the delivery driver that $25.55 did not include the tip. How come? There food is good but I think they need to explain on the receipt how much each individual item is. I feel I got taken. So beware when ordering delivery."}
{"text":"This was good! Went here based on the other positive reviews and was not disappointed. We had the Sichuan Style beef and the Sweet and Sour chicken and enjoyed both. The Sichuan beef was not quite as spicy as I hoped it would be, but the spice built and overall the meat and vegetables were both good. The sweet and sour tasted similar to how it tastes in China - sweet, but not quite as sweet as most sweet and sour sauces do in America. Both dishes were served promptly by a friendly waitress and were hot and fresh when brought to the table.  This is somewhat of a hidden gem. We had driven past here a lot of times previously and never noticed it was here, so hopefully positive Yelp reviews will help it get the patronage it deserves."}
{"text":"The  $7 lunch special is a lot of food.  Had the Human beef.  The beef was really tender, just the right amount of spice.  We have a new go to for our Chinese food craving."}
{"text":"Me and The husband decided to try this place out after the movies. The fried rice had a dirty dish water flavor. The potstickers were a tad bit oily but still tasted good. Our soups were good also, we had egg drop and hot n sour. Maybe their oil was old?"}
{"text":"I just got off work from Outback Steakhouse that is right across the street from Chen's. I was extremely dog tired and hungry from a long day's work serving tables and wanted to get a quick bite to eat. I carelessly walked into the restaurant and realized that it was empty and they were 2 minutes to closing (I was that guy). I immediately said I would go somewhere else but they stopped and insisted that I could order something to-go.   I ordered the generals chicken and had a blue moon while I waited for my order and talked with the owner. I realized that I have seen them at outback steakhouse before as guests in our restaurant and remembered how nice they were. The order took less than 5 minutes and I was on my way back home.   Food was still very hot and tasted really good. Broccoli, peppers chicken appropriately seasoned and spiced to my liking. Definitely will return to try other entrees. Thank you Chen's!"}
{"text":"Really good, go here all the time. Always order out, done in about 15 minutes. portions are always really big, and never soggy. Staff here is always super friendly as well."}
{"text":"Friendly prompt service. The food seemed to be made from quality ingredients but it lacked flavor. Great spot for people who like mild flavors. My husband and I prefer spicy so he gave his a 2/5 but mine was 3/5."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food was good and the service was excellent. We will definitely be back. When I first looked at the menu I was thinking Kung Pao chicken but our waiter recommended Hunan chicken. It was great and now we will need to come back to try the Kung Pao."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Always fresh and up to expectations! Service is okay. A couple of friends and I went to lunch there and the waitress kept coming over after we paid she also kept staring at us from a far. After 15 minutes of this we were all very uncomfortable. I understand if they need the seats but there was no one waiting and it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Food was over priced and not good. I called to get dinner delivered for the first time and they told me that I was over the 3 mile radius. When I explained that I was right down the street, they said that they still could not deliver!   I would suggest going to Panda Express before making this trip."}
{"text":"Excellent homemade Asian food! Great price for lunch specials $7! General Chicken has always been great."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese Restaurant.  Casual dining with a small bar.  Great service and the food was very good.  Pricing is in line with other small, family restaurants.  If you are in this area and want Chinese food, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and service!  I appreciate the fact that they are very accommodating and will do special orders to accommodate vegetarians and allergies! My wife eats extremely spicy food and it's the only restaurant that makes food spicy enough when she says extra extra spicy. Love the family oriented atmosphere.  If you love Chinese food give this restaurant a try I can guarantee you will not regret it. Thank you everyone at Chens for the amazing dinner and service!"}
{"text":"I'm a patient at Mercy Gilbert. Was looking for some comfort and tasty food after being stuck with hospital food all day.  Called to place an order, asked if they could do a cup of the Hot & Sour instead of a quart with no pork or shrimp. At first they said an 18 oz. Was available, then told me they'd charge $5 for the quart since there was no meat. I ordered the soup.  Asked if I could get the garlic sauce on mixed vegetables and they said \"if you did that, we'd order the garlic entree, no chicken then you'd just have bell pepper\". Um. I wanted the mixed veggies, not just a bunch of bell pepper. What's so hard about throwing the garlic sauce on veggies unless it's premade, sitting out for hours... I ordered the mixed veggies as is... didn't want to confuse anyone  Btw, I work in a restaurant. Their rude behavior and laziness is nonexcusable. I didn't ask them to make anything off menu.  Since I'm stuck in the hospital, I sent my friend to pick up the food. When he arrived, the worker rudely informed him they would never make the soup like \"that\" again. Oh, were you forced to make a fresh batch with no meat? Maybe you shouldn't be in the restaurant business or offer CUPS of soup so sick people in the hospital can eat.   The food tasted like CORN SYRUP. Staff was rude. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I'm sad in a way to write this review.  I love and support local.  And, with all the 4 and 5-star reviews we saw, we were excited.  But, frankly, it was quite a letdown.  We went in on a weekday at dinner time, and we were the only customers.  We figured, well, it's a Tuesday.  Maybe that's it.  We saw a steady flow of takeout customers.  The one lady working was very, very nice.  We asked how the rice noodles were prepared.  She said, \"uh, peppers, onions.\"  We said, hmmm, okay.  But, when it came out - it was more like an Indian dish full of curry and very very green - not at all what we expected.  The Orange Chicken was nothing special - we would have been better off quality and price wise at Panda Express.  So, all in all, we recommend you trying another local place - there are a couple near-by that have much better quality.  Again, sad to write this but this is what Yelp is here for."}
{"text":"It usually takes a good word of mouth review from a friend for me to try a new Chinese restaurant. However, I was craving this cuisine and this restaurant is close by and tucked away in a small quiet strip mall. Wasn't busy at all on a Friday evening. We were greeted right away as we entered into the clean, open, no frills dining room. We ordered beef and broccoli, chicken fried rice and lo mien. As we waited our super friendly server offered bowls of egg drop soup on the house. The soup was a nice touch but nothing superb. I was satisfied with our meal but it was not the best I've tasted. Fried rice was a little bland. Beef and broccoli was delicious. Overall I'd say the service was way better than the food."}
{"text":"Have only had the sweet-and-sour chicken, but It was good --takes about 10 minutes and the workers are courteous and friendly.  It is close by and I will probably go back again until I find a better sweet and sour chicken.."}
{"text":"Food is always good and the lady that runs the place is always so friendly.  We dine in and carry out, never disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to sit down and enjoy some good food. Everything is fresh made once you order it and always come out hot. I've tried a couple things and all have been good. So far the go to is generals chicken. Staff has always been friendly for me and the beer and wine selection make it a decent place to grab a drink and snack as well."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is not busier.  I know they do a lot of carry out business, but the restaurant is usually mostly empty.  The food is really good and inexpensive.  I really like their pork egg fu young.  My wife usually gets their chicken and broccoli.  Both are very good.  Sometimes we only get one entree and share because the servings are pretty big. The food is served quickly so I don't see how it can be completely freshly prepared, but it tastes like it.  The entrees come with rice.  Sometimes we get one of their soups.  We are always very pleased with the food and the service.  If you call ahead for carry out, they will have your order in ten to fifteen minutes."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is good. Keg was packed so we decided to try this restaurant and we were pleasantly surprised. We both agree this place is at the top of our list now for Chinese! Food is excellent, staff is very friendly, and the price quite reasonable. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After all this time looking for good Chinese food, Chen's Chinese Bistro was quite a disappointment. When my son's food arrived he complained to me that the egg roll was cold inside. Then when I finally got my food, they brought me the wrong order. I told the waiter and when he finally brought me the right order 15 minutes later, he did not even apologize for the mistake. I do not plan to return to this restaurant. Bad service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Happened to be driving by and hungry. Stopped in based on the other reviews and Yum!! We ordered twice cooked pork and chicken and veggies- both excellent. Great service and ambience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!! We eat there often enough the owner knows our order!! seriously the staff is so attentive the place is clean the food is AMAZING! My husband likes his food spicy and has asked for them to heat it up and they always will then they always check to see if it's too hot and it's always just right! Never a bad experience there! They have gone above and beyond can't say enough good things about them! Do yourself and favor and try them out!!!"}
{"text":"Just ate here with my family! The fried rice is superb. Absolutely delicious! I asked for extra spicy Kung pao chicken but it wasn't as spicy as I had hoped. The egg drop soup was also fantastic! Definitely coming back here"}
{"text":"This place just opened so I decided to give it a try. I was impressed!!! Very nice decor & employees. You can't beat their lunch special. $6 for your entree plus choice of rice. (I get brown rice.) plus comes with egg roll, angel blossom, and salad! I even had leftovers for later. Great place & I will be visiting more often."}
{"text":"I must have gone here on a bad day, because I don't get these four star reviews. Had take out from here several months ago, and it was pretty decent. Not this time!! The chicken in a dish tasted rubbery...the beef in the Mongolian Beef was very chewy. The shrimp fried rice really lacked flavor. The pork roles were decent, but could have used more meat, I have had better. The staff was ok, not very friendly."}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp.  Food was average,  service wad awesome!  It's next to the mall so lots of parking."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! You get a ton of food for extremely reasonable prices. Service is great, always quick and always checks in to make sure we have everything we need.  I tend to eat lunch here pretty frequently because it is a guaranteed great experience."}
{"text":"Wow, surprised by the less than stellar reviews recently.  Went here for lunch a couple weeks ago, and I LOVED it.  Service was great, and the food was SO GOOD!  (and cheap since it was lunch hours)  I will absolutely be back here.  I wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"Chen's Chinese Bistro is hands down the worst Chinese restaurant I've been to anywhere across the country. Anybody that gives this restaurant more than one star has absolutely no idea what Chinese cuisine is supposed to taste like.  I ordered the food to go.   I ordered the Double Pan Fried Noodles with Steak with the noodles packed in a separate container from the veggies and steak to make sure the noodles weren't completely soggy when I got home. When I opened the noodles, they were not pan fried, they were pan burnt. The veggies, steak and sauce was rather bland and the steak portion was small.  I also ordered the Shrimp Lo Mein. The noodles were bland and the few shrimp that were in the dish were completely tasteless and smelled like they weren't exactly fresh.  I'd have to say you're better off at a chain like Panda Express if you want lower end taste and don't mind paying a premium for it. Do yourself a favor and skip it."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese -American We were a party of 4 and they got two orders wrong with a thin apology or discount for screwing it up.  Wouldn't go again, probably won't be around long with service like that."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant since 2011. I only do take out, quick service and friendly staff. My favorites are Kung Pao (all types) and Mongolian beef. I have yet to be disappointed;"}
{"text":"I just really like their double pan friend chow mein.  It's far out for me since I live in Tempe, but if we lived closer we'd order out from here all the time."}
{"text":"I was here yesterday for their grand opening and I must say I was quite impressed with the food and the service. I've been to their other location that was a 40 minute drive away and the food there was worth the trip. This new location is only 10 minutes away and I predict I'll be here 4 days a week now!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great! Loved the garlic chicken, a great staff and was very clean..."}
{"text":"I have ordered in and for take out a few times now. Ordering in definitely has its perks,  complimentary soup and the freshness of dining in can't be beat. I love the General Chicken.  Light tempura battered chicken in a delicious and slightly spicy sauce. I also enjoy the Kung Pao Chicken but prefer it with less onions and celery. Egg Rolls are $3 for two and worth every penny. You can ask for your entrees as spicy as you like but they do warn you if you order it spicier  than you can take it's on you.  Overall great food, delightful service and I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Good,  been to China,  this is not China,  but the sweet and sour was similar to what we had there.  Not super sweet.  Not someplace to go to impress because the decor is pedestrian.  But I would go back"}
{"text":"Yes, it does smell like sewer. First time here and the food was good. I don't think I'll be back again. Maybe Panda down the road."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area,  best Chinese food I've had in a long time!  I'll be a regular soon!"}
{"text":"Chen's is a very friendly little local small business in SanTan Village. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside it is very beautiful and calming. My wife and I didn't have to wait at all and were able to be seated right off the bat. Our waitress immediately attended us and answered all our questioned about the items on the menu. We found that almost everything we wanted from a Chinese restaurant was on the menu and we ordered the orange chicken, beef and broccoli, and lo mein dishes. We could tell that they were all cooked fresh and made to order. All the dishes were hot and delicious. The broccoli with the beef was amazingly fresh tasting and was our personal favorite. Everything arrived within a timely manner and before we received egg rolls and egg drop soup. Both were great, and the atmosphere was very peaceful while we talked with each other. The waitress occasionally refilled our drinks without bothering us. The staff is very friendly and hard working: it was a very good experience overall, and I would very much recommend Chen's to anyone in the Gilbert/SanTan area."}
{"text":"Love going here. Food is great and big portions. Staff is very friendly and remember you."}
{"text":"I stopped in to order to go.  It was about 1:30, so the lunch hour had passed.  There was 2 tables with people eating.  The place has nice ambiance and seems comfortable to stay and dine.  The restaurant had an unpleasant odor that was a bit off putting.   Order was done quickly and ready to take home.   The chicken was way to salty and the flavor very bland.  The fried rice was looks like a brown soy sauce was mixed in it and no egg or veggies like I am familiar.  The Egg rolls had no flavor. Yes, I have experience a lot better Chinese food  Back to looking for a \"favorite\" Chinese place."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Their Lo Mein with shrimp is phenomenal. If you haven't gone here you haven't lived"}
{"text":"Yuck yuck and more yuck!  Nothing we ordered was edible.  Is there any good Chinese in the East Valley????"}
{"text":"It's so hard to find good legit Chinese food but I absolutely love this place! It's a bit of a drive from where I am but it's worth it! My husband and I go here and get good affordable food! It's a family owned restaurant I believe, and it's usually not too packed but most people order take out here instead of eating here. They give you good amounts of food, but a little less on the rice... But still ... Plenty of food. I could never finish haha! The generals chicken and honey sesame chicken are my fave :)!"}
{"text":"Best Fried Rice I ever had!  Been in Mesa 2 weeks and have eaten there twice!  Have also eaten 4 different entree's and they have all been good!q  It's worth the drive to me and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The BEST Chinese food around! We love their mixed vegetables, honey seared chicken, angel blossoms, & sweet and sour sauce (ask for some on the side). Clean. Friendly/attentive staff. Lunch specials are a great deal!"}
{"text":"We love chens  The service is always really fast and attentive and the food is very good for the value! We love going here!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service and good prices! Service has been good all the times I've been here. In fact the server has gone out her way to accommodate my order. I will continue to frequent this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Always come here for lunch special! The teriyaki chicken is one of my favorite! They are also pretty fast with service. Just my opinion though, you just have to find out for yourself"}
{"text":"So recently moved to gilbert and every place we have gone to has been amazing. So we opted for Chinese, spoiled by amazing service this place was the exact opposite.  1. I am not sure if the husband and wife are the owners. But they feel like it's okay to yell at each other in Chinese loud back and forth while people were eating and on the phone.  2. The lady was in such hurry to get our food that she did not allow me to ask questions about the menu. And with drinks before we finished ordering she left. 3.A family was there that had their CC declined and the lady was so loud about it that everyone else was hearing what was going on. 4. We ordered appetizers, chicken skewers and egg rolls. Both were horrible. Skewers tasted like rubber. And supper salty. Egg roll soggy! 5. Meal I got Kung Pao wife got tofu. So salty we did not eat it.  6. Went to the restroom and there was a person before us that had thrown up all over the place. I let the lady know and we bounced. All together really bad food and experience. Will not be going back! I have no idea why this place has a 4 star review we made sure to look at it before going in."}
{"text":"My third time here and have never been disappointed. The lunch special is $7 for one of 16 entrees and comes with spring roll and angel blossom plus choice of soup or salad and choice of brown, white or fried rice.  A real bargain with generous portions."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had since leaving NY 10 years ago!  The Orange Chicken melted in my mouth and the Vegetable LoMein was cooked to perfection. All fresh ingredients used.  We started with All Star Starter Platter...presentation was like something off the Food Network and it tastes just as good as it looked.     Service was FANTASTIC!!!  And the price was more than reasonable for the large portions they serve."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is great- by far the best chinese in this area. Also the service is fantastic. They always get the order correct and include all extras without having to ask."}
{"text":"Good service and the food came fast and hot. Clue - any Chinese restaurant with the word bistro in it is an undercover way of saying it is not authentic Chinese food. With that in mind, the food was yummy."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to eat, but since they changed owner's the food is not half as good as it Used to be and the portions are smaller, the prices are higher. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Maybe I came here on an off day because I really do not understand how this place got such rave reviews. Greasy, very bland food.  The vegetables that were in my vegetable fried rice tasted like they came from a bag and had almost no taste.  The prices were decent but definitely not worth it because of the poor quality of the food.  Also, the inside of the restaurant had an unpleasant odor which was terribly off putting. No thanks."}
{"text":"Was at the San Tan mall Friday night and used Yelp to find a non-chain restaurant.  Surprised it was pretty empty with such a favorable rating.  Nice environment and was seated quickly and received good service.   I got the beef broccoli family dinner.  Ordered hot and sour and was served egg drop.  I kept it and enjoyed it...very delicate flavor and not too salty like most.  I wasn't partial to a spice used in the beef broccoli and the spring roll so I would not repeat but it was good.  However, loved my husband's curry chicken dish so he shared with me.  Kinda skimpy on the chicken when you consider how thin it is cut.    My daughter doesn't like sauce on her meat...so they cooked the teriyaki chicken kids meal w/o sauce.  Chicken done perfectly - she LOVED IT.  I think I would prefer lunching here since you don't get a ton of food for the price like other Chinese restaurants, but the flavor is worth repeating."}
{"text":"Straight American Chinese food. Food came in large proportions. Sesame honey chicken isn't overkill like some other restaurants, tolerable.  Unless you like onions (and I I mean LOVE onions) do not get the Mongolian beef. That is one of the worst dish I've ever had... The beef was alright but 90% of the plate was onions. Green onions, white onions... You name it. It should really be called onions and beef. I normally don't mind onions... But blech"}
{"text":"We just moved herefrom NY & decided to try Chen's today based on the really good reviews here on Yelp. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!! Anyone on here who gave this more than one star has no idea what good Chinese food is! The food was horrible & there was a huge language barrier. NEVER AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices and large portions. Is our \"go-to\" place for Chinese food, even though we moved, so it's further away now."}
{"text":"Great little family restaurant!  Very clean, superb service, and the food is very tasty. Not greasy and always hot (temperature). Loved the angel blossoms (crab rangoon). The hot and sour soup had some fire to it, and the fried rice (not greasy) was a meal in itself. We ordered the family dinner and took as much food home as we ate. A very good value."}
{"text":"First,  it smells like sewer or rotten eggs in the place.  This is my first visit so I'm not sure what's going in there.  Also for the quality food,  too expensive.  Sweet n sour pork, dried,  doughy and soggy. Pork fried rice excellent! Green beans and chicken,  weird.  The chicken was almost like mush. General chicken,  was just okay. Not liking the weird dough.   I don't think I'll order again.  Sorry...."}
{"text":"Superb. Any restaurant can have a difficult staff day or a particular dish that wasn't up to par. Having said that, anything less than 5 stars for this place is simply short sighted. Consistently several steps above the other Chinese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"OK, I have been to this restaurant several times in the past 4 years and cannot believe the experience I had tonight. I have only dined in one time. We haven't gone back to dine because it is really bright and overly quiet but we get take-out. The food has always been average, but the wait time on take-out is next to nothing. I went in tonight and ordered the Dragon and Phoenix. On the menu it is states it is stir fry chicken and shrimp with mixed vegetables. IN REALITY it is breaded orange chicken with no shrimp and snow peas. When I got home and called to point out the mistake and ask to come back and get the correct meal I was told that the printer on their menus screwed up and the chef prepared the meal correctly.  When I asked why they wouldn't explain the mistake when the meal is ordered she answered \"like everyone knows what Dragon and Phoenix is\". LOL Apparently not everyone, because I had no idea and assumed I was getting the entree that was listed under the name. I will NEVER go back and what terrible customer service. Drive up one mile to Hong Kong BIstro for better food and better service (I would have gone there but they close at 9)."}
{"text":"The lunch menu is simple and a good value.  Any meal is $7, choose an entre, comes with soup, spring role and choice of rice.    Pros: we all had chicken meals, meat quality and taste were good (some Chinese places have poor quality meats, not Chens).  Our server Jackie had a sharp wit, took good care of us, made us laugh.  Taught us a new trick with the chopstick wrapper.  Cons: no decorations, and music selection a bit too pop for a good Chinese meal.  Overall impression: Chens offers good food at a very good price, but the ambiance could be better.  Sister's View: \"charming and filling.\" Other sister's view: \"I feel like we're in a garage listening to the wrong radio station.\""}
{"text":"This is without doubt, the best lunch I've ever had. And it's extremely cheap for all the food you get!!!"}
{"text":"We went with some friends for lunch. I'm really surprised at the 4 star rating of this Gilbert restaurant. The service was very good and I appreciated it. Our meals came out fast, and our waters were continually filled. Hostess and server were cheerful.  The lunches each came with choice of soup (I chose hot & sour), an egg roll and a cream cheese deep fried wonton. My entree was Hunan beef. My wife had almond chicken and my friends had Teriyaki chicken and Mongolian beef. Now, except for the Teriyaki chicken, I would not expect soy sauce in the dishes. But it was in every dish. Weird. My wife's almond chicken had corn and peas in it for filler vegetables. No, I'm not talking snow peas and baby corn. I'm talking about corn and peas you would get from your freezer or a can. Weird. Oh, yeah, AND zucchini. I had baby corn and snow peas but also celery. I'm always leery of Chinese dishes that have celery in it. That reads: cheap filler. My wife's and my dishes did have water chestnuts in it.  The egg rolls had no meat, they were just cabbage filled. The cream cheese won tons were decent. The soup was, too.  But soy sauce in everything? And cheap veggie fillers?  Naw, sorry, this Asian feels like I wasted my money."}
{"text":"This is the place I go for dishes that I miss. Just like the way my mom does it. Good food for good prices."}
{"text":"We ate here because we were in the area and Yelps good rating. I have no idea why it  is rated 4 stars. This was the worse food I've had in a long time. No flavor and fried rice wasn't fried at all and they swore it was. Good service horrible food."}
{"text":"The good-got Orange chicken dinner and rice noodles. I'm pleased that Chens doesn't fill their dishes with a ton of vegetables.  The meat portions are good. Other places you have to search through to find the meat sometimes. The taste was good. Friendly staff.  Opportunities: dishes indicated spicy but I'd say mild. Throw some of the long hot peppers in and/or offer hot oil with dish. I got the rice noodles because I was craving different noodles than the Singapore noodles. My dish tasted good but it was same taste as Singapore. I suggest a rice noodle dish with distinct difference ie-garlic, soy, oyster sauce.  Friendly staff but a little awkward dining in. As we sat down we were asked \"do you know what you'll order\" maybe they thought we were regulars. We said no and ordered a soda. As soon as she brought soda, she asked again. Only 2 minutes had passed. My dish came about 5 mins before others. Then before we were done eating, we were asked if we wanted boxes. Waitress was polite but maybe inexperienced.  Skip-the hot and sour soup  I'll return. I know the woman told my mom \"if there is something you don't see on menu, just ask and we will make it\". 4 stars."}
{"text":"I work next door and I love this place! They're always so nice and very fast with their food. I highly recommend their spring rolls."}
{"text":"Oh yeah...  Chen's in middle of Gilbert is a treasure.   Would not expect to find good chinese in middle of Gilbert.  Love the General's  Love the Dumplings.  Love the Kung Pao.    They can make it spicy if you like it... I do."}
{"text":"Terrible experience! We walked in, no one ever said hi or greeted us. A man with a scowl led us over to a table. Server came to table. Didn't say hi or smile. Said \"drinks?\" Came back, took our order, didn't smile, acted like we were a burden. Another server came back shortly after and pretty much threw the plates of food on the table, turned around and left. No one asked how anything tasted or if we needed anything else. Everyone was rude, no one smiled, it was uncomfortable and I could live with all that if the food was amazing but sadly it's not even mediocre. Don't dine at Chen's Chinese bistro. The food isn't good and they don't appreciate your business."}
{"text":"Good but a tad expensive.  I only purchased two cartons of fried rice for a party.  Bland and boring."}
{"text":"Amazing local Chinese food!  Had the fried rice and crab Rangoon both were awesome!  Definitely try this for your next dinner!!"}
{"text":"Really excited for a new good Chinese place is now in Gilbert. Close to shopping so I love to grab this on my way home on the weekends. Fast and good service are the top reason I love this place. Food is excellent, and they have always gotten my order correct. Prices are good for the large portions you receive. They do not serve alcohol at this time but the owner, young man who is very personable, told me they are working on a liquor license."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place! And they deliver! Dining in the service is always super fast and the food is always very tasty! We are so happy to have found good Chinese in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Good food, price and service.  The very young hostess was pleasant & quite good at customer service."}
{"text":"I don't know where the good reviews came from, in my opinion the food we ordered wasn't great by any means. The cream cheese puffs had hardly any cream cheese and the Mongolian beef should have just been called Mongolian onions. I definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Where do I start? We have been here many many times. We continue to hold out hope for this place because when the stars align you might get a tasty lunch at a very reasonable price.  The lunches are 6 to 8 dollars with the usual soup/salad and egg roll with it. Portions are small but adequate. Various sauces do well to hide the taste of these fresh from the freezer offerings.  Just 2 miles from Sun Lakes across from the Fry's Market. Come as you are. Teeth are optional."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants! Love the honey chicken and hot and sour soup. Good prices and excellent service!"}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast and this is the only place I go. The food is good, the service and speed is great...can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I love a Chinese Lunch Combo! Especially at $6 the price is right! Unfortunately that's where value ended. Our Honey Sesame Chicken was poorly prepared. The chicken was so mushy I could cut it with my chopsticks.  The Hunan Style Chicken had nice veggies but the chicken was so sparse, and everything seemed very watery.  The Hot & Sour soup was a bit too thick and lacked flavor.   The people were friendly, and kept our drinks full. The rice was nice and sticky. The egg rolls were tasty. And the establishment is nice & clean.   Bottom Line: it's worth trying! See if it suits you. But be prepared to feel like the price to food taste ratio is slightly off. Too many other awesome Chinese Food places in the neighborhood to say we'd be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing the honey walnut shrimp was delicious!  Portions were family sized and the spicy soup was great.  Very clean and quiet."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We love coming to eat our favorite dishes; chicken chow mien and the pork fried rice! Yum!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, large portions, timely delivery of food to the table and friendly workers."}
{"text":"Always delicious food! My go-to is Sweet and Sour Chicken with fried rice. Friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Fairly decent food for a little Chinese restaurant. Very prompt service and the food was hot. Had chow mien with chicken and my daughter had cashew chicken. We both ordered special and they were very accommodating. We got bowls of egg drop on the house and ordered some egg rolls. All the food was good.  The only downside was the waitress's daughter was there...about 2 years old and NO ONE was watching her. She kept interrupting everyone'd dinner and would stand and stare at the diners..including myself and my daughter. It was a bit annoying."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, finally a good Chinese restaurant on the East side! Love the dinner combinations since they come with a excellent egg roll, angel puff, fried shrimp and choice of rice."}
{"text":"Delish! The apple blossoms are different then the typical crab puffs. They are actually kind of sweet tasting. The orange chicken is amazing. Prices are average and they don't deliver. Everyone who works here is very nice."}
{"text":"1st time and went there based on Yelp review of four stars.  Egg fried rice-decent and flavorful Shrimp Kung Pao-ok flavor but too soupy. Don't get me wrong, Kung Pao needs to marinate in its own juices but just had too much like it was a soup.  Now the problem. When i get Chinese food, i always get orange chicken because it is a must and you can't mess it up. I was wrong. The breading was still mushy and gummy. No \"orange sauce\" on it. The worst part that all the Nuggets stuck together and it was just one big mush. No flavor at all. imagine dipping bread in water and then eating it.  It all seemed like the preparation was rushed. It is too bad because i moved to AZ six months ago and i needed a Chinese spot. It was take out and i really wanted to take it back but aint nobody got time for that. To be a 4 star you need to be on point all the time not most of time."}
{"text":"I don't normally comment on a Chinese place but I must say this place is probably the best one I have ever been to. The gals are running like crazy insuring everyone is being served quickly and the food is very good. The steamed rice is perfect and the hot and sour soup is by far the best I have had. Chinese is Chinese but this place is at the top of Chinese."}
{"text":"Good quick Chinese food. Not as cheap as buffets, but that's expected. Super yummy chicken and vegetables."}
{"text":"I love the food at Chen's!  I have been going there since it opened and never have had a bad experience.  My personal favorite is the Sesame Chicken and the fried shrimp.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am reluctant to write this because this is a very unusual style of Chinese cooking. We had the sesame chicken, general tso, angel blosom, egg roll and hot and sour soup, to-go  The chicken for both dishes was just like you could get from Costco box chinese meals.  Sesame chicken did not have any sauce at all on it. There was at most 2 teaspoons of some below it. Some sesame scattered on top. It was nice and crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.  The general tso had some very light sauce coating on the outside of each piece. Decent flavor.  The egg rolls as others have pointed out are barely filled. What is in them is mostly cabbage with a very light flavor. The pork was more of a ground sausage type but not more than a pencil eraser head worth in it.  The angel blossom (cheese wonton if you will) was fairly sweet which is fine. The problem is the filling was in the cracks of each of the four corners and none in the middle itself. The main issue I had with it was each time I took a bite there was this fishy smell to it like it had been fried in grease where only seafood c was fried. I did not find these appealing in any way.  The hot and sour soup was not like any I had had before. It had a unusual flavor I hadn't had before in a hot and sour soup. Not a bad flavor just different. The pork was chewy in it, it had about 5 pieces of medium size shrimp. Was it worth $7 for the quart size, the most I have ever paid in the hundreds of places I have visited to eat, absolutely not.  The prices to me were fairly step for the portion size I feel.  They were extremely nice employees. But if I ask you are your egg rolls like traditional egg rolls or a spring roll for heaven sakes at least know what a spring roll is...  Will I return and try again? No, this will be a first and last visit."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since the day it opened and not only is the food outstanding the service is top notch. Love this place even if doesn't deliver the dining experience is great. Clean well decorated. Feels more expensive than it is."}
{"text":"Not as great as I hoped for. Restaurant was almost empty accept for one other couple. Should have been a red flag. Server had a hard time with English. Food was very hot but very greasy. Mongolian beef was over spicy with a different pepper than any other place making it unappealing to me. Over all a disappointing experience. Nothing too bad but left feeling like it was a bad choice."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the state! The owner is a good guy. Very friendly. The food is always consistent. I hate places where you never know if that day you will get the good chef who makes the food amazing or the lazy chef that just DGAF. No need to worry about that here. That is worth a lot in my book. All I have got here is the Mongolian Beef and the Beef Chow Mein. Both are completely on point. My Chinese food loyalty will always lie here."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing bad to say about this place! Amazing food, amazing service. Our server put all of our leftovers in a box and refills while our glasses were still half full. Ps. Get the Mongolian Beef!!"}
{"text":"The service was great and good size portion of food. The food lacked in flavor.  Maybe add some more hot peppers to it.  If I get a chance I'll try there lunch to see if it has more taste. The people were the friendliest I've ever seen at a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly staff (family owned and operated.)  Make us feel welcome everytime we eat in or get take out."}
{"text":"The food was ok.    But they don't authorize the coupons in full from entertainment.com.   It's an app.   If you don't want to accept or agree to entertainment.com coupons, why become a partner with them?    The lady said next time bring in a paper coupon.   The app says buy one get one free with max discount of $8.  On my bill the 2 dinners of $11 and $8 were on there and two drinks for $4.  That is $23, and with tax $25.    She put $25 and in hand writing I could barely read put \"-$5\".   But didn't give me the $5 which isn't even the coupon.   I didn't argue, I just paid and added $5 tip because the place was empty and I felt a little sorry for them.   But I am never going back again.   It is false advertising to agree with Entertainment.com for a coupon if a customer pays the $50 annual fee o be a member and then not give the discount.   She saved $8 but lost a customer for life"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last week. Quiet place, friendly service the hot and sour soup was great! Chow main was my favorite. We tried 6 different dishes none were disappointing."}
{"text":"Stopped here at 12:30pm. There were only about 3 other tables taken up. It was a very clean restaurant. I was promptly greeted and shown a table.  I loved the wonton chips and sweet and sour sauce was the perfect Asian 'chips and salsa'. The egg drop soup was very hearty. I had honey chicken and it was so fresh and hot! The brown rice was room temperature and the egg roll was very hot as well. The waitress was working her tail off, attending to the customers in a timely manner. I will be back, and bring others. My lunch special was $7!! You cant eat at McDonalds for that price!"}
{"text":"I was glad I found this place and decided to try it. The service was excellent from beginning to end. The food came out and seemed fresh and was very good. The shrimp that came with my dinner was really good and I would have licked my plate if my wife wasn't with me."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this little locally-owned place. The people were friendly & fast. The menu had good options & was easy to navigate. The food, however, was less than impressive."}
{"text":"Favorite lunch Chinese place! Food is fantastic and you get an entree, rice, cream puff, and spring roll with soup for 7$!! Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials! $6 for chicken, beef or pork and $7 for shrimp. Comes with soup, egg roll and angel blossom."}
{"text":"Love this place! Not only is the staff extremely friendly and accommodating but the food is delicious and decently priced. I usually get the combination plates because you get a little bit of everything. Angel Blossoms are on point and so are the egg rolls, spring rolls and hot and sour soup! The food isn't greasy like the usual Chinese food and I have tried many things on the menu. Me and my family went on a Friday night and they were very busy but I still managed to get my food and drinks in a timely manner. If you like your food a specific way then TELL THEM and they will comply. I come here at least once a month to get my Chinese food fix."}
{"text":"Now Wei Wok, new mgmt same great food.  Best orange chicken I've ever tasted and excellent service"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have had since I left Chicago 3 years back! I eat there at least twice a week and Vic and company are great when it comes to preparing your dish to your liking.    I'm hard to please and I leave there happy each and every time, I always have leftovers and the food has great flavor."}
{"text":"Been here 5 separate times and never an issue,  it's absolutely perfect :) the food is amazing,  the staff is friendly,  and everything is absolutely spotless."}
{"text":"I had two of the largest strips of what was supposed to be beef in the beef & broccoli dish and both were pure fat, no meat whatsoever.  The pieces were about 1.25 inches wide by a good 4\" long.  The brown sauce was blah - not worth eating.  Another eater found it edible but, that was it. The fried thing that was supposed to be a cheese puff - was tasteless, pretty bad.  Didn't even taste like cheese.  The egg roll was very greasy, although tasty but, it seemed like there wasn't much filling, probably because it was so greasy, because it was plump.  No, I would not go back there."}
{"text":"Visited Chen's today for the first time.  Great food at a great price and very friendly service."}
{"text":"When you find a good Chinese food place, you hang onto it for dear life.  When you find two, it's bordering on miraculous.  One thing that many folks who visit Chen's for the first time is that they are New Yorkers which means the Chinese food is going to have a different flavor, style and consistency.    The multitude of times that my wife and I have been there, we have been pleased with both the food and the service.  We always order the Egg Drop Soup which actually has a nice flavor and is pretty balanced.  The PuPu Platter is also quite tasty.  My wife has to sometimes fight me for the shrimp because it's so good that I am liable to eat hers and mine.    The entrees that we have had never left a bad taste in our mouths at all.  Everything we have eaten has been on point, consistent in quality, served promptly, and definitely reasonably priced.    The venue itself is more pleasing and relaxing than the Waldo's it replaced.  Also, the staff (including the owner) are quite friendly to us and know my wife and me when we walk in.  We are permanent customers."}
{"text":"Very delicious food and amazing service! I come here on my lunch break sometimes and it's really authentic! The honey chicken is definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"What a nice quiet little Chinese restaurant nestled in a huge shopping center!! The restaurant is small and quiet and the wait staff is very friendly and quick. Four TVs in the dining room make it perfect for a football Sunday quick lunch.   I ordered the dinner combination and for only $11 dollars you get rice, fried shrimp, egg roll and soup in addition to your meat choice! The food came out nice a hot and fresh. The general chicken was delicious.   My husband ordered honey sesame chicken and it was also top notch.   My only recommendation is serving more rice with the combo!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food and Service. Everyone is so nice here. They have a chicken noodle soup with nice big vegetables that is delicious. If your eating in or taking out or even delivery you know your going to get a good meal and fast service. I highly recommend Chen's Chinese Bistro"}
{"text":"Menu prices are reasonable for lunch and dinner.  Can only comment on the Beef Chow Fun which I had which was good and a generous portion.  A good addition to the East Valley."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, and fabulous service, this is our family's go-to place for really good Chinese food. This is the first time in this part of the valley, that I feel like we've had decent restaurant Chinese food. When we went, there was no odd smells, but maybe there was an issue back in the spring that was resolved by the time we went. Over all, the atmosphere was quiet and cozy, the food was served fast and piping hot, and the quality was very good."}
{"text":"Had door dash deliver. Lo mein combination. Sauce had odd taste, and meat might have been almost spoiled. Won't order again. Plus, i Hate Chinese resturants that don't use the white paper take out boxes."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the service is always very fast and hot. The waiters are great at refills, too. It's a nice little stop when you are craving Chinese and don't want the wait."}
{"text":"I really liked the simple menu.  I didn't feel overwhelmed with choices.  When I first arrived, it was packed.  They asked if we would be ok sharing a large table with another family.  Our daughter is very friendly and I didn't want to disturb the other family so we declined.  Eventually we got a table and at first everything was fine.  Slowly the service declined.  The food wasn't great, just ok.  On a bright note, they serve large portions so there was plenty left over.  Food is a good value.  Lastly, I thought it was odd that they had a vacant baby carrier taking up a whole booth yet they had customers waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"This is seriously one of my FAVORITE places to get Chinese food from!  It is always fresh tasting and the prices are extremely fair for the amount of food that comes in each order.  I have been to Chinese places where the food is soggy or just not even warm when I get it (super disappointing).. But I have never had this issue here!  I've ordered many times now, and I have yet to have a bad experience.  Also, the customer service is awesome.  They always make you feel very welcomed and valued as a customer.  I happen to work in the San Tan Mall, so it's convenient when I want to grab dinner on the way home and that is just an added bonus!  Definitely must check it out for yourself if you're craving REALLY GOOD Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and both times have been good. Not gormet, but better than your average Chinese restaurant in Chandler. Meat is tender and the hot and sour soup is really good. Lemon chicken is good too. If you go for lunch it is a great deal."}
{"text":"Not too shabby! It's a real Chinese spot but it's not a hole in the wall. It's actually kind of nice to not be scared to use their utensils!! Hahaha their food is a little bland, but nothing a little chili sauce can't fix!"}
{"text":"The food was good, just a bit pricy. The website doesn't offer any descriptions of dishes that I had never heard of. I had to call to ask what the coconut shred was then, call back to order after planning my order. I asked for one veggie egg roll and one pork egg rol to try them both but was told they only offered them in pairs so I couldn't split them up. And as it turns out the veggie egg rolls are actually spring rolls (which I'm not a fan of) so I got something that I didn't like and didn't have a pork egg roll to fall back on. The angel blossoms were good (Panda Express caliber not great not bad...just eh). The salt and pepper shrimp was tasty and cooked well. The vegetables that came with it were steamed well. The rice noodle was tasty and cooked well. I had it with combo meats and would recommend it if you plan to eat there. Overall the price doesn't make the food taste any better and could get the same quality from a place closer to home and cheaper. Factor this into your decision if you're going to drive to eat here. Nothing really inventive on the menu, that would make me think \"bistro\" prices or quality. Good food at bad prices. Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"WOW. Was going to call in and order for pick up. I wanted to order off the lunch menu because I saw the reviews and it looked very good for a great value.  I was on my way driving there and called to place the order and the lady who picked up was extremely rude.  I asked if the lunch menu was still going on she said \"three.\"  I said OK can I please place an order for pick up and she said \"what do you want\" in such a rude irritated tone. I then asked does the lunch menu come with soup? (I looked on the website and it says it does. I just wanted to verify.). She told me \"No.\" I was like OK well what does it come with then? And she was sooooo rude and started getting loud with me saying \"you tell me what you want OK.\" I was so confused and honestly a bit offended by how rude she was being to me such a lack of customer service. I was at the point of hanging up but I told her I want fried rice and...  she starts speaking over me in a loud tone. At this point I said OK I'm going to hang up and go eat somewhere else because you're being extremely disrespectful to me. I hung up and that was it. I honestly can't believe the experience I just had based on the great reviews I am honestly disappointed as this is what I wanted for lunch."}
{"text":"I like the food here and the hot tea and the egg rolls. I like that I can substitute for tofu. Love the Honey Walnut Tofu. The place could be cleaner and the waitress a little more enthusiastic, just a little."}
{"text":"I went to this establishment last Tuesday with my friend, and we both agreed that it is the best Americanized Chinese restaurant that we have ever been to. I chose the Beef and Broccoli  and I am very happy I chose this entrée. The employees are very friendly and we had unbelievable service, we were seated as soon as we walked in the door.    The beef tasted like it was marinated overnight if not, longer. The seasoning was very adventurous and had my mouth watering bite after bite. The beef was slow cooked to a great medium-rare, and every piece was very tender and juicy. The broccoli was steamed to perfection with a slight crunch. The whole dish was smothered in a brown, warm teriyaki sauce. The dish was presented with a high degree of professionalism and looked like it came from a five star restaurant.  The environment is very family friendly and is culturally inclined. When you walk into the restaurant, you see extravagant Chinese elements all around. There was Chinese writing in small frames that represented the five senses of human nature. Instead of typical lighting, there were Chinese lanterns hanging from the ceiling. Each menu item was written in Chinese with English translations. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are searching for great food, impeccable service and Chinese culture."}
{"text":"Not to be confused with the nearby and completely unrelated Chen's Chinese Restaurant  It's your typical American Chinese done pretty darn well. All your standby fried breaded chicken dishes are here, but they're surprisingly light and crispy instead of heavy and soggy. Everything else you'd expect to see is also here, and generally tastes pretty darn good.   Nothing on the menu makes me want to stand up and scream \"wow,\" but it's solid Chinese, it's within spitting distance of my grandfather's retirement community, and the staff are always friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"The place was very busy for takeout and half of the tables were full so we thought it was a good sign. Service was great. The egg Rolls were OK- nothing special and the honey sesame chicken was heavy on the batter and honey- not great. The Mongolian beef was good and the fried rice was OK. Still looking for a really good Chinese restaurant in Chandler."}
{"text":"Got this for take out and was really impressed!  The woman who took my order was fast and friendly both on the phone and in the restaurant.  Restaurant was clean and food was ready to go when I got there.  She was so fast taking my order, I honestly expected something to be wrong, but it was exactly as requested.  Food was delicious and portions were generous."}
{"text":"Great little Chinese place!  The lunch special price cannot be beat and the food was flavorful."}
{"text":"It does smell like sewer .... BUT everything is amazing. The employees are super nice and welcoming. The orange chicken is the best I've had in a while. Perfectly seasoned and juicy. The shrimp fried rice lacked season but nothing some soy sauce didn't fix. I would come back."}
{"text":"I have been craving Chinese food all week and decided to stop at Chen's on my way home for take-out. I ordered the Curry Chicken which was delicious. Great yellow curry flavor, a little spicy with tender pieces of chicken. Not the usual yellow curry with potatoes but very good nevertheless. I also ordered Shrimp with Vegetables and it was Very Good. Large shrimp (and a lot of them) with perfectly cooked vegetables and a nice white sauce. The staff are very nice and always ask if I'd like water while I wait. The wait is never long and the food is very hot. Good prices for the quantity and quality- both of my dishes were around $24 and I had enough left over for 3 lunches. I like to patronize local businesses and I hope they have a long and successful future. Would recommend any shrimp dish- they do a great job with them."}
{"text":"Fresh and well prepared food which is very good.  Delighted to find this quality Chinese Bistro.  I'll be back many times."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese places in Arizona by far. Independent from the other Chen's, this one seems to focus on the eating experience. Decor and customer service is a A+ in my book!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is maybe the second best Chinese restaurant I've been to. The food was very tasty it was freshly made came out piping hot and I love the family-style dining. The reason I didn't give a five star there had probably been two other people in the restaurant eating and it really seem like a long time for our food to come out. My son has actually asked to go back so I know the vote was good. I highly recommend paying the bistro a little visit. It will be worth it. Oh they deliver too"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! Great service, nice deco and everything tasted wonderful! Best Chinese food I have had in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Our family loves this place.  Best Chinese food in the SE Valley in our opinion.  The owners are always super friendly and the food is delicious every time we are here, whether take-out or dine-in.  Great portions.  Very clean."}
{"text":"Typical Americanized Hong Kong style chop shey house with sauces that tends to be very light and fresh.   Great place for health conscious crowd since the food will tend to be little under seasoned for my taste.  Friendly services from the owners.   Lemon chicken was nice and crisp which was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Great local Chinese restaurant that is family owned. Great food that is reasonable priced. It's right down the street from where I live."}
{"text":"The food is generic american Chinese but everyone needs one of these for cheap good food and this is my new go to!   Always love their lunch specials but I decided to try something different. You can never go wrong with chow fun. The greasy noodles just hits a spot in your belly no other food can. I love the beef with it!   My belly and wallet are happy. Thanks"}
{"text":"I am quickly coming to the conclusion that Chinese food in the valley will merely be an exercise in mediocrity.  Oddly enough, the last time I had what one would call truly unique Chinese food was when i was in North Pole (not \"the North Pole\") Alaska.  It's in the middle of nowhere, but it's some of the best Chinese food I've had in years.  But back to Chen's.  Food was ok.  Mediocre but edible.   I'm not sure this is a review of Chen's so much as it's a commentary on the sad state of Chinese food here in the valley."}
