{"text":"I've been coming here for a few months and the hookah has smoked amazing every time: great flavor and smooth.  I've tried three other places in Pitt and they don't compare. Combine this with great prices, great music, plenty of comfortable 'couchy' seating, excellent service, amiable staff and some great local places to eat (the Indian buffet across the street is great!) and you have a winning combination.  Highly recommended."}

{"text":"I am not likely to write yelp reviews unless it's super great or super horrid. That being said, This is by far the best hookah that I have tried in Pittsburgh! We have been to many hookah places and none compare. The entire time the smoke is smooth and super flavorful. The owner is always very nice and friendly. Highly recommend it."}

{"text":"Fun music, comfortable seating (perfect for going by yourself, with just a friend, or even for larger groups), hookah was nice & smooth, and there's a good tea selection. The owner was very friendly and welcoming. Definitely my favourite hookah spot in Oakland with a chill ambience and great vibes!"}

{"text":"This place has great hookah, great places to relax, and a fantastic atmosphere but that's not why you come. You come for the amazing owners. They become great friends if you just have a simple conversation to them. You come back because this place is a great place to hang out even if you don't want to smoke. I highly recommend coming to this place if you have any time and want to make the best of it."}
{"text":"Great place. Owners are incredibly kind and personable. They have a ps4 if you're into that. And overall good vibes.   Btw Watermelon and mint is a good combination."}
