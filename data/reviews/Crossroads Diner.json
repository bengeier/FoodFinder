{"text":"Really good food, but really a little expensive for what it is you get. Servings are average and in some cases even small. I love the food but I love getting my money's worth as well. Sorry but I just feel I get shorted in the portion dept."}
{"text":"Great food! Reasonable prices and friendly staff. Grilled pork chops are very good! Wings are great to! Club wrap is good!"}
{"text":"First time there and didn't expect much but boy was I wrong. Great food! Great service! Very reasonable prices. If your in the area for a very satisfying meal I would say don't pass it by. Take a chance!"}
{"text":"Very bad fly problem!  Pretty bad you have to swat at the files to enjoy your meal. Chicken livers not very good."}
{"text":"We have been stopping here on the way to the beach for years, clean, friendly and reasonable prices. They have the best Chicken Ciabatta sandwich...You won't be sorry you stopped.."}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price.  Friendly service.  We had the Country Fried Steak, Hamburger Steak, and the Cheeseburger.  All were cooked properly and came out quickly.  The place was busy but the staff was on top of it.  We will be stopping here on beach trips going forward."}
{"text":"Had the best time. My daughter had her favorite restaurant in mind.. Was awesome.. Great food.  Plus they went the extra mile to make her 25th Birthday and new baby coming even better. Love the owner. He is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Very consistent good food! We have eaten breakfast, lunch and dinner here several times and have never been disappointed. I wood recommend for any meal and try the fried cheese cake!!! Awesome dessert! Staff are friendly and will recognize you if you visit often as we have. All of this gives you a small town atmosphere"}
{"text":"I am working out of town and actually contrary to belief eat out of my cubicle most of the time, not gettign to go out and eat exotic and wonderful meals. But on occasion I make the time to stop for a real meal. I stopped here on my way home after passing it each week on the three hour commute.   It's a typical diner, on the interior, with formica tables and simple decorations.   Service was friendly and fast, I am sure I was the only non local in there. I ordered the fried pickles and got a basket large enough to feed an army. They were delish but my eyes were bigger than my stomach. For dinner I had the chicken steak sandwich and squash patty. The sandwich was good, lot's of chicken onions and cheese. Not greasy and an ample portion. The Fried squash patty WAS divine. It was kind of like a german potato cake with squash , not at all greasy, delicate , stuck together well , and flavored just right. I wished I had gotten the veggie plate and ordered three of them!   Great fast, comfort food, with wide selection for a diner. Friendly, clean and tasty it made the drive home much faster and happier , as I had not eaten all day!"}
{"text":"Great little country spot.  Breakfast is by far the best meal that they serve.  The pork jobs are delicious and the collards and stewed apples make a great side.  Definitely a good spot off of the beaten path!!"}
{"text":"Good food! Take out is faster than eating in, not sure why... That being said, if you decide to eat in, take a seat where you like.   I've always gotten the veggie plate. Mac and cheese is very good, green beans are delicious, fried okra is fresh, and you gotta try the corn tots! Potato salad is average-too smooth and not a fan of pickles. The stewed apples were very tasty. My dad got the brisket, so tender it was falling apart.  Prices are good and you get a lot of food. Food is usually made to order and very hot when it comes out. The ladies are nice, but not overly so.   I will return again, already been dozens of times."}
{"text":"Good little country diner.  Home cooked meals, friendly service and always ha a high inspection rating.  Where the locals eat."}
{"text":"Visited this little diner for breakfast with my nephew. It was local and convenient to his house.  When we walked in, we were told to sit anywhere we liked.   The waitress was quick to take our drink orders and returned with them quickly. The staff was very attentive in making sure our drinks were topped off.  I ordered a pancake w bacon. It was good and hot when I got it. My nephew ordered the omelet, grits and toast. He mentioned the omelet could have had more meat, but he enjoyed it.   Overall, the staff was friendly, food was hot and inexpensive. The decor was country and suited the location. If your in the area, stop here for a simple breakfast!"}
{"text":"We've been eating here for years. The food is good, the staff has always been friendly and prices are reasonable. They make really good honey mustard for your sandwiches, wraps or fries. We usually just get ours to go but when we do eat it the service is always good."}
{"text":"This place is you get what you pay for.  I think most of the people that eat there are locals to the area and so we caught some looks when we walked in the door.  The menu is of a wide variety and the prices are decent.  Our food took some time to come out and when it did arrive it was just ok.  Our waitress was definitely not overly friendly but was kind enough to see that we didn't really enjoy the meal and then told us that our meal was no charge.  I don't think that we will visit there again but I also didn't get the impression that what happen to us was normal."}
{"text":"When my significant other and I moved down the road from the diner a year and a half ago we visited frequently. In fact, we were greeted as Saturday morning regulars and often brought family and friends. Unfortunately, the last time we ordered take away we sat up front for 20 minutes before they realized our food had been sitting up there all along. We were willing to give them another chance and they next time we ordered take away the SAME THING happened. We waited 15-20 minutes only to find out \"oops it's been here this whole time\"...when we got home the fries and food were soggy and cold. We've also noticed a significant increase in their pricing and pay $20-30 for a two person lunch without drinks-ouch! A few weeks have gone by and I called today to place a pick up order...with high hopes that there's no way something could go wrong again. When I asked my options for sides I was told \"all of the sides are available\"...still upset and unresolved from the last two orders I decided to hang up and wipe my hands of this place. We will not be returning due to the steep decline in customer service and incline in pricing."}
{"text":"Solid local country diner with good food! Can't go wrong with a good home cooked meal, good service, and the restaurant being exceptionally clean. Some of these down home country places let the tidiness go, but definitely not here. Kudos to that! Important to note also that they do accept credit cards. We will definitely be back here, but next time before 11 so we can try breakfast!"}
