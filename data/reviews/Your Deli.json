{"text":"Great deli in Amherst.  We go there often for lunch and they are always friendly and offer fast service.  They have a wide variety sandwiches available with several types of breads offered.  They are known for their Paprikash which is one of the best ones I've had from a restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been going to Your Deli for over 25 years and Deb has always run a great restaurant. The sandwiches are fresh and there's a great selection of them. 
And anyone who has a problem with the Paprikash hasn't sampled as many as I. I have to admit Debs is better than my moms.  (Well, that's a relief, no lightning strikes). And let me say that's saying something. 
I wish Your Deli all the success in the world and I know they'll get it for the outstanding products and services they provide."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me this long to discover Your Deli! I have been depriving myself for years and I didn't even know it! It's always packed, and the four times (in the past 2 1/2 weeks) that I've been here, I've gotten delicious, quality food. You can watch the paprikas being made as you sit in the dining area and eat. There are many sandwich options to choose from at the deli area, but I always go with the grilled cheese and cup of chicken paprikas. It is absolutely mouth-watering. You are definitely paying for fresh, high quality food when you visit Your Deli. I can even take my picky eater son, as they do make kids meals (pbj for my guy). This is my new favorite lunch spot!"}
{"text":"The roast beef on rye sandwich was horrific,  the rye bread was dry and falling apart in my hand. The chicken pop was bland. Then I looked at the diners and they had silver hair (which explains the no flavor, no salt food) Overpriced as well, I couldn't eat there on a fixed income."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant.  Super fast, friendly service.  Great food.  Paprikash is awesome.  I highly recommend it!  

Debbie, the owner, must be doing well since she's only open from 10:30 am to 3:30 pm Monday through Friday.  I know she sells her Paprikash in stores and does catering too.  She could REALLY make a fortune if the restaurant was open longer."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are decent enough they get 3 stara, but the chicken paprikash gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"They are known for their Chicken Paprikash.  It was pretty good, not the best ever, but def good. I would eat it again.  Their Ruben sandwich was a delightful but basic version.  The service was great, fast, and friendly.  Great little spot if you are in the area.

Their Chicken Paprikash is not as good as Tony Packo's in Toledo!  Just an FYI."}
{"text":"If your in amherst ohio and are looking for the best sandwhich in town THIS IS IT !!! Owner Operated By Debbie,Greg & Zach Dixon !! SERVICE REFLECTS THAT Killer food and service !!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are pretty average.  Chicken Paprikash is pretty good."}
{"text":"The lunch today was very tasty.  I was told I had to have the chicken paprikash.   Sure enough it was very good.  I ordered the combo.  Half sandwich with cup of paprikash and a soda.  The sandwich was chicken salad sandwich.  It also tasted pretty good.  Very good lunch."}
{"text":"Great chicken paprikash, good sandwiches. A little mom & pop type place that is good for a casual lunch or dinner."}
