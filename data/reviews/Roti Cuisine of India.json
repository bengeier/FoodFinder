{"text":"I love love love this place! They make the best chana roti in Toronto! Never go anywhere else, small place and boring music but they make the meanest indian food in town. Definitely recommend! :)"}
{"text":"amazing place, great for take-out (the actual dining area is VERY hot) had the lamb jalfrezi and my friends had the butter chicken, huge delicious portions they are well-priced. I ordered mine medium spicy (7 out of 10) and didn't fit it very spicy at all so I would suggest ordering up a spice level from what you are used to at other indian restaurants."}
{"text":"We were a little confused by the interior... they seem to be a take-out place with juuust enough space to accommodate a few tables.  I imagine the restaurant is a hit with the local students, and orders seem to fly out the kitchen constantly for pick-up.  We sat down inside for a try, and our waiter was friendly and attentive (hard not to be, with the lack of space).  We had simple drinks and basic utensils.  The samosa appetizers were good, albeit a little dry.  I asked for the hot level of spicy for my roti, and the waiter warned me.  I got the medium.  I should have got mild.    Our rotis were good, and VERY spicy.  I love spicy food, but this was insane.  Still, it made up for the lack of texture, and tasted pretty good fresh out of the kitchen.  Leftovers were surprisingly edible the next day.  In the end, i would say its a great place to eat after a night on the town, or if you want a cheap option that has some kick to it."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap, fast & friendly. I usually call ahead for take out and the food is ready within 10 minutes. They also have a dine in area which is cool and comfy. I highly recommend the saag paneer and lamb saag roti. If you like very spicy food, try the medium to start."}
{"text":"The best roti hands down.  SO DAMN GOOD!  I wished they had delivery or something closer to my house in Riverdale."}
{"text":"I was walking on Dupont in July and saw that this new Indian Roti place had opened up. I was thrilled because you can never have too much Roti!  The Rotis are authentic and made fresh and delicious. There is a whole range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian rotis starting at $6.99 and they are a good size.  You can choose how spicy you like it but since it is authentic it gets hot fast!  My current favorite Indian roti is Ghandi on Queen St. But this is a very close second. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"large, cheap, delicious.  I recommend the butter chicken roti.  Soooo good"}
{"text":"I noticed that this place uses a lot of fillers in their food.  The price is quite high for the amount of meat that is included."}
{"text":"Was exploring this area of the city and came across this hidden gem! These guys were mostly busy with takeout orders , it's a small place and the \"atmosphere\" is not the greatest for eating in to be honest but all of that become unimportant when you have a first bite of the delicious roti! I had Palak paneer (with spinach) and it was so so good, $10 , ate half as it was pretty filling. Will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeaway from Roti Cuisine of India after coming across the restaurant's name online and knew I would be in that area this evening.  SO good!  We had the mutter paneer roti and an order of vegetable samosa with mango chutney. So delicious. Large portion sizes and the amount of paneer was awesome. The place was full of people picking up orders. We called in our order and it was ready in less than 15 minutes on a Friday evening.   We will definitely be eating from here again."}
{"text":"I live nearby, and get take out rotis all the time. They're good, and they make them quickly,   $13 for the amount of food shown below isn't exactly cheap though (not really expensive either)  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/epb_jKqFvo34MoozEM3Qsg?select=wtZ_L8aTedpLd-IZBYTQJg#wtZ_L8aTedpLd-IZBYTQJg"}
{"text":"Originally, we wanted to get delivery from this place but unfortunately, they do takeout only. A few minutes after placing our order on the phone, it started to drizzle outside and we decided to try to cancel our order. We called the restaurant back but they told us that it wouldn't be possible. We decided the brave the rain anyways (it actually turned into a severe thunderstorm warning midway). About 15min later, while we were drenched trying to make our way to the restaurant, they called us back and told us it was okay to cancel our order...   By then, we were already half way there and soaked to the bone so we told them we still wanted the order. We got to the restaurant around 25min after placing the order and decided to just eat there to avoid the rain. Despite initially having placed the order via phone, we still had to wait for our order to be finished.   We ordered the butter chicken curry - which was amazing! It was around $14 with tax, but the portion was very generous and enough for two. The butter chicken is very creamy but not 'heavy'. I really liked how the butter chicken was wrapped in the roti-kind of like a burrito.   The food was amazing and I'll definitely go there again. I had to minus one star though due to the takeout issues."}
{"text":"After visiting Casa Loma, we came here for a late lunch.  Definitely hit the spot. The roti I had was so delicious."}
{"text":"I cannot go more than two months without ordering the butter chicken roti from RCOI. The portions are massive and flavour is amazing! Stop in and place your takeout order and enjoy a King Fisher beer while you wait. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am on an Indian kick. I love Indian food. I may not know how to pronounce what I am eating, but who cares?  Cue Roti Cuisine. I walked by this place in January without even giving a second glance. How young and misguided I was. I returned there today after a massage next door and was delighted that there was fast & friendly takeout service. A simple menu and a decent price.   I ordered a butter chicken roti and was delighted when not only did I receive a large amount of food, but, the roti was PLAIN. (I had momentarily confused the server by asking if they used paratha or dhal puri roti, but as it turns out there are no chickpeas in sight of this roti!) The butter chicken was pretty good, a nice amount of spice (ordered \"mild\") and balanced with potato. A different preparation than I expected, but every place should make things a little different. A nice addition was the small container of kheer that came with it.  All in all I was satisfied, and am happy to come back again to this prime (and beautiful) Annex location."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, it's nothing to look at, but I ordered take-out here and was very pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Not only is there a very large choice of what to get, they are super quick! The veggie samosas - fresh and delicious. Had a few rotis here and they are all tender, perfectly cooked and spiced to how you like it.   You may heavily smell of India if you chose to dine in but that's part of the great experience. Total hole is the wall kind of place but don't be fooled because places like that usually churn out culinary amaziness.   They only accept cash or debit."}
{"text":"What can I say, I am OBSESSED with this place. I come here atleast once every two weeks. It is very spicy and everything I try is fresh and tasty. My fave is the chicken biryani. Some of the reviewers are complaining about interiors. But really who cares, the place is clean and so what if it doesnt have the latest bells and whistles."}
{"text":"Great tasting rotis at an acceptable price, around $13 each. You can choose how spicy you want your food, and it comes quick."}
{"text":"Best take out, leftovers are delicious and always plenty. We love it! Tried nearly everything on the menu, everything is like magic."}
{"text":"My bf and I went here for first time. Food is very delicious ! Had curry chicken on rice and Chana curry on rice. The server will ask if you want it mild, medium or hot. We had it hot & it was just to our liking (we love spicy food).   The food was Served hot and on a timely manner. Had nice Indian music .. It is alittle snug inside but it doesn't matter, food was very tasty ! We recommend it ... !!!"}
{"text":"A go to take out place in the neighbourhood.   One butter chicken roti is enough for two people to split. The problem is, you know you should stop eating, but you can't put your fork down and end up downing the entire thing.  It may not be as popular as a restaurant like Mother India and the rotis might not live up to the high standard that MI has set.   The food is still delicious and it's likely the best East Indian roti north of Bloor."}
{"text":"Came here with my dad and he was crazy about it, but it was his first roti experience. Overall the texture wasn't bad, and it was definitely not soaked, but it could have been spicier. The medium spice I requested was kind of just mildly spicy, but I'll forgive them because they gave me so much chicken in the roti. They're definitely filling. For someone who's 5'5 and sedentary I think one roti can be two meals. I don't remember what else I had here. Maybe the chickpea roti? I felt pressure to order right away, but the owner let me have a minute.  I would take my friends here but I really gotta admit gandhi roti is better--maybe saltier or a better combo of spices. No two roti are the same though."}
{"text":"Roti portions are enormous! Roti bread is crisp and fresh while the fillings are very rich. I strongly recommend sharing different rotis among a group to balance between the richness of one and spiciness of another. One roti is enough for 2-3 people unless you are trying to consume a days worth of calories in one sitting. I had the chicken saag roti extra spicy and my boyfriend had the butter chicken medium spicy. No complaints although I wish they would make the rotis smaller so you could sample through them. I kept picking at my boyfriends butter chicken when I got bored of eating my saag. All in all this is a great place to order from if you want to really fill your stomach."}
{"text":"This is an awesome take out place. Roti keeps very well for take out. My vegetarian daughter loves their saag paneer roti and I cannot get enough of their curry lamb roti. They do not skimp on the paneer or meat. In fact, I would not mind if they filled their roti with some more potatoes but there's always lots of meat. The meat is cooked just right. Never tough or falling apart at the touch of your fork.  Our latest discovery is their chilli gobi. This is deep fried battered cauliflower with a super tasty sweet, spicy and tangy sauce. This is actually spicy. It's a small portion and  super awesome so I recommend one portion per person. Their roti is big enough for two meals. I do not recommend splitting one of them amongst two people though. You will regret it as soon as you have room for more."}
{"text":"I pretty much eat here once a week. Its easy to pick up, inexpensive and filling (very filling). I've tried a number of different roti's-butter chicken, chicken curry, mutter paneer..but my favourite is the chicken korma. Its just so good and I find myself craving it all the time! I usually grab it for take-out but you can dine in as well. I am not a roti expert but roti cuisine of india can make a good roti."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Portions are huge. Incredible value. I have never had food that I did not like here.  Lamb roti and the potato-eggplant are to die for, but the chunks of chicken in their chicken roti are a little bit dry (still pretty good though!) You never know how spicy it is going to be. I always order mild and some days it can be very spicy!!"}
{"text":"Love this - went there this past weekend with my friend as we were walking by to Shoppers.. Decided to check it out since it's so close to my house.  Walked in, ordered Lamb Biryani and Butter Chicken on Rice - delicious!!  Definitely will be trying the rotis there next. I am so glad to have found a cheap roti place near my house!  Also, EXCELLENT service. The guy is super nice. I went to some other fancy expensive Indian place in Yorkville last month (called The Host) and their service was THE WORST, so a nice change and great to see that these guys put in the effort in service even if their customers don't pay ridiculous prices."}
{"text":"Been passing by this place for a year wondering how the food is. And finally, today I stepped in and got a butter chicken roti - under $13 icluding tax.  Holy Roti! It's freakin' Awesome! I wish I ordered two!  The space is small, few chairs and tables, needs a bit of an update - It's more of a take away place. Service with a smile and they're quick. Cash and debit only.  Kicking myself for ignoring this place for a year and I live so close. I am definitely coming back... Maybe tomorrow ;)"}
{"text":"I want to eat here every day of my life. I'm so glad they don't deliver otherwise I probably would. The butter chicken roti and roasted eggplant/potato roti are my faves."}
{"text":"The chicken/lamb vindaloo is my favourite dish from here. With the consistent chunks of meat and the tingling spiciness in every bite, this is my go-to whenever I crave for Indian food.  I've always bought take-out from here. Even during the harsh winters at negative temperatures and an hour long bus ride, the roti was still steaming hot when I reached home!  I eat massive amounts of food but a whole roti coupled with rice makes it a very satisfying meal.  A terrific place to feed your spicy palate regardless of your meaty or vegetarian preference.  P.S. they offer mild to hot degree of spiciness"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place. My bf and I go all the time and have gotten numerous friends hooked. I've tried sooo much roti in Toronto and this takes the cake no question at all. You NEED to try the chicken korma roti - but be warned, you will become quickly addicted."}
{"text":"I don't usually go for Indian food because their food is usually preeeetty spicy and so all I can really happily eat is the butter chicken + whatever side they give you. I can handle spicy but not suuuuper duuuper spicy.  I was referred here by one of my friends who frequents this place. I had to give it a shot and change things up! It's a small restaurant with maybe about 6-7 tables. I came here for lunch so since my go-to was butter chicken, I got the butter chicken roti with vegetable samosas for the appetizer. I was pretty hungry and thought that at the very least, butter chicken was a safe choice as I think it is hard to screw up such a popular item.  The butter chicken roti was awesome! Very flavourful and I got to choose the level of spicyness too! I found a lot of other Indian shops I've been to didn't give you that option. I chose mild and it was perfect! Not too spicy but not too bland either :) the roti was crispy but soft and soooo yummy! I actually got full from eating 3/4s of it but I just finished it all because I couldn't stop myself! I kept wanting more!  The samosas were pretty good too just a bit hard on the outside but that's about it.  I actually came back later that day for dinner and had the lamb biryani mild spicy. That was just as tasty but I packed part of it home as I could not finish it. When I had the samosas and biryani the next day I was impressed!!! Most food doesn't taste good after a day old but both tasted just like the day before and even if you heated it up REAAAAL good, it didn't get dry or hard at all! This was awesome! I definitely will go back to try some other plates and I suggest others to visit this place too if you are feeling for some good Indian food!!"}
{"text":"I recently discovered this place while searching for indian food in the area online. I wasn't much of a roti person but I'm converted! :D The portions are generous and simply delicious. You've got to be specific on how spicy you want it though it can get very spicy. The decor may not be great but the food more than makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Indian roti places in town. Looks totally unassuming from the outside, but the smell will pull you in and the food is as good as it smells. The vegetarian and meat rotis are excellent, though the texture of the chicken in some rotis is a bit tough. The flavour is excellent, and they really mean it when they call their food spicy. The chilli gobi side order is also terrific- it's sweet and tangy, but is also well flavoured.  Their take-out is efficient and reasonably priced, though certainly not cheap. The portions are very big, so one roti should easily feed at least one person."}
{"text":"I've ordered their rotis pretty often - sag paneer, lamb, chicken - and they are consistently great.   Their decor isn't very impressive, but it works. There's enough seating for maybe 15 people. Most of the time I call and order take out and just pick it up. It's always on time.   Prices are good. The portion is large enough for 2 dinners.   I've been here with an Indian friend who confirmed that their food is great!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a co-worker.   Love this place!  Pretty clean and the food is always good.  If you like Indian and are in the area stop in for a good bite!  Good way better then the coworker!  He fills my ears with nonsense while I fill up in good food!  Eat On!"}
{"text":"Staff super friendly and helpful with dish choice, especially accommodating kids. Portions perfectly generous. Chicken Biryani hot is divine. Set the new bar. Wife and kids enjoyed lamb jalfrezi on rice. They'll do any roti dish on rice. Except Vindaloo, all dishes mild by default and can specify medium or hot. Spice addition is done just right. Mango lassi is from powder like many places nowadays. Still a treat. Will go out of my way to get back here. Very short walk from Dupont subway station makes that easy though."}
{"text":"It's cold out, you're tired and you crave something rich and comforting. You live in the area and don't feel like cooking. Why don't you pass by on your way home and take out one of the roti dishes to split with your partner or friend? (Or curl up solo on the couch with a movie and have lots of leftovers).   Served with some light greens, it's a cheap and satisfying meal. About 5 dollars a person for their basic but tasty mixed-vegetable korma roti, saag paneer roti or about 9 other dishes for under ~10 dollars with tax.   See menu and takeout menu here: http://www.roticuisineofindia.com/Roti-Cusine-menu.html"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I find excuses to go out of my way to eat the roti here. It's huge and yummy and super filling.   The saag paneer & vegetable korma are my favourite.  Ask for tamarind sauce on the side- it's delicious."}
{"text":"East indian style roti. Portion is so heavy but tastes so good that you cant help but finish it. They only serve indian beers like tiger and king fisher. I asked for extra spicy and boy did they deliver. I usually buy west indian styled Roti, so this was definitely a treat to my pallete. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Great food - very quick service.  Portion sizes are large so come with an appetite.  We were skeptical at first but the place smells so good.  When we finally decided to order and pickup the place was packed (always a good sign).  The spices also get an honourable mention!"}
{"text":"Let's say: 3.5 for me.  Since the place is so close to my apartment and it got positive review, I decided to go their to check it out.  I had a chick pea and potato (chinna?) roti and two vege samosas for $13 including tax. The roti was big and the taste was great. Samosa was hot and clispy. I enjoyed both of them very much.  Interior of the restaurant was quite simple and tiny. Probably I'll never eat there, but take out because I love to try other rotis in the future."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of Roti Cuisine of India. The prices are right, the food is DELICIOUS and such a cool take on Indian food. While the restaurant isn't really nice or somewhere you want to take a date, grabbing take-out from here is the best. I love the saag paneer roti, the mattar paneer roti, and the mixed vegetable curry roti. Sooo yummy.   Finish your meal off with a gulab jamaan and you'll be good to go :)"}
{"text":"Got the saag paneer roti and it was great! Giant portions, you can easily share a roti unless you're cultivating mass like the rest of these reviewers must be. Samosas were decent too."}
{"text":"I LOVE these rotis!! One is definitely big enough for two people. Be forewarned, when they say spicy...they really mean it! I have a high spice meter and even for me it is hot. They also have this AWESOME dish that is around 3-4 dollars that I often order with chick peas and deep fried goodness! I would always recommend this place for someone looking for a delicious filling meal!"}
{"text":"Very good Indian food on Dupont St. The decor is a bit dated and place is small but the food tastes excellent. Roti was done perfectly. I dined in and ordered takeout here. Seems like when you dine in you get a bigger portion; I was unable to finish my chicken roti here today as the roti seemed much bigger and had more chicken and potatoes in it. But either way the price was quite reasonable.  The server was friendly and helpful. He did seem a bit overworked though and forgot to bring me cutlery when the food came. Can't blame him as he was the only one taking orders and bringing dishes to the table, in this really tiny restaurant.  Definitely worth trying if you're into Indian cusine!  Debit or cash only."}
{"text":"Was feeling like Indian food and I have been a long night time ago but never wrote a review. I decided to go with the Matar Paneer with Roti. 10 plus taxes. The good is there's lots of Paneer in it. No skimping. I like the foil take out container. Holds the heat. It's made fresh from what I can tell, fresh as in they have to cook the roti and reheat your dish. I've cooked Indian food so I don't think this can be cooked in 10 minutes!! I asked for mild and it still has a bite lol. My kid hates spicy so I'll have to skip this one for him. Overall if you're in the area it's a good place to grab Indian food. Don't think I'd go out of my way to come but I suppose never say never cause I haven't tried enough dishes yet! the bad is cash only I think. I didn't have a napkin in my take out bag. And honestly I don't think I'd want to eat this without a fork or spoon! if you're looking for decor and ambience, look elsewhere.  But if you're in area it's worth a go"}
{"text":"Hey, look! There's an Indian roti place where that sketchy Dragon-something Chinese takeout place was! Even the little plastic buddha on the counter and Chinese wall-hangings are still there. Despite the minimal effort in displacing the not-so-fond memories of the old Chinese joint, these rotis were pretty ace. Gentleman in the front had no problem outlining which roti were veg/vegan and the larger selection of veggie offerings was definitely a welcome change.  Roti was well spiced, and the \"medium hot\" is perfect for someone that generally finds the heat of Gandhi/Mother India rotis a tad overwhelming. Saag aloo roti that I ordered today had a perfectly cooked shell, smelled incredible - and the filling was just right. Not too salty and/or soupy (as I found to Vena's and Caribbean Roti Palace to be - not slagging them, but it's a matter of individual tastes).   Large portion that fills the aluminum take-out container and quick turnaround for take out. What's not to like?  In conclusion: For years, I've endured the long wait times, modest but off-putting penalties for veggie additions and the often insufferable Queen St West in order to get awesome roti at Gandhi. Though Mother India (further west) was a nice addition, it is still out of my way.  No longer. With the additional of Roti Cuisine of India to the Annex, and the equally rad Caribbean roti place Island Cuisine in the York University area (on Keele, between Steeles and Finch) - I've calculated that I am now never further than a 10 minute bike ride away from incredible roti. Life is good."}
{"text":"Just fabulous good butter chicken roti and curry chicken roti (mild ...).   The place is small ... seats 20? It's not fancy, but it's fairly well-kept and it's as great as any place when it's cold and rainy out and you need to nuke your autumnal/winter disease with something curry.   Great location -- right on top of Dupont Station.  Service is always fine and friendly. Lots of take-out service; we've phoned ahead plenty of times. Takes debit, but I'm not sure about credit (not sure we've ever tried).   Huge portions. Roti in general are kind of enormous, but these are just a bit bigger. Really good flavour. Take-out always comes with a rice pudding dessert. Leftovers (and somebody always has leftovers ... usually me) are pretty excellent the next day or the day after that.  A favourite."}
{"text":"Review of individual rotis (note: they ALL have those potato cubes in them....sounds odd but it actually works) in order of my personal preference. Mattar paneer - Fantastic. It's perfectly creamy and delicious. Eggplant and potato curry - Eggplant is a very meaty vegetable so the roti makes for a hearty and solid meal. The eggplant isn't mashed to a solid pulp the way 'baigan\" dishes usually are so one can really enjoy it here. Saag paneer - Oh my god. I've never liked saag. In fact, I've always hated spinach with a passion. But I LOVE this roti. The key difference from typical restaurant fare here is that this saag is slightly creamy which makes it taste perfect instead of overwhelmingly of spinach.  Chicken tikka masala - Great chicken roti. I love the kick from the masala. Butter chicken - I've never liked butter chicken as I usually prefer chicken tikka masala as it's got a better kick.  But from an objective manner, the butter chicken was decent. Vegetable korma roti - I can see how some might like it but it's just too plain for me. Cauliflower, peas, potato (and maybe some other vegetables I'm missing) in a korma sauce but even at a solid medium spice level, it's just too plain. Maybe it's the sauce, maybe it's the combination with the veggies....whatever it is, I'm just not a fan.  The chilly gobi is essentially super spicy gobi manchurian but is delicious.   This is what eating here for a SOLID week does to you. Figured I might as well publish a miniature guide."}
{"text":"This place is close to my house and we come often.  The place is mainly take-out, we have never eaten in store (although they do have Kingfisher beer for sale). Take out is generally pretty quick even on busy nights. Roti portions are huge enough to make two meals out of. My favourite by far would have to be the Korma! Only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it isn't incredibly cheap, but as I mentioned, the portions are plenty."}
{"text":"Got takeout and wasn't displeased.  The portions are a good size, the food is pretty good, and the prices aren't out of reason.  Had the lamb curry and the chicken jalfrezi rotis.  The curry sauce is a really nice flavour and the roti wrap itself has a good consistency to it. While the lamb was super tender, flavour wise seemed unseasoned and a bit underwhelming. The chcken jalfrezi has a little bit of added vegetables (most visually identifiable being lots of peas) and had a savoury but again kind of flat taste to it. I wish the flavours and seasonings were more pronounced, instead of having to rely on hot sauce to give it the kick into flavour country I was looking for.  Its decent though, and I'm not sure there is many other options for roti in that stretch of town so I'd likely give them another go, but wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"The place isn't anything fancy, but the rotis are really gooood! I usually do weekend takeout from there and we love it! :)"}
{"text":"AMAZING food!  I ordered for pick up and the food was hot and ready on time and the employee was super polite and helped me cash out really quick.  I ordered the Mattar Paneer Roti and the Butter Chicken Roti. They were so delicious! The portions were enormous so I had enough left over for lunch the next day. The food is definitely worth the price.  The interior feels like a food court but it's easily forgiven considering the food is delicious. Hopefully management will make efforts to make the Dupont location look more fancy!"}
{"text":"Disappointed by the food and the staff. There was a misunderstanding with the order and the wrong item was made for us. We showed them the error and they said it was too bad and that what's ordered. We then paid again to have the correct order made. Not right!"}
{"text":"After a cold winter day, a warm steaming hot roti is the best for dinner. I ordered the saag paneer (spinach and cottage cheese) roti ($8.99) and the vegetable samosa ($3.50).   I was expecting the samosas to be a lot smaller, but they were two huge deep fried clouds of awesomeness. The potato and peas were flavoured and the sauce on the side added a nice spicy kick. Well worth it for the price.  The saag paneer roti was so huge that I had half of it for lunch the next day. You can get a wide range of spiciness. I picked mild and it was not spicy at all. The cottage cheese was in blocks within the spinach and potato filling.  There is limited seating, so if you are in a large group, you should consider takeout. Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"They have excellent roti. Especially enjoy curry chicken, spicy is hot! The interior is cramped, never sit by the cash or u will be swamped.  A number of times staff was confused, mixing orders up.  Best for take out."}
{"text":"Best Roti in the city. Great, filling vegetarian dishes at affordable prices.   We litterally stopped people walking down Dupont and asked where their awesome smelling take out was from. It was here.   My choice won this time: Malai Kofta Roti. Top notch. Wife's choice was also great, just not quite as great: Daal Pakora Roti.   We got take out this time but will be back to enjoy a meal with the Kingfisher beer (also spotted they have Cheetah).   Thoroughly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We love the roti! Come for the takeout, leave for the decor. It's not anything to look at, but if you are looking for a tasty filling meal, this is it. My favourites are the butter chicken roti and the saag paneer roti.  Tip: if you ask for \"mild,\" it's still pretty spicy (for people who are likely to order mild). But, you can say \"no spice\" and get it reeeeally mild.  Cash only but they have an ATM."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from here and was overall very satisfied. Location is convenient (right outside Dupont station), service was quick, and food came piping hot.   I got the shrimp curry roti and it was delicious! Filled with lots of shrimp and potatoes, a medium level of spice gave it the perfect amount of spiciness. Also, the other reviewers weren't lying when they said the portions are huge; you could probably split one roti into two meals.  Kind of disappointed that they didn't have veggie samosas when I went, but I guess I'll just have to try them next time!"}
{"text":"Tried the butter chicken roti. It's alright. But I prefer the restaurant on College called \"Butter Chicken Roti\". It's much better.  Also, service was super slow. I called in a take-out order (2 butter chicken rotis) and was told it would take 15-20 minutes. I arrived 20 minutes later and it still wasn't ready. Nearly 40 minutes after my call, I finally received the order.  And, as I said, it was alright....but there are better rotis out there."}
{"text":"Great service, great food! I tried their malai kofta Roti and their chicken curry Roti - both were delicious - fresh, hot and spiced the way I like it. I also tried their chicken biryani (extra spicy) which was soooo delicious! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great Food! Always get take out from here. But they increased the price and didn't change their menu online. Caught me by surprised when I went to pay for my take out. Apparently it was increased quite a while ago, but it was not reflected online :). Just a heads up when you order take out might be more than what you calculated"}
{"text":"The customer service is terrible. Unprofessional. Kitchen looks dirty. Food tasted like they heated up frozen vegetables."}
{"text":"I got a mali kofta roti to go. I was pretty disappointed to be honest, having had this dish many times. The sauce wasn't flavourful, it just tasted like spice basically and it was greasy (rather than rich)."}
{"text":"Amaaaaaaaazing roti's! I'm drooling just thinking about the butter chicken roti. Crispy on the outside and packed with meat/veggies and flavour on the inside. It's just PERFECT. I always ask for mild spicy level and they always deliver a perfect roti. Their Aloo Gobi is also good and their Channa roti. I miss going to school in the area because I constantly crave their rotis! If you're in the area it's a MUST try. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"delicious, big portions, food came quick! quaint inside but good attentive service! will come again :-)"}
{"text":"Since moving to TO, I'd only tried Gandhi's Roti/Mother India cause of all the rave reviews. Whilst both are ok, they're not great or maybe it's me?  I drove by Roti Cuisine many many times and one day finally pulled over&went in to do a takeout order.The server was very nice&efficient. I ordered one mattar paneer roti, one butter chicken roti&raita. I asked for mild as I have a smalll child who  won't eat spicy foods. As I waited, quite a few takeout orders were picked up and there were diners in the restaurant. It was 7pm approx. The couple next to me polished their rotis, which are pretty big&2 meals for me&the man was literally licking his plate. Loll! I figured the roti must be amazing or he was really hungry. I wanted to tell him to order another when he picked up his plate for another lick. Anyways, poorly mannered (or complimentive?) diners aside, the decor is not great but it's clean. The order was ready quite quickly&server threw in a free small container of kheer for my toddler. That was sweet of him. The rotis were still piping hot when we got home. They were very delicious!!! Yummmy! They were spicy and not mild in my opinion but still very good. As usual, the veggie one was better. Unlike Gandhi's, there wasn't a lot of potato filler in the rotis to skimp on chicken or paneer. The filling was plentiful and actually what it's supposed to be. I love potatoes but when someone orders chicken or lamb and gets mainly potatoes like at Gandhi's, that's disappointing. Overall, as an Indian who doesn't cook much Indian at home- I know I should and keep meaning too- it's nice to find tasty, affordable and quick roti for my occassional cravings. I will definitely return again and try other veggie options like saag paneer. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Food is good. The butter chicken roti is very good! I like that Food came out super hot and fresh. Service is acceptable!"}
{"text":"I lived near Gandhi for years before Queen West was hip and was craving Indian food and found this place, which seemed easily to commute to vs Queen West busy streetcar.  I've tried the chicken jalfrezi roti and it was good, but very runny and not quite curry enough...I've never had this dish before so I can't compare.  I came back 2 days later for what I be been really craving, which is chicken vindaloo, and it's tasty and way better than the jalfrezi, but I've had better vindaloo at a couple of other places before.  Portion size is good, but feel it could have a bit more chicken considering it's a meat dish.  My minor issues is that I didn't know rice could be substituted for roti until after I paid during my first visit.  On my second visit, I ordered 2 vindaloo chicken dishes (1 with rice on side), but when I got home one of the curries leaked a handful of liquid into the plastic bag and a bit soaked through due to the weight of 3 containers so going forward, I will l ask them to not pack more than 2 containers together if and when I return."}
{"text":"Best Roti in town. Staffs are friendly, location is great (few blocks away from subway station) especially if you are coming here to watch plays.  Their curries is by far one of the richest in town. Tasty and favourable.  I would love to try Biryani next time."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the Roti here! I get takeout whenever I'm in the area, I can't resist. I usually go dairy free, so the chicken curry and Ali gobi rotis are my choice. I take it home for my boyfriend and I to share and we get 2 meals each out of it (for $20!) great deal and delicious.   My one complaint is that twice in a row I've ordered the mango chutney and it tasted very strange. Almost \"chemically\" is the only way I know how to describe it. Very disappointing as I love chutney! But I survived because the rotis are good on their own."}
{"text":"Best butter chicken roti I've ever had!  This place is best for take out over dining in, and has very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I often do takeout when I'm looking for a delicious and hearty meal. I often get the butter chicken roti but the goat, lamb, or chicken rotis are all great. This place is always consistent in quality and the portion size is massive."}
{"text":"Went here again cause I was craving Roti and was a long the route while going home. Ordered 2 chicken Roti to go, called along the way and they had it ready in 10-15mins, the Roti tasted so good that all the ingredients added was so fresh. The chicken pieces they put was very generous, fresh and juicy and not dried. Will continue to order Roti from this location."}
{"text":"Easy go to place for a butter chicken roti. Efficient staff, decor is nothing to write about: bare bones basic. Side street parking and close to the subway."}
{"text":"This is a very basic restaurant that only has a few tables and nothing fancy in décor. But they don't need too because they make delicious Roti. My dad and I stopped there after visiting nearby tourist attractions and I was in the mood for Indian and consulted yelp to find out what's near by. My dad got Moli kopha (sorry for the misspellings) and I got butter chicken. Both were very good although my dad didn't know what to expect since he never had Roti before.  Very good, and if you're in the neighborhood, I recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"The butter chicken roti is amazing!  Even if you ask for mild, the spice level is different each time.  This place is on my way home from work, which can be dangerous.  Stays warm for a while, so takeout is great."}
{"text":"Decent Indian Roti's.  Back in April, I tried their Butter Chicken Roti and it was filling.  I only wish this place accepts credit cards.  They only take cash and debit."}
{"text":"I gotta say, I love their Rotis, absolutely delicious, but I get some really unpleasant side-effects the next morning if you know what I'm talkin' bout.  I don't know if this is a general Indian food thing and it does that to everyone or if it's my gentle constitution.  I would have given 5 stars if not for that."}
{"text":"The chicken biryani was a good portion and pretty good. I think the amount of chicken in the biryani could have been better."}
{"text":"Upon entering I was hit with an aroma of warm spices, which was a good start. What I liked about the place was that the waiter was very attentive. He explained that they can tailor spiciness for all the dishes. This pleased me immensely because I can't even look at a chilli pepper without my tongue curling. I had the shrimp curry with no spice. It was light and came out hot. I also tried the Lamb Madras which was a lot more flavorful. The roti was made well.  Factors for the negative review was that the decor itself isn't shabby, but it's far from nice. Also, there wasn't all that much seating. The food itself was OK as my friend's mom can make better curry. They should offer half their serving sizes because the portions are way too much. I couldn't eat for the rest of the day because the food didn't sit well with me at all. To top it all off, I found my final bill quite pricey but excused it for getting caught up in the hustle and bustle of a food adventure. I later realized it was because he already included gratuity without letting us know, and I had added an additional 15% tip. Not cool."}
{"text":"Delicious food! My Fave is the malai kofta roti. Apparently they no longer offer the chili ghobi... But I hope they bring that back to their Menu soon!"}
{"text":"Discovering this restaurant just enhanced living in the Annex by 10000%. It is now my new favourite place for, well, everything: late nights, cheap bites, spice, mild, everything. Roti is essentially a giant Indian burrito or crepe, made with roti (it's like an Indian tortilla) and stuffed with whatever your favourite Indian dish is, sans rice.  The first time round (yeah, I've been twice in the past week) a friend and I split the chaat, one of my favourite dishes, two vegetarian rotis and gulab jamun. It was a lot of filling food but I think the total came to $30 or so. The chaat was simple and cool and the gulab jamun was on par with others I had had in the past. The rotis were gigantic and phenomenal. We opted for saag paneer (spinach and chunks of cheese) and spiced eggplant and they hit the spot. Yummmm.  On my second visit, my friend and I simply got two rotis, this time with the mixed vegetables and eggplant and potato. My friend isn't into spice and thought the mixed vegetables was exactly what her sensitive palette was looking for, but I thought it was a bit boring. My eggplant and potato roti came with a big kick of spice (I love it and typically opt for medium), which warmed up a rather chilly Christmas Eve.  The man who runs the place is very friendly, chatty, and considerate and he'll be open to taking special requests. I think next time I go, I'll create an eggplant and paneer roti for an extra two bucks.  This place is great for take out and they make everything fairly quickly. Rotis are priced form $7 to $10 or so, other dishes are roughly the same. Appetizers and desserts are around $3 to $4. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is legit.  It is located in a tiny house near Dupon station.  I walked past it one day and I was hungry and thought I would give it a try.  I thought the person who took my order was exceptionally polite.  He let me know that the roti spices are pretty spicy and he recommended I get medium spice.  Good thing, too, because medium was plenty spicy for me (and I love spicy food).  The spice was just about right, however a little overpowering over the other flavours.  I can't even imagine how the high spicy level would have tasted.  Next time, I think I will try the mild just to compare.  It was a filling roti and by the end I was pretty stuffed.  I would come here again."}
