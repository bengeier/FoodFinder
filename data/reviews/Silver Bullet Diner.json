{"text":"This is our fourth time here and this place still surprises us. We entered and were immediately greeted and advised to sit wherever. Within seconds, our favorite silver diner employee (Ash) brings my husband a coke and me a coffee without us ordering because every time we come, that's what we order. She brings a small town feel to the area and it's simply refreshing and much appreciated. Food is great but Ash makes the experience memorable."}
{"text":"Messed up both my wife's and my order...my order twice. The food was way below par...my roast beef sandwich was extremely dry and my \"cheese sauce\" which I was charged $1.60 for was actually just a single piece of American cheese melted over my fries. WILL NEVER BE BACK! Please don't waste your time or money going here."}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant. All day breakfast. Authentic lamb gryos sliced from a rotating spit with made from scratch white sauce.  Massive hamburgers... you'll have to wait for these to cook. Reasonable prices with daily specials."}
{"text":"On our way to museum, ONE OF THE BEST Diners I have been to, being from Jersey, the diner capital of the world, wish they had a place near me!! Great food, great service!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice alternative to some of the other crowded places to eat on Albermarle Rd. I had breakfast here twice, once was dine in and the other time was to go. The food is good, the inside can use some upgrades but once people start going here hopefully they spruce the place up a bit. They just opened up not too long ago. I will say it's a few weeks old. Give them a shot it's not bad.

It's been a while since I left a review on this place. It's March 28th 2017 and I stopped in for the breakfast special and it was well worth it. This place  still gets good reviews from me. I posted pics of the special and what I got. Give them a shot, it's good."}
{"text":"1st time there today, got the chicken 
Gyro platter it was delicious, customer service was good waitress was very nice... an unruly customer was there but the issue was quickly resolved I'll definitely return..."}
{"text":"Stopped by and had a cheeseburger and fries for lunch. Both were very good!  Hamburger was big and all beef, fries were the twice fried ones. This place seems famous for breakfast, I will return to try it."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because well I haven't tried it and it's near my office. I ordered the Western Omelet with home fries and wheat toast to go. I get to my office and the food is piping hot but the toast is soggy due to the steam and them wrapping in aluminum foil. I dig in to the Omelet and nowhere to be found in the land of styrofoam and overcooked eggs is cheese. 

I thought: \"this must be a mistake\" so I called to verify and the person answered the phone and verified that the Omelet does not come with cheese. Like who in the heck makes omelettes without cheese?! The homefries were just ok. Needed ketchup or some salt. I'm disappointed because it's too late for me to return or reorder :("}
{"text":"Food was excellent and received in a timely manner also the waitress Cleidy was very pleasant and professional... definitely recommend eating their."}
{"text":"Tried this diner because sunrise has closed. Worst decision ever!!! Walked in and stood waiting to find out if you seat yourself or if you wait to be seated. I ended up having to ask what to do. When I sat down I waited for awhile and ended up having to get up to get a menu myself. Ordered a drink about 5 minutes later which was the first time I had any contact with the waitress. The waitress was very short and rude. The food was actually pretty good which is a shame since the customer service( what customer service???) was the worst!!! I will never return! Don't go here!"}
{"text":"Great little diner with good food at reasonable prices! Their coffee is the best diner coffee I have ever had! All others are weak compared to theirs! And their pancakes put other diners in the area to shame. They are huge and fluffy! Great breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Decided to eat here bc I pass it daily. Normal diner type feel. I order the chicken wrap with no rice and waffle fries. Both were amazing. The only downfall was that it took forever for our food to come out. Besides that, our service was good!"}
{"text":"Stopped with my we ife for lunch. The food was good, but it took nearly an hour to get to our table.  I'll still come again. I had the steak and cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a place to have some decent breakfast at and this place is defienetly a win! They had a variety of food options for whatever you're craving. The only con is the cleanliness of the dishes and tables but other than that I will be back VERY soon!!"}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood spot! Good breakfast. Friendly staff. Great price. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was recently contacted that this diner is under new management, I wanted to be fair and put 3 stars vs one so others wouldn't judge on previous review with past management.  I look forward to visiting again with the new management and updating my review ."}
{"text":"Wow. It's been awhile since I've had to wait that long for food, especially breakfast food. I had the \"scrambled\" eggs with cheddar, sausage, waffle, and grits. 

I really enjoyed the sausage and the grits. The waffle and eggs were just ok. The eggs looked more like an omelette than scrambled and the cheese was on top and not mixed in. 

The waitress was nice but was very distracted. My silverware, although wrapped, was touching the table. For a germophobe like me, that's a no-no.

It even took a long time when we were paying lol. If you're in a hurry and just want a quick bite, stay away but if you're in the mood for diner food  and have a lot of time on your hands then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The worst. We've been twice now & have had to wait at least 45 minutes for breakfast food. Today my scrambled eggs were burnt, our order was wrong, we never received toast, and our drinks weren't refilled. Never again!"}
{"text":"We finally stopped in and we were not disappointed. I ordered the Botas omelet with hashbrowns. The jalape√±os were fresh! My son ordered a bacon burger with waffle fries. The burger was hand pattied and huge, cooked perfectly. The waffle fries may be the best that either of us have ever had. The food was a little slow coming out, but I chalk that up to the fact that they were getting ready to close for the day and invited us and another larger group in anyway. The young man serving us couldn't have been nicer or more attentive. I rarely review places on Yelp, but I really want this place to survive."}
