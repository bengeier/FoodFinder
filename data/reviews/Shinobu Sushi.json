{"text":"Nice cozy Japanese restaurant. 
Service is good. Fish is fresh and cooked dishes are tasty. 
Sashimi plate is good but less portion and variety compare with ND sushi & grill. Dashi (Japanese soup stock usually made from fish and kelp) is great!!
Not many seats. So if you are planning to go weekend dinner, make reservation will save your time!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Japanese restaurants in the GTA. Small but cozy, shinobu offers an exquisite dinnng experience. An exploration of the senses. An explosion of flavours. All accompanied with a very pleasant and genuinely courteous waiting staff."}
{"text":"Love this place. Probably the closest thing to real (ie. not run by Koreans or Chinese) Japanese food as you can get at a reasonable price in Toronto.

We had a $60 per person menu that was created by the chef and it was really good. I just wish I could have had more. 

The place is tiny - make reservations! 

Haven't been here for lunch, but the lunch menu looked excellent and very well-priced."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The sushi is always unbelievably fresh and the service is incredible and genuinely friendly. By far the best sushi in NT."}
{"text":"It's a very small place, but great service! Reservations highly recommended. Fish is fresh and dishes are unique!"}
{"text":"Went for sushi with high expectations since we have read so many good reviews. however, I am deeply disappointed. the restaurant has about 6 tables only but it takes them more than 25 minutes to serve an appetizer, 60 minutes for the main sushi. the food quality is no where near the price it charges neither. the nigiri rice was so hard that it tasted like over night rice. the sashimi was good. the fish was fresh and the texture was firm. we would not go back except for the sashimi. also we probably would do take out only to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"Yum!  I have been to this restaurant a few times and I have never been disappointed.  The sashimi is very fresh!  The mackerel is delicious.  Nice presentation of the food.  Good service.  The only reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the size of the restaurant.  Seating is limited and intimate.  Make a reservation to avoid disappointment!"}
{"text":"This place is good.

A bit pricey but sushi was one of the better ones I've had in Toronto.

Restaurant is small and kinda ghetto but I have no issues with that.

Service is prompt, friendly and adequate.  

I would recommend this place to my dearest of friends and my mother."}
{"text":"I've been going to Shinobu since '09, and I never get sick of this place. It is really hard to find good authentic Japanese food for such price range in Toronto. 

Food: 
- I've tried most of their dishes from the regular menu. Althought they don't offer too much of Japanese authenticity in their menu, among all, my top three picks are: Volcano Rainbow Roll, Mt. Fuji Salad, and Assorted Sushi. I get volcano rainbow rolls every time I go Shinobu to eat. Not only it's eye-catching, but also it tastes very good. Avocado gets creamy due to heat, and everything blends in so well with the honey sauce. Mt. Fuji Salad can be seen as ordinary spring salad. But their goma dressing brings so much flavor to the greens. Lastly, their assorted sushi, is good. Out of all, raw squid and raw shrimp are really fresh. Only thing is that, they put little too much wasabi on the bed of rice, so it takes flavor away.

Service:
- Staffs are amazing. They are attentive, friendly, and they try to make up to your requirements. And the chef on the sushi table always says thank you and bye when we leave. Can't find a single problem with the staff members. 

Atmosphere:
- It's really small. It's a must to make reservations for weekend dinner. There is nothing fancy it to it. 

 If you are looking for a fairly good Japanese dinner from Japanese chefs for a decent price, Shinobu is it."}
{"text":"This place is great!
Went with 3 friends and everyone enjoyed the food. We ordered various salads, miso soup, and a few rolls. Everything was extremely tasty and fresh. Service was courteous and swift.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is one of only two sushi restaurants we go to in the city, and we love this small, intimate place that's usually filled with Japanese locals. 

Skip the sushi menu and go for the omakase (choice of the chef) as its best to let them choose. Very fresh here and well worth the price.

As for appetizers, when we do indulge we love the ToriTen NanBan which is made in traditional Oita area style, and the Nankotsu kara-age are both great deep fried chicken dishes that are great guilty pleasures and not greasy at all. 

There's home made kurogoma ice cream (black sesame) or macha (green tea) to end your dinner on a sweet note..

This is definitely a place to go."}
{"text":"Fav local place, for kids and I to grab sushi. The food is consistently great. Could be ideal for an intimate casual date too. The place is tiny, ran down, and a little cramped with Japanese decor. The hours of operation are weird too. Check before heading over and make reservations because they are always busy and will turn you away."}
{"text":"Best jap restaurant in tdot. By far. Trust me"}
{"text":"Friend and I went here on a sunny Saturday afternoon.

We were starving. Had:

Lobster Roll - there was lobster meat there with an empty lobster tail for decor. 
Sashimi combo (inc' rice) - fish tasted fresh but was a bit thin. 
Grilled Squid - friend's comment: grilled but not charred. I've always like this dish at any Japanes restaurant. This is no exception. The texture was not too chewy or dry which happens when overcooked.
Spicy Shrimp Tempura - I've had better. It was fried to the right temperature as it wasn't overly greasy but the batter itself was heavier than i thought.

On top, we eat had a beer, Asahi dry and Kirin.

The server brought us our bill before we finished which I find a bit rude when we were the only patrons in the restaurant and she never brought us water until we asked at the very end. 

this lunch came out to be $75 after taxes and tips. Definitely on the expensive. Probably next time skip the sashimi and do more of the daily special rolls (lobster roll being one of them)

I would eat there if I'm in the neighbourhood but not out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"Cost: reasonable
Quality: good - 85%
Decor: poor - 60% typical \"no decor\" authentic Jap restaurant here
Staff: average service - 75%
Value: good - 85%

Keeper? Yes like it there when we can get a seat, but it's hard."}
{"text":"Service is always slow, but their tempura chicken kept us coming back! Miso eggplant is always very good, the better ones in Toronto.

Sashimi quality is not very consistent, at times you could get better quality at Taro Fish Sushi. At times the quality is reasonable for its price."}
{"text":"4.5 stars in my books!  Shinobu is exactly what I love in a Japanese restaurant: a homey feel, friendly staff, and fresh & authentic nigiri.  Sure, its decor is basic at best but that's part of its charm.  Volcano roll is proportioned well in terms of rice and sushi deluxe combo is great for two people to share (you won't get two of each piece but it's great value for the amount of food you get).  Their salmon yukke (seared, chopped salmon) is so flavourful and perfectly seasoned.  The staff are always accommodating and allow you to order off the menu; if they're able to fulfill your request, they definitely will.  Once, I called to make a reservation at a certain time but was told there were no tables at that time so I settled for a later dinner reservation - half an hour later, they made the effort to call back and let me know there was availability after all.  Great service!"}
{"text":"I would say that Shinobu is one of the best I've had in a long time!

Very Japanese-like restaurant, and being one myself, I felt very comfortable with the atmosphere and felt like I was in Japan.

The menu selection is very good and the specials are great as well.

Make sure to book a table before you go...  it gets crowded really fast, and you don't want to make the trek out only to find there's not table available."}
{"text":"Great food. Not only sushi, but everything is so tasty! Small place with many small tables, some people may feel they are too close to the next tables. It does not bother me. Not for formal dinner. Great for dates and casual get together with close friends."}
{"text":"Shinobu is an exceptional Japanese place if food matters to you more than the decor.  I will have agree that the decor could use a little help, but then if you have been to a neighborhood restaurant in Japan, that's pretty much the kind of decor you would get.  

The food was amazing!  We started of with drinks: I had ume-sour, my dinner companions had lemon-sour and grapefruit-sour.  All drinks were deliciously refreshing with well-balanced flavour.  For our appetizer we went with torikawa (crispy, deep-fried chicken skin) and broiled eggplant with miso.  Both were flavourfull and delicious; I would recommend getting beer to go with torikawa.  For my main I ordered goshiki natto don; if you have never had natto, I would strongly discourage you from getting the dish.  Natto is fermented soy beans covered in slime... yep.  And while they are very healthy, it's an acquired taste.  I happen to like it, so I loved the goshiki natto don.  

Another thing I absolutely loved about the restaurant is the quality of their rice; great rice to start with, perfectly seasoned."}
{"text":"My Japanese Friend and his wife got to choose our once-a-month-dinner-party-location for November, and My Japanese friend's father suggested Shinobu. We were thrilled to go after reading the reviews here, and my SO who lived in Japan for several years was excited to sample some authentic Japanese fares. 

To be honest, the menu was fairly Westernized, I was expecting some more things that I hadn't seen before, but the quality was fantastic. We made reservations in advance, as we are a party of 6, and it is a tiny place which seats maybe 20. Our server was very accommodating and super nice, and my tea was refilled often. The Japanese member of our group did the ordering, and we ended up with some Seafood Yakitori, a wide variety of Maki, Gyoza, Incredible tasting and perfectly cooked tempura shrimp with spicy sauce and Supurb Age Dashi Tofu. The Maki were all super fresh, with quality fish and a good rice ratio. There was an incredible brightness in each bite. 

The entire restaurant was filled with Japanese people other than us, lending to the authenticity. 

I still think that the Sushi Marche Maki are better with the citrus and fresh flowers, but for sit down and \"Tapas\" and overall selection Shinobu Sushi really shines.

Bonus Points for the white Fresh pickled ginger and the friendly sushi chef. 

4.5 Stars. Would be a full five if the atmosphere was a little nicer - the room is nothing spectacular to look at."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in Toronto. Everything was prepared correctly, and all the fish were fresh. It's a nice place for a dinner date. Reservation recommended!"}
{"text":"Giving Shinobu a second try after my first visit two years ago as it has pretty good rating on Yelp and Google... Nah...Disappointing!

It was never memorable at first visit.  But after this meal I am sure I can cross this out of my list for Japanese food.  

Atmosphere
Crowded table setting, but that's usually the case with these type of cozy family run Japanese restaurant.  What I didn't like is their unsafe and unprofessional installation of heater on the ceiling above the seating.  It felt like the place is going to fall apart any minute during my meal.

Food
Toriten nanban - Fried Chicken
Good amount of batter and not too oily - enjoyable dish to begin.

Supreme assorted nigiri for $29.95. (10pc)
Nice variety of fish and presentation...but the biggest draw back was their mushy and overly sweetened rice.  The proportion or fish and rice is out of balance as the fish is too thin for any taste of the fish.  

Dream Roll - Fish roe, scallop and spicy salmon
I was expecting this dish to be very flavorful, given that it topped with fish roe and spicy salmon.  But the taste was very mild and almost undetectable.  The roll was also falling apart when we dip it with soy sauce...

Sorry to say I am never coming back...my all time favorite Aoyama Sushi has much better sushi and sashimi than Shinobu."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic. Shinobu is a tiny little Japanese place on Yonge Street by Yonge & Yonge Boulevard. The staff is incredibly friendly and you can tell that they enjoy the business of their customers. The food is impeccable, notably the sushi rice. The sushi rice is always a perfect temperature and texture, which really makes the sushi much more enjoyable than competitors in the area that I've also been to."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and nicely prepared. We had tried the ume sushi (6 california rolls + nigiri chef selection), spicy salmon + scallop roll, and chicken tempura aka toriten nanban - which was the best unique item I tried that night. 

Cost is bit higher than average expect to pay 20per person with some vegetarian rolls coming in at around 5 which is inexpensive, some specialty rolls higher at 12+

But in my opinion this is strictly a take out place. Decor is sparse, the place is cold, small, garage door which is the front window by the way leaks, there's heating fans on the floors and red curtain draping the front is ikea -- tacky. There was some some bossa nova tunes playing in the background but it couldn't overcome this sore looking looking restaurant that desperately needs a makeover."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Volcano rainbow roll and sashimi are delicious. Super fresh and the service is great:)"}
{"text":"Not your typical Toronto sushi bar. Shinobu is next level, authentic Japanese cuisine. Get past the modest decor, it's all about the delicious abd authentic food here. Order ALL the specials which change daily, you wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for dinner and have never been disappointed!  Be sure to make a reservation because it's a pretty small restaurant and you likely will not be able to get a table on a Friday/Saturday night without a reservation.
We typically order the omakase (you have to book this ahead of time) for half the table and we'll order a few extra dishes on top of that.  As omakase goes their portions sizes are big - you definitely won't leave hungry.
I think their seared mackerel is a staple of their omakase menu - and it's really awesome!
They have a good variety of sashimi - their shrimp is so so sweet; I also really like their conch sashimi.  Their sushi and rolls are all well done too - my favourite roll is the lobster roll."}
{"text":"So there are only a few Japanese restaurants run by experienced Japanese chefs in Toronto and this is one of them. Chef Tamio is from Kyushu Japan and he knows sushi. Trained in Japan, worked as a sushi chef at Katsura (Westin hotel) and then started out on his own.  Chicken Nanban (fried chicken Kyushu style) is also a nice specialty. Very tasty.  Small restaurant and as with most good Japanese restaurants they are not focused on customer volume so you need reservations. Want 5 star service? - go to Auberge or Canoe. The servers here are Japanese part-timers. Come here for authentic tasty Japanese food at reasonable prices because Chef Tamio is making your sushi every single night."}
{"text":"Tiny place, 10 tables, 20 seats max capacity, make an RSVP. Sushi very fresh, care is taken into making a clean contemporary presentation, friendly smiley staff. Nori on the chewy side. Enjoyed the flammed volcano roll. 

Would recommend."}
{"text":"A Japanese friend recommended this place so we decided to try it out, turned out the rolls were not THAT impressive. 75%."}
{"text":"Past reviews are right about making reservations! You won't get a seat if you don't make one. A table for four left just in time for my 7:30PM reservation, so we were seated in less than five minutes. 

It's not exactly an impressive place with fancy decor to take your hot date, but I was hoping the food would make up for it. 

The $45 Omakase (Chef's Menu):
1. Mediocre salad - As you can see in the picture, it was pretty disappointing to be served a salad with some lettuce and some potato sticks as the first item from the Omakase. 

2. Seared mackerel - Undeniably fresh and seared with a blow torch(?) at the table. I normally do not enjoy mackerel, but these were tasty! 

3. Steamed egg - One of my favourite Japanese dishes! Shinobu's steamed egg is packed with ingredients (ie. jumbo shrimp, enoki mushroom)

4.Spanish Mackarel - Very nicely presented, but the sashimi itself was tough and the taste was overpowered by sliced ginger. 

5. Monk fish liver - Delicious, melts-in-your-mouth texture. It's almost as good as foie gras, seriously. 

6. Lobster roll - This is basically a spider roll, but with lobster in it. The rice was too warm, and the sushi kept falling apart. Some may be picky and dislike the fact you're unable to eat your sushi in one piece, but I guess it's all the same when it ends up in your tummy. 

7. Fried chicken?! - Another disappointing dish in this omakase. The chicken was very good, but if I wanted fried chicken, I would go to Korea town or maybe KFC. 

8. Ox Tongue - Tender and chewy, just the way I like it. Yet, another item I did not expect to see in an omakase. 

9. Assorted Nigiri - This was probably the best dish. The temperature was just right, and the rice was proportional to the sashimi, which was very fresh. 

10. Green Tea Cheesecake with Ginger Ice Cream - Real ginger pieces in the ice cream! I did not really enjoy the green tea cheese cake, the two flavours just don't mash up well. 

The service as A-OK. They do not wait for you to finish your food before immediately serving the next dish, which was very frustrating as there was no room on the table. The $45 Omakase was the most expensive choice there was and there was no sashimi dish, but instead hot dishes like fried chicken and ox tongue that you can get at AYCE places. 

Maybe my experience would be better if I order a la carte next time, but I would never order the omakase again."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! 

I looked on yelp for sushi places in north Toronto and found this option, thinking it would be great for sushi and a friend new to asian cuisine.  I was correct!  The staff was excellent and super friendly.  The turn around time was quick, and the food was amazing.  I have never had such a perfectly fresh roll of sushi, and the spider roll was the best I have ever had!  

If you are interested in going just be aware that there are only about 20 chairs and we had one of only 2 non reserved tables (luckily we went early on a weekday).  

I only give a 4 because it has a rather small list of menu choices for sushi (in my opinion), and because 5s are reserved for perfect everything experience.

Shinobu Sushi, I will gladly be a repeat customer in the future."}
{"text":"This place has a small selection of roll options and for some reason won't allow in restaurant pick up on Sunday, but does on other days. Their prices are reasonable, but the sushi itself is uninspired. I'm not really sure what the appeal is."}
{"text":"Make sure you try the Green Dragon.  Looks as good as it tastes.  Overall this is a great place for Sushi!  Although this restaurant is small in stature it makes up for it in freshness and selection.  While we enjoyed the sushi it was obvious that there was more available and it all smelled excellent.  Attentive service and quality presentation ensures that we, like Douglas MacArthur, will return.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Amazing find. Have been here twice and never diappointed.

The one sushi place in Toronto that actually has... wait for it... Japanese patrons! You knew this place would be good.

Extremely fresh fish, well prepared. A few modern twists but chef keeps it real without using stupid panko flakes, cream cheese, or any other of the awful ingredients used in fake sushi shops. There are some choices that are not listed on the menu, particularly homemade natto (fermented soy beans which we tried as a dare and turned out to be AWESOME).

The service is extremely friendly.

Place itself is a tiny hole-in-the-wall. No decor at all. Not a place to go for a fancy dinner but I would say a great intimate date place nonetheless."}
{"text":"I never would walked into this small restaurant but my friend treated me for my birthday.  Incredible food!!  Incredible service!!!  And authentic Japanese chefs.   I highly recommend this place for all sushi lovers!!"}
{"text":"Oh Shinobu - how you let me down.  Having been a few times and spending a fair amount (over $150 two weeks ago) came to get something with my Mum to enjoy. 

Being told it would take over an hour for take-out?  Are you kidding me?  There's FAR too much competition in the neighborhood for you to say something as absurd and inexplicable as that.  

I will grant you the compliment of exceptional food, priced well.  But when your space seats 20 people maximum and takeout provides you with revenue beyond your miniature walls - I'm baffled at how you can turn that down. 

Guess I'll be going elsewhere from now on.  Good sushi can be found nearby."}
{"text":"No doubt this is a great place. Reasonable price and excellent food!"}
{"text":"I found this place not too long ago and its fabulous. The pricing is fair...the food excellent and the best sushi, sashimi I have had in a long time it reminds me of the days before sushi became so commercial. I you do not try this place you will have missed out on something spectacular."}
{"text":"The food here is spectacular! Don't dismiss it just because of its appearance. It may look shabby, but the food is definitely worth it. I came here with my family for dinner and we tried many dishes. The sashimi was fresh and the hot appetizers tasted very authentic. My favorites were  the spicy shrimp tempura and the pork tempura. Service was average and the price was reasonable. Only reason I took a star off was because of the environment, very shabby. Otherwise it's a great place for a casual meal."}
{"text":"Their sushi rice was over cooked and very sticky! Not sure if it was just a one time mishap or it's just how they make the rice. Their fish was fresh and most of the appetizers were tasty. The fried oysters however, were way too hard and tasted just like dough."}
{"text":"I've tried most of the sushi spots in the area and I have to say that this one is the best.  They don't have a crazy huge menu but everything I've ever tried has been great, and I keep rotating different apps/sides dishes to go with their yummy rolls.  It's pretty rustic inside in terms of décor but the food and service is above average.  They seem to keep everything fresh and take pride in their work.  It costs a few bucks more than some other places but it's well worth it for the quality.  This spot is in my regular take out rotation and it's not going off anytime soon.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I love sushi, and eat a lot of it Toronto and elsewhere, and Shinobu is definitely one of my favorites. Best in Toronto so far. Not only is it fresh, but it's inventively prepared, beautifully presented, and just spectacularly good.

Ok longer story is....

So I was in San Fran a while back on my own, and UrbanSpooned my way to Sanraku on Sutter, now my favorite sushi place ever. Being on my own I sat at the sushi bar, and struck up conversation with both the other customers, and the sushi chef, Atsushi, trying a lot of things I don't usually try or see here in TO. I mentioned to Atsushi that I wish I could find a place in Toronto this good, and he told me he used to work here with a friend (Tamio) that now has his own place, Shinobu. Of course when I got back, I instantly had to try it, and I was not disappointed. It's fantastic. In fact, I went to both this week, and was very happy both times :)

Agreed with the other posters. It's a tiny but nice place, so call and book a table (and please show up! it's a tiny place!). Tamio and the staff there are friendly, attentive and helpful. There's always a list of really interesting specials on the chalkboard. The long-name-I-cant-pronounce pork dumplings with eggplant wrappers are fantastic. The big show is the Volcano Rainbow Roll, which, in addition to being fantastic on it's own, they drizzle with a little honey, and then take a blowtorch to at the table, just lightly caramelizing the top of the fish. As ness y. says, the sushi is great, but everything is fantastic. Even the fried chicken skin.

It's also hard to find, as mentioned, as they have a strange space-sharing arrangement with Maki Sushi (which is what is actually on the sign). During the day, it's Maki, at night, it's Shinobu.

Go. You will LOVE it. Great sushi. Great eel. Great date restaurant - small, cute, a \"find\", and you can dress it down or up. And great chef, who truly deserves the business and the recognition."}
{"text":"Very authentic Japanese food!
Delicious as well! One of my favourite in Toronto!
They have seasonal menu written on blackboard. 

This time they imported Blue Fin Tuna! Ootoro, chutoro, akami! Chutoro is my recommendation, melts in my mouth but not too oily! 

Oyster with Uni was a surprise combination that mingles perfectly! 

Make sure you make reservation for dinner or will be line up for long time!!"}
{"text":"Shinobu is secretly not-so-secret. That is, Yonge-Lawrence area locals and Japanese food \"experts\" know Shinobu well enough to know that it is closed on Monday; tables in the the 20-something seater are coveted; and take-out is the next best thing. Yet, around these parts, it's easy to breeze by the small store front with a glass garage-type patio facade/window onto the street. And really, who expects great Japanese food around Y&L?

Sushi is not the highlight at Shinobu. Everything shines. 
The service is kept friendly and attentive, without being overbearing. 
The appetizers are served tapas style - small, shareable, and unique. Salt seemed to be the theme among those we ordered: Chicken Skin (fried lightly to a crispy, but not so much as to lose the very distinct texture of fat - yes, fat. The seasoning reminded me of \"salt 'n pepper\" chicken/squid/shrimp at Chinese restaurants); the Seared Mackerel was only very slightly \"seared\", at the table with a blow torch, and served with fresh, finely grated ginger, thinly slivered green onions, and a dash of soy sauce; and lastly, a blandly seasoned, but well-fried Squid Tempura (named something else) with mild miso/soy dipping sauce. My favourite was the Chicken Skin, but I don't imagine I'd indulge often in the dish; partly because it's a special offering and partly because I need my heart for other things. My least favourite was the Squid Tempura as its name led me to believe it was going to be better than it actually was (read: I wouldn't have requested this dish if it had clearly stated Squid Tempura).
As for the rolls, we had the Green Dragon and Soft Shell Crab rolls. The fat-feel of the first was over-powering. They don't skimp on avocado here! Everything was well balanced in the second roll; there was just enough perfectly seasoned rice wrapped around tender-crisp crab. 
While some people eat sushi as a \"lighter\" meal option, the cuisine served here should not be mistaken as light fare. Rather, I consider Shinobu's food to be lux, comfy, and as \"stick-to-your-ribs\" as Japanese food can be well executed.

Yup. This place is a winner. Among my top five in North America."}
{"text":"A yelp friend was kind enough to give me the inside scoop on this hidden gem. Not really an area I normally get out to but after my Sushi treat, I will be back for sure. The restaurant is very simple in terms of atmosphere - there is none! Only a few tables so not a lot room, go early if you can or make a reservation.

The good....
- Service was excellent, very friendly and the food arrived fairly quickly.
- Incredible value, the fish quality is very good but with more affordable pricing relative to others. Two people (or maybe one  and a half) can eat for about  $40
- Started with the Chicken Tempura - Juicy chicken inside, fried outside. I enjoyed it but not very healthy, maybe share with a friend (The tarter sauce on the side was a let down though).
- The Volcano roll is good. They blowtorch the roll at the table. Blow torching Sushi to alter textures is nothing new but doing it at the table certainly is. Just my opinion, but this should be done before it's brought to the table.
- Matsu Sushi was the real standout for me, large pieces of fish, fresh, rice cooked correctly and Wasabi / spices added to the sushi to enhance flavour. Fantastic!

Shinobu's main negative is the lack of decor and style. When you walk in he door, your facing a hanging curtain which I assume is there to keep the cold out when the door opens but gives a bad first impression. I'm sure the no frills approach helps keep prices down..... but results in a lost star.

Shinobu excels at offering great quality sushi at a good price. This should be enough to keep Sushi lovers (and me) coming back for more despite the lack of style & decor.

Highly recommended

BK"}
{"text":"This place is a gem - for those of you folks who live uptown or midtown and want an authentic sushi Japanese restaurant without making the trek downtown, this is it.

I am a frequent customer. My favourites are their grilled Octopus, their flame torched mackeral sashimi, their deep fried chicken skin and their omakese sashimi.

You really can't go wrong here- every dish is at least an 8/10. I would also recommend trying their specials menu. I recently tried their pressed salmon sushi which was wonderful.

I would normally give it 5 stars - but fyi- seating is limited and cramped. Also it gets a bit drafty in the winter"}
{"text":"Over the last few years, izakayas have really become a hot trend of Toronto. Many places are just trying to cash in on the bandwagon, serving mediocre food for a tapas bar price, but Shinobu is definitely the exception. There is a reason why it is rated so highly on yelp.

The restaurant has the perfect balance of quality, taste and price. The sashimi is incredibly fresh, the appetizers clearly have a lot of care put into them, and all for less than what higher end restaurants will charge.

Definitely try the shimesaba (flame torched mackerel), chicken karaage (tempura fried chicken), and volcano rainbow roll (drizzled lightly with a honey sauce, then torched for caramelization). If you're feeling like a treat, order the supreme nigiri or sashimi and see what actually fresh fish tastes like.

Do not go to shinobu if you aren't an adventurous eater and don't like fish."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place. Just recently, tastetoronto.ca came out with a top ten sushi of Toronto list, and shinobu appeared as number 9. So the same day I read that list, I decided to go.

Went here on a Tuesday night. My friend and I ordered the matsu sushi, hotate dream roll, lobster roll, sashimi tray, and grilled squid.

All the rolls were decent, but I felt the rice wasn't as good as it should be. The rice I've had at Yasu, Jabistro, Zen, and Aoyama were noticeably better. In terms of fish freshness, they were also alright. I somehow had high expectation of the hotate dream roll (I don't know why haha), but when I had it, I was kind of disappointed. Again, the rice in all the rolls and sushi were meh.

Out of everything, the grilled squid was actually the highlight of the night. I enjoyed that much better than anything else. Also great miso soup.

My disappointment about this place was that Toro was not on the menu.

Service was great! Decor is lacking but no big deal. Parking is a bit of a pain because it's on yonge street.

Conclusion: Good sushi. I'd like to come back again and re-evaluate again, but as of now, I'm not sure this place should be in the top 10.

8/10 for quality. 9/10 for service. 8/10 for value. 8/10 overall (not an average)."}
{"text":"Shinobu Sushi was our last dinner in Toronto and we were just crossing our fingers that this place would leave a lasting impression on us as we headed back to Hawaii the next day, and all i can say is that our dining experience at Shinobu in Toronto did not disappoint but it wasn't mind blowing either. I have to say that my expectations are high being from Hawaii and all i can say is that the fish from Hawaii is unbelievably and uber fresh and the quality of food in Izakaya's here in Hawaii are simply outstanding and the only place i can think that can compete with Izakaya's here in Hawaii are those from Japan.

 Now one thing we really studied hard about eating at Izakaya's anywhere we go is that the owners definitely have to be from Japan and no place else because that's how we determine how good this place can be and we can actually say that it's authentic and after month's of studying about places to eat in Toronto and having my wife, who happens to be Japanese, looked at food blogs from Japanese who have been to Toronto, Shinobu seemed to be a very popular place to dine at since there were many favorable reviews about this place, so this was a place we had to try.

 Shinobu is a very small restaurant that has about six to seven tables and was very spacious and not too tight for a big guy like me. The service and staff here are very nice and welcoming and that was a big surprise after dining at other places in Toronto that make you feel like you have the plague or some sort of incurable disease. But i have found that eating at all these Japanese Restaurant's here in Toronto, they were all so cheerful and happy as if i were in Hawaii and they definitely had the Aloha Spirit.

 The menu here at Shinobu isn't as extensive as most Izakaya's i have frequented but i have to say that when it comes to value, they get high marks for that because the prices here to me are very reasonable for what you get. I also like the item's they offer throughout the menu even if it was limited. I also like the Specials they had for the evening.

 The Deep Fried Halibut Special was cooked to perfection. Light, Crisp, very mild and the pieces of Halibut were very generous for the price.

 The Toriten Nanban: Chicken Tempura with Tartar Sauce was really delicious and didn't need any sauce at all. I enjoyed it just the way it was.

 The Grilled Squid took a while to cook but was well worth the wait. Well executed and not chewy at all.

 Torikawa: If you like Crispy Chicken Skin like i do, then this is what to order. Crispy Chicken Skin and an ice cold Japanese Beer.....Heaven

 Lobster Roll: Kind of like a Spider Roll without the legs. Surpisingly good and presentation wonderful

 Now the Sushi Selection here at Shinobu is very reasonably priced but lacked the selections that i normally eat at Izakaya's or Sushi Bar's. What really disappointed me on this trip to Japanese Restaurant's here in Toronto is that there was no Uni to be found whatsoever. That is a big let down for me. How could they not get any type of Uni anywhere? Don't tell me it's off season or is it that hard to get Uni from Santa Barbara,Hokkaido, or even Boston? I always got to have my Uni fix when i travel and was so heartbroken when it wasn't available.

 I was also disappointed that Shinobu didn't have any O-Toro or Chu Toro available on their menu as well. I guess beggar's cant be chooser's but i expected a lot more from an Izakaya especially with the reputation they carry.

 We also ordered more things on the menu and all i can say is that you can't complain because of the price, but for a person like me, i don't mind spending on quality and at Shinobu i was hoping for much more but my expectation level may be a little too high.

 As for me coming back here again if i ever come to Toronto again? This place would definitely be a place i just might come back to, but i think the menu here is somewhat lacking for a person like myself but once again, the reason why i would come back here is for the value and for those of you people who want good value and not break the bank, i would have to say give it a try, i think you will leave here a happy camper if authentic Japanese Fare is what you are looking for without feeling like you got robbed."}
{"text":"Shinobu is still my favorite/number one sushi place in Toronto...I just can't get enough of it!!!! Though the space is so tiny, the quality of food that the sushi chef puts out time and time again makes that irrelevant: 

All time favorites:

-Agedashi Tofu: beautiful broth infused with ginger
-Chicken toriton nanban: Comfort food paired with tartar sauce
-Gyoza: Delicious
-Dragon roll: Love seeig the blow torch action
-Spicy tuna roll: Not the \"spicy\" mayo you're used to.
-Sweet potato roll"}

Our other favorites in the city are Japango, Asuka and Omi"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Authentic and yummy. Friendly staff!! Cozy environment. 
My favourite Japanese sushi restaurant so far. Best sushi rolls ever!!!! Definitely recommend the hotate dream rolls (salmon and scallop) and also their honey chicken and the grapefruit vodka. 
Love love loveeeeeee
The only downside is price. But it's worth it for what you get!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Shinobu on a whim due to the positive Yelp reviews. I was thoroughly disappointed by average tasting Japanese food (over cooked mushy rice!) and questionable cleanliness and safety of the restaurant (the curtain rods were held up by just packing tape). I've had better Japanese for less money."}
{"text":"This restaurant is small but I really like how they paid a lot of attention to the privacy of patrons eating (not allowing people on the street to peek through). I'd strongly recommend making reservations because of limited seating. 

The menu is quite small and the food is a little bit expensive, but the quality of the food and the near excellent customer service is well worth it. I think the raw fish could have been a bit more fresh, but since I eat rolls and tempuras much more than raw fish, I would rate the food as 4.25/5.00. Their near excellent customer service 4.75/5.00 is very difficult to find. Total: 9.00/10.00 (why can't yelp allow half stars?!)

You can park on the side street where Mastermind is (parking beyond the first stop sign is free parking otherwise I think its paid parking)"}
{"text":"My Toronto friends assured me that the sushi at this tiny establishment in the city's fringes was excellent and they were not wrong. The dishes we had were all very good indeed and served in a professional manner. They also have a good and interesting range of specialty sushi items as well as non-sushi choices that were well worth having, including a delicious fried chicken cutlet and a marinated mackerel that was singed with a blowtorch at the table and topped with a bit of soy sauce. 

I suppose they may deserve a five-star rating within the confines of Toronto sushi establishments, but when compared with places I've been to in other cities I found that it was not quite there."}
{"text":"Best Japanese (not just sushi) in Toronto. A place run and patronized by many within Toronto's Japanese community and locals in the neighborhood, this small restaurant is difficult to get a table, but well worth it. The proprietor, Tamio, is an artist and one who takes great pride in pleasing his customers."}
{"text":"A name of Shinobu, it brings back my memories of Ninja Gaiden but you Pokemon generation wouldn't know about that.  Shinobu means stealth in Japanese and that meaning holds true.  During the day it is Maki Sushi and at night the Japanese Red Sun curtains drape over the front windows and turns itself secretly into Shinobu by Maki Sushi.

Sunday night we walked inside this small restaurant to find that we had a short wait as most tables of Asian(Chinese, Japanese) couples and families were enjoying their meal.  You can see a Japanese Kid sneaking into a photo.  

I was gentleman enough to sit all night in the spotlight, literally.  I'm not sure why but the inside with simple decor has those bright overhead spotlights aimed at specific places.  I felt like I was a piece of art on the wall at the gallery, but don't worry I'm less expensive and I'm on a rental plan for your convenience, ladies(guys too).  :P

Friendly :) Japanese girls brought us some Miso Soup and plenty of Tea refills.  She even asked us if we're okay with Natto since not everyone is aware of it's consistency and texture.  I need to put on my forehead \"I eat EVERYTHING\".

Goshiki Natto ($7.50) is beautifully presented as you're familiar with it from most Izakayas.  If you're not familiar, then think of it as a Fish Tartare.  I find this A-OK nothing special and for some reason most places don't give Wasabi along with this anymore.

Volcano Rainbow Roll ($8.90) seems to be the must-try item here and it's always great to have a server bring a big blow-torch towards you.  It is used to singe the top which consisted of Avocado, Tuna, and Honey Sauce.  The top items melts in your mouth then you get the beautifully cooked shari rice coming apart with every bite and finally the last is always the Cucumber fine juliennes that refreshes your palette.

Sashimi Tray(Chef's Choice $18.90) came with a bowl of rice on the side.  Fresh and each piece seemed to showcase the Fish's natural texture especially with the Tuna and Hamachi.  The Mackerel was slightly cooked and didn't taste as fishy compared to other places.

Matsu Sushi ($18.90) had equally good quality expertly prepared.  Some pieces even had Shiso inside in addition to Wasabi or Ginger topping.  Definitely worth the value in my books as I try to awake my friend from her sushi dreams.

Half the Menu was the Tapas items which we didn't try out, so maybe we'll leave that for others to comment.  Overall a beautiful end of the night as I got out of the spotlight into the clear cool night."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my experience here, but I can't quite give it a five. We made a reservation for seven people. They put us at a four person table. I ended up sitting on a chair right on top of an air vent that was blowing air up my back. Not a fun starting experience. Another table cleared out, and we got moved to that table. Thankfully, that one was for six people. Service for the rest of the night was quite pleasant.

Had: 

Beef yakiniku salad ($9.50) - Tasty. Beef was tender. Not worth the $9.50 price tag though. Small portion.

Shimesaba ($12.50) - Seared mackerel sashimi. Good portion for price. Blowtorched at the table. Mackerel is salty to begin with, but they have soy sauce on the side, and they also serve it with a generous amount of green onions and ginger. 

Supreme assorted sashimi ($35) - Had about 20 pieces. Good value! Great assortment of sashimi. Presented beautifully. Fresh. I'd definitely order this again.

White tuna don ($16) - Tasty. Decent portion for price. Shreds of shiso leaf add an interesting flavor to it all. 

Agedashi tofu ($5.90) - Four pieces. Lightest batter I've seen on agadashi tofu. Tasty. Fresh. Not cheap though.

Toriten nanban ($12) - Full portion. Tempura chicken cutlet with tartar sauce. Super tasty. Outside was crunchy. Inside was juicy. Not the cheapest, but also not particularly expensive. I'd order this again.

Soft shell crab ($15) - One of their daily specials. Tasty, but not particularly unique.

Bluefin tuna sashimi ($15/3 pieces) - Another daily special. Didn't taste it. Looked fresh. Decent portion.

Seafood yakisoba ($9.50) - Smaller portion than I'd hoped. Very tasty though.

Tonpei yaki ($9.50) - Egg omelette filled with pork and cabbage. The egg was just cooked and the entire thing was delicious. I'd definitely order this again.

Honey chicken ($6.50) - Small pieces of chicken in a terriyaki/honey-esque sauce. Tasty, but small portion for price.

Negihama roll ($6.90) - Chopped yellowtail and scallions. Eight pieces. Softest sushi rice I've ever had. In a good way. Super delicate. Quite tasty.

Volcano rainbow roll ($10.90) - Torched rainbow roll with honey sauce. I've had torched rolls much more expensive than this, and the quality on this one was superior to those ones. Bang for buck? Prolly. Torched at the table. Honey sauce makes it so much better. I'd definitely order this again.

Matcha cheesecake ($5.90?) - Came with a choice of black sesame, ginger, or green tea ice cream, if I recall correctly. We had the black sesame. They served the good kind. A lot of places have grey colored black sesame. This place has the black kind. It's stronger in flavor. Yum. I don't know whether I enjoyed the ice cream and the cheesecake together, but the black sesame was on point, and the cheesecake was tasty.

tl;dr:

pass: honey chicken, negihama roll (Pay more. Get another volcano), softshell crab, bluefin tuna (Had it once before. Would rather get another supreme assorted sashimi), agedashi tofu, beef yakiniku salad.

maybe: matcha cheesecake, seafood yakisoba, white tuna don, white tuna don, shimesaba.

definitely order again: volcano rainbow roll, tonpei yaki, toriten nanban, supreme assorted sashimi.

Final thoughts: Not a cheap sushi place, but good quality makes up for it. Tiny place, so make sure to make a reservation. Grandpa started by saying this place was dilapidated, but his final thought was that it was the best Japanese meal he's ever had. Cute."}
{"text":"my favourite sushi in town with great price and absolutely gorgeous food!!"}
{"text":"Specialty: Authentic Japanese
Dining Experience: Dinner
Menu items: Salmon Sashimi, Seafood Don, Hotate Rolls and Spicy Tuna Roll

The unpretentious 20 seat restaurant on the Yonge strip is right to make claim as one of Toronto's best sushi restaurants, or maybe I am the one making the claim. Either way, this place competes head to head with famous Toronto restaurants such as Yuzu, To-ne and even Guu Izayaka!

Shinobu's selection of sashimi is best described as fresh, flavourful and beautifully sliced. From the salmon to the tuna, this Japanese restaurant stole my taste buds away in blink of a bite!

The Seafood Don is a perfectly assembled bowl of sashimi sitting on a bed of rice, sprinkled with green onion, soy sauce and fish eggs. From white tuna, to scallops, salmon and shrimp, the assortment of fresh fish on a rice bowl is a must order at 

Playing on the scallop tune, which to me was probably the best sashimi symphony of the day; the Hotate Dream Roll truly portraits the knife skills and expertise from the chefs at Shinobu. The roll consists of spicy salmon mix wrapped with avocado and topped with thin slices of scallop and salmon roe (aka salmon eggs). Yum, yum, yum.

And because to me there is no such thing as too much sushi, I couldn't help but also give the Spicy Tuna rolls a try, which are basically a similar take to the Hotate roll sans the scallop. The ingredient that gave a whole new taste to the otherwise traditional roll, was the sesame seeds, socking up all the flavour and moist from the rice and slowly releasing it back in one's palate. Another mush order at Shinobu.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana"}

{"text":"3.9****

The first thing that struck me was the quaint, well, downright tiny interior of this little sushi restaurant. I came here with 2 friends for a late dinner after Karate. We were seated and handed the menus to look over. 

This was the second little surprise....the prices. They were much steeper than I had anticipated, but I made do and ordered away. 

The food took quite a while to arrive...I imagine the preparation for such quality food took a bit longer than I'm used to.

-  The Mt. Fuji Salad was a nice size including some radish and cucumbers, but it was the dressing that blew me away....worth $5.90
-  The Edamame was quite mediocre both in size and flavour....not worth $5.90

-  The Udon was flavoured well and you got what you paid for.....$7.90*?

The Rolls:
-  The Volcano Rainbow Roll was delicious and the blow torch was a unique experience (nice little gourmet touch :) This seared the salmon, tuna, eel, and white tuna giving the honey glaze an extra something. The inside of the roll however, was a little underwhelming containing only avocado and shrimp tempura.
- The Double Shrimp Roll was larger and came with at least 10-12pc rolled in sesame seeds. It had a thin lettuce throughout which added a nice crunch to the flavour.

Overall, the quality of the rice was top notch, but the rolls were not filled with enough fish for my liking. They were $9.80 per roll.

The Sashimi:
-  I was delighted by the assortment of sashimi presented but the waitress informed us that they had run out of steamed rice :P (it was quite late and they actually stayed 30mins after closing time until we left). They allowed us to an extra little spicy salmon roll instead!

-  The mackerel was delicious, and both the salmon and tuna were melt in the mouth fresh. Everything else aka. yellowtail, whitefish..etc were sliced thinly and were OK, at least they were super fresh, just not my favorite....there wasn't even any Butterfish!!!! ......definitely not the best bang for your buck for just under $19


Bottom line I loved the flavours and freshness, but for the prices charged here, I require a more elaborate experience."}
{"text":"The sashimi lunch set for ~$14 was pretty good, very nice presentation with tiny bowls for each item: miso soup, rice, sashimi bowl (incl salmon, tuna, white fish), tofu, eggplant, 3 california rolls. 

Tonpei Yaki (okonomi/pork & egg Japanese pancake) - recommend this, sweet sauce & moist egg"}
{"text":"Best omakase meal tasted so far in Ontario."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner.Good location, between Lawrence and York mill subway station on  Yonge St. The staff were really friendly, english is definitely not their first language, but none the less the service was very good. The food was really good and at a fair price compared to the other sushi places. We ordered\" \"Toriten Nanban / Chicken tempura with tartar sauce\", the chicken was crispy and with no fat, which I hate a lot. White Tuna Don, really delicious dish with rice and Double Shrimp Cannon Rolls. So far is one of the best of sushi restaurants I have tried in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been here twice already. Will go back every time I crave for authentic Edo-style sushi

We ordered:  Supreme Assorted Sushi &  Supreme Assorted Sashimi & some side dishes

I definitely recommend to Edo-style sushi lovers, (note here: not westernized sushi lovers). 
The fish quality is good. 
The rice has not disappointed us so far, as it is an important ingredient in sushi.

I give 4/5 because the side dishes can have some improvements. But up to the restaurant owner. I'm very satisfied with the sushi itself, so I will go back regardless."}
{"text":"Any tour of GTA sushi is incomplete without a stop at Shinobu-- this is easily some of the best fare in Toronto, with quality, fresh pieces of sushi, and a great marriage of traditional and creative rolls. It's my new go-to restaurant, and I'm not easily impressed when it comes to sushi. :) 

BTW, don't leave without eating the Volcano roll-- you won't regret it. ;)"}
{"text":"I had never heard of Shinobu prior to this visit, and it was only in joining a group of friends that I even came here; I was beyond impressed. Shinobu is a small, unassuming restaurant that if you blink, you just might miss (despite its red sign) - nothing special about it from the outside. 
But after sitting down, the experience from beginning to end was phenomenal. We ordered the scallop roll, the (ever popular) volcano roll, toro roll & salmon sashimi. We also ordered the deep fried halibut, the \"chicken tempura\" (not what it's called on the menu, but how it's described), grilled squid and shrimp tempura. 
I'm glad the toro roll came out first, because everything after that was just so much better! The ponzu sauce that accompanied the deep fried halibut was the perfect antithesis to the grease that typically defines \"deep fried\". The volcano roll, torched at the table, was amazing (thanks Yelpers for the recommendation!) The shrimp tempura was not your typical tempura, but pretty good just the same with a sauce and some tomatoes... The chicken, though... THAT was the highlight of my night. There's something about the sweet/savoury sauce of the chicken and the combination of the tartar-ish sauce that comes with it that just makes this dish AMAZING. 
But the icing on the cake was, of course, the service that took this experience to 5-stars. There was always a waitress nearby, ready to fill tea or ask for help choosing a sake... Fantastic all the way around!"}
{"text":"Didn't realize I didn't leave a review for Shinobu. 

We frequent this restaurant when we want some good sushi midtown. We love coming here for the shimesaba and I order the supreme sushi set often. The price is reasonable for the quality of food and service you're getting. Reservations are a must (especially on weekends) as its very small and serves 6 tables (2-4) at a time. If you plan on sharing dishes with your group, I would recommend coming with groups of no more than 4 (unless everyone plans to just order for themselves)."}
{"text":"I will drive from anywhere in the city to eat here. When I moved downtown from Yonge and Lawrence I still have never found anything comparable. I hope Chef Tameo never moves back to Japan! Toronto needs him."}
{"text":"My dad was at a meeting and my mum wasn't in the mood to cook so she invited me to Shinobu. This place is T I N Y so I would highly encourage you to make a reservation. The menu is pretty compact, but it's a good place to go if you're just craving some Japanese food. They have lunch sets, but the dinner menu seemed to have mostly sushi sets and other non-sushi items a la carte. 

We ordered a number of small dishes and I would recommend them all:
- Nasu Dengaku (generous portion)
- Nanban Chicken (small size was perfect for 2 people)
- Ebi Mayo
- Yakiniku Salad

Shinobu is close to home so I'll definitely go again when I'm in the mood for Japanese, but not in the mood to travel downtown.

Good for: Japanese, sushi"}
{"text":"This is a good place, and probably would give it 3.5 stars.  I think it's been a bit overhyped though and it can get pricey depending on what you order.  This is a small restaurant that fits probably about 20 people at once.  Be sure to make reservations as it gets busy even on a Tuesday evening at around 6:30-7pm.  We made reservations on the same day and luckily got a spot for two, but I noticed that all the other tables also had \"reserved\" signs on them.

The service was friendly and attentive, always making sure we had our tea cups filled.  The food/sushi was fresh. However, I wasn't a huge fan of the salmon aburi/pressed/torched sushi as the rice fell apart very easily.  It also could have used more flavour.  Also, the fried chicken was okay but somewhat greasy. It's essentially fried chicken using batter that seems like tempura batter.  Their torched volcano roll was decent as well, but if it wasn't for the \"torched\" part, I would say it was mediocre. I'd say that my fave dish was the spicy shrimp tempura. It was crispy and had a spicy yet tangy mayo coating it. Total came to about $45 per person but we probably could have been okay without the half order of fried chicken as we were quite full by the end of it."}
{"text":"First time customer, came here first week of Sept 2014.
The food was good and fresh. This is the first place in TO where I finally got traditional Japanese green tea, other sushi places server you Chinese. I ordered Agedashi Tofu which tasted great and didn't have that old-frying-oil smell. Nasu Dengaku (eggplant appetizer) with miso sauce was really delicious. Hotate Dream Roll was melting in my mouth, not spicy at all. Their rice is really good. I also got tuna roll, but didn't like the quality of tuna. It was a bit mushy, but I didn't expect great quality for that price. I found the prices very reasonable, even on the cheap side.

Reservation is highly recommended as the place is extremely small. The table are really close to each other and you can literary share food with neighboring customers. Because of that privacy is out of the question, you can easily join the conversion next table.  A lot of people mention that the decor is non-existent, but forget to mention just how WORN DOWN the place is. The light-colored seats on the chairs are covered in old spots, I hesitated sitting down. The walls are banged up and in need of a fresh paint. Black linens on the tables are the only nice touch. Washroom is really clean too.

I might come back because their tea really moved me and they have interesting dishes I've never tried, but they have to fix their place (change your chair seats to a darker fabric; fill in wall dents and paint - not expensive at all!!!)"}
{"text":"Original owner sold out. Used to be great. Now just a frozen fish sushi all you can eat quality. Sushi rice completely bland and tasteless. It used to be our favorite sushi place to go. Unfortunately not anymore."}
{"text":"***Warning:  This review may be a bit skewed as I went on a Friday, after work, was tired, and had to drive to Kipling, park, and take the subway to this restaurant.***

First of all, reservations are a must, especially if you're planning to visit on a weekend for dinner.  This place is small, seating less than 25ppl, so call ahead!

The Good:
-  lotsa variety on their menu that you won't find elsewhere, re:  Salmon Yukke, a seared salmon tartar (although I didn't taste any 'searing')
-  if you order green tea, they'll supply a full teapot's worth - at NO CHARGE!  So no asking for refills
-  lotsa variety in terms of different cuts of fish in Sushi Entrée, it won't be salmon, salmon, & more salmon!
-  according to other reviews, the entire staff is Japanese, i.e. authentic
-  I think they make their own desserts.  We ordered Green Tea Cheesecake w/ Ginger Tea Ice Cream, shareable for 2, and light tasting!

The Not-So-Good:
-  a coupla nigiri pieces were a bit fishy, in particular the red tuna + a white, oily fish (mackerel?)
-  table wasn't cleared off immediately, but at the last possible moment, re:  once the next dish arrived.  Chopstick wrappers remained on table for the entire meal.
-  very dimly lit, especially if you're seated at the window.  Their main window is covered by a heavy, opaque curtain which allows 0 light, no candles or lighting fixture above tables
-  aside from the sushi rolls, prices are a bit higher than other places that I usually go to.  It's less than Japango, but it ain't cheap!

Service:  Pleasant and polite, but again, plates, chopstick wrappers weren't cleared off immediately.  I even had to lift up an empty plate so that the waitress could place an incoming dish.  So it's more relaxed service as opposed to fine dining.

Not a fan:  This has nothing to do with Shinobu, but I wasn't personally a fan of the Goshiki Natto Don.  I guess I didn't know what I was getting into, but it smelled like rotting food, but tasted bland.  I didn't know if I was supposed to add soy sauce to it, but that's what I ended up doing.  It's supposed to be good for you, but I don't think I'd order it again.

I may visit again if I was ever in that area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to deal with the traffic/find street parking!"}
{"text":"We've been here on three different occasions, and all three occasions we were satisfied. Definately do try the volcano roll, it's their most popular dish and rightfully so. The premises is small, roughly around 100 sq ft in the dining area, so make reservations!"}

{"text":"Suuuuper yummy sushi! !!! We tried a few rolls and the sashimi plate.  The raw fish was very fresh and tasty. The roll with yellow tail fish and green onion was very delicious. The highlight was the vulcano sushi roll which they put on flame!! Also my favourite shrimp tempura came with an extra sauce on top of it. It was lil spicy but definately worth to try! They also serve homemade soya sauce! For dessert we had japanese green tea cake with black sesame ice cream...yuuuuum!! 
The place doesn't have to many tables, reservation is highly recommended!!  All in all it was a wonderful dinner!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favourites in Toronto a few years ago, but it is only above average now. Sushi is still fresh, and recipes are still good, but it feels the actual execution is no longer superb. Come early for specials, it's still worth a visit :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my family for the first time.   We lived in Japan a few years so we are always looking for very authentic Japanese food.  This was definitely one of those places.  The volcano rainbow rolls were delicious - must try!  We also had a half order of their signature dish - Toriten (fried chicken) which was so good.  We also got the sashimi lunch set which was a great value w/ 2 sides, salad, california rolls and soup for $13.90.  Be sure to make reservations since this place is really small.  Also, note that they are not always open for lunch."}
{"text":"Effectively, 3.9 is the most appropriate mark for this good but not  woaaa flabbergasting place.

Staff is nice.  A little bit of decoration would improve the experience."}
{"text":"4.5/5

The menu is a conglomerate of authentic sushi and Izakaya or tapas-style dishes. The authenticity cannot be overstated. This is the first sushi place I've been where both the restaurateur and clientele is Japanese. Most importantly the food tastes good and is of great quality.  

I have to say that I didn't expect much from such a tiny, informal and reasonably priced place but it impressed me quite a bit. I took the recommendation of Yelpers and tried the Volcano roll. I wasn't disappointed. The waitress torched the salmon at the table. It was quite the spectacle! The negihama, yellow-tail with green onions, had a distinct taste to it. My friend had the supreme assorted sushi, which was top-notch in terms of presentation. The spicy shrimp tempura was hot and crispy without being greasy. I also had a couple of rounds of Shochu on the rocks, which I've become fond of lately. The one they carried here had a very crisp bite to it. I would recommend the grapefruit cocktail to anyone.  It comes out with hand juicer and half a grapefruit. 

I would definately return here. I hope they continue doing what they're doing."}
{"text":"What better to write about Food that I love the most for my 600th Yelp review. (BTW, this is also my 1st anniversary review since I wrote my first ever Yelp review on November 11, 2009 when all these Yelp Madness started!)

Yes I love Japanese food, especially something that is authentic. Not traditional but authentic in the spirit of the art of Japanese cooking! 

In the sense that the chefs spends a lot of time and effort to: 
- try to buy the freshest and the most seasonal ingredients 
- perfect the process of food preparation 
- paying attention to details 
- make the presentation a work of art 
- understand serving the end product with people that appreciated is their goal 

Shinobu Sushi is really the ONE! Love the small, intimate set up. The chef is the one that prepare every single order which ensure that everything that Shinobu serves are up to his standard. 

I have to say the sushi rice is the best I have in Toronto. That alone blow my mind away. Now I don't really want to eat those crappy rolls/sushi in other places... don't tell me that it is the same as AYCE. 

The Volcano Rainbow Roll ($8.90) is so awesome. I know using the blow torch is something more westernized but it does give the roll a really complex taste... 

The quality and the cut of the Sashimi is amazing... and with the fresh wasabi..(thanks GOD no tube thing!) oh so melt in your mouth orgasmic experience! (gee I don't believe I wrote that!) 

The price is reasonable so compatible to other Korean/Chinese Sushi place I have been too. Extra +1 stars! I hate pretentious places that charging people stupid prices for their food!

Shinobu Sushi is one of the few Japanese restaurants which I will say \"I AM IN!\" when someone ask me to go for dinner!
