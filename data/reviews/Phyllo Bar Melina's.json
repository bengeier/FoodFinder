{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for an affordable, but good place to eat, and we found exactly what we were hoping for (and more) at Melina's. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the loveliest two women- they were so friendly and genuine. We ordered the spanakopita, a Greek salad, the Melina sandwich, and two hot chocolates. They could not have been better!! The owner was raised Greek, so this was real, authentic Greek food. I have never had a better Greek salad in my life. The sandwich was absolutely amazing too! As we sat, we chatted with the owner and it was clear how passionate she is about food and this restaurant. To top it all off, the hot chocolate was delicious and everything was pretty cheap! They even waited while my boyfriend went to an atm to grab some money (they take Canadian debit and cash, but no credit) and then gave us recommendations on where to go for some great beer and bagels. Could not have had a better experience! If you're looking for great food at a great place, do not miss this!!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place!! What an amazing owner!! I was in Montreal for couple days and i visit Melina's and I loved it!!"}
{"text":"Je viens de découvrir et je confirme que le phyllo épinard fêta est super bon, je reviendrais pour goûter les autres!"}
{"text":"I just returned from Greece and searched far and wide for good phyllo...it was surprisingly very difficult to find an offering better than Melina's tiropita and spanakopita. The rest of the menu is also marvelously delicious: the fresh and tasty Greek salads, the classic frappé ice coffee, the array of greek sweets done so masterfully with an expert nod to the greek flavourscape. If you're in Montreal, don't let your taste buds miss these delights while sitting on the patio and do some the best people watching in the city!"}
{"text":"Amazing, welcoming service that makes you want to go back just to say hi! The Greek salad is the best one I've found in this area by far and is not expensive at all. If you can catch a freshly cooked full meal such as the Greek lasagna, those are also definitely worth bringing back home (and you should stack up on them and freeze them!) Great quality for the price, try it!"}
{"text":"Its fine.  Tiny place. But love the local flavor.  Cute place with lovely staff.  I tried the Baklava.  I have had better.  Cappuccino was nice.  Yes - I would stop by if I walked by and needed a coffee boost."}
{"text":"Formidable minuscule resto.... Attachante proprio.... Surtout délicieux: Prassopita!
À bientôt!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Had the phyllo with ricotta and mozarella and it was great. My boyfriend had the Melinda sandwich, which was very flavorful. Small menu, small restaurant, but very friendly staff and great patio."}
{"text":"Great Phyllo wrapped pastries.  Honestly never knew what phyllo was till I came here, but wow.. these were good.  My favorites were the Spanakopita (spinach and feta)  and Brougasta (custard sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon).  The owner is super chatty and cheerful."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the Outremont area, I always make a point to stop by this cute little hole-in-the-wall: most people usually go for the spanakopita, but the prassopita is the one phyllo pastry that has my heart and soul. Take a bite and the fragrance from leek and onions are to die for.....dagnabit, I already got one this morning, but I might just pop in again before they close!"}
{"text":"REALLY GOOD PASTRIES. This is a small, quaint shop selling a limited but very good selection of Phyllo-wrapped pastries. There are other offerings but every visit, for me, ends with my walking out of the place with several delicious pastries in my hand (I always pick-up / take-away). There's a small counter as well as outside bistro tables ... when weather permits."}
{"text":"There's nothing much to add about this place because everyone's already said it. It's delicious food, the service is excellent, the people are friendly, super affordable, etc....

I've had most of their pastries as well as the spanikopita and the ricotta and feta cheese phyllo. 

Try this place ASAP!"}
{"text":"Super endroit à visiter à l'heure du déjeuner!! Les thyropitas et les spanakopitas étaient impecs! Le feuilleté était léger sans etre trop gras! Parfait pour déguster le matin accompagné d'un freddo! J'y retourne à coup sur!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they first opened. All their \"-pitas\" are amazing. Very similar to what you get in Greece. Ohhh that bougatsa is sooooo good."}
{"text":"What I tried I liked - a lot....

Looking forward to being in the area so that I can pop in again!"}
{"text":"Classic tiropita and spanakopita as well as the sweet Bougatsa. Add a frappe coffee and you're all set."}
{"text":"Melina's is always such a treat! I've tried just about everything on the menu and can confidently say that ALL of the food is incredible. Not to mention, the location is killer! Great vibes in the restaurant and such an awesome team!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem on Parc Avenue. Blink and you will miss it. I have heard about this place for a year or two and just never made it out that way. On the way home today I told my mom that I wanted to treat her to a tiropita or spanakopita. She asked for a keratopita (meat pie) but it wasn't on the menu. 

I ordered 3 cheese pies and one bougatsa.  Since they were to go the lady serving us asked if I wanted her to cut them into bite size pieces. Great idea. Since I ordered the bugasta I was offered the choice of cinnamon or powdered sugar I choose both. She was happy to oblige. 

On the way home my mom and I dug into the pies and damn. They were good. My mom is super picky about tiropita. Most places make them so thin as if feta costs a million dollars. Melina's wasn't cheap with their feta. 

The bougasta was AMAZING. I devoured that and I'm not even gonna pretend I didn't. 

I will make it a point to stop by anytime I am in the area. 

Good luck to the owners on a cute, unique, and very GOOD phyllo bar, something Parc X was seriously lacking."}
{"text":"Looking for delicious Greek Spanakopita (Spinach Pie), Tyropita (Cheese Pie) or Bougatsa (Cream-Filled Phyllo) in Montreal?  Head over to Phyllo Bar Mélina's, a unique place at 5733 Avenue du Parc (corner Bernard) Trust me, they are f..... delicious and Add a frappe coffee and you're all set :) I've known Joanna, the owner - (Yes she's Greek) since a kid but recently found out she owns this place :) Joanna & Staff are SUPER friendly. Happy to see childhood acquaintances do well :)"}
{"text":"The kind and chatty staff at Melina's make you feel instantly welcome - and help you make some well-educated choices about which of their delicious phyllo treats you'll want to take home with you or eat on the spot. 

The Spanakopita is a personal favourite (and it's almost always fresh from the oven), but don't rule out the Melina's special sandwich or the delicious (and huge) greek salad. Top it all off with one of their many imported greek soft drinks or an espresso and you'll be all set to tackle your afternoon."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC little neighbourhood spot. Slow down as you approach its blue signage because it can easily be missed as you walk up (or down) Park Avenue. I got the ricotta phyllo...which was quite heavy but VERY good. These things are big, so bring someone to share it with! THEIR COOKIES ARE TO DIE FOR. SERIOUSLY. Honey cinnamon (or something of that nature) was devoured within a minute of gobble time. Chocolate chip walnut, same deal. Getting hungry again just thinking about them. Soft and chewy, just the way I like my cookies. But go for the phyllo experience, of course... OH and the girl who served me was so sweet and adorable. HIGH rating for her!"}
{"text":"J'avais ajouté Melina's à mes favoris depuis un moment et avais très hâte d'y aller, fait que vu que j'étais dans le coin, j'en ai profité. 

Première surprise, la place est minuscule. Je dirais max 6 places assises et la place a l'ai Jam packed! En rentrant, j'ai vu un vieux monsieur grec qui buvait un café en mangeant un biscuit et en lisant son journal - selon moi c'est un bon signe quand les vieux du quartiers s'y retrouvent plutôt qu'à un des 70 autres cafés grecs dans le coin!

J'ai commandé un trio pour emporter: Une salade grecque, un Phyllo au poireaux et une bouteille d'eau (+/- 13$) En plus quand j'ai fait mon \"check-in\" avec Yelp j'ai eu droit à une deuxième Phyllo gratis(!!) j'ai pris la spanakopita. 

Mes impressions:
La salade grecque.. je dirais que c'était ordinaire. sans plus.
Le Phyllo au poireaux, j'ai bien aimé.
Le spanakopita.. délicieux! Le ratio feuilleté / épinards était parfait. J'y retournerais pour ça! 

Le service était super aimable et courtois et elle m'a même fait goûter à leurs biscuit au pépites de chocolat. YUMM! La prochaine fois, c'est clair que je m'en prends un."}
{"text":"Every time I've grabbed Spanakopita from here it's been still-warm. That alone is remarkable and the flavour, size, and price of these hot flaky little bundles of joy puts them way over the top into heavenly. Too salty is the usual downfall of Greek savoury treats, because of all that cheese, but these are light and buttery and just perfect. The place is cute as a button too: highly recommended."}
{"text":"The spinach phyllo is out of this world!!! Can't wait to return and try everything on the menu!!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the Spanakopita! Staff super cute and the cappuccino is soo good."}
{"text":"I am a little obsessed with their spanakopita.it is just like in greece.it is served warm and they cut it into small pieces to make it easy to munch and give you more time to savour the deliciousness.I've tried almost everything on their menu and will keep coming back.this is the cutest greek bakery in montreal."}
