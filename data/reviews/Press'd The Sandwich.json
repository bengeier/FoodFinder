{"text":"This place is awesome!  I have been here several times and am always happy.  The staff is outgoing and remembers me.  I always have the tuna luna with a diced baby dill pickle, trust me it is incredible!  Someday i may try the bigger sandwich, but i would need to be really hungry;)  I live in the SE but continue to drive up north every couple of weeks to get a great sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and wraps. The soup is fantastic. In December they had a pulled turkey with stuffing, cranberries, and gravy press'd on white bread ... really what could possibly be wrong with that sandwich? It was amazing!!! Highly recommend this restaurant for eat-in, (extremely clean) take-out, and for catering. Have ordered for up to 40 people five times in the last two months. Food is delivered on time, always fresh, well presented, and there is plenty of it. Has become a go to for office training lunches. Will accommodate GF, Dairy Free, etc."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Let's start with the staff. He was friendly asked if it was my first time which it was. He said we are alot like subway (not even close) but I've been told not to say that. Heard him repeat this to 3 other customers. 

I ordered a Cubano.  It was ok. Very small. And a kids grilled cheese. He forgot the kids grilled cheese. I had to reorder after sitting down. After I paid he said oh kids eat for free on weekends. He was not very prepared said it had been a long day even though they had only been open 3 hours. 

The kids grilled cheese was terrible.  Cheese wasn't even melted. I make better grilled cheese at home. 

I won't return.  Save you're money and go to subway or another reputable place."}
{"text":"Came to press'd on a whim.  
Tired of all the junk food surrounding my daily life.  Press'd is a healthy option.
Two different sizes.
Today I had Tuna Luna.  I'm sure I'll come back.
Everyday of the week there is a Sandwich of the day.   5$ for  that regular sized sandwich.  Not bad.
You can add soup or Salad to your meal.  This place kind of reminds me of Subway just better food."}
{"text":"Wonderfully new and refreshing little sandwich shop!
If you're sick of the normal chain sandwich shops then this place may be what you're looking for. Super busy during weekday afternoons and more approachable on weekends. 
I've tried the Club Press'd which was really good, I do wish they'd use real bacon instead of microwave bacon. The broccoli salad is so delicious!
I've also tried the Gobbler, which is my favourite! The flavours are of a Thanksgiving dinner. Hoping it's not a limited sandwich but fear it is. Get it while it's here!"}
{"text":"@pressdsandwich is a no frills sandwich company.  I stopped in here for a quick lunch and quick they are!  My sandwich was made in less than 3 minutes from ordering, not bad.  I ordered the special, The Cubano, pulled pork, ham, chimichurri mayo, provolone cheese and dill pickle.  I chose the rye (they bake their own bread in house).  It was an alright sandwich.  The flavours were a bit competing with the saltiness of the meats and then add to that the salty dill pickle, I would've liked to have had the pulled pork to be a bit sweeter.  The sandwich was pressed (as the name conveys) but it also was a bit crumbly and broke apart.

I would have to say it was a 3-star sandwich and a 4-star experience.  I'd go back again to try out one of their regular menu items."}
{"text":"Didnt taste terrible. But wouldnt choose to go back. Tryed it due to having a groupon however service was terrible and slow. Lots of confusion over everything including how to use the groupon. Completely underwhelming quality and taste. Would probably go to Subway over this and I dont even like Subway all that much!"}
