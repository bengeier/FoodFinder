{"text":"We went with another couple for our anniversary. We paid full price, which was definitely NOT worth it.  Pop/Soda/tea....if it was included in the price...no one was serving it. Just water and coffee at the table.  I paid for 2 cocktails.....just to get through it.  Too long...too much dialogue, not enough acting. Too much work required that really didn't lead you to solve the murder.   If you are thinking \"Clue\" it is nothing like that. Which was disappointing.  Also insulting: WAY overpriced photos, they should have been included in the price especially in our world of Selfies.  Overall, we wouldn't recommend it. Too overpriced, Too long, too hard to follow. Too much work, not enough \"fun\" and tedious detective work that was not relevant.  The funnest part was one  of our party was a suspect. Inside jokes made that our personal highlight.  Should have opted for a comedy club instead. First and last time for a Murder Mystery dinner.  If we could get our money back, we would."}
{"text":"It was better than staying home....but. Arrived and no one told you where the appetizers were, or directed you in the beginning. The actors were energetic and fun but not professional. The 4 course meal was appetizers, salad, entree, and cheesecake. The show is slow paced, and our table was starving by the time the entree arrived. It was fun, maybe a bit pricey for the quality and quantity of the food, but overall glad we went."}
{"text":"We had so much fun when we went last weekend for my friend's birthday! It was so much fun to work with each other and make friends at neighboring tables. It was, however, kind of a bummer that only one person was able to win a prize. We would have appreciated a certificate! The sense of satisfaction solving the mystery was awesome."}
{"text":"Save your money and go to dinner and a movie! This was way overpriced for the value. The food was not good. The only thing that made the night worth while was being with our friends and having my husband get picked as one of the suspects."}
{"text":"We attended the Valentine's Day performance of the Dinner Detective.   The food and service were above average and the portion size was good.  Cash bar was pricey.  The performance was a bit confusing and hard to understand.  The venue is a room about 40 x 50 with a 25 foot ceiling.  The echo was garbling the speech.  More than once I was asked, \"what he say?\"   The timing for the sparse humor was ruined.     There are 6 tables of 10 and there are actors mixed in.  We were encouraged to mingle and ask questions as everyone is a suspect.  A suspect for a crime that hadn't occurred yet.   I really did not understand what I was to get from that part.  Once the crime was committed, the 2 detectives came in the questioned some guests/actors.  Once they responded you could tell who was who.  I suppose if there were some people who had done this before they could have been more \"shady\" and the actors would not have been so apparent making the outcome less obvious.   At the end, there was an envelope to tip the actors, but no mention of tipping the wait staff.   I won't go again, but it was something to do.   Groupon price $50 each."}
{"text":"My whole family attended this event last night. We are originally from Hawaii where we do not have things like this, so we took the opportunity to go while we were vacationing in Arizona.   It was AMAZING! The actors were in character the whole night and it was fun and interactive, giving you clues and food in timed increments throughout the night. All together it was a three hour dinner, but it went by so smoothly, I didn't even realize that much time has passed. At no point was I overly stuffed and by the end of the night I was full and teary eyed from laughing so hard.   I highly recommend this show!"}
{"text":"My story is same as others.. came due to a Groupon, and was intrigued and yet hadn't my hopes up. I learned something this evening..  Food. Absolutely terrible. I knew that I wasn't going to get any decent meal, and this was totally understood. But whoever caters to this place needs to be replaced. If they were smart they would have let someone (anyone) like olive garden cater, because it kind of suits the masses. This was just sad on many levels, when the best part of the meal is the dessert and that is a once frozen big piece of pudding pie.   Drinks.  They have wine, beer and drinks. They are a bit pricey - but nothing that wasn't expected. No complaints here.   Entertainment. I knew it would be cheesy, but it was quite bad. The acting is nonexistent but I can forgive this for peoples enjoyment - but the plot is bad. I mean to the point that they could (and should) have bought a plot somewhere that would been entertaining and also interesting. This is the most boring plot. Absolutely boring. Way more than the poor actors CPR attempts to keep the interest alive.   Audience participation.  I expected some audience participation, and yes there was some. There couldn't have been less.. and the little there was, was dumb. Having had some experience in the realm of entertaining - using the audience should be a given and absolutely free entertainment. Something this venue could have used for sure.   Summary.  For being an amateur entertainment mystery dinner, whoever created this should go back to their day job. I see so much room for improvement in all areas, due to the idea is a good one - but the planning and the execution is sad. Now I need to check out others like this, because I need to reassure myself that this is a low water mark. And again, the plot was ludicrous and not in a funny way."}
{"text":"This was the worst Murder Mystery I've been to. The plot was extremely weak, same for audience participation. I expected the night to be cheesy and it was, in a fun way (hence the reason for me not giving this 1star).  The compare was very good but most of the other 'actors' need to improve.   The food was extremely bad (not that I was expecting a lavish meal) but they had run out of starters so half our table never received them. The chicken consisted of what could be described as 'a bit more than a wing' and the meatloaf was cold in the middle. As for the solution, 1 person apparently solved it (out of around 80 people) how, I'll never know as the 'murderer' was never even in the performance ?!? Whether this was a try out for a new scenario or tried before it should definitely be changed. There were 5 reasonable suspects that could have been selected on any different showing with different explanations to the clues and logic."}
{"text":"Awesome show and had a great time. Dinner isn't served until about 815, but was actually really tasty for hotel food. There was great energy in the room and we had a fun table."}
{"text":"We had fun at this show, although it would have been more fun with a large group. We were placed at a large table with a nice family (except for the racist dad) but they had their inside jokes and kept talking over my husband and I, thus difficult to have conversation with this setup. Our backs were also to the action in the middle of the banquet hall. It was a bit disorganized at the check-in table as well. No one told us to do a nametag until we were called out and embarrassed for not doing so. Then, we didn't know that you were supposed to give yourself a fake funny name and just wrote our own names. Lame.   The storyline was pretty cheesy but I appreciated the audience participation, with the exception of the ice breaker-esque activity going around to interview other guests. The food was \"meh\" and we did wish there was a drink other than water or coffee provided. Booze helped ease the slight cheesiness and we had an enjoyable night out. The staff was friendly and the lead female detective was very funny and great with impromptu comedy.  Don't think this would have been worth full price but we had a great Groupon for the adventure. Everyone was casual/business casual and it would not be a child-friendly show. Cash bar."}
{"text":"One of my favorite movies of all time is Clue so I've wanted to do a dinner mystery theatre for as long as I can remember. I want to give it 3.5, but couldn't. It was a fun experience and you actually do have to think in solving the crime. Hope for fun people at your table because they can make it better. We had a fun table and they made the experience more enjoyable than what it would be.  The food isn't good. That's the worst part of it, hands down!  The dessert was semi-enjoyable. The chicken was dry but my friend liked the meatloaf (to a degree) . We ended up going to dinner after.  The run time is about 3 hours, but time went quickly with all the breaks. Overall, I'd say go and give it a try, but be prepared to eat after. You'll be entertained."}
{"text":"Probably the worst expenditure of time and money ever.   Both the meal and performance were underwhelming. For all of the mid/positive reviews it seemed worth the risk, but in the end NOT at all.  The story line, if there was one, is never really revealed so we left feeling confused.    If you really want a mystery and dinner, stay home on your couch and watch CSI, this was not worth any effort or $$"}
{"text":"What a great evening with our company. I would highly recommend coming to this to families as well as just couples."}
{"text":"We got a groupon deal and decided to check it out.  The entrees had 3 choices but they did accommodate my special request for just plain baked chicken and steamed veggies which was cool.  Water and iced tea were free everything else you had to pay for.  We were sitting over by the bar and the prices seemed to be more like a sporting event opposed to a dinner type setting.  Oh and it was a cash bar.  The show was a bit cheesy at times but was way more interactive than what we expected.  I was singled out as one of the suspects which gave my wife and I pretty good laugh.  All in all we had a good time.  We were seated at a table with 6 random strangers so a larger group of us would have been fun. The show is mainly in the middle of the banquet room so if you want to see what is going on I suggest you pick a seat that can see that way.    If you are expecting CSI or method acting this is not the venue for you.  If you want to get out for a couple hours, laugh a little, and have a decent time then give this a try.  If you can find a deal on the ticket price definitely try.    We would do this again."}
{"text":"My bf and I bought a Groupon with another couple and the night was very entertaining.  It was kind of hokey and drinks are expensive, but it really was a good night out.  I would recommend going with a small group because I think that enhances the fun factor.  The food was relatively good - not the best but certainly not the worst either (I got the salmon). I would definitely recommend if you can find another Groupon deal -- I'm not sure how worth it the show would be at full-priced"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money!!! We had more fun at the dueling piano bar down the road. I have been to many murder mystery dinners , and I will say this dinner detective show was the absolute worst one I've ever seen. Total waste of time and money could not wait for it to be done. Daughter and son-in-law were in town they were excited to go  because They have  never seen one.they will now never go to another. Food was absolutely disgusting,and the show wasn't any better. We went to check them out to hire them for the work Christmas party needless to say that will not happen with these guys..."}
{"text":"We honestly did not want to come.  But for some reason I had bought a groupon a year ago and was just gonna let it go when I decided to go ahead and give it a try.  It turned out to be a whole lot of fun.   I think if you go with a group of friends it would help up the fun factor.  The dinner was nothing really to write about, it was very forgettable.  We were late so we missed appetizers, and everything else was just okay.  The entertainment is where it was at.  It was cheesy at times, but I think that is what is all about.  Some people you can tell are the actors among the audience but I think they did that on to confuse you.  My husband was chosen as a suspect and had to re-enact a killer killing someone with a chain saw.  Quite a few people thought we were the killers because we came in late.  I didn't figure out who the killer was and apparently only one person in the whole place did.    I did have a great time, but without a discount I don't know if I would have tried this place.  I do think its worth trying at least once for those who never did a mystery dinner thing."}
{"text":"Based off the reviews I wasn't sure what to expect, but I went to last night's performance and it was hilarious! I seriously busted out laughing on multiple occasions. The food was pretty good too. I read in a different review that they changed locations to get better catered food. Good call! :) I would definitely recommend it! And I might be buying gift certificates as presents!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed. It was fun! The food was mediocre else I would have given 5 stars. I'll go back again for sure. Loved the actors!  Update 21 feb 2013. Apparently they moved to Marriott to improve their food. That's great!"}
{"text":"We bought Groupons with friends for this (ours were actually a Christmas gift from our kids).  We made our reservations and received confirmation that it was at the Marriott Mesa which was great since we are in Mesa.  The night of the show came and we went to the hotel in anticipation of a fun night only to find out they had moved out of the Mesa Marriott about 2 months before.  We never were notified of the change and they had our e-mails and phone numbers.  We have been trying to contact someone about this and have had no luck in anyone returning our calls or e-mails.  I understand their no refund policy but this was not our error.  I feel since they pulled out of the location we were given they owe us either a refund or seats to a different date but after reading some of these reviews I don't think I would like to see this show.  Very poor customer service and I would NEVER recommend this to anyone.  We will continue to phone and e-mail until they finally get tired of us and communicate with us.  Save your money and avoid frustration.       2-27-16 I must right a revision to my original review.  After a few e-mails and phone calls we finally were contacted by Vicki, the Associate Producer, of the Phoenix location.  She was very apologetic and understanding and issued gift certificates to our friends and us.  She even made sure we were able to attend the 2-27 show since our friends will be leaving the area on the 29th.  We will be attending tonight and are anticipating a fun evening.  Thanks to Vicki for her attention to our problem and honoring our original reservation.  I can't give it a better rating yet as we haven't actually attended yet."}
{"text":"How Horrible can it be.....Well let me tell you.  The food was uneatable and that is putting it nicely.  It started with no appetizers, we were told  they were served before we got there. We were in line when the door opened, so I guess  you had to be REALLY early! The chicken entree was so dried out you had to tear it apart as you could not cut it and then you  could not eat it. The asparagus (3 spears) were boiled to death (maybe this was the murder and where the detective was needed), the twice baked potato had been baked and baked and baked and then reheated until it was shoe leather. The carrot cake dessert was dry and by then we were just tired of the whole thing.  The acting was something my 5 and 6 year old grandchildren could do impromptu and lacked sooooo much to be desired.  It truly was an evening to be remembered.......... REMEMBER YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS EVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"It's a good thing we got groupons for this and didn't have to pay full price. Bottom line is that it's not worth the experience.  Don't come hungry to this event...they feed you very little, and the food itself is cafeteria grade.  The breadsticks were stale, the eggrolls were soggy, and the main dishes were terrible: the salmon was overcooked and dry, and the sides were simply steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes likely from a boxed mix.  The other main dish, stuffed chicken, was also dry, and the stuffing was a mixture overwhelmed by creamed cheese. The highlight of the meal was a dessert was a chocolate cake that was moist and creamy.  The show itself was somewhat entertaining, if you're willing to dumb down your humor and lower your overall expectations.  Many lines in the actual show were stolen from popular movies, so they were funny but unoriginal.  The story dragged on for too long...started at 6:30 and ended at 10.  Dinner wasn't served until about 8/8:30.  The host took every opportunity possible to point out the bar in the corner, which charged $8 for a mixed drink or cheap wine.  I've always wanted to try one of these detective dinners, and now that I have gone, I won't ever go back or recommend it to anyone else.  Maybe it will entertain a group of children, or a group of conservatives who think that these things are an adventure. Even with the groupon deal, this \"show\" wasn't worth the money.  Save your cash and go to vegas for a real show, or go try a couple of quality restaurants instead."}
{"text":"Wow...that all I really have to say about Dinner Detective. I really did not want to come here. My wife had bought a Groupon over 1 year ago and we finally got a chance to go. I kinda had no choice.lol. Well, I'm actually glad I did! Not what I expected. They really got the crowd into it and I was even called to play a game and became a suspect. Super fun and I totally didn't see it coming. At the end you probably will be shocked to find out who the killer is but that's the fun of it. Very fun!   The food was average, but I didn't come for a fine dinner..it served its purpose. Coffee was tasty though.   I'm really glad that I came for DD. it was much more fun than I was expecting and I would recommend people going."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this, but the storyline was pretty terrible, and most of the clues were hidden in these long handouts (some of which we didn't even get). The audience participation component was pretty lame, too. The characters just weren't really developed, and the actors for the most part relied on silly slapstick humor, bad puns, and sexual innuendo. It was hard to take it seriously. Just not up the level expected, especially considering the cost (even with the discount) and the fact that there's a dress code. The food was okay, though--not great, but not terrible."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to a Saturday night show (thank you, Groupon), and while it was certainly different and interesting, I had some problems with it.  But before we get into that, let's talk about the good stuff.  The food was decent (standard hotel selection).  We were served two appetizers, a salad course, dinner entree, and dessert.  The coffee, by the way, was delicious!  The whole thing takes place in a typical hotel conference/banquet room, and the actors are mixed in with the regular guests.  So there's no real way of knowing who is an actor and who isn't.  While on the surface, this format was fun, I'm not sure it's the best.  Which leads me to the bad stuff.  Throughout the show (which reads more like a comedy than a murder mystery), the two main actors (the detectives) call on people to \"interrogate\" them.  But really, they're either picking on actors to shove them in your face as suspects, or they're giving stage time to guests who had paid extra for special packages.  Either way, it was annoying because at the end of the night, there's no real motive or connection for you to solve this mystery.  Speaking of solving the mystery, \"evidence\" is presented as handouts that guests are meant to read throughout the dinner.  Probably not the most effective way to do this.  Half the time, things were not getting passed around, or everyone was too distracted by dinner to really connect whatever clues they're hoping to spotlight.  My verdict?  We managed to guess who the killer was, but this was due to us figuring out who the actors were.  It had nothing to do with the evidence.  I would have enjoyed the show more if the show actually had more substance.  But for what it was, I think I would have rather gone to see an Improv Comedy act or musical show."}
{"text":"Dinner detective was so much fun!! I haven't laughed that hard in a long time!! The detectives were hilarious. I highly recommend that everyone do this!!"}
{"text":"Have dinner and solve a murder. Great way to spend an evening. Very entertaining and well thought out."}
{"text":"Was a lot of fun! I like that they get he audience engaged and keep you guessing the whole time. The food wasn't bad, but not a very big portion. I laughed the whole time and met some interesting people. I'd go again and encourage you to go too!"}
{"text":"Went to the show on 8/25. The food sucked, the show itself i was expecting more. For the price i paid even with a groupon it was too much, if i wanna see crappy acting ill go see a kristen stewart movie. It was really the audience that makes the show not the actors. Next time ill just do my own murder mystery"}
