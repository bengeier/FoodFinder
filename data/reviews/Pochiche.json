{"text":"I'm very happen to have a vegan option in the area! Finally a place to grab an inexpensive dinner with my vegetarian boyfriend in Montreal West. The Putty Butty (wrap with French fries in it) is surprisingly good - the fries are made fresh to order and the selection of ingredients for the sandwich is good.  I recommend the (vegan) mayonnaise sauce. My brother is not a vegan or vegetarian and he really enjoyed it too. The restaurant is very clean.   I think this restaurant will improve a lot with time, as the menu right now is rather limited and they are still getting the hang of things."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed by it at all. Store bought pita and cheap ingredients."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy, tasty food served in a bright, clean space by friendly, pleasant staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am shocked that people would review it so badly. We only moved in the vicinity in March 2017 so can't vouch for any earlier experiences. I have never eaten in but have always found the decor and cleanliness above par. In terms of food itself , me and my wife love the eggplant and falafel wraps respectively. The salad and sauces they add make it rich and fulfilling.  The staff is very polite and spend a lot of time making each wrap to perfection.  However if you are looking for sophisticated food with a lot of variety , this is not the place for you.   One night we found it closed to our utter disappointment and tried another very famous falafel place nearby. The place was full and rocking but we didn't enjoy the food as much."}
{"text":"Used to go here sometimes, but I have recently found that the whole vibe and food have changed dramatically. I have found the staff to be polite and courteous in the past, however recently, I have noticed them to be slow, rude, and honestly a little creepy! The falafel balls and fries are very good, but the bread is dry.  Although this restaurant has some redeeming qualities, I would not recommend you \"go there!\""}
{"text":"I'm very happy to have found this place. I have been there a handful of times in the last month. The falafel is very fresh, tasty and not too oily. Good flavour, and I love that they add coriander and mint to the wraps and salads. I don't like the pita bread. The last time I was there it was quite dry. Not stale, but dry. The fries are amazing!!! No other way to describe them. I really like the fatouche salad, but they sometimes put too much dressing and I personally would prefer the onions cut a little smaller. The staff is very welcoming and friendly, but sadly very slow. If they ever had a busy rush I can't see them handling it quickly. I don't mind waiting sometimes, but there is always a wait and rarely more than 2 people in the restaurant. As a vegetarian I'd love to see this place succeed. As a huge falafel fan I'd love to see this place succeed. I'll be back, but they have some work to do."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice, there's no frying smell to stick to you clothes. After that the eye catching display of salads and add ons to your Falafel sandwich! I picked all dressed. The taste that strucks you straight at the first bite is fresh mint, so yummy, opens up one's apetite. Then the freshness of the veggies, not too cold not hot like other stores, but enough to feel the difference with the falfel chickpea pieces it's like eating a salad with in your sandwich. The Falafel tastes amazing can't feel the oil neither the heartburn effect after (yes i waited to write my complete review)  Fries and onion with the vegan mayo-sauce, they're as tasty as they look perfectly shaped and crust holding amazingly to each one. Zero feel of burned oil by the way. The waiter was super friendly and welcoming had a nice chat and I was offered to taste (mock grilled chicken, mock grilled ginger chicken and mock beef) if i couldn't tell the difference you won't. Very high in Protein for those of you workout freaks like me!!! Go try it it's worth every bite!!! Cheers"}
