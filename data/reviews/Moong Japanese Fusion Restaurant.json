{"text":"The staff are all very friendly, but the sushi was pretty good! Everything seemed to be extremely fresh. My friend ordered a sashimi platter and she mentioned how the salmon sashimi tasted almost like butter.  I ordered the Toronto roll and it was better than I expected. The shrimp tempura in the roll was still warm and crispy. The size of the roll was quite big. I was definitely full from eating the roll itself. The rice was also warm, which was perfect!  I also loved how they cut the cucumber in the Toronto roll. They were very thin, small slices of cucumber, instead of chunks.  I highly recommend this place!  They also have a small patio!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place?   The quality of service and food have deteriorated over the months. In the past I left the restaurant satisfied with the delicious meals and the courteous service. Now I feel as though they should pay me to eat their food.  Slow service. The lone wait staff is overworked and has troubles attending to all the tables. Sushi and maki are so-so. Salmon dish was very greasy.   Moong had so much potential in the beginning. I'd hate to see it go down."}
{"text":"Moong is consistently amazing. Wish they were bigger but completely understandable, those guys behind the counter are artists!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good quality!  No need to go down to Bloor as much now.  Friendly, polite service as is usual in sushi restos."}
{"text":"Have been there around 10 times and not giving five stars just because it doesn't have some more options as brown rice sushi or more soups.  This restaurant is very good and affordable  I'd take someone for an invite or even a date.  In the summertime they open the Terrace which is an extra benefit compared to the other sushi options nearby."}
{"text":"Good place - I like their standard sushi and I really really like their specialty sushi. They have this one that I think was called a Hawaiian role. Definitely try this!"}
{"text":"The food was decent but not exactly memorable. The unagi on a hot plate, tuna maki,  and sushi combo (I forget what was in that) were all fairly middle-of-the-road in taste but a bit on the high end in terms of price.  Service was good but we were the only people in the restaurant.   I'm not sure exactly what makes this place fusion. it seems to be just Japanese and Korean food like so many other sushi joints"}
{"text":"Sushi is absolutely fine but the price is not. No lunch specials on weekends which means the only sushi set on menu (with tempura) is $16."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food and service has always been excellent.  I recommend the Hawaiian volanco roll - personal fave.  The spicy seafood udon is also excellent value and very tasty.  They also have a nice little patio should you want to get some sun."}
{"text":"The food was served quick and was great. I was a bit worried because this place was empty but when we left it was full.   Great presentation and service, the waitress was really polite and attentive.   My two favourite items were Spicy salmon rolls and crispy asparagus rolls."}
{"text":"Very happy with this restaurant. I ordered the sushi and tempura bento box. The tempura was standard, nothing wrong with it. The sushi was next level. Very fresh fish on perfectly cooked and seasoned rice. The fish was balanced very well with the rice and cut generously. You could tell they were not trying to rip you off with a paper thin slice of fish on a huge wad of rice like all of those all you can eat sushi places. The bento came with delicious miso soup, crispy salad, 2 fried dumplings, tempura and 8 huge peices of sushi. A bargain for 16.99. I will definitely be returning to this tasty restaurant."}
{"text":"I reviewed Moong 2 years ago, just after it opened.  From a rocky start, it has really improved.  The sushi is now spot on, made order by order, the selection is great, and the service is excellent. I only wish they had more seating."}
{"text":"Excellent and innovative sushi. Great neighbourhood spot.....friendly and attentive staff. Beautiful little restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the bulgogi and beef udon. In both, the beef was terrible (almost unchewable in the soup). Flavour was bland and unpleasant. Very expensive for bad food. I won't return and I would recommend you avoid it. For sushi in the same neighbourhood try Nama and for Korean there are many to choose from a few blocks south on Bloor."}
{"text":"The food here was ok.  The Gyoza was horrible.  Sushi was good. Service was ok but could have been better.  The one big thing was the ventilation.  We were there for an hour and after we left our clothing smelt like grease and Gyoza.  I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"I had been a regular customer for a couple of years before moving into a different neighborhood. This is a good local sushi restaurant with a versatile and affordable menu, decent quality food, and pleasant service. They've got a good selection of appetizers, fresh sashimi, and a good choice of rolls. I love their Spicy Salmon and Scallop maki! Inside the place, there are few tables for eating in; they also do deliveries and takeout. Deliveries are always prompt and never disappointing. Overall, this place is worth visiting and ordering from."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch while we still had an hour on our parking ticket, seen the reviews on yelp and it was across from where we parked. It's a cosy corner Japanese restaurant with a lot of character, food and service was exceptional. So mannerly and polite. No pressure to rush the order, they let us take our time to sieve through the menu and when we were ready I just gave her a glance and she came along. Sweet woman. We were served green tea in a pretty little teapot and our orders just kept coming while we ate, which was fine. We chose to sit by the window to peoplewatch as we ate..  we ordered 2 appetisers or Gyoza which was delicious and at a very reasonable price I feel for what you would pay for grease at foodstalls  .. presentation for all was beautiful although isn't all Japanese food honestly?  For our mains we ordered the teriyaki salmon with rice and the bento box sashimi with tempura which was also delicious. Left full and happy.  Toilets are past the till, downstairs. Provides delivery and takeout as I seen on the outside of the building.  Not sure about wifi. Hope that helps anyone looking for some sushi/good Japanese food. Please don't hesitate to go in here, it's a cosy little corner restaurant that makes good grub!"}
{"text":"Amezing food whoever speak bad about this restaurant is never been here , also the owner is a really friendly guy aswell as the servers. A+++"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, fresh sashimi (we ordered the 45 piece), the maki we also ordered was delicious.  Service was quick and friendly.  A little gem!"}
{"text":"Moong is one of my favourite local spots. I come here regularly and service is always very friendly and attentive. It's a small joint but they recently updated their patio. Which is amazing to have, especially on a hot summers day.  Though their prices are a bit higher than your average Japanese restaurant, their sashimi quality they serve here is worth the price. Versus other restaurants that offer a cheaper price but terrible quality. Quality is always better than quantity when it comes to sushi. I absolutely love butterfish. Theirs is always a pleasure. I recommend ordering it if you want to branch out from salmon. It is fresh and delicious.  For those who want a deal, it is better to come here during lunch when they offer their lunch specials. I would recommend their chirashi for lunch. It comes with a miso soup and a small salad. I really like the dressing they use for their salad. It is sweet and tangy. Not your typical mayo or tomato dressing they normally put at other Japanese restaurants.  They offer bento boxes here also, but they are typical that come with a side miso soup and salad. There tempura is always good to order here. It is light and crunchy! There kalbi beef is filling if you feel for cooked food. Though you do have to order rice on the side as it doesn't come with it.  Which I still find odd. If you want cooked fish, I'd recommend their grilled eel on rice. It's a simple meal with good flavors. You can't go wrong with that if you are unable to decide.   I have had their sushi boats. The 32 pieces is good for two. They are very accommodating when it comes to dislikes. They will opt it out, no questions asked.  Overall, this is a destination where I will continue to go back. They are always consistent with their food quality and service. It's a friendly and local spot that I would be happy to recommend to anyone.  4 stars for Moong!"}
{"text":"Good neighbourhood spot with friendly service and lovely (albeit quite small patio).  Not worth a specific trip but if you live in the neighbourhood definitely delicious.  Sashimi dinner had only three kinds of fish (mostly salmon, some tuna and some other almost seared fish?), the pieces were almost TOO thick?!  The wasabi was the right amount of actual spice which I love because I hate weak-ass wasabi.  The interesting thing was I ordered ikura nigiri (one of my favourite foods) and the waiter didn't have faith I actually wanted that!  he repeated it back to me and then again made sure before he left, \"The big salmon roe?\"  haha I guess they don't get a lot of white folk ordering that?!  But it was DELICIOUS! So many roe!  I would go back if i was in the neighbourhood! wish the sashimi had more fish-selection.  Apparently great for take-out."}
{"text":"A very good sushi place with friendly service and fresh food. I had the chirashi sushi, and it was gigantic. I couldn't finish it (though I don't eat a ton of rice, anyway). We also had a big dragon roll, that could have had something to do with that.  The ambience is comfortable and modern, and the service really is friendly. I'd be back."}
{"text":"The service was good and the food was decent but not great.  It seemed a little pricey for the quality and location.   Seeing as how there aren't a ton of sushi places in this area, it's a good local option.   If you're willing to venture out, Sushi Inn in Yorkville or Sushi on Bloor are better for both value and quality."}
{"text":"Fast service, and has the typical bento box, teriyaki, tempura, soup and salad menu. This place has better house salad than most Japanese restaurants I've been to. Really relaxed atmosphere and staff is really kind."}
{"text":"Excellent. Loved the banana roll and especially the tuna love roll.   Best surprise was the beef bulgogi. It was some of the best I've ever had.   Reasonable prices and nice place."}
{"text":"If you have a hankering for sushi and really need to eat immediately, Moong will do. We came here on a Saturday afternoon, around 2:30pm, so it was wonderfully empty. My company and I were a little ambitious with our appetite, so we ordered three rolls each. Which was a mistake. Things to take notice: - The rolls are huge, uncomfortably huge. So, I got full quick, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But I had a hard time munching comfortably on those big sushi suckers. - The innards of the rolls tasted like cold. I think this was more true of the vegetable rolls, maybe because it was mid-afternoon and not a lot of guests were expected that the vegetables were put in the fridge and not taken out to defrost? Either way, because it tasted of cold, the rolls in general lacked in depth of flavour. I had better hopes for Moong, maybe I caught them at a bad time. Maybe."}
{"text":"This place opened up a couple months ago and it has been truly a heaven sent! My boyfriend and I usually like to get our fill of cheap but satisfying sushi from Sushi on Bloor, which isn't particularly close to us. Since this place has opened up, we've completely abandoned Sushi on Bloor. Moons' sushi is slightly more expensive, but it makes all the difference in the food's quality--it's SO much better."}
{"text":"It's a bit on the pricey side but the quality is great and the presentation follows suit, even for takeout. I've gotten takeout from this place numerous times and everything is always fresh. There's just the right amount of rice in the rolls and it's always fresh, sticky, not too firm, and not too soft. The tempura is just the right crispness, never soggy. All in all great quality, and most of the time that's worth the extra dollar!"}
{"text":"The food here is exceptional! Even the salad they served us (for free!) was nothing like I've ever had before.   I ordered a salmon teriyaki bento box with expectations that it would be very small but I was pleasantly surprised that the box was gigantic and I was so full after I finished eating it.   The only thing I would complain about is that the wait was very long which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. It took us about an hour to get our food and the restaurant was very small and not even busy at that time."}
{"text":"A short walk from our home, I'm shocked that we haven't visited this place sooner. We aren't extremely adventurous when it comes to \"trying\" new things (yikes!) because once we truly enjoy a restaurant, we become regulars aka furniture at the place. However, we haven't been \"sold\" on a sushi place yet..so we decided to venture off and try Moong, WHY NOT?  I was surprised at how small the inside was but to be honest it was cozy and comfortable. We were attended as soon as we sat down with some yummy tea and our waitress was extremely friendly.  We got an order of the spicy chicken which is accompanied by soup, salad and rice. We also got an order of the chicken teriyaki lunch bento box which comes with shrimp and veggie tempura, soup, rice, salad and edamame.   The spicy chicken was tasty (and spicy- go figure) but I personally wouldn't order it again..but my beau quite enjoyed it. The salad was so delightful. It had a roasted sesame type of garnish that adds such a unique flavour to it. I honestly would order a large bowl of salad if that was an option (is it?)  My bento box was amazing, I just wish there was a little bit more variety with the veggies. They had a lot of squash but if they mixed in maybe some mushrooms or broccoli, it would keep the taste buds a little bit happier. I love how the chicken wasn't over cooked and dry, it was actually moist and yummy.  Overall,  it was a great experience and will certainly be back for more : )"}
{"text":"Usually a big fan but the last time I ordered it took 2 hours to come to my house. Not happy. Stick with dining in."}
