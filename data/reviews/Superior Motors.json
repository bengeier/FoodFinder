{"text":"Amazing service! Checked in on a Friday night and the place was packed. Service at the bar is in credible. I have several food allergies and our bartender was very knowledgeable. I ordered the Beef. It came with greens, a corn purée with goat cheese. The beef was perfectly cooked. My friend and I ended the night with not one, but three desserts! We tried the Smoked Chocolate, Sourdough Pound cake, and Pavlova. While they were all amazing I recommend the Sourdough Pound cake."}
{"text":"We loved our meal and the ambiance at Superior Motors. The wait staff was friendly and helpful. The cocktails perfect.  We will definitely return even though we live on the other side of the city."}
{"text":"Disappointing. We attended the prix fixe on New Year's Eve - 5 courses with an optional alcohol pairing. The first course was excellent. The second course was very good. The third course was also very good, though missed the mark by having puffed pastry that was flat. The fourth course was lobster that was ruined by an excessively salty lobster reduction. The final course was baked Alaska, again, ruined by too much kirschwasser and ice cream so hard it couldn't be cut with the spoon. The service was very good and they offered us a second dessert of a citrus tart that was better than the poorly executed baked Alaska. I appreciated that the alcohol pairing included wine and spirits. However, we spent $400 on an inconsistent meal accompanied by fruit flies that we and the other couple across from us were also fighting off."}
{"text":"Over rated.  I know, I get it.  Braddock, the next up and coming neighborhood in Pittsburgh.  Small plates with big prices and they don't match up the quantity.  Maybe this is just a yinzer who just really wanted a meal on a sandwich, but there is something wrong with $33 for pork belly.  Good effort on trying to up the game of culinary in an early gentrified area but you missed the mark.  One redeeming quality?  The service.  Knowledgeable, not afraid to tell you what sucks and what doesn't"}
{"text":"Unbelievably good. An amazing atmosphere and great food!  It was a totally incredible experience dining in an incredible space.  The food is fancy, but good-sized portions and tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"I do not usually review, so please forgive.  We sat at the bar for dinner and drinks.  Jeremy and Nick were very professional and informative in our first adventure at a new restaurant! Thank you both!   We had the octopus, scallops and tartare to start, and beef and pork for entrees.  Everything was so amazing and we had very high expectations.  Favorites were the tartare, pork belly and the steak, but all delicious.  Drink menu was stellar.  My partner in crime started with a local ipa on draft (he was driving, so I got to taste more), and I had some of my bartender's creative cocktails.  Vodka w tomato water was delicious and refreshing.  Mezcal also intelligently created and so good!  Far drive, but worth it!  We live in the East End but will  be back.  Side note...they really are not that expensive and the dishes were priced well.  We are just pigs and overstuffed ourselves."}
{"text":"I can't say a single bad thing about our dinner here.   Got the tartare and skate apps (both awesome), the cavatelli (good) and lamb (incredible) entrees, and the panna cotta dessert (fantastic and I don't even like dessert). The mezcal cocktail is a standout, as well.  Service was incredible -- our server, Anthony, is reeeaaallly good at his job. And at the end of our meal the GM, Chris, offered to take us into the kitchen and show us around. We chatted with him for a bit back there and had the opportunity to tell Kevin that our meal was an all-timer. Top to bottom genuinely great hospitality.  My wife and I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Finally got here tonight and was not disappointed.  We had an early reservation and were able to park in the small lot next door. There is plenty of street parking available as well.    The interior is cool.  Exposed brick, high ceilings, clean lines, open kitchen. Nice bar.  We did not find it to be overly noisy as others have mentioned, and the music playlist was great and loud enough to notice it but not intrusive.  Very cool vibe to the whole place, from the decor to the staff.  Front of the house were great - friendly, warm and welcoming. Our server Caroline was excellent.   We ordered drinks from their cocktail list that were good.  I got the \"Rye\"...Wild Turkey, Blackberry and chocolate mint.  We were told that the entree portions were \"not overwhelming\" and that a starter was recommended, which we expected after reading reviews here.  I ordered the chilled tomato soup which was refreshing and very good, with a definite spicy kick.    Our entrees were the beef, lamb and pork.  I ordered the pork and it was perfect. And those potatoes....I can't even.  SO delicious. Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  I tasted both the beef and the lamb that my company ordered.  They were both melt in your mouth and delicious. All three meats were cooked to perfection.  The accompaniments were thoughtful and interesting. The plating is visually appealing. And we thought the portions were good. For a man with a big appetite, maybe not, but with a starter and dessert, maybe.   We finished by sharing the smoked chocolate and sourdough pound cake desserts. I will say neither of these were the highlights of our experience, but were good.  I couldn't get into the mushroom and the chocolate. I don't feel the mushroom really added anything except for a shock factor, if you will. The chocolate itself was delicious though. I'm not sure what the gel-like top layer was and felt it could be excluded.   A couple of things to change/improve in my opinion.  I ordered coffee with dessert. $5. It was not good coffee. It's also served in a cup without a handle so you're wrapping your hand around the cup itself...the cup gets HOT. Really hot. Like too hot to hold with steaming hot coffee in it.  Ouch.  They also have two window seating areas that are more like lounging areas...would be fine for drinks but would be awkward to eat at.  Think eating off of your coffee table while sitting on your couch.  Regular tables there would be an improvement.   My bottom line - overall excellent. Sublime entrees. Cool atmosphere. Adventurous dining all around. I'll be back. Well done, Mr. Sousa.  Well done, indeed."}
{"text":"With high hopes we made the long trek to Braddock for a disappointing experience. Tables are close together and the waitstaff ran into my chair several times throughout the night. One can understand the random customer bumping a chair, but the waitstaff that negotiates these aisles daily? Cummon! Started with the crispy pig face, recommended as a don't-miss offering by our server. It was bland and uninteresting. I ordered the tuna which had a very nice rice side topped with a poached egg. My dining companions enjoyed their cavatelli (very rich) and arctic char. Wine recommendations were poor. Left feeling disappointed. Worst of all, I had a great deal of gastric distress the following morning. Save yourself the drive."}
{"text":"Somewhere I read that dining at Superior Motors was not about having a meal but rather having an experience. It sounded sort of cliche, especially since it hadn't been announced that there would be a live band or some other form of entertainment. So I couldn't imagine what was supposed to be so experiential until...the people. And by the people I mean Kevin Sousa's team. This is the most amazing, energetic, diverse, people-type people I've experienced in a restaurant or even the service industry altogether. And I love that many of these folks are native Braddock residents! From the hostess to Kevin himself, the team connected with customers and made an experience out of a meal. Such genuinely friendly and outgoing personalities. And did I mention how the food is ridiculously succulent and unique and just beyond...just beyond... When I read the description of each menu item, I wondered who on earth thinks of pairing this stuff together? But once I tasted the food, I was truly amazed, and, being a part of a large party, I tasted nearly everything on the menu!   My daughter who likes anything but the basics fell in love with the octopus and the beef! That's a huge testament of the taste and quality of the food.   And the cocktails...who the heck is Jeremy and where has he been all of my life?! I've hated any form of whiskey anytime I've tasted it but the Rye cocktail with blackberries and chocolate mint (another crazy combination) is one that I sucked down like a sailor. So so smooth and simply delish! I can't say that I'm now a whiskey drinker but I will have that drink at Superior Motors anytime. I'll actually be going back because I'm curious to see if he can deliver on his promise to ensure that I enjoy a Gin cocktail just as much! Can hardly wait to find out.   On top of all of this, and unlike any other restaurant I know of, Superior Motors is investing in Braddock community members through a culinary training program so that they will be a part of building their own community rather than being left behind, or pushed out. This means that you get to not only eat well and drink well but also do well but supporting a business that supports the community.   Kudos to Sousa and his team for silencing the naysayers and delivering on the promise to create a memorable, meaningful experience for patrons."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service and amazing interior decorations! It's a perfect mix of old and new. The manager, Chris, was beyond friendly and introduced himself to our table. And props to chef Kevin Sousa! He's always done amazing things, but this new establishment is his best! My girlfriend left a 30% tip (which she never does) HAHA. Will definitely be returning! :)"}
{"text":"Went with three other couples.  I love to try all the new Pgh restaurants.  We were all disappointed.  Poor wine list and poor service.  Much better restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"This is an upscale restaurant and it mostly lives up to it.   PROS: Easy parking, nice decor, service is what you would expect it to be. Food is tasty but, as expected for a restaurant of this caliber, the servings are small and expensive. Foie gras appetizer was delicious. Venison and pork were both very good.  CONS: Service was slow between courses. They have some seating that is lounge seating which makes it a bit harder to eat. I would suspect most people would rather sit at a table so you don't have to bend over to eat but that could just be a matter of opinion.  Overall, an excellent place to try for a special occasion but not somewhere I'll go back to any time soon."}
{"text":"Where to start..  Lets preface.  I love giving great reviews and I certainly prefer to have a list of awesome places to suggest to friends when they ask, \"Any new tasty restaurants\"?   That is unfortunately not possible with this new Pittsburgh spot.  The front of house staff are very well trained and courteous.  Service is very well timed and the descriptions of the dishes are thorough.  Wanting to get a well rounded taste of chef Kevin Sousa's latest menu, we ordered a wide sampling of starters and mains.  The cast of characters to begin included rice cakes, hamachi, and a crab puree type appetizer.    The crab puree was indeed good and comparable in texture and taste to a seafood bisque.  Unfortunately, it wasn't quite enough to salvage the meal.    The rice cakes were uninteresting and bland, with a sort of sauce I would compare to canned Spaghetti-O's mixed with a tablespoon of chili paste.    The yellowtail (hamachi) was certainly the worst of the three.  Not due to any issue with flavor coherence but simply due to the fact that the fish itself was well past it's prime.    A few other details came to light as we waited for our mains to arrive.  It was very cold on this particular night and while the place does look quite cool (being housed in an old car dealership) this is a case of form over function as the temperature in the all brick/concrete dining room had to be somewhere around 55 degrees.  Mains arrived.    The scallops were good but it would be outlandish if they weren't considering it's a simple caramelizing sear in the pan and onto the plate.  The short ribs missed the mark entirely and didn't have any of the velvety, buttery consistency and texture that these delicious morsels are prized for.  Then there was the whole fish which no words could describe.  Lets try.    It tasted like an Monongahela river carp pulled out a week before and as much as I appreciate local sustainable food, that's not ok."}
{"text":"Very fun and interesting place to dine. This restaurant was formerly one of the first indoor Chevrolet dealerships. The exposed brick walls and huge wall of windows give it a hip contemporary vibe. Love that it sits across the street from the steel mill. So much history. The menu is a bit confusing though. We had to ask the waitress what everything was. The portions are also very small. The wine and chocolate dessert were my favorite. Delicious. Service was great. Fun experience."}
{"text":"Flawless food for those who are open to new textures, flavors, and ingredient combinations.  Environment- SM is set up in the same way as many modern gastropub type environments with clean sharp edges, exposed brick, and modern design elements. As stated in other reviews, I did get confused by the dyson hand dryer/washer but not enough to impact my experience. Music was not too loud in my experience. I was glad we were seated at the tables that were higher level. I did notice some tables being low similar to a bottle service type table which I don't think I would prefer  Food- SM menu lists a few ingredients that the dish contains, but does not fully represent the complexity of the dish you will receive. We ordered two starters, one entree, and two desserts. The starts are 'small' in the sense that they wouldn't be appropriate to share with more than 2 people if everyone wanted multiple bites. The waitress even suggested each person order 3 courses. The entree size is appropriately sized and I would not classify it as small. The desserts were very decadent and filling, so I felt their size was appropriate for the end of the meal.  The flavors, textures, and combinations of ingredients are something you will see rarely in the area. The rice cakes area very different experience, sort of like a more chewy gnocchi in a savory and spicy red sauce. The raw scallops are very decadent and rich thanks to the creme fraiche. The halibut is seared wonderfully with a great crispy potato and purees. Finally, the smoked chocolate mousse and Pavlova were respectfully rich and light ways to end the meal. Only high praise for the uniqueness of the food while still remaining conventionally tasty. Sometimes food from places like SM can be weird for the sake of it, but even those apprehensive about the ingredients contained in any of their dishes would likely still be persuaded once they took a bite.  Price- Considering I don't usually order drinks, my average bill price will likely be lower than other reviews. Still, with 2 starters, an entree, and 2 desserts, the price came out to about 77 dollars. While I can't afford to eat out this way every weekend, for special occasions it is well worth it."}
{"text":"The is the worst place in Pittsburgh you can ever eat at the chef is the biggest asshole ever all you hear is his weird ass screaming service ever two mins who want to eat hearing that the whole time the food is not even that good they don't serve anything other people would like how you have a restaurant in Braddock but don't serve anything people from Braddock would eat I seen someone drop a fork on they floor and still give it to a customer the place really sucks I wouldn't waste my 200 dollars there ever again and I wouldn't recommend anyone else too they are cutting back on the portions of food you get they got you paying all this money for a half of bowl of whatever you get don't eat here I REPEAT DO NOT EAT AT HIS HORRIBLE RESTAURANT"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a long time for this restaurant and I was absolutely not disappointed. I had the Korean rice cakes tempeh, lamb, and sourdough poundcake and they were all excellent. My companions had the monkfish, beef, pavlova and like them, too. The atmosphere is also aesthetically pleasing. Although outside of the city, the drive is not too bad and lovely if you travel by the river AND it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Superior Food In My Steel Valley   Hello Lovers! Finally made it to Superior Motors for a try. Nice surprise date night with the Zombie Lawyer. This was on my list of places to try and I guess I was nervous to...I like Chef Kevin Sousa & I want him to succeed. I'm proud that he invested in Braddock & that he has a commitment to the steel valley. I guess I was nervous because I didn't want to be let down or disappointed--- and I was not!   I have to admit I hang out a lot around the valley, trying to support new & local & reviving steel communities.   I always see that SM has a million cars outside & is busy!   When we came by we put on some nice duds & had a table in the center of the main dining room. Right away I noticed a lot of young kids as runners & staff, this was Kevin's commitment to hiring young local talent & giving them the chance to put a huge foodie stamp on a resume to the culinary world. Even for young folks - we got high end level treatment during our dining experience. Very polished & professional. Very on par with other great restaurants nationally.   Next observation, many old rich people trying to be cool. Hahahaha!  So about the food...   Soft shell crab small plate: Beautiful, delicious & flavorful. Pig face small plate: Wanted to love this, needed just a tad more seasoning  Kimchi Beef: Winner! Fabulous. Melt in your mouth perfectly cooked. Great Balance.  Coconut Dessert: Molecular Gastronomy cool & refreshing.  Chocolate Dessert: Lime did not come through   Floor Manager: you made a \"I'm not from Pittsburgh\" comment about the pretzel Salad desert...remarked \"it is a Pennsylvania thing\" lol! Don't be so uptight and New York you nut!   Bottom line: I'd come back! Great experience! Happy this is an addition to the food scene in Pittsburgh!   Love you! Muah"}
{"text":"Wow. Didn't know what to expect and showed up with a mixed group of foodies and non-fancy folks. The bourbon cocktail was a great starter (we had 3) and our server was so attentive and willing to fill us in on every item on the menu. The octopus starter was delicious, and the lamb and beef entrees were perfectly portioned and tasty. We also really enjoyed the chocolate dessert with mushrooms and the pound cake. The general crowd on the Sunday night that we went was a full range of dressy and T-shirts with cargo shorts and I felt like everyone was welcome and fit in. The chef stopped by personally to check in twice, and our 8 person table all raved about every course. This is an amazing spot for a special occasion dinner, but reasonably priced for date night as well. We will be back."}
{"text":"Things started off a bit rocky when we arrived for our reservation and had to wait, even though there were several empty tables. Not such a huge deal, I used the restroom which was an odd experience as there was no mirror, a weird faucet/hand dryer combination and nowhere to hang a purse or sweater in the stall. The decor of the space was industrial and edgy, but made it very loud (a problem that persisted all evening).  Nonetheless, when we finally sat down and perused, we settled on ordering the rice cakes, the soup and grilled sardines (a special off the menu starter) as appetizers. Order the rice cakes if you can tolerate weird textures, I oddly found the things that looked like elongated gnocchi tasty despite their odd texture and having no idea what they were. The soup was ok, nothing to write home about, and the sardines which were served whole and had to be filleted by us at the table were pretty good.  For dinner, my table ordered the Halibut, Grouper, Chicken and Rigatoni. All three meats were impeccably cooked. There were two purees with the Halibut and I'll be honest, the eggplant puree was just plain gross. The rigatoni was delicious and the sweetbreads with it were seasoned well and are good if eating the thymus of an animal is your speed.   For dessert, we ordered the infamous chocolate mushroom dessert which I enjoyed immensely (I don't like mushrooms and still enjoyed this) and the sorbet, which was also quite tasty and very refreshing.  After our nearly 3 hours service (WAY TOO LONG for a Wednesday) I can say that I would go back, but in no rush. It's evident that each dish is creative and thought out well and everything is on the plate for a reason which I appreciate. Portions were nicely sized. However, the textures of many dishes were unusual. Several things were very good but there were a few that were kind of yucky. If I could, this would be a 3.5 stars..3 too harsh and 4 too generous.  Mom's Review: \"I've been there. But the Cider was excellent!\" (mom was not a huge fan)"}
{"text":"This was truly a unique gourmet dining experience and thoroughly enjoyable.   The chef's dishes were outstanding and the staff attentive and helpful. We will return eager to enjoy the chef's creativity. Though prices are not for the faint of heart, the seven different menu items the three of us shared and enjoyed were worth every cent.   I cannot wait to return"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Well beyond (already high) expectations!  First heard about the restaurant on Anthony Bourdain, and have been waiting, first, for the restaurant to open and, second, for a chance to visit Pittsburgh in order to get a chance to dine here. Yes, it is now an international destination food experience.  The last Bourdain recommendation I tried was a noodle house in Sapporo Japan, complete with its \"Anthony Bourdain Here Eat\" sign on the window. Am looking forward to continue chasing him around the globe.  At Superior Motors we were almost embarrassed by the attention and loved the atmosphere, the wait staff and - last but far from least - the food.  Earlier in the day we had enjoyed an open house by acclaimed Pittsburgh artist Mia Tarducci and immediately recognized her work inside the front door. That painting alone encapsulates the 'grow it at home' showcasing philosophy at Superior Motors.  Chris' wine recommendation was on point as was his strong encouragement to try the chicken. Seriously, who recommends the - cheapest thing on the menu - chicken dish? Only someone that knows you are going to be blown away by it.  The best moment of all was our server's recommendation for dessert. \"I'd eat it off the floor,\" she advised. Ok, maybe not the kind of recommendation you'd expect to accompany food like this. After trying the ganache, though, I agree. In fact, I'd even fight her to eat it off the floor.  A peak inside the kitchen after dinner was also outstanding. Ooh, would it be fun to work in there.   Thank you Kevin and Chris!"}
{"text":"We had made reservations months in advance through Open table.  Our group increased from 6 to 8 a few days prior.  Superior gladly accommodated the change.  The design of Superior is a nice fit for formerly industrial Braddock.  Exposed brick, concrete floors, simple wood tables- industrial hip but not painfully so.   Place was packed.   Cocktails refreshing and  tasty. We had the heirloom tomato soup - green and exceptional with a kick. Rice cake appetizer unusual and fabulous. All of the main courses were outstanding and played beautifully. One note- the bathrooms had a super cool dyson wash and dry faucet in one that our group had a tough time figuring out.  Just start waving your hands near the sink and something will happen! Looking forward to many return visits to Superior."}
{"text":"The Food and Service were exceptionally good for this a \"little out of the way\" , well maybe a \"lot out of the way\"restaurant. But if you enjoy fine dining it is well worth the trip. Its also good to see a forgotten neighborhood on the rise. The Beef Tartare was very flavorful, creatively seasoned and well presented. On my next visit I will get 2 of them. I had the Beef (Hanger Steak) as my Entree, again well seasoned and perfectly cooked. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I had reservations Friday night at 8:15. We arrived a couple minutes early only to be told that it would be a few minutes. We didn't mid too much- it's Friday and we figured it'd only be a couple minutes. We waited over 45 minutes & we got one of the low bar tables. They offered those tables to us when we made the reservation and it was a much earlier time, but we had specifically requested not to have the bar table. Even more annoying, when we got seated we had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the waitress to even come around. It's 9 o'clock at this point, tables are opening up everywhere. There's absolutely no excuse for that. So we are talking over an hour from arrival to even being seen by a waitress. I don't care who your chef is or what you're serving, that is NOT acceptable.   The worst part was the behavior of the staff. The one lady was doing her best to alleviate the situation, but bless her heart it was not working. She told us the reason for the wait was the traffic from the arts festival in downtown Pittsburgh..... the restaurant is in Braddock..... it's 8:15........rightttt. At least she tried. The guy, who I assume was the front of house manager from his interaction with other staff, was so infuriatingly nonchalant about the situation. At first he offered us drinks while we were waiting, but later when we saw the bill they were included. It would've been a nice gesture to pay for the first round since they clearly messed up the reservations. Worse, he NEVER apologized!!! He just said \"well the table we're going to seat you at is eating dessert now so it shouldn't be too much longer\" in a 'I could care less' tone of voice. Other customers were coming up and joking with us about going to another restaurant in front of the staff that's how bad it got. I will admit when we got the food it was good, but there isn't a prayer that I'd ever go back not after we made reservations and still waited over an hour before we even got served. Hope they can fix their customer service problem!!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is lacking in restaurants with solid vegetarian options and unfortunately, Superior Motors follows suit. I always get my hopes up when a new place opens. There is one vegan option and one option which can be made vegetarian by leaving out some of the main meat components. The two vegetarian plates we got were fine, but nothing special for $18 and $19. The one vegan option lacked a substantial protein source and the modified menu item just felt like something was missing (because it was, they left out the meat because I asked them to). The server recommended that people usually get \"a 2 or 3 course menu\". As there were no vegetarian shareable apps, we passed on the appetizers and got entrees and desserts. We were with two non-vegetarians and all together four entrees, four desserts, two mocktails and an ice tea was $150 plus tip.  I knew it would be busy, so I booked a table in advance and no issues with my online reservation. They called three days in advance to confirm. I thought the service was great and our servers and hostess were excellent. As others have said, the inside looks great. The dining room was completely full when we were there and I didn't notice being particularly slow. The plating of the food was just beautiful. Of note, it was difficult to talk because of the noise level. Maybe this is because of  sound bouncing off of the brick? The noise level was kind of like Shadyside Mad Mex on Friday night but without the music. Hard to hear each other speak. One person in our group had a hearing aid and he finally  just stopped trying to participate in conversation because he just couldn't hear what we were saying that was a bummer.  Overall, for vegetarians... I don't think Superior Motors really hits the spot for the cost. I don't mind spending money on good food in a good atmosphere but we probably won't come back here for anything other than a little date night desert. I only live 7 minutes away-but not in Braddock so I don't qualify for the 50% off community loyalty program.    The other thing I couldn't stop thinking about was how expensive everything is for the community that it's in. I know that twice a month, Braddock residents get 50% off... but if they recommend a 2-3 course meal....$10 salad... $28 entrée.... $10 dessert. That's still a $24 meal without a drink. As someone who grew up in an area with a similar economic situation to Braddock, I know my family wouldn't have had the cash to spend $24 plus tip for a meal for one person. I know Kevin Sousa is doing some cool things partnering with Grow Pittsburgh and Braddock Farms as well as the unique, free of charge culinary job training program to locals. Even so, I couldn't help feeling sheepish driving through Braddock.... away from our $175 payment."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking. \"Braddock?? It's sketchy over there and it's too far. Not worth it.\" Oh but that is so not the case. Trust me, you wont regret it one bit. Superior Motors is such a gem nestled in the rough. Truly, I was absolutely blown away after my first bite. Wow. Everything we had here was just outstanding.   I came here during restaurant week so I think my portions were a little smaller than usual (so don't be discouraged by my pictures of such small plates). Because of this, I was able to sample three absolutely phenomenal dishes as well as the full plates my husband ordered. Ocean trout tartare, fried squid, sage cavatelli, beef, and veal. Of these, my favorite was the fried squid and if I had to pick my least favorite, it'd be the veal. Overall, though, each dish was so inventive, intricate, and absolutely stunning.   Overall, Superior Motors is a very well-thought-out restaurant. The whole experience here is definitely worth the trek to Braddock!"}
{"text":"Stay away from this place! Tiny portions of poor quality at a high price. The lamb I ordered was mostly fat with six garbanzo beans on a indistinguishable sauce. You would have to order  first second and third and remain hungry. And I am ok with small portions but that was  ridiculous. Wine was overpriced. It is shame because the location is sitting across the street from a historic Pittsburgh steel mill in a part of town that can use an economic revival. To top things off they brought an appetizer with a long hair in it. The waiter still charged us for it. Not good!"}
{"text":"I was completely taken surprise by this place!! To start off the decor and atmosphere was great! It has that mix of old and new paying homage to what used to be housed here and the neighborhood that it is in. Our waiter Will so very professional kind and knowledgeable on the food and the history of the space. Will suggested on the drink of the week. 2 1.5 ounce manhattans. One post prohibition made with rye and the other modern. The food was amazing! Plates are small so you can order a bunch for sharing. We started off with the soft shell crab and the shrimp tapenade. The Asian inspired flavor with the crab was delicious. Then had the grass fed filet and the pappardelle pasta. The filet isn't  your typical filet and our server told us that up front along with the fact that it's supposed to be served warm. I love servers who give us a heads up on items. The filet practically melted in my mouth! The pasta was a nice light accompaniment to the filet. We ended up ordering the pretzel salad for dessert. We were told by another server ( waitress) Who delivered our dessert that the mulberries were even picked next-door!  Even the girl server assistant/busser was friendly and helpful.  I cannot wait to come back and try more items!!!"}
{"text":"As a disclaimer, the only reason I'm leaving a three star review is because of the service. The food is spectacular and I would recommend suffering the poor service to have the experience. We came in for an early dinner in December for our friends birthday. There was four of us and our bill was roughly $400 which is definitely not inexpensive for Pittsburgh. However, the quality of the food and drink definitely justifies the price. That being said, I assume a certain level of service when I choose to spend that amount of money in a restaurant. We sat around 7:00pm and we were one of the first few tables in the restaurant. We were rushed to place our order when trying to decide between the four of us which dishes we would like to share. After placing our order, we asked for our pasta dishes and entrees be brought out in separate courses. Every course came out at once, despite repeating the request three times for them to come out separate. We also ordered 4 appetizers, only 3 of which were brought to the table. When we had finished the first three and brought it to her attention that we never got the fourth one we ordered her response was \"oh yeah\". It then came out with the pastas and entrees which we had asked to come in separate courses. This all would have been excusable but we were still charged for the appetizer that our server forgot to order and arrived to our table 20 minuets late. Despite all that I would still recommend the restaurant to others. It's just unfortunate because I'm sure that I am not the only one to have this type of experience."}
{"text":"Decided to drive out to Braddock because I loved Salt of the Earth. Despite having reservations, we waited 20 minutes for a table. The bar was full so we awkwardly sat by the door. We have the mole appetizer which was fine, as well as the mushroom and cavatelli entrees (both of which were okay), and the creme brûlée dessert which was odd. Overall I wouldn't return here. There are plenty of better restaurants back in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Happy we made the drive to check out Superior Motors! Chris and I first heard about this restaurant on Anthony Bourdain's \"Parts Unknown\" when they featured Pittsburgh. We both have never heard about and have been curious ever since. When restaurant week approached, we decided this would be the perfect place to try- and we are glad that we did!   As all the other reviewers said, the atmosphere is pretty cool at Superior Motors. It's in Braddock which doesn't have a lot going on, and then all of a sudden there is a steel mill & a super trendy restaurant across the street. It's full of exposed brick and a very industrial feel. Chris made reservations a few days in advance but we still had to wait when we arrived. When I asked if we could wait at the bar, the hostess told me that there is no standing room at the bar but we could order a drink in the waiting area. We only ended up waiting about 15 minutes before we seated in the smaller area of the restaurant. I wish we were seated on the other side- there seemed to be more going on over there.   They only had 2 options for their restaurant week- a meat or vegetarian option. Before ordering, I started with a glass of wine & Chris got a beer and we also got the fried squid- delicious! We both ended up ordering the meat option off the menu. To start, we were served ocean tartar with trout. It came with seaweed to wrap the trout it- this was just OK- it's not something I would really ever order again. The next dish was a short rib (36 hours!!!) that was served with polenta, Brussels sprouts, and mushrooms. There was also a béarnaise sauce that was outstanding. The 36 hour short rib was the standout of our whole experience here! It was truly amazing. The last course was the sage cavetlli with butternut squash. This was pretty good & very heavy- I am glad we only got a small portion! Last, we HAD to end the night with a desert so we chose the chocolate desert that was a chocolate cake with espresso in the middle & ice cream. SO GOOD!!   Last but not least, the service was... meh. For as much money as we spent here (even on restaurant week!) we both wished for a little bit of a better experience. From other reviews, it seems like they were satisfied with their service- so I don't think this is a deal breaker. Overall- it's worth checking out for a unique dining experience. Be prepared to spend a little more $$ than expected!"}
{"text":"i had a tasting menu here .... it was .... very different     ; )    not anything  i have ever had before . The restaurant itself is gorgeous  , but the food      i would say half of it is good and half of it you will need to get yourself used to first"}
{"text":"Would come back here more frequently if I had the funds for it! Amazing architecture inside, beautiful neon signage outside, floor to ceiling windows that overlook US Steel Works across the street, which has a constant flame spurting out from the top of it. Very cool setting.  The food was all delicious. Small servings but surprisingly filling, especially if you save room for desert (which you should). Great, friendly and welcoming service."}
{"text":"This was the most unlikely place, but was a pleasant surprise. Superior Motors is the name of a former business that once occupied the building. I have found that many new businesses in Pittsburgh use the original owner/business name. Unsmoke is the name of an art gallery that is next door to Superior Motors, and another great surprise. Go check it out !"}
{"text":"First visit, 2 and a half weeks after opening.  Service was excellent and attentive.  For was creative and delicious.  The foie gras starter was superb.  I had the beef, which was mouthwatering.  Pretty extensive wine list.  The chocolate dessert (with mushrooms!) was fantastic.  Be prepared to ask questions about what items are on the menu.  There is a lot of interesting stuff there."}
{"text":"Have been waiting to see and experience Sousa's latest dining experience. It definitely lived up to its hype. The food and drinks were all great. We had the cold tomato soup, spicy, tasty gazpacho. It was excellent. Then shared the steak, cooked perfect to medium rare and super tasty, and gnocchi which might have been the best dish of the three! Finished off with chocolate dessert and sumac sorbet. Both quite unique and flavorful. The decor is nice, the wait staff were knowledgeable and friendly. The portions are small, but I prefer that to stuffing myself! I did not come home hungry! I will definitely come back, great place to treat yourself to a very nice meal."}
{"text":"Our reservations were at 8:45 and we were not seated until 9:30. They did give us a free round of drinks while we waited however I was HUNGRY!  There were 4 of us and our bill was $300 and that did not include alcohol. Portions were very small; like the size of tapas. When I asked the waitress how many scallops came in an order she proceeded to tell me everything can be shareable, even a strawberry. What? Maybe this is why I walked away hungry!  The filet and salmon were good, but again very small portions. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, \"Mister B\" posted a fake 1 star review. He is the friend of a competing restaurant owner.  Having said that, this place was probably the best place I've ever dined at anywhere.  I lived in San Francisco and Orange County California for years and have traveled on business (Internationally as well) for decades.  You don't even have to have a refined palette to enjoy this amazing food.  Maybe \"Mister B\" is accustom to frozen dinners or Burger King.  If that's you, maybe you should steer clear of this \"SUPERIOR\" dining establishment."}
{"text":"Simply the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. Kevin Sousa is an amazing chef who has continued to expand his repertoire. He and his staff have thought through a million details and have come up with a restaurant experience that is deeply satisfying.   I would invite you to leave your preconceptions aside. Superior Motors is challenging, flavorful, thrilling and thoughtfully conceived. If you are not interested in being challenged by new flavors and provocative food expressions...save your money and go elsewhere. But if you would like to try bold flavor combinations and an adventure in dining, by all means, don't miss eating here.   The dining room is carefully laid out, and it does not feel crowded. Our server was attentive and passionate. She was obviously well trained and loves her job. We gave her a ridiculous 40% tip and she earned every penny.   Each dish led to some new discovery. Not just, novelty, however, but, gratifying, refreshing and delicious.   So I really miss Salt of the Earth, it was my favorite restaurant. However Superior Motors is...well, superior!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to take out-of-town guests - wonderful and creative food, great drinks, attentive but not intrusive wait staff, really nice renovation of the building, plus a quintessential view of old time Pittsburgh -- with the smoke coming from Edgar Thompson playing against the lights of the restaurant, it made for a beautiful scene. Everything we ordered was delicious and unique. Highly recommend the short ribs and polenta, the octopus was divine, as was the beef tartare. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to finally checking out Superior Motors!   Saturday night had reservations at 8:10.  A lot of empty tables but our table not ready so sit at bar.  No problem, wanted a cocktail anyway.  Sat for a good 7 minutes (several people behind bar and seats still left open)  but no one comes to take drink order.  Finally I flag the bartender over; he just stands there, no \"Hi, what can I get you\". Ordered a Grey Goose martini very dirty & extra olives.  No Grey Goose, bartender said he would never have that on his self, more than a tad arrogantly.  OK, not a fan of Kettle1 but not much choice.  I excuse myself to bathroom to apply lipstick.  Two other women in bathroom tell me I probably shouldn't go in the one stall (there are 2) but I just want to put on lipstick (there is no mirror in the main bathroom. minimalistic urban industrial? This definitely is bad!). I look in bathroom; there is throw up all over the commode & toilet paper everywhere. No, I'll wait. Song about Jesus Christ is playing. Back to bar & drink not waiting. (This is 10 minutes later as I had to wait behind 2 women in BR!)  Drink finally comes & martini glass not even half full (I guess this is standard at a more expensive restaurant) but 3 tiny olives on a tooth pic that had come out of a grocery store bought jar of olives? Maybe this will be one of the best martinis I've ever had; Not, especially for $14.  Maybe dinner will be better?  20 more minutes (which is still OK; a good meal is worth waiting for, right?) hostess comes to seat us... at one of the lounge tables at front of restaurant. (This table had been open when we got there) Tables are about knee high. Is this standard at expensive eclectic industrial restaurants?  Maybe, but we really didn't want to be bending over to eat. This would've been a great area to hang with friends having cocktails but not dinner.  We politely ask for another table (still empty ones) but host (I tell him about bathroom) looks a little hesitant so we say we will eat at bar.  Still OK. looking forward to a great meal. We order, my friend: beef tartare and venison, me: crab, hamachi and mushroom.  Order another drink, this time K1 & pineapple (no cranberry that's not in a gun?) which was another $14.  I guess that's standard for a shot of vodka?  Food comes in good time.  First, tartare, crab and hamachi.  Friend says tartare tastes like fish & doesn't eat much.  My crab is good but very little crab. Hamachi is really good.  Next, venison.  Friend says great taste but chewy?  But the worst is my mushroom.  See pic.  Its burnt (not seared or charred),  the 3 tiny mushrooms on top are really burnt & shriveled. couscous is OK but very mushy, even for couscous. I proceed to try to cut the mushroom but its difficult. I take a bite. Rubber. So not good. When barmaid comes over to ask if everything is OK; she doesn't wait for an answer & I am still contemplating eating it. I decide I'm just going to suck it up & not say anything.  I almost never send anything back.  And maybe, I'm just not the food connoisseur & this is how it's supposed to be; I try another small bite.  No, no better.  When time to clear plates, I guess the barmaid had told Host that I hadn't eaten. He comes over & is very nice & says they will bring me another dish but my friend is done & I'm pretty done.  I say, just buy me a drink. I do not have a problem spending a lot on a great dinner. However, I expect not to pay for the mushroom but when the bill comes, my friend tells me they did not take it off.  I say, \"really?\"  Barmaid  overhears, I think & comes over & takes the bill & takes the mushroom off. I am grateful for this. I leave 20% tip ( I usually leave more).  Bartender never thanks us or asks if we want desert (rude guy). I regret it but I figure it might have to be shared with the other girl bartender. I do know people that have gone to SM & had great meals but I probably will not go back there.  It was just the combination of everything.  But this is disappointing because it has a cool vibe & could have been somewhere where I would go often, based on vicinity.  By the way, went to BR before leaving & stall not cleaned.  Also, I've heard that SM offers 50% discount to the community which is nice but the average dinner would be about 75$ - $100 & don't think the residents of Braddock could really afford that. Also, I had read that Kevin S was going to start a culinary program for under-privileged which would be a great gift to the community I hope that does happens!"}
{"text":"Sooo good. Ordered the venison it was melt in your mouth tender.  Service was great.  Wait staff was attentive, informative and friendly.  Never felt rushed.  It's great place to linger over an excellent meal."}
{"text":"Last night we finally found a reason to get to Superior Motors. It was outstanding in all respects, although the drive from the north hills was extremely painful. The building, located in a severely depressed area, is beautifully remodeled, with all details, down to the napkin holders, thoughtfully designed to fit the neighborhood's steel mill heritage. Our party of four adults and two young girls ordered most of the items on the menu from appetizers to desserts. Everything was excellent. Service was satisfactory, although the pace could have been quicker at the end, with the young girls obviously running out of patience. The wine list is well conceived and fairly priced (in the context of an upscale restaurant, that is). While the menu prices seem relatively low, there are no full dinners available, with the main courses being something between a small plate and ala-cart entre. You need to order two or three items to make a meal. It turns out to be quite expensive, so it's not an everyday destination. While I always prefer the weekday experience at the best restaurants, next time I'm going on a Saturday night to avoid the rush hour traffic!"}
{"text":"Greatest meal I have ever had.  This place definitely lives up to the hype from Parts Unkown.  The atmosphere is trendy without being pretentious.  If you're willing to spend some money and go to a part of town not normally on your compass then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Great food and knowledgeable staff. Not really many places in Pittsburgh on this level. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm giving Superior Motors some leeway since they just opened, but feel the need to mention some missteps that could dampen others' experiences too. The biggest one was that we were advised to order 3 entrees to split between the 2 of us, in addition to an appetizer.  This was way too much food and we agreed that it seemed like an upcharge tactic.  To repeat: you do not need to order more than one entree for yourself, the portions are totally normal!    There was also a point-of-sale error that affected us and the couple next to us, too: we noticed an extra entree charge on our bill, pointed it out, and then waited 15-20 minutes before getting a corrected bill and our card back.  I know that these things happen, especially when you're just opening, but the staff didn't seem very apologetic and coupled with the misleading advice above (plus a mid-meal stretch where we tried in vain to get our server's attention) it just didn't seem like they cared very much.  I really enjoyed Salt of the Earth and was looking forward to trying Kevin Sousa's new venture but our experience was disappointing.  While good, I can't say that our meal (beef tartare appetizer and beef, pork, and halbut entrees) was terribly unique or memorable... sorry, I won't be rushing back for a second try."}
{"text":"Our whole group had an awesome experience here. The drinks were great. I'd recommend the absinthe one. Loved the bread and cheese app and the bread desert. Little pricy but not over priced.    Side note: My friend whose birthday we were celebrating, was super excited to talk to the chef bc she was obsessed with Salt (his last restaurant). He was kind enough to come greet our whole table even though it was a Friday night and busy AF. Thought that was really sweet. Made her night. We'll definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"The Service was superior and the food looked and tasted of elegance.  We decided on their tasting menu for something different and received just that, very unique and they really cared for our opinion.  I will definitely be returning and would recommend to all."}
{"text":"I was planning to preface my review for mentioning my bias in being a fan of previous Sousa concepts, the Braddock initiatives (worth looking into) and the fact that it was opening night. But there's no need.   Go here. You won't be disappointed. Service was outstanding (did I mention that it was opening night?).   The food was even better.   The space is beautiful and the perfect environment to enjoy company.   They'll be switching up the menu quite frequently early on from what I've been told, so hustle in to try any of what I mention (and cross your fingers that a few become signatures *cough* octopus *cough*).  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm a long-lost son of Pittsburgh. I grew up in this beat-up Steel Town. I watched jobs evaporate around me at an exponential rate. I saw people around me slip into the use of the needle. Now, I'm a twenty-something year old yuppie who comes back to Pittsburgh six or seven times a year to see my folks. This place is full of nostalgia and is meaningful to me.  As this city climbs out of the ashes, the food scene is rebounding in a really big way. It's truly symbolic watching new cuisines people would have spat at years ago become popular. My old man saw Superior Motors in a Food and Wine magazine article and sent me the link. I thought, \"wow, this place is perfect for me. I'm a snobby millennial who loves this return to greatness story they're promoting.\"   We walked into the joint and I noticed a Tribe Called Quest vinyl out and \"Push it Along\" playing on their phono. I was charmed instantly.   Unfortunately, that and my vermouth were the highlight of the meal. Service was inadequate. It's heartwarming that a large portion of the work force comes from Braddock. But that doesn't compensate for the quality. The waitress gave my dad my drink. Another waitress mixed up our meal orders at the table and didn't bother to even ask. We had to correct her. They were not apologetic either.  The food reminds me of an avant-garde musician you really want to like for their sheer talent and appearances on more conventional artists' records. But you can't enjoy that artist because their aggregated skills put together make for some horrible art.  The individual items are some of my favorites. I had the diver scallops to start the meal. The scallops are served raw, which I generally dig. However, the seasoning was minimal on the scallops and the cuttlefish. I knew going in the texture on the cuttlefish would be a bit chewy but it was one of the worst textural experiences I have had during a meal. Everything is soft in the bowl. They served three pieces of some greens to add some crunch, but they were soggy. The buckwheat noodles in the ink were tasty but again soft. It just was disappointing along several dimensions.   For the main course, I had the duck. This, too, unfortunately was not fantastic. The swiss chard in cashews wasn't overwhelmingly good. It was okay but it wasn't anything I'd seek out again. The duck didn't really seem to fit with the rest of the plate, which included a swiss chard roll with rhubarb inside and pickled strawberries. Pickled strawberries were very unique. But the flavors seemed so random and nothing was cohesive. For the price of the meal, you can get better elsewhere.   Neither my parents nor I are inclined to go back. It looks like Food & Wine got caught up in the personal narrative rather than what was going on in front of them. Braddock is a dead town and even if Pittsburgh comes back bigger than ever, the location will kill this place given the quality of food they're serving. This place needs to step it up or their Kickstarter money is gonna vanish."}
{"text":"Came to Superior Motors on a Saturday night in September while visiting my parents here in the city. We had all loved Salt of the Earth and had been following Kevin Sousa's every move, waiting anxiously for this restaurant to open. My mom had the opportunity to eat dinner here a month earlier and had told us the food lived up to the hype. The atmosphere and service was great, bt this time around, the food was only OK. We started with the beef tartare, octopus and foie gras torchon. The beef  in the tartare was mixed with crispy rice crackers, topped with bonito flakes and served with nori paper. Put together, the asian flavors way overpowered the beef. The octopus was cooked well and had a nice smokey flavor but lacked acid/heat to balance out the creamy, smokiness of the dish. The foie gras was incredibly sweet and would have made a great dessert but felt out of place as an appetizer.  Our thoughts on the main courses were similar to the appetizers. The pork dish, topped with trout roe and dashi potatoes tasted more like fish than pork. The lamb was OK and the rigatoni was lacking in acid, similar to the octopus. We got the sorbet for desert which was also OK. Our waitress forgot our coffees and when they finally arrived was nice enough to removed them from our bill as an apology. All in all, it seemed like Kevin Sousa was trying to do too much. The manager came over at the end of the meal to ask how things were and we were honest. He was polite and listened to what we had to say. The last kicker was when we got the bill. Part of the wine list is right justified on the page and my 69 year old father had read the bolded number as the price of the bottle of wine. Oh no - that's just the number they assign to the wine. The actual price is on the left - not a natural place for your eye to rest. We had the Molly Dooker wine which my Dad thought was a steal at $45. Nope. It was actually 81 and showed up on the bill that way!"}
{"text":"Outstanding all around. Was there Sat nite 9/8. Cocktails were innovative, unique and delicious in different ways. Wife had vodka with tomato water, I had gin & watermelon. Hers somehow tasted of egg custard, while mine was astringent in a very positive way, which sounds weird.   The octopus with huitlacoche may be the single best Mexican dish being served in all Pittsburgh. It's a flavor profile I've missed since spending a year in Mexico City in the 90s. I'd eat that every day. Wife had the tomato soup, which was a bit spicier than she was thinking, but delicious.   I didn't want to miss out on the foie gras, so Chris suggested we have it as a mid course. And we did. What came was the most absurdly fabulous foie gras we've ever had - it was like a dessert course. The sweetness of beets & cherries and cacao quality of the ground chickories surrounding what was basically a block of goose liver ice cream. Crazy. It's a dish I'll remember for a long time.  Wife had the chicken on Chris's suggestion - and neither of us ever eats chicken out, especially not when \"fine\" dining. It was more or less familiar as comfort food, but with a level of sophistication and layered flavors that made it worthy of the menu. I had the tuna, which was both cold (not cool) and warm at the same time. Chef Sousa has always been a master at textures, but using temperature as an element in this dish worked well. Only thing I didn't really like was the firmness of the chickpeas. Some other bean/legume might've been a better choice.  As I'm a coffee professional, Chris agreed to take us back and look at the brewing station, which comprises twin $700 drip brewers. Chris couldn't recall the make, but they look like Ratio Eights (I could be wrong on this). Regardless, the coffee brew standards are as rigorous, if not moreso, than they were at Salt, which was the first area restaurant to take post-meal coffee seriously.  All in all, great evening in a great space with great food and service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Well you lost me. When I make a 7pm reservation please seat me at 7.... not 30 minutes later. Additionally I'm tired of coming here as a party of 2 and getting seated at the front of the restaurant where the tables are low and you are constantly bent over to eat dinner.  If I'm dropping $100+ for dinner for 2, I'd better be seated at a comfortable,  'normal height' table and chair set. The drinks were great; the plates were mediocre at best.  The staff was very kind and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Cool place... Old car dealership in depressed area of Pittsburgh turned into great restaurant."}
{"text":"Outstanding, Yet Understated! I didn't know what to expect when I booked the reservation, but I was so impressed I had to write! The food has an Asian flair, but isn't oppressively so, the atmosphere is casual (the chairs are about as uncomfortable as you could imagine, but the restaurant itself feels ruggedly urban so I guess that's part of the motif), and the service--way better than I expected. Caroline took great care of us. She explained each dish with such enthusiasm that it was difficult to choose our meals! Every recommendation was on-point... I recommend the Skate, the Lamb and the Sourdough Poundcake. Yum!"}
{"text":"Went tonight to try it for the first time. It was just okay. We weren't crazy about it. It was a long drive for me coming from the south hills. I wouldn't make the trip again because it didn't impress me enough. The portions were very small. I had the venison and only half of the plate had food on it and the other half was empty. It seemed like a very strange preparation. The taste was quite good but it is a bare bones restaurant. The bread is $3 per slice. It seems strange to be charged for a slice of bread. We are in the USA, not Italy. Italy charges for bread & water. Just charge each customer $2-3 more per entree and give us bread. It took 15 minutes for us to receive our cocktails. The servers were very courteous and efficient. But I think they need to hire another bartender to help out, especially on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had a really fun date night here.  Generally speaking, I'm not high-end food guy - know that from the start.  The venison was delicious.  The soup was interesting and creative but I wouldn't order it again.  The tuna was okay.  I loved the bourbon cocktail, wine, and the whole scene was a lot of fun.  The wait staff was also great.  Super fun and helpful!  I'd recommend it to anyone for a great night!  But stick with the red meat and the bourbon."}
{"text":"I went there second time and I should say I was quite impressed by the whole set of vegan appetizers that were super tasty. I would definitely go back for that and still think it is a very nice interior and quite unique. So O recommend trying this place"}
{"text":"the food was excellent but since this is a brand new restaurant and it seems to be quite understaffed, the service is extremely slow. we waited nearly an hour for our entrees and over 30 minutes for our drinks. other than that, everything is great!"}
{"text":"Was. Little concerned when I walked in. Seemed a bit yo pretentious for me. But the wine and food was excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So I never write on yelp but I felt I had to after going here last night. It was by far one of the best meals I've had in Pittsburgh. It is a very cool new spot. The atmosphere is very unique with minimalist furniture and artwork. We sat at the lounge seats which I loved. It's great for young couples. It feels very intimate and you get an unique view of the only steel mill left in the city. The drink list is amazing, they have an extensive wine list which you can tell they put a lot of time into choosing the specific wines. Their seasonal cocktails were also unreal! The food was beautifully presented, you almost didn't want to eat it because you didn't want to ruin the artwork. But it tasted unreal too. My two favorite dishes were the beef tartare appetizer and beef main dish. I could eat both of those every day. Lastly, the staff who worked provided amazing service. Someone different was always checking in and having unique conversation with you. I will definitely be going back for special occasions."}
{"text":"We recently went here with high expectations. Sadly, this did not live up to it. We drove a decent ways to try this out and had reservations only to wait (not too long, but seemed pointless to have reservations). Our server seemed friendly but she generally forgot to come back to our table. Multiple times we ordered drinks or asked for more water and she was nowhere to be found for quite some time. We ordered some of the firsts and while they did tell us one dish was raw, they didn't tell us about all of the ones that were raw and were surprised. The main dishes were ok but nothing worth going back for or for the prices. We asked for a dessert menu but again were forgot about. The service could definitely use some work."}
{"text":"Myself and my boyfriend went to Superior Motors in November, 2017 after waiting years for this restaurant to open.  It was worth the wait, in my opinion.  I've heard mixed reviews on the staff, I really don't have much to say on the matter.  They were nice enough, that's about it.  We ordered beers, so I can't speak to the drinks for our visit.  The meal was phenomenal.  We ordered the rice cake appetizer, and the variety of textures and tastes were delightful.  I ordered the pork and he ordered the venison.  Both were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Again, the variety of tastes and textures in the dishes were remarkable.  I ordered the chocolate dessert and he ordered the pavlova, this is where our experiences differed.  I thoroughly enjoyed my dessert, his was just OK and I wouldn't recommend it, very singular in its flavor.  But, overall I would not say that detracted from the experience.  The coffee was also above average.  I would recommend this restaurant to any one looking for an elegant dining experience."}
{"text":"With all they hype we thought we would give it a go for a Thursday evening dinner. It was a bit busy but there were empty tables, we were told they were full and told we could have a seat at the bar and still have diner there so thats what we did. All the staff were well... Superior..  The decor  was interesting and definitely different. Including the strang hand dryer in the restroom that seems to just blow water on you.  I am really not sure what I ate, I know it was suposed to be chicken and a cabage wrap of some type with some kind if shreaded stuff but the piece of chicken I got was about the size of a finger and the whole \"meal\" was the size of my palm. The chicken wasn't even hot in the middle and due to our close proximity to the kitchen I watched a chef wipe a knife used to cut both cooked and raw food on the same cloth. I am really hopping no one gets sick.  This  is clealry not a place for us and after $75 bucks we both left hungry and ended up stopping at the north braddock street fair for a $4  hot sausage. .. it's accros the street from a steel mill for crying out loud ... its like they got half way to right and then went a totally different direction.  Idk what else to say... Good Luck"}
{"text":"This is a very unique place - the setting in particular with the Edgar Thompson works being across the street enhances the vibe.   Best example of a 5 star experience I've had in a long time and for sure the best experience I've had in Pittsburgh.   For me, It all started off right with the with the Rye cocktail (which was not at all like I expected as it was infused with pomegranate). Next was the beef tartare app , the haddock for the main course followed by desserts for the table - bread pudding and chocolate covered ice cream. Other apps at our table included the rice cakes and the celery root soup. Other entrees:  another Haddock, Veal and Short rib. We all sampled the entrees and loved them.   Exceptional service topped it all off.  If you're into a unique approach to food then this is a must do."}
{"text":"We were seated at the bar because of the large crowd.  The bartender/server was friendly and knowledgeable, however the service was on the slow side.  We got a view into the kitchen and the staff was intense and focused.  The food was excellent from the octopus and salad appetizers to the duck and chicken entrees.  Both my wife and I felt that the portions were small especially for the price.  We decided to skip the $10 desserts and go to baskin robins instead for ice cream.  I think it would be a service to its blue collar location if Superior can find a way to make their excellent product a little more accessible to their neighbors."}
{"text":"Superior Motors is obviously an awesome addition to the Mon valley. And, considering the lack of options in the area, those of us who live or work in the region have been awaiting this newcomer for a while. So, in that context I have nothing critical to say of the venture and wish them the best of successes.   However, my review of the food must proceed as unbiased and frank as possible.   First off, the ambiance and decor made for a very inviting scene from the outside in the evenings. And upon entering, the energy and liveliness of the open kitchen contributed to an enticing atmosphere.   The front of the house was friendly and professional, if not a bit \"chilly\" in their reception. This contrasted with the warmth of the decor and open fire behind the bar that serves as the grill station for the kitchen.   We began with drinks at the bar which were expertly prepared, and which the bar staff were happy to describe as well as forthcoming in their recommendations. I always enjoy a bartender who's willing to guide a decision.   Once our table was ready we were brought into the side dining room which, because of the hard brick walls, was quite loud and lacked the warmth of the open dining area. Nonetheless, it had energy and was not completely cut off from the vibe of the rest of the joint.   Our server was professional, but was not patient enough for us to discuss the menu options with her and just suggested that she come back after we had decided. In a restaurant of this caliber I expect a bit more from a server. The chilly reception by the front of the house and our server's engagement seemed to at least be internally consistent, although probably not what they're going for.   We each had an appetizer and an entree along with a dessert we shared. We chose the octopus, and the foie for our appetizers. For our entrees, we chose the lamb and the beef.   While the grilled octopus itself was excellent, the dish as a whole lacked a coherent idea. Individual elements were well executed, but the dish failed to communicate a clear direction to me. It had some unique elements (huitlacoche, for example) but gave the impression that it was simultaneously reaching out for something new, while at the same time holding back. This curious contrast was also evident in the bright bold acidic flavors coming up against the more traditionally rich ingredients in the dishes. This is probably intentional, but perhaps I just didn't get it to fully enjoy it.   The common thread of slightly dissonant culinary \"notes\" was reflected in each of the remaining dishes, except the dessert, surprising because desserts often are the least imaginative components of a restaurant's vision.   The other appetizer, the foie terrine was the least effective of the 5 dishes we tried. While the foie was succulent and buttery, it was entirely overwhelmed by the cherries and chocolate crumble underneath. This would actually have been an excellent dessert. It was sweet enough for it, and the foie could just as well have been a butter cream.   Our entrees fared better than the apps. The beef dish was quite excellent, it was executed perfectly and the mushroom and kale, and goat cheese sides were perfect. This dish was the best of them all and my guess is, it's representative of what the rest of the menu is going for.   The lamb entree was good as well, with the protein excellently prepared. Again, we had curious dissonant acid notes laid up against traditionally rich items. In theory this should work, all dishes, especially rich ones, need acid, but for some reason the individual components just never meshed for me.   Finally, we finished with the dessert. It was a pavlova, meringue over custard, and finally the sour notes that had been attempting to make it to the forefront of the previous dishes without distracting from the main profile were able to shine. The meringue was beautifully plated and had a subtle chewy texture to it that made it quite enjoyable.   Overall, this was a very strong four star effort, and we're looking forward to coming back. Hopefully by then the service will have risen to the level of what's expected at a place like this. And, hopefully the dishes and the menu will have gelled into a coherent vision. After such a long and arduous road in making this place actually come to fruition, I have no doubt that these final kinks will be overcome as well. And for that, we and the Mon valley can be grateful to see what's in store for us!"}

{"text":"This place is not for the chain restaurant enthusiast.  It is a magical treat of palatial intrigue. The menu is creative and exotic.  It's about flavors, not about excess. If you can appreciate an intellectual plate, then come explore."}
{"text":"Four and a half but reluctant to go to five just yet.  First impressions - no sign that I could see from the street led to a somewhat hesitant \"poking the head in the door\" moment. We had reservations  but were originally seated on the bar side at a knee-high table. The gentleman who was seating us could see the uuhhhhh look on my face (I did not relish the thought of having a full meal at a coffee table) and he juggled a few things around to seat us at a regular table on the other side. The space is gorgeous yet casual and manages to feel welcoming and industrial at the same time.  Server really friendly and welcoming without being too chatty - perfect. Asked if our drive was long to get there (it was about a half an hour because it was a Sunday evening, no way would I attempt it from the South Hills during rush hour) and was, in general, really knowledgeable about the menu and clearly enthusiastic about the place, which gives a nice vibe that sets the whole evening up well.  Menu dropped, not a ton of offerings but what was there looked delicious. We chose two cocktails to start, the Vermouth and the Gin - both of them well-balanced and extremely tasty. Wine list interesting and reasonable and the bottle we got was very good.  The food was superb. We started with the scallops and the octopus then had the beef and the pork for mains. The flavors were incredible and complex and so THOUGHTFUL, for lack of a better word. I have seen people complaining about the prices and the portions here on Yelp - two things I think about that: 1) the prices are not cheap but you can see that there is an incredible amount of work going into these plates and the food cost itself has to be high because the quality is fantastic, and 2) this is a cheffy place with cheffy food and that is either your thing or it is not your thing. If you want a fantastic 16 ounce steak, go to Capital Grille. You will not be disappointed. But if you want to eat something that delights and surprises you, go to Superior Motors and enjoy flavors that you might never have considered working so well together. There are times when I want a giant steak and there are times when I want to eat something I know I could never pull off at home - SM is a place where you get to say WOW, that's amazing.  The desserts - 50% - the smoked chocolate was amazing - the pound cake was dry and the brittle had an off-flavor like something had gone a bit rancid. I think the dryness would have been helped by the ice cream scoop on top that appeared to be on another portion I see here pictured on Yelp - I don't know if mine was missing or they just changed the presentation.  Downside - it is LOUD. Way loud. We were about halfway through our meal when our server, without us asking, mentioned that they were aware the sound was an issue and that they'd ordered baffles to put up to dull it but were awaiting someone to put them up. My husband had actually just said that he wasn't certain he wanted to return, given the fact that we were pretty much shouting at each other the entire evening, but knowing they recognize it and are working to mitigate it is a good thing. Another downside is, of course, the location - it's way off the beaten path (particularly if you are not already an east-ender) and with on-street parking only it could get difficult, particularly in poor weather.   Things I hope for SM - first, that they put up those darned baffles! Haha! Second, that they retain what appears to be an amazing staff - our server was first rate and the other server in our section was so enthusiastic you couldn't help but catch her good mood. Third, that they are able to make a go of it in a tough location - Dave Racicot's first crack at Notion in Aspinwall comes to mind - no one wanted to go all the way out there even though the food was amazing - but I think Kevin Sousa has mitigated some of those issues by making the vibe at SM casual and fun - it fits the way people want to dine out today, I think - there were folks wearing shorts, and the place felt bright and airy.   Finally, Kevin Sousa, if you brought back the Salt Burger, I wouldn't cry. Just saying. :)"}
{"text":"I live out of the area but was a Kickstarter contributor and anxiously awaiting a chance to dine here. I was not disappointed - from the greeting when we walked in the door to the fancy tap in the bathroom on my way back out the door, it was a great experience. The food is very fancy and elaborate so not for every day, but everything was so beautifully prepared and presented I definitely will put Superior Motors on my 'must return' list. The ambience is great. The restaurant is beautiful to look at and despite the polished concrete everywhere, the noise level is surprisingly comfortable. The seating was made for lingering and the bar was beautiful. We had the crab and rice cakes to start, followed by the halibut and pork as mains. All was delicious and beautifully composed. The wine suggestion was great, along with the Maggie's Farm coffee liqueur. Finally, we had the chocolate, panna cotta and Pavlova for dessert - all delicious. Overall it was a highly enjoyable experience with Superior food!"}
{"text":"OMG who would believe such an outstanding restaurant in downtown Braddock. This is a foodie heaven. I began with the raw scallops, then the duck and finished my meal with the sourdough pound cake. My wife's chicken was delicious. Everything was amazing!! Our server (Caroline) was very attentive and spot on with her recommendations. The duck texture was excellent. It is not cheap but very much worth every penny. Bon appetite"}
{"text":"Blew my mind. Tuna tartar was perfect. My steak was tender and juicy  and still hot till the last bite.  But the smoked chocolate was the best dessert I've ever tasted. It was a great experience."}
{"text":"My parents first ate here after seeing Superior Motors on Parts Unknown and loved it so much they booked our family after Thanksgiving dinner here for the Saturday after turkey day at 6:30pm. There is street parking but also a small parking area next door which we were able to squeeze into. The decor is very modern industrial-my husband particularly liked how the back of the bar was lit to shine on all of the bottles there.   We were immediately sat upon arrival in a cozy 5 person booth, which was on the dining side opposite from where my parents sat on their original visit. It was not too crowded but I'd recommend reservations since the holiday probably had something to do with the light crowd. Our server came over quickly, gave some menu highlights, and then left us to explore the ever-changing menu.   We ordered a bottle of Cab franc for the table which paired nicely with our (mostly red) meat entrees. I noticed they allow BYOB too but I'm not sure on the corkage fee but just an FYI for those interested. They serve homemade sourdough bread-at a cost-pre meal if requested. We dove straight into appetizers and entrees though. My parents ordered the beef tartare served with seaweed wraps. While enjoyable they said the beef tartare at Union Standard is superior (having never been I cannot share my opinion) but this version was quite spicy. I tried a forkful and thought it was ok, spicy for sure, I'm not a beef tartare fan at all, but my husband finished the dish for them since they were not too impressed. He enjoyed the spicy flavors and found the seaweed wraps to be the perfect way to wrap the tartare up for delivery to the mouth.   For entrees, 3 of us ordered the short rib dish. My mom was highly disappointed they changed the menu and didn't have the steak (best since Argentina she said-which was in February). All of us loved the short rib! The meat was super tender, the béarnaise sauce intermixed with mushroom and onions was the perfect accompaniment for the flavorful short ribs. The polenta was interesting. I'm not familiar with it but this version was in cubes with a cinnamon-like outer coating. The only miss here was the Brussels sprouts which were not cooked thoroughly and were quite hard. My dad ordered the halibut which was served with a miso broth poured on top upon its arrival to the table. Of course, no one got a taste but he said it was unique and delicious. My husband ordered the pork dish, complete with trout roe, and loved it-his plate was the first one cleaned. For dessert my husband and I shared the chocolate dessert as did my mom and dad. It was really, um, interesting. I'm a purist with chocolate so I wish the lower layer of the black sesame patty had not been there because the adzuki ice cream with chocolate ganache and the cherries was delicious! My brother ordered the panna cotta, which I wasn't able to try, but since he finished it all, that probably meant he gave his approval of the dessert.   Portions are just right-don't expect to leave overstuffed or hungry. I really enjoyed my dining experience at Superior Motors and, while it's in an area that is probably inconvenient for most of Pittsburgh, I'd still recommend taking the drive to Braddock for a superior dining experience!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  Ambience is great.  The lobster bisque was amazing, and so was the mushroom entree.  My only complaint would be that my mushroom dish was a significantly smaller portion than my friend's portion.  Becomes awkward when I'm trying to eat as slowly as possible so I don't finish my dinner too quickly."}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant last night and have to say that I was very impressed.  Chef Kevin mixes ingredients that initially seem unmatched (e.g. Foie gras and cherries), that end up complementing each other spectacularly.  Our party of three thoroughly enjoyed every course.  We found ourselves noting the contrasting flavors and textures and eagerly sharing tastes of everything that we ordered.  Everything up to and including the coffee was top flight.  The staff was cheerful, knowledgeable and attentive.  We will absolutely be returning here.  Kudos to Chef Kevin and his wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"I was absolutely blown away by my meal. Started off with the punch cocktail which had notes of cinnamon and lime- a good sipper. First course was the salmon tartare and it was phenomenal. It was so fresh and I thoroughly enjoyed it. For the main course I had the short ribs. Next time I'm there I can't wait to order it again. The beef literally melted in my mouth, paired perfectly with fresh Brussels sprouts and polenta, it was almost like eating a meal at my grandmothers. Dessert called for the Pavlove- an orangey meringue with fermented fruit and blood oranges. Spoke for some time with the manager(?) and he was hilarious and down to earth.  Even had a chance to thank the chef for my wonderful meal. I will definitely definitely be returning very soon."}
{"text":"C'mon Team Sousa! I cannot believe that the menu selection had so few options for vegetarians! It is getting tiresome to go to these hot new numbers to find that it's all duck, pork, shank, etc. etc. I expect more from restaurants than a smattering of token veg dishes. This is especially so when my friends and I go out of our way (big time) to go to Braddock. I would have had my drink and split, but well, I was kinda of stuck...in Braddock! Staff are wonderful and the drinks were grand. The latter helped to numb my disappointment. So, if you are reading this, please do more for those of us who do not eat meat, or at the very least perhaps post the menu so we/I can make a decision to go way out of my way to visit your business or not."}
{"text":"I've heard many good things about this place, so I decided to give it a try on a Saturday night. I made reservations about 3 days in advance for 2 people, and I was only able to get bar seating. I really enjoyed sitting at the bar because I was able to see the cooks in action. Our waiter recommended that we order about 5 plates between the two of us. That ended up being the perfect amount of food without overfilling us. Our waiter was also very good at recommending food for us to order. I highly suggest getting the pig face, it's not something I would normally order but I ventured outside my comfort zone and was happily surprised. For our main protein we ordered the chicken and lamb. Since I do not eat a lot of meat I ordered the chicken thinking it be a safe dish I knew I would like.  I ended I'm loving my bf lamb, it was cooked to perfection. I wasn't crazy about the chicken though, it almost seemed undercooked. It was super moist which is good for chicken, but it definitely had very pink parts to it. Our waiter was so nice I didn't want to say anything, I also didn't know if that is just how they cooked it there and if I was being picky. All in all it's a great restaurant, but it is very pricey for a Pittsburgh restaurant."}
{"text":"We were extremely disappointed with the meal at this restaurant. Portions were unnecessarily small. The bottles of wine were overpriced Compared to other good restaurants in town. Incidentally on one of the appetizers there was a hair that we pointed out to the waiter who basically ignored us. We decided to walk away without even trying to get dessert and will never return to this restaurant. The physical plant of the restaurant appeared interesting, but would recommend staying away."}
{"text":"4.5 rounded up for phenomenal service (Sarah is a gem and SM would do well to keep her on!). We were seated in the dreaded low table area, but we found the bench-style seating nicely intimate. I agree with another reviewer that if you're dining in a non-date duo, you should alert the host that you don't want this style seating.   We went with two starters, two entrees, and one dessert, and it was a bit more food than we needed. For starters, we got the tuna tartare and the foie gras. The foie was a really interesting combination of flavors--the cherry, beet, nuts, and foie all sang together. However, we both thought that it was easy to get fatigued from the flavors. It would make an absolutely incredible \"spoon\" (like a two-bite dish), but a bowl of it was a bit much. The tartare was well-seasoned, featuring the flavors of the whole dish rather than just highlighting fresh fish. The dish is also available with beef instead of tuna.  For the entrees, we went for the lamb and the pork. The lamb was the most tender I've ever eaten, and the lentils and veg underneath were delicious. The pork was a duet--tenderloin and pork belly. The pork belly was tender and crisp, and topped with a really cool take on \"pork floss.\" Our server explained that it was made from a Japanese technique of repeatedly dehydrating and grinding the pork...whatever it was, it was insanely flavorful. We were less enamored with the overall composition of the dish--the veg were a bit bitter and seemed to clash with the rest of the flavors.  For dessert, we went with the pavlova. We make pavlova a lot at home, and this was just as it should be--crisp on the outside, marshmallow on the inside. The yuzu curd was perfectly proportioned, and it was a lovely end to the meal.  Sarah told us that the menu will be changing in another few weeks, so we will likely trek out to Braddock again to sample Kevin Sousa's latest creations...the man is not boring! Unfortunately, the amazing, convivial space lacks happy hour specials, but those may be in the works down the line.  NB: Parking is to the right of the restaurant as you're facing it; the lot to the left belongs to an adjacent building."}
{"text":"What a great location and big cheer for investing in Braddock!   Overall it was a good first experience.   Cocktails were unique and delicious.   First course included a tasty beet salad and a not so impressive Asian rice cake with peanut dressing option.    Second courses were delicious.  Pork and Salmon.    Desserts were also tasty.  The wait staff was great from top to bottom and I really enjoyed the space......with one exception.  The bathroom was rather \"exposing\" and the combination faucet/hand dryer splashed water from the sink onto my pants."}
{"text":"Delicious food that you cannot find anywhere else! Price point is a lot higher than I was expecting but the dessert was worth it"}
{"text":"Ambitious and inventive, industrial and clean ambiance. The diverse wine list made an extraordinary accompaniment to our starter choices. I can not recommend enough the octopus and fois torchon. The octopus paired with huilchuile and jalapeño really rounded out the palate to a Mexicano inspired umami.  The fois was perfection, there is something delightfully creamy about their preparation and pairing with cherries perfectly balanced this dish. For our entrees we enjoyed the pork with sassafras and roe, the pork would have developed greater flavor with more seasoning. The sweetbread pasta with shrimp read as an thoughtful combination but as the sweetbreads were fried they felt a deconstructed mismatch in a typical spring rigatoni, tasted fine but lacked wow. In close, after our entrees were cleared, we were eager to try dessert but after waiting 15 minutes and waving down  our bar server to return we opted to take the check instead. We will return in hopes of more amazing appetizers. Sousa is on to something..."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review one month after I first visited Superior Motors. I was a fan of Kevin Souza's Salt of the Earth and I was pretty disappointed when they shut down. It took a while for SM to open, then it was featured on Anthony's Bourdain and that discouraged me to go because I figured it would be packed with curious followers of the CNN show. But I was dragged there by friends on a night out. Glad I was. Atmosphere is great, they did an amazing job with the decoration. Instead of hiding the views to an old USS steel mill across the street they actually integrated into the restaurant using large glass windows. The result is pretty amazing, a surreal view of an old, grim, dark part of the neighborhood from the modern, cozy and warm dinning area of the restaurant. Food and service are great as expected from Kevin and his team, I had venison for the first time ever and it was delicious. We were a large group and the consensus was it is pretty damn good. Recommended."}
{"text":"I fur one like surprises - not like dogs or company coming over - not like that. I like when I eat salmon and tuna flavored treats and they have soft centers: surprise! Well that's just the reason I loved Superior Motors. I had the rice cakes, soup, and veg entree and let meow tell you...I didn't know WHAT was going on in my mouth. And that's ex-cat-ly what I miss about experimental/modern american cuisine. MEOW!"}
{"text":"Why would anyone go to Braddock for dinner?  There is one very good reason....SUPERIOR MOTORS.  This is one of the best casual, yet elegant dinner restaurants in the Pittsburgh area.  Staff is knowledgable, helpful and friendly.  The visit begins in the parking lot when we experienced smell of the wood-fire coming from the kitchen.  It has comfortable, pleasant seating with a full bar that is well stocked with a generous, well organized \"vintage and domestic\" wine list.  I can only say our meals (4) were each \"extraordinary\".  The short menu, downloadable in advance (and recommended), helps you to choose dinner.  The menu includes a nice variety of mouthwatering treats for your palate from both sea and land.   I highly recommend a trip/adventure in Braddock to enjoy a Superior dinner."}
{"text":"Wow. I wish I could dine here every day, but it's a bit spendy to become a regular place for me.  I started with drinks  the Gin, Mezcal and Tequila cocktails, I had a taste of the Rum and my god they were all so perfect. I think my favorite was the Mezcal. The server that we had was so pleasant and helped a lot with recommendations. Ordering felt like a consultative shopping experience, and whenever they brought the food out, everything was more thoroughly described to us. Guys, before this day, I have never eaten a salad that made me moan out load. The dressing was creamy and complex in flavor, I really couldn't even tell you what it was. The mushrooms melted in my mouth like no mushrooms ever have before... and there were soaked almonds in it which added yet another suprise to my dining experience. I made everyone at the table taste my salad and they looked at me like I was crazy, but after they tasted it, they understood my excitement. Moving on to the seitan... WOAH. I have never dated seitan that had such a smooth and consistent texture. The portion looked small, but seitan is quite filling so those two items were plenty for me to eat without feeling stuffed. I didnt have room for dessert, but I tasted the ice cream dish that they had. Dark chocolate garnishes on and under a lime ice cream. It was SO good and reminded me of imported chocolates that I once had. I think this is a great place for groups, or for a romantic evening with a loved one... leave your kids at home, no one wants to hear them while they're enjoying the tranquility and complexity that this restaurant has to offer."}
{"text":"Finally got out to Superior Motors - man did it live up to the hype and then some!! Was blown away by how friendly and accommodating the staff was. Before arriving I called to inquire about what entrees could be adjusted for a vegan. The woman on the phone was so happy to walk me through the menu and discuss which items could be adjusted and made vegan (several of them!--basically just omitting the cheese). All the pictures looked so good, so I knew I was in for a treat.   The restaurant itself is so clean, simple and elegant. From big half circle booths, tons of tables, to the bar, and even a back dining area, the restaurant was definitely very large. So nice that my party of four was seated at a large booth and not crammed at a four person table. Our table was ready the second we walked through the doors and our waiter arrived within moments of us sitting down. Definitely would recommend a reservation as it was quite crowded at 5 PM on a Sunday.   Our waiter walked us through the menu and was happy to describe all dishes in further detail. My table ended up ordering the beef entrée, sturgeon, and mushroom risotto. Holy heck was the mushroom risotto perfection. The rye and pearl barley was a perfect al dente and really made the meal feel super hearty and filling. It was topped with just two tiny tiny slices of mushroom. My only complaint is compared to both the beef & fish entrée which were quite large, the portion size of the risotto was teeny tiny--almost appetizer size. Felt that as being an entrée it definitely should have been a bigger portion. Although aside from the size, the taste was absolutely exquisite. It was made vegan by omitting the goat cheese and WOW was it amazing. For dessert they had four options and our waiter advised us the further down the list you go, the less traditional the desserts became. Fortunately the coconut dessert was vegan and also last on the list, it was super unique and so very delicious. We also ordered the pear tart and my party absolutely loved it. So sweet they even put a candle on the dessert for my boyfriend's birthday. Loved everything about our meal here, and I can't wait to get back again in the near future."}
{"text":"Sit at the bar and watch the action. Great food, great cocktails. The place is ever changing and top notch. If you haven't been then what are you waiting for"}
{"text":"I am a big Kevin Sousa fan. I very much miss Union Pig & Chicken and miss Salt of the Earth. Union Pig was much more my style of eatery...    This place is probably one of the 5 best restaurants in PIT. That it sits in the shadow of the Edgar Thompson Works, in Braddock, is amazing actually if you know the area. This real estate, just a decade ago, was entirely derelict and quite dangerous. Braddocc Mayor John Fetterman, through the will and force of his personality, has made this entire ZIP code habitable again. I believe he owns the building Superior Motors is in ...   Sousa and his staff create and serve food that is flavorful, challenging, and ... if you enjoy the gourmet experience ... thrilling. I have to admit, that's not my thing at all. This is just not my kind of place. I had a steak dish when it first opened (wish I'd taken better notes, believe it was Argentenian steak of some variety - was excellent) and it was not on the menu when I returned in 12/2017.   Appetizers are all works of art. The only one that I was interested in eating was the beef tartare ... and it was excellent, 5 star.   I have had the pork dish (I don't like caviar with my pig, sorry), and it was good. Very good. I think the presentation and arrangement was superior to the dish itself. Have also had the short rib which was equally stunning. Like wow, this is astounding to behold.    You can BYOB, with a cork fee, which I always appreciate.   I have never had service matching the price of dining here. Never. I don't show up in camp pants and a Penguins jersey either(I know what you were thinking!) I know \"how to eat\" and \"how to order\" at a 5 star restaurant ... the staff here treated me like a rube. Several times, when asking questions about the menu, the server deferred and said \"I'll just let you have more time to review the menu.\" NO, I don't need more time... I need you to answer my question. Good lord. Never encountered that sort of treatment at any of Sousa's other eateries.   Anyway, if you enjoy food as art? You will LOVE this place. If not, you won't. This is a very unique gourmet restaurant that offers truly unique and superior dishes."}
{"text":"Really good food to go along with a nice ambiance and friendly waitstaff. The prices are a bit high and not the best bang for buck. However, makes a good place for special occasions or fancy nights out."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the industrial atmosphere enticed me before I even walked in. I enjoyed the pleasant and proactive staff that were entertaining and attentive. The food was delicious. The wine menu has something for everyone. There wasn't much to offer when it came to soft drinks but the basics is all you need. I was impressed with the cocktails and the passion put into the place. The chicken was seasoned well. The cabbage was cooked just right. It wasn't too loud or too quiet. The smoked chocolate dessert was most definitely the star of the show here. I can't wait to come back. Maybe next time I'll go for the salmon. I'm not courageous enough for the octopus."}
{"text":"We started with the beef tartare and the octopus, and had halibut and beef for our mains. All dishes were DELICIOUS, as well as inventive, balanced, and easy on the eyes. The octopus is particularly tender and flavorful. The menu is deliberately minimalist - it's to encourage you to talk to your server! It's a unique space in a unique town, and I'm so happy it's open. Also, the house cocktail menu is super awesome and tasty, especially the vermouth."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my meal at Superior Motors this evening. I started with the \"Punch\" cocktail, which was not too sweet and had a nice spice flavor to it.   Our Server, Bon, is an amazing beautiful genius who made fantastic recommendations to ensure that I had a fantastic dining experience. I have celiacs, and my husband is vegetarian, so we have to be careful about what we eat. Bon carefully and thoughtfully explained how certain dishes could be made to accommodate our dietary needs. She also made sure that the chef knew about our special requests.   Bon also suggested a phenomenal wine parring of rose and a red, both from the same grape. I generally enjoy a very dry wine, and her suggestions did not disappoint!!   I would highly recommend Superior Motors yo anyone looking for spectacular food and excellent service! SM lives up to the hype!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I've been looking forward to the opening of superior motors ever since I first heard about the concept for years ago. We live across the river in a borough with challenges similar to those of Braddock and the concept of the restaurant is really beautiful. Every struggling neighborhood could use a restaurant that seeks to employ and provide skills toLocal residents. So three stars for that vision and for the fact that it seems they're actually carrying it out.  However, my wife and I went out for a big date here last night and ended up leaving halfway through our meal because we didn't want to continue to spend big money on mediocre food. We arrived early and sat at the bar for cocktails and some quiet reading time. The decor might've been cool in 2002, but to see exposed brick and a general warehouse feel in 2018 seems passé. There was nothing comfortable or beautiful about the space. The barstools are set a long way away from the bar so you have to really lean forward. A surprising proportion of the seating - - probably half of it - - is booths and couches around low coffee tables. I always prefer a chair that I can position as close to or as far from the table as I like. And Heaven forbid I would have to sit at one of those little couches and bend over my low table while I try to eat a nice meal!   We then moved to a table for dinner. At the table behind us a server was giving a voluble lecture on the menu. It went on for at least four minutes. We ordered a couple small plates to start, at which point our waiter recommended that we order our entire meal so that we would not \"have to wait between courses.\" When we go out for a nice evening, we don't think of the time spent at the table as waiting. If we want to order a couple of small plates and then order an entrée later please just let us do that. We got the definite sense that the waiter was trying to move us out of our table.   The waiter was knowledgeable about the wine list and helped us pick an excellent Italian rosé. That bottle was the highlight of the evening, really something special.  One of our small plates was \"OCEAN TROUT /  everything panzanella, buttermilk, ramps.\" We are big fans of ramps. We are also big fans of gravlax style cured fish, which is a good thing because that's how the trout was prepared. The Panzanella turned out to be a quarter handful of tiny crouton cubes. But no ramps! I asked the waiter about this. He went back to the kitchen to check. Ha ha, he returned, it turns out there are tiny specs of ramps among the bread cubes. OK, fine. But why advertise this as a feature of this particular dish? They might as well have mentioned salt and pepper for all the ramps did for this dish.  Now it was beginning to dawn on us why the server behind us had been giving a lecture on the menu. This is a menu that requires not just detailed commentary but actual error correction. The descriptions are opaque to the point of being misleading.  Another item, \"DIVER SCALLOP /  (*) buckwheat noodles, cuttlefish, sesame,\" consisted of a very cold raw scallop diced among soupy noodles awash in squid ink and sesame oil. There was nothing transformative about this - and despite being longtime fans of various raw preparations of shellfish and other kinds of fish, we found this dish unpleasant to the point of leaving it on the table. We also felt a bit deceived; we were both looking forward to squid and while we have had wonderful dishes that involve squid ink, a bit of the actual cuttlefish meat would have been nice. And in this case the squid ink was used without subtlety and without any apparent complementarity with the scallop.  The food highlight was the boudin noir that came alongside a deep fried puck of pulled pork (\"pig's face\"). This was an exquisite take on blood pudding and reminded me of the wonderful meals I had back at Kevin Sousa's first restaurant, Salt of the Earth. Superior motors might stand out as a top 10 restaurant in the nation because of its story and its genuinely good mission. But I would not even put it in the top 10 of restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Where did we go after we left mid meal? To our neighborhood standby, honest johns in Homestead. The menu there generally has nothing you couldn't make yourself with some effort at home, but it is all very very well executed and as we looked around we realized that honest johns employed just as many minority, neighborhood residents as superior motors--and not just busing tables but also serving and bartending. They also have an excellent woman chef which is a rarity not only in Pittsburgh but nationwide. Here's a restaurant that is very quietly doing great things for its neighborhood--things that superior motors has received national accolades for. Come to Homestead and check it out!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out. Superior Motors is in a very edgy neighborhood and the contrast (a pretentious restaurant in a neighborhood peppered with shootings/stabbings just blocks away) felt very off-putting and voyeuristic to me.    I will say that I love the decor and was really impressed by all the artwork. I wish the creativity was translated into the food. We had the duck, pork, and beef. I thought the composition of the pork dish was very focused, but did not understand why they plated the entire dish in one corner of a plate. It helps sometimes to spread the ingredients out and allow them to breathe a little. I also wasn't too excited about the marmalade that accompanied the duck.   To finish, I had the tart, which was an interpretation of key lime pie. I thought the dessert had really good balance. I love it when a dessert is rich and satisfying but doesn't taste sweet.   Overall I'd say I have mixed feelings about this place. It is a very unique experience, but could be so much more."}
{"text":"Amanda L. I couldn't agree with you more on the astronomical prices. The food was prepared and presented well but definitely overpriced. The cocktails were ok but seriously 19 choices for food and two full pages of alcoholic beverages? Foie Gras resembles a dessert, covered with so many cherries to cover the small portion and saltiness of the tourchon. Beef Tartar, sorry misses the mark entirely, call it something else, just not Tartar. The service was ok, but just that \"ok\". Cocktails must be on a coaster, our table became a mess, bare minimum table maintenance. The sounds echo like it is still a garage! Do something to soften the sounds. I'm not knocking the effort to revitalize the area, this is going to take tremendous support from the community and surrounding communities, in my opinion. You want me back, right? Expand the menu options, drop the superiority complex. You need to give before you get. this area has been depressed for many years and right now I just don't see the value for the dollar, therefore I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I will admit, knowing the story behind Superior Motors, I was already a fan before I stepped foot inside the building.  But since this is a review of my actual experience, I'll let the yelpers do a little history review on their own time:)  The ambiance is awesome: industrial + edgy with a staff that is warm and friendly.  Despite our reservation, we ended up having to wait for about 20 minutes before being seated, which honestly was not a problem, as my friend and I just checked out the decor etc.  The hostess was lovely and offered to order cocktails for us at the bar and bring them back to us in the entryway while we waited, because the bar area has a \"no standing\" policy.  We decided to wait on our drinks, because standing in the doorway just felt a little bit awkward...but since the bar was full we were out of luck to grab a seat this time around.  The space is divided into a main dining room with bar, and then off to the left is a second dining room that offers a slightly quieter atmosphere, but the same outstanding service even though we are slightly tucked away.    Anthony was our waiter, and from the moment he approached our table we knew he was good!  He guided us through the wine and cocktail menus, as well as the food menu and gave us a little history on his work in the restaurant industry and his love of chef Kevin's newest endeavor.  I felt like I'd known him for years!  He was great!  Uber positive energy, not too pushy, and very knowledgeable on all of the menu items (which are unique as only Kevin Sousa can do!)  I went into this meal expecting \"different\" menu options, but also preparing to leave wanting a snack, as that was my typical experience at his former restaurant.  I could not have been more wrong!  My friend and I each ordered an appetizer, an entree, and dessert, and by the time I left, I was borderline uncomfortably full.  That halibut was HUGE!  Flaky, cooked to perfection, with flavors that tasted clean and fresh.  The rice cake appetizer was really creative and flavorful as well (see photo) but could have easily served as my entree, or at least is a good app to share.  (Don't be fooled though...I ate every last bite).  I finished off with the smoked chocolate dessert, which reminded me of a flan in texture, a really really nice smoky chocolate mousse flavor, but I have to say, the morel mushroom on top didn't do it for me.  I wanted to love it...different idea, eclectic combo as only Chef Sousa would do, but I couldn't like it.  So I sadly tucked it aside and devoured the rest of the dessert.  Now my friend had ordered the pound cake and let me just say there was nothing not to love about that!!  I could have licked the bowl.  I look forward to returning and trying more of his dishes, because I am certain one dish is as good or better than the next!  I will try to get there earlier next time in hopes of scoring a bar seat and trying out some of those bar snacks...it's a solid 4 star experience, and I hope everyone checks out this great Braddock establishment."}
{"text":"My third stop for restaurant week was Superior Motors.  Yum.  All things Yum.    Superior motors had 2 menus for restaurant week.  One was vegetarian and one was meat.  We got both offerings and shared both.  The first course - Ocean Trout tartare and Carrot Tartare was amazing.  My friend wasn't the biggest fan (and it's not for everyone!)  but i certainly enjoyed sampling both.  I actually think the carrot tartare was my favorite!  Course 2 - the second course - was Korean Rice cakes or the Beef Shortrib.  I enjoyed the korean rice cakes - but the polenta with the short rib was my favorite of the night.  I'd happily take a side dish of just that.  It was so stinking good!    The third course - was the \"pasta\" course.  Sage cavatelli and pearl barley and rye risotto.  Both dishes again - were phenomenal.  Nothing disappointed.    This was my second visit to Superior Motors.  It didn't disappoint.  I truly enjoy this restaurant.  I did request (per my review from last visit!) to not sit in the low couch like seats and was happy to be seated at a normal table :)  Go - Enjoy - eat great food."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Superior Motors for an epic date night that we will long remember. I prefaced the visit by calling and speaking with Chris Clark, the GM, who asked a few questions about our preferences and then spoke to Chef Sousa. My request was that we didn't want to make any decisions - that we wanted to be surprised and eat until we busted open.  We went a bit early, which I highly recommend, so we could walk around a bit. SM is located directly across the street from the USS Mon Valley Works Edgar Thomson Plant. I loved that the restaurant really fits into its surroundings and does not overwhelm the neighborhood. Arriving early will also give you a chance to check out the interior and grab a drink.  Chris met us when we arrived; and, knowing how busy the reservation book was, recommended that we just sit at the bar. This couldn't have been a more spot on recommendation for us, as we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The bartenders were not just friendly but awesome wait staff themselves. They paired all of our dishes with the perfect choices of IPA, prosecco, saki, and a Greek red wine.  The food...oh, the food...  We started with what turned out to be the only challenging dishes for the both of us. My husband had the diver scallop with buckwheat noodles and cuddlefish ink. I had the cobia, with freeze dried avocado noodles (YUM! I could eat a whole bowl!), and a tomatillo/jalapeno/cilantro broth. What was challenging for the both of us was just that we hadn't ever had such unique raw seafood preparations before - so it was just an overwhelming starter - but delicious nevertheless.  For the next course, I had black cod with sunchokes, kale, and leek. I'll mention here that Chef Sousa's dishes are always loaded with fresh veg - and the veg are always prepared with multiple cooking techniques to keep the flavors and textures constantly evolving based on what's on your fork next. My husband had the salmon, with white asparagus, sorrel, hazelnut, and a hollandaise. Again, the textures and flavors here were morphed with every bite.  For the next course, I had a chicken dish that was so reminiscent of my Nana's funsei (a South American dish) that I got all choked up with nostalgia - but I still managed to gobble down what was an outstanding chicken dish. My husband had the veal with ricotta, asparagus, and fiddleheads. What an incredible combination of meat, cheese, and veg! I could have eaten a whole platter of this.  Overall, Chris and Chef Sousa picked the ideal combination of dishes for us: challenging, comforting, and downright delicious all around. At this point, we were pretty full from cruising through the menu; however, the pasta was calling to me...  We ordered one last savory course to share - the house made pappardelle with egg, watercress, and cauliflower. As a carnivore myself, I couldn't have loved this veg dish more. It was like the great red wine we were sipping: delicate and still packing a bold flavor punch.  Any regular diner would have thrown in the napkin - but not us! We finished our journey with the ganache, yuzu, lime dessert. Chocolate with citrus is probably one of my favorite combos so I was a happy camper.   I will warn the frugal spender: Superior Motors is quite pricey; however, you 100% get what you pay for, which, in this case, is superior service, libations, and food. And if that's not enough, remember what Chef Sousa is doing for the neighborhood and Braddock Youth Project kids; about how he both reclaimed and re-visioned the history of the building itself; and, the fact that products are sourced from area vendors.  It is easy to see why 'Food & Wine' considers Superior Motors to be the Restaurant of the Year. I look forward to seeing Chef Sousa continue to grow. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went for opening night and it was an amazing experience. The staff is great from the moment you walk in til the moment you walk out the door! The food plating and atmosphere make you feel like you're on top chef haha. The beef cut like butter and was delicious. I also really enjoyed the halibut and desserts. Chris (maybe their som?)picked out a great bottle of wine for us as well. Great place for a special occasion or date night."}
{"text":"It's just not good. First, the minute we walked into the place, the overwhelming smell of fish took my breath away. It smelled like we walked into Wholey's and I had to mouth-breath the entire time. The food is all bland. Salad was overdressed and not a single thing stood out where I would want to get it again. There was an octopus appetizer that had potential, but it was smothered in a grey sauce with corn....very unappealing. I will not be back. Plus four of us for dinner with splitting apps and dessert and drinks was still $300"}
{"text":"We had been waiting YEARS for superior motors to open, and by the time it had, we had already moved away! Fortunately, we we able to make time to come out here on our last trip to Pittsburgh.    The food was delicious. I loved Salt of the Earth, and was really looking forward to Kevin Sousa's next venture. In our group we had the octopus, hamachi, almost all the entrees and the pavlova and bread pudding desserts, and saw him working in the open concept kitchen while we were enjoying our meal.  A couple things:  I had issues with our main waitress throughout the night. We were in a group of 6 and we ask a lot of questions when it comes to food and satisfying everyone's palette. She came off and very condescending and more like we were intruding on her restaurant, rather than welcoming us to share this experience with her. We did not feel like sentiment with other waiters and waitresses who came by to collect plates. This was very off-putting and there was really nothing we could do about it.   Cocktails were not good. My watermelon gin drink tasted like watered down gin. I had one sip and didn't touch it for the rest of the night. I had hoped that our waitress would notice and offer a new one but  it just sat there full until our check came. Our general experience with her for the entire night was really bizarre.   The interior decor is really nice but the elevated tables around the perimeter of the restaurant have HUUUUGE tables. Really nice and spacious but hard to reach certain plates. Also when our waitress handed us new plates in between I went to grab mine but she wouldn't let go and stared at me during this power play until I let go so SHE could put my plate down. So weird.   I want to say that the food was worth the money but this particular experience, having to deal with our waitress, was not. I hope to give SM another chance, but don't feel particularly inclined to."}
{"text":"What an unexpected treat. I am here for a conference, and one of my colleagues who went to elementary school nearby recommended the place. I followed the recommendations of our waitress, and despite seeming like an odd combination of ingredients, I was glad I listened to her. Also, she split our checks for a very large party without any grumbling, so that was also greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I was an early adopter in the Kickstarter campaign and came in with high expectations. Those expectations were delivered upon this evening. Also in attendance with me was my 4 year old son, so I will give you his review as well. First off, the wait staff and Chris in management were completely gracious and accommodating in having plain pasta prepared for my son immediately which he devoured. The adults enjoyed the salad, Octopus and rice cake appetizers. I'm reading a lot about portions in the reviews and while they were certainly not huge, they weren't unreasonably small. My son said the salad tasted like soap but continued eating anyway. I didn't quite come away with that that mouthfeel and thought it was fine, maybe slightly unremarkable. The octopus and rice cakes really took the prize. Not sure what was going on with either of them but they were gone in about five minutes. We had the hangar steak and chicken entrees. These were nothing short of spectacular and the steak was borderline art. Expertly prepared in every aspect. We all shared the chocolate and pastry dessert and were very pleased with both. We will be returning regularly and I can't say enough about the service and overall atmosphere. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Chef Kevin Sousa's  2018 award winning restaurant sits in the middle of an old neighborhood in Braddock, PA in what was once a Chevy dealership. The eclectic farm to table menu is laid out differently than most restaurants that we've been to.  Parking is free either on the street or in what was once known as the dealership's parking lot. When we arrived we were seated promptly and a very friendly and helpful waiter guided us through the menu and answered any questions we had. He explained to us that in creating the menu they deviated from the traditional style of appetizers, salads, mains, etc to more of a four course selection where you can pick and choose whatever you wanted. The first page is the entire food menu. The pages that follow it consists of your wine or alcoholic beverages. They have a full bar here.  Anything marked with a \"v\" on the menu meant the item was vegetarian but could be made vegan upon request. I began with the carrot tartare that came with seaweed wraps. My husband had the smoked potato with radish. I was literally blown away with how good that carrot tartare was! Even wrapping portions of it in the seaweed made it more delectable. I tasted my husband's smoked potato and wasn't overly impressed with it.   After completing these items I had discussed with the waiter about the main courses. Everything is cooked to perfection however, be aware of the fact that the inside of most of the dishes can be under cooked.  I say this only to point out the fact that they give that warning about consuming raw or undercooked foods at the bottom of the menu.  I originally wanted the salmon but learning that they could not prepare it well done I then settled for the veal with ricotta, asparagus, and fiddleheads. My husband went with the chicken where he was given two thighs along with morels, endive, and hickory. We waited a bit for our food but it had a nice presentation. I found the veal tender but wasn't used to the preparation. On the other hand I was literally blown away by the fiddleheads. They look like round asparagus and are seasonal to this time of year. My husband told me he enjoyed his chicken meal.  Needless to say the two items we ordered literally were filling enough so we had to pass on dessert. The menu is online and does change weekly. It is located across the street from the Edgar Thompson works. It makes a great place to go for a special occasion. Dress is casual."}
{"text":"We loved it! The service and food were both perfect. Looking forward to going back each season to see what changes. There are also additions being finished (theater and event spaces) that looked interesting."}
{"text":"Directly across the street from the Edgar Thompson Works, which was a little surprising.  You can see flames shooting out of the works from out of the restaurant window.  There is parking available right next to the restaurant or street parking if that fills.  Wait staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Menu is exotic and creative.  Well worth the trip to Braddock."}
{"text":"OK- my previous review is below- and I gave the place three- however I went back, and it was HUGELY improved.  Again - the service is still stellar, and with some menu tweaks, I was much happier...  I wish I could do 2.5 stars, but I can't- so I decided to be generous...today.  Just like every reviewer so far, I was super excited to try SM due to the hype and the fact that I usually love every other Sousa Place (RIP Salt) - sadly, it just doesn't live up to it.  I'll note: these are smaller portions and the staff recommends ordering 2-3 dishes/person: we got 2 entrees, 3 apps and a bottle of wine. Our ticket was $225....  First the positives: Our server was very good and incredibly knowledgeable with the wine list.   Front of House service was very good as well.  As far as food, the \"Beef\" was a hanger steak the night we were there and that was delicious.   The Bads:  There is no nice way to say this- the location is dismal, and its a bit of a drive to get to Braddock from most places in Pittsburgh, and frankly the food just isn't worth it.  We had the Chicken wrapped in cabbage (which tasted like...chicken. unflavored); the rice cakes (which tasted vaguely like a chef Boy-R-Dee meal); the Salmon (decent- not amazing) and the Foie Gras (no. just no.).  I know they are changing the menu frequently, so maybe things will get better; but again, its a long drive out there for food to just be \"meh\" and for the price tag attached."}
{"text":"As promised, I have now been to SM three times this week and am upping my rating to 5 stars.    Food:  Outstanding on all counts.  5 stars  I had the Tuna Tartare, the Foie Gras, and the Octopus appetizers.  All extremely tasty and each unique in its own way.  The Tuna actually was the biggest (pleasant) surprise regarding how it was presented.    I had the Veal, the Halibut, and the Pork entrees.  Again, each done perfectly--while they are plated beautifully and are complex, I didn't find them to be 'precious' or over-complicated in terms of presentation.  And all were filling.  Desserts.  All outstanding.   Space and service are still great.  Go now, go often."}
{"text":"I've never ventured out to Braddock before, but I'm glad I did for this place! The vibe in here is so cool. I loved the huge windows in the front that showcase the steel mill across the street. You can tell they put a ton of thought into designing the restaurant.  To drink, I had the \"Punch\". It was very strong - probably a bit too strong for my taste - but still tasty. They were offering a non-vegetarian and vegetarian tasting menu for restaurant week, so we ordered one of each.   We started with a trout and carrot tartar. My favorite of the two was the trout, but the carrot was very unique! You could barely tell that it was carrot because of the smoky flavor. Next was a short rib dish and rice cakes. The short ribs were so tender and rich, and everything else in the dish was really yummy too. The rice cakes were a let down in my opinion, and I probably wouldn't order this one again. Lastly, we had a pasta dish with confit (not sure what type of meat it was) and a mushroom barley risotto dish, both of which were delicious.   We also couldn't help but try two of the desserts (the chocolate and the creme brûlée). The chocolate dessert, which was recommended by our waiter, was the highlight of the night and probably one of the best desserts I've ever had. Skip the creme brûlée and get two chocolate desserts.   Service was great as well - the waiter was very friendly, attentive, and gave us plenty of time to enjoy each dish. I'm looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place and we love the idea of what it is trying to do for the area.  We each had a glass of wine which was fine but I would have liked to have seen a wider selection of reds by the glass.  (As far as I'm concerned most of the whites and all of the roses are the same.).   We started with the homemade sourdough bread which was good but nothing out of the ordinary.  The tuna tartare was good, but the dried fish on top was a but funky and there wasn't enough nori for the amount of fish.  As entrees we had the lamb and brassica.  The lamb was excellent.  Tender and the lentil it was served on was also excellent.  The brassica was good but not exciting.  Overall I would say the food here is very good but we were really hoping to be wowed and we were not.  It's pricey, but not outrageous.  The service was excellent as was the presentation.  You may not be wowed, but it's worthy of giving it a try."}
{"text":"Everyone was so warm and accommodating, from changing our table because of accessibility issues to being patient and gracious in fielding questions. The spring pea starter was just incredible and members in our party loved the chicken and veal. Wish I still lived here-I'd be a regular!"}
{"text":"Foodies...start your engines for Sousa's new spin 'round town. The space has a clean and minimalist design yet catches the eye. For the full extent of the menu, consider trying a dish from each of the four distinct groupings. The peculiar flavor and texture combinations ensure that each dish is something that you've likely never eaten in Pittsburgh. For our meal, the ingredients (a few unknown to our palates) simply worked. And high five to the staff for attentive and enthusiastic service. Not sure I'm sold on the lounge setting we dined in though. Lastly, I'm curious to see if SM can sustain long enough to establish some measure of longevity -- there's just not much in or around Braddock to make a night of it."}
{"text":"I wish there were half stars b/c this place is a 3.5. J and I came here for my birthday last night. We live right around the area and I didn't feel like going far to celebrate. I called a few days a head and made a reservation, which was seamless. The staff on the phone was really nice and made a note of my nut allergy and that it was my birthday. We got there at 7, and were greeted by a lovely Black woman who was polite and really friendly. We were seated quickly which was nice. The atmosphere is really nice. J and I really liked the designs, colors, industrial look, and look of the bar. We actually spent time admiring the table as this is something we would have in our own home. They definitely paid attention to details which was great. Their name on the pens to sign checks, the holder for the napkins and utensils, a lot of little things made the restaurant nice. Our server was Dan with the Cool glasses, who was really great. Very knowledgeable and funny, very warm personality. I was able to try a wine to see if I liked it which was nice. Ultimately I settled on a glass of Riesling and J had a coke. I ordered the beet starter with smoked yogurt, frisée, and yuzu. This was banging. The flavors melded so well together and the yogurt was delicious. For our entrees J ordered the beef with polenta, Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, and bearnaise sauce. J thought his food was good, but \"not $35 good\". I had the tuna (well done), which came with heirloom rice, miso, lemongrass, and XO. My tuna was done perfectly! The meal was tasty overall. For dessert, J had the chocolate cake with coffee and buttermilk (minus the chestnut butter), and I had the creme brûlée with lychee bubble tea, and honey. J's chocolate cake was delicious, and I added some to my creme brûlée. The honey was described to me as a foam on top, but it was more like bubbles. I guess I was expecting something like the consistency shaving cream foam that tasted like honey, not slightly sweet bubbles. Ultimately I scooped it off b/c I felt it added nothing to the actual dish other than making it look interesting. Plus there was too much \"foam\". There were a few things we were not fond of: while we were there, they played this new age trance like music which was loud and pretty annoying; every time someone entered or exited the building there was a chill that settled in the small dining room; and while the wait staff were kind and knowledgeable, J and I felt that our drinks and food took a while to be brought to us. Longer than it should have for such a small space with about 6 wait staff working. Our bill came to around $120 which J was happy with. Overall, it was a nice dinner and the food was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I am biased for sure, because I am a huge Kevin Sousa fan. We've watched the progress of construction over the past couple of years. The beer selection is well-curated. The food is fabulous. I would put the space, the vibe and the food up against any restaurant in any other city - NYC, Chicago, etc. Because it's pricey, I probably won't take the whole family there as often as I'd like, but hope to go back soon with my husband."}
{"text":"The service was excellent but that's the best I can say. The food was fair but it was unrecognizable. The wine selection was limited. No pinot noir. The price was ridiculously expensive for what we ordered."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and atmosphere.  The staff is attentive.  We enjoyed 3 delicious courses including the crispy pig face, venison, and the chocolate dessert. We enjoyed the modern but cozy ambiance while partaking in the chef's creations.  This is one of Pittsburgh's best gems and definitely worth a visit!"}
