{"text":"Griff's is the nicest pool room I have ever seen, by far. Once you go it will be your favorite place to play a game of pool or watch the games. The food is delicious, staff is friendly, and a big plus for me is it is non-smoking. Everything is brand new and immaculately maintained. You have to go see Griff's for yourself!"}
{"text":"Griff's is the ultimate pool hall...plenty of pool tables, and lounge room. You don't feel like you're crammed together. Plenty of t.v.s to watch your favorite game, and excellent food! This place is great!"}
{"text":"My favorite pool hall in the west coast! This was an old pool hall that was taken over and completely demolished. The owner literally started from scratch! And the outcome is nothing less than first class! The Wynn of Pool Halls! Too nice for pool players. Definitely a place to take a date. It has a beautiful bar and the kitchen has a good menu. The design makes it the most comfortable pool hall I've ever been to. There's a custom super comfy seating that surrounds the entire place. Cell phone chargers at every other table. The lighting is done well and makes the place look modern and does not have that typical pool hall look. Black Diamond Tables both 7' and 9'. Lots of HDTVs from anywhere you sit. The bathrooms are super clean like the top casinos in town. Everything is just top class! A must see place that you will definitely go back to."}
{"text":"W.O.W.... Clean, Great Atmosphere, Smoke-Free, Fantastic Service,  Tasty Fresh Burgers, Great Onion Rings, Well Maintained Pool Tables/Cues....  prices were fair.  Bri is such a doll.   Great service with a huge smile!"}
{"text":"I had a very interesting experience tonight at Griffs. A friend of mine told me about Griffs and how it was so much nicer than the previous place Pool Sharks. I have to say it was an amazing atmosphere, beautiful place, new tables . At first it looked like I was going to have a great night. I walked in and was greeted by a nice man by the name of\"Thumbs\" which I though was the coolest old man I have ever met. I proceeded to go to the bar for my first drink of the night and the bartender was awesome. She was funny, and knew what she was doing when I ordered my whisky on the rocks. Told me about a better whiskey than my normal Jim beam. I ended up ordering a bullet rye as suggested by amber (the said bartender). I was thankful as I throughly enjoyed the flavor much more than Jim beam. Things were looking up until it came time to enjoy a few games and a few more whisky's. As my girlfriend and I started our game , we looked for our server so we could order another round. About 15 min of waiting and still no service. I went back to the bar and asked if we had to come and get a drink every time. Amber told us no , that our server would be right with us. I did end up ordering another from her as we waited so long. As we played a few games, my girlfriend got a little hungry . We decided to order food , but yet again we're left waiting as we saw our server watching TV. She was shorter lady in what looked to be wearing a blanket. We finally waived her down and asked about the nachos. She at this time had no idea how to answer if they had liquid cheese or shredded. Her answer was , I don't know what does the menu say? Not the answer we were looking for as paying customers. Other than the horrible service, and the fact that when I asked to speak to a manager , he was apparently not present, everything else was great. I will say Thumbs was amazing and amber and her cocktails were absolutely delicious. My girlfriend had a \" Tropical storm\", well 3 actually lol. I would love to come back and give it another shot, but next time I will not be waiting for service, I will just go to the bar where I felt like I was appreciated.  Update on my second visit:   So I want to be fair and give Griffs another shot. I came back after a subpar experience the last time I was in due to horrible service. As I am in the food and beverage industry and have been for a very long time I know that sometimes you gotta give a place another shot. This time my friends and I decided to make it a guys night. We walked in and I was very happy to see my favorite door man \"Thumbs\"!! Again was greeted by him and felt very welcomed. Saw my awesome bartender again Amber and she knew right off the back to pour my new favorite a double Bullet Rye on the rocks. Got our table and this time the service was AMAZING!! There was a band which played some fun music and made it much more lively. Our server B was aw some. Very funny, sweet, attentive , and knew her stuff. We never had to wait for a drink, we ordered wings and chicken fingers , then B convinced me that I needed fries which I completely fell for and am glad I did! All in all I will definitely be coming back here for my birthday celebration in 3 weeks and will telling my friends at work about Griffs. I have a feeling this will be the new place for us after a long night at work. As long as Thumbs is at the door, Amber is behind the bar and B are there , we will be frequently returning with more people. I hate to say it, but as long as I don't have to put up with our last server again, We will be regulars at Griffs."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was the pleasant and warm vibes I was getting from the company I was with but this place has a coziness to it that I've never felt before in a billiard. The floor plan is very unique and promotes interaction. Everyone was friendly, even the bartender which is rare!  Good drinks, clean bathrooms. I have yet to try the food but the menu looks bomb. And the plus of it all: NON SMOKING!  Yes, winning all around.  I hope to cross paths with this place again. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest but unknown spots in Vegas. Lounge atmosphere, great tables and sticks, friendly bar tenders, and karaoke! I love the blue tables and bright pastels on the balls and I love the white lounge furniture. I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would for the simple fact that this business owner is a racist, this evening following a very depressing day with the Las Vegas shooting I went to the smoke shop right next to them for some cigs and the Griff owner came over and yelled at the smoke shop owner while filming him for his music and went as far to call his music that mind you wasn't even loud \"nigger music\" after a day that we should come together this man went out of his way to be a racist dick. This establishment owners character spoke volumes. Over my dead body would he ever receive a penny from me."}
{"text":"Really cool relaxed vibe . I little pricey for the tables if you're also drinking but it was worth it when we went.  Would be great if they comped tables after a certain amount of drinks/food!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with my parents and girlfriend.  The waitress was good and the establishment was nice, but the bartender did something that was mind-blowing.   We played pool for about an hour before dinner and ordered food and drinks.  As we left, I paid the waitress at the back register for our beers and food and tipped her accordingly.  I then turned immediately to my left to the bartender and asked her how much for the pool time. She said it was $12. I handed her three $5 bills. She said \"thank you\" and didn't return any change.  The rest of the exchange went like this.    Me:  You said $12, right? Bartender (B):  That's right.   Me:  We still need to get our change.  B:  Oh, I thought you were tipping.  Me:  We paid our waitress for the food and drinks and tipped her already B:  Oh, no it's fine, I thought you were tipping for the beers, but it's fine.  You don't have to tip if you don't want to. Me:  We tipped our waitress.  We never ordered any food or drinks from you.  B:  No it's fine.   You don't have to tip.    *I KID YOU NOT!  THIS GIRL TOLD ME TWICE IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE AFTER I ALREADY TIPPED OUR WAITRESS FOR FOOD AND DRINKS THAT WE DIDNT HAVE TO TIP IF WE DIDNT WANT TO!  I NEVER ORDERED A SINGLE DRINK FROM THIS GIRL!  ALL SHE EVER DID FOR ME AT ANY POINT WAS HAND ME A CUE BALL IN EXCHANGE FOR MY ID AND THEN HAND IT BACK WHEN WE LEFT AND THEN INTENTIONALLY TRY AND SHAME ME IN FRONT OF OTHER CUSTOMERS!  I was in shock.  We just left.  I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Had a great time!!!!!! Part of the NCEP group, I send my gratitude to Garry and Marcus Mustafa a world class cook"}
{"text":"Griff's is the finest Billiard Room I have seen, the food, drinks and the service is great ! They have 9' and 7' Diamond pool tables that look and play great , I will also add it is non smoking ! When in Vegas, visiting Griff's is a must !!"}
{"text":"I've visited a large number of pool rooms and this is one of the nicest pool rooms I have been in.  The tables are clean and maintained.  The food is good and I've never had an issue with the service. Not only does Griffs provide weekly tournaments, they also add money to monthly tournaments as well."}
{"text":"Awesome non-smoking pool hall.  Very clean and comfortable with great happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"Don't go here unless you want to have the staff steal from you and then have the management back them up.   I was given the wrong change and when I brought it to the attention of the server, and then manager, they made excuse after excuse about why it wasn't correct. From \"We don't carry change\" to \"We round off\"(in our favor) to \"We ran out of change and was going to bring it to you\"(After 40 minutes had already passed) to \"Nobody has ever complained about us doing this before in the last 3 years\"(we've been robbing people)...that's right. The manager was really proud of the fact that he's been getting away with doing this for years without anyone saying anything.   Yeah, I know. It's petty. It's not a lot of money. It's just change. That may be true, but it's MY change. I should get to choose what I do with it. AND if I choose to ask about it, it should be corrected without all the name calling and rudeness that the manager started with.   They do have nice equipment, but so do a lot of pool halls in Vegas. I suggest going someplace like Good Timez Billiards instead where they have excellent equipment AND honest employees."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place to shoot some pool, I come after 6pm for their $10 an hour price.  This place just has a down side for me.  The bartenders absolutely suck.  The female bartender that was there before midnight made me a delicious Mai Tai and a blue Hawaiian which was a little off but still okay. Now the bartender that is there after midnight has NO IDEA what he's doing, why in the world is he a bartender?? I asked the waitress for 2 Mai tais, she had no idea what I was talking about even asked me what was in it. When I get my drink I immediately see its a different color so I taste it and tell the waitress it's not a Mai Tai, she becomes defensive and proceeds to tell me it's $9 now I paid $6.50 for the last drink so now price goes up after midnight or what?? She tells me she doesn't know anything that id have to argue with the bartender at that point I gave up and just drank my $9 watered down apple juice with rubbing alcohol.  I would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the lack of experienced bartenders, I like a good drink with a good game so this is sad for me. Not to mention their fountain drinks are $6, yikes."}
{"text":"The last time I was in this place, it was called Pool Sharks. The tables were decent for the most part, but like every other pool hall in town, it reeked of smoke (and so did you after a tournament)... the floors were uneven in places... the chairs/stools were on their last leg... and you had to hold your breath to go to the bathroom - oh, and I usually walked to the international market around the corner to get decent food.  All I can say is wow, what a transformation. I'll have to spend more time in there before I rank it as the #1 pool hall that I've ever been to... but it's on the short list for sure. Great remodel job - looks nice, doesn't smell like a stale ashtray, plenty of seating area for rail birds, cozy area for hanging out off to the side, plenty of TVs, thoughtful layout re: the pool players (and even teams for league), nice lighting, nice highlighting, boardroom type colors with hunter green & wood paneling, tasteful art... just really well done. Classy. Congrats. Do we give the credit to Sunny??  I was hungry so I ate - nice looking menu, and the food I had was great. I had the Mosconi Meatball Sandwich. Very tasty. I substituted Onion Rings and those were great as well. I washed all that down with Diet Coke and the staff was very attentive in bringing me refills (as usual, I was thirsty in the dry air of Las Vegas).  I can't say that I'm a fan of the Cyclop balls, but I guess that's a personal issue that I'll have to take up with my therapist. At least they're clean and shiny Cyclop balls.  Thanks for making 3650 S Decatur a nicer place."}
{"text":"Looking for a non smoking place to play pool? Griff's is the newest billiards room in Las Vegas. They are located in the old Pool Sharks location. Griff's completely renovated and features 17 7' Diamond tables, 8 9' Diamond Tables, and 1 12' snooker table. They also have a full bar accompanied by a menu offering different appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, pizza, and more. Griff's will have poker machines soon as well.  Table rates are great. Sunday through Thursday, $10 per hour. Friday and Saturday 18:00-3:00(peak times) $12 per hour For single players, from 3:00-18:00 daily there is a solo rate of $5 per hour.  For league players they also have league play."}
{"text":"Pool tables are in great condition, plenty of cues to pick from, and waitress was very friendly. And it's non-smoking, which is amazing. Food and cocktails were good, nothing great, but certainly better than your average pool hall"}
{"text":"Great pool hall! Live music on Fri and Sat night, and NO SMOKING! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous pool hall! Food was really awesome also. Mozzarella sticks were bomb!  5 stars out of 5."}
{"text":"Great pool hall.  We spent a Sunday at Griff's in a tournament.  Loved the no smoking.  The tables are the best you can get.  The place was very clean.  The food was good.  The staff were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I recently posted a review regarding the cleanliness of the pooltables cloth. I wrote how dirty they were and should be cleaned on a daily basis. Well I must say Griffs has now corrected the problem and the tables are once again great to play on. Griffs management (Gary) immediately responded and took action to correct the problem. CHALK one up for Gary (no pun intended) I also complained about how they did away with the all day rate for $10.00 when a pool event was going on at the Orleans Casino. After thinking about this I came to the conclusion that this was a Business decision which is posted on their web-site regarding special events. Local players will have to decide for themselves if this is fair.  I feel Griffs is a great place to play probably one of the nicest if not on the West Coast."}
{"text":"Nice place to shoot pool, there was a band playing, unfortunately, they left early and we wished they would have stayed longer, but I loved the lighting, just perfect ambiance for drinks and shooting pool!"}
{"text":"There's a new best pool room in Las Vegas, and it's called Griff's. The tables are first rate Diamonds with plenty of 9-foot available as well as a behemoth 12-foot snooker model. They're perfectly maintained, well-lit, outlined for precise racking and ball spotting, and comfortably spaced. Also a generous supply of perfectly tipped cues of various weights and excellent condition are plentiful throughout the room. The seating is ample and couldn't be more comfortable, and the walls adorned with very cool classic posters featuring past greats of the game. This is a place that has to be seen to be appreciated, the photos on their website don't do it full justice. The eats are excellent, (dynamite potato skins) and the drinks are beneficiaries of very healthy pours. Even the bathrooms are so clean they have a photo on their site, nobody does that unless they take great pride in every aspect of the operation. That's definitely the case here, and it's clear the owner(s) spared no expense and attention to detail to offer the area the finest pool hall possible. Even the music is at a perfect volume to enjoy and augment the ambience but not too loud, as other places often are, as to make conversation difficult; and it's thankfully chosen by the management, not a jukebox at the mercy of the patrons. The playlist was enjoyed by myself, and my son and his buddy, age range 21-64, that's no small feat. Plenty of TV monitors are situated around the room to keep up with the latest sporting events as well. The rates and food/drink prices are very competitive, especially considering the high level of the accommodations. The non-smoking atmosphere is also a huge positive that can't be overstated. I can't think of any negatives to mention, my only hope is that when they get video poker that it's limited to the bar area and not located by the tables. Griff's should be right at the top of any list of best pool rooms in Las Vegas, it's not even close. In fact, anyone even contemplating going anywhere else could be rightfully ruled mentally incompetent and subject to confinement for their own protection. Check out Griff's, TODAY!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for a great time! You have the pros, champs, music, delicious food - what more do you need?!"}
{"text":"Guess how I found Griff's??? By yelping of course! We wanted to find a cool place to play billiards that was also not full of funky smoke. Well this is it! Griff's is a very classy spot to go for a great game of pool. It makes an impressive first date or date night also. If you want to go to a place where you and friends or that special someone can actually have the space and the breathing room to enjoy yourselves then check it out. It's nicely laid out, roomy, and completely SMOKE FREE. They have a full bar, kitchen, serve awesome wings, beer, snacks and have fantastic lunch specials as well. On Fridays and Saturdays they have live music. The band that played last night. D&D Entertainment, was all of that! The music was banging! They did the best 80's and 90's live music that went perfect with the atmosphere. I love playing pool, but many of the spots are just stinky dive bars. Griff's is like the spot! Clean all around including the restrooms. Bring a group or grab your sweetie and come play some pool and watch the game all at the same time. Lot's of tvs centered around the place so every table is a good seat in the house."}
{"text":"OMG!! Stay away!! I sat in a dirty toilet seat. Just eeek! We use to love coming here and wind down after work . But it's gone downhill. The food and cleanliness has also degraded. I'm thinking it my be safer just to buy fast food at this point."}
{"text":"decided to come check out this bar after hearing a Craigslist ad, The employees were friendly, everything is super nice inside and you can tell they spent alot of money fixing up this place. Lost a star because there was something wrong with the music that night I think, the speakers kept going in and out or something was skipping. they eventually turned it off luckily, and I just played music from my phone since there wasn't very many people there. Will be back with more friends next time."}
{"text":"We ordered food from here off of Bite Squad who lost track of their driver and we ended up waiting over 2 hours to get our order. All that is a Bite Squad issue. When we called the resaraunt and asked what was going on they advised of Bite Squad's mishap and said they would be remaking the order fresh for a new driver to pick up. They were very patient and kind and the demeanor of the guy who answered the phone was pleasant and helpful.   We ordered 2 burgers, the spicy burger and the Jack Daniels burger with a couple sides of potato salad. The food arrived hot  (which actually pleasantly surprised me) and the burgers tasted amazing!! The potato salad was great until I found a giant piece of blackened rotten potato. Even with that, the employees made the experience much better than it was first turning out to be and the burgers are worth it, they definitely rank in top 10 for me! I also recently discovered they are also a pool hall (billiards)! I can't wait to visit!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to shoot pool without the smoke and found this gem. It's clean and there are tons of tables. Service is great, too!"}
{"text":"Its a pool hall, the best pool hall in Vegas though. I wouldn't go here for drinks and dinner unless I was playing pool though. The staff is friendly, I didn't notice a pro shop which would be nice here."}
{"text":"I love this place to shoot pool in Vegas ever since they changed from pool sharks. It used to be a dive but new owner renovated the whole place and made it real classy pool hall. Nice and clean and stylish with white leather bar stools ( and they are comfortable). Tables are clean and cue sticks are straight and good quality.   Food is good as well. Nice and spacious and clean air since they don't allow smoking inside.  Marcus our bartender was top notch.  He knew drinks well and his customer skill was impeccable.  Suprising to find a bartender like him at a pool hall. Excellent excellent."}
{"text":"When I first heard about this smoke free billiards place, I knew I had to pay a visit. On Decatur near Twain, parking was not an issue on a Wednesday night around 7pm. We walked in and were immediately greeted by the bartender who asked if we wanted a table and what size. Standard or 9 ft. We weren't sure, but went for the smaller table. I'm short and didn't feel like sprawling on a large table! She gave us the cue ball and told us our table number.  First thing we noticed looking at the pool floor was that it was quiet. There were about 7 tables in front with players, but they were focused. It might have been a league. Since I've never seen league play, I don't know if that's the etiquette...or maybe it just happened to be a bunch of serious players. In any case, I liked that atmosphere. Music and TVs weren't too loud either.   The server was attentive and I liked that she checked on us a few times while we played. I will come back again since I want to become a pool shark  I'm just a guppy now, but with some practice, I hope to become an adolescent. I recommend this place if you want a clean, smoke free place to shoot pool. They also serve food, but we didn't order anything from the menu - maybe next time. The tables were $10/hour so it's a fun, affordable way to spend a few hours."}
{"text":"From out of town and this is a great pool hall. Good food, great tables (tight), and good people."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for all ages, pretty big and well setup everything is clean a well kept, fully stock bar and large menu of food to choose from. Best pool/sports bar I've been to."}
{"text":"This place looks way better than it did before. I walked in and was truly amazed. I usually don't like pool halls because of the way they are designed here. I was having an awesome time playing pool until the server came over to us to offer us drinks, we ordered, and asked about the food, she responded \"kitchens closed\", with an attitude and walked away before we could say never mind about the drinks, since we wanted them with food not without. We looked for her to cancel and couldn't find her so we canceled at the bar. She then finds us and tells us \"you're paying for your drinks whether you like it or NOT\"... it was honestly the rudest thing any server has ever said. It's not like we weren't going to pay for the drinks we ordered since we couldn't find her to cancel, she didn't have to be so rude. I probably won't return here. Customer service is everything whether the place looks nice or not."}
{"text":"Great non smoking pool hall. Super comfy seats and great pool tables and sticks. The music level is perfect and happy hour specials are awesome. A+ for Griffs"}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect for a pool hall, simple fast service at the bar, solid door staff, and lots of well-lit and well-maintained tables.  See you there"}
{"text":"Great pool, great service, great beers in draft, great food and good music. Lots of tvs and all around cool place!"}
{"text":"We had a company outing here and it was perfect. The food they made was delicious. Attentive bar service too. It was awesome being in a non-smoking venue in Vegas."}
{"text":"Well it's been a few months since I was here last. This time I brought my bro-in-law Robert to play some pool and he was blown away at how great Griff's looked like. He remember the the old place called pool sharks and it was very smokey and the food wasn't that great either. He's impressed that Griff's has also non smoking and a full menu the gal Aileen the bartender was very help ful as to what to drink also she remembered what I like to drink and its been like 6 months. I've been coming here since it opened and I'm still happy to co.e here to play pool or just to watch a sporting event too. That have karaoke as well on Fridays i think."}
{"text":"Non Smoking, Full Bar, Good Sized Menu, Friendly Staff.. what more could you want?   The tables are kept in good condition and I love the atmosphere of this room. Hats off to the owner for the complete overhaul from its previous Pool Sharks days.  NICE WORK GRIFFS!"}
{"text":"Eager to check out the pool hall where the US Open is held, and get some dinner, I brought my family along to Griff's. My parents have very severe food allergies, so taking them out to eat anywhere can be an ordeal.   After explaining the restrictions to our waitress, the cook himself came out to talk to us and figure out what on the menu they could eat safely. The level of service we got was above and beyond what you'd get at a typical fancy restaurant. At a pool hall, that's almost unheard of.   The food was delicious, the table we played on was very nice, and the atmosphere of the hall is great. It's non-smoking, which is much appreciated, and as a result I could totally see spending several hours there playing pool. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in after work, early afternoon, on Sunday. First impression was great. The place had tons of people playing pool, but the tables for diners were wide open. I was greeted and offered a beer right away. I browsed the menu, and just couldn't resist trying the Cuban sandwich with a side of onion rings. Both the sandwich and onion rings were amazing. My only complaint would be that the menu listed the sandwich as having dijon on it, but the cook must've forgot about it, because it wasn't there. I would totally order it again though. Great service. Great food. Great atmosphere. If I get stuck in Vegas for work again, I'll definitely head back to Griff's."}
{"text":"Worst bar I've walked into. Sat for 10 minutes without being acknowledged. I don't recommend this place at all and I sure love going to bars and I've never left a review before but I had to now for the first time."}
{"text":"I played at an event here over the past weekend and let me tell you, this is a top notch pool room.  the tables played great, the staff was awesome & very responsive, and the food was delicious (I recommend the grilled chicken sandwich).  Places like this will change the long standing stigma of the past....the dingy, smoke-filled pool room filled with undesirables...:)  This is the future of pool and all are welcome!  I can't wait to return next time I am in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best pool hall in Vegas! Friendly staff, very good quality tables and cue, good selection of beers and fried food and great value. Multiple TVs to watch sports. Super fun -- thanks you!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful room, very clean restrooms, delicious food and convenient phone chargers located everywhere!"}
{"text":"Poor management, the food wasn't what I expected. The only thing that kept us there was the selection of tables and our server was super sweet. For the life of me can't remember her name but she was from the Philippines! I won't be going back."}
