{"text":"Came in for a late lunch on a Saturday. Wonderful bartender and amazing ribs! The maple BBQ sauce is awesome and the ribs were crunchy, juicy and tender all at the same time! Was my first time eating here but sure won't be my last!"}
{"text":"First time trying this pace and will be back. Had a group of 12 and service was great.  Kudos to Rachel for doing a great job.  My beer glass never went empty.  Great recommendations, the BBQ shrimp and home fries were very good."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch - good food, good beer, good value, friendly staff.  Try the maple bbq sauce,  great with the pulled pork sandwich.  Would definitely stop by the next time we're in Chardon."}
{"text":"My favorite place, great food.  Happy hour beer specials and the staff that make this place feel like almost home.  I would like to see happy hour food specials. Just saying."}
{"text":"Stopped in last week for bbq.  Really good food, good service, pretty nice size beer selections. Nice summer patio too."}
{"text":"Excellent neighborhood bar and eatery. Friendly staff, great prices, and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We walked in around 3:45 pm on a Monday. We asked to be seated on the patio, and the bartender was snarky. She complained to other patrons (loudly) that she didn't want us to sit there because she was the only person working. We walked right back out. Unfriendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"A GEM on the east side. These are the ribs we have been searching for all over Cleveland! Tender, meaty, fall off the bone ribs  with GREAT array of homemade sauces....the maple ones are my fav. Would give it 5 stars but the ribs are good and inconsistently, GREAT.  We have gone on Sunday , since it is 10% off slabs, and both slabs were tougher and more burnt than before....."}
{"text":"Had plenty of fresh popped corn. Hi ordered a patty melt and fries.big patty served hot with onions.fries were hot and crisp.very tasty sll for 12.00 with a coke"}
{"text":"The ribs here are amazing as is most of the food I have had. The new owner has nicely updated and upgraded both the inside and outside of this place. It's a great place to have a few drinks or gorge yourself on food. From the service and drinks to the food and atmosphere I've only had positive experiences. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We go here 3-4 times a month. We love their BBQ, and wings. We can't find a place we like better for wings. Great staff too. Always very friendly"}
{"text":"Lived in the area for 40 years..Finally tried this place.  The place is sorta of dive, but omg, the food is absolutely amazing...Ribs, 5 star, my husband has had the 1/2 chicken, crazy good, and he had a burger another visit.  He is a burger connoisseur and said it is the top 3 he has tried on the east side of Cleveland.  Well staffed, so the service is very good and attentive.  This is now our go-to restaurant on a weekly basis...."}
{"text":"We stopped here after visiting Holden Arboretum, and I must say it does look like a hole-in-the-wall place, but don't let appearances fool you! This place was hopping with locals, our waitress was friendly and patient (love the warm welcome, smiles, and attentive service), and the food was pretty dang good!  It is a bit dark inside, and there is nothing fancy about this place, but they have plenty of tv's, free popcorn to much on, and delicious BBQ.   On Sunday's they have 10% off BBQ so I went with the ribs and pulled pork $14.99 and it came with two sides (coleslaw and garlic parm fries) and garlic bread. My date went with the BBQ chicken breasts $9.99 and got regular fries and mac & cheese. They make all of their own sauces and they have a ton of them, but the waitress will let you sample some to help you decide. I went with the sweet & spicy for my ribs, the golden BBQ for my pork, and the spicy ranch (definitely has a kick!) for dipping my fries in. My ribs had a wonderful crispy bark on them, they weren't huge (and watch out for that cartilage), but my mouth really enjoyed eating them. Pulled pork tasted awesome with that golden BBQ sauce (it's a mustard base) and I enjoyed the homemade cream based coleslaw as well (came out in the same 3-4oz containers that the sauce came in so don't expect gluttonous portions). Fries are fresh cut which is always great in my book. I had a bite of the white \"gourmet\" mac & cheese and it was just okay, but my date enjoyed it. He also liked the tender chicken that he got.   This place is pretty far from where I live, but if in the neighborhood again I would definitely hit it up!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal at Maple City Taps & Eatery!  We started with the wings as an appetizer with the Maple BBQ sauce the wings were meaty and crispy - with just the right amount of the delicious sauce.  Some of the best wings I have had.  Our table had the BBQ ribs and BBQ pizza.  All were delicious!   The sauces for the ribs (selected by each individual) were excellent and the ribs were moist and tender.  The pizza was delicious and the dough was great.    Definitely worth the try!!!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ - Good Gumbo - Good God clean the place up. C'mon people - sweep the floor and remove the cobwebs from the ceiling. I'm a fan of dive bar ambiance but dirty - no thanks.  The BBQ is quite tasty for these parts, the fries mushy and wishy washy, cole slaw just okay. I will be back and hopefully someone decides to don a clean rag and a vacuum cleaner and do a bit of housework."}
{"text":"Stopped in this afternoon about 2:15 after driving past this place multiple times. It's a little rural roadside bar just outside of Chardon. Don't expect a posh establishment, but instead character and you won't be disappointed. It is not big inside, but also has a deck with outside seating in nicer weather. The place opened at 2:00, but the kitchen doesn't open until 4:00, so we were unable to try the food. The atmosphere was cozy and was sort of like a European pub the way it had low wood beam ceilings. It appeared clean as did the restrooms. There were many TVs that could be viewed from anywhere within. I was VERY impressed with the liquor selection for such a small bar and our tab for 6 rocks pours, 3 mid shelf and 3 top shelf was only $38. There was an ample beer selection on tap with about 9/12 being craft beers. Rachael, the bar tender, was very friendly and eager to assist. I considered it busy for 2:30 on a Tuesday. There was a self serve popcorn machine. We did look at the menu and plan to return after 4pm soon so we can try it some. They said they smoke their own pork. I recommend a stop for the bar selection, atmosphere and service and may upgrade the star rating once I've sampled some of their food.  Update: we returned today, 11/4, and sampled the food. The fresh cut fries were very good (hard to mess those up!) and we had the hot maple wings. The wings were VERY large and meaty. The skin could have been a little crispier to be perfect. The sauce was flavorful with a distinct maple flavor but only a slight heat. The sauce was a bit runny to stick enough to the wing. The price was pretty comparable to similar establishments. Once again, the service was excellent! The music sucked today though, Ha!  Returned again and tried the BBQ pizza with the pulled pork. The crust was excellent with a nice flavor, a crisp to it with a chewy center. The pizza's flavor was great. I would just recommend adding the pork toward the end of cooking since it's already smoked. I upgraded this establishment to 4 stars today based on their consistency. The service has been excellent and the food worth the stop. The bar selection is also vast."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! It's not much to look at, but the food is simply the best.   I get the same thing every time I go, their pulled pork platter. The pork is so delicious, especially when you pair it with one of their home made maple based BBQ sauces.   I went to another BBQ place in Chesterland (one that is rate really well by the Food Network) and Maple City blows them away! I can't wait to go back to Maple City!"}
{"text":"Wings were good- ordered the Hot Maple wings- sauce was very good. Also had the fresh cut fries- solid fries. Overall food and drink is good. Service good too. Too much country music playing - although that is just a personal preference."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Friendly staff. Tuesday is $6 pizza night and it is great."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place. Older dive bar with killer BBQ  Their ribs are the best around.. Try the maple hot wingsx you don't be disappointed! Great drink specials, great menu pricing. Have never left unsatisfied"}
{"text":"A hidden gem maybe? I'd say definitely! Was out visiting family and they took us here. So glad they did! My 5 year old niece says chicken wings are her favorite food and she can eat 28. 28! After sitting next to her at dinner here, she is correct. I saw her do it.   Really really tasty food. I can't wait to come back. Chicken wings, fries, pizza, pulled pork - yum."}
{"text":"Drove by this place a few weeks ago and wanted to stop.  Looks like my kinda place.  Imagine Roadhouse without Swayze and his flowing mullet.  Brad Wesley would send his henchmen in here for sure.  Other reviewers said the wings are dope so thats what I had.  Got them breaded joints and they were pretty good.  The hot maple sauce was really good.  Maybe a dusting of cayanne before the sauce dunk would give it better texture and more heat.  C & C Music Factory isn't the only one that make ya wanna sweat.  They had Snowdrift Vanilla Porter for 2.00.  In these neck of the woods dark beer is too much for most.  Keep it light and fizzy.  The beers were still fresh and I drank the hell outa 'em.  Place was packed with locals and the bartenders were nice.  Only thing thats dropping stars for me is the bullshit pop country they played the WHOLE time we were there.  Were not 12 year old girls shopping and tanning at the mall.  The place was full of adults and I wished they would of played better tunes.  God, I cant wait till this country music crap goes away.  Hank, Bill and Johnny would be rolling over in their graves...."}
{"text":"I'll start the review with the better part of the visit.  The food was good.  It wasn't great but I enjoyed the ribs and Maple barbecue sauce. The boneless skinless chicken breast with the Rancho sauce wasn't anything special. In fact, it could have been a frozen chicken breast heated up then slathered in sauce.   My wife had the Maple Chicken sandwich. She also felt her chicken breast was frozen due some of the tough parts in the meat.  Normally, I'd consider going back just for the ribs but everything else we experienced during our Saturday dinner visit will prevent me from going back.  It was busy, whether that was normal for the Saturday dinner rush or not I don't know, and there was a sign that said to seat ourselves. We took a quick stroll through the restaurant and found only one empty table, which was right next to the women's restroom and the pool table and bowling machine.  Not only were we stuck in probably the worst table in the joint, the table was uneven and filthy, but not as filthy as the rest of the place. Literally, my chicken breast, which was brought out after my ribs and on a separate plate, was sliding toward the edge of the table. I used to watch live bands there many years ago. I'm pretty sure it was cleaner back then when it was a dive bar.  It still smelled the same...stale beer.  The floor was disgusting as well. They have popcorn available at the front of the restaurant. If you're too lazy to get up to fill your bowl you can scrape some off the floor. I'm pretty sure that's what the guy in the kitchen does. When I saw him, he was stuffing his mouth with food with his left hand and digging a spoon out of the trash can with his other hand. Yes, he was digging a spoon out of the trash can.  Later, this same guy was out salting the stairs thanks to a spring snowstorm then returned directly to the kitchen with his big bag of salt and dirty clothes.  Now to the service.  Again, the place was busy. But, that's no excuse for just being rude.  We seated ourselves and waited a few minutes for our server to address us. That wasn't an issue.   She slowed just enough to take our drink order. Had she stopped and said hello she may have noticed how filthy the table was.  When she delivered our food she didn't ask if we needed anything else and she didn't return until it was time to bring our bill.  I was eating ribs. It would have been nice to have an extra napkin. I guess that was too much to ask.  Overall, the food was good enough to warrant two stars. But, unless you like to eat in filth you might want to consider another option.  I think the place needs to decide if it's going to be a dive bar or a restaurant. Either is OK but it's hard to have both. You can't have disgusting people working in the kitchen and violating health codes.  On the restaurant's web site it says, \"Our friendly, warm staff, delicious Cleveland Bar-b-que and beer selections will make you want to keep  coming back! \"  The friendly, warm staff part isn't accurate. Delicious barbecue was a bit of a stretch, but the ribs certainly were good. I had a Guinness...can't screw that up.  Geauga County doesn't have many quality restaurants. The list of potentials shrunk even more after this visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here on the regular. We absolutely love the staff, the selection of beer, and just the atmosphere all around.   We go here the most during lent when they offer the absolute best fish fry in town. However, my husband swears he cannot find a better tasting pizza then their white pizza with sausage and jalapeños.   Oh, and the free endless popcorn doesn't help.  If you are looking for a local bar with amazing bar food, a fun atmosphere for game nights, and just a chill environment, look no further than Maple City Taps & Eatery!"}
{"text":"Good value around chardon. Food was good, the hot maple wings were really something special. Nice bar with great food and $2 draft special"}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday around 430pm to beat any dinner rush. Ribs were reheated from the day before. Realized after I left that the 16 hours of smoke didn't occur the day I was there. The ribs were sauced then grilled, burnt actually, acrid char on most of them.  Several hairs were found on two of our rib entrees. Beans were soupy and flavorless. Mac and cheese was served cold. Despite the several problems with our dinners the server did not bother to discount our meals. I would go back but only for wings and fries. At least these would be fried to order."}
{"text":"Oh man , where do i start? The pizzas are out of this world!! The maple BBQ sauce is amazing!! You can't go wrong with any dish!!   My parents are weekly regulars here. I wish I was able to go as much as them! They have really turned this place around!!"}
{"text":"Pass this place all the time coming to and from work. Decided to stop. BBQ ribs with Sweet Maple sauce was awesome!  Very generous portions. Very friendly wait staff. Good value."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the outside but definitely worth a try. My family and I were in the area and decided to stop in here for a quick bite - we were not expecting much, but were pleasantly surprised! There was plenty of seating on the inside with a ton of TVs (we're really into the Olympics so it was fun to watch while we ate). It's also worth mentioning that they were playing some really good music. They had a fun popcorn machine with baskets for each table that you could munch on while waiting for your meal to arrive. We tried the pulled pork sandwich, the Philly cheesesteak and Bonfire wings. The pulled pork was delicious and tender. You get to pick from a variety of house made BBQ sauces - I played it safe and went with the original. It had some spice to it, but I put my side of coleslaw right on top of my sandwich and it balanced everything out perfectly. The other menu items we tried were great as well. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is a place that has gone thru some changes over the years.  It used to be a real dive with irregular service and on again off again food.  But in the last few years has turned into our regular place for a nice inexpensive dinner out.  It is known for its ribs and smoked meats but the burgers and wings are fantastic too.  It's an inexpensive restaurant but service now is spot on and food is consistent.  Plus there's free popcorn when you walk in the door.  If you're in the ares it is not to be missed."}
{"text":"very impressed with this local bar. Came in after volunteering at Vintage ohio and they still were serving their full menu at 10pm.  huge salads and hand cut fries. a rib and chicken dinner with 2 sides and a roll $14"}
