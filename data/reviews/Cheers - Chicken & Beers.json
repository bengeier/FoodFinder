{"text":"Really good Korean fried chicken, very similar to The Fry that's nearby on Yonge but without the lineup. Been there twice now and tried the chicken with green onion and the original. Both were very good. As a bonus, the ttukbokki (rice cakes) is super spicy and I only had the medium! Good friendly service. Not too busy yet as it just opened several weeks ago."}
{"text":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.  

Service: maybe the music was too loud, the cashier seemed to have problem understanding English.

Food: I ordered half green onion chicken, my usual favorite at The Fry.  I don't know how this place can claim themselves as Korean Fried Chicken, because they did NOT double fry, leaving the batter thing and quickly turn sauggy.  The meat had no flavor, just plain chicken. 

Will not return and don't recommend."}
{"text":"I was eager to try Cheers as my Korean food-loving friends dined there 3 times in the span of a week. The space was big enough to readily accommodate our group of 10 people. And they're open very late! 

We ordered the original ddukbokki (ricecakes) with cheese which was spicy, cheesy, saucy, and full of rice cake pieces and buckwheat noodles. Any leftover sauce can be used as a dipping sauce for chicken, fries or onion rings.  I really enjoyed the chewy texture of the rice cakes but due to my low threshold for spice, I could only manage a couple of pieces. The cheese corn we ordered helped cut the spiciness of the ddokbokki but it was not as cheesy as I had imagined.

Cheers' main draw however is definitely their chicken. They offer bone-in chicken, drumsticks and wings, and boneless chicken bites. We ordered their boneless chicken bites with the garlic soy flavoured sauce (which had lots of pieces of sliced fried garlic in it) that are deliciously  juicy and yet crispy with an almost caramelized consistency.  The addition of fried rice cakes to our orders of chicken added another satisfying textural dimension. 

Our orders of chicken came with several types of banchan (side dishes), like pickled radish, cabbage slaw, and a creamy spicy penne pasta. Orders of chicken can be purchased as a combo with Sapporo, beer, or soju. I don't tend to drink alcohol much but the green grape and grapefruit flavoured sojus were sweet, refreshing and dangerously tasty. The grape soju was like drinking a spiked grape juice and the grapefruit soju reminded me of the taste of gin and tonic.

For years I've been disappointed with other KFC (Korean fried chicken) places in Toronto that served chicken that fell disappointingly short of the crispy double-fried, caramelized wings I had had at famous Korean chicken wings places in NYC. Finally I have found a go-to Korean chicken place in Toronto to satisfy my cravings!"}
{"text":"This was the place which is good in enjoying.
It was a great of the service of the employee.
Taste? Awesome!!
I seem to fall in love this place"}
{"text":"I love Cheers! Food are amazing here haha Especially how they have different signature sauces (my favorite is soy) for chicken menus. Also I tried Korean army soup for the first time. It was little bit spicy for me but I loved It! I would recommend it to someone who likes to try new things in the restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Be careful when ordering food to go, ordered takeout after work and it took about 45 minutes to get 3 tiny dishes. They really need to work on their customer service and speed. Food was ok nothing that special, I think that The Fry is better. It was super pricey."}
{"text":"Really like the garlic soy here. It doesn't have that harsh aftertaste that quite a few Korean chains have. Also the chicken is fried really crispy without being dry inside! There aren't a lot of tables here but it seems like there aren't many customers unfortunately. I didn't think the fries add on is worth it because there weren't many fries and there's nothing special."}
{"text":"There are so many Korean Fried Chicken joints popping up around Toronto especially near Yonge/Finch and Yonge/Sheppard area. I've tried Mymy Chicken, Home of Hot Taste, The Fry, Dakgogi and probably others I cannot recall. 

The menu is pretty standard which offers different kinds of fried chicken including combos with beer, stews, appetizers, etc. It was nearly empty when we arrived and throughout our meal less than half the restaurant was full (on a Friday evening). 

My boyfriend and I ordered the Half Chicken with green onions and the Ddubboki (added sausage and cheese - additional 3$ each). We also ordered a pitcher of beer as well. We received free popcorn and \"ban chan\" which consisted of radish, spicy pasta and cabbage salad. 

The fried chicken was delicious. Perfectly crisp and juicy, not over cooked at all. It was freshly made and went perfectly with the green onions. It also went well with the cabbage salad. 4 stars for the fried chicken but the Ddubboki is another story. The Ddubboki was over cooked and broke when we tried to pick it up. The dish was overwhelmed with a lot of sauce that you could barely see the ingredients. In addition to what we added, there was thin noodles, fish cakes and onions in the dish. The dish lacked depth and not what I usually enjoy, I've had Ddubboki many times but this was just not good. This is at best 2 stars. 

Oh and service was fine, she was friendly and checked up on us every so often. Her English was fine as well, I recall reading a review where a servers English wasn't very good but I guess it depends when you go. 

Overall, I recommend this place for chicken and beer - don't bother trying the other items. We tried and it wasn't even available."}
{"text":"Probably ranks last out of 3 KFC joints at Yonge and Sheppard. Way too dark that I couldnt even see the menu. Service is okay. Kind of slow but reasonable. The food is between decent and good.  I would not return as there are better KFC options."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with friends last night, this is one of many Korean style fried chicken restaurants in this area.

For our group of 4 we ordered two whole chickens. The chicken was very crunchy yet also very tender and they have great sauces to go with it. About $30 for a whole chicken, but you can also choose to have boneless or wings, but we just went with regular chicken. It was a lot of food and we had to pack it home.

Fries were kinda blah, so I wouldn't get them next time. 

If you check in on social media you get a free pop so we got 4 cans of Coke too!"}
{"text":"Korean fried chicken is always a good idea! And here they make it crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside with a light coating of soy garlic glaze.

The atmosphere is friendly, the waitstaff attentive and the food amazing!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok for me. 

It's a really nice, small restaurant and it's sort of tucked away on Shepard just off of yonge so it's not as busy as some other similar restaurants. We walked in on a Friday night and only about 4-5 tables were filled. It's a dark restaurant but quite cozy and modern, music is a bit loud so it's not ideal for having a quiet dinner. 

Service was ok, we didn't get the popcorn because apparently that's just for people who order drinks, that's fine but I think it would be nice to include it for everyone. Drinks aren't overly expensive and they have daily deals for food and drinks as well. 

We ordered the corn cheese and the half and half chicken with half original and half chili sauce. The chicken was not bad, but honestly I think the fry is better, the portion sizes are also better at the fry for around the same price. The chicken also came with a few side dishes like pickled radish, a coleslaw type salad and a few noodles of pasta salad which were spicy and quite good but it was literally 4-5 noodles in a bowl. 

We weren't asked if we wanted refills of the side dishes, and really no one came by at all to ask if we were ok or needed anything which is why I removed some stars as well. 

I do like that they have daily specials and a lot more variety on their menu than other KFC places including some inexpensive add-ons like fries and onion rings to complete the meal as well as a number of other entree dishes aside from just the chicken. They also have oven chicken which I suppose might be a healthier option. 

I do just think it's ok though, and will probably continue to go to the fry when I'm craving KFC."}
{"text":"Compared to other great KFC nearby, i wouldn't put this place as my first choice, heres why
- my wait for the order was 35-40 minutes which is ridiculous
- nice service but not attentive enough. No water was given or asked if we need something to drink. The food came out after a long time but no explanation or sorry? Or is this the expected wait time here ? Im not sure
- the fries came along with the chicken is very bland and not crispy, don't even bother. 
- menu has greater options but seems very overpriced. 
- the half and half soy chicken + spicy chicken is actually decent. Chicken is not overly battered but still crispy. The pieces are big especially the drum sticks. The flavour is standard not incredibly bold. The spicy chicken is spicy but its at a handleable level for me which is great because u can still enjoy the meal where the spiciness is not too overpowered. 
- also got the kimchi tofu and spam dish which is expensive ($15) for the smaller portion. Kimchi is somehow on the sweeter side but i still enjoyed thoroughly although i expected it to taste like regular kimchi. Spam instead of pork belly isn't really a nice upgrade for me I'm not thrilled about this 

Overall, not bad and very average compared to the range of great fried chicken along this area."}
{"text":"Chicken and Beers...

That's probably the only thing you should order at Cheers anyway. 

Korean Fried Chicken so good. We shared the half and half (Soy and Spicy) chicken. I love the option of picking either chicken bone in, boneless, drumsticks and wings. I think I would opt for drumsticks or wings only, since I am more a dark meat lover.

Make sure to order side rice cake ($4) as the fried rice cake has this perfect chewiness and really soaked up all the spicy sauce. 

Wait time is at least 15 minute for your food as they are all made when order.  And it is definitely worth the wait as the batter is so light, super crispy skin and moist chicken meat!

There are also daily special and 5% off when paying cash. 

Service is OK as the wait staff is friendly but not too attentive. But I have to thank them for being extra welcoming to the toddler at our table. He was offered a complimentary basket of onion rings and pop."}
