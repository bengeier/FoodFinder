{"text":"had dinner there - ordered the international sampler and thought it was good but i wish i just ordered one thing. i didn't love the hummus so much, but the italian (lasagna?) was quite delicious! i noticed on the smoothie/juice menu that you can add honey or bee pollen, which isn't vegan. ok ok, i'm not vegan either, but i used to be and the mixed messages bother me! :) that said, it was good and probably the healthiest option in this crazy town of all you can eat fattening buffets."}
{"text":"Hands down best raw food in Las Vegas, you really can't go wrong. I'm not even a raw-foodist, but I can't argue deliciousness. If you're like me and you're new to eating raw or if raw food isn't exactly your scene, there's plenty for you to enjoy without having to try anything new. Their extensive list of 28 smoothies doesn't disappoint. These hearty meals in a cup can be a great breakfast on-the-go!! At Go Raw, they don't filler your drinks with ice and syrup, it's all 100% pure organic ingredients....and it's good too!! Don't be scared, you don't have to be a hippie or adopt an Eastern philosophy to find something here you like. In short, give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Faulty prices. Employees shrugging their shoulders when you ask them about faulty prices. even worse when you don't care about your customers, that's how you lose a customer. I'm all about supporting small businesses ... TUPS down the way will receive all of my word of mouth business. As a general manager of a Best of Las Vegas 5 Star company, this irritates the hell out of me ."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Smoothies are definitely worth it, the menu is pretty pricey but people will pay the same thing for fast food etc.. This was totally worth it!! Loved that they have lots of non-gmo, cruelty friendly supplements. So many good reads too!!!"}
{"text":"Ask for Mini she rocks!!! It was our first time at a raw vegan joint. We have totally gone off the meat since we watched \"forks over knives\" a movie that blows your meaty mind! Go Raw is a fresh choice and a store/library all rolled into one. Get the mexi sampler or the purple burrito. It's awesomelicious!!! Live to Eat people!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place about 15x, and always get the salad bar.   It's quite unique, in that everything is raw, fresh, and very healthy.   There are unusual offerings (such as kale and homemade dressings), that really make it worth the fairly high price.  You feel like a million bucks after eating here.    So, it's not just about taste (yes, burgers are probably more delicious).   But, that's raw food."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at the cafe on Eastern Ave. I have tried raw food a few times before,  including a takeout from Whole Foods, and this was much, much better. I had the \" cheeseburger \" and \"fries\" (which are coated avocado slices) and enjoyed them both. What's more both my husband and I had a very filling meal, weren't hungry later and had plenty of energy. The next morning I didn't seem to have the crankiness I often wake up with. This was also the first raw food that didn't sink to the bottom of my stomach and lie there. There is no atmosphere at this place and the service is minimal. There will also be no hot food. And the food will be nothing like what you might expect, but it is quite tasty, very satisfying and, for one who tries to eat very little wheat flour, it's fun to just be able to order anything I want."}
{"text":"Amazing raw vegan restaurant and juice bar.  They have raw versions of dishes like cheeseburgers, meatloaf, fries, lasagna, etc... all made with raw fruits, veggies, nuts and grains.  They don't exactly taste like the originals, but you won't care when you taste them!  It is all so delicious and you can just feel all the good enzymes flowing through your body after you've eaten.  Beautiful presentation- each dish looks like a colorful art work.  I would reccommend just about anything on the menu but lately I love the veggie wrap.  If you're not so adventurous, just try their house salad- it's the bomb.    One thing is the staff always seem hesitant to bring water if you ask for it!  On multiple occasions they just haven't brought the water I ordered.  Maybe it's because drinking with a meal is supposed to be bad for digestion and they don't want to encourage it?  But, if you order one of their fresh juices, of course they'll bring that.  There always seem to be different people working there everytime I come in, too, not many familiar faces.  But the food is always excellent.  Prices are reasonable for the quality of food you get; expect to spend 7 to 15 bucks.  They also have a little store area where you can buy books about healthy eating, vitamins and herbs, raw and vegan snacks and more.  And, while you eat, you can gaze out at the beautiful \"lake\"... make sure to check out the lego house right across!  Such a treat to have a place like this in Vegas, especially after living in Berkeley and getting used to having tons of healthy vegan places to eat."}
{"text":"Best green zing juice! Plenty of take out snacks. Best chipotle Kale chips.  I'm back, and it's just as awesome as I remembered.  Although I'm on yet _another_ cleanse, I broke down and had a lot of food as mentioned above and below.  I sampled the pizza thing - the crust was a flat bread made with almonds and seeds, finally a bread without buckwheat!  I also had their desserts, WOW.  The dark chocolate heart with almonds and currants, to die for and I don't like chocolate and I'm allergic...eek.  I also had the fudge which is really nuts and seeds in a bar, sweet and lovely.  Filling, and still eating some now.  Fabulous.  A double bonus is that they soak all their nuts and seeds for easier digestibility and absorption and less fattening! =)  Yes, ladies we can enjoy a little and not feel too guilty.  Everything is fresh and made on the spot.  The staff are so friendly, just love them.  It's not your upscale place like NYC's Pure Food and Wine, but the food and people are great.  They have take out snacks, desserts, books, supplements, drinks and even t-shirts with their logo.  They occasionally hold raw food preparation classes too.  Whenever I'm in Las Vegas, you'll definitely find me here!"}
{"text":"This is the East side location for the Go Raw cafe.  If you saw my review for the West side, then you know this is an amazing raw cafe in Las Vegas!!!  Yes, you can still be healthy and retain your raw vegan status while in Sin city.  Just get your green juice, raw entree, raw desserts and whatever snacks you desire from flax chips to raw cookies, and you're all set to go.  No Vegas trip will be complete without my daily visits!"}
{"text":"So yummy! Service was attentive and very nice. We had the Mediterranean pizza and was delish. I wish we had one of these is Phoenix, I would go all the time!"}
{"text":"Go raw cafe is the only place I've found that's even relatively close that provides completely raw, vegan, organic food, and they do a pretty good job imitating some of the dishes we were used to eating growing up (most of us anyway, unless your parents were hippies... In which case, I'm jealous). But yes, in case you didn't put two and two together, raw = no cooking. Expect cold things. I love their variety of juices and smoothies, and the ones I've tried have all been quite good. Yes it is on the pricier side but they also offer half orders on a handful of their dishes (still a lot of food) and, I mean, what do you expect? The foods are more expensive in a grocery store for organic, so organic meals are obviously going to cost more.  The layout could definitely use a makeover. You would think considering the food they provide, and various things on the walls, that they'd want good feng shui or something."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and eat a lot of vegan food.  I've never been a \"fan\" of the raw food movement, because it's never been tasty (or overly appealing).  Go Raw Cafe will change your mind.  My husband (the pickiest of eaters and I can safely say a vegetarian junk foodie) and I both LOVED the food here, we were just shocked that it was all raw.  Try the Mexican sampler plate or the International Sampler plate to get an idea of what you like.  Of course, you could go to the salad bar, but it's just salad.  Let them cook.. erm, prepare for you!  The chili was also just amazing, full of beans and almost a curry finish.  The gentleman working the cash register was incredibly nice and helpful.  There are a bunch of cookbooks to check out while waiting (I ended up buying two, I'm a believer!) and of course, some pretty tasty desserts."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since probably 2003. I prefer to make my raw dishes at home but recently returned for a date night and was very impressed!  This place has really improved over the years, as far as the variety of food and recipes go!  I brought a non-raw friend and he was fighting me over my italian sampler plate. The zuchinni spaghetti was amazing!!! It tasted better than the real thing and better than I can make at home.  On another recent trip I got the sushi. The serving was so big it lasted me two meals.  And can't forget their hamburgers! (raw food vegan but taste better than the real thing!). Whenever I a craving an unhealthy burger I hurry up and get down here right away! Their hamburgers are so good it always does the trick. The bun is made of dehydrated sprouted grain bread. When you have condiments that are real food - the flavors are so much more intense.  If you are looking for some of the raw prepared packaged foods like raw chips and tortillas they are a few dollars cheaper here than they are at whole foods.  They have a few shelves of pre-packaged raw fooda, supplements, and drinks like kombucha.  They have a great raw food salad bar that always has lot of unique variety like raw dressings, soups, and tropical fruit.   They make fresh vegetable juices and smoothies, with optional superfood supplements.  There is a large selection of books on nutrition and raw food.  They sometimes have raw desserts like cheesecake that are to die for.  5 stars for the selection, quality of food, and their excellent improvement to recipes."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and probably have tried everything on the menu. I ALWAYS get the Mexi-Cali Platter and a Body Cleanser juice. Support local spots like this place. They need to stay in business, so I can get my yummy food and juice!"}
{"text":"I was happy to find this spot on my trip to Sin City. The Strip is clearly not on the health conscious side so this place was a godsend (8 miles away from the strip).  The food here is 100% organic and the price is so reasonable. I love this place, I wish there was one out here in Southern California!!!!  I got the small fresh garlic juice and Gimme the Beet \"Cheese\" Burger w/ Fries. Everything was tasty and the portions are huge!  Their strawberry cheesecake wasn't made in the store so that was a bummer but at least they had dessert. The packaged Raw Makery strawberry cheesecake brand was yum.  The next time I'm in Vegas, I want to try the Vegi-cotti or Lasgana."}
{"text":"The juices here are interestingly delicious and I could easily become addicted to them.  I could have one twice a day.      This is a veggie heaven in Las Vegas, where it is tough to find something healthy to eat.  The restaurant is hard to find, even with a GPS and just a few wobbly tables inside a store front, but the food is yummy.  This is a great place to come when you need a healthy alternative after a night of overindulgence.  If I lived in Vegas, I would probably do take-out, but the the woman who served us was very sweet, and I enjoyed our conversation."}
{"text":"I love eating at Go Raw cafe.  The food is always fresh, delicious, beautifully presented.  Their house salad is the best that I have eaten anywhere.  The beet burger is my other fave as well as any smoothie on their menu.....I've tried them all.  I've always found the employees to be helpful and pleasant  What I love the most is how very good I feel after eating here. Listen to your body....it always tells the true story."}
{"text":"Delicious options with a full juice bar, smoothie bar, and salad bar. They also offer a menu of options. All organic, and vegan. Thy offer a bookcase of informative reads as well as all essential oils and vitamins. We need more places like this everywhere! Man at the register with a grey pony tail was amazing and sweet. Great customer service."}
{"text":"The food and salad bar are great, and portions are generous. I was fine with the semi-high prices given the quality and I know a lot of work goes linto preparing raw food. However, they charged me $ 5 for tea which is obscene and it left a bad taste in my mouth despite the delicious and healthy food I had eaten."}
{"text":"Great place to get a juice! Anytime I'm in Vegas in business I stop by and get a veggie juice."}
{"text":"Went twice these past two weeks. Got the \"calcyum\" juice, with kale, parsley, carrot, and apple. It was pretty good and a healthy alternative to the fast food options nearby. Also, they are really fast compared to other juice bars I've visited. My only gripe is with the service. Never really that friendly or engaging. On my last visit they wouldn't let me pay with debit, I guess the machine was busted. So, I paid with cash, received no receipt, and realised after getting in my car and heading to work that they had charged me $11 for one juice, twice the actual price. Kicking myself for not speaking up when I thought it sounded high. I will probably still pop in for a juice once in a while, because at the end of the day you go for the product. It's just a shame they don't put any focus into quality customer service."}
{"text":"Traveling for work and came across this gem for dinner.  Wow! Amazing food. So fresh and delicious. I ordered the Raw Salad with house and cilantro dressing on the side. I will definitely come back!  The store was clean and it didn't take long at all. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant in Vegas! The raw beet burger is the best veggie burger I've ever had! :)"}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but then when I make my own raw food meals, it costs a lot as well. Great, great food, love the purple burrito and the variety of food. Ambience needs some improvement, but the selection is great. Love this place. Always drop by when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food and I like the fact it is all vegan food with a lot of healthy options. However, many things are way too expensive. Juices and smoothies for example are ridiculously overpriced. The atmosphere is very basic and uninviting so this is more of a place to pick up great vegan food and take home."}
{"text":"Went into Raw Food Cafe today to get a juice and I was denied.  The door was open, people were in there, I saw the veggies.  But when I went to the counter the girl said \"no\" the air conditioning was out and they were going to close.  I don't think it would have been a big deal to throw some veg into the juicer,  but she preferred to turn away a customer.  I probably will not go back."}
{"text":"Has to be one of the best raw food cafe I've been! They have books, gourmet raw packaged stuff, supplements, anything you need, really! Its raw heaven.   I had the green juice and bruschetta (half size is one big bread worth!). Because they use cucumber in the juice, I thought it was too watery for my taste, but they do not add water and they juice to order :D Bruschetta is raw bread w almond cheese and garlicy tomatoes, YUM!!!  ALL ORGANIC and RAW + vegan, gf. BEST!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place; I go every time I'm in Vegas. Had the raw vegan \"Purple Burrito \" yesterday along with the green #5 juice. Talk about a punch in the face of nutrition! Nothing better to detox your body after a beer or two (or too many) than a visit to Go Raw. Until next time!"}
{"text":"This place is ok.  Like another reviewer said not great by L.A. standards.  The service is also below par"}
{"text":"Very flavorful.  Great preparation. Great choices. And lots of food.  Wonderful (and raw .   . . BONUS!)"}
{"text":"The smoothies were amazing!  Yes, it has a healthy fresh food smell as you walk in, but it's enjoyable.  The food was delicious and was great to try something new.  I had the Mediterranean pizza and my husband tried their version of burger and fries...be aware that the smoothies will fill you up, so don't order too much after that.  As others said, it's a little pricey, but you get what you pay for.   If we were in the area, I'd think about stopping by again."}
{"text":"Cute place, love that it's right next to the lake.. Kinda makes you forget that you're in the desert for a bit.. Ordered the house granola and Neat Loaf with avocado \"fries\". I almost gave this review 4 stars because they were out of sea kelp \"pasta\", which I've had at a restaurant in Hawaii and love! But the mock meat loaf was so savory and delicious, I figured it was meant to be and I think actually love it even more!! Going vegan is one thing, finding good raw vegan food, takes the challenge to another level. I couldn't believe the \"meat loaf\" was all raw. It had a very good mushroom gravy type of flavor.. Very impressed. Looking forward to going back to try a sea kelp pasta dish! :)"}
{"text":"The first thing I will say about this place is that you have to be open-minded when you go into it!  I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when I came here and I'd never had raw vegan food, so it sounded as boring to me as it probably does to you right now as you look up whether or not it's worth going out of your way for.  In addition, it's in the very back corner of a small strip mall by a \"lake\" in northwest Las Vegas.  However, as soon as I saw the \"People Love Us on Yelp!\" sticker on the front door, I knew it would be better than my expectations (which, to be quite honest, I didn't have many upon my arrival).  It was completely empty inside except for a couple of staff members, and it was a nice, cozy atmosphere with some beautiful art on the walls, a small little raw food snack store of sorts (more like a little closet than anything) and a little room of food-based books, natural oils, etc.  It was fun to look at all of these items as I waited for my food.  As far as the food itself, I was very impressed by the Vegi-cotti.  It was full of flavor and tasted better than any manicotti I've had in a long time.  The Vegi-cotti was served with a side of \"pasta primavera\" which was also amazingly flavorful, fresh, and the texture was excellent.  The price was also quite reasonable considering the amount and quality of the food (it's about what you'd pay at any other restaurant in the Las Vegas area for a meal - about ~$10/plate). The only thing I wasn't really expecting was just how dense the food ended up feeling.  I ate the entire plate (I got the half order) and that may not have been the best decision - but it was delicious and I couldn't help myself!  They also have a \"raw makery\" where they make their own raw \"baked\" goods of sorts.  These are kind of pricey, but also very tasty.  I got the \"yam yum\" cookie ($2.88), and was not disappointed.  It tasted kind of like a spicey pumpkin pie in a chewy cookie form. I just wish I could afford more!"}
{"text":"I ordered the carrot avocado soup and the \"neat\"loaf plate. Interesting flavors and textures. The lady working, Minnie, was very friendly and helpful. The juice we ordered wasn't very good--it was a green one with apples, ginger, and lemon. I couldn't taste the apples and it predominantly tasted of celery.   I took home a young coconut from the fridge and it was so yummy! Best part of the meal."}
{"text":"I checked this place out recently after watching a documentary called Forks Over Knives and I attempting to increase the amount of raw plants in my diet. What I believe was the owner of this place greeted me and continued to give me a lot of information about the lifestyle, he was polite and informed. I would recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Dang...  I was really excited to find this little place as options for vegan dining are rather slim in Vegas.   Food was okay... Had the lasagna and it was an interesting blend of flavors that became somewhat overpowering towards the end.   Portion sizes were WAY too small and the price was WAY TOO MUCH.   The biggest disappointment was the service. Upon walking in I found the employees sitting together at a table in the back and had to ask if it was \"seat yourself\". After a few minutes I was asked if I was ready to order... Wasn't asked if I wanted anything to drink... Just asked if I was ready to order.   Once I got my food it was as if I was forgotten as I never was approached by any of the 3 employees working for nearly 20 minutes.   I finally had to get up and ask for a refill on my tiny 8 oz glass of water.   When it came time to pay the server literally stood next to my table until I filled out my debit cars slip and signed it and then she immediately took it off the table and disappeared never to be seen again.   Very disappointed as this place has so much potential in an untapped market."}
{"text":"we've been patrons for over 5 years.  i continue to support them because the pros outweigh the cons. im really happy there is at least one restaurant in vegas like this. it would be a shame if there wasn't even one place that catered to raw organic diets..  i do think they could train they're staff, particularly a couple of them to be more friendly.  also a few times our veggie wraps were not completely washed free of dirt...but if you ever have a problem w/ your food they'll fix it if you ask."}
{"text":"As a raw vegan I'm always searching out raw cafe's when I'm on the road.  I knew I was going to be in Vegas for several weeks and Go Raw was on my radar even before I arrived.  I have to say, I was disappointed on so many levels.  When we arrived for lunch at the cafe no one greeted us although we saw 2 employees when we walked in.  We kinda just stood there and lingered not really knowing what to do.  So I asked the guy if we should have a seat and he said yes.  So we went and sat down.  And waited and waited and waited and waited.  Finally, we got back up and when back to the counter we started at and asked if we could go ahead and order.  Seriously.  How awkward.  At this point my husband said he had already seen/experienced enough and decided not to order anything (turns out, smart move). I, of course, held out hopes that things would improve and ordered the beet burger.  Not good.  Why in the world they would place soft ingredients (the beet burger was soft and mushy) inside a hard shell (flax seed bread)?  With each bite all the ingredients would squirt out the other side and I spent the entire meal with food squeezing out between my fingers and all over the place.  In addition, before even taking my first bite I had to pick out all the spoiled lettuce.  And when I say spoiled I mean brown and mushy.  GROSS.  GROSS.  GROSS.  The flavor of the burger wasn't good.  Too many odd flavors mushed together.  And I'm pretty sure the tomato ketchup was spoiled because it talked back to me all day and night and even started coming up (sorry) when I went to bed.  Something was definitely off."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while I was in Vegas. This place was great. I love the cafe/nutrition shop. They offer a large selection of raw foods, books, body care, and vitamins. My friend ordered the Mediterranean Wrap and I had the salad bar. Both were tasty. The cilantro dressing from the salad bar was really good."}
{"text":"All I have tried so far is amazing! My fave is the Mexicali Sampler. I couldn't believe how good the  Enchilada was the first time I tried it! The \"Fudge\" made for a great healthy dessert."}
{"text":"If there was a chain of this place so many people would be vegan :) On our short trip to Vegas we came here twice. Got the Italian sampler and the Mexican sampler. Everything was scrumptious!  Even my taco bell loving husband couldn't deny how fresh and flavorful everything was. We got to try 4 or 5 things in Each of the sampler platters. The desserts were bomb too! Before we got back on the plane we took food and a bunch of the crackers, tortillas and chips with us. I don't like the gluttony of buffets on the strip but I'll look forward to coming back here next time I'm in town! Or better yet, make this chain PLEASE!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. raw vegan food does take a little getting used to but it is good. The inside is comfortable and nice. The service is fast and the smothies and juices are great"}
{"text":"Everyone that I've ever taken here has loved it. It's all raw vegan, which is great if you want a \"healthy reset\" for your body. The food is always beautiful and so colorful! I especially love the sushi, \"salmon\" cakes, & zucchini pasta. I still need to try the other foods, but I hear good things about them.  The wait for the food takes a while, but that's to be expected when they're prepping everything fresh from when you order it. The people that work here are always so pleasant!  I also love the snack bars and books they sell here, too. Great for when you want something raw on the go."}
{"text":"Simply incredible! Upon arrival the young waiter greeted us with great positive energy. We placed an order of the beet burger w/ a house salad, the carrot avocado soup and a piña-colada smoothie. The house salad was to die for..so fresh with the best dressing. Well worth the wit for this nutritious energy-filled living food. I left go raw with a feeling of lightness. Can't wait to try the raw desserts next time! If your looking to eat raw this is the place!"}
{"text":"Go Raw has the best smoothies. My favorites are the Superfood Smoothie (chocolate heaven and good for you) and the coconut durian smoothie. Some are want to poo-poo the durian but to me it's pure heaven in a cup and when mixed with the coconut it is out of sight. Dyno-mite! Possibly my only regret in leaving Las Vegas is that I can no longer partake of Go Raw's exceptional deliciousness like the house salad. The 1/2 size is plenty for any reasonable human to eat and it's a great deal. This labor intensive dish is made with love and care. In addition to the food (did I mention the world's best guacamole!?) they have talks, classes, and demos much of which is free plus books and products. If you are serious about changing your life and becoming raw vegan (a beautiful, spiritual way of living) or you just love a lovely smoothie this is the place to try. You never know. It may cause all of your wildest dreams to come to fruition."}
{"text":"Visiting from LA for a youth athletic tournament and enjoyed Go Raw Cafe. It was wonderful!  Five stars all the way.  Healthful, tasty food that was as colorful and attractive as it was delicious.  Great service too.  In LA we eat at Real Food Daily and True Food Kitchen periodically.  Go Raw Cafe food is 100% on par with those other restaurants.  Lower prices, but a more casual decor than those other places as well.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I recently moved down to Vegas from Washington and I was very glad to find a vegan friendly place like I was used to in Washington. The staff is very nice, the salad bar is great, and their service is fast. I didn't get a chance to explore their vitamin wall because my food was out within minutes. Great place!"}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! I was on a road trip and sick of fast food, so I suggested something healthy. After asking around, they recommended us to the Go Raw Cafe. I was a little scared to try raw food, as I've never had it before, but one bite and I was in LOVE! The girl who worked there was extremely helpful; she told us all about raw and what foods we might like. Everything was so delicious. The environment was very relaxed and clean, and it seemed like everyone knew each other. I want to go back again!"}
{"text":"Raw, vegan food sounds scary to the uninitiated.  Nothing is cooked, no animal products are used=what the hell am I going to eat? But, do not be afraid, the raw-foodist vegans will not hurt you. You may even really, really like their food.  The menu at Go Raw resembles most american restaurants.  They have sandwiches, salads, smoothies, \"burgers,\" etc.  The ingredients, however, are a bit different.  For example, the \"living bread\" used for the burgers and pizzas is not really bread, and it's alive (but dehydrated -- it's not crawling around your plate).  Go Raw also does not use animal products whatsoever, so, their \"sour dream\" ain't your grandma's sour cream (meaning no cows involved).  My go-to favorites are the Purple Burrito, purple cabbage wrapped around veggies, guacamole and and salsa. Soo tasty and healthy.  I also love the Mexicali Sampler which allows you to taste several entrees such as the Enchiladas, Mexi Toast, Flax Crax, and Mexi Wrap.   If you're looking for safe bets, try the pizzas, sandwiches, or \"burgers.\"    I may sound like a total wacko, but, whenever I eat at Go Raw, I feel totally energized for the rest of my day.  I love bloody, bloody meat but I get why the raw foodists swear by this stuff.  My only criticisms are that the food is crazy salty and the food takes forreeevvverr to get.  I realize the saltiness is probably to make up for the fact that nothing is cooked, but, damn, I drink a lot of water after eating here.  Regardless, Go Raw is great for someone looking for healthy food that is actually delicious as well.    P.S. - If you're a first timer, try the Westside location, it's, in my opinion, better than the Windmill location."}
{"text":"For the vegans and glutens-free among us, this is where the party happens. Salad bar looked absolutely incredible, as did the mini-market of raw, vegan goodies just inside the door. You have a tough decision between the beet burger and the pizza. Transcendent, both of them. If you could only see our faces the moments we took our 1st bites... Let me put it this way: we didn't speak for the entire meal. N.B. Skip the dessert cups; ain't worth it."}
{"text":"Go raw cafe is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!  I love both locations too- eastern had a salad bar that is amazing!  And the lakes has gorgeous scenery!  Both locations have the most personable staff and they are so knowledgable and helpful!   Get the hummus it's hands down my favorite of all time.  The kale and Mediterranean salads are great and the wraps are my favorite!! The mexi wrap is heaven in your mouth!    I love go raw cafe!"}
{"text":"I gave 5 stars because I don't have anything negative to say. I don't eat raw or vegan, but just trying to incorporate it in my life to be healthier. I got the veggie wrap to go and  the house salad  and both were tasty and filling :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I are runners, and we eat mostly a vegetarian diet with exceptions here and there.  We sometimes run through the Lakes and have passed Go Raw a few times, so it was nice to finally stop and see what was going on in there.    The interior is small and divided into three parts: the dining area, the kitchen and the gift shop.  We figured out that we were to grab a menu and seat ourselves, so we sat by the window (through the blinds you have a view of the lake) and took our time looking over all of our options.  We both ordered smoothies (strawberry/banana/dates and coconut/banana/dates with something else that I can't remember) which were great.    For our meals, my husband ordered the Mediterranean wrap: all sorts of tasty things wrapped up in collard greens.  I ordered the purple burrito - it is not what I was expecting, but I ate all of it: half a purple cabbage filled with hummus and other things.  All raw.  All good, but maybe it was too dense for one dish as I had a hard time digesting that meal.  I think that specific combination of dense raw foods combined with fruit was wrong for me personally.  The way we combine certain raw foods is something I never thought about before, and I didn't realize there were so many food theories regarding this topic.  All very interesting.  I will be more mindful of this in the future.  The gift shop offered a selection of books, vegan health bars and other vegan products.  Since the food does take time to prepare, it was nice to be able to get up and browse for awhile.    Overall, this was a unique little spot that I was glad to find.  The small staff did seem to be in their own little world in the kitchen, but that was ok.  Very casual.  Come to try something new.  I'll definitely be back for more smoothies."}
{"text":"While I was planning a week long business trip to Vegas, I tried to find healthy vegetarian restaurants in advance and came across this restaurant.  The high prices didn't bother me because my company was paying for it, but it was the service that ruined it for me.  For starters, there were 2 or 3 ladies there who barely spoke english and it took them a while to come to the register to greet me.  So I order 1 enchilada $8.80) and a 2 oz shot of wheat grass (menu said $1.80 for 1 oz and $3 for 2 oz).  I went to pay and the lady told me to eat and pay later in case I want to buy something else.  So I eat my enchilada, drink my wheatgrass, and go up to pay and it was $16 and some change!  I asked why it was so much (not that I REALLY cared, haha) and she said $8.80 for the enchilada and $6 for 2 oz of wheatgrass.  Apparently they have \"updated\" prices on the wall in an inconspicuous area and the prices on the menu are no longer valid.  It made no reference to the updated prices on the menu and the sign with the wheatgrass price didn't make reference to it being an \"updated\" price.  After a couple of minutes back and forth and the cashier telling me that her owner wasn't there and that I needed to pay $6 for the wheatgrass.  It ended with me paying her $3 and giving her my phone number so the owner can call me if he dares to try to dispute this.  This started out as a place where I planned on eating lunch every day during this trip, and now it's a place that I have no plan on ever revisiting.    Side note:  I went to get a smoothie at Tropical Smoothie Cafe after I left (because I didn't want to pay (have my company pay) the $8 they were asking for a smoothie, and they had 2 oz of wheatgrass for $2.75."}
{"text":"I went with a friend and ordered the raw burger, which was ok. The house salad that came with the burger was AMAZING though. Best salad I have ever had. The food wasn't the problem, it was the older gentleman that works there. He came to the table to ask us how the food was, we told him it was fine. But then he tried to convince me to spray some kind of salt spray on my food to try it out.(There are bottles of this spray on all the tables) I'm not a big salt person so I said \"No, thank you, it's just great the way it is.\" He pushed even more for me to try it. I just wanted to enjoy my food and have my conversation with my friend. After I told him very nicely that I wasn't interested in trying it, he mumbled a bunch of stuff. The only thing I made out clearly was \"I guess you're going to eat your food the way YOU WANT to, that's fine.\" Which I found incredibly rude. There was a lady about 1 feet away waiting for a juice she ordered who saw and heard the whole thing. She gave me a \"what was that about\" kind of look.   Not the best experience. I won't be returning. Which is a shame, because that sure was one delicious salad."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.   I have been going there for years now.  They have the best Vegan food, they get so creative with their dishes and make them a lot of fun to eat!  They sell the highest quaulity supplements and vitamins.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"always fresh, home made, no preservatives dishes! prices are very good, meals are healthy and tasty!  recommend to everyone - vegans, vegetarians and curious ones : don't be afraid to ask a questions over there, they are very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Vegan and raw food extraordinaire! A great little place tucked away in a tiny shopping center. I ordered the veggie wrap which had an awesome pesto, almond cheese, veggies, and an avocado handsomely wrapped in a collard green. So good. It was fresh, delicious and left me feeling comfortably full. I had the blueberry cheesecake too. I'm hoping to get back there again while in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love the idea of a raw food restaurant, but this place is super pricey. The two different smoothies I got here were terrible for how much it cost! They were warm first off and the durian smoothie literally tastes like onions blended in a custard. Maybe might have been better if it haven't been warm. I also got the sushi and they drowned it in some liquid. And it just became WAY too soggy to enjoy. If it hadn't been drowned it would have been decent. But the price of it all is what I disliked the most. I will give this place another try but I'll have to ask for specific things like ice in a smoothie or not to drown my food."}
{"text":"Totally dig the food here.  Especially the fat free cookies. Great place for daily lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in here the other day and had a lovely experience. I was feeling under the weather with the beginnings of a cold / funk. The kindness and care I received was second to none. While this cafe specializes in raw, I wanted some hot food and they suggested the cooked vegetable curry soup. It was a generous portion and seemed nutritionally balanced with brown rice, veggies, and legumes. Warming and delicious, just what I needed in a vegan comfort food. We all need different nutrition at times, so I really appreciated the cooked option.  I also let the waitstaff recommend a juice to boost my immune system with a little spice to help clear my head cold. The tomato-spicy one was delicious and pure, just enough cayenne heat. The flavors were really well balanced.  While the ambiance is not exactly warm and fuzzy -- it has more of a supplements store or grocery feeling -- the people are wonderful, the food is pure, and I was filled with gratitude that we have such great options for vegan and vegetarian / pure food in Las Vegas.  I think a lot of heart goes into this business! The pricing seems reasonable when you think about the volume of fresh / pure ingredients they have to source, and how food prices have been going up. Of course being mostly raw, the food is different and the textures and temperatures may not be what people expect if they are coming from the standard american diet, but I recommend giving it a try, perhaps in stages.  P.S. the kale chips in the take-home packaging are completely wonderful and delicious! Get some on your way out!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, a nice combination of flavors and textures.  I had the manicotti and my husband had the \"salmon.\"  We were both very pleased  Go into the ladies room, very nice paintings wall paintings."}
{"text":"I deliberated writing this review for a few weeks, because I understand how important a business' reputation is and how crappy it is to get slammed by anonymous online commenters.  The food here, especially the juice, is above one star.  I could even look past the slowness of the service because of how long it takes to make raw food by hand.  However, the fact that a co-worker and I who had essentially the same meal both got sick in the same way tells me there's a serious problem here - even if it only happened once and we were the only people to ever get ill.  On August 5, I went here with three other co-workers.  It was not my idea, but I encouraged us all to go because I'm into juicing and otherwise trying to be healthy.  I had the mexi-wrap, with others having the portobello wrap, the faux tuna sushi, and the neatloaf.  The food itself was okay, but I can't give an honest assessment of it because it's now mentally associated with how sick it made me.  The co-workers who had the neatloaf and sushi were fine.  Later in the day, the co-worker who had the portobello wrap developed a bad headache, and I believe some stomach pain as well, and left work earlier than normal.  He later told me that he ended up having terrible light sensitivity and vomiting.  Later that night, I was the sickest I had been since the middle of college (for reference, I'm an '07 grad).  I'll spare the details, but it was terrible, and kept me up much of the night.  Worse, I was almost totally incapacitated the next day.  I barely had the energy to get around my apartment, let alone get to the office.  I did about a combined hour of work that day at home.  In fairness, I didn't get a medical examination to conclude that it was the food at Go Raw that made me sick.  But, it is an incredible coincidence that both my co-worker and I, who had meals there that had common ingredients (including the collard greens the wraps are made with), got sick at almost the same time in nearly the exact same way.  Based on my conversation with him, Go Raw was the only out-of-the-ordinary thing he ate that day. I know it was the same for me.  I'm not a food scientist, but when two people have nearly identical symptoms right after doing the same out-of-the-ordinary activity, I think the evidence points to that meal making them sick.  While food sickness can happen anywhere and to anyone, the circumstances of me and my co-worker both getting so sick, so acutely, and in such a brutal way, leads me to believe that this is more than my stomach simply not agreeing with something.  It is worth noting that my other co-workers who went did not get sick.  Based on these Yelp reviews, apparently a lot of people enjoy and have had good experiences at Go Raw.  I hoped to be one of them, but I am not."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had the salad bar on both occasions. The bar offers a nice selection and there is no doubting the freshness of the selections.   What I don't like is the price. The place is very expensive. Yeah, it's organic, etc. but one healthy run at the salad bar is north of $15.00. I'm also not terribly impressed with the staff which seems to be hit and miss in terms of friendliness."}
{"text":"I'm here a lot. Why? They have fresh vegetable and fruit juices for a reasonable price.   While I focus on juices, they also have smoothies and prepared dishes. This is a raw food focused establishment (hence the title). They offer steamed vegetables in the hot bar along with soups and brown rice, but I believe those are the only selections that are cooked at Go Raw Cafe.  Don't discount them if you are a carnivore. This is simply a place to come and get healthy, whole foods. No matter what food plan you are following, we can all agree that getting more raw vegetables in our diet is a good thing. Come and try out the salad bar and grab a raw food cookbook. On Saturdays and some Sundays there is a jazz flutist. You read the right, a jazz flutists. His beautiful music just adds to the ambiance of the place.  Interested in finding a place to practice yoga, learn how to do a proper kettlebell swing, meditate at dawn? Check out the community board and you will find at least two notices that appeal to your particular healthy interests.   I've read a few reviews where people were put off by poor customer service. I won't defend that and I have to admit I have witnessed it on one occasion. But the 100 other times I have been there, I have seen kind and helpful employees assisting patrons. The owner is always busy but totally interested in helping any customer who asks find a book, or understand the benefits of a plant-based diet. He is passionate about the raw food message and it shows in the energy he invests in this business.  I appreciate the food offerings and the message of this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh artfully prepared food delighted my senses.  Large portions. I debated whether to eat half and save half for later but I couldn't help myself. I devoured their signature \"burger\". I wish I could take go raw cafe home with me to AZ. Fast friendly service.  Calm peaceful atmosphere/ambience. Healthy Eating Books  and prepackaged raw food grocery nook as well. Outdoor seating by the lake. Go!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I that I sometimes choose to eat a vegetarian diet.  I sometimes consume meat, but try to keep it to a minimum, strictly because it's a healthier way to live -- not from any moral considerations.  When I do eat meat I try to avoid, if possible, meat that has been tainted with nitrates, antibiotics, and hormones.  I wish there were more restaurants in Las Vegas that catered specifically to vegans and vegetarians.  Many restaurants offer vegan and vegetarian options, but my Internet search turned up only one restaurant in town that does not serve meat at all -- the Go Raw Cafe.  After greatly enjoying a vegetarian Thanksgiving with Tofurkey bought from Whole Foods, I wanted to continue my meatless streak at the Go Raw Cafe.  The first thing I noticed was a flyer that had been placed on every table advertising pressure acupuncture.  There was also a bulletin board and counter near the entrance covered with business cards and other flyers.  I wasn't wearing my glasses, but squinting I could make out that one of the flyers was promoting the healing power of crystals.  There was also a book nook that I browsed briefly while waiting for my order to arrive.  One book was all about The Lemonade Diet.  You get the gist.  Why is it that so many natural/health food restaurants and markets are in bed with pseudo-science, Eastern culture, and New Age mysticism?   Perhaps it's the health food crowd's general mistrust of mainstream culture that results in a gratuitous openness to anything that seems to be a counter-culture alternative to the mainstream.  The irony is that whether the pedlar is selling cheese burgers, snake oil, or scientifically-unsound books touting fad diets, the profit-motive remains the same.  It is the stealthy hand of corporate culture that tries to tempt the health food crowd with non-mainstream offerings.  I think there must be marketing research which suggests that health food advocates are susceptible to buying anything that appears to be outside of mainstream culture, as long as it makes attractive claims to improve our physical and spiritual health.  It's pretty insulting, if you ask me.  But none of that is a critique of the Go Raw Cafe.  Just an observation.  On to the dining experience.  Our waiter started by asking my dining partner and me if we had been there before.  When learning that we had not, he provided us with some luke-warm recommendations of a couple of things that he liked all right, and warned us about some other things that he didn't care for, but which some people apparently do like.  It almost seemed as if he were apologizing in advance for the menu.  Seeing as the Smoothies and Veggie Juices were in the range of $6 to $9 each, we just ordered a couple of waters with lemon to start with.  The tepid waiter brought our waters in small plastic glasses without ice.  My dining partner's lemon wedge was all skin and no pulp.   We decided to split the International Sampler and a half-order of the vegi-cotti.  I was looking forward to the hummus and garlic bread sticks that were part of the International Sampler.  But when our food arrived, I couldn't see or taste any hummus anywhere.  Maybe it was inside of the Mexi Wrap, or mixed in with the Pasta?  As for the garlic bread sticks, there were four of them, stuck upright into the pasta.  They were about the length of a finger with only half the girth.  They were crisp, barely flavored, and gone in six bites.  The pasta primavera that came with the vegi-cotti looked almost identical to the pasta that came with the International Sampler, but there was a very subtle difference in taste.  The taste of the food was unusual, but not unpleasant.  It was interesting, but not exciting.    I never had any hesitation or reluctance about eating the food because I knew it was healthy and wholesome.  But I eat healthy, wholesome meals all the time without having to sacrifice good taste and delicious flavors. One can eat healthy and also enjoy it. This food was merely edible.  It didn't taste like shit.  It wasn't repulsive.  But this is not high praise.   The menu was also overpriced given the moderate serving portions.  You don't get a lot of food for the price you pay.  Our meal came to $26, and we had no leftovers.   The best I can say about the Go Raw Cafe is that it serves healthy, edible food.  But it is under-seasoned and overpriced, and I have no desire to go back there."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time a few weeks ago while visiting a friend.  It definitely was filling and tasty.  I had one of the wraps which was really good - wrapped in some chard.  I also ordered a veggie soup - not so keen on that - a little too thick for my licking.  All in all, a very good place to go to if you want to eat something healthy and good."}
{"text":"If your looking for healthy food in Vegas, look no further! Everything is fresh, & RAW! I'm not a health nut, & I love a good bloody steak, but we all have to try some rabbit food now & again & this will not disappoint, even super picky eaters like myself. The wraps are huge (a half portion is the same size as a wrrap from most fast food places) & not too pricey, the smothies are AMAZING, & though they are a little overpriced (8 bucks for a drink?!??!?!) its well worth it. I will save a couple trips to starbucks & do my body a favor by coming here more often. They also have a great little reading section & its one of the only places I have found Kombucha, statewide!"}
{"text":"I searched vegan restaurant in las Vegas and up comes everything in the search. Like Prime Rib Loft.... This place is an actual vegetarian and vegan place.  The food is good here. If that kind of food is what you like.  I have eaten at the west restaurant and every here has been good.  Some are for more extreme eaters but if you just want a good house said theirs is fine for normal eaters too. My wife and I have had about 8 different things and all were ok.  Several were great. Two were not my preference. But I tried and ate them ok and would try something else next time. I see some complaints about some of the more extreme meals on this site. All I can say is talk to the waiters.  The first time I went in the manager awaited on us and told me that the juice that I was thinking about was not what I wanted.  It's an old-time hippy interior design inside.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Great place for eating light during the very warm vegas summer !  Lots to read, products to look at and of course great juices and smoothies!"}
{"text":"I've been hitting this place up once a week after yoga. I have to say, the first time I went in here some old guy who I assume is either the owner or a manager of some sort was totally rude and condescending towards me like vegans and raw foodists tend to be when they make the huge ASSumption that someone doesn't \"understand\" their food choices and lifestyle. Not true, mister! I contemplated never going back but ... the food was delicious, it's hard to find places like this in Vegas and I wanted to be the more evolved person. I win.  So, I love the wraps. All of them. The salad bar seems popular though I have never tried it. They also sell a lot of sprouted grain and nut chips, pizza crusts, cookies, etc. So go eat some raw food even if you're not vegan and try to avoid the smarmy, judgey dude."}
{"text":"If you love healthy RAW VEGAN food then this is your kind of place!! I've had a few things from the menu and have yet to be anything other than satisfied. Also have great topical's, books, and vitamins."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the service was excellent. The lady that helped me explained, in great detail, about their menu. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good! This place has tons of delicious raw organic choices.  Thank you yelpers for helping me find this place. so thankful! Try the sampler platters, make your own salad, order the raw lasagna, have fun, Enjoy. Thanks Rod."}
{"text":"loved this place, very sad tomorrow on 12/14/16 is their last day of business :((((((("}
{"text":"First, I should say that coming here made me feel like I was in a spa at a health resort without any pretentiousness whatsoever.  There is such a vibe of healthy living that is exuded here, right down to the jicama \"fries\".  I came on the day I was leaving and we had eaten too recently to order a meal, but I had the Gimme Greens smoothie with soy milk and kale, parsley, celery, cucumber, spinach, and collard greens.  It was one of the best smoothies I have ever had.  The owner is very nice and we chatted while I was in line.   I will definitely be back next time I am in vegas and likely eat many meals here."}
{"text":"On our first visit we noticed a Great menu including smoothies and salad bar... and wonderful selection of high quality products from colloidal silver to extra virgin coconut oil, kombucha to protien powder, books to apricot kernels! Clean, positive atmosphere! Spoke with a customer while there who said she literally eats there every day!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the corner, lovely juice bar. Fun to come here and get a juice and sit by the water. Friendly staff. Lots of different options. I never tried to the food but the juices were great and refreshing."}
{"text":"Went here with a vegan friend who raved about it. As a non-vegan, I'm happy if I can find something that doesn't taste too weird or have bananas in it. This place is great. They have SEVERAL juices and smoothies that are wonderful for vegans, veggies and non-v/v alike. They also have nice salads and a lunch bar that I could easily eat off of for days and not get bored.   The staff is friendly and they have a frequent-eater program if you get hooked on the place. They're really trying for a community vibe, lots of books, flyers, misc stuff...it's nice, but the place was pretty quiet when we went and we were the only table having actual conversation.   Still, I'll be back..."}
{"text":"I tried Go Raw Cafe for the first time today. I had a half sizw Mediterranean salad and bowl of carrot Avocado soup. The portion sizes are huge. both were very tasty and I will definitely be returning. It's a little on the pricey side but it's good, healthy food and lots of it."}
{"text":"Three stars is a gift for this place. Now to be fair, I've only been here once (which is why it gets three stars. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume I had an unusually bad experience). But after the horrid service and so-so food, I never returned and never intend to do so either.    After standing at the register for several minutes to place an order while the waitress stood around talking to the only other person in the cafe, we finally got some service. My boyfriend and I brushed off the first incident and continued looking around at their selection of books and such. We then sat down and FINALLY received our meals after about 35 minutes (again, we were the only customers in the place). The food was pretty good, but what really set me off was the drink. All we wanted were two cups of water. Instead, what did we receive? Two Dixie cups, standing about three inches tall, of room temperature tap water. Seriously? If you're promoting this raw, Earth-friendly lifestyle, why wouldn't you provide reusable cups. Hmm, a glass perhaps?   Needless to say, we finished the water in a single gulp, rushed down the food, and headed out to buy some bottled water next door."}
{"text":"Food is okay - really good smoothies, but it is expensive and the employees are rude and non-personable. I don't know if they always give dirty looks for the sake of dirty looks, or if they are just PO'ed about something. Anyway, salad bar is decent, smoothies are good, everything is expensive."}
{"text":"A little pricey but I enjoy the selection of healthy foods and supplements. I even got tea from here when my wife wasn't feeling well that helped a bit. Salad bar is nice, always we'll kept with fresh food, eating area is always clean, nice laid back atmosphere. I have already become a regular."}
{"text":"I literally cried leaving this place. I just can't even.....  Matt decided to come here for his birthday lunch for some-odd reason. After perusing the menu I decided on the neat loaf and \"fries\" [a lot of things on the menu are in quotes. You will see them used in this review as well.] and Matt got the purple burrito, and we both got two small Fiji waters. The total was over $31! I thought of the CenturyLink internet bill that was around the same price and bit down and paid. I hoped that the food we would get would be delicious and amazing for that price.   Now, before I go into the \"food\" (see what I did there?) section of my review, let me talk about the actual property. It sits right next to The Lakes and is gorgeous. Tons of ducks were gathered outside. When you go in there isn't too much room to move about, and when you get to order you don't quite know where to go. After our orders were taken I guess the guy assumed we had been there before because we got no direction. Finally we saw someone else pay so before our food came out I paid and the woman behind the register was confused since apparently people come up and pay after their meal. Finding the register in the first place was difficult, the place has a very strange layout.   Anyhow, after 15 minutes or so we got our \"food.\" The entire plate looked unappetizing. The neat loaf was just a rectangular-shaped lump of brown stuff, the fries were... well, nothing like fries whatsoever, and two small triangles of the hardest bread ever that should truly come with a warning since I swore I almost chipped a tooth on them. I received some random mixed veggie salad on the side and two pieces of fruit, as well as some orange paste for the \"fries.\" Being completely honest, I couldn't even identify what was on my plate with the exception of the two pieces of fruit. I really tried to be open-minded and started to eat what was on my plate but everything tasted \"off.\" Not a thing on my plate was edible. The flavors that were there were so strange, peculiar, and really hard to describe. I just know that they were terrible. I couldn't eat more than 4 bites before I had had enough. And trust me - this morning I was STARVING and I would much rather prefer to starve than eat here again.  Maybe I'm the crazy one, but I don't think that an oven is necessarily a bad thing. Maybe Matt and I both ordered the wrong thing or should have ordered a (ridiculously priced) smoothie, but I can't believe that anyone in their right mind thinks that what was on my plate was flavorful and tasty. I can't believe I spent $13.88 on a plate of vegetable mush. As a vegan I'm used to eating new things that might not work in theory but this just did not work at all, and at least those questionable items were still edible and identifiable. I was so angry that I just cried instead upon leaving Go Raw and I know for a fact I will never be back."}
{"text":"Love! It's definitely one of my favorite vegan places in town- and I am super picky! My favorite is the Mexi wrap- such great flavor and texture. And it comes in sifferent sizes.  This location (the lakes) is a great spot with beautiful views. I love how it's hidden away."}
{"text":"I am thankful for this place. The only thing if someone like me wants to eat here every day it would be nice to have a daily special. A new exiting menu every year or even 6 months would be nice too. I would like to eat here every day but after couple days I get tired of the same and I just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place could be so much more than it is.  Incredible location, right on the lake; cool art & a nice vibe; and I enjoy the idea of eating well.  A good cleaning would do Go Raw a world of good. Whatever natural cleaning products you'd like to use, and put some muscle into it!  The food is OK & the juices are wonderful.  It would be so much better if the food quality was up there with the juice quality.  I had an apple, beet, carrot and cucumber juice that made me happy all afternoon.  It tasted amazing, fresh and sweet.  However, the bruschetta was like cardboard - my teeth hurt after the first bite - and my salad had wet lettuce in it.  The prices are a bit steep... I paid $14+ for a large salad and regular-sized juice.  There is so much potential here - I hope they can make Go Raw into the cool little (clean) funky restaurant I know it could be."}
{"text":"We visited this place on a Thursday afternoon for lunch. Firstly, we couldnt find the place, as there is no banner that says Go-Raw. They have large signs that say VEGAN! Now, I figured out that there is no way there would be 2 vegan cafes in a strip mall - so we went in, turns out it was the place. It is certainly surprising  that there is one such place in Vegas - which is the town of buffets, steak, sinful food and wastage.   Ambiance: it was somewhat boring. Looked more like a homeopathic clinic or bookstore than a lunch place. The lighting was un-flattering, furniture was boring, decor was average.  Food - Certainly a lot of variety - but perhaps that is the problem here. They had american, Mexican, Italian  and Mediterranean dishes and it is really difficult to come up with so many good combinations, especially if you are planning to Go RAW!  I am comparing with other organic, vegan and raw places, so I am setting my expectations right. I tried the lasagna, and it was horrible. They told me the pasta was made out of Zucchini, I thought it would be something cool and unique - to my disappointment, zucchini was the pasta. The sauce was average and so was the salad. We also tried their beet burger, but the bread (which must have been made out of almond meal or something) was really dry and chewy. The Mediterranean platter has some kind of wraps made of collard greens (sucked), hummus and a cold salad. The hummus tasted, but again - I've had better.   The portions are really huge and so are the prices. When you are eating raw food, the truth is that you wont eat a whole lot - the food energizes you quickly and is leafy and cold so you just dont over-eat. It is a good thing, but its also not food that you want to take away and eat later when it is colder and stale. This place needs to really reduce the amount of dishes on the menu, focus on few good salads and sandwiches and make them really well and tasty.  Service - The waitress didn't seem to care that much, kinda typical vegas attitude. The owner came down to explain the menu options, but no one really came back to check in on us to see if we liked the food, especially considering we were first time customers. There were 1-2 other people in the restaurant but seemed to be there for medicines or books and ate something while they were there."}
{"text":"This food is incredibly delicious. The Mexican plate is amazing. Do yourself a favor and try the blended coffee, too."}
{"text":"This place is bit boring and they are definitely on the high fat and high salt raw food recipes.  But when there are no other choices, and I do like to get my organic juice here.  We still come quiet often."}
{"text":"My fiancée & I relocated from NY to CA and stopped here for dinner. I was excited that he found it.  He ordered the \"Salmon\" Cake & I ordered the Beet Burger. The \"fries\" were made of breaded avocado. We also shared the Berry Good smoothie. The food was very fresh, tasty & filling.  One woman was very friendly and chatty. I believe she was the owner. The menu is on their website. They also sell raw food, supplements and cookbooks.  The only thing that bothered me was that we were crammed into a corner table with a fan blowing right in our faces.  The restaurant is located right next to the water, so I was able to watch two ducks outside the window. They were sitting next to each other & I believe they were on a date. ;)"}
{"text":"The best tasting healthy organic food we ever had. The staff was friendly and helpful. It was great to find healthy satisfying food for the few days we were in Vegas. I wish they had a store by us."}
{"text":"There's a growing number of healthy restaurants in Vegas, but those that deal in raw food are very few- location is hard to find but worth the search. Bonus points for having lakeside seating to dine alfresco!  Menu mostly consists of veggie pasta dishes, buckwheat pizzas,  wraps, soups, and the obligatory salads, juices, and smoothies. Wraps are made with collard green  leaves, and a half order will get you two- the Mexi wrap (nuts, seeds, herbs, guac, and salsa) and the Mediterranean wrap (hummus, sprouts, veggies) are both tasty. I prefer to get half of each to make a solid meal that clocks in just under $15.  Location is a little odd- it's part diner, part bookstore, has the feel of a hippie crystal store, and friendly staff. Parking can be difficult as there are other popular businesses in the plaza but this one is tucked in an awkward corner."}
{"text":"Sadly since moving to Vegas I have not had many vegan choices for restaurants. But I guess I can't compare to LA where the choices are endless.   I love all the smoothies-but I am assuming some are pretty high in calories, especially the ones made my favorite the Pina Cool-Ada and the Vanilla-Bana. I once asked about this calorie question and was told it's only a tablespoon of almonds.   The juices are good too, but pricey. They do have a stamp card, but still. Veggie Cocktail is a version of V-8. Good stuff.   My favorite thing to eat is the Go Raw House Salad. Luckily they sell it at Whole Foods when I am really craving it and don't want to drive to go Raw.   The kale salad is also good. The Gimme the Beet Cheese Burger is good, but the living bread does not do it for me.   \"Salmon\" sushi is good and the Mexicali Sampler, but nothing beats their house salad!"}
{"text":"i loved the mexican pizza.. though thought the prize was a bit on the high side..  food also took some time to make and deliver.. customer service was very friendly and place was clean.  i would have given four stars if not for the price and timing.. but still very tasty!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing. It is a rare restaurant in that they actually care about your health. All the ingredients are chosen for your health...So when you leave, you feel energized. The people working there are good hearted people too. What a combination!"}
{"text":"The food is really good and fresh -- I was surprised as I am not a veg, so this was one of my first times in a shop of this nature. I had the burritto and smoothie, both were fantastic. It's a bit overpriced, but I think they can do that -- considering the time it takes to prepare and the quality of the product. Also, as previously mentioned, time to prepare is a bit lengthy but understandable."}
{"text":"Go Raw is a small cafe that I discovered upon moving into The Lakes housing community about two years ago.  Everything is raw, vegan, and organic.  Because this way of life is more expensive, their prices are quite high but I only frequent Go Raw for one thing - the wheatgrass.  For the past two consecutive weeks I've gone in for the same thing 1-ounce of the grass.  I can now go in and say I want \"the usual\" and they know exactly what I want! The set-up of this venue is slightly awkward and cramped but the staff are friendly and knowledgeable about the raw, organic way of life.  It's not easy to eat healthy in Vegas, so consider Go Raw a great and unique resource."}
{"text":"I love this place. Being from California when vegan restaurants are everywhere i struggled out here to find a place to go out to eat.  Their menu is so yummy and well priced. The samplers are great to share. The juices and fresh pressed and the flavor combinations are unique. Id recommend this to anyone who is a vegan or vegetarian or even just looking to get a pep in their step and try something new"}
{"text":"I always get a weird feeling inside and can't wait to get out. I feel sort of claustrophobic and uncomfortable that I could never even imagine dining there. In fact, it's one of the most uninviting places I have ever been in.  I think the dark and poor layout contributes to a bad flow to the place.   People walk in and don't know what to do or where to pay without guidance from the employees.  I think the employees figure if you were able to find the place then you have been there before.  If you are new to Go Raw Cafe--just head to the cramped area in the back near the bathroom to place your order.  I always wonder if they are still gonna be in business when I drive up.  After looking around my last visit I asked myself why not just get a juice at Whole Foods 5 minutes away??  I made up my mind and I am officially all done with Go Raw Cafe.    They recently put a rack of vitamins in front of the stainless steel bar area which seems so large and out of place.  They also moved the cash register around the corner which is awkward.  It's beginning to feel really cluttered even though there is plenty of space to work with.  They have it laid out horribly.  I used to enjoy my juice outside by the lake but the chairs are always missing and the outdoor trash can is usually over flowing.  I usually get the spicy veggie cocktail, whatever my boyfriend wants, and 2 coconut waters or to-go. The girls have no personality and border on rude...definitely not friendly not matter what day of the week or what worker you get...it's actually kind of strange?  I guess if I was crammed into the back of that cafe to work all day I would be unhappy too.  GO RAW is hidden...with gem potential if they would just hire someone to redesign the layout.  The bar stools at the stainless counter were the only place I ever saw people sitting and that option is gone now.   You can't get a good vantage point on the menu from the small area that is left to place your order from.  If it's busy you can't watch them make your juice because you are in the way....unless you want to peek through the shelves of vitamins.    This place is a wreck and I have seen better use of space in a food truck.  (The photo shows the menu from where you order and the rack I am speaking of is off to the left.)  Dear Owner: Improvements to the inside are beyond needed...at the very least, move that rack.  If you get really CRAZY with renovations the wall near the lake should be all WINDOWS....corner to corner windows...you are a cafe on the water with one of the BEST views in Vegas.  Your space has the greatest potential and you are wasting it.  Your rude and grouchy employees are also hurting your business."}
{"text":"if this rating was only for food it would be 5 stars, however wait times tend to drag and you have to be careful you don't catch Maria on an off day"}
{"text":"The interior is very bright with colors of purple and pink... It smells fresh too when you walk on. So far what I've tried has been delicious! Both food and drink have a nice taste you can't get from many other places around~"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu gets five stars in my opinion.  Neat loaf & \"fries\" superb (trying to find a fancy word for amazing) Liver mover super juice!  Great service on top of it and you get five stars from me!"}
{"text":"I don't even understand how a place like this can exist in Vegas. Stepping in to Go Raw Cafe feels like home to me (Austin, TX) from the lake view to the uneven parking lot to the supplements and homemade bath products on the walls.   The menu is amazing. Mexican pizza is like normal pizza but with totally different ingredients. Sprouting bread! Lettuce wraps! What am I eating? I don't know, but it's delicious. The meals are surprisingly filling as well. Love it!"}
{"text":"I've been vegan for 2 years but not raw. I recently got interested in raw food so when Bob found this place during our trip to Vegas, I was eager to try it and we went for dinner. The results were mixed to say the least.  The atmosphere is very casual and the service lackadaisical. The appetizer of hummus and sprouted bread was awesome, could not have been better. I liked my green juice and Bob loved his multi-juice concoction of carrot, tomato, green, etc. We both ordered lasagna, bec I ordered it first and Bob copied me, and then I refused to change my order to something else. Big mistake.  The lasagne looked good, and parts of it were good. But there was some kind of sauce in it that tasted strangely bitter and sour that was a total turn off. I picked it apart and ate the greens and squash and avoided the yucky sauce. The little salad mix and toast squares were tasty. The food was really filling as others have mentioned so small portions are just what you need.  During the meal, Bob mentioned that he felt like his sinuses were stopping up and we chalked it up to hayfever. We bought a few packaged things from the store to go. On the way back to the hotel, Bob macked on some cinnamon & raisin \"tortillas\" that smelled great but tasted like sand.  The really bad news is that Bob rediscovered a flaxseed allergy that he had only experienced once 10 years ago and had forgotten about,  that within 30 minutes had closed up his throat and made his neck swell up like he was storing nuts for the winter. A trip to the ER and 5.5 hours later, Bob was on the mend from various injections and IV drips (food allergies are nothing to f with as you may know) and we spent another hour finding a CVS pharm that was open and getting prescriptions filled. So much for a fun night out in Vegas.  None of that was the fault of the restaurant but it did put a damper on the experience, not to mention that Bob's newfound sense of adventure to try vegan/raw foods with me has been set back about a decade."}
{"text":"Love the food here it's made with love and very clean and organic. The only complaint I do have is slow service otherwise their fake sushi is delicious!! One of my favorites and also their juices are amazing."}
{"text":"Wow I am the last person on earth to write a Yelp review...better yet a 1 star review. I phone ordered a meal 30 minutes prior to arriving when I arrived my order was not made in the man who took my order was sitting down eating lunch they offered me nothing but they did tell me it was going to take another 10 to 15 minutes to make my wrap. Unbelievable! I work in customer service as a manager at a coffee shop and I couldn't even believe the way I was treated here!!! Never again will I be back"}
{"text":"I was VERY happy to find this restaurant on my recent trip to Las Vagas. It is not a town I can easily eat so Go Raw was a life saver. Not only did they have an interesting menu but the food was fantastic. I want recipes! I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is not the best raw food establishment I have ever been to, but I feel so blessed to have found this hidden gem just outside of sin city. The menu, staff, and ambiance has that healthy, positive, and granola vibe I crave sometimes. Although I am a huge proponent of bacon, sometimes I feel like treating my body well. They have an excellent selection of raw juices, smoothies, and healthy shots. They also have a great salad bar where you can make a healthy salad or steamed veggie platter. They also have a fun menu that includes wraps, enchiladas, and raw pizzas, plus incredible soups. I had the combo dips, a juice blend, I had an E3 shot (only for the masochistic), and their carrot and avocado soup. Everything was good and the staff was really nice. Looking forward to going back asap."}
{"text":"I came in for my first time and the first thing I thought was how awesome it was that they had so many types of items they sold in such a small cute spot. Then I looked at the juice menu since that's what I came in for and their juice recipes seemed very simple and bland, nothing special that I haven't seen before. Plus for just 3 ingredients it was like $6-8 for such a small size. And I understand juicing isn't the cheapest, but I've gone to other places with better juice recipes for better value. Well, despite the pricing, I gave it a shot. I wasn't too sure which to select so I asked the man at the register for some advise between two of the drinks and he has no idea what to tell me. He had to look at the menu and all he did was repeat the ingredients each drink had (which was no help cos I obviously already read their ingredients) so I just went ahead and ordered the Body Cleanser juice and it was only okay. My boyfriend got the Pina Cool-ada and that was alright as well. I think I'll just stick to my other juice spots, this place was just mediocre and not worth it"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place out for a really long time so when I came in, it took me forever to decide since most of their options sounded super appealing. I went with the beet burger which came with avocado \"fries.\" I was nervous to try it since I've never had raw vegan food, but to my surprise, it was yummy and filling! Their prices are a bit high, but that is expected with the ingredients they use and the fact that it is vegan and gluten free. I also got the chocolate chip cheesecake which was so damn good that I wished it was way bigger lol. I really liked the view of the lake and the fact that they have a mini store connected that has all sorts of vegan goodies you can take home for later. I'll definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Excellent vegan food very creative!  It is a little expensive but well worth it! I'm vegetarian and once was vegan. Planning to try vegan once again and this is the best place to go out to eat for that-No worries of any meat or dairy products and anything."}
{"text":"Today was my first time here and I ordered the international sampler, veggie roll and coffee & cream dessert. Everything was so delicious and customer service was friendly! It took a while as I was waiting for my food but I expected it with everything that I ordered and I am glad everything was freshly made. I never knew going vegan can taste this good and filling. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So glad to have found! Hooked on the Vegan Mocha for life!!! The only negative? Terribly expensive. I have cooked raw vegan for myself for years and this is not only expensive but crazy good! What can I say? I didn't have to prepare my meal :) I guess I find that worth it enough to still rate 5 stars...and keep going back. The PB&J Toast and a Vegan Mocha will last me all day with tremendous energy! Tried the Mexican Sampler, which was also good as!"}
{"text":"really great food. although i like their other location better food wise, this location wins in variety and customer service.  i've had almost everything on the menu and i have nothing that i did not like.  amazing!"}
{"text":"They do not open on time.  Worse, they lied about it when I called later. I stood there at 9am and a guy on the inside said they would not be open today. They had no sign posted, nothing. When I called a few hours later, they lied and said they opened at 9am. No, I stood there at 9am. Oh, she said.  I was in the kitchen. Whatever."}
{"text":"My usual vegan lunch spot was closed for the holiday so I had to find a new option.  Thought I'd try some raw deliciousness since I have not been so kind to my body over the New Year's Weekend.    I had a half order of the enchilada and a reg #5 juice (can't recall the name, but I asked for the greenest one).  On the one hand I wasn't crazy about my enchilada.  It was alright, but it's what you would expect going to a Raw Vegan Cafe.  Very earthy and healthy.  Things I love, but a stereotypical experience none the less.  Also, bear in mind I compare this enchilada with the ones from Gracias Madre and Cafe Gratitude in San Fran... and those really are amazing.  So I didn't hate it, but i certainly will be ordering something else next time.    As for my juice, I really liked it.  Very cucumber-y (which kind of made it taste (i assume) and smell like Nair).  Once my taste buds adjusted to the cuc, i enjoyed it thoroughly.  I will certainly be back.  I left feeling satisfied and full of energy, and that's what food is all about right!  There were tons of entre options that seemed delicious, I had trouble deciding.  FYI, google maps and yelp BOTH steered me near the restaurant but dumped me off in the surrounding neighborhood.  Easy to find, just follow the old fashioned indicators that you're close by - street name, number, and sign."}
{"text":"This is the first raw food restaurant I've ever been to and I really enjoyed it. I got their enchiladas and it was surprisingly savory. I also like that they serve fresh juice. It is a bit more expensive, but all the food is 100% organic, and it is prepared on the spot. The young ladies working there are also very nice and eager to offer suggestions if you aren't sure what to order. I will be back."}
{"text":"Food is fine, I recently ordered an apple pie. They gave me a choice of apple cobbler or apple pineapple. I chose the former. They confirmed the order twice. They told me they would contact me when it was done, likely within 36 hours. 5 days later, they called. I picked the pie up, paid the $60 dollars. I opened the box when i got home and called them. The girl on the other line explained to me she did not know that they gave me the apple pineapple until I had left. I asked why the manager who was standing next to her, did not say anything to me. She had no answer but assured me should would call me. She did not. I returned the pie. I told them if they needed the $60 dollars that badly, they could keep it. I have never been that angry, never!. They knowingly sold me the WRONG special order pie. They did not have the courtesy to either call or apologize. I have been a regular for ten years. I shall never set foot in this store again. If that is the way they treat regulars, I can not imagine what they would do to a newbie."}
{"text":"Rawfullorganicalydeliciousgoodness!  mmmmm, blue burrito or pizza w/ fresh juices.   Just GO raw and you will find going to be effortless! :P"}
{"text":"It pains me to say this but I'm now 0 for 2 with this place.  First off, I got super rude service today, the person with me was even appalled.  Secondly I paid $11 for an acai bowl. When I got it as a smoothie instead they told me it had no bananas on top because it was to-go so they just blend everything.  So I paid $11 for a small smoothie and crap service.  Cool.  I'm boycotting this place. I hope Vegas opens more places with healthy food and acai because this sucks."}
{"text":"I live in New York City now, and have tried every raw food place in Manhattan, and NOTHING, not even Pure Food and Wine compares to the exquisite tastes and dishes of Go Raw Cafe. Everything is pleasing even to those who aren't regular raw foodies.  I'm really addicted to the Purple Burritos- so much so that I used to make them at home! Not as good, but inspiring. Purple cabbage and Raw Heaven.   All the smoothies are rich and full of flavour. Wheatgrass is fresh and potent Every time. Don't miss out on the pizzas or the Pate. Pricey but SO worth it. Your energy levels will rise and your body will thank you.  My favorite chocolate they sell is the Raw Omega White Chocolate- This is Indulgence.  (You can find it other places but I choose to support independent chains)  Plenty of Reading Material and other Raw, vegan, organic grocery items for sale.   My mouth is salivating already- too bad I'm across the country!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. All the 3 entrees we got tasted like oversalted mush. I've eaten at many veggie restaurants, I expected far more creativity with spices. If the raw lifestyle means uncooked, barely seasoned food, I guess this is your place. You're better off with the  Veggie Delight  on Wynn road or Long life veggie on Sandhill, right off Flamingo."}
{"text":"If this place had been in Vegas 20 years ago I might not have given it up being a vegan.  If you like raw vegan food, this restaurant will not disappoint.  The food is fresh and good.  It has that wonderful clean smell of a vegan restaurant that serves green juices.  The atmosphere was very laid back, relaxed and casual.  It's a small, casual place with a homey feel.  The waitress had a calm, gentle demeanor.  She was very helpful without being intrusive.  She didn't breathe down our necks, or interrupt our meal.  The food was served promptly.    I had the vegi coti and the #2 juice, and took the gimme the beat burger home to my husband.    My friend had a salad and a smoothie.  We finished with delectable carob pie.  I thought it would be good but it was much better than I expected.  The food was not  salty, over processed, frozen and heated, or greasy.  The flavor came from authentic fresh ingredients.  It's my new favorite place to eat out.  One tip I can offer to first time diners if you aren't accustomed to raw vegan food - don't compare it to what your normally eat.  Don't expect the pizza to tasted like a typical pizza.  They don't use the same ingredients or prepare things in the same way.  Vegan restaurants go by a different set of standards and should be judged by those standards.  Update:  Loved it so much I went back yesterday, this time with my family.  My husband ordered the purple burrito, my son ordered the American pizza and I ordered the beet burger.  We each ordered a different delicious smoothie with our meals.  I told my son in advance - \"Don't expect it to taste like what you are used to.\"  We all tasted from each others plates.  We all loved all three plates, although my son didn't like the crust of the pizza.  It's raw vegan flatbread, and even though my husband and I loved it because it has a wonderful nutty flavor that compliments  the fresh toppings, my son prefers a  traditional pizza crust..  Unless you already appreciate raw vegan food, you might  want to order items that don't have a crust.  Before we left we picked up a cookbook so that we can attempt some raw vegan meals at home.  We can't wait to return to Go Raw Cafe!"}
{"text":"Amazing that a wholesome place like this exists in Las Vegas.  Good atmosphere, clean facility, and freshly prepared food, right by the lake. I'm happy to know this place has survived."}
{"text":"I go here every once in a while on a Sunday when I work an extra day in Henderson.. usually just picking up a Kookies and Kream, or a Veggie Wrap to go. Those are my go-to items other than the Body Cleanser Juice (so yum!). The food is always fresh and smells/ looks wonderful. But I felt I should write this review after my visit yesterday. I ordered the House Salad. Yea, you can get a salad anywhere... but this salad was AMAZING. And the woman behind the counter promised me \"The Best Dressing Ever\" - well, she didn't lie. The dressing was fabulous too!   My only 'eh' about this place is re: a man that works there who WAS nice at first but then got a little crabby with me and said something like \"you better not be lying to me\" when I mentioned that I never knew about the juice card and that I didn't get a punch on the card/ a card at all the last couple times I had gone in. HE gave me an extra stamp on the card willingly. I didn't ask him to. I wasn't at all rude when I mentioned that I never knew about the card previously. So it was a little off putting that he made that comment... over a juice card stamp of all things."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This was my first raw food restaurant. I don't typically avoid meat.  Price: At $15 per person for lunch, it was overpriced. (3/5)  Taste: I didn't expect much here and this met my expectations. It was pretty bland. (2/5)  Service: The service was ok until the lady behind the counter laughed at someone in another group for ordering a diet soda (\"lol no, we don't have soda here\"). Laughing at someone who doesn't hold the same food superstitions you do and doesn't know better is bad form. (0/5)  Atmosphere: The condition of the restaurant was a bit weathered. It was no worse than a typical organic grocery store (3/5)  Overall: Overpriced, condescending, and bland - I can't recommend it."}
{"text":"I love the food here, especially the Mexicali Combination. I'm not a health food nut, although I am coming around to avoiding all the damn chemicals and preservatives that the food and pharm industries like us to consume.  It is not cheap to eat organic or raw, so the food here is not inexpensive. But every once in a while my body says, \"Dude,\" (I call my friends Dude often so I think my body is trying to mimick me here) \"Dude,\" it says, \"I need something in that raw, yummy goodness so please direct the car to the Raw Food Cafe.\" I find that when I oblige, I feel much better, especially the next day or two. If I don't, it's okay, as long as I don't mind paying the price for resisting my body's request for the fuel it is asking for."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. Bf and I were in heaven. When you walk in you see a salad bar and a juice menu on the wall, but do not be fooled. The have an EXPANSIVE food menu. Bf thought all they had was a salad bar but I was like ohhh no... I had seen tons of photos of the food on yelp. Perhaps they could post the food menu on the wall next to the juices to make that clearer. The food here is beyond amazing. I HIGHLY recommend the Italian sampler with the lasagna, spaghetti, and the most amazing almond pesto crackers in the world. Seriously that almond pesto that they put on the crackers is making my mouth water right now. It was so so so good!"}
{"text":"You have got to love this place. It's the only cafe thats truly raw and organic on the eastside. They also have another location on the westside by the lakes. I buy all my supplements here and super foods such as the most amazing goji berries and other Go Raw products.   The green zing is my favorite juice and I usually ask that they take out the apples for my personal preference.   If you love smoothies get the superfood smoothie in a bowl with granola. To die for. I would get it every time I went.  They soak their nuts (for optimal digestion) so it's truly made with care. Such a treat. Oh and if your really looking to indulge I recommend the cookies and cream which is coconut and cacao blended. Yumm.   In regards to the raw wraps my favorite is the portobello mushroom wrap. Spot on.   If your looking to elevate your health and gain energy, Go Raw is the way to go and you can learn so much from this place. They also have a huge book collection including recipe books, books focused on certain ailments and other cool topics. I probably bought most of the books from there.   Good luck on your health journey and I hope you love this place as much as I do !!!"}
{"text":"We drove out to the westside location yesterday.  Bit of a drive to get there from the strip (20 mins).  We ordered the pate platter with hummus and spicy mex pate, with carrots and zucchini chips.  We licked the plate dry.  The sprouts that were the garnish were amazing also.  My wife got the mediterrenean salad.  Tasted really good!  I got the Gimme the Beet \"Cheese\" Burger with fries.  The burger was really well done.  The addition of beets was a surprising success!  The avocado fries were a bit interesting.  I liked it.  My wife thought it had a weird texture.  We each got a veggie juice and again it was great!! (could you tell that we were hungry??? :))  Definitely a recommended place to go in vegas if you're vegan.  Nice view of the lake next door also.  Food came out quick, I had read reviews that it took forever.   Only problem is that I probably won't be able to return on our trip :("}
{"text":"Very tasty, very raw, very vegan food. Pretty much the only place like it in Vegas. They do a good job."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, this used to be my favorite cafe but within the last year or so the service and quality has rapidly declined.  I'm normally not one to complain but the consistent rudeness and shortness of the staff at this location is not congruent with the vegetarian/yogi vibe one expects from such an establishment.    The food on the salad bar is constantly wilted and when I asked for fresh lettuce on my last visit, I was told it was too late in the day and they weren't putting out anymore food for anyone.  Every time we sit and eat dinner, the employees are rushing to close up, practically forcing customers out at the end.  I've also gone there a half hour before closing and they've put all the salad bar away and pulled in the outside seating.  In short, this is not a place I enjoy eating at anymore which is a shame because it's one of the few organic, veggie spots in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"You won't find a more hippie place than this.  As you walk in you can smell the fresh aroma of green organic goodness and the cacophonous sound from the VitaMix tells you it's as raw and homemade as you can get here, all prepared with love and good intentions.  I'm not a raw foodist nor do I plan to be; I just love to eat healthy as much as possible.   I've been coming here for more than 5 years now.  I have a stamp card for smoothies.  If you're used to jamba juice or any other popular smoothie places then you'll be pleasantly surprised by the freshness and thickness of their smoothie.  It's not as big but you get more bang for the buck because they use fresh fruits, berries and nuts.  No ice or watered down fruit juice as filler here.  My favorite is the Pina Cool-ada.  HEAVEN!    Now for their food.  For starter the house salad is the best salad i've ever had anywhere bar none!  The ginger infused nama shoyu dressing is amazing!  I've tried to replicate this at home many times but couldn't come close.  Whenever i finish all the salad, i would lick the plate (if no one is looking).  It's that good!  The lime-cilantro dressing is also good.    The Mediterranean wrap is delish.  The full wrap is very filling.  You could order a half wrap and a smoothie.    The \"burger\" is full of flavor.  It probably has around 50 ingredients.  To make this yourself at home would cost quite a bit.  This is not something I would attempt.  I have tried to copy the smoothie and salad and that's it.    If you're not sure what to order, just get the different sampler plate.  It has small portions of some of the popular items like pasta, mexi wrap, enchiladas, lasagna and zucchini pasta.    Writing this review is making me hungry.  I think I'll stop by after work today."}
{"text":"Great juices! Decent bar with pretty much all you need. The lettuce wraps are tasty, but.... The carrot avocado soup I didn't like & it's very expensive. From Brooklyn to Beverly Hills I think this was the most expensive vegan restaurant and that turned me off. I bout a small juice and apple pie desert snack, $13. Lettuce wrap,same juice,and soup was pretty much $18. I hate to complain on price given this healthy option is needed in Vegas,but it stops me from being a regular. Lots of spices & protein bars,juices and snacks as well. Not too friendly staff,but respectable"}
{"text":"Saw they had an acai bowl on the menu, but it was just a $10 smoothie with granola and slivers of banana on top. Bad place for acai bowl. San Diego must have spoiled me. I was able to go anywhere and pick up an organic acai bowl for less than $10 and they were huge."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Great atmosphere. Had the Vegi wrap and Blue burrito - both delicious, multi textured, flavorful and filling. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"If you want to go to \"Go Raw Cafe\" make sure you go to the other location what makes me unhappy here is  1. I asked for a shot of wheatgrass and the person who took my order went to cut the glass and put it in the juicer without first putting on a glove. gross!!!!  2.I asked to pay first 3 times , two times she didn't respond and the last time she asked me to wait until the other girl is done preparing but she didn't even communicate that to the other girl. so I had to wait until I finished the meal.  3. people working here not very helpful or friendly  4. no salad bar like the other location  5. I am not a vegan so I didn't know that the carrot soup is cold soup. and there's no mentioning of cold soup in the menu.  I really didn't like it!"}
{"text":"I am not vegan but I like this place. I am one of those people who has to eat meat or fish with every meal. I am on a special diet where I need to eat lots of veggie and fish. I was going to come here to get some good salads and then go to the  Japanese restaurant for some sashimi. there's salad bar and menu items. the super food smoothing is really good and loaded with antioxidant to keep my skin look great! at the end, I am full and satisfied so I didn't go to Japanese restaurant after."}
{"text":"This place was such a great find. My husband and I are vegetarian and don't eat a lot of raw food. But it was incredibly filing and flavorful. We had the hummus plate and the mexi sampler platter. It was so good. And the staff was incredibly friendly. Definitely checking this place out again when we are in town."}
{"text":"Got the Piña colada smoothie, it was super delicious!!! Also got the zucchini pesto noodle pasta, I wouldn't get it again, it was good but I wasn't really a fan of the pesto that they used. I will definitely be back for another smoothie though!"}
{"text":"Okay. Today is the day... I am submitting my very first 1 star Yelp review. Please forgive me.  So, I must first state that I am not a vegetarian or vegan, but I am an open minded person ESPECIALLY when it comes to food. I frequently visit vegetarian/vegan-friendly restaurants--My favorite being VeggieGrill in LA. Today, my vegetarian friend and I decide to make a trip to Go Raw Cafe because 1. My friend is a vegetarian and we typically cater to his preference when dining and 2. It is Ash Wednesday when Catholics observe by not consuming meat.   We arrive at Go Raw Cafe pretty excited being that it was our first time. We even mention this to the woman behind the counter who didn't receive our enthusiasm as we thought. She simply tells us to take a seat at the tables and she'd be there shortly. To her, \"shortly\"  meant ten minutes.  We politely asked the waitress what she would recommend. We went with a few of her recommendations and ordered the Mexicali Pizza, the Neat Loaf and \"Fries,\" and a Tropical Smoothie. We were also served two glasses of water with about one ice cube in each glass. We asked for more ice which never came.   So... our food arrived. As soon as it was placed in front of us, we were somewhat satisfied. Presentation was pretty decent. The Mexicali Pizza looked very well put together, the Neat Loaf and \"Fries\" looked \"interesting\" and the smoothie was well, not worth the couple cents shy of $7.00. It was about the size of a small in most places.   Onto the taste. The Mexicali Pizza tasted how it looked--decent. The buckwheat crust was just not what I imagined it to be. It was about the consistency of what you would imagine biting into a dog biscuit would be like. The toppings tasted very similar to a 7 layer dip which wasn't bad. The Neat Loaf was in my opinion, disgusting. We knew the second we took our fork to it, it wasn't going to be a great experience. The consistency was like that of poop. Kind of looked like it too to be honest. The \"fries\" were what I believe to be breaded avocados. I have never wanted to endulge in the greasy goodness of REAL fries ever in my life until after biting into those things.    I honestly try to make the best of every moment, and my friend and I were willing to order something else off the menu. When they waitress came, my friend had told her the Neat Loaf was not what it imagined it to be and asked about another item on the menu. I'm sure she took this as an insult, and she disregarded his question about the other item and asked \"do you want to box it up?\" My friend replied, \"Um, no, I don't think we're going to eat it later.\" She then says, \"then give it to your parents.\" Puzzled, he says, \"Um. No.\" Turned off and no longer interested in ordering something else, my friend reminds her of the ice she never brought us and she comes back with it ten minutes later.   After all that, I asked for the check, paid the $40.00 tab (in which I did leave a tip that my friend said I shouldn't have based on our poor service), and we left in search of something to eat. We wished we had just gone to Yardhouse for their Gardein items.    I do not plan to return to Go Raw Cafe... Or maybe I shall call it \"NO Raw Cafe.\"  Note: It is obvious that Go Raw Cafe caters mainly to their \"regulars.\" Sitting there for the time that we did, it was clear that we were not treated like their \"regular\" patrons were and not only felt ignored, but felt unwelcomed. First impressions often are lasting impressions."}
{"text":"I was visiting from California and decided to try this restaurant along with my sister and parents.  The place has a nice vibe, is clean and cheerfully decorated.  I perused their selection of supplements and also the raw foods available for purchase to take home while waiting for our order to come up.  (They also have a fairly large selection of books but I did not have a chance to look at those.)  The food was pretty good and it did come out quickly but the service left a lot to be desired.  There was neither silverware nor napkins at any of the tables--not a big deal but our server did not bring any out for us even once we were seated although she did bring us glasses of water with lemon slices.    We decided to order the flax crackers with guacamole and salsa and share it as an appetizer.  The food arrived pretty soon after with some brightly colored melamine plates but--still no napkins or silverware, which was a bummer since of course chips 'n' salsa can be a bit messy.  The chips were crispy and had a good flavor and the salsa and guac were obviously fresh and brightly colored.  The guac had a good consistency with little bits of veggies in it and the salsa was chunky.  (We could have used a few more chips though.)  My father ordered a small salad and the cooked item of the day--a curried soup.  Mom ordered a portabello wrap, sis had the purple burrito with mex pate and I decided to try the mock salmon cakes.  Everything looked great and was beautifully presented on colorful dishes.  Our waitress did eventually bring us napkins and silver but she just plopped down four settings at the side of the table rather than handing them to us.  She never did take away our menus after we'd ordered so I finally moved them to an adjacent table.  I don't think she ever checked back with us to make sure our food was OK but she did eventually come back to refill our water glasses.  (The place was not busy, either--I think there was just one other customer there at the same time that we were.)   I have to say I was disappointed with the \"salmon\"--perhaps I should have gone with my other choice which was the \"neat loaf.\"  The rest of my family seemed to enjoy their food well enough though.   We had a somewhat tight schedule so I'd inquired early on if their desserts could be ordered \"to go.\"  Our waitress said that they could; she said she would find out what the day's selections were and let us know what they had.  She said she thought they had \"pies\" but she never did get back to us on that.  At the end of our meal I got up myself , went to the kitchen and inquired about desserts which, as it turned out, did NOT include any pies.  They had several flavors of individually packaged cheesecakes, some commercial chocolate bars, and something billed as \"fudge\" that looked mostly like chunks of chocolate-tinged granola.  We decided to take three cheesecakes and some \"fudge\" to go.  As soon as we'd gotten up from the table our waitress came out to clear the table and as we were on our way out the door she thanked us for coming.  The cheesecakes were quite tasty.  The \"fudge\" was not bad but I really think it should be called something else--it really is nothing like fudge.  It has nuts, seeds, honey, and some cocoa in it but not particularly fudgey.  Overall I would probably go there again to try some of the other items on the menu but I am interested in raw foods to begin with.  I don't know if my family liked the place well enough to want to go back.  The Go Raw Cafe gets points from me for the wide variety of menu selections, pleasing food presentation, and the speed in which we were served.  Subtract points for our waitress not doing basic things such as bringing us silver right away, not taking up our menus, and not checking back with us once we were eating."}
{"text":"After passing Go Raw Cafe for a few months while going to visit my friend (he lives very close by), we both decided to go check it out before seeing a film. I'm a vegetarian and my friend is health conscious, so we were both very excited.  The decor is laid back and comfortable. There are many tables as well as bookshelves with health, vegetarian and New Age books for sale. I didn't feel awkward wearing my Rob Zombie Dawn of the Con shirt and jeans, which may not have flown in a more posh location.  I ordered the \"sushi\" and my friend had some flax crackers and dip. Both were delicious and very fresh! It took a while to get the food, but considering that they make everything fresh that was to be expected.  I also had one of their desserts, a vegan brownie that I picked out from the refrigerator near the register. It was a bit dry, but very good overall!  Next time I go I will definitely try one of their many smoothies."}
{"text":"disclaimer to start: I have been to quite a few raw/live restaurants. (wooohoo!) And DEF a ton of vegan ones. As that is my lifestyle. Not to mention the fact that as a part of my business, people pay me to create healthy recipes. Not only for people personally, but cookbooks, blogs, etc...including raw.   I have  even taught people how they can prepare delicious raw & vegan food at home in a class format.  On that note: We were excited to check this place out and taste another fun take on raw amazingness.  And sadly, from the moment the cashier opened her mouth the tone was set, it seemed. She was flippant & rude... especially when we asked to get almond \"cheese\" on 1 side of the \"pizza\".  The man and I both wanted to try and I am not a fan of nut cheeses. (or fake cheeses in general... or fake meat. For me... it freaks me out that something is not being what it truly is. I could prob say that's how I feel about fake people too! haha!)  That brings me perfectly into my biggest point...  Technically \"raw\" is anything under 119 degrees... SO, you could potentially  have warmed items that still maintain the delicious nutrients that all raw food offers. AND--- our fav places in LA do this.  For example... the biscuits and gravy do not come out ice cold. Same as their pizza.   The pizza was ice cold. And apparently every thing they serve is that temp. Or room temp. That really turned me off. I really don't know any time I would say... ohhh, I am totally craving a cold enchilada. I spoke with what seemed to be the owner to ask a few questions and of course... he was offended and will prob reply to this post. But alas... I am hoping it causes him to re-evaluate the temp? the service? As I know it is probably super easy to not have any worry regarding temperature.  The Buckwheat bread it came on was great! BUT--- we could've driven to whole foods and bought the same bread ourselves and assembled our cold dish at home. (especially with the price point so high)  The menu also said it came with \"walnut sausage\". Throwing small pieces of walnut on a cold piece of bread does not a sausage make. Another one of our fav places at home has an incredible walnut sausage... that is a delectable mix and packed with flavor... not just the walnut.  Which brings me to ANOTHER item on the menu they call \"fries\".... we were like... cool! Let's see the fun spin on \"fries\" done raw. Come to find out these are merely avocado slices. Just. Avocado. I LOVE avocado. If you say it's avocado. But don't tell me it's fries.  SO---  in a nutshell--- the flavors were actually quite good.  BUT--- I could buy at the store and assemble at home. (was hoping they built more ingredients in house, especially with the price)  Don't tell me things are NOT what they actually are. \"walnut sausage pizza\" is not cold store-bought bread with nuts on top. Fries are NOT avocado. And please make a disclaimer somewhere.... ANY where on the menu that says all of our food is served cold or at room temperature. (I know its a RAW place... but I know RAW... and it doesn't have to always be cold or room temp.)  then, we would know what to expect and probably really truly enjoy our experience.   Also--- a little kindness and maybe a crack of a smile goes a real long way."}
{"text":"When it's time to eat healthy, I turn to Go Raw!! With no microwaves, stoves, or ovens, it's gotta be good for ya, right!?  I submerge myself with granola guys and gals, and certainly don't tell anyone I'm a Republican!    Their juices and smoothies etc are great!  For lunch I've tried the traditional pizza and the international sampler...I like the sampler more, but both were great.  It's pricy but you are getting the freshest, finest ingredients you can put in your tum tum, so why not!  Friendly service and healthy food can never do you wrong!"}
{"text":"Dynamite!  I love it when I can just feel, see, and of course TASTE the pride of ownership in a restaurant.   After a long day of driving, my wife and I stopped into Go Raw for dinner and each had a cup of soup, plus shared a wrap.   The portions are very generous on the wraps, so sharing one was plenty for us.  I had the one cooked soup on the menu which was a vegetable puree. It was so flavorful and fresh tasting.   My wife had the raw, made to order, carrot soup, and I could actually feel my body thanking me as I swallowed a spoonful.  What I liked most was how pleasant the owner was in explaining his menu, and also how knowledgable he was about the Raw/Vegan lifestyle when answering our questions.   Will definitely return."}
{"text":"The go to place for eat all you salad bar and juices. We came here for the juices and wheat grass shots. They also sell vitamins and other nutrients you can add on to your smoothies and juices."}
{"text":"Review is just for the juices. Came here for my daily dose of green juice and this place didn't disappoint. Freshly made just pick on the menu combo they have on the wall. Try their wheatgrass shots for $3!! or you can have the blood transfusion (with a side of fresh coconut water) Try this place for your juice cravings."}
{"text":"Really good raw vegan food that is thoughtfully prepared, with creative combinations that made it tough to decide what to order. Came in with several others so I could check out their dishes too! I had the enchiladas which I really enjoyed - definitely a different experience than the usual enchilada, delicious in a way that is different than cooked vegetarian enchiladas. The zucchini \"pasta\" was also really delicious - so good that I will try to imitate this one at home...   I found the \"full\" portion of enchiladas and pasta to be pretty big - I was able to finish the enchiladas (stuffing myself) but I probably could have only eaten half the pasta dish. But I don't usually eat huge meals, so if you are used to eating big meals, you may want to spend a little more on appetizers and stuff. I'm too lazy to prepare raw foods like this at home, so I never expect it to be cheap in a restaurant.  Nice relaxing view of ducks on the lake, overall just a pleasant lunch spot. While I'm a vegetarian and pretty adventurous about trying new vegetarian dishes, my lunch companions are not - it surprised me that they were the ones lobbying to go to a raw vegan restaurant, but now I see why!"}
{"text":"wonderful vegan raw foods! every item is amazeballz De-lish"}
{"text":"We got the acai bowl, gimme greens juice, chips+salsa, mexicali sampler, and house salad with garlic vinaigrette.  BY FAR. The BEST salad I've EVER tasted. If I have one regret it's not getting a recipe for that dressing.  Beware of huge portions, the acai bowl and chips+salsa could've been meals individually so I could barely dip into my sampler platter, which was incredible."}
{"text":"I had Go Raw on my to do list for  years but never got around to it until recently.   Let me start with the good the female  working the counter was very friendly and welcoming after I told her it was my first visit. She suggested juice ( Green Zing- granny smith apples, lemon, ginger) based off my bitter/tart palate I described to her.   I ordered the green zing and the gimme the beet 'cheese\" burger with a house salad.   The juice was made rather quickly.  I was really looking forward to it. Tasted like motor oil and was \"luke cold\" pretty disappointing start to my first experience but no biggie.   The beet burger came out and I really enjoy veggie burgers especially house made.  The \"living bread\"  it came on had the thickness and consistency of beef jerky but tasted like tree bark. The beet burger itself was only slight less disgusting.  I  came into raw very hungry so for me to say it was terrible is mostly shocking to myself.   The house salad was the best part as it was mixed greens kale and a flax seed oil garlic dressing that was just OK and that's rounding up a bit. The salad was by far the best part of  and otherwise awful meal.  I ate the entire  meals as I was hungry. After eating I was literately turned off by the thought of more food even if I went  next door to get a slice of pizza.   They do not refrigerate or cool  or heat items to keep with the \"raw\" theme. That didn't seem like a big deal to me but only added to the awful tasting tree bark flavored meal I just ate. I like the concept of \"raw\" and natural yet they put to go items in plastic bags, plastic cups that are not made of corn or anything sustainable or green.  They have bottled juices and vitamins in a refrigerator as you walk in but then everything tastes \"luke cold\" as if nothing is refrigerated that you order.  I wouldn't wish Go Raw on my worst enemy. If anyone wants a free  get juiced card with a stamp on it, it's all yours.   Skip it  and thank  me for saving your taste buds later."}
{"text":"Thank you with all my heart Go Raw for my Californian grown raw GREEK olives to put into my GREEK bowl from Protein House that already has black olives in the bowl- as the claim them to be Greek. SO NOT GREEK!  NOW, I will add GREEK olives and make mouth gasms with this amazing bowl taste!  Service at Go Raw is always lovely such a blessing is this.  ELIZABETH at the register is a beautiful soul and Rod, so passionate about Raw eating and living- just beautiful."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a raw food lunch or dinner. Buy your vegan groceries here and many good resource books on the raw food lifestyle."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Aunt and I split sampler platter.too much food for us. Hummus incredible.  Service was so good.  Will go again and again"}
{"text":"I'm still working my way through the menu and have several favorites so far.  One fav is the collard wrap, it's stuffed with tons of veggies including mushrooms, which I love!  One of these is plenty of food for two people.  All the toast options are super yummy, flavorful.  Smoothies, Juices, and coconut (right out of the coconut) have all been pleasers.  The spaghetti is zucchini strips with yummy sauce.  I like the array of books and products they sell.  Healthy reset options for everyone."}
{"text":"This is probably the only decent raw food restaurant in Vegas, with that being said they still deliver consistent, high quality, fresh raw food.  Sometimes you have to wait but that way you know its being prepared right there and then.  I love the salad bar, but it comes out nearer to early lunch time.  My favorites are the Acai bowl, the number 28 smoothie, the cilantro dressing and the coffee desert. Go Raw also has many raw food books  and supplements available for purchase.  I'm glad they stay open until 9:00 pm because I don't get off of work until 8:00.  The vibe is casual and relaxed, and don't be in a hurry at all."}
{"text":"Thick carpet of BLUE MOLD on the food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I ate here once and loved it. The second time I ordered to-go. I ate as soon as I got home. Entree was soggy and the desert was covered in MOLD. And not a little mold. Like a week's worth of mold. I called to complain and they were very unconcerned. I don't think they believed me and I was not about to drive 30 mins back there to show them. I have pictures, but they didn't want them. So, I'm posting them all over the internet. Click on the 'photos' link on this listing and see for yourself.  And, yes, I called the health department."}
{"text":"A great mom and pop place to eat healthy & to grab a juice! Green Zing is my go to The have a pretty good selection of organic extras to incorporate into your life as well."}
{"text":"This place has the biggest selection of raw vegan food. Their juices are wonderful as well, all very well juiced. The atmosphere couldn't be better!"}
{"text":"I'm not fully Vegan or Vegetarian, I still eat meat around once a week but I'm slowly getting there! I was looking for a new place to try that would help boost my studying so I was looking for someplace that had a lot of fresh and healthy options and I came across Go Raw Cafe on Yelp! Located on Windmill and Eastern in the shopping center with the Smith's located right next to Tups.  Walking in, on the right you see a ton of books and supplements about raw eating, vegan eating, etc., on the ceiling were a bunch of hanging plants and near the back there's a salad bar. There was only 2 tables sat with 2 people at each table when we went and there was no one at the counter. Since it was the first time I'd been there, I didn't know whether to just sit down or go to the counter so I went to the counter since I saw a handful of paper menus. I grabbed one and started looking through it, I wanted to walk to the salad bar to see what they offered but I didn't since I felt a bit awkward not really knowing how to order so I eyed the Salmon Roll: Mock salmon, mustard, alfalfa sprouts, tomato, avocado, enoki mushrooms, yam \"rice\", garlic, & ginger as something I wanted to try but there was no one at the counter so I started looking around. Finally one of the ladies sitting at a table talking to a guy gets up and goes to stand behind the counter and just stares at me. No hi, nothing! Not even a smile! So I said \"Uh I'll try the Salmon Roll\" and she says \"Sold out\" Okay uhmmmm...\"the Veggie Roll?\" and she replies \"No, out of Seaweed\" Dang okay...then I start looking at the menu again and I hear her let out a heavy breathe. Wow! How Rude! Then I saw the \"Salmon\" Cakes w/ \"Fries\" & Veggies $15: \"tartar sauce\" accompanied by garlic flat \"bread\", House Veggies, & your choice of avocado \"fries\", or jicama \"fries\". and my boyfriend orders the Blood Transfusion $8.50: 2 oz. Wheatgrass & Coconut Water. She rings it up, we pay and then she walks back to sit with the guy she was talking to so we sat down. My boyfriend told me he was planning to get something to eat also but didn't want to deal with the rude lady. By that time we kind of already lost our appetite. Trying the food, the veggies were very good, nice and fresh and I also liked the avocado fries. I never received the garlic flatbread and as for the Mock Salmon, it was extremely sour and kind of smelled a bit rank. I finished the veggies and avocado but left most of the mock salmon. My boyfriend's drink was really good but I mean it really was just coconut water and wheatgrass, you can't really mess that up.  Overall, I would want to come back to try different items on their menu but the really bad service just kind of turned me away from this place for a while."}
{"text":"The view of the \"Lake\" was a nice treat. it was my first time at  a Raw food establishment. The waitress was very helpful with my questions and gave me some helpful hints on what to order. The kale salad and tropical smoothie were very filling and refreshing."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! We are always trying something new! My favorites were the beet burger, the samplers, and avocado fries! So good! They have a chipotle ketchup that is to die for and their Italian sampler... It's amazing. They have a great raw hummus and pâté. Their smoothies are delicious. They use a lot of banana, but you wouldn't know it. I always ask for half the amount when I order the superfood. It's delicious. The cookies and cream is great too! They have fresh juices that are wonderful and great little desserts. They are the \"Raw Makery\" and you can find their pre packed power house lunches in whole foods in the fridge by the salads. They have a small little section where they sell their snacks. They sell books and do raw cooking classes one Sunday a month, (I believe). They sell different vitamins and supplements and their employees are all pretty knowledgable on the subject of raw veganism. The ambience is very comfortable. You can study or meet friends or even go on a casual date. Whenever I am in the area, I always make a pit stop. Kinda makes me want a smoothie... Hm..."}
{"text":"When my body is craving healthy food, Go Raw is my jams. I have tried several items on the menu, my absolute go to dish is of course the Go Raw salad. The full size can feed 3 people, it's huge. My go to juice is similar to what I make at home, the Cal-C Yumm! I took 1 star off because of service, it could be better, they could be more friendly but I can't really complain. They deliver the minimum of what is expected. Happy body, happy mind. (*?*)"}
{"text":"Dear Go Raw,  Did we ever thank you for delivering our food to the Red Rock Hotel and saving us from God-awful hotel food? ((our co-workers were envious))  Did we ever thank you for picking us up from our hotel and taking us to your restaurant so that we could enjoy your raw food goodness?   Did we tell you that you have the most amazing food in all of Las Vegas?   See you next time, ok?"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. I would probably give it a 4 if I was a huge fan of raw food. They do a good job with the raw food preparation, but at the end of the day I prefer a heartier meal. The reason I do go back is if I want a light breakfast. Their toast with coconut butter and mango jelly accompanied by their Caro-Bana smoothie is perfect. Also, I go in for the smoothie when I want a light dinner. It has a unique taste with a hint of carob and tahini. Perfect sweetness with the dates."}
{"text":"This is one of the only few vegan restaurants in Vegas, so automatically I am a fan of this healthy establishment overlooking a man made lake with nice houses & boats. If you plan on visiting, order by phone and pick-up for an outdoor picnic, there's seating outside. Bring some breadcrumbs or seeds for geese and ducks by the water so they can get a treat too.  The place is pricy, but the food is healthy, tasty and nicely prepared. I got mock salmon sushi and portobello mushroom wrap and I enjoyed both but got hungry soon after (I'll blame the workout I had earlier) Next time, I want to explore their little shop a bit more and get the hazelnut mousse. It's a nice little restaurant and gathering spot for vegan and health conscious people.  -Yana  For more vegan reviews, pictures and recipes, visit http://www.littlemissvegan.com"}
{"text":"Mock salmon plate....all raw and made w organic veggies. This is an amazing treat to the body temple and taste buds. My first time here...the service is very good for one lone cashie in a place that seems to get fairly busy.  I LOVE eating creatively raw foods. But am skeptical about most places. This one is clean  well maintained, and good. They also have a salad bar w warm soups and other veggie organic choices.  Finally, get the sweet greens from the fresh juices menu....it too was pretty refreshing. Drive over to this spot and roll the dice on your good health in between rolling dice at the casinos....you will win over here everytime!"}
{"text":"My burger was very good! It greatly satisfied my tummy!!! My husband really liked his mexi sampler!! Will def make this place a regular stop when we are in town! We are not vegan nor raw lifers on a regular basis but this really hit the spot!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the raw/vegan restaurant in Las Vegas! Agree with other yelpers finding a place like this in vegas is hard. This is definitely out of the way from the strip, but worth the drive. The food is good, not great, but if you are looking for vegan food in Vegas and cant find it anywhere else, this is a good place to come. A little on the expensive side and staff is a little rude depending on who you end up with.   My non-V friend came here and she was satisfied with her meal. She really liked the smoothie we ordered. When in vegas, i would come back here for some V food, although there is not many other options, but it is a good one."}
{"text":"Being that I'm not a vegan or a vegetarian... I have many things that I can eat in this world. So, coming to a place like this is rare for me because I so often crave dairy, meat or fried stuff.  But I was mightly impressed by their Mexi wrap. I'd go back there immediately for another one of those. The almond butter toast with fruit stuff though... was... well, \"healthy\" tasting. :)"}
{"text":"LOVE love love finding new live raw food restaurants!!"}
{"text":"This place was alright. Good selection of books and the juice we tried was tasty (something with coconut water/flesh, beets, carrots, and ginger) plus the staff was nice. But when we came on a Saturday they were out of wheat grass and out of raw pies. Kind of a bummer. We tried a couple of packaged cookies (not made in house) that were good.  The main drawback is that this place is expensive. Raw food always is, but this felt a little excessive for Vegas (more like NYC prices)."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here and had to try it.. The food was amazing things I didn't expect.. The guy was very helpful in helping find something I would like. Best part to me is the variety of books u can read and even purchase while u wait for your food and eat"}
{"text":"i love this place..i really do.. mostly b/c its the only raw joint in vegas..and b/c this place started a new health quest for me that has changed my life.. the owners are a couple...Lou the lady is ususally at the LV location on sahara..her other half..not such a vibrant dude works the gv spot. They serve fresh juices, smoothies, amazing raw entres at reasonable prices. They serve duiran shakes..kefir beverages and have the most insane salads and raw pizzas around...not for the garlic shy... They have a bookstore and small area for raw food snacks and high quality oils, berries and health treatments.. they have healers and massage therapists working on tip basis some weekends..lectures and raw food demo classes..throughout the month the gv location has a soup and salad bar..the sahara loc. does not.. I wish the owners lived more in abundance..the vibe is not as vibrant as it should be..if it were my spot..i would have open mic..a place for artists to come.. and make the energy there safe..inviting..and empowering.. none the less.. tell them annie bear sent you..order the kefir margarita and buy the superfood snack products!! warning..if you are planning a large take out..make sure you call ahead of time..like..5 days ahead of time..they drive fresh produce in and are not prepared for large unexpected orders.."}
{"text":"Im trying this new place too see if it compares to daily kitchen or greens & proteins. Well I have to say for a true vegan its paradise. But for a person who just want to eat a bit healthy its just too much."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST raw food in all of Las Vegas. I've taken plenty of meat eaters here and so far every last person has enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"Unless you like over priced, expensive cardboard tasting food, stay away. It was very expensive for such mediocre food. I got the avocado toast on cardboard which was so overpriced. The owner was so rude and couldn't care less. I hated it so I wouldn't recommend it. Save your money."}
{"text":"So this is the year I decided I was going to be a vegetarian for the year. My quest started while I was still living in Manhattan so there was no shortage of great vegetarian and vegan places to try. Fast forward to me moving back to Vegas. Sheesh....no wonder everybody is a little chunkier here!  I wanted really badly to love the Go Raw Cafe. It's close to home, it's on my way home from the gym and I've been digging trying different foods. Hell even the reviews on Yelp seemed good.  My wife and I popped in today for lunch. I had the \"Gimme the beet cheeseburger and fries and she had a small salad she served herself from the salad bar. The place overall is very plain and casual. Looks like a small market with a couple tables to sit and eat. Nothing special or noteworthy. My \"burger\" was ok and definitely different. My wife said the salad bar ingredients seemed fresh. The part that makes this place hard to visit again is those 2 items with no beverages came to $22! Now I'm all for paying a little extra for good ingredients and ambiance. I really don't think this place is worth the cost. The one employee I had contact with was very solemn and automatic. I saw they had iced mochas on the menu for $7.88 and smoothies were about the same. Really? You thought Starbucks was rough! No amount of \"hip\" or \"fresh\" or \"healthy\" is going to convince me that I should pay you close to $10 after tax and tip for a coffee. It's really a shame because places like this need to exist and grow but with this economy and those prices and inconvenience (no drive thru or late hours), I hardly doubt they will. Take 40% off those prices and put a smile on your face when a new customer walks in the door....then we will talk."}
{"text":"My wife and I were new to the vegan world. We decided to stop eating meat and anything from it after finding out the insane amount of suffering the animals go through in the farms. After becoming vegans we were noticing amazing changes in both our health! I then started to research how to get the  maximum health benefits from being vegan.   Coming to Go Raw Cafe was our first step to supreme healthy eating. Everything was delicious and fresh! Desert was amazing! We felt strange eating cheese cake that was good for us. The atmosphere was relaxing."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible.    When I think of raw food, I think salads.  I think hummus, tabbouleh, with raw, fresh veggies, or gazpacho... Things like that.  This place however, was unlike anything I have ever seen.  If I see it again, I'll know to give up, get up, and go to Taco Bell.    The only dish, ordered by the entire party of 6, that was remotely appetizing was the raw, shredded zucchini with cold marinara sauce.  Their version of sprouted bread was an abomination.  And trust me, don't order the mock meat loaf patty thingy.  You'd be better off ordering a refrigerated cow pie.    Way too expensive.  The waitress was aloof and inattentive."}
{"text":"The best! Salmon Sushi, traditional Pizza, so delicious and the presentation was outstanding. 1st time here and I definitely found my favorite vegan cafe in Henderson."}
{"text":"This place to me was alright. The food LOOK so amazing & tasty, but when it comes to tasting it was alright FOR ME. I'm not a vegan/vegetarian, maybe that's why it wasn't the best to me. Their curry crackers almost made me puke. They tasted like dog treats and looked like dog treats. I ordered a sampler that had different varieties of food. Some of them had herbs, and after eating it a while it made me feel weird. My body is probably not used to it. Who knows! The place is pricy, and the outlook is decent. I love how they have books. I'm a book person. AND OH! Their customer sucks. The lady is just rude. You could tell she hates her job."}
{"text":"Only been here once and I had the salad bar and a smoothie.  The \"Kookies and Cream\" smoothie was really, really, really, good.  Salad bar was really good, fresh and they charge you by weight - good to know that ahead of time.   I would like to go there again to try some of their entrees.  From what i saw, the plates were huge and nicely presented.  The service was nothing spectacular but I wasn't really expecting it to be fantastic."}
{"text":"I hate to write this review. Really I do. But this place made me consider never eating vegan again. I'm astonished at all the wonderful reviews. I walked in and the woman behind the counter might have grunted a greeting or maybe she just glared at me. The place looks like all the skanky vegetarian places that were in Santa Cruz, CA when vegetarians were always skanky hippies with questionable hygiene. I thought vegetarians had come a long ways from then. Vegan food can be exciting and palette pleasing. It doesn't have to be depressing. It didn't smell good in Go Raw. I'm not sure if I'd say it smelled bad, but it just reminded me of the yucky hippy places of my college days. I did the \"salad bar\" for $9/lb. I took small helpings of most everything. The cilantro salad dressing was like an acid bath on my tongue. *shiver* Thankfully I hadn't put much on. But it  was like Go Raw VINEGAR! I had some stews that didn't seem raw...and they were warm. They were okay. Nothing exceptional. Some yam dish. Some other undescribable dishes too. I left feeling hungry and slightly grossed out. There was nothing in particular that grossed me out so I don't know why I felt so yucky. When I eat vegan food at a place like Native Foods in Costa Mesa, CA, I leave feeling like I've filled my body with awesome. But I left Go Raw feeling like I'd just filled my body with yuck. I wouldn't return. OTOH, it looks like most of you are loving it, so maybe it's just me. Meh."}
{"text":"This place wasn't for me. Had the mexiwrap, zucchini pasta and Acai bowl. The Mexican wrap was my favorite amongst the other dishes, however when I got home I started feeling sick and ended up throwing up. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian (have been for my entire life) and I never order salads (except papaya salads at Thai restaurants) unless I have no other choice.   I bought the Groupon for Go Raw literally 6 months ago and decided to finally go there today. My groupon expires tomorrow. I was dreading this visit primarily because I'm not at all a fan of raw vegetables for the most part.   I was pleasantly surprised. My husband and I entered the small cosy restaurant right next to the lake (sounds quaint and nice but the lake is actually pretty smelly) and we were surprised to see 4 tables (out of a total of about 7) with people. On a Tueday night. Vegas. Raw food place. Yes..I was intrigued. As we were having dinner, a few more tables got filled.  There was one waitress for the entire place. A very sweet young lady who was knowledgeable about the food and had some very good suggestions.   Our order:  1. We ordered the only cooked item in the store : their hot soup ($5.80 for a bowl). This was a simple blend of multiple vegetables in a thick stock with spices. We literally licked our bowls clean  2. Cheeseburger with \"fries\" (about $10.50) - the burger patty is made out of beets, various vegetables and grains and was presented in between 2 pieces of sprouted bread, tomatoes, onions, homemade ketchup/mustard and of course a generous helping of fresh avocado and almond \"cheese\". I was floored at how flavorful the burger was. It was one of the top 5 veggie burgers I've had in my life. When the ingredients are presented to you on a Yelp review, they do not look appetizing. In fact, the burger itself looked pretty bad. But the food is mighty mighty tasty. The burger came with their raw fries. I'm not sure what they were made of (I think avocado and some breading) but these were pretty bad. I'd skip this next time  3. The \"Manicotti.:\" I got the half order that was $8.88. If I were Chinese, this would be my lucky meal! I have to rave about the side \"pasta salad.\" This was made with slivered zuchinni/squash and various different veggetables and had such robust flavors of spices and garlic and marinara all over it. I didn't even miss not having spaghetti. This was just the best alternative to pasta I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. The Manicotti itself was also pretty good.   Our meal came up to just under 30 dollars.  I regret being so close-minded to not try this gem in Las Vegas nestled away in the Lakes area. To have the opportunity to eat clean, absolutely unprocessed food is hard to come by anywhere and although I don't believe I could follow this lifestyle (as unintrusive to nature as it may be) on a full-time basis, I think it does wonders to partake in a meal like this ever so often. I'm looking forward to my next meal here. I've already set a date on my 2011 calendar for this."}
{"text":"I kinda feel like giving this place 3 stars is a little much but I can't really give it one or two either (although my hubby says 2), it's kind of a toss up. I have never eaten here and the hubs and I are on a quest to eat at every healthy spot in  town to discover all the hidden gems. So I was super pumped thinking  I might be discovering a potential new favorite place.   The ambiance is organic, there are healthy books and naturals that you can pick up while your there, not a huge selection but they offer some. I noticed that they have a salad bar and it looked delicious and fresh, but because I can get a salad anywhere I wanted to hit that menu.   I went for the \"cheese burger w/fries\" and my hubby had the wrap; however we experienced a problem while we were paying. The lady at the register ran my husbands card twice and it generated a \"transaction failed\" so I used my card and it went through. My husband checked our account to ensure it didn't go through and it actually charged twice. We had to call the bank to verify it did . We told the lady that the machine actually did charge my husbands card, and she began to argue but not so much in an argumentative tone but with a \"that's not possible because the receipt says failed'' tone. It was really hard to make her understand, I told her it says that but the bank says that it actually did go through. So we dealt with that which wasn't a great way to start our first visit but it was resolved and by the time we were done, I was kinda over it.    The \"burger\" was good, didn't lack flavor , but I feel like something was missing from it, that there could have been another component added to tie it together but at that point I wasn't sure what it was. My husband was a little upset that the collard green that was used for the wrap wasn't deveined, he ended up just peeling it off and eating just the insides. We both ordered a smoothie, which was good but not the best smoothie I've ever had and in fact I could make the same one at home, and better.  I may try this place again, but it didn't stand out that I am willing to make the trip from my house across town to eat here again. I walked away not remembering the food, it just didn't give me that food memory I always look for."}
{"text":"My husband and I are going vegan for a couple of weeks to try something new and hopefully rid our bodies of the aftereffects of 6 weeks of holiday gluttony, so for our first vegan lunch out, we tried Go Raw. It was my first experience with raw cuisine and it was good!  I felt a little awkward walking in since my husband was wearing a hoodie from the (amazing) Chicago drive-in Superdawg and I was wearing a wool coat and leather boots but hey, no one threw paint on us so everything was good. The seating procedure was a little confusing but you are supposed to seat yourself and wait for someone to show up. Ok. Service was mildly apathetic but competent.  The food, meanwhile, was delicious! I loved the carrot avocado soup and my Love juice- apple, beet and ginger, a sweet and refreshing deep pink treat. We ordered half sizes of the vegi-cotti and enchiladas. The enchilada came with yummy guacamole, fake \"refried beans\" and yam rice. It was tasty and topped with a pretty realistic sour \"cream\" and red sauce. My vegi-cotti was a huuuuuuge portion with a really flavorful, fresh sauce- a soft tortilla filled with almond cheese and veggies with a side of zucchini pasta. I could not finish my plate and left satisfied.  The prices are a bit steep but everything is pretty much prepared-to-order and the ingredients scream FRESH. I will definitely go back as we continue to explore vegan cuisine in Vegas. I want to try the burger and avocado fries next time!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and it's pretty good. The first time, I had the Mexicali sampler, and it had a good variety of things on it. My favorite thing was the enchiladas. This was the first time I ever tried a raw food restaurant and it was great. I brought my Dad when he came for a visit and we both ordered the Enchiladas. I definitely want to try something else next time, but those enchiladas are so awesome it's hard to not order them. I think it's a tad pricey for what you get, but the food is really awesome. I like the samplers because you get a good variety."}
{"text":"Great salad and I can tell the lady who works here is special. She has the zin"}
{"text":"I looked at the menu and was super excited to try the smoothies.  I ordered the Coconut Durian Shake but unfortunately, they didn't have any durian on hand.  I then changed my order to the Acai Rio Bowl and for $8.88, I expected more acai berries in it.  Nope, I mainly tasted banana and quite honestly, not worth the price.  Love the idea of Go Raw Cafe, Hate the price.    Hmm...haven't decided on whether or not I will return.  Maybe where there's a half off special..."}
{"text":"Just found out this place is down the street from my house and I'm so happy! I'm on a pure organic alkaline diet and sometimes I'm to lazy to cook and prepare food. It's hard to find places that are all organic and support the alkaline diet. Well now I found a place I can go to enjoy some good healthy organic food. It's a little pricey but you can't put a price on your health. I had the Italian burger it was amazing! I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing raw and vegan food. Go with an open mind and enjoy the freshness of the entrees, salads, and juices. Your body will thank you for treating it so well."}
{"text":"Got some take out here yesterday since Happy Cow told me that it was the closest vegan place to where we were running errands at. It's in a little shopping center like most places in Vegas & it was pretty easy to find.   I'm a vegetarian who is about 80-90% vegan when it comes to cooking at home but I have never had raw foods at a restaurant. By definition I didn't really know what a raw foods lifestyle was, I only had a generalized idea. After coming here I did some research & realized that it's that & some more. Long story short raw foods is about eating unrefined whole foods in their natural state for better health as heating food takes away from the nutritional value of fruits/veggies. Anyway I learned that it's not as crazy as society makes it out to be it's just about creating meals like any other but getting the full benefit from the plants.   As a first timer here I was a little confused when I walked in. There was a lady sitting at one of the tables, I didn't put two & two together that she worked there at first since when we came in she didn't greet us or anything. I looked at the wall which had a juice menu but not food, turns out they have paper menus by the cashier which I took home for future reference. The lady noticed we seemed confused so she helped us with that. She was nice, just a bit reserved, she explained some of the dishes to us & I appreciated that.   There are a lot of options for juice & food. They also have a salad bar. No pictures on the menus which is usually how I like to decide because I'm very visual & I can tell immediately what I'm going to like by looking at it. Being offered so many options is nice but having to read through them frustrates me a little. It is a plus that I could take the menu home though, at least in the future I can read comfortably & know what I want for the next time.   The half size is good if you're a small gal like me & can't put away too much. It's a decent sized meal & I was super full at the end of it. We ordered a half size of enchiladas & a half size of vegi-cotti since they were sold out of lasagna. Both were very good & not over bearing on flavor, just right. The enchiladas were so satisfying & I loved the guac & dips on the side. The veg-cotti was really good too, the only downfall was that it stunk super bad of what I think was garlic. Our car ride home was a little tough lol but stinky-ness aside it was yummy. Price is a bit high which I can expect when eating out but overall I see myself coming back since the food was great, especially the enchiladas. I would like to try other items in the future & perhaps even visit the other location by the Lakes. It also inspired me to attempt more raw meals at home as well. Thumbs up & will def be back.   Oh forgot to mention! - They sell some raw snacks, tons of vegan supplements, & cookbooks too which is nice."}

{"text":"The last time I tried an appetizer and entree here was a few years back, I remembered enjoying it, but it's too vague for me to write about. Perhaps I will get an entree one day and update my review then. I have just moved out to Vegas from California and finally reunited myself with this wonderful place. (Hooray!)  I got their Body Cleanser juice (beets, apples, and a couple other things)  the first time I returned. I was nervous about the flavor because I have never had anything like it, but it was absolute love at first sip. I don't know what the heck I was tasting, but it was goooood. Also, beets tend to dye things so beware of your clothing, enjoy your red \"kool-aid\" tongue, and have fun when you go to the bathroom. Heh. Also bought a raw apple cookie, and that wasn't bad. Raw cookies are VERY different from baked cookies, that's all I can say. Not bad, but will not get it again.  The second time, I returned to try the Kookies n Kream smoothie and a raw chocolate cheesecake. The way they make smoothies just blows my mind. I witnessed the juice chef chop open a fresh young coconut for the juice in my smoothie, and collect a bunch of other fresh ingredients that he skillfully threw together into the blender to make my delicious bev. All good stuff, no nonsense fillers such as sugary juices and ice. Because there was no ice or anything like that, my smoothie came out a bit warmer than I expected a smoothie to be. It was very thick though, and it filled me up surprisingly fast. But then again, I was also chowing down my cute little plastic bowl of raw chocolate cheesecake. That was very tasty as well, and it was even a bit sweet to me! Both items I tried were very good this time, and it left me full in a good way...if I were to eat a plate of nachos and a slice of cheesecake from Cheesecake factory, I would be full too...but it would be a \"stuck\" kind of full. Like my digestive system would be clogged up with a bunch of junk. After I finished up my meal here, I was stuffed, but I felt wide awake and walking didn't feel like a chore at all! :) This is healthy, guilt-free stuff people. And for that, I would gladly pay what they ask for.    Service is good, nothing over the top and impressive, but I am pretty easy-going about service. As long as they are not bitchy or slow, they're good in my book...and the staff is far from bitchy and slow. If your food is served a bit slower than you like, remember, they are making this stuff fresh! Not Jack in the Box \"we don't make it 'til you order it fresh\", this is \"I just climbed a tree to pick the coconut for your juice\" fresh!"}
{"text":"I love everything about raw cafes and we need to have more of them in town. These guys are in my neighborhood and they are lovely. Great menu and potions are pretty damn huge. Small shop inside with all sorts of amazing pricey goodies. Love the raw cookies. Great place, right on the Lakes. ;)"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I'm neither Vegan or Vegetarian but was meeting a pescatarian friend for lunch and we were looking for a culinary adventure.  We split a house salad with the house dressing and the Mexi-Sampler plate.  My friend also had some sort of smoothie that I think had beets in it.  I ordered water - I really wanted a Diet Coke but was afraid to ask for it, lol, so I settled for water.  The salad was possibly the best salad I have ever had!  It consisted of mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, avocadoes, sprouts (I usually hate sprouts), and walnuts.  I'm not sure what was in the dressing but it was delish.  The mexi-plate was also very good.  I think my friend said a couple things were a little spicy but she's a \"Gringa\" so take that with a grain of salt.  She also really enjoyed her smoothie/juice thing.  I left feeling full but not lethargic - I will attribute that to eating raw and wish I had the discipline to eat that way.  However, my family would revolt at the thought!  It's a little pricey but I'm willing to pay more for good, wholesome, healthy food.  Restaurant was clean and had an assortment of books and products for sale.  Good music on the radio too.  My only complaint was that the service was kind of slow/indifferent.  The girl at the counter seemed more interested in texting than in her job."}
{"text":"Best vegan restaurant in the USA seriously wow. The most delicious food with the combination of you feeling amazing afterwards.  I'm from LA and I just eat at go raw or the other raw vegan place in downtown vegas. But Go Raw is very special great selection as well.  The samplers are great very generous portions and made with love I bet;)  Thank you very much  See you soon"}
{"text":"Sweet fancy Moses, I love this place! The food is delish, the service is great, and its healthy. Perfect all the way around."}
{"text":"Came here a few times for lunch and enjoyed every meal that I ordered.  I love the fact that I can have a meal, in Vegas nonetheless, that I can order something to eat and not worry about feeling gross after I eat it.  Everything tastes fresh and postprandial somnolence is nowhere to be found after grubbin' on some their tasty foods.  I've only had the pizza and a shake and I have yet to try the organic food bar for lunch.  My only criticism is the price as it is expensive BUT you get what you pay for so I'd rather spend my money here than upping my LDL and Triglycerides at another Vegas fast food joint fo sho."}
{"text":"This place was sooo disappointing!!! I am highly confused on the rave reviews.  Just to let everyone know It takes a lot to get a bad review from me. I usually give places the benefit of the doubt. And I was SO hoping this place would be amazing.   But it sucked!  First off it is located in a beautiful location right on the lake. But as we were walking up we couldn't sit outside because there was garbage everywhere! And I mean everywhere the ground in front of the door, all over the 2 tables. Not a big deal because we could just sit inside but when we got in it was confusing. Is it a self serve cafe or restaurant? the decor is funky there are a few tables strewed around and to the side there is a mini store (just shelves).   I finally had to ask if we should seat ourselves to which our rude \"waitress\" if you call her that.. told us to pick a seat. After 15-20 min she came up and asked us what we would like to drink. By then we already knew what we wanted and started to order. She looked at us very strangely and walked away. I was under the impression thats how we ordered considering she ordered our drinks...  I ordered the Beet Burger..and my boyfriend ordered the loaf i think..  The food was eh'. Considering the price I expected a little more but it was fine. After we had finished..30 minutes later she finally came back and gave us our check. This was also confusing because there was a bar to order things and a mini cash register on the side. We were not sure if we were to pay there or to her. So i just assumed we pay up front. We waited for 15 minutes while the woman talked to another woman about some products.   This place has so much potential. Especially because there are not many raw/vegan restaurants here in Vegas.  Save yourself the time.."}
{"text":"Love this place  the beet burger is the best.  Nice relaxing place with amazing healthy food."}
{"text":"Such a way cool hippie spot! The food is so good, and displayed so nicely!"}
{"text":"I had extra time between appointments while driving around town and yelped for something close by.  It was a little hard to find tucked in the back of a small shopping complex in the lakes but the food was great!  My only regret was getting it to go because they had tables by a window looking out at the lake.  It's a funky little raw restaurant but there's one in CA I fell in love with and this one is every bit as good.  I'm going to go back an dine in."}
{"text":"First time in and was shocked at how creative the menu was.  I had the beet burger and mother had the Italian sampler platter.  The beet burger was hearty and filling with great taste. The portions are very large.  Prices are reasonable. Will be going back to try the pizza.  Yes pizza."}
{"text":"Food is good here... But my friend is allergic to walnuts specifically , and she ordered the \"salmon \" sushi off the menu, and it did not say walnuts , only almonds and all the other ingredients. The lady that works there did not do anything about it. And didn't even take it off the bill. Also I heard them taking badly about me in espanõl. Happy with the food but not there service."}
{"text":"Going raw is hard to do, but with the food that they make here makes it way easier!  The beet burger is one of my favorite things on the menu!  The juices are sweet and healthy!  And the soup is fantastic!  They have a different soup on special every week.  The last one was a curry coup and it blew my mind! There is a dining area along with a cute little store front.  You can eat outside and enjoy the lake!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Go Raw Cafe, BUT this particular location on Windmill I do not enjoy going to and that is because of the service. I do not like to mention names but this lady never makes me feel welcomed there.  I always feel I am bothering her by asking her a question about something or even if I do not ask a question and I am just ordering. The last two times I have been there it has been pretty bad and I swore to myself I will not go back for a few weeks. I like to eat at a place where the staff is happy I am there.   What I do love about this location is the salad bar.  They always have amazing stir fried veggies and brown rice.  I get a scoop every time!   Its pretty pricey here so expect to pay over $10 for anything you order."}
{"text":"Love stopping in here for a juice. Everything is fresh and organic and its ready pretty quick."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Las Vegas in forever!! See my post on Friday 2/15/13 at Midas getting ready for this trip.    ANYWAY, I thought about bringing out juicer since we juice twice daily.  I didn't bring it to Vegas cause I didn't want to look like some Hippy Vegan. That was a mistake.  My body was screaming for nutrition and my mind was looking for my juice crutch.  I started to panic, I was thinking \"Okay I can just get a jamba or something\" but then I went to my trusty Yelp account and started searching and found this wonderful place.  I immediately took my hungover ass to Valet and got my car and hit the road.  It was only 20mins from the Tropicana - which was awesome and clean!  I arrived to find EXACTLY what I was looking for.  Clean, fresh juice.  Not a sugary sweet fruit juice.  The prices are right. The juice was life saving and the food bar is divine. This place made me want to be the hippy vegan I was so afraid to be.  Thanks for taking care of me and wife in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"When I say \"god awful\" I'm not exaggerating.  Asked for a speciality smoothie and while they were making it, noticed it was extremely thick.  \"That's not a smoothie, that's a blended banana!!!!\"  I asked them if they could please add more almond milk and they responded by saying \"all our smoothies are thick\"  - they then proceeded to add regular water, not almond milk like I asked.  Didn't fix the problem.  Think EGGNOG with a cup of flower or corn starch mixed in.   Then they served me my \"large\" $10 smoothie, which in any other place would be considered a medium size... And it was still so thick, so chunky, it was like oatmeal.   it wasn't a drink, it was a puréed banana in a cup...  Not exactly refreshing  or even drinkable in 110degree weather, post work-out.  Almost got a brain aneurism trying to suck it through a straw.  \"Thanks for the spoon but it still tastes like crap!\"    Also got a lemon grass shot at $3/oz.  when I was done at this horrendous establishment that was also: dark, crowded and poorly spaced/displayed - I went immediately to the Smoothie King down the street so I could finally find something to quench my thirst.  And while I don't like chains.... I just needed something to drink, that was palatable... and quickly.... Wheatgrass was $3 for 2oz. Half the price!  Maybe Go Raw has some \"special\" type of holistic, organic, special, wheatgrass that has been carried into Vegas by a yogi, healer that protected said wheatgrass from the droves of vultures trying to horde it's green nutrients..  Or, maybe they were just charging twice the price for the same thing I could get down the street.  Did I mention how rude and Un-accommodating the staff was at Go Douche cafe?  Also, SLOW....  Not like \"we are busy, slow\" more like, \"we just don't care, slow.\"    So, if you want bad food at extremely high prices and served with poor attitude in an aesthetically unappealing place... This is your spot.   Note to owner: take a trip to LA, visit EarthBar on Santa Monica Blvd. and learn how to operate a business.  Just cause you're selling speciality food to a speciality audience doesn't give you the right to act like a bunch of fart smelling douches."}
{"text":"After ordering their \"hamburger\" I was asked if I knew what raw food was, and if I realized that I was not going to be receiving a hot, bloody pile of meat on a bun. Not in those words... but it felt like that.  I got the #12 to drink (Body Cleanser), to accompany my meal... and that was nice. Too expensive at $6 for the regular (small) size, but everything you'd expect from fresh vegetable juice.  The burger was great. Filling, and fresh. The \"fries\" on the side were slices of avocado (yes, please) dusted with some kind of magic raw fairy powder that made me forget all about their fried and very long distant cousin the french fry.  A bottle of water for the road and a wheat grass shot came to $25. I know it's raw. I know it's fresh, but that's still a little too pricey for what I had. The presentation of the food was surprisingly artful, but the slightly inflated prices would have been much easier to stomach if the gentleman behind the counter was a little more welcoming.  While not very impressive on the inside, the menu was interesting enough for a repeat visit, and the quality of the food was high."}
{"text":"Wow. Go Raw Cafe is AMAZING! Delicious, phenomenal, nutritious, 100% raw cuisine. The pasta is outrageously tasty! This restaurant is the best thing about Las Vegas. Yum!"}
{"text":"My fav place to get juices and they have yummy humus plates and the salads are so good too. They opened a new location on rainbow yea..."}
{"text":"Showed up for a meet up happy hour and that wasn't such a hit however Go Raw is a gem. Right off the lake with a beautiful view. The food looked phenomenal as I watched a couple of people eat during our conversation and they validated for me that it was as good as it looked.  The juices and smoothies are absolutely incredible and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Everything is very fresh on the salad bar. All the fruit is sweet and the Salas dressing is full of flavor. So far I tried the #26 smoothie and it's great . I'll be back tomorrow . They also sell vitamins, books ."}
{"text":"My wife, 5 year old son, and I were in Vegas for the weekend. I am recently vegan and was googling and yelping for some good vegan grub here. After seeing some really good ratings on Yelp, we headed out.   The place is a bit hard to find in the dark, no lighted signs and it's a little hard to tell if it's open. However, as soon as we walked in, I said, \"man, it smells good in here\" and my wife said, \"It smells so fresh\", which is a perfect description.   A waitress greeted us quickly and was very friendly and called us \"you guys\" several times in rapid succession, which is a little pet peeve of mine, but I must get used to it since it has become the norm. \"You guys take a menu, pick a table, and make your self at home\". We did.  Our very friendly and upbeat waitress offered us a suggestion to have the \"Cheese Burger and Fries\". That was a great suggestion. If you are a hardcore meat eater, it probably won't make you happy. The thing I love about raw vegan food, as I recently have discovered, is the way I feel after the meal...light and energetic.   Thumbs up, and if we are in Vegas again, we will definitely head out to Go Raw Café'!  By the way, it probably wouldn't take much for me to upgrade my rating. I think if the signage out front were more prominent and the place was a little easier to find, I would give it a 5 star."}
{"text":"I will start off by mentioning that I am practically a carnivore - I don't tend to eat a lot of vegetables and it is hard to imagine a meal without meat. However, I love the idea of trying to eat healthier foods and wanted to check this place out. I was blown away by how good it was!!  I ordered the veggie wrap, which had avocado, sprouts, cucumber, tomatoes, carrots, and a nut paste in a kale wrap. I have no idea what was in the nut paste (it seemed like it was mixed with a dressing), but it was delicious. Tip: order the half rather than the full! The full came with four huge wraps, and after a juice and the guacamole appetizer, even finishing two of them was a stretch. However, I took the rest home to my husband, who is even more of a meat-eater, and he couldn't believe how good it was either. The only downside is that it seems a bit expensive for vegetables - our meal was $53 for two people. But it was delicious enough to be worth it.  I wouldn't go back to this location, as it is all the way on the other side of town. But I would definitely give their Summerlin location a try!"}
{"text":"First I love raw food, so satisfying...this place did not disappoint. We got enchiladas and cheese burger. Thought both were good, especially enchiladas.  Presentation was nice too.   Enjoyed the casual atmosphere and intimate setting. Also enjoyed variety of supplement, books, and snacks around the room.   Banana smoothie was okay."}
{"text":"We were in town for a conference and to see petroglyphs and the Valley of Fire, and we vowed to stay far away from all casino food.  We found the excellent Go Raw Cafe with the help of Google and our rental car's navigation system (the aid of both was necessary).  The food was fantastic and unique - the place is a real gem.  It was late in the day and we were the only patrons, but we kept the staff busy by ordering a few items from the menu, savoring them, then ordering a few more, then more, then more....  All of the tastes were so clean, nuanced, and tantalizing that the meal became an 'experience' rather than just a means of sustenance.    The mock items don't taste much like their namesakes - which I consider to be a good thing (too frequently the effort of making faithful meat-taste-copies out of meatless items results in a dull, plastic-food taste).  At Go Raw Cafe the namesakes instead seem to function as gentle inspirations suggesting creative new ways to combine flavors.  We racked up a decent bill, deepened the exhaustion of the staff (they confided that many of the items on the menu require a lot of preparation work - which we guessed, because it sometimes took a while for what we ordered to arrive), and looked forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Hard to find the restaurant in the parking lot, it's tucked away in the back corner. This was my first experience with vegan food. I was impressed, the food had excellent flavor for being served cold, I heated mine up and it was better than expected. I ordered take out, which was very easy and my food was ready on time. The quality is outstanding for the price. If you are a vegetarian or vegan this place is a must try.  Note, there is a small section of the restaurant used as a vegan store, score!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness, nutritiousness, and and abundance of yummy goodness. My favorite item on the menu is the spicy veggie juice. Every time I get it I instantly feel better. I also really love the super smoothies with either the fruit or granola. Everything at Go Raw is delightful and fresh and organic. Try it. You will feel so much healthier!! Well, what are you waiting for??? GO!!!"}
{"text":"at least we have one place but, because we have one place that is a monopoly they slack.    the one guy with the dreadlocks is one angry vegan.  Maybe cause he's miserable and hasn't had a real hot meal in years...  dude is damn right lecherous staring down women's shirt.    anyways, the food is overpriced for not having an oven and a gas bill.  It's not bad in a pinch and but, suck the money out of you.  half the people that go in their are morbidly obese anyways.   I do go back for the mexicali wrap cause the price is pretty reasonable on that.  how do charge so much for vegetables?  and it's not even all organic!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time here and I have to say above anything the staff was SUPER friendly and answered all my questions, (and I had a lot of questions.)  I ordered the chips/salsa/guacamole to start and that was my favorite item tied with an iced mocha with brazil nut milk and agave.  I also had the \"hamburger\" which was really like a veggie sandwich which was OK but maybe not an item I would get again.  I ate half of it and decided to leave the half because I started doubting I would eat that other half later.  The \"fries\" it came with were avocado slices rolled in some nuts or spices.  My girlfriend tried one and we both were like, \"ok that's interesting.\"  I think it had curry or cumin in it so it was not a hit with me.  I also had a pre-packaged chocolate chip cheesecake which was surprisingly good.  I ordered so many different things because I had never had raw food except maybe once or twice from Whole Foods pre-packaged meals before and I wanted to try it all!  I also had the Kookies and Kream smoothie.  It was too banana-tasting for me but still good.  I wanted chunks of raw coconut in there so maybe they will accommodate me on that request next time.  I can't imagine the staff there saying \"no\" they were so freaking nice.  The shopping center this place is in is adorable too.  It reminds me of the shopping centers in Laguna Beach.  The café has beautiful views of the lake and it feels like you are floating in the lake in a way because of the way the property sits under the ground a bit.  This is a very casual place.  I will like it when I want to wear no makeup, feel like caca and need to put good things in my body.  I definitely feel full as f-ck right now but kinda feel good about it.  Probably my imagination but I feel like the foods were so nutrient dense that I met my daily intake of everything.  (Or that's because I ate everything.)"}
{"text":"I brought my dad here for lunch. I like the menu, and the restaurant is very cute. It's got a nice location by the lake. The food quality was ok, but I'd say it was far too overpriced for what it is.  I got a smoothie (super yummy), coconut water, and Mediterranean wraps (so so). My dad got granola and a coffee.  The total came out to just under $40. Kind of steep in my opinion.  There were two women working. They were very friendly, but not super attentive. They brought my smoothie first, then my dads food, then his coffee, then my water. It was very much in pieces, and we were finished with each individual item by the time the next came.  The last thing that came, the wraps, came almost 40 minutes after the first smoothie. I had to go up and ask for the check after we'd been left alone for half an hour passed finishing the food.  The woman were kind, they just weren't super ontop of waitressing portion of the job. All in all, it's an ok spot. Decent food if you don't mind the price tag. Worth trying out, but not somewhere I'd frequent or bring several people to."}
{"text":"I do not think I will be coming back soon.  The prices are WAY high and overpriced.  I also think when you order something unusual and you don't like it, you should be able to send it back.  There is a reason most natural food stores have this policy, so people can TRY things.  I understand this isn't a huge business like Whole Foods but prices are high to compensate for a disliked item being replaced.  To have a policy that if you were warned the taste is strong, you cant change your order but if you weren't warned you can is just bizarre.  The trash outside next to the lakeside tables is always overflowing.  A shame cause it would be a nice place to sit.  So disappointed.  I want to love or at least like this place. One redeeming quality is a very nice male cook who patiently answers questions about the food."}
{"text":"The fact this place got such great reviews made me want to check it out, but I wasnt fond of it. The service was probably the best thing about the place, second best thing was the Vanilla dream smoothie, it was really good. I had the enchiladas and they were gross."}
{"text":"Love this cafe!! Can't wait to go back, owner is very knowledgable, food is excellent, and lots of top quality supplements!"}
{"text":"I'm a meat-and-potatos guy.  But I've been to plenty of the vegan places that make the fake meat dishes. Looks just like Pork!   They can be fun.  But \"Go Raw Vegan Live food\"?  AND, you expect me to walk in and order \"The house salad\"?   Uh...  WOW this place is great!!  The best thing on the menu has the prosaic name \"house salad\"  Delish!! they should change the name to \"transcendent seventh heaven salad\" or something :)  The entrees can be a little hit-and-miss.  I loved the  (not)pasta with (not) marinara sauce.  But I couldn't  figure out the \"purple burrito\", some mushy stuff in  a thick purple vegetable skin -- meh.  I also haven't tried (yet) the wheat-grass-hemp- whathaveyou smoothies they are obviously big on.  Yes, the place on Windmill in Vegas IS just a store-front.  It doesn't even say \"Go Raw\" except  on a small sign at the door.  Just look for the  Vegetarian place in the SMITH'S supermarket parking lot.  Service?  Layout?  RELAX PEOPLE.  I've seen people walk in, sit at a table, and the \"waitress\" took their  orders just like at some steak house.  I've seen others  walk up to the counter, discus food with the staff, then  order/pay at the counter.  It's all good.  Relax. Breathe.  For me, this place gets FIVE STARS for making me believe I could actually/easily be a vegan -- with these people preparing my meals anyway.  Eating there just makes me happy."}
{"text":"I absolutely love RAW FOOD, especially when it is made for you. Everything I have had has been full of flavor and absolutely delicious. Their pricing is expensive, but you get what you pay for....no harmful chemicals and nasty bi-products. The staff is very friendly and willing to answer any question. So thankful it is close by!"}
{"text":"So I went here to meet up with a group, but it was a bad experience since most of the group flaked out on me. Anyway, when I got inside, I saw that the decor was very colorful and vibrant. It gave a hippie vibe and it seemed to be runned by hipsters (which I don't mind because I consider myself a hipster). I had one of the strongest juices they had on the menu with the most ingredients. I had the biggest cup...which could've been bigger, but eh it was a good drink anyway. I didn't eat anything so I will update my review once I try their food."}
{"text":"Lunch: Weekday  As part of my yearly Lent (Latin: Quadragesima - English: Fortieth) I like to give up meat for the 40 days of fasting. Las Vegas does not have many places that cater to the flexitarian or no-meat eaters. So it was some what difficult to find a place.  The place I went to was GO RAW CAFE. I was craving a beet juice due to all the  sun exposure from all the bike riding around Hoover Dam. I felt a tinging from perhaps the onset of a sun blister. Beet juice for sun blister is the way to go, since beetroot has lots of the amino acid, lysine.    The place is not the best, and not the worst. It had what I was looking for..raw juice. They were limited on the vegetables and fruits they carry. Guess I'm spoiled with the juice places found in Los Angeles (Pico-Union neighborhood), and Bedford Stuyvesant, Bushwick (Mr. Kiwis)  In addition, they sell books on juicing and other supplements."}
{"text":"The food was terrific! :) A- Chips & salsa were great! I had the veggi cotti, WONDERFUL!!  The \"pasta\" had the perfect amount of garlic, nice flavor! My man had the burger, DO NOT eat the \"catsup\" it seriously tasted heartburn acid. It was horrible & I never want that taste in my mouth again. The service was lacking & not great.  Management needs to step up!!! This place has soooo much potential, I feel sad seeing it in it's current state.  Beautiful view of the Lakes.  I will go back because the food was great, but we'll take it to go next time."}
{"text":"This was a rare find! I'm a gluten free vegan and it was great to be able to order anything I wanted on the menu! We actually ate here once on our trip to LasVegas and came back the next day to pick up a dessert to go. For our dinner, I had the Beet Burger and my  boyfriend had the Enchilada. We loved both of them! The avocado \"fries\" weren't really to my taste, but the burger more than made up for it!  For dessert the first time, I had the \"cheesecake\" I was a little disappointed because it was not made in the store, but prepackaged. It tasted fine, though. The second dessert we got the  next day to go, was \"fudge\". It was good, but the name is misleading. The \"fudge\" was made with oats and nuts. It was good, but not fudge like. Also, the staff was not sure if the oats were gluten free, or not .This place has the typical health food store atmosphere that I love and will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"A long time ago (okay not that long ago) I bought a Groupon for Go Raw. As typical for my procrastinating self, the Groupon was not used until the day it expired. I wish we hadn't waited so long, and I wish we would have gotten another Groupon.  This place is hidden away in a strip mall that is really not on any major road. It is nestled right off the \"lake\" and you can admire many a large house from the seats inside. We arrived at about 11am, and the place was pretty quiet. We were greeted right away by a very helpful and friendly young woman. She was really excited that it was our first time, and she offered us many suggestions. She also went over some of the differences in how raw food is made. The wife and I chuckled a bit as we don't look like your typical \"health food\" eaters, but on the inside we are both hippies, so we knew what to expect.   We went with the International Sampler and the Veggie Sushi plus the chocolate cheesecake for dessert. My first reaction to the sampler was how big it was. It is pricey for sure, but the I really expected the portions to be smaller after reading other Yelper reviews. Everything on the sampler was delicious. The hummus is the best I've ever had. I don't like runny hummus, and this is not. It has little chunks of chickpeas, has a nice strong garlic taste and the raw tahini flavor is nutty but not overpowering. I could have eaten a pound of the stuff. The Mexi-cali wraps were very flavorful and fresh. The guacamole was incredible. However, my favorite was the pasta. I don't like zucchini, but the pasta was so delicious. The sauce was beyond words. I wish I had bottles of the stuff. It was like a marinara salsa but was so full of flavor.   The veggie sushi was also delicious. It was jam packed with fresh veggies and some sort of flavorful paste. The seaweed was a bit chewy, but other than that it was very good. The ginger sauce was also very strong, but not overpowering.   The chocolate cheesecake was not made in house, but was good. It was a bit grainy, but tasted like cheese cake. It was very small, but was nice to split after having filled ourselves full at lunch.  This won't be a normal stop for us as its a bit out of the way and a bit pricey, but it was a very good filling healthy meal.   As other reviewers mentioned, they do have assorted food, supplements and books for purchase. Nothing seemed to out of the ordinary. There was also a lot of art on the walls."}
{"text":"My husband and I got a Groupon to try Go Raw Cafe.  It is very quaint and non fussy.  When we received our menus I asked the waitress if they had any Gluten fee options.  She was very knowledgable ( may have even been the owner) and told me that 99% of the menu was Gluten free!  I was so happy. She was then kind enough to list the items that were not.  We ordered the neat loaf, the chip and hummus platter and the  vanilla- date smoothies.  We did not care for the neat loaf, but LOVED the smoothies and the appetizer.  Their fresh salsa, guacamole, and hummus are perfect.    Next time we will try a wrap or the beet burger.    Sit by the window and you will get to watch the duckies.  :)"}
{"text":"Pretty hefty amount of money for a regular *small size*...I got something that is normally not on the menu cause when I picked up their order menu, it wasn't listed. I got something called jgb...I think lol. Has ginger and 2 other juices that are seriously masked since the ginger overtakes the entire drink. The customer service wasn't spectacular. I mentioned I'm new to the cafe *assuming she'd share what's popular or ask probing questions to derermine a good drink for me* and she looked at me and asked, \"Is that it?\" Normally, someone would get a good tongue lashing, but I'm working on not allowing people to get on my nerves as much lol."}
{"text":"Had the purple burrito. It had a lot of flavor and it was a lot of food. If you are looking for all natural food. This is the place."}
{"text":"Hidden in the back of a strip mall (of course, it's Vegas after all!) beside a man-made lake (again, Vegas) is Go Raw Cafe.  Staffed by nice hippies, they made us raw food that was so fucking delicious it was insane.  They're not afraid of intense flavour - even including raw garlic in dishes to spice them up.  This is a good thing.  They don't rely on nuts too heavily either, though the cashew ricotta is wonderful.  This place was a 5 minute drive from our off-strip convention headquarters, and I don't think I would have lived through the visit if it wasn't for Go Raw and the Whore Foods up the road from it.  All hail."}
{"text":"I have definitely had some good to go meals here, but we decided to dine in instead. First of, the vibe was very unwelcoming in here. The cashier was not personable by any means and did not care to ask what we may be looking for as we were deciding what we wanted (she just awkwardly stared at us). My boyfriend wanted the pasta, \"no pasta\" - ok no pasta, got it lady. Without thinking he orders the lasagna and again, \"no pasta\". It just felt very cold and not inviting whatsoever. We seemed to wait forever for our food and she didn't bother to give us our water cups. She just seemed like she was very inconvenienced to do her job and we were over it once we got the food. My Mediterranean wrap was okay (first time trying it), pretty bland. The traditional raw pizza was bomb, def would recommend that. All in all, we won't be back and will continue to harbor Go Vegan which is a similar place - much better service."}
{"text":"Disappointed!  Came here on a Sunday morning at opening time and no one was here to open up.  Really wanted to check out their food since there's not too many healthy options in the area ."}
{"text":"what a strange place this has become, walk in, no greeting, hugh sour puss on cashier, no smile, no hello. no nothing, except, a sad look ! we sit down. cashier looks away, i get up and get 2 menus by cashier, next to register. girl is so sad !  says nothing, doesn't ask if we want water, or anything to drink. we look at menue, ready to order, and the female worker walks in kitchen and starts washing dishes. another customer walks in. goes to register and waits for about 4-5 minutes, then walks out. worker still in kitchen, never checked on us, we wanted to order, gloomy worker stayed in kitchen as another customer walked in and waited 3-4 minutes and also left !  so we got up and left !  absolutely no customer service !  how are they still in business ! they must need a write off !  always bad service ! this time they just avoided all customers !  go elsewhere !!  it\"s  too bad !  this was noon time ! all zombie workers, all the time, unreal !  zombies & deaf mutes, they deter business. must be a tax write off ! OLD FOOD ! COLD GREETINGS ! Bad Fruitcake,Tasteless by Tommy B  LIER !"}
{"text":"I debated whether or not to write this review since it was my first raw food experience. I eat a variety of foods, and eat vegetarian meals about 4 days a week. So yes I still eat meat and, I'm healthy.  To tell me my body is a grave for the animals I eat is rude. I don't think he meant it that way and was polite but, it is still not what I want to hear the first time in your establishment.   Prices- Vegetables are expensive so 8-10 for a plate is still high by my standards for some lettuce and sprouts and a wrap.  Presentation of food- Presentation of food was nice and well done.  Taste- I did not care for the food at all  Atmosphere- Clean nothing exceptional a few books and grocery items along the wall.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Man, if you juice, this is the place for you!  I made a special stop on our way to Pasadena to get my Beet, Ginger, Apple juice.  I went 4 days without one since leaving Cincy.  I have been here several times, and each time was great.  They do have a frequent juice card you can get stamped, but I only come maybe, if I am lucky once a year.  If you are the raw, vegan, juicing type, stop in and pay them a visit.  You won't be disappointed, that's for sure!  If I ever more to Vegas, I will become a regular, you can BET on that! lol"}
{"text":"Despite the annoying company I had the day that I patronized this restaurant, the food here made my trip to Vegas worthwhile.   I had the pizza and the mocha shake. I don't know what it is... the ambiance or the food itself, but I felt a need to slow down and enjoy the food, the atmosphere, and my company. For a second the person sitting across from me was starting to look attractive again. With a happy belly and a calmer demeanor, we left the restaurant. Unfortunately, all the happy thoughts that were running through my head halted when my \"friend\" opened their mouth.   Good food does wonders. I'm not guaranteeing that you'll come to appreciate douchebags with Go Raw's food, but you'll definitely come to appreciate raw vegan food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice the food is pretty good the atmosphere could use a little work and the employes could use a smile."}
{"text":"The experience at go raw vegan was an amazing mix of wholesome and delicious!   They even have a walk-in pantry of amazing vegan foods and products that you can take home after your done eating  I  ordered the mexi cali pizza, meditareen wrap, and cookies and creme smoothie   All were vegan and were so good I forget to take a photo for help until your done eating.      Go here and eat if you want an increased quality of life  :D  Yay!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom!!!!!!!!!!  I've been here several times and can't believe I have never written a review on this place. It's tucked away in a corner of a strip mall, very odd location and kinda hard to get to, but once you find this gem, oooooo boy! I've been to their east location and I like the west one much better.   Great fresh everything. Definitely splurge and get a juice and an appetizer if you can. I want to try everything on this menu someday. In previous visits, I've had the Gimme the Beet Cheese Burger and it was great. The \"fries\" are literally wedges of avocado and the ketchup that is served with it is not so great. I have also tried the purple burrito and the lasagna, both good but not my favs. I've never tried their \"sushi\" but I will be back.  For this visit, my boyfriend and I decided to stop in for lunch. We've totally forgotten about this place and I am really glad we came in. We started with the Yummus Hummus - Hummus, sliced tomato, & hemp seeds, absolutely DELICIOUS!! So flavorful, great texture, can't really describe it. Just TRY IT!!! Not your average hummus, but better. Served with living bread (sort of a flax seed cracker) which I adore, and fresh slices of carrots and cucumbers. Mmmmm.   Next we got our juices, my boyfriend ordered a super juice \"Liver Mover\" (hahaha what a great name) Beet, Carrot, Cucumber, Coconut Water & Flesh. I tried it and it's very tasty, slight sweetness but not too much, probably sweet from the beet.  I ordered the #12 Body Cleanser - Carrot, Cucumber, Beet, Apple - mmm mmm mmm! Very refreshing and perfectly fresh. We were also served some water with lemon.   The boyfriend ordered a half order of the kale salad and it is enormous! So fresh. Organic kale tossed with red bell peppers, onions, cucumbers, & avocado. Served with buckwheat bread. You could smell how fresh it was when the waitress put it on the table. I got to try a bit and it was yummy.  I ordered a half Veggie Wrap - Pesto, \"almond cheese\", tomato, avocado, sprouts, onions, cucumbers, & carrots wrapped in collard greens. It was served with house slaw which was a very tasty chopped beet salad. AHHH-MAZING. I would hate to see what a full order was, I had plenty of food and it was oh so good. It is definitely the \"almond cheese\" that makes this so good. I love that stuff, it sort of reminds me of a chunky white cheese spread. I have ordered it on the side with flax crackers in the past and took it home to devour. It's really a good snack...trust me.   I don't know what the negative reviews were all about, I can't find a thing wrong with our experience today. The waitress was also super friendly. This is the first time I have had a waitress take my order at the table - I usually just order at the counter.   If you like interesting and healthy, clean food, definitely check this place out with an open mind. I really felt ... GOOD...after eating this food. Sure, the food is pricey, but where else are you going to get this quality and taste anywhere else in the Valley?   This place also sells raw and vegan books, and some interesting holistic things like himalayan salt lamps and crystals. It's a very casual, quiet place, with very neat paintings on the walls which are all painted by a local artist and are for sale.   Even if you aren't a vegetarian/vegan/raw food person (my boyfriend is definitely not) you will find something here. Give it a shot, it's good for you! I am including three pictures of our meal so you can see the amazing food for yourself. A+++"}
{"text":"I've been to the west location a lot and only been to the east location once. I don't really care for the layout in this location but the food is excellent. My friend is trying to get into eating healthier and had never been to Go Raw so I suggested going her to try something new.   We shared the International sampler and it was amazing. First of all, it is a LOT of food and it is quality ingredients. Everything was delicious. We were so full we had to waste some of the veggie \"pasta.\" It really resembled pasta too, yum. My favorite was the garlic living breadsticks and the hummus.   We also tried a shot each of the E3 Live juice. OK, it's a little strange to the palate, but I felt really REALLY good later. I must buy a bottle of this stuff! I think I saw it in an organic market frozen in cubes... they sell it by the bottle at Go Raw for $33 but I want to shop around.  The woman at the register was nice to us...a little reserved but I didn't get any rudeness from her at all.   Love the book selection as well...great variety of raw food and other health related books."}
{"text":"Delicious! I was in the mood for something light but still satisfying so I decided to give this place a try. I ordered the beet burger and although I didn't know exactly what I was eating (the \"fries\" I think were avocado slices covered in something, no clue) it was all very tasty. I definitely will be back to try the juice next time. Also for being raw it was very very filling."}
{"text":"First time at this place and it was AWESOME.  They have a tomato, pea & ginger stew which was AMAZING.  It was late, cold and rainy out, so this hit the spot.  We also had some fresh juices and a smoothie.  When on this side of town this place is a MUST."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a smoothie one morning, always happy with this place.  The owner and his staff are always friendly and willing to help if you have questions.    They have a great selection of raw foods which sometimes you have to acquire a taste for but overall the food is all good and healthy.  The smoothies are a nice change every once in a while especially since the are made to order and are always fresh.  If you are in the area of this location, stop in and try the food...the location on the other side in the Lakes has a little bigger food selection with soups and sorts, but both are awesome and worth a stop."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good!! I'm so thankful to have Go Raw near me-- they deliver right to my door!  Fresh organic healthy raw food is all I could ask for. I just wish they made me desserts!"}
{"text":"I like to come here when I feel like I have to detox.  Expect nothing but fresh, unprocessed food here.  It really is \"go raw\".  I don't often come here, but when I do, I get a juice and something off the food menu.  I tried the \"burger\" today and I have to say, it wasn't so bad.  I felt good eating it, not guilty.  The saying eat to live is very true here.  I can't recall what juice I had, but I know it was under the super juice menu.  Liver detox or something like that.  Any how, give it a try.  But just expect to spend a lot, it's pricey."}
{"text":"Good Food, Healthy choices. The prices were a little high for a small place like this but I guess you pay more for healthy food. I wish we had one closer to me in the South West Henderson is a little far from me. Also one of the workers was yelling in Spanish \"I'm going to hang you by your ears.\" to her son. It was kinda funny to me but to other people they might not like yelling. lol I'm assuming it was her son."}
{"text":"The Go Raw Cafe is located in The Lakes Right off of Lake Sahara Dr. It is a small strip mall right on the lake. They offer a raw vegan menu and they also have a small grocery section where you can buy packaged items.  The menu has a variety of different items all made from raw foods. I ordered the following items:  Beet Burger - Excellent! A burger made from beets and other veggies served between living bread with a side of avocado fries.  Avocado Fries - Excellent! Sliced avocado rolled in bread crumbs.  Italian Sampler -  Excellent! Veggie spaghetti, veggie lasagna, and lining bread with veggie cheese. It was all made from raw foods.  Vegan Sushi - Excellent! A veggie roll made with mock salmon.  Acai Berry Bowl - Good. Acai berries blended and topped with granola and banana slices.  Overall it was an interesting meal. Definitely a must try if you enjoy raw foods."}
{"text":"This place is a godsend. It's a nice break from The Strip and the chaos.  Treat your body right with some good food!  The Green Zing was very popular, but I opted for the Sweet Greens (I believe that is what it was called). Juice was refreshing and definitely hit the spot.   I decided to get the mexi-wrap as I heard so many good things about it. The pictures don't really do it justice and I was surprised at the size of the portion. The half portion was big and satisfying, especially eating it with my juice!  They have a salad bar that cost $8.88 lb. and offer other goodies.   ...Vegas, in the land of the 'all you can eat buffets', this place was refreshing and proves that quality is better than quantity."}
{"text":"4 stars may be generous, but I like supporting healthy restaurants. We've never felt so uncomfortable at a restaurant before. After I specifically pointed out my interest in the \"Kookies & Kreme\" smoothie because of the coconut and cacao nibs, the waitress agreed that those ingredients were delicious together & made no mention that the smoothie also included banana & several other ingredients. The menu says #20 smoothie with coconut & cacao nibs. So rather than writing out all the ingredients in that particular smoothie, if you don't notice that it says it is a \"#20\" WITH the coconut and cacao, you'll get a totally different smoothie.  The smoothie tasted like BANANA. You don't taste ANY \"cookies & creme\" flavor. AT ALL. It just tastes like a banana smoothie. Neither of us could taste anything but banana. When I said something, the waitress pointed out that it DID say the smoothie had banana in it. I was super bummed because I didn't want banana. The waitress seemed to take it really personally, even though we were very nice to her despite the confusion. Like it seemed she was really angry at us for the miscommunication. We weren't angry with her at all, so it was awkward how she seemed offended. She didn't charge us for the smoothie, which was nice of her.   We ate the enchiladas, which weren't BAD but weren't GREAT either. There was some dry stuff inside...it seemed like a recipe gone wrong. Enchiladas should have lots of yummy stuff inside, but instead it was just a thin layer of this dry nutty stuff. The sauce and toppings should have been on the inside. It wasn't as good as it could be.  I ended up ordering a coconut-durian smoothie (since I didn't want to the banana 'cookies and creme' smoothie), which I've ordered before and knew I would enjoy. It tastes mostly like durian, but durian is overpowering. I like it.  It is awkward when you walk in, because no one greets you. You have to walk up to where they make the food and let them know you need help.  I prefer this location to Go Raw's other location - it's by a man-made lake with a nice view of beautiful homes and has outdoor seating. There's a huge selection of raw vegan goodies.   I would go again, mainly because there aren't many raw vegan options in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was good but not good by LA or New York raw-vegan-food standards.   Pretty quick service. Good place to go for lunch or a snack.  Great selection of raw & vegan supplements, snacks, and books.  Really enjoyed my coconut-durian smoothie, although I'm aware most people can't stand durian =)  My rotti-something dish (can't recall the exact name) was good but not great. I would definitely like to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Last Tuesday was my first visit to this location (I usually frequent their Summerlin location) since it's not too far from my work. The setup is different and smaller, but I like that they have a salad bar here. There were also samples of their products that you can purchase to take home; I tried the chipotle kale chips and it was very yummy! Pretty pricey though, so that may be one thing that I'll have to make at home hehe. It was really slow that morning, which was perfect since the food is made to order and I was in a hurry. I ordered one of my favorites, the lasagna (layered with zucchini, carrots, spinach, marinara, and nut cheese). It was soo good!! Absolutely LOVE IT. A friend (not a Vegan!) tried some of the lasagna and he was sold! It's so wonderful to be able to access really fantastic live, raw, organic, Vegan eats in the valley!"}
{"text":"I am not vegan or vegetarian but do have friends who are so initially tried this restaurant with them.  I found the food to be so delicious I have been back on my own many times.  It is expensive, especially when one gets used to the cheap eats in Vegas but it is worth it for the quality.  So far I have only had their mexican sampler platter and the house salad with the cilantro dressing.  Even though I mean to try other items these have been so good I can't stop ordering them."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their smoothies. All are dairy free and made with fresh fruit. A little expensive but you get what you pay for. The protein smoothie is my favorite. I can't eat dairy so I've been craving a milkshake for a long time and this place does the trick."}
{"text":"Where did I Go Raw? A very Cleansing Visit. Hooray for fiber."}
{"text":"2 words: HIDDEN GEM!!!!! As a vegetarian I find it hard to eat in las Vegas' restaurants except... Here!!! The service is fast and very nice and the food.... The Mediterranean salad is just amazing!  Don't forget to grab a fresh juice!  Definitely a place to remember!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service anywhere around... If your going to change the price of an item, do it on the menu not a piece of paper you printed out and put next to the register. Also when a customer is telling you it would be better to change it don't shrug your shoulders and act like you could care less. Horrible customer service, and the patrons in there need to mind there own business when customers are talking to the employees about it. (MIND YOUR OWN FU@$ING BUSINESS)"}
{"text":"Great selection of raw, organic vegan cuisine. I eat here at least 3 times a week. The \" burger\" is my favorite. Veggie-cotti, mexi-wrap, and all the pizzas are tasty as well."}
{"text":"I love Go Raw Cafe!  There aren't very many raw restaurants in Las Vegas and this one just so happens to be located around the corner from my office.  From green juice to smoothies and the creamy carrot & avocado soup...the food is perfecto!  I frequently order the \"half\"(due to the hearty portion) kale salad and the coffee & cream raw cake...it's better than the original tiramisu.  Go now!"}
{"text":"The Go Raw house salad was delicious. Also had two veg juices, the #12 and the green zing. This was split amongst two of us. Both juices tasted great. I expected the large size to be larger but it wasn't too small. Glad to see a place like this doing well, offering a great selection, and tasting yum."}
{"text":"I FINALLY went back to Go Raw today, after literally 2 years of meaning to go...That is an insane amount of slacking.  And I'm pretty mad at myself, because my lunch was delicious!  I got the \"vegi-cotti,\" a large entree of a manicotti-like creation with raw tortilla-type shells filled with minced veggies (cauliflower, broccoli, zucchini) and creamy and luscious cashew \"ricotta\" flavored with pesto.  It also came with a veggie pasta primavera (strips of zucchini plus other chopped veg) in a perfectly seasoned tomato sauce.  I tried my friend's creamy tomato soup that she went crazy over (it was damn tasty) and her house salad.  Everything was crisp and fresh, and it just felt so good to eat like this!  We both paid about $20 for our food + Fiji water, not bad considering the quality.  I'd definitely be doing myself a service by taking $20 out of my weekly booze budget and eating lunch here on the regular.  I am probably an undersalter, and this food tasted great to me, but I could see how people used to restaurant salting might find it bland.  You'll find this little nugget of healthfulness tucked away in the Smith's shopping center.  It doesn't say \"Go Raw\" out front, so it can be a bit confusing.  Look for the giant \"veggie cafe\" and \"juices\" signs."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place randomly during a roadtrip. The food was tasty and unique. Fresh ingredients with a lot of taste and spices. The layout of the cafe was open and inviting. Plenty of seating for big groups.  Try the pasta!"}
{"text":"Food is definitely different, but it taste good. I can recommend the \"burger and fries\". It was nothing like I had before. The \"bread\" is some type of firmer thin crust. The \"meat\" is this beet they blended up to shreds. The burger had a ton of other yummy stuff in there too. The fries were an interesting turn. It was guacamole shaped in a string and covered in this red powder. The \"ketchup\" was really good, but I could not tell you what it was made from. Overall the presentation was really nice and artful.   They have a lot of other health groceries too, like books and supplements. Service was really nice and when I came there was live music, well a guy playing a flute. Wish I had cash on me to tip him. Next time I guess. Oh and they have some nice looking desserts."}
{"text":"Wow is all i can say.     I was expecting  to have to acquire a taste for raw food but this was truly tasty.   It makes sense  that  raw is the best for good health, I wanted to try it made by pros.   I had the manacotti and salmon (mock vegie) sushi to go.  Both dishes were flavorful and with wonderful texture, you dont miss meat or heat when the food is so yummy.    The cafe had a spicy, pleasant atmosphere and was quite crowded, i didnt know so many people were into raw food.  You can browse books about raw food too.   I will definately go back."}
{"text":"I used to live right down the road from here and one day i was craving a healthy meal so i decided tk check it out. Im a veghead but not a raw foodist, this was my first time visiting an all raw establishment. I got the beet cheeseburger with avacado fries.  The burger itself was honestly better than many cooked veggie burgers ive had! I did not care for the \"bun\" though...so i just ate the burger without it lol. The fries were not to my liking...plain avacado slices would be better lol they ruin them by covering them in breading but they arent cooked so its a weird soggy mess. Get salad instead!"}
{"text":"Soooo delicious and soo healthy! Addicting!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic raw vegan cafe!  A cute place on the little neighborhood  lake. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday of the week (they close early on Sundays so get there before 5). I love the carob smoothies with tahini and banana. Also, my personal favs are the Purple Burrito and the Neat Loaf and don't forget the berry loaded cheesecake.  Im not exactly sure how they do it but I know its vegan and its damn good.  They also have a little area of ingredients thats used in raw preparation along with cookbooks and supplements for sale.  They offer some food prep classes as well as other lectures. You know, you just feel good when you leave there and cant wait to try more. www.gorawcafe.com"}

{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Go Raw.  I like the heathy juices and the house salad is terrific.  I am very into eating organic and from time to time will have the will power to go raw vegan for a few months.  My love of all things gastronomic doesn't hold me there for long though.  Once I called in an order for a juice to go.  When I got there they said they had no idea who I spoke to but they don't take phone orders.  They asked the employees in the back if anyone had talked to me on the phone and taken my order and they just shook there heads. They suggested I had called a wrong number which made no sense.  Like a wrong number would take my juice order.  When I got back in my car I looked at my call log on my phone and sure enough it was their number I had called.    Another time I got something in my salad that wasn't susposed to be there.  It happens.   I forgive them but I am deducting stars accordingly.  It's just a little inconsistent at times."}
{"text":"Las Vegas, you have a treasure.  This place should be front and center. Get your asses in and try it!"}
{"text":"I love that Las Vegas has has a raw vegan cafe. Be warned though, some of their food is, really... Earthy. I had the burger and the patty was kind of odd and not really that great. Their guacamole is some of the best I've ever had. I like all of their books and extras they sell. Great resource for raw vegans or those just looking to improve their health or try new things."}
{"text":"I took some friends here for lunch today as a 'Thanks' because I had been their houseguest for the weekend. Also, they saved my company from having to pay for a hotel room for 2 nights, so it didn't cost me directly - which wound up being super nice because it cost $60+ for lunch for three peeps. Ouch.  Inside it looks more like a bookstore, with food added in as an afterthought. We ordered from a tired looking gentleman, who was quite sweet. We sat down with our drinks, which were apparently 'naturally effervescent,' and proceeded to explode all over our table. The only thing we had to try to control the fizz were some paper napkins, which didn't impress the staff too much. Sorry - but we had to protect our laps from bubbling mango soda!  We shared the chips and salsa - which was fine. The salsa was really good and fresh, but there was only about three tablespoons of it. And the flax chips were OK, just a little thick and soy tasting.  We then got the vegetable sushi, which was quite good. A large serving of a maki-like entree, except without rice or fish. It basically tasted like a delicious mouthful of vegetables that I wouldn't have tried without some outside encouragement. I mean, I never thought I would truly enjoy raw enoki mushrooms.  My friends got the portabella wrap and beet-cheese burger. The wrap was ok - very salty marinated mushrooms and 'almond cheese' wrapped in some raw chard. The burger was slightly better - tasting very much like nutmeat and also served with a generous helping of 'cheese.' The salad that came with the burger was large and really, really good.  We did add salt and pepper to everything, though. Generously.  All in all, I would recommend this place if you want to get out of the unhealthy eating-out lifestyle. The food is more of an experience than some omnivores might be up for, so keep that in mind when planning a night out.  And don't use more than one napkin!"}
{"text":"This was a nice find while searching for something early in the morning. The house salad, Mediterranean salad & avocado toast was good. The big problem was they advertised themselves as vegan but had honey & bee pollen in some of their stuff. So that's a bummer."}
{"text":"Very tasty raw food. I was happy to find this place. It's hard to eat healthy, raw foods or eat out vegan style. It is a little expensive but I would rather pay a little more for quality ingredients. Their salad bar is a fast and healthy way to get \"fast food\". I like their fresh made to order juices. I usually get the raw Italian sampler plate. Believe it or not but the raw spaghetti is very good."}
{"text":"Try the Bruchetta...it's addicting. The house salad half size is enough as its huge and the kale burritos are amazing. The veggie juice I think it's called a v8 is excellent and you can order it spicy. I wish they would redesign the dining with comfy seating. If they did it would be a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"I am not a vegan but i love this place. I love how the menu is fresh and healthy. I must say you must have ACQUIRED taste to enjoy this type of food,. I ordered a platter to sample a couple of items.. i wasnt use to the food but i would highly recommend this place to vegans and vegetarians. I also had their detox shake it is awesome! love it! would i go back here? YES OF COURSE! would go back for their fresh juice and their meals.. You might wanna try their organic bar they offer daily. I must warn you about pricing it is a bit pricey.. for a shake and my entree i ended up spending around $30+ i guess its the price you pay for being healthy but well worth it!"}
{"text":"The layout: Stupid, please, hire an interior decorator or something to help you rearrange your store/cafe. The fact that customers don't even know where to go to order their food or even find the cash register shows that the layout is flawed. It's too cluttered and everyone that walked into the place after us also seemed confused, unless they were a regular.   Also, don't have a \"bar section\" complete with stools and whatnot if you're just going to use the counter to dry off appliances. Gross.  The service: Lacking. The lady was nice enough, but she gave us no greeting when we came in, gave us no instruction on of we order/sit first or how to pay.  The food: The only decent thing about this place. I got the italian sampler. Lots of tomato, maybe too much, but the pasta was delicious as was the toast and lasagna.  The only thing I'd have to say about the lasagna is to lay off whatever herb they put on the tomatoes for that particular dish. It's too overpowering and really ruins the taste of the lasagna itself. Had to scrape it off to enjoy it.   Also bought some fudge, which was delicious and I really want to know how they make it. Didn't get to try any smoothies, but will probably back to give it a test.  The price: Alittle pricey, which was to be expected, as all vegan/organic food is usually on the high dollar side.   Final Note: Also, I heard someone complain that the food was cold. It's called Go Raw Cafe. Everything is raw. You're an idiot."}
{"text":"If you are into Raw food you will love it here. If you are not into Raw food you could go either way. I love the salads here and my favorite is the Kale Salad.  The last time I was there I had the \"enchilada's\" and I found them to be very tasty and fresh. I like the food here but it is pretty pricey. I love all of the Vegan and Raw books the store has and they have some nice products too. A very small little place in a strip mall but a great place to find some Raw choices which are few and hard between here in Las Vegas and Henderson."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing salad bar! I love how fresh and unique everything is. The smoothies and juices are good too! Friendly staff and also a nice place to sit inside or outside. I also purchased some body oil at the check out and it smells amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I was on my way to Chipotle when I remembered I was near Go Raw. I figured I'd do lunch here instead, I hadn't been in over a year. What a mistake. Never again.  I got a \"large\" juice and the enchiladas. When the juice came out in what appeared to be a 16 oz plastic cup, not even filled to the top, I figured I'd been given the small by mistake. No big deal.  I'd give the texture-less, bland enchiladas 1/10, the accompanying sides 8/10, and the juice a 3/10. Beet/apple/ginger, it was mostly apple juice.  There was a funky odor when I went in, I figured it was just something in the dehydrator. After I placed my odor, I realized it was the smell of urine coming from the homeless woman in the other corner. It got to the point where I was gagging on my food. I asked for a box and the check.  When I got the check and saw that I was charged for a \"large\" juice, I asked the server how many ounces in a small. She told me the small is 14 oz, and the large is 18 oz. I am certain I was given less than a pint of juice.   I forgot my juice and box of food there and I don't even care. I cried a little driving out of their parking lot. What a horrible experience."}
{"text":"I absolutely love eating here! The atmosphere is very earth-like, the staff is super friendly, the food is alive and delicious!  I enjoy their fresh juices. The Chlorophyll Cocktail is one of my favorites. I've tried all of their wraps, pizzas, sushi, and most of their salads, and must I say they are all \"rawesomely\" amazing. Everything taste so fresh and you definitely won't feel sluggish after eating. They also have a mini bookstore where you can read. As well as vitamins and various other health supplies. The location is quite hard to find at first. It's in a small area with random stores by it, and cute little ducks that are great company. An awesome place to try out.  It's pricey, but worth it for getting live, nutritious food!"}
{"text":"I am torn between a four and a five star review. I have eaten at Go Raw Cafe a couple of times. The first time with my folks, which kind of soured the experience for me since they were continually criticizing of everything (which they do in general regarding my being vegan). The food I had the first time I went was pretty good, though I got one of the veggie juice drinks and I just could not stomach it. As surprising as it is, my mom the ultra nag ended up drinking it!  Fast forward over a year. I just got back from Go Raw Cafe and I had the \"Cheese burger\". The burger was HUGE. It came on a well decorated plate with the burger on one \"bun\" and the toppings on the other. I started to eat the two separately but one of the ladies at the restaurant urged me to put the burger together, mash it all down, and go ahead and make a mess. Well, I did and I have to say the burger was amazing and very filling.  I will definitely be going back to sample more of their dishes. Who knows maybe I'll end up changing the review to five stars!"}
{"text":"I like this place. I had the raw/vegan beet burger with fries.  It was packed with flavor and the portion size was enough for two meals. I mistakenly thought the fries were going to be baked, but \"duh\", that's why they're called, \"Go Raw Cafe.\"   I appreciate that they have health conscious books and yummy raw/vegan goodies for sale. I will be back to try something else."}
{"text":"I love that this is so near to my business. Being from California I am right at home here with the raw food and by the water  It reminds me of being in Venice beach.  The staff is nice and always has a good suggestion and the food is pure fresh and great! I love love love the mexi wrap! Can't wait to try more things off the menu. My fav. #5 add Green Apple. I'm an avid juicer and vegan and thrilled to find it!"}
{"text":"by far my favorite Cafe in Vegas, iv been coming here for at least 7 years, about once a week if not more, my favorite items on the menu, the house salad & portabello mushroom wrap, w a full coconut, the servics is great, the food is fresh & healthy, the atomsphere is awesome.  nice to have a place to eat and not feel guilty because ur not eating process junk food. love this place!"}
{"text":"NOTE: I am a major carnivore. I hate veggies and health food makes me squeamish. Keep this in mind.  I found the food here.. well kind of gross. We got 2 sampler platters and honestly all the food tasted the same! I realize maybe my palette isn't \"refined\" enough to tell the difference between fake lasagna and fake enchiladas, but seriously the food was all so similar and boring. Props to the people who can stand to eat this stuff all the time.. it takes some ridiculous will power.  As someone with a degree in the biological sciences I think the concept of raw food is completely unfounded and ridiculous... but I have to appreciate that there are others that disagree with me despite the overwhelming lack of true scientific evidence in their favor. Our bodies create their own enzymes, there is nothing wrong with this. There isn't an advantage to eating enzymes, and plant enzymes don't help your body perform better or even aid in human digestion.  Ok anyways, not to start a heated vegan debate here, but I can say 2 facts about eating there. 1. The food is PRICEY. Seriously we're talking $8.88 for a smoothie.. WHAT? I guess \"quality\" is expensive, whatever. 2. I have felt sick for the 12 hours since eating this so called food. I know it takes awhile to get used to raw food, and the first time you feel ill or something, but I don't very much enjoy feeling ill after eating \"healthy\" food. I don't get it.   Advice to carnivores.. this place isn't for you (ok duh, that wasn't very helpful). If you're feeling adventurous like I was, good for you, but be warned that our stomachs aren't made to handle this \"living\" food and you might not be happy after eating there!"}
{"text":"What a find. Visiting a friend and was curious if we could a vegan restaurant in Las Vegas where we were staying. .... 2 tenths of a mile away. Amazing raw and cooked food... Plus juices and smoothies.  They have been there 12 years.... Outstanding food. Very thing made to order and NON GMO!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and I found it very tasty. I've been experimenting with eating more raw foods so, this place has been on my radar even more. I'm not sure that any person would love this cafe but if you're a vegetarian, or interested in having a healthy meal to accent your regular SAD (standard american diet), I think you would like this place.  I arrived early and noticed they only had very small (for my liking-15 ounces) bottled waters, I walked over to Smiths to buy a large water for a fraction of what they were selling theirs (didnt even check their prices). I had my own water canteen/bottle, so just filled that up and walked back to meet my friends for lunch.  We chatted at a table and perused the menu. I order the vegi-cotti. I chose this because it came with a side of their pasta primavera so, I could try two dishes at once. Both were yummy. I ate one vegi-cotti and half the portion of pasta primavera and took the other vegi-cotti and remaining past home. It was a very generous portion but it should be given the price of $13.88.  The PP was strips of zucchini, the shape of thicker linguine. The sauce was a very tasty tomatoey sauce. The vegi-cotti was their in house Italian veggie mixture (including basil and parsley) cut very small so it was easy to eat, as it was stuffed in one of their sprouted flat breads (kinda looks like a thick darker tortilla). My recommendation, eat the entire portion at the restaurant. The leftovers, while still tasty, the sprouted bread had a crunchier or firmer consistency when newly prepared. The left overs were a bit soggier but, still tasty.  My friends (have been to Go Raw before-this one and the Sahara location) shared the Mediterranean Pizza and the Enchiladas. They said both were very good.  Food is good and fresh. Prices are high. And, I think for these prices they should have some cold tap water in pitchers with lemons or cucumber."}
{"text":"Would have got that extra star if they had a salad bar like the other local. Love the avacodo fries. Not fried. Had almond cheese. Loved it. Very good selection of remedies and nutritional products. Highly recommend and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Honestly, I have no idea how these folks make raw food so good. I would just end up with a big plate of veggies. These people are trained artists with raw food. I'm not even vegan but if I could find a place like this everywhere I would become vegan. So much variety. I'll be back."}
{"text":"YUMMY! When I think of Vegas \"raw\" and \"vegan\" do not generally come to mind but now I think whenever Sin City is mentioned in my presence I will begin to salivate thinking of how sinfully delicious the macaroon I had here was; hopefully this reaction doesn't confuse anyone in the wrong way... I'll just direct them to my Yelp page if so!   I am currently on a cross-country road trip to New England.  Las Vegas was our first stop out of California and after spending just one night there I was in dire need of some sustenance and nutrition! Thanks to Yelp I found just what I was looking for in the form of this location of Go Raw Cafe. My friend ordered the Traditional Pizza and after much going back and forth I settled on having the Vegi-cotti, and then devoured it.  In retrospect I wish one of us ordered something different because the ingredients of each seemed pretty identical.  I didn't try hers because mine was huge! The zucchini pasta side was simply amazing and I am now a firm believer in raw  \"pasta\" although I was previously a skeptic.  Maybe it was the intense garlic flavor of the sauce that sold me but regardless it was delicious and I am definitely going to try to recreate my own once I get to my own kitchen and acquire the right utensils. :)   I was stuffed from my meal but we heard some other diners, and the owner herself, raving about a dessert.  It turned out that the owner had made up a coconut macaroon the day before and decided to sell/serve them.  For about a buck a pop and as small as a quarter I figured it couldn't do too much damage.  WOAH! There was so much flavor packed into that little morsel of delight!  I used to love the Girl Scout cookies previously known as Samoas (excuse my non-PC terminology; I don't know the new name and haven't had them in years!) and although the taste of this macaroon brought them back to mind they were 100 times better and I am sure at least 10 times healthier for you, somehow!  This place gets all of my stars and then some.  I may just be convinced to brave taking my liver back to Vegas if it means I can try out some more menu items!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!  I've been to the other location for lunch but I stopped in this one for a juice. I got the Green Zing. It was amazing!  Collard greens, parsley, celery, ginger, lemon, green apple, and kale. I love it! I also bought some flax crackers and flax tortillas. They have a breakfast bar, it's vegan and they offer cooked items. I'll say it again, I wish I had a place like this close to home!"}
{"text":"Raw-mazing!!!  This place is fantastic. The menu is HUGE!  It was hard to choose but I went with the Chips, Salsa and Guacamole for starters. Three people shared and it was plenty. The chips are so good, they make them and also sell them at Whole Foods. I  got the Veggie Wrap, with avocado, onions, almond cheese, sprouts, cucumbers and carrots wrap in collard greens. The side was a beet slaw, also amazing!  My sister got the Beet Burger, which was to die for. My husband got the Mediterranean Wrap, I didn't try it but he loved it! They have juices, desserts and more. All raw all vegan!  They have a little shop inside, they sell books, nut butters, bars, sauces and so much more. What a gem this place is, you must try it!  I'd love to come back. I wish I had this place back home."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Soooooo... I'm not very healthy on the inside right now. Been taking a TON of antibiotics for a chest infection. Decided to eat #raw to help my body heal itself. I ordered the house salad, portobello burger and, \"liver something\" juice. So delicious! I already feel better. I love salads for the taste of the actual vegetables.. Which were so properly proportioned in deliciousness (poetic). Right down to the young man in dreads with the kind eyes who helped me. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I just dined at this spot for the first time yesterday evening with a dear friend.  I am so glad she introduced me to Go Raw.  I wasn't certain what to order so I selected the pizza and she had the veggie pasta.  I'm glad we only ordered 1/2 sizes as the portions are generous.  Initially I was a little sad everything is cold, I know it is a raw spot but the weather is chilly and I wanted to warm up a bit.  I didn't mind the temp of the food at all once I had a warm cup of chamomile tea.  The pizza was seasoned perfectly and the crust was yummy and crunchy.  The veggies were very fresh.  I would order the pizza again. . . in fact I may return tomorrow!  I also shared my friend's veggie pasta, it was fantastic!  Who knew raw food could be so amazing?!  Well. . . now I know, and I will be back to try some more treats.  The very best part of the meal was how I felt after, I felt contently full with out that weighed down feeling.  The staff are super friendly and helpful.  I want to try the curry soup next.  If you are looking to try something different, give Go Raw a shot!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm not a vegan. In fact, when my hubby picked me up for lunch and surprised me by taking me to this little hidden restaurant, I was a wee bit nervous about finding something on the menu I would like. Instead, I just returned to my office, handed my co-worker the menu, insisted she go eat there for lunch, and sat down to write this review. Yup, it was THAT good.   When we walked in, we were greeted by Areeya who informed us that the salads and pizzas (on gluten free crust) were something that were favorited by most since we were new to the place. So, that's exactly what we got, a half House Salad with the House dressing and a full Traditional Pizza. We got our salad first and it was a smorgasbord of fresh veggies (avocado, bell pepper, cucumber, mixed greens, sprouts) and nuts mixed with the house dressing which tasted fresh and garlicy. Then came the pizza, which the menu claims is 'unlike any you've ever had'... and this is why that statement is true: The gluten free crust isn't a thin piece tasteless cardboard like one would expect, it is a thick, delicious, buckwheat crust that was the perfect consistency for piling on the delicious pesto marinara, basil, cauliflower, almonds, & walnuts. The flavors were extraordinary!   I'm not a total health nut and I'm definitely not a vegan but this place serves up DELICIOUS healthy food and I cannot wait to return to try more items from the menu.  TIP: If you're ordering for lunch, call ahead and place your order - It did take a little while to get the food."}
{"text":"Avoid eating here at any cost. I stopped in here for lunch today and the cashier first yells at me for trying to serve my self some pita chips from the SELF SERVE salad bar. I said no problem and continued on with the other choices. Thirty seconds later she yelled loudly that I was standing to close to the Salad bar and then began to swear in Spanish. As a successful business man I value great customer service and friendly staff. Being screamed at by staff when your simply trying to catch a meal isn't acceptable."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, highly disappointed. No greeting when you walk in. Told the rep it was my first time and she just handed me a menu. Service is super slow. The environment is not friendly at all. Usually with healthy places you get an upbeat personal, definitely not the case here. Got the smoothie, which was okay... No protein adds available. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I went in and grabbed a bunch of their raw snacks and two raw desserts. I also ordered a juice. Super expensive, from the juice being eight dollars to the snacks going from a six dollar cookie to a thirteen dollar small bag of crackers.  Now, I love the concept of Vegan and raw, yet for the price, I would like to enjoy the food and not taste cardboard. The desserts were horrible and the other snacks were extremely bland. The juice was WAY too thick.  Basically, a rip off. No one should have to pay this much to eat tasteless food for health."}
{"text":"Love this place! If they had a convenient drive thru I would be there once a week at least. Instead I'm only there maybe once every couple of months. It is a little pricey but isn't everything organic these days??? My go to is Popeye's. It is a juice with carrots, apple and spinach. But I like to throw a little zip with some ginger. Food is really good too. Especially after I have been eating out and having a lot of rich and heavy foods. I really like the Perfect Pasta with is not pasta at all. It's yummy shredded zucchini tossed with garlic, olive oil and other yumminess. Wraps are great too! They have lots of healthy items for sale too suck as lotions, healthy snacks and supplements. While I was there I picked up some really yummy spicy chipotle kale chips, energy squares, local raw honey and bee pollen from Pahrump."}
{"text":"The food was just okay. I really enjoy health food and raw eating :) Love my fruits and veggies. Eating here tasted overly \"healthy\" to me. It was bland. Tried with some friends for lunch; we had the pasta with collard greens, a wrap, and a salad. I must say that the food tasted like it was missing something but I just cannot out my finger on it. I might eat here again but it definitely didn't make an impression on me (good or bad)."}
{"text":"There is no better raw food place in town. It's expensive but worth it. I have tried pretty much everything and it is all good. Try the hummus and the Mexicali pizza. It can't be easy to get fresh food in the desert so I'm sure that causes a price increase."}
{"text":"So grateful for Go Raw!  From the menu - house salad | kale salad with cilantro dressing. Those are in the current rotation. I was stuck on the Beet Burger and the Mexicali Pizza for years - those are great too. The new coffee cream dessert in the fridge is one of my all time favorite desserts. It is up there with the raw mint chocolate chip ice cream I had at Pure Food and Wine in NYC.  In short...go there."}
{"text":"So grateful for Go Raw!  I like the GV location better because they do have a few cooked options when my little belly wants some warmth. Plus I am partial to GV.  From the menu - house salad | kale salad with cilantro dressing. Those are in the current rotation. I was stuck on the Beet Burger and the Mexicali Pizza for years - those are great too. The new coffee cream dessert in the fridge is one of my all time favorite desserts. It is up there with the raw mint chocolate chip ice cream I had at Pure Food and Wine in NYC.  The salad bar is small, but all I need. The fresh cut fruit (esp the pineapple is always phenomenal.)  Last, but not least drink #28 - I think it's 28??? It is the last one on the menu - the superfood (supergood) smoothie. It's $10 but a meal in itself.  In short...go there."}
{"text":"Gah this place makes you feel so healthy, like you could run eight miles carrying a baby elephant. It is confusing for new people, you have to order in the far back of the store, and pay back there as well. The part of the store where you have tables to eat isn't manned a lot, so in theory people could eat and run without paying :(. This is a RAW food cafe, meaning that the food you get is NOT cooked. That's what raw means...so you've been informed.  My friend took us here to try it out, she got the Italian Sampler and I chose the 'Cheese' Burger. Everything is made with organic veggies and vegan almond cheese, along with live bread (which is NOT cooked, dur). The cheese was a little dry for my tastebuds, it kind of overpowered the flavor of the bean sprouts and excellent house made catsup and mustard. The bread was really tasty, and the fries are slices of avocado rolled in what looks like crumbs served with the catsup (SO GOOOOD!) Every plate comes with a garnish of bean sprouts and a slice of apple and orange to cleanse your palate.  My friend really liked the pasta she had, which was really zucchini, and the lasanga, but the toast with the tomato and cheese was overpowered by the cheese as well, but still very tasty. We got boxes of fudge to go, which is nuts, oats, honey and carob chocolate squares, not at all dry but very moist and sweet.  I want to go back and get a bowl of their soup and a smoothie sometime!"}
{"text":"This place is not new, but it's the real deal.  Staff walks the walk, not just talking about healthy and organic....like some other places.  Their juice drinks are 100% SO GOOD.  It's a little more $$$ than a lot of other lunch places, but you definately get what you pay for.  They have cooking classes you can sign-up for ( I always mean to, but never do).  The pizza is not like any pizza ever...really creative with the menu too.  I love the way it smells in there too!"}
{"text":"Alright well I will attempt to make this review as Raw as possible, My boss is on this Go Raw kick and decided that we were having Go Raw Cafe for lunch. The menu was put on my desk and I took a close look and needless to say I picked the closest to normal thing I could find on the menu which to me happened to be the house salad. He mentioned they make the salads gigantic so just order a half.   When I arrived at the Cafe I walked in and I must admit it smelled a little odd. I put that off that I am used to walking into places that cook the food you are eating and that have a smell of some sort of meat or fryer. Unfortunately I cannot pin point what the smell was. I then ordered the salads, which yes, they were huge. The lady that was working on our salads guaranteed me that I would love it and I would be back. Now, Let me take just a moment and acknowledge that she was very enthusiastic and upbeat when it came to pitching the company, but I wonder if I ordered it to eat in instead of to go, would the pitch had been the same.  Let me just break it down why I am only giving 2 stars.   1. Yes the salad was huge, but sometimes quantity over quality is not a good thing  2. The overwhelming smell was a huge set back for me  3. The salad was overly plain, nothing spectacular  This place is just not for me and it is one of those places that I think you need to be fully into the Vegan lifestyle to truly appreciate a place like this. I am in not saying that this place all around sucks but I am saying that I will not be back."}
{"text":"It's very hard to find vegan restaurants in las vegas.  This one has great service (they'll know you by name). And if you have special orders, they remember.  Some of the food is a little out-there, but that's to be expected. I recommend the mushroom wrap (with extra fake cheese). The smoothies are also great (try adding chocolate/carob chips)."}
{"text":"This restaurant has two locations. The Windmill location is located within what appears to me to be a lower-scale plaza and has a pretty unassuming appearance.    Inside there's a kind of New Agey vibe. You'll find all kinds of books about nutrition, raw food recipes, and improving your health.  This place attracts a diverse group of people, which is part of the fun for me in coming here.  The food is the other part of the fun: great-tasting raw entrees  such as enchiladas, pizza and sushi - my three favorites.   At this location there is a salad bar, which is an excellent way to sample some raw foods in small doses if you are new to eating this way.   The juices and deserts are heavenly!  While some of the dishes are an acquired taste (and the menu is a little pricey) I greatly appreciate this establishment and will continue to eat here as often as I can.  They have a second location further north at \"The Lakes Center,\" 2910 Lake East Drive. It is smaller and has a juice bar rather than a salad bar, and hosts raw food demonstration classes occasionally.  You should go!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place while on a recent trip to Vegas with a fellow vegan friend for the weekend.  Have been eating raw from the beginning of the year and was excited to find a restaurant to break up the monotony.  This was the most amazing place!  Fantastic food and great people.  It was my friend's birthday and they were gracious enough to find a candle for his cheesecake.  :-)    Going through hot vegan mocha withdrawal..."}
{"text":"Kind of on your own when you walk in, but after you manage to get your order in the food is packed with flavor and very healthy."}
{"text":"Ok,  Im not gonna bash the place. We went tonight and were in a hurry so we did to go. The place is awesome. It had a great grocery section and the staff was amazing and friendly. It just wasn't what we expected. My mistake for not looking into this place first because nothing is cooked. Everything is cold. They're very creative with the dishes. If this is what we expected before coming in it wouldn't have been an issue. It would have gotten five stars except one thing. The portions are very tiny and its very pricey for the small portions . I might be vegan but I still can eat! If your very hungry make sure you get two or three orders of something. I will be back because my lasagna was really good, 100% vegan and healthy!   I highly recommend this place just come in with an open mind and throw out your expectations of a normal restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is really yummy. I never felt uncomfortable but I have had nonveggie friends tell me that they did. The house salad is hands down the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Last night I enjoyed the \"Neat Loaf\" at Go Raw Cafe on the Lake.  The view is amazing, and the paintings inside the cafe are phenomenal.  I was just expecting a regular cafe, but they have an array of superfoods, vitamins, and books for sell as well.  I just moved to vegas from ohio, and this is now going to be one of my regular spots.  I look forward to trying the Beet Burger with Fries next time!"}
{"text":"The food will pleasantly surprise any food eater (not just for veggie-heads). The service was fast at lunch and dinner. The presentation is beautiful. The dishes are so amazingly delicious that I am truly grateful this place exists and I was able to visit! After eating I felt happy, healthy, energized and light. Best of all it had me satisfied and feeling wonderfully plant-strong. I strongly encourage you to give this place a try... you will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"Big fan of their Acai bowl.. Wish that the portion was a little more and added more fruits being that it cost 10 bucks.. Salad bar is great! little on the pricey side, but cant really complain too much since most of their items are fresh. You could really smell it as soon as you walk in.. Plenty of reading materials, limited amount of seats, but it isn't that busy especially during the lunch hours of the work week... overall great location, plenty of parking, and staff is ok.."}
{"text":"Great juices and friendly service.  Also great shakes and meals for those wanting a healthy option."}
{"text":"Very creative and tasty raw vegan menu.  Salads are excellent.  Also beet burger, neet loaf, pizza, lasagna and desserts are very good.  Lots of juicing, smoothies and and other raw food delicacies to nourish you.  Ambience and service are pleasant w/lots of vegan products and books to take home to learn more.  Remember nothing is cooked.  De-humidifyers are used to make sprouted bread and \"baked\" goods."}
{"text":"i love this spot! such cute art work and employees are helpful! i got the house salad and the veggie sushi roll... they were absolutely delicious!! the roll was a fair size and the fillings were delish! i loved the enoki mushrooms! i also bought their dehydrated onion rings and they were a nice change from kale chips..  if im in vegas again i will definitely be back! oh... and i loved the little ducks outside!"}
{"text":"I begin with a quote from the Go Raw Café website, \"Go Raw Café features fine, organic, live, vegan cuisine.\" I was hooked as soon as I read that line. I know I can find the nutritional sustenance I promote for my family here. The food is fresh, pure, and made with care. Healthy foods means a healthy family, for this I am thankful the Café is here.  I am grateful for all Go Raw Café offers. I have dined here many times. I enjoy the juices, the smoothies, homemade chips, soups; just bring me anything from the menu. It's all good. It's all crisp. It's all delicious.  I enjoy the book selection and shelves of pantry items. I can get raw crackers, cacao nibs, and kale chips, to name a few items. For me or for a gift, I have found plenty of surprises I appreciate.  If only there was a drive-thru, I would be here daily. But, I know the careful work that is placed meticulously for each dish is worth the patience, effort, and time to slow myself down and enjoy table service dining."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and I have also gotten the salad bar. I LOVE the idea of raw, and I lOVE raw food. May favorite thing to get here is at the salad bar. I like to get a  cup of guacamole and mango and parsley kale salad. MmMMMMM.  I have tried some of the wraps, the pizza. All wonderful, I could eat this every day.  Only negative is the price. Totally ridiculous. Id rather take 14.88 ( price of  your raw pizza) and buy a ton of produce and make it all at my house and still have twice as much left.  Sorry. The place is great but the prices are killer. Lower a bit and you might turn more mainstream people on to this."}
{"text":"I love this place :-) The food is fresh, and interesting, service is fast, and I feel good after eating it. I don't eat here much since it is a little pricey for me, but worth it though. Try the burger and avocado \"fries\"!"}
{"text":"I love Go Raw Café! My husband and I are vegan as well as gluten-free, so it's difficult to find food that fits our diet - let alone tasty food! We are so happy we found this place. You can really taste the freshness, and everything is really delicious. We've been here everyday for the past week. Our favorites are the veggie-cotti, veggie wrap, and the beet burger."}
{"text":"I went here excited to try one of the smoothies today. I decided I wanted to get a super smoothie, so I chose the tropical smoothie with the fruit stew on top.   The lady rang me up for 2 smoothies instead of one, I had ordered some food as well so I didn't realize how off the price was until I asked for the receipt. When I asked the woman at the register to correct the order she started raising her voice and said that I had in fact order this extra smoothie. I told her this was my first time at the cafe and maybe I didn't understand the way to order but I am positive I never ordered the #28. She began to show me what she had wrote down and shows me the menu in a way to I guess try to \"prove me wrong\" instead of just correcting the order and giving me back the extra $ I had paid.   At this point she was so extremely rude and would not get a manager for me, that I just wanted my whole order canceled. She told me I couldn't have my money back because they had already started making the food. Once I explained to her that I work with customers every day in my career and would never talk down to any of my clients like that, she finally gave me my money back.  I'm disappointed that I couldn't try the food and smoothie because I am positive I would have been back considering that I am in this area quite often. I will NOT be back ever."}
{"text":"I have to admit the reason why I gave this location in particular three star is because of the location itself. It was such a hassle for myself in order to find this place (did anyone else have trouble too?) For a raw & organic cafe, I can't believe how tucked away it is from everything else on the west side of town! Sure, the lake view side is beautiful, but I'm a little puzzled at how this place gets business if their location is nearly secretive from everything else on the west side of Vegas? Well, the location sort of does make it seem like a cafe sort of atmosphere you would find in California, but I really did wish the location would be more out in the open in the area!  Compared to the one on the east side, the area is very cramped & small (once again it has the California cafe-esque type atmosphere). Their food is just as delicious as the one on Windmill, & they have quite an extensive selection of books at this location (even a more privatized area to browse, unlike the Windmill cafe). The staff here seemed to have really good relations with the locals who come here, since the day I went there seemed to be a revolving door of people that knew each other & were at the most happy (which made me felt a little more homey at this location).   Same great menu at this location, just a real pain to get to!"}
{"text":"The drawback is obviously how over-priced some portions are (& you feel like you're not really getting anything for what you're buying, but usually raw foods are like that when you buy them from a restaurant). This location is the closest to where I live, so I have been here three separate times & have to admit their food is actually very filling. A lot of their menu items are very easy to duplicate at home as well if you're on a budget, but I would say come here to try out what they got & be adventurous!  I have ordered the veggie wrap all three times, & the full order is definitely more than filling. While I wish they could provide just a *little* more house slaw to go on the side, at the same time, raw organic places usually practice their philosophy of small, fresh portions. Great selection of reading material at this location, I've found a couple useful books I've been reading since I discovered them here. I also prefer this location than the one on the west side of town because it's a lot more spacious & open (you'll know what I mean if you ever visit the two places).  This is a great place to start experimenting raw & organic foods if you're curious to know what kind of dishes & meals you can do with raw eating."}
{"text":"My first Raw Food cafe experience! Food had a lot of flavor and the portions were good.  I ordered the traditional raw Pizza and the Mango coconut toast. Tasted great, kept me full, made me feel great and gave me energy for the rest of the day! Service is friendly and laid back here.  I enjoyed browsing the books and grocery section while we waited for our meal (which didn't take long!). Beet burger was also good! Will definitely come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"If you're not familiar with Raw food... It's a little different. I got the vegicotta and mexi pizza. Not awful but maybe I'll just get the smoothies. My dad is a huge fan of durian and he really loved the durian shake."}
{"text":"Great little place, very nice owners. So many different fresh juices and smoothies and meals can only recommend it.! Give it a shot ..."}
{"text":"my fav row cafe in Las Vegas.I usually have salad and green juice here. If its not too cold outside,its nice to eat outside. There is a lake in front of the restaurant,so you can enjoy the view as well."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Its great to have such a raw, organic, local place here in Vegas!  The location is perfect overlooking the lake and I can't help but love the food and juice selection.   The only reason they do not get 5 starts is because the juice is way over-priced and they skimp on the beets! =(  I can make much more affordable juices at home."}
{"text":"If you enjoy raw vegan living cuisine, then this is for you.    Personally, I enjoy raw vegan more than cooked vegan or vegetarian.  There a more gourmet quality to me.    I've visited both this store and their other store on the East side of Las Vegas.  Have had all sorts of dishes, smoothies and juices and all have been tasty, well-presented and satisfying.    If you've never tasted raw vegan dishes, then treat yourself.  I suspect you'll be very pleasantly surprised.  Your body will certainly love you for it.  Just don't expect a $5 meal.  Prepared raw (at a restaurant) I've always found to be a bit more pricey and that's to be expected with fresh, organic prep."}
{"text":"My first time here ,Had the veggie wrap but didn't realized it really wrap with veggie,haha....I actually enjoyed it!! Had their green zing juice, it was kinda expensive for the size!!! It says large only ,  but its like a medium size cup!!!! I will go back to try other stuff on the menu though!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter's 15tb Birthday dinner, she is a Vegan & wanted to try this place, 4 of us sat down, server came over, I told her we are new to there resturant, NO HELP, NO SUGESTIONS, WE just Got, salad bar 8 something a pound. Oh ya, we interrupted her on her ,  Will never go back!!!"}
{"text":"Love the beet burger! The texture is also good!   Only problem for me is that the Avocado fries were actually tooo oily & cream-added, which made me feell a little bit nauseated..."}
{"text":"If you're going to go raw in Vegan, this is the place to do it!  This restaurant is soooo amazing! The burritos are very tasty.  You have to try their juices as well; they're impressive!"}
{"text":"Great green drinks and superfood smoothies. My favorite item is their tiramisu - \"Coffee Cream\" raw desert.   The gourmet flavour aspect on some of the items doesn't measure up to many of the restaurants I eaten at in LA, SF, NY or Chicago, but still, it's not half bad. Almost everything is raw and vegan, so you really can't go wrong here.  Go Raw has 2 locations. This west-side one is especially nice, because it is next to a man-made lake."}

{"text":"Everything I've had from here is amazing, smaller store with a great outdoor view of the Lakes. An all around good experience, friendly staff, good products, nice selection and beautiful view!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is amazing. Super cute, by a lake I didn't even know existed and delicious raw food I didn't even know you could eat raw. I got a collard green wrap and replaced hummus with guacamole. My friend ordered a tostada. Both meals were incredible. Affordable, super healthy & fresh. Cute, clean atmosphere. Try something new!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite for a healthy option in Vegas. Try the kale salad or the Italian plate."}
