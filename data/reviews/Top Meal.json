{"text":"I ordered the steak kabob and chicken kabobs.  The chicken was satisfactory but the steak was too salty and impossible to chew.  It was given generoysly to the garbage can. Very light on the taziki sauce even when I asked for lots.  Ordered with a Salad and it was hardly anything except for a handful of iceberg.  It was quite honestly one of the worst meals I ever ate.  $23 including tax and vitamin water."}
{"text":"Amazing food , amazing stuff , one of the best persian food , every time i come here enjoying food and tea"}
{"text":"So far the best Barg kabob I had in GTA. They are among one of yhe few who actually use the right type of high-quality meat that is traditionally used for making Barg."}
{"text":"Food: I always get their chicken kebab and my friends would get their beef kebabs. They taste soooo good and the portions are pretty huge because it comes with ample rice and salad. The rice is also really good!! Put hot sauce on the kebabs! Soo good.   Seating: There is seating inside, but you can also get it to go. The service is always fast.   Parking: It's in a plaza with a pretty big parking lot so it should be easy to find parking even during peak hours such as lunch."}
{"text":"This is nestled in a plaza & a great lunch place. Healthy & delicious food & their chicken kabobs are tender & beef koobide kabob to die for as well!  A typical meal is kabob with rice & salad. Rice is fluffy & delish & they have a white sauce that is better than anything I've ever tasted it. A great family owned business that has exceptional food. My favourite lunch and after work take out. Great value, portions & food is 5* plus!"}
