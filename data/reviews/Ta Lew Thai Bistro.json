{"text":"Cute little place and even better food! This location was formerly The Spot restaurant. I'm so glad Ta Lew moved into this place. I always get the Pad See Ew with chicken, it's my favorite! They will make it as spicy as you want. So delicious! Try them out."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing customer service, they made an effort to remember my name and order from my first visit. Great food and lunch specials. I try to eat there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Great food, smells, and staff! This hidden gem seems small on the exterior but is really two stories inside. Have dinner on the balcony looking down into the restaurant for a treat!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Food is excellent, and staff is very friendly.
Again, food is very tasty and very authentic as well!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food around! Wife and I have explored many different Thai restaurants and this is by far the best one! Drunken noodles, fried rice and the wonton soup is our favorite! All the entrees we order regular hot fresh chili style and it comes out perfect! Just the right amount of heat! Great customer service as well!!"}
{"text":"THIS food is AMAZING! We had yellow curry and pineapple fried rice. Food was absolutely on point! 

The restaurant is super clean and quaint and offers great customer service. Will be going back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent Yellow Curry and Tom Kha! Love it! Best Thai in Gilbert by a long shot! Service was great even though they were very busy."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS WAAAAY TOO EXPENSIVE!!!!! Ordered a bowl of TomYum , 10.76 and asked for a side of rice with it, 3.00 for something that literally costs 3.00 for 5lbs. All I had was a card and they refused to run it because each transaction has to be min 5.00? Resiculous, they will never get my business again."}
{"text":"This little Thai place has become my go-to when I'm craving pad Thai. I'd say it is the best (by far) I've had in AZ. They have a great selection of Thai standards and some cool specialty dishes. 

Great service every time I've visited (admittedly more often than I should at times- but I reserve the rice noodles for a workout day!!).  Something cool about a family run, authentic and cool place. Totally perfect in Gilbert. 

I always double up the protein and they are very reasonable to accommodate.  

One of the hidden gems in the east valley."}
{"text":"After 10+ years in Arizona, we'd pretty much come to the conclusion that we weren't going to find good Thai food out here. Ta Lew recently opened near our home, so we decided to give it a try.

The building is 2 stories and narrow and had only a few small tables. They do most of their business in take out. We decided to dine in. The staff was super friendly and helpful and answered all our questions. 

We ordered the chicken satay, the pad see ew with beef, orange chicken, and pork fried rice. The portions are huge and we ended up having lots of leftovers for the next day. All of the food was tasty, well seasoned, and cooked well. The veggies were fresh and not overcooked. The meats were tender and cooked perfectly (the beef in the pad see ew was grilled and tasted amazing). You could tell they used real orange and ginger in the orange chicken. Everything we ate was delicious. 

This is the best Thai food we've had in Arizona. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING and I am so glad to have a new gem like this so close to home! The owner is super friendly and explained that her brother does most of the cooking, but her mom makes all of the curries. I went with my mom and she had the red curry and I had the green curry. We had not had Thai curry that tasted this good since we were in Hawaii! We were absolutely blown away!!! They let you customize the spice level to your preference and the lunch price was so reasonable. For lunch, our curries came with rice, a salad, and an egg roll. This will become a new regular place for us to come and enjoy amazing food."}
{"text":"Tried  this place a again  and again was greatly  disappointed. The pad thai was dry, over cooked and flavorless. I think they prepare the pad thai way in advance and just leave it simmering so the noodles get over cooked and dry out. Will definitely  not be back. Our favorite  place is tum nak  thai but they were closed tonight for some  reason."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food has been delicious every time, great customer service, and nice inviting seating  (although I have only ever had take out)"}
{"text":"Amazing service! So friendly! Thai tea was so delicious. The food was great! This has become my new favorite Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Nothing better unless you're in Thailand...serious. Forget everything around you except how the food tastes. I get take out there every night I'm home, between trips. Gilbert is lucky to have this place. I'm lucky to live right around the corner. ;)"}
{"text":"Yes, it is a Bistro, meaning it is small in size, but GIGANTIC in flavor.
By far the best thai food I've had in the valley. Feels like home made with lots of love, lots of flavor and real thai techniques.
Recommended!! If you have to wait, then I suggest you to be patient because it will be absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  This place was recommended by our kids and it was even better than advertised. The green curry, and wonton soup were great. And don't forget the coconut ice cream."}
{"text":"Dumplings were delicious! Tom Kha was delicious! Pad see ew was delicious! Everyone working was super nice! Hooray!"}
{"text":"The absolute BEST Red Thai Curry ever. Truly enjoyed our dinner tonight.. Can't wait to return..."}
{"text":"This is the best, most fresh Thai food I've eaten.  I've not had a single bad dish there.  The yellow curry is outstanding."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now and have not been disappointed. Very good , food service, and very clean. Love how they mix ground and sliced chicken in the pad Thai I had today."}
{"text":"We are so glad we found this Thai restaurant. We love Thai food and the food here is DELICIOUS!!!  we moved from Chicago where there are many great Thai restaurants. Ta Lew Thai Bistro is authentic Thai cuisine! We love it!  Compliments to the chef!"}
{"text":"First time in last night, the staff was great. Immediately greeted us and let us choose a table. Had our drinks quickly and they were never empty. 
Ordered the crab wontons appetizer. They were fresh, hot, and tasty. 
I got the panang curry (in mild since I hadn't been there before) it was delicious and enough for two!
My fiance got the beef drunken noodles,  also a huge portion and very yummy. 
I would definitely recommend this restaurant, it was not too crowded and a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best Tai food around! There food is so fresh and delicious. I love the Pad Tai and my wife always try's something new and raves every time. It is a small place but the food is well worth the wait! I'm getting hungry thinking about it! The family that runs Ta Lew is so nice."}
{"text":"Food was very flavorful with just the right amount of kick. Staff was helpful and kind. Will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"AWESOME PLACE. Big portions, good price, friendly staff. 10/10 would come back. Ordered the pad thai, green curry, and the drunken noodles (ALL DELICIOUS)."}
{"text":"Went here about a month ago and have been meaning to write a review since! Very Cute quaint restaurant! The Pad Thai with veggies and the Yellow Curry was amazing!! One of the best I've had! Plus the owner even introduced herself and made sure our visit was pleasant! Great food, great atmosphere and outstanding customer service all around!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. The restaurant is small, so we usually order take out, but have eaten here several times and enjoyed our experience. The Thai curry dishes are excellent and have lots of flavor."}
{"text":"This was the best Thai food I've ever had! Had the pineapple fried rice and yellow curry. The flavors were so good! Small restaurant but very modernly decorated. The employees were so nice and helpful in making recommendations. I will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Terrific food! Two things keep me from five stars: the last time I was there I was turned away because they didn't have enough help. Crazy!  Also, as everyone else on here states, the seating is very limited.  If it's busy, you won't get a table unless you arrive really early.  Plan on takeout.  The owner is wonderful and genuinely caring.  I hope for a better experience the next time I'm there.  I hope it doesn't get too popular because then I'll never get in!"}
{"text":"Service was great, the staff was friendly! If you're looking for Thai in Gilbert you should try it out!"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food. I normally get the Pad See Ew. I like it pretty spicy and I always order it \"crazy Thai hot\". Sometimes it's not spicy even a little bit even at the highest level. It's not a big enough deal to keep me from coming back though ;)"}
{"text":"The food is always fresh, cooked to order.  I love the lemon grass soup (full of veggies) and just about everything else I've tried.  It is a small place with seating on 2 levels.  I just wish it was a bigger restaurant with a more extensive menu.  I miss some of my favorites, like drunken noodles.  The service is great and fast."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the area!  Tiny place if you're going to eat there, but great to take out.  Pad Thai is awesome!  So is the vegetable fried rice.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here on recommendation from a friend.  Drive past it all the time.  Good local Thai restaurant.  Started with dumplings and chicken satay.  Wished the peanut sauce was a little spicier. We shared mussamun curry with chicken, pas wee ew with beef,  and  garlic chicken.  All spiced medium.  All were good.  Plenty to share for 5 of us.  Need to go back and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"The pad Thai is really good here! Their curries are also really good, great base, lots of meat and vegetables. Mmmmm of you live in the area give it a try!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, owner and staff give a great vibe, the pad Thai is fantastic. Take out is a great option here, many people call in. Support local businesses and enjoy great Thai!"}
{"text":"This is some of the freshest and tastiest Thai food I've ever had. The staff is alway so friendly and my food is always made to order and so delicious! I have loved having this restaurant so close to home!"}
{"text":"Love this hidden gem. Great food and service! We keep coming back. Some of my favorites...,Thai basil with chicken, yellow curry, dragon princess, Pad Thai, and Sticky Rice with Mango. Thai iced tea is awesome too!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food around.  The server was friendly and very informative.  The vegetable medley was so flavorful and fresh.  I have had the Pad Thai, cashew chicken, orange chicken and shrimp with asparagus.  Enjoyed all of them.  Can't wait to try something new off their menu."}
{"text":"Food is good.The only concern I have is that the food is wayyy to expensive. I mean what we are talking about here is noodles and rice. I would be here more often if it wasn't as expensive."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!! 

First day time here tonight.  I was skeptical. I have to say this is some of the best Thai food I have ever eaten!  We had Tom ka soup, green curry, and fried banana w/ coconut ice cream.  Portions are big enough to share, but I enjoy taking the extra home for more meals!  If you like Thai, you need to come here.  If you've never had Thai, you need to come here.  

Owners were super nice too!"}
{"text":"Just found this place on Yelp this morning and stopped by to try it for lunch. The family that owns the restaurant seemed really nice. The decor and setup was seriously so cute, modern, and clean. Not a ton of seating inside but was enough room. The menu was laid out really well and super fun. They carry Pepsi products and have traditional Thai drinks. The lunch specials are only $8 and come with entree, salad, and egg roll. The salad was mixed greens with a yummy peanut dressing and the lettuce was great quality and in great condition. Seems silly to mention but I ate at CPK yesterday and sent my salad back due to all the bad lettuce so yes, I am impressed how great the lettuce was here. The spring roll was super fresh, crunchy, hot, and delicious. My mom got the pork fried rice which was so flavorful, not greasy at all, and really tasty! I got the yellow curry with chicken. All the meat and veggies were outstanding quality, fresh, and great portions for the price! We want to try everything lol and the soup sounded and looked delicious too. I would highly recommend trying this restaurant. Some of the best Thai food I've had in Arizona. We will absolutely be back! Wish I had taken pics but had the baby and was not easy to grab my phone at the time lol! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had! Fantastic small business, delicious food, and great service. I always seem to be here multiple times each month and can't say enough great things."}
{"text":"I like that the food here is tasty yet not too salty as many restaurants can be. Generous portions, too. I look forward having this food again!"}
{"text":"With several people waiting outside for the doors to open at 5pm, I thought this could restaurant could be promising. They did not disappoint.

The Staff if very friendly, and the service was almost immediate.Their menu is simple but captures all the favorites. 

Food was solid. I got their special - \"Evil Jungle Princess\". 

Would absolutely come back again!"}
{"text":"Good food, but wish it was self serve. Don't like having to have a waitress.  Service is nothing great."}
{"text":"We have had a hard time getting in because the place is very small. The food is nothing short of great though. Highly recommended. My wife and I have dined at most of the Thai restaurants in the area and this joint has the best food."}
{"text":"Absolutely our favorite Thai place, hands down! The food is delicious and fresh, and the owner Tenny is so friendly and greets us by name every time we come in. She even knows exactly what we order! My favorite is Red Curry with Beef. My husband loves the Yellow Curry, or the Pad Thai. Lunch portions are cheap, and filling, dinner portions are HUGE! Enough for lunch the next day, YAY!"}
{"text":"Loved this spot! The restaurant is small and seating is limited (maybe 5 tables inside and 5 outside), but it's perfect for a mostly to-go little bistro. Fabulous food, great staff. Clean restaurant & easy to find on Higley road!"}
{"text":"Love it! Veggie rolls are amazing.... amazing. The service quick and polite.  The food comes out quick."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, my family and I are regulars. It's super tiny and they have two floors and a patio. They get packed on weekends so we try to order for delivery or pick up. During the week they are slower and have great service. I really like their pad thai I just order without egg to make it vegan. My mom's favorite are their curries. They make them with coconut curry and they are really rich. Their portions are huge and we always have leftovers which taste great the next day. Our go to's are the yellow curry and the pad kee mao. This is a great place for vegans and vegetarians and most of their dishes have options for tofu or veggies or can be made vegan pretty easily."}
{"text":"The best Thai food around! I had the pad Thai and it had amazing flavor and taste! Also tried the yellow curry and it is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Ta Lew Thai was soooooo flavorful & yummy!!! My husband & I recently moved from San Diego/Orange County & are really picky with our Thai food. After dining here I can honestly say that we have finally found a Thai Restaurant with high quality ingredients, good portions, a very modern & clean environment that meets our high standards of really great Thai food!
Our group had several dishes & everyone was over the moon pleased with their dishes.  I had the green curry & have been craving it again ever since! The eggplant melted in my mouth & was the perfect balance of sweet & spicy. The other members of our group had several other curry dishes, larb, soups, pad thai & thai fried rice.
I must also recommend the Thai Tea (a personal fav of mine, which they nailed!) 
Our server was so attentive & friendly too! 
We used to frequent Tum Nak Thai & Thai Chili but we have now found our new favorite Thai location!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite type of restaurant: small, family owned and terrific food. It's tucked away in a strip mall on Higley south of the 202.  The service was very friendly and accomodating. The food was even better. I had Red Curry Chicken and it was one of the I've ever had. 

This small restaurant needs our support, so I  think I'll go again this evening!"}
{"text":"I had the green curry lunch special.  It included a small salad that had a delicious peanut dressing and a spring roll that was cooked perfectly.  The flavor of the curry was spot on and all the ingredients including the egg plant were just right.  The medium spice level I asked for was also spot on.  I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent Curry lunch specials but VERY loud inside (if you're hard of hearing like me you probably won't be able to hear you're mates even with your hearing aids in \"Restaurant\" mode). If you have trouble getting up stairs, hope that one of the few downstairs tables are available. The stairs are steep."}
{"text":"Great food! Had the red curry and my husband had the pineapple fried rice. Very fresh and delicious!  They were short staffed and still managed to get food out in a reasonable time and  kept the drinks filled and checked in. Very friendly and cordial. Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"Of all the restaurants that I've given a 3 star review, this is definitely the one I will frequent the most. It's right across the street from me (as in I can see it from my front door), and I love Thai food. Sadly, Talew is just ok. My family and I still prefer Thai Chili for our neighborhood Thai joint. But, if we're feeling too lazy to drive, we'll hit up Talew.

We got five different dishes and shared them family style at home. I didn't try the basil chicken and the shrimp with asparagus since I'm a vegetarian, but those were the favorite dishes of my family.  The basil chicken we ordered medium, and it was quite spicy. The green and red curries along with the pad thai were also medium, but they seemed very mild to us. I liked that the pad thai wasn't greasy, but it wasn't very flavorful either. The curries were good, but they weren't nearly as good as the same ones from Thai Chili. 

I also tried their fried rice during lunch, and I was disappointed. Unlike the pad thai, it was incredibly greasy. I asked for it spicy, and it wasn't overwhelming. The egg roll on the side tasted like it came from the Costco freezer aisle, and there wasn't any dipping sauce. The side salad did have a nice peanut dressing though.

Talew is nice to have in the neighborhood because it adds some variety, but the food and prices aren't completely satisfying."}
{"text":"Stopped in on this tiny little Thai food restaurant.  Wasn't sure what to expect. But for a little tiny place they sure do deliver a great meal. They made use of every inch of space in this tiny space. 

The food is very delicious and I'm a food snob. They have a limited menu, but that's ok! With what they do serve up, you expect very fresh and tasty Thai food and our meal  was very good and our server was very sweet. 

Will be going back in for more when I'm in the area.... excellent food!"}
{"text":"I thought about giving them 2 stars but decided they don't deserve it.

Summary: Pretty lack luster, bland, high priced, AZ thai food with inconsistent portions across the menu and excessive use of bamboo.

The food was incredibly salty and had a greasy glisten.  The thai curry tasted extremely buttery and very heavy, pass.  The thai basil looked like a noodle dish, but it was just tons of bamboo shoots which essentially overtook the flavor of the entire dish (which wasn't much to begin with besides salt).  The chicken was very pale, dry and crumbly of the few pieces that were in the dish.  Prices were very high for what you get, charging NYC/Boston/Cali prices for suburbia AZ.

Overall very sub standard experience with combative staff members.  Much better experience at Thai Chili over on baseline."}
{"text":"I got the mixed seafood pad thai.  It was ok but didn't have that much sauce."}
{"text":"New Thai restaraunt in Gilbert so we had to check it out because this area really needed it.  We ordered crab puffs for an appetizer which came with a sweet n sour sauce. Delicious! Next we ordered chicken cashew nut. I dont know what kind of sauce it came with but it was spicy and a little tangy. It really enhanced the flavor of the chicken and vegetables. It came with a side dish of rice. Everything was fresh and flavorful. Decent portions, too. They were generous with their portions. Overall, it was very good."}
{"text":"First time here! Stopped in to try some pineapple fried rice, green curry and spicy basil...OMG this place is incredible! Awesome service, food so fresh and flavorful....great joint just to hang at. We  will definitely be back again and again. Two simple little suggestions....fix the wobbly table and get soup containers for left overs..///"}
{"text":"It's  good. We had shrimp pad Thai and chicken pad Thai. It wasn't amazing, but good. The crab fried rice was also good, but it didn't blow my mind. Those three items ended up costing $47, and I felt it was over priced. I liked it, but didn't love it. It won't be a destination place but I would go again if I'm hungry and nearby."}
{"text":"Picked up dinner last night- ordered Pad Thai with pork and Green curry with pork. Was very happy that pork was cooked perfect. Very happy level of spiciness,  was not less then authentic heat levels. I have a hard time with hot being Thai hot, too many places tame down based on me being Caucasian. This place had great fresh food and great spice. Will order take out again.  Only reason I did not give 5 stars is I thought prices were a tad high but food was very good!"}
{"text":"So there has been an argument about Thai Bistro or Thai chili. I'm happy to report that I have won that argument and recently Thai Bistro has topped the charts of my friends thanks to some influence and pushing. The place is solid. It is consistent. It's a great place for ordering out and even dining in! I love the chicken larb salad Thai hot. Everything there has been tasty and fresh. Small dining area but worth it!"}
{"text":"Great, authentic pad thai. Service was very friendly and helpful. I wanted to try the 'Crazy Thai Hot' spice level (I wimped out and ordered just level 1 spice to start) so they brought up the spices and told me how to mix them to get it. It was actually a really nice hot...strong burn to start, wearing off quickly without lingering pain or sweating.

I just got back from Bangkok last month, where i had Pad Thai at a half different restaurants, and this is the most authentic I've had since I've been back."}
{"text":"It's good, but not great. I tried the pad thai, garlic chicken, and egg rolls. Good food with good service but nothing impressive. Who knows, maybe the other dishes are much better!"}
{"text":"We ate dinner here for the first time on 08 MAR 2016 AD. The food was delicious! I ordered a peanut stirfry dish - I can't remember the name. It was delicious however the portion size was small. My wife had the drunken noodles, Vegetarian style. It was also fantastic and the portion size was better.

The prices were fair, the establishment was small but incredibly clean and vibrant. The service was stellar and they told us that 70% of their business is take-out. We will definitely return to dine and will also order take-out in the future.

Lastly, as of this writing, they do not sell any alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"We love this place and the food is delicious.  Just like my mom's! Tenney and Shawn are so welcoming! Can't wait to go back! I'm gonna work my way down the menu and try everything!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Food is reasonable price for the portions and is always delicious."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service, clean with trendy decor, affordable lunch specials, and delicious food!  I had the red curry chicken and it was perfect.  Definitely give this hiddem gem a try!"}
{"text":"So glad I tried this place. Best thai food I have ever had. I will definitely be coming back as a regular customer. Food is really delicious and at a very reasonable price. I definitely will be recommending this place to my family and friends."}
{"text":"I'm so excited to have amazing Thai food in Gilbert! The owner is in her business working, she is involved with her customers, and she makes each experience a personal one. The food is killer. Every dish we've tried has been delicious! It's my new go-to, I-don't-want-to-cook, Panda-Express-is-only-for-hangover restaurant."}
{"text":"We love this place  my favorite is the yellow curry and the mango sticky rice! The service is personal and fantastic! Love, love, love!"}
{"text":"Great food...  greater people!  Always nice and ready to make you happy with your selection.  Food is homeade and as hot as you want it... for me HOT!  The only bad thing is the pad thai is so good it does not alow me to try other menu items... thank you for opening this restraunt!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch special with my mother. She got the Thai Basil and I got the Red Curry. Both were delicious! The lunch special comes with a spring roll and a salad. The lunch portion was a very generous size. The owners are fantastic and very friendly. The ambiance of the restaurant is really nice too. It's just a nice, casual place to eat or get take out. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Good addition to the neighborhood. Previous location was The Spot but really like the Thai menu. The lunch menu is perfect. An entre, salad, and egg roll. The interior is very similar to the old layout if you ever visited the Spot. If not it is a small joint, A couple table inside, and a loft for a a more private sitting area. Not great for large groups unless you plan for takeout. I will definately be returning."}
{"text":"Great Penang curry best we've had since we moved here four years ago.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Gilbert! I've had the Thai fever lately, and this place is by far my number one. I usually go with the Spicy Basil and it is incredible. Will be back here frequently to experiment and try new things. Also love the two story layout - modern, colorful, and friendly. 5 stizzars!!"}
{"text":"Best thai food in the valley- hands down! The curries are amazing, the pineapple fried rice is delicious, the crab puffs are TO DIE FOR (and made with real crab meat), the pad thai is perfect and I even enjoyed the sweet and sour chicken my husband got (although I personally like to be more adventurous!) I've ordered almost everything and love it all! I just keep coming back for more!

I lived in Australia for a while and when I returned I thought I would never find quality thai food again. I've literally tried every thai restaurant in the East Valley and have been impressed with very few of those restaurants, but finally I have found my place to go!! 

The owners are kind and friendly and go the extra effort to make sure everything is perfect for you! I'm so happy to have TA LEW in town so check it out and try it for yourself!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places in the east valley. The food is always good and I love the Tom Yum and Tom Kha Ga. it's a little on the small side, but they make up for it with big flavor."}
{"text":"What a great little hole in the wall. We're new in town and just searched Yelp on the fly. We were incredibly impressed. I got the seafood Thai basil and my husband got a seafood Thai ginger. They were amazing. Not just junk seafood. Mussels, bay scallops, fried fish, shrimp, crab. It was delicious. Their fried wontons are made fresh and delicious as well. Thai tea was also great. This will definitely be a place that we will be returning to."}
{"text":"Everything is fresh, best Thai food out of all the Thai restaurants I have been at. The restaurant is too small to eat in, so we always do take out. It's our \"go to\" dinner when I'm too tired to cook"}
{"text":"Great little Thai place. Food was great. Service was friendly and very helpful. It's a little hidden gem in the desert."}
{"text":"Amazing food. We had our staff meeting catered this evening by Ta Lew. It was excellent. Fresh cuisine with amazing flavors."}
{"text":"Little cute Thai restaurant. The space is small and usually busy during dinner time. We were waiting for 20 mins to get a table and 30 45 mins for the food. We had the crab puff which was good as well as beef pad see ew which was little oily but tasty. We tried chicken pineapple fried rice which was great and tasty. We ordered little spicy and it was spicy for us who don't spicy food that often. I'm sure you would like their spicy food if you can handle heat."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in the valley! Good every time and great service too! It gets pretty busy on the weekends, take out orders can take over 45 mins. Not their fault tho, it's just that good!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food in Gilbert!  Always busy and still able to get take out order in 15-20 minutes.  Clean and friendly atmosphere inside restaurant."}
{"text":"Outstanding fresh food at a great price. Front counter is friendly, all around great place. Wish it was a little bigger inside."}
{"text":"So I go in to Ta Lew today at 2:40pm with my kids. The ladies behind the counter start whispering so I ask if there is an issue. She leaves me standing there, goes to the kitchen, and comes back and says that lunch ends at 3, so we can only order takeout.  I would think there is a better way to handle that. Service is definitely lacking."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and everything was really good. The place is a bit small but the presentation and the dishes were all very good. I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now and both times I had the chicken pad thai. The dish is absolutely delicious! I get it hot which gives it a good kick since I love spicy food. Great place and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"WOW, simply WOW! This place is may have the best Thai I have had and that is only after one visit.  I had the pad thai with tofu, the ingrediants were so fresh and crisp.  The staff was so friendly and the atmosphere had a great vibe.  I would normally order yellow curry, went out of my comfort zone and tried their pad thia, after that experience I look forward to tyring other items I have never had.  Their portion sizes are perfect, a little to have the next day to remind you how good it was."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Drunken noodles are awesome and their egg rolls are amazing. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"We are/were regulars here; Thai food is usually good. Don't think we'll trust to-go orders again (if we return at all), at least not w/o inspecting before leaving: Portions were ridiculous, but hey, got plenty of rice though. The couple strands of wilted, black lettuce were disgusting. And the Curry sauce itself barely rose half way in the container. And to think we tipped on this to-go order; insult to injury..."}
{"text":"After a busy day yesterday, all I wanted was Thai food. It was 8:40 and I knew they closed at 9. I called and asked if I could do a pick up order and they happily said yes. I was running a little late, ended up getting there at 9:05. I work in the restaurant business so I know how it feels to have customers come in after hours. Still, they had smiles on their faces and great customer service. Thank you so much, the food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I work in the same plaza as Ta Lew so I always go here for lunch! The lunch special is amazing and the food and service is great!!! 10/10 recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, and the service was great. It's a small place, just a few tables, but it is slammed with to go orders. I had the pad Thai noodles with pork, just the right spice, my wife had pork fried rice, huge portion, and delicious. Servers were friendly and prompt, and don't forget to order a Thai iced tea, some of the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and was extremely impressed with the freshness of the food and the speed at which I was served. I don't like my food too spicy and was given the option, which was great for me. I was greeted with warm hellos and thanked for coming in. I will definitely be coming here regularly. Lots of parking and I loved the patio seating."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are the redemption for this place as both are excellent if you are looking for a \"bistro\" and not formal. However, the styrofoam waitresses could definitely be more helpful/seem to care at all. Prices are a bit steep as well."}
{"text":"Pretty good! 

The wait can take a bit sometimes, but the food is great! My husband is personally a fan of the Red Curry dish and I am more of a Pad Thai person. We have had a few of the appetizers as well, and those were also awesome. This place is definitely one of our new staple food places."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Arizona!! My husband, daughter & I all crave the food from Ta Lew Thai Bistro. It's an intimate restaurant so we feel taken care of. I enjoy the \"cashew nut\" with veggies & chicken with a medium amount of spice & my daughter usually orders the \"pad Thai\" with the next level Arizona spice. Everything is fresh and the taste will bring you back. The restaurant is clean, great pricing and enough food to bring some home. Our server, Markelle, checked on us several times & did a great job. So glad we found this place."}
{"text":"The food was alright compare to other Thai restaurants around the area. The price is a bit high and not worth it. My fiancé and I wanted to try new Thai place so we went there since it's rated really good but ended up very disappointed."}
{"text":"Rave reviews on Yelp and not even 5 minutes from our new digs so of course had to check this place out.  It did not disappoint and it's our go to Thai place now ;-)

The eats: Loved the pad thai, chicken satay, garlic chicken and chicken basil - very flavorful and authentic tasting just like what we had in Thailand!  Good portions though on our second time here we did order extra chicken with the basil chicken because on our first visit there wasn't a lot of chicken with the garlic chicken.  No biggie, could be just us because we're piggies like that.

The spot: Not a huge restaurant but enough, maybe 6-8 tables? It did look like there was a second floor for eating as well.  Seems like a popular spot for takeout especially since you can easily place your order online through their website. 

The service: We got our food to go and no issues with it.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this newer Thai restaurant around the corner from us. So glad we did!! Yummy, fresh, tasty, well seasoned, flavorful Thai food so close to home? Woohoo!!

I got the pad Thai with chicken, flavorful and rich and sweet. I chose the lowest level of spice and it had great flavor and a little kick. 

My husband got the basil chicken and medium spicy (they have 3 levels of spice, instead of 5 which we've seen before) . He was impressed with how hot it was! He is a ghost pepper fan and now dreams of trying the level 3. Eek! Not for me, but he was delighted. The basil chicken is fabulous, fresh peppers and so good! Highly recommend!!

The restaurant is tiny, and will likely have a wait on weekend nights-nothing new for Gilbert! So worth the wait, of take out is really popular too! 
Go check them out! You'll love it!!"}
{"text":"There are not a lot of good Thai places in Arizona. I found this to be one of the best. If you like real spicy ask for their thai hot. It was perfect not only was hot but had great flavor. We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"They only have 8 tables or so, but the food is fantastic! I personally love the basil chicken dish, medium spicy. I like spicy food, this has enough spice to make my mouth water. 

We love to take out of town guests to this restaurant, hope it's around for a long time!"}
{"text":"We love this little bistro! Great service and we love eating the yellow curry and lemongrass soup!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent! The food was delicious! The space is clean, cute, airy, and inviting. This is my new favorite Thai place in Gilbert!!"}
{"text":"Yummy and to the point !  Stuff is pretty spicy here so just ask them if you aren't sure .  Thai coffee is good too !"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and adorable. Great service too! They were very attentive and friendly. The only thing I would say is it was pretty cold inside while we waited for for our food, but we might have been sitting in a draft. And it's not a deal breaker for us. :) We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Yellow curry is sooooooo good! Staff is super friendly as well!! You will definitely become a regular here"}
{"text":"Had lunch here during the week. I got mild chicken pad Thai and a Thai iced tea. The lunch also comes with an egg roll and salad. Food was excellent and service was great."}
{"text":"AmazeBalls!  This place was so good and everything we ordered was spot on. We had 2 Thai food snobs with us and they were blown away by the food. We were greeted and seated promptly and the service was great. For how good this place is there should have been a 45 minute wait, shame on you people of Gilbert. 
To start we ordered the Chicken Satay which was flavorful and moist, and I wanted to start a relationship with the peanut dipping sauce. We split 3 dishes for our entrees, Green Curry, Pineapple Fried Rice and Chicken Pad Thai. I'll build up to my favorite. The Pineapple Fried Rice with Beef was really good. I added a little chili paste for heat but that was a personal preference, not because it needed it. Rice was well cooked, beef was tender and the cashews added great texture. The Pad Thai, which is usually my favorite was very tasty. The noodles were a perfect texture, soft but not mushy and the flavor was out of this world. The winner of the night though was the Green Curry. After the first bite I needed a moment to assess my surroundings and make sure I hadn't died and gone to Green Curry Heaven (it's a place). The chicken was good, the eggplant was soft, bamboo shoots had a nice crunch, but my friends...the secret is in the sauce. The broth was creamy and sweet and spicy and delish!  I put more of the pad Thai on my plate just to sop up the last of the broth. So so good. We finished with the Mango Rice. Rice was warm, sweet and saucy but not too saucy and the mango was cool and 
It was a little too bright inside and the chairs were a kinda flimsy. Do yourself a favor and GO!"}
{"text":"I tried this place after moving away from my favorite Thai place further north. It's very good and flavorful! My only thought is that it's less spicy than average places. I usually do about a 3 in spice level and could do a four here easily so just a heads up!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, price, atmosphere and service.  

The hot Tom Kha  soup was delicious and cleared my friend's sinuses. For the price, the cup is a lot of food.

I enjoyed the cashew vegetable lunch special.  We are definitely coming back here again someday.

The customer service is excellent.
Tenny is smart and funny.  She knows her customers."}
{"text":"I love the yellow curry- best I've found. Clean and great service. I highly recommended! My only suggestion is my preference would be the vegetables in the curry be chopped smaller."}
{"text":"Probably nothing I can say about this place that hasn't been said before. Everything was perfect. The quality, quantity and service was exemplary."}
{"text":"Seriously good Thai!  We discovered Ta Luw through Door Dash and have ordered it a couple times now.  Everything we have ordered (Yellow Curry, Red Curry, Fried Rice, Orange Chicken) has been exceptionally good.  We really like the freshness of every dish - potatoes and carrots are scored, fresh vegetables in the fried rice, etc. The Orange Chicken is a standout, as it tastes like a freshly made sauce, not pre-made and overly sweet, and has a nice kick.  The Yellow Curry is really creamy and yummy.  It is great to have a really good Thai place in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Had the red curry with chicken and yellow curry with tofu. Good flavors although nothing spectacular. Lunch includes small side salad with peanut dressing and a half of an egg roll. Including tip, cost about $25. I question whether the egg roll was homemade because it looked and tasted like those sold from Costco. A bit pricey for quantity so will probably try other places."}
{"text":"Cute little Thai place with patio and upper deck seating.  Portion is huge with a lot of meat in them. Server is attentive. Very reasonable price."}
{"text":"My fav place to pick up TAKE OUT! Yellow curry and Pad Thai are my standard fav's. Yet, I hear the Red curry and Orange chicken are amazing if I could ever stop ordering the yellow curry I may get to try something new.  But no, I can't stop ordering the yellow....b/c it's that good!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place that is quite close to us and order take out last night.  And I'm so happy we did.  It was some of the best Thai we've had in a long time!  The food was fresh and deliciously made.  A 30 minute wait time made me happy, knowing preparation went in to our food.

We ordered the rolls, which were yummy.  The Larb which was served with cut cabbage, I've never had it that way and really liked how light and refreshing it was.  We also ordered beef drunken noodles and Evil Jungle Princess Chicken.  The noodles were out of this world, the best I've ever had.  The Evil Jungle Princess had so much depth and sweetness and it was very very good.  The portion sizes were very generous and we will be enjoying the leftovers for lunch today.

We were so impressed, and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants these days for lunch. I don't eat a lot of meat - my favorite menu items are pad thai and the vegetable medley.  Lunch specials come with a spring roll and salad with an awesome peanut-y dressing. Veggies and other ingredients are always fresh. 

Update: They have strange order-over-the-phone policies and when our family goes in their with little kids, they want to tack on gratuity. Whatever. I would've given a bigger tip so their loss."}
{"text":"I had the Pad See Yew with shrimp and it was pretty good, portion was good too. I won't say it's the best I ever had, but I am very happy that this place is near my house. Would definitely go again, once I try more of their dishes I will update my review."}
{"text":"We love Thai and this place was great, especially the Thai Hot, VERY HOT!  Just the way we like it.  Great flavors.  We got the Yellow Curry w/ Chicken and the Drunken Noodles w/ veggies... both great.  We look forward to trying the other menu options in the future.  Also - good portion sizes, will have plenty of leftovers."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for so long and I wish we had sooner!  
We tried the crab puffs with an amazing sauce, orange chicken is very orange and fresh tasting, and the yellow curry is exactly what you'd expect. We also tried the Thai iced teas which were perfect!
The service was great, all the staff is very friendly, quick to refill drinks and clear plates, no complaints. 
This is definitely a new favorite and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Ta Lew! This is by far my favorite Thai restaurant in the valley! I have tried multiple places and nobody can compete with their prices, food, and service! The restaurant itself can get a little crammed as they do not have a lot of room, but that has never been a real issue. I would highly recommend their crab puffs and cashew nut with chicken! 

I have called to place an order 20 minutes before closing time (I didn't realize they were about to close or I wouldn't have called) and the staff were all more than happy to prepare my order and thank me for my business. If anyone is looking for a delicious Thai dinner, this place is it!"}
{"text":"Lunch service was prompt, food plentiful and tasty. Many gluten free options but the GF order came with an egg roll that wasn't. Most places offer a 1-5 scheme to indicate how much hot pepper flavor to add; here they prepared my request for 2 as \"mild\" but the heat was not perceptible at all. Guess I could have added chili sauce from a counter bottle. Next time I'll ask for \"Noticeably Spicy\"   

Decor is industrial contemporary with stairs to some extra loft seating. Glad to have this spot within walking distance from home and I'll return."}
{"text":"Best orange chicken I've had. Lemongrass soup was wonderful. If they ask you if you want it hot, they mean \"hot!\"  I was at my spicy limit but really liked the flavor. I will order a notch or two less next time. Small restaurant but there is an upstairs. Great, friendly service. I really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Friendly staff excellent service and very clean inside. Small and quiet but not stuffy."}
{"text":"It is so great to have a Thai restaurant in this part of Gilbert! I have had at least six different entrees from ta lew, and they are all top notch!  Current favorites are the yellow curry (best I've had), and the spicy basil, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Very nice owners and good customer service!"}
{"text":"No pad see ew on the lunch menu (my go to dish) so I ended up ordering off the regular menu.  Ordered medium heat which was quite hot for medium, but exactly the heat level I was looking for.  Enough to make me sweat, but not so hot I couldn't taste my food.  Very small place...not seating on the first floor so we sat in the loft area.  Kind of weird way up there....and warm.  Waited a long time for our check so we ended up leaving cash on the table after a rough calculation of what our bill would be.  Might go back if I'm in the area again, but won't make a special trip since there are plenty of other equally good or better Thai place near my house.  Besides, no alcohol = no go for the BF.  He just needs that ice cold beer with his Thai hot dish."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I tried this place! Everything was delicious and they got my mild order perfect, as well as my friend's spicy order. I haven't had an eggroll this good in a long time and the salad with peanut sauce is a perfect side. I love the super simple menu. The staff were professional, tables clean. We had a perfect lunch out on the patio. I really hope they will add some umbrellas so we can continue to eat outside as it warms up. Note that this is a small place, so if you go at a busy time it could be hard to get a table. -Though there were two tables available for a Wednesday lunch, so not bad."}
{"text":"Solidly good Thai food. We are so excited to have a good Thai restaurant nearby! Our first experience was an order of take-out, and we had the red chicken curry (medium), and the chicken pad thai. Both were really good. I thought the chicken in the pad thai was really tender and juicy. 

The staff was very friendly and offered some good recommendations. 

We will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I grew up eating authentic Thai my whole life, which is great but also made me kind of a snob (which isn't as great, haha). So, when I heard this place was moving in within walking distance I was cautiously optimistically; they exceeded my expectations. 
The food was good, the people were nice, and it tasted like they actually understood why ingredients are used unlike some place were they just parrot what they think Thai food should be (looking at you Thai Chili). 
Because of the \"cozy\" size of the restaurant there were a few Thai favorites missing from the menu (notably Tod Mun and Rad Naa), but this allows them specialize in fewer dishes which seems to be working for them! 
Also, they don't seem to take \"spicy\" or \"ped mak\" seriously, so if you're a heat lover like me, you really have to emphasize that (which is counter-intuitive for a lot of Thai food). 
The prices are fair given the area, clocking in about middle-of-the-pack for Thai places in the Valley. 
All in all it's nice that I don't have to cook every time I want Thai food now. :)"}
{"text":"Service was good, but the food was just okay.  The curry came out over salted and the pad thai lacked flavor.  Maybe it was an off day, but I'm not sure if we'll go back."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because we wanted Thai for dinner and it was close to home, nice people, amazing food and fast service. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great little place.  Only 22 sits inside.  Good service. Nice food.
I had the shrimp tum yum soup and it was delicious. 
The crab fried rice was ok, but lacked taste."}
{"text":"We came in and got a nice table up stairs. This is a small venue so large groups of say 6 or more may have a hard time getting a table. We ordered 2 appetizers, the chicken dumplings and the chicken satay. They were really good with the sweet soy sauce. After apps we got 3 dishes to share for the 5 of us and still had left overs. We did the pad see ew with beef, garlic chicken and Mussiman curry. They were all wonderful! We got all three medium heat but for some reason the garlic chicken seemed way hotter then the other so if you don't want to sweat maybe go with a mild or stick with medium. They are really friendly and kept checking on us to make sure everything was great."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Az. Crab puffs are a must, and all the entrees are so good that it makes it hard to choose what to eat. Also, great and friendly staff. :)"}
{"text":"Soooo good! Went during the lunch special and had the Spicy Basil (mild) with chicken. Fantastic recommendation by a very nice waitress. Can't wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review as my will to resist blogging about restaurants failed after eating at Ta Lew this evening. I have now tried over half the menu (apps, soups, entrees, chef specials). At this point, I'm confident that Ta Lew Bistro is best Thai food in Gilbert, AZ. Consistently hot take out with great customer service. I doubt you will find better Thai in the city."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the yellow curry. We ordered it takeout. She had the mild and I had the \"Thai Hot\". We both thought it was really good. Good Thai food isn't always the easiest to find in Arizona. But we'll both be eating here again in the future."}
{"text":"The BEST Thai in the east valley and equal to the best Thai that I've tasted anywhere  else! Pad Thai was delicious and I added fish sauce & thai chili sauce to it to make it even better. Seriously, amazing!"}
{"text":"It's so overpriced. You can get much better quality Thai food at somewhere else with cheaper price. We will never come back again."}
{"text":"Scrumptious Drunken Noodles and Larb! Friendly staff, fast service and reasonably priced.  Can't wait to come back and try the curry. 

Very small and extremely bright dining area (as in wear your sunglasses and spf) or a better option is to get it to go."}
{"text":"Nice tom yum soup more on sour side but good with seafood. Beef dish was average along with green curry chicken.  Not sure why a 4.5 avg score. For Thai pretty average."}
{"text":"We gave this new place (for us) a try kind of late on a Friday evening.  Small dining area down with a few tables upstairs and some outside.  Kind of reminded me of the small places in New York that use every inch of space.  Lovely service from the wait staff.  They were helpful with the menu and answered any questions that we had.  We ordered the Vegetable Medley and Spicy Basil both with chicken.  Both amazing!  The vegetables were not over cooked and maintained their crunch with every bite.  The sauce was light, not thick and overbearing.  In short, the food was fresh and delicious.  There were several \"to go\" customers during our dining time which gave a bustling atmosphere.  Before we left we had the opportunity to meet the owners (who were just as charming as the wait staff) and let them know how much we enjoyed the meal.  All in all, we loved this place!  Right now we live a distance from this cute little place, but we will soon be moving very close, so I am sure it will become a neighborhood favorite for us.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"our new favorite! we have been here 5 times and all experiences have been good. great good and service at a reasonable price! plus the decor is clean and hip :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food, and Tenny the owner is so sweet! My husband loves the yellow curry, and I love the red."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! Everything we have tried there was exceptionally good. We have tried, Cashew Chicken, Drunken Noodles, Orange Chicken, Yellow and Red Curry. Oh, and my husband loves the crab puffs. The staff are always busy, yet, always make it a point to be very  accommodating."}
{"text":"Very great place, food is awesome and so is staff. I used to think Thai Chilli was the best but now hands down this takes the crown, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is great. Generous portions on the dinner menu.  Great area and a nice little restaurant."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant! Good is great - portions are good sized. 

You can tell everything is made fresh!

Love the Thom Kha soup, Orange Chicken and Pad See Ew"}
{"text":"Cashew Nut Chicken is the BEST! This place always cooks up the most fresh, consistently well spiced Thai food. Having tried Thai food all over the world I really cannot say I've had any better than what the cook here can whip up."}
{"text":"Usually I always get Thai curry at a Thai restaurant, but this time I decided on Pad Thai and I wasn't disappointed, not really stunned but probably will be back. 
The Pad Thai was good, would have wanted more vegetables but well, I always complain about not enough vegetables. First bites were kind of bland but it developed more flavor the more I ate. 
I also got crab puffs which were really good, crispy wonton and a juicy filling of I guess mayonnaise and crab meat. They increased the stars from three to four.
My fiance had chicken fried rice and basil beef. The fried rice was a tad too mushy but had a nice flavor, the basil beef was very delicious but way too many bamboo shots for my taste. I saw other people here rave about it though!
We ordered take out and it was ready in 15 minutes, and the girls at the counter were really friendly! 
So it's definitely worth another try for me."}
{"text":"The food was great and fresh!! We ordered orange chicken and pad Thai. Best Thai food that I've tasted so far that's close to where we live. Will definitely come back again and try their curry!"}
{"text":"My husband picked me up some takeout after a recent surgery from here. I ordered Green Curry with chicken, which is my go-to Thai order. You can always tell how good a Thai place is by their curries!

The curry itself was average. It was good, but not amazing. The prices, on the other hand, are really steep. If the food and/or the style of the restaurant justify higher prices that's one thing, but this place is a run of the mill, strip mall Thai restaurant.

There are plenty of other Thai restaurants as close as this one with better, cheaper food. With that said, I won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"First time here!! I came with my wife and we were a little skeptical since its new to the area but man this place blew my mind!!! I got the yellow curry and my wife got the sweet and sour and they both were out standing!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place as a recommendation; was not disappointed! Red curry was excellent, and the side salad with peanut sauce was excellent."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is outstanding and the service is great! I discovered it this week and have been twice already."}
{"text":"Went with my family for our Monday night dinner and sat in the upstairs loft looking over the rest of the restaurant. We decided to share a few meals between the 5 of us. It was so hard to choose what to get. we shared a couple of appetizers as well. We got ours medium spicy and one was very spicy! But the other two we think we wanted a little spicier, so be sure to ask if the spice varies by the meals. The waitress was extremely nice and we felt very welcome. I will definitely come back if I'm craving Thai food!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that there is a Thai restaurant so close to home!  It's great food, Pad Thai, Green Curry, Spicy Basil all the bases are covered and made well.  The owner is very friendly and accommodating.  Even though the space is small, it's a great restaurant none the less and the food is what will keep me coming back. 

I typically ask for my dishes to be \"Thai hot\" and it never seems to be as spicy as when I'm in Thailand.  This place is no different, the spiciest still isn't so spicy I can't enjoy the food.  I hope they will be around for a while!"}
{"text":"This hole in the wall Thai restaurant is a gem! It is operated by a family from Thailand. The food is amazing! We had a group of five, one of whom lived in Thailand. Everyone was very please with what they had. This is probably the best oriental type food I've had in years. The spices are not too hot, but you are offered 1, 2 or 3 peppers of spiciness. I cautiously had one pepper, but could have easily had two. Not to be missed."}
{"text":"I think we just found our new lunch/work spot! The food is unbelievable! The service was great & now we will have enough for left overs! Yummy"}
{"text":"First time trying Ta Lew Thai Bistro... And it was great.
Not a big dining area so the fact that I was ordering takeout was perfect. 
The pad see ew chicken was really good. I got the medium (spiciness) and definitely could've went up a notch. The veggie rolls were excellent...
The dinner portion easily feeds two people.
I will be back.
Mmmmmmm, try this place, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Terrible food.  Pad Thai tastes like it was made with watered down ketchup and sugar, vegetables are so over cooked that they are deteriorating. The green curry is watery and the vegetables are brownish grey and horribly over cooked.  I don't recommend this food for anyone!"}
{"text":"Love Thai food so thought we would try Ta Lew. We were seated promptly however they were out of diet drinks. No biggie. The food was good quality. We had lunch. The service was not good however. They even turned away a family of four who came in ten minutes until 3 stating they were closing and could not take them in the resturant. Over all good quality food. But service is needs help."}
{"text":"I was excited about this new addition to the neighborhood but very disappointed after trying it out:( I got the green curry and it was flavorless ,my rice  was really  dry and it wasn't cooked right . Since they are new I will give it an another try and hopefully my experience will be better next time around ."}
{"text":"Decided to check out the new Thai place in Gilbert. Located right by Agritopia, Talew Thai has limited spacing but uses it wisely with a second floor and patio providing additional seating. Would not recommend for large group if you're planning on eating in but thoroughly enjoyed visiting with my daughter tonight. She had the chicken dumplings and I had the Pad Woon Sen. Both were delicious but the latter was just a little too salty and too slimy. I will admit that I am a pad woon sen snob, though, so I'm bumping up the original 3 star to 4 stars. Portions were generous and the service was excellent. Thai tea was great and free with a Yelp check in. I will definitely be returning to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"The best tom ka soup I've ever had! Had mine with chicken. That and  a sweet thai tea ... yum. The owners are so nice. I love supporting this local non-chain biz."}
{"text":"Ta Lew has THE BEST Thai tea. Nowhere else in the valley does it right. Sooo good! They don't mess with their spicy factor- it's spicy and perfect!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! I am definitely a Thai food enthusiast and have eaten at too many restaurants to name. But this Thai restaurant is outstanding. We had the tom kah soup, and the green curry. OMGsh, the curry is absolutely the best I have ever had. We drive from the west valley to eat here and it's totally worth it. Everything is fresh and delicious. This is the BEST Thai restaurant I have been to. Tenny is fantastic and so knowledgeable about the menu and the food. Amazing experience. The portions were really big and the Thai iced tea is twice the amount I usually get at other restaurants."}
{"text":"This was some of the best Thai food I have ever had! The tom kha soup was absolutely amazing! It was an assault on my taste buds in a great way! The pineapple curry fried rice was amazing as well! You absolutely will not be disappointed with the food here. The service was great too! Do your taste buds a favor and eat here!"}
{"text":"Really good service, fast and tasty! Great lunch spot. I had curry. Will go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall location with amazing Thai food. My go to entree is usually the pad thai with beef! The employees are all very friendly. The restaurant is really small (maybe 5 tables total?) so I usually get my food to go."}
{"text":"We had their lunch special!!
It was delicious and very reasonably priced.
It is a cute little Thai restaurant and I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Love Thai food and we do not have many in Gilbert.  I have lived in Chicago and we have thai places everywhere.  Happen to come across this while shopping and took order to go.  It was the best Laab Gai salad I have ever had or very close.
I ordered it hot and it could have been a bit hotter but no complaints!  Loaded with cilantro which I love and it was a large portion too.  Fair price for portion size.  Small space but that's just what it is and can deal with it.  I probably will carry out most often.  It was very busy and happy to see that.  
I hope they can expand with wine on the menu and fresh spring rolls too.
Will return.  Only waited 10 minutes for an order togo.  Will be back and recommend."}
{"text":"Best thai food my wife and I had in a long time. Dishes had complex tastes very well put together. If you like spicey order medium hot and you'll get the desired fire in the hole. Spicey basil, beef panang, pineapple fried rice with vegetable, and crab puffs were all excellently prepared with fresh quality ingredients. Touchdown baby!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out.... the food is very good, ordered pad Thai....delicious!!
Ladies at the front counter were very kind and helpful.  (I'm disabled and the 1 lady took my order out to my car, not everyone offers!). I will go again next time I'm in Gilbert. I"}
{"text":"My husband picked up some take out from this place and I have to say that I'm soooo glad I have an awesome asian place across the street from where I live!! 

We had the yellow curry with mixed seafood, vegetable fried rice, orange chicken & crab puffs.

PROS:

Everything tasted FANTASTIC! I just came from a trip from Las Vegas where I just had the most fantastic thai food and was craving for more like crazy! With this place opening up just minutes from my door I felt like my dreams were answered! 

The yellow curry tasted just like the kind my mom used to make when I was growing up so I felt like I was instantly transported back to a happy place =) Savory with just a tiny hint of spice, great portions & I felt like I nearly wanted to drink the curry sauce with a straw LoL.

The vegetable fried rice was great. The vegetables were fresh and incorporated the flavor of the fried rice so well, I probably could have just eaten that and been already satisfied.

Orange chicken =  done right! So many places heavily dredge chicken with so much breading  I end up wondering if there's any chicken in it. Here, the breading is light and I can taste & see the fresh taste of orange rind in the sauce. THANK YOU!

The same with the crab puffs. Finally actual crab and not just a bunch of mushy cheese inside!

Now, I can't be all roses and rainbows, otherwise this place would have 5 stars. Every restaurant has a couple of flaws and hopefully the next time I return with these changes amended I can give a full 5 stars (I hate to do this since the food is sooooo good & they just opened).

CONS:

The yellow curry had a wonderful mix of big chunks of fish & shrimp so why ruin it by putting imitation crab in it? I would rather have no crab than have the fake stuff. I ended up picking it out and throwing it away, they were just taking up space. Though the scallops tasted great and absorbed the flavor of the curry well, they were so small they reminded me of cereal puffs. Yes, I ate them LoL. However I would rather have one big piece of scallop than a bunch of small mini ones.

I'm unsure if the chef had a one time mishap and was in a hurry when adding onions to the fried rice & yellow curry. One could definitely tell the most outside part of the onion was used (where it is dry and hard) so was difficult to consume. I also ended up picking those FEW pieces out.

The crab puffs were slightly overdone on the edges, but again, my family still consumed them. LoL

Like I said, overall 4 stars. This place is a great place and sooooo thankful to happen in this part of Gilbert. I'll definitely be getting food from here again and again and hoping those few cons I mentioned can be considered by their management. Once it does (and they incorporate delivery) I'll give them a concrete 5 stars!

Oh and btw, I had the most fantastic dungeness crab fried rice in this thai place in vegas. If that could be added to the menu, I would probably write yelp to add the option of rating a bizillion stars....LoL"}
{"text":"This is great Thai food, at a reasonable price and good portion sizes.  I have never eaten inside, only take out but my family loves it."}
{"text":"Wow. We loved this place. Came and got our usual of Larb, (Thai hot for him) Pad Thai, and yellow curry. SO GOOD! This is our new go to!! 
Service was great, my water was kept topped off. 
Love the location, the owner is lovely in every way! 
Go here for some of the BEST Thai food!"}
{"text":"It's been a year since I reviewed here last. Still bringing amazing food. Lunch specials are great! Thai tea is still delicious!"}
{"text":"We order out here at least once a week. I would love to try other items on the menu but the yellow curry is just too good to pass up!"}
{"text":"The best Thai restaurant I have been to in AZ! I had the pad Thai for lunch and it was amazing! Can't wait to come back and try the drunken noodles for dinner"}
{"text":"The egg rolls are thin and crispy, as they should be. Garlic chicken and pad thai and pad see ew are outstanding. The Thai iced tea gives a great jolt of energy and deliciousness. I will forgive them for serving Pepsi products, because the service and food are that good. ;)"}
{"text":"My family does Thai food Tuesday because we love this place so much! I'm obsessed with the Red Curry and Sticky Rice with Mango. Everything we have had has been super awesome, Evil Jungle Princess, Pad Thai, Green Curry, Tom Kha soup, it's all super good. I like the medium spiciness!!"}
{"text":"Great THAI FOOD ! 

Really happy this is in the area , it needed it ! 

Will be ordering regularly : )"}
{"text":"Got take out and it was delicious. Garlic chicken, green curry and pad Thai and fried rice for the kids. Medium is pretty spicy. Love when places have brown rice."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I ordered the Pad Thai lunch special and was surprised with how much food you get! Everything was delicious. I really enjoyed the peanut sauce used for the salad! I also tried the Thai tea. That stuff is amazing! If I lived closer I would be here all the time. Plus, this place has incredible customer service. I can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food, and the quick service.  We tried a soup, an appetizer, and a couple entrees.  We'll definitely we back."}
{"text":"We love this little neighborhood thai joint.  The pad thai, yellow curry, and pork fried rice are our faves. The pork fried rice is so light, fluffy and flavorful.  Unlike others, we weren't blown away by the orange chicken. It was good but a little too chewy.  We always get it to-go on our way home from work and they do a nice job packaging everything so that there are no leaks and everything stays hot."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in the area, hands down.   Not because they have great food but the service is excellent!   I've been here twice now and they have catered to my every need.  Normally go here with Camaron so we eat our dishes vegan style.  Which they have no problem doing and it's AWESOME!   My hats off to the chef and also to Camille, Jojo and Gift for being so friendly and making sure my visit was good."}
{"text":"Can't say it enough...the food always has great Flavors!!! Tonight we had Panang Curry, Spicy Basil w/Chicken and Salmon w/ House Sauce. Delicious!!! Friendly staff as well...but a bit too chatty this evening."}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from my neighborhood and it had excellent reviews, so I was super excited to try their cuisine. 
I ordered the Pad Thai and the Tom Yum soup and was thoroughly disappointed. The Pad Thai noodles were cooked into a block that was difficult to pick apart with my fork and the flavor was bitter and sweet. I ended up only eating about a fourth of my plate because the taste was so overwhelming. The Tom Yum soup unfortunately followed suit, it was too sweet and the flavor just wasn't good. 
I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Wonderful chicken pad Thai. The side salad has a great dressing. I just loved it. The orange chicken was just Devine with a light batter on it, not the thick stuff  we will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai iced tea! As far as food, I've tried the eggplant and tofu, pineapple chicken fried rice, and chicken potstickers. Everything is consistently delicious and the servers are helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Love me some Ta Lew. Always excellent service! The food is so good, the first time I tried it, I went back the second day! Tenney is super sweet, and always remembers you, making you feel special! I love that it is family owned and operated!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with our visit because it did not match our expectations based on the previous reviews on yelp. :(

My boyfriend and I love thai food but the food we got from here was just meh.

The crab Rangoons were a little over done and tasted like oil. The oil taste made them unappetizing. 

The pineapple fried rice was okay, but the curry flavor was too strong.  I think the fried rice could have been better without as much of the seasoning. I thought the curry component would be a little more mild but it took over the whole dish. 

Pad See Ew is one of my favorite dishes and I was disappointed that the noodles were very oily/greasy. 

Overall the food was underwhelming, but maybe we just came on a bad day. It was very busy and we could tell that the kitchen was having a very hard time keeping up with all of the dine-in and takeout orders."}
{"text":"I lived in NYC for a number of years, and I admit, I was very spoiled when it came to Thai food. I am SO HAPPY to see that I can have a consistently excellent Thai bistro experience here, as it was one of the things I thought I'd just have to miss when I moved away from the city. Every dish is fantastic, and they even accommodated a special request for something that wasn't on the menu. I've brought other ex-pats with me, and they've raved too."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food and the spice is right on!  Friendly service and fresh ingredients, will be back!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai was okay. Seemed a bit watery to me. Service was okay but not great. Need a better lunch option. There are no specials on the weekend. $11 for a to-go lunch is a bit pricey. Can get same for $8 at Thai Chili 2 Go."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Thai food restaurant in the valley. My wife says it's the best Pad Thai with chicken she's ever had. I'v had the red, green, and yellow curry and they all tasted GREAT. They have fast and very friendly customer service. Always a great experience!"}
{"text":"Looking for decent Thai food and happened to find this place on Yelp. We were seated upstairs and, while there was nothing wrong with the food, it was a little on the bland side, not the great flavor you expect from Thai food. We had Thom Kha soup with chicken and the Drunken Noodles, medium spicy."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but not all that tasty.  The curry did not seem to have a lot of curry in it.  The Thai iced tea was just ok.  We will likely try it again in the future to give the place another shot.  Based on the other reviews, we are hoping it was just a bad night."}
{"text":"This place is just a small restaurant, nothing fancy but the food is amazing!!  And you have to order their Thai Tea. It is the best I have ever had. The only thing that could make it better would be if they had boba!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I moved close to this establishment a few months ago. While we can still travel to our favorite Thai restaurant, we wanted to have a local one in case we didn't want to make the whopping 20-minute drive. I know. Weird, right?  

We've been to this place three times. The first time, we went with two other friends. Let me say that the place is....cozy, but it feature a really cool loft for more seating. They also have your typical levels of Thai spiciness:  mild, medium, hot, Thai hot, and a new one for me - crazy Thai hot. With our experience at other Thai restaurants, most of the time, the Thai hot isn't, well, hot. It's more of a mild bordering medium (but that's what happens when restaurants rely solely on dry spices and not fresh ones). 

Well - this place proved us wrong.  They rely on dry AND fresh Thai spices - just the way it ought to be. And a word of caution:  their Thai spice is nothing like the other Thai places here: they're generally hotter. Perfect example:  a medium here would be a hot, bordering Thai hot at other places. Want to know what the crazy Thai hot is?  Try it. You must. At least once like we did. ;)

As for the food - it's delicious and reasonably priced. We even met the owners - super nice people. Their Thai tea is wonderful, and I like their pad Thai and spicy noodles."}
{"text":"We have ordered food here twice now and both times the food was delicious. The food tastes fresh and I love the spices they use. The spicy basil is so good with the perfect amount of heat. Oh and I also loved their thai iced tea."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for curry. The limited menu makes choosing easy. The pad Thai is also delicious. Limited seating, but take-out is good. The lunch special is a great deal."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and 5 stars both times.  Have had drunken noodles with chicken and red curry with chicken.  Both excellent!!!   Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place.  Food was good but we waited over 30 minutes for our order in a restaurant that only has like 5 or 6 tables.  We watched 3 different people walk in & order to go.  They got their food before us.  Kind of shows a warped priority, like we were already there and 'hostages' because we couldn't really walk out.
My drunken noodles were tasty but came to the table pretty much cold.  My husband's mixed seafood spicy basil serving was very small too.
Probably won't go back because of service and wait time.  Thai Chili is still a better option."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here, or had take-out, multiple times and it has never disappointed. According to the owner, the food may seem to take a little longer to come out, but that's because each and every order is made fresh. I'm no food connoisseur, but we do eat Thai food anytime we have the chance, and Ta Lew does produce some of the freshest and best tasting food around.

There are not a ton of tables, so you may need to wait, but it will be worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic. The ONLY Thai restaurant you need to visit in Gilbert. 

Delicious Chicken Satay and the Red Curry was perfection. 

A regular feature on our #deliciousgilbert tours."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new Thai place and ventured out to Ta Lew Thai for the fiancés birthday. Food was fresh, aromatic and delicious! Decor is cute & cozy, I loved the lofted seating area! Service was friendly, prompt and very accommodating. 

We enjoyed the spring rolls, green curry with veggies and Evil Jungle Princess. Everything was phenomenal and very generous in the portion sizes. Spice scale is on point too!!

We ordered the coconut pineapple ice cream for birthday dessert- it was sooo good! Dangerous to know this place is on my way home from work! We will definitely be back. Thank you Ta Lew Thai for an amazing birthday dinner and lovely meal!!!"}
{"text":"The drunken noodles were overall good. They were slightly dry compared to what I am used to, but the flavor was there. The spice level wasn't quite up to the level I had hoped, but maybe I will go with Thai hot next time. Overall, I am very pleased."}
{"text":"I've had some good Thai food all across the country but I've found a true gem here!  The Pad Thai was excellent, the soup had just the right amount of ginger and the service...  My \"go to\" place for Thai now."}
{"text":"So happy to see a Thai place close to home. Been there twice now and both times, food was excellent. Generous portions and great service. Look forward to eating there often.."}
{"text":"Some of the best curries I've ever had!! Large portions. Everything is fresh. It's very clean. Very friendly staff. They have a great take out!"}
{"text":"I stopped here because it's right by one of by dog sitting houses and I'm always searching for food over there!  This place was fantastic I ordered a lunch special that had basil in the name, I'm not sure what all was in my meal besides beef but even though it was really spicy, it was delicious and I could taste all the layers of the flavor.  I was highly impressed and plan on eating there more often!  The springroll was fantastic as was the peanut sauce it came in!"}
{"text":"This Thai spot opened up by my house and its the best thai food on this side of town. I have been there a few times now, I've had the pad thai, yellow curry and pad woon sen. All of them were good, I get mine the hottest I can get it. I just wish it was a little more spicy. So if you are looking for some bomb thai food, I would definitely give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Went out looking for good pad thai for lunch and found it here. It's a small place, but it was perfect. The woman who was working the front was attentive and polite, food was done quickly, and lunch was reasonably priced...two lunches (main dish, salad, and an egg roll) and a drink for under $20. Everything was fresh and delicious, and the spice level was perfect! Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant.We went right at 5pm and sat down right away. Cute little place. Service was excellent! The girls were really attentive. Food was excellent as well. Had the shrimp Pad Thai and sweet and sour chicken. Was well enough for my husband and I. We also ordered their spring rolls and cup of Tom Yum soup. Everything was so delicious! First time my husband had Thai food and was blown away. Ordered our son steamed rice and chicken. He ate everything!! Can't wait to go back!"}
