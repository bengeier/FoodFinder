{"text":"Best fish pakoras in Montreal!  The delivery is very fast. The paneer plates and biryani are great to!"}
{"text":"I ordered in delivery from here yesterday. I found the staff on the phone and the delivery person super friendly and helpful, but I found the pizza underwhelming. 

The crust was ok, better than the cardboard of a Pizza Pizza say, nice crunch on the bottom, but the flavours of the toppings were pretty flat. We had one meat lovers (which seemed to be basically just low quality pepperoni, maybe some other meat in there but nothing noticeable) and one vegetarian palak paneer pizza with spinach, cottage cheese, and onions. We were excited about that one but again, pretty tasteless. Even the cheese was kind of tasteless, like you know the taste of inexpensive low fat cheese? Like that. 

Maybe we just had it on a bad day or ordered the wrong thing, other folks I know who have good taste really like this place, but last night anyway we kind of wished we'd ordered from somewhere else."}
{"text":"ok so a lot of people were telling how great that place was so my friend and i decided to give it a try an well.. what can i say, it was very big mistake. prices very good, staff very friendly on phone but taste very bad also no sauce.  we also got chicken wings and they gave us 8 instead of 10 (thats ok i didnt really care i wasnt gonna call them just to have them bring me 2 chicken wings) anyway it sucks cause this place is super close from where i live but honestly, the crust is so dry oh god i dont even want to think about it! ok thats all."}
