{"text":"What a great place! Discovered an unexpected culinary treat and a healthy economical choice to boot."}
{"text":"Worst meal I've had all year.  Skip this place and just go to the pollo loco across the parking lot.  The chicken was so dry it was almost powdery.  The veges looked gross, the sauces were tasteless.  The guys behind the counter sure meant well but they literally advised us that though their salmon is wild, they're \"switching soon to farmed as it is actually better for you because you know what they eat (monsanto food pellets with red#5 to get just the right flesh tone) and the wild salmon eat all the polluted food in the ocean\".  Then went on to say that the Chinese herbal tea was caffeinated but the Organic Green Tea was not.  No chance any of the four of us in my group will ever go back."}
{"text":"GreenBing opened mid-March 2018. Noticed LomiPoki when I was ordering at the fabulous Thai House. GreenBing shares the same space as LomiPoki. MeiWei Noodles will be opening soon next to where orders for JianBing or rice bowls are ordered. The Veggies Bing Regular is large enough to be shared. Selections range from avocado to corn kernels and peas & carrots. The JianBing wrap with egg, scallions and sesame seeds is generous. I added Sriracha hot chili sauce for extra flavor. Soy sauce is available too. Protein- grilled chicken, grilled steak or organic tofu along with veggie. There's a basic JianBing option too.  I've eaten similar in Taichung, Taiwan though I don't recall seeing JianBing during my travels to Shanghai and Beijing, China.  Some may not like this type of"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on a Saturday, there were several other people here but it wasn't busy, no long wait. The food is DELICIOUS! We ordered the veggie Bing, it was so large that we shared it as our meal. The veggies were fresh and portion was generous. It came with a teriyaki sauce and we added some chili sauce for some extra spice. The interior of the restaurant is clean, modern, and comfortable. We might be back for dinner tonight we liked it so much!"}
{"text":"Great new place that just opened. Very friendly and personalable staff. Two different options of food choice, a Poke (raw fish) and Bing (chckn&steak) side. Clean and friendly environment!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  It shares a space with Lomi Poki so I don't think it gets as many reviews as it should.  Everything is made by hand here.  Your \"burrito\" is a crepe they make in front of you!  Everything is fresh and the portion sizes are great.  They have seafood as well as chicken and steak so there is something for everyone.  The staff is really friendly as well.  I hope more people find this place!"}
{"text":"The best part of Green Bing is watching them prepare your food. The crepe is made on top of hot stone in a circular shape and an egg is cracked on top and spread out. Then your stuffing is added.   We chose their traditional style which had green onions, sesame seeds, Romain lettuce, and wonton crisps. They also added hoisin sauce for flavor. However, this dish reminded me of mushu pork probably because the hoisin sauce. Everything including the lettuce, egg, and crepe was fresh and tasty but the hoisin seemed really out of place. I am looking forward to trying their meat fillings next time."}
{"text":"Theres finally somewhere close to me with a sushi burrito! Lol I have been wanting to try one forever and this one didn't disappoint. My boyfriend and I both loved it. I got shrimp with the spicy house sauce, crab, avocado and some other things! The workers were both also very helpful. Since I havent been there before I walked in looking a bit confused but they instantly helped me out!! Price was fair too, coming from a college kid ;) Will be recommending to my family and friends. Thanks!!"}
