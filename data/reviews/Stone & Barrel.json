{"text":"Lovely views and great music and dancing. The food was so so . Prices are good at happy hour!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at the S & B for the second time. Compared to the old restaurant, this one is a huge departure and improvement. The service is spot on, the food is excellent and the price is right. However, last night's experience was a little less positive than our first visit. It was crazy busy. While we waited to be seated we were front and centre spectators of a very unhappy customer who ranted and raved and even yelled at the person trying to deal with the problem. This happened smack-dab in the middle of the traffic flow and should have been taken to a private area. Once seated, I had the prime rib sandwich and my husband had the fish and chips. My horseradish sauce , as well as my husband's tartar sauce was actually sour cream. Although my husband was able to finally get the tartar sauce, I was given, first tartar sauce, then another container of sour cream and told it was, indeed, horseradish sauce, made from scratch. It was sour cream!! After that, the server chose to ignore the issue and I never did get horseradish sauce.  Maybe they were saving the horseradish sauce for the next night- prime rib night. It was no big deal, but I did not appreciate the ruse."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say! I grew up in the restaurant business and have done everything from wait tables, to bartend and have worked at five star, five diamond Relais and Chateaux properties. I have lived in the area for 14 years and have actually eaten here before is was Stone & Barrel. The facility has always been really nice but the food was always just average. This new place, Stone & Barrel, is amazing!!! They remodeled the entire clubhouse and the layout is inviting and lively. The bar area is very cool and did an amazing job with the decor. The food on the other hand blows it all away! The chef is obviously very good at what she does and you can tell by how she blends flavors. I saw a review about the shrimp cocktail and how they did not get a cocktail fork lol...Well, this was by far one of the best shrimp cocktails I have ever had. It comes with four shrimp, lump crab meat, a layer of mini shrimp, fresh shredded cabbage, killer cocktail sauce (I usually have to add horseradish to get it spicy, but this was perfect just the way it was served) with pieces of fresh cilantro mixed in. The way the tangy cocktail sauce, blended with the ocean taste of the seafood and the cilantro with the spice was incredible! You really have to try it to understand what I mean. The flavors all worked and went extremely well together. Mix in few small bites of lump crab meat and it was heavenly. I can't wait to go back to try the burger, prime rib and maybe every dish they have! I did try one of their wood fired pizza, classic white, and it was one of the best pizzas I have ever had. The crust was crunchy and thin, but soft and chewy inside. I could have eaten the crust by itself it was so tasty. I also got to try my wife's Braised Short rib Tacos which were absolutely delicious. They come with a side of beans that are incredible! The price for what you get with every dish is on point. I am sure a lot of people state the same, but I am extremely picky and also have had the opportunity to both eat and work in some of the finest restaurants in the country. Stone & Barrel in Sun Lakes is quite the hidden gem. Tara was our server and did a fantastic job. Again, my compliments to the Chef, she is obviously very creative, talented and has an excellent palate. Can't wait to try another dish on the menu!"}
{"text":"Who knew a restaurant in a retirement community open to the public would be so great! Had a nice glass of sangria and enjoyed the scenery. Then had the Millionaire Burger!! Omg so delicious! Bacon was crisp and props to the chef for making a well done burger so juicy!! (I like my burgers well done). They had a live band playing Friday night when I went with dancing. Very fun to watch. Will be going back for their pizza! They do one of those hot wood burning domes ovens. Very lively and fun."}
{"text":"I went to dinner with 7 friends.  We had a reservation and were seated immediately. Ben our server was there to take our drink orders. We shared a couple of quesadillas which were excellent and more than enough. One would make a nice meal. Two of our party had the fish & chips which are made using mahi mahi and were not overly breaded. Very good and the portions are very ample. I had the chicken and pasta in a pesto sauce. Nice portion and good taste. Others had hamburgers which they enjoyed. Shared desserts which were delicious.  Services was excellent and attentive. The only issue is the noise level in the bar area. Prices are very reasonable. A great improvement over previous restaurant that was here."}
{"text":"First, I want to state that any reviews that predate November, 2016, are for the previous incarnation called Sunsets.It has been demolished and rebuilt as Stone and Barrel. EVERYTHING in the new facility is completely different.  Went for breakfast today, and had pancakes and sausage and it was great. The coffee was very good and the service was great and done with a smile. The prices are good, so I don't know why the rating is 3 $$$, when it should be 2 $$. This was the THIRD visit and it was positive every time."}
{"text":"Man-O-Man! What a find, this restaurant is the BEST. Been here for breakfast, lunch, dinner, brunch, & happy hour. Beats all others hands down. Foolish not to come here & try it out. There is truly no comparison in Chandler! We eat out normally 5 nights a week & have tried out MANY other restaurants; This place gets a Blue Ribbon every time. Foolish to spend your money anywhere else. This place has the BEST breakfast in town & the service is prompt & very professional. You won't walk away hungry. Hot tip...enter from Riggs Road & be greeted by the friendly gate attendant. Got to go; time to EAT again!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the changes. Vibrant and lively, which was the exact opposite of what existed before. Hadn't been in for dinner for five years. Love the bar setting and the bartenders are wonderful. We had the bacon bbq cheeseburger and the basil chicken pasta. Burger was huge, perfectly grilled and a large side of fries. We took half of the pasta home and my wife and I will probably fight over who gets the leftovers. Dining room looks nice as well and will have to try the wood fired pizza oven next time were in."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in the Oakwood community of Sun Lakes.  Oh my!  What an upgrade from the previous restaurant that occupied this space.  Everything is new.  From the decor, to the menu to the staff.  We took friends for a birthday and we were all very pleased.  We were seated promptly by the hostess.  Our waiter took our drink order promptly.  He was able to answer all of our questions concerning items on the menu.  Our appetizer was served promptly and it was delicious.  We all order something different and everyone was very pleased.  The menu has something for everyone and the prices are very fair.  The Executive Chef had a high profile in the dining room and I consider that a positive.  He stopped by our table seeking our feedback from us.  We have been back twice since our initial visit and received the same excellent food and service.  I highly recommend you stop by and give them a chance."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Not a good bartender. Can't make a good Manhattan. Send it back and got the same back!"}
{"text":"Would be great if they didn't push out smaller reservations on the patio in favor of larger, higher paying parties. Was specific on the phone that we be by the propane fireplaces outside by sunset. Has happened twice. Foods better when you aren't being shoved into the corner."}
{"text":"10 minutes to have someone take your order? 15 minutes to get your food? 20 Minutes to get your check? Ridiculous! The food is very good and the menu is very creative but one server ruined our experience. Tables all around us ordered, ate, paid and left while we were ignored. No, we weren't rowdy or rude."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! What a surprise! The menus is great, caution, the sandwiches are enormous!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I come here almost Saturday with my family. I personally love the pretzels and get them all the time but their pizza is also amazing! They have live music every time we go and happy hour. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Horrible. We chose this country club restaurant based on the map showing it was located on Riggs Road, were looking for an early lunch before a meeting yesterday. We followed the map but found no restaurant, instead gates monitored by security guard. After registering, we followed a winding road with poor/non-existent signage fairly deep into the country club grounds until we arrived at the clubhouse, which contains the restaurant (interior signage only).  We sat a few minutes before noon in a mostly empty restaurant, maybe three other tables occupied. Waited 10 minutes for a server to take our drink and lunch order. Server was helpful and pleasant and apologized for the wait.  I ordered salad and an appetizer, companion ordered blackened mahi mahi sandwich. Then we enjoyed the view from our booth....for nearly 50 minutes. In the interim, we saw our server once, when she brought a new refill for my companion and refilled my glass with water (except I wasn't drinking water...club soda). When our food arrived, mine was great. My companion's asparagus fries, which he ordered with his sandwich, were delicious. But he received no sandwich. On his plate were three soft tacos filled with white fish of some type that had been coated in reddish seasoning, and topped with some type of thousand-island-colored sauce. The rest of the plate was bare. We knew this wasn't what he'd ordered but because of our meeting coming up imminently, we just started scarfing it down.  As we finished, maybe five minutes later (now a few minutes past noon), the restaurant was still empty but a small trickle of guests was beginning to arrive. We looked around for our server, to no avail. Several minutes later she appeared behind the bar, so my companion walked up to request our check and a box for the remaining food I hadn't had time to eat.  Our server came back to the table with the check, but forgot the box, left again, and finally  came back with it.  Terrible service. Took about an hour and 20 minutes for a simple lunch in an empty restaurant. But that's not the worst part.  This morning, I heard from my lunch companion that several hours later, he began to feel sick. Skipped dinner last night bc he was nauseated and had indigestion. Overnight, he was sick from both ends, and today, he's home from work bc he can't keep anything inside.  I can't say for sure that his mystery fish tacos were the culprit, but the experience was bad enough for me not to take the chance again. Map misrepresentation, shoddy service, not at all a customer-friendly experience. Wish we'd gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"I really want to like this restaurant. The patio is beautiful and it's tucked away in the clubhouse of a retired living community. I'll preface the rest of this review by saying that I believe (hope) that our issues were due to a lack of server training and a fairly unmotivated server who I won't name.   We ordered an appetizer that never came. A food runner brought our entrees and our server never came back to check on us so we flagged down a busser, who was very apologetic and kind. I also let her know that I received the wrong kind fries from what I had ordered. She returned a few minutes later with an order of the correct fries. Finally, our server came over with another order of the fries and hurriedly took them away when we let her know that we had just gotten some from the busser. She half heartedly apologized and rushed away. Our drinks happened to be empty by that time and she never asked us if we wanted refills or refilled our water. We had to wave down another busser who brought us more water. The manager made his way over and apologized for the lack of appetizer, I informed him about the mistake with the fries and he offered to buy us dessert.   A little while later I saw that a fly had landed in my water and was floating in it. It took another 15 minutes or so until I could wave over our server as she rushed by us. I showed her the dead fly in my drink and she laughed and returned with a new water glass for me, LEAVING THE GLASS WITH THE DEAD FLY IN FRONT OF ME!   We finally ordered dessert, which took 20 minutes to arrive. It was a cookie skillet and the cookie was completely and utterly raw. She gave us our check that we requested right away and we saw that she had charged us for the appetizer that we never received. We had to wave down a busser again to ask for the manager. He came over and I explained everything to him (it was a different manager than the first time) and I suggested it was a lack of training, to which he agreed. He did apologize and comped our wine and beer, which we appreciated. He also confirmed that the cookie skillet was supposed to be crispy, not completely raw.   Like I said, I want to like this restaurant because it's beautiful and the staff were very nice. However, the blatant and numerous errors and lack of attention to detail displayed by our server does to a degree reflect on the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"A wonderful hidden treasure.  Use the entrance off of Riggs to get in.  Best time is 3 to 6 Happy Hour - prices are great.  Service is extraordinarily.  So glad we discovered this great place to eat.  The pizza is on par with Amalfi's or Sals Gilbert Pizza.  Thin crust and made to order.  Very happy experience.  Try the Tempura fried Brussels.  Nice."}
{"text":"On Thursdays, its all you can eat for $12.00. The night we went, it was salad with all the toppings, potatoes, Chicken, soup, breads, vegetables, desserts. For the price, it was great.  Had a 3 man music group. While eating, great view.  Plus cash bar. It was something different, eating in a club house, very nice dining area. Casual to dress. under  new management I was told. Older age group but for the price, great deal. open to everyone. no issues parking."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant which has been recently remodeled and has a revamped menu, in my own community. Broad enough menu, only ok wine selections, live music on Fridays and Saturdays. They have a great Cobb Salad. Generous portions. A wood-fired pizza oven is a nice bonus. Prime Rib specials on Saturdays are a good value and tasty. Pretty crowded F&S during the season. I recommend a reservation. Service can be slow. Beautiful view of the lake, fountains and golf course. Nice outside patio with fire pit table seating."}
{"text":"New residents of Oakwood.  We ordered chicken pesto pasta, meatloaf, and happy hour.  Wine and beer were great.  Service was alright. Atmosphere is great, very busy with nice decor.  Food was okay.  Asked for more meatloaf gravy and the meatloaf went to good. Seniors were in mass waiting for a seat at the door."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  The atmosphere and grounds are lovely.   I went on a Sunday (3/19) for a birthday buffet brunch.  The restaurant is spacious and comfortable.  The buffet was delicious with a good variety of foods and is very reasonably priced.  The omellet station is very good as well as the bacon and eggs.  The server we had;Brian was knowledgeable about the foods and made great suggestions.  My family and I had a wonderful time and will be back.  Dollar mimosas cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast during a visit with my Grandma.  This place is located in your typical active senior living community clubhouse thing.  It was nice and overlooked the golf course.  It was about 11am on a Sunday and wasn't overly crowded which surprised me.  Their menu was pretty standard and had all your typical breakfast fare at very reasonable prices.  I opted for the omelet station where they had a bunch of fresh ingredients to add, fruit, pastries, carved ham and other misc. stuff.  It was all very good and my omelet turned out excellent.  The service was fast and friendly.  It really does take a very special type of person to work at a place that serves almost exclusively older folks who are very demanding and can be very difficult at times.  If I am ever in the area around breakfast time and visiting Grandma then I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Didn't provide bread prior to entrees.  Told later, we could have ordered six biscuits for $1.50.  Very tacky of a place trying to impress. The seafood cocktail, shrimp and crap meat didn't come with a cocktail fork.  Had to use our large dinners forks.  Again, very tacky.    The bad thing is, we submitted a comment card to them a week or so ago when we were there the first time.  Went yesterday, and they had made no changes.  Appears this Country Club restaurant is working with Denny's management."}
{"text":"This is our second visit here and last. During our first visit we were told we needed a reservation for the fire tables in the patio and during our entire visit no one sat there but they did not allow us to sit there because we did not reserve it. Yesterday I called to reserve it for a party of 9 and we were excited to drive 2hrs to get to our family reunion on a lake side fire table but unfortunately they did not honor our reservation and gave it to another party.  Manager Lea made it clear that that happens and our 2hr drive was not a big deal since a lot of their guest drive that or more, she gave us a $5 discount and was rude. Very sad to see a great place being managed by a rude person. I am all about the experience and even though the food is good I would not give them my business again."}
{"text":"i absolutely love this place my waitress Tricia is so sweet and kind and i recommend asking for her"}
{"text":"Breakfast was blah. The buttermilk pancakes with bananas foster was bisquick with sliced bananas and maple syrup. The spanakopita skillet was canned mushrooms, spinach, garlic, etc.. Very slow service."}
{"text":"Mother's Day brunch was solid.  Nice casual brunch in the ballroom.  Food was good. Enough for both kids and adults to enjoy. Would do again for future holidays like Mother's Day and Father's Day."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Don't let them seat you by the pizza oven. This seems to be their meeting room! You can see them all play around even though the manager is totally oblivious. One waitress was eating cake, talking with her mouth full and wiping her mouth with her hands. The waiters were shouting across the room... Totally unprofessional.  One waiter was singing \"what's your name what's your number\".  I almost got up and gave it to him. I admit it was a busy night but I could probably tell you what allot of the employees problems were. Go to the break room, the kitchen or any place where your customers can't hear! If I came back I would refuse to be seated by the pizza oven."}
{"text":"Good food, nice portions, not too loud so you can enjoy each other's company. Will come back & try something new each time, lots to choose from."}
{"text":"We love Stone and Barrel. You don't have to be retired to enjoy this hidden gem in Oakwood! We love it here. We sat on the back patio and watched the sun set by the lake while having our dinner. The tables with the fire pit once the sun go down are fantastic! The service was great! We got the bartender somehow and  he was very good. We had the pesto chicken pasta and the halibut fish and chips were fantastic! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was an easy five! The presentation and taste was excellent! Kenny, our server, was also very attentive and friendly. We tried two different types of burgers and the veggie bowl which I substituted salmon for shrimp. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Eat there frequently and have never been disappointed. Have tried most every menu item and each one was delicious. Very reasonable prices for very good quality food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After the golf tournament we headed to the restaurant for lunch. When we got there we sat on the patio. Seem, at the time, that there was only one server tending the patio. So it took about 20 minutes before we got our menus and glasses of water. Finally got our order in. I had the Romaine and Iceberg Chopped Salad which had Romaine and iceberg lettuce, pistachios, olives, pepperoncini, salami, pepperoni, parsley and mozzarella cheese with Italian dressing. It was fresh, crunchy and tangy. Loved it. The only problem I had later on was the 'D' word. That evening on the AZ News channel, there was a warning about ECOLI in the romaine lettuce grown in southern AZ.  Keeping my fingers crossed."}
{"text":"As members of the IronOaks Country Club, we have dined here at our clubhouse quite often... hosting more that 30 people here so far this year. The dining room is attractive and intimate, and the large deck looks over the lake with its fountain and golf course. Most recently, we took a guest for luncheon and sat outside. Eryn served us and was quite lovely. Stacia is always very friendly and helpful... in fact all of the staff are very professional and courteous... and yet fun. The food is delicious, and the prices are more than fair. Sunday brunch is $15, and  Mimosas then are $2 and tall, stiff Bloody Marys are $3. What more could you want!"}
{"text":"Had prime rib special last night. It was very good. Done exactly as ordered. Garlic mashed potatoes were great and we split a wedge salad which was perfect. House wine very reasonable and cocktails were also reasonably priced and great. New restaurant and doing a good job."}
{"text":"I had dinner there with my family.  I  invited my family to the clubhouse since i was a resident of oakwood country club and ironoaks community. It was usually busy on saturday nite so i made reservations. When we arrived, it was very disorganized. No one in charge or at the host desk. They had no seats even when we had reservations at 7 pm. They made us wait and people who did not have reservations were seated ahead of us.. They apparently didnt have a record of my reservations. By the time we got seated it was after 8 pm. We ordered our meals and it yet another hour before receiving our meals. The meals were nothing special and their prices are pricey..."}
