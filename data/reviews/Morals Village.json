{"text":"Great Chinese traditional food and excellent service!Whenever and whatever you need they will come to you ASAP.Definitely recommend the staff Shade and Yan,they are super nice and very helpful.Will be back for sure!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Morals last night, we had been wait for 1 hr for the table. The food was average, would go back if I'm in that area again."}
{"text":"Been to other AYCE hot pot places before and I can say this one goes to my favorites. Our friends got a table pretty quickly so we dont have to wait.

I agree on the posts here that there are hidden $$ for your soup base. I love that theres a lot of ingredients to choose from however you have to asked multiple times to get a good quantity of food.

Might not personally come back unless friends invite us."}
{"text":"Love the food, but they are very cheap that wouldn't let me have one extra ice cream cone that they give out to each person at the end of the meal. Also, the washroom is gross - every time I go it's disgusting. I'm not going to describe it but they should clean it more often. At least fix the water leaking problem."}
{"text":"It was gr8. The food was fresh, servers were very friendly. They recommended my mom and I a lot of stuff to try. The ice cream was creamy and the spicy hot pot was very spicy and it numbs your mouth in a good way. It is a little bit pricey but they do have more food selection and friendly staff. It's a very busy spot so I strongly recommande people to make reservations before they go or else u will wait in the line forever. The only thing that I think they shouldn't do is to surcharge all the drinks. Also tips are 6 dollars so be ready for that."}
{"text":"Not as good as the one uptown, no dumb iPad, and food was fresher, beef still pretty fresh, but meat balls were frozen"}
{"text":"Perfect place to hang out with your friend. The best authentic chinese hotpot in downtown toronto."}
{"text":"Food is okay, service is terrible. Not once did the server refill our water, soup base or take away empty plates. The portion at this place is very small, for example, 1 portion of potato is 2 thin slices! When I asked for more seaweed than the 6 pieces (3 portions) the server brought over, he started arguing with me that this is how they do it.   I couldn't believe it. Also not everything we ordered came to the table, maybe only 60%. Would not recommend this place. I will not come back again."}
{"text":"Racist place to go for hotpot. If you are not from China and cannot speak Mandarin , don't expect to get a table to sit until every chinese has been served. Waited for 2.5 hours to complain and they kept telling us that it's too crammed and that there's no table for us. 

Confused and very unimpressed .."}
{"text":"All you can eat hot pot! What more can you say. Certainly seems like Hot pot is the new trend in Toronto nowadays. Morals location wise is the somewhat new T&T/Condo plaza in Markham. Parking I have to say is quite horrendous. They do have underground parking which you can usually find a spot but it is still a bit of a walk to the restaurant. I went on a late week day night so there was not a wait to get a table. The service is somewhat attentive, english/chinese speakers beware. Service is mainly in Mandarin or the traditional ordering language of finger menu pointing. A few orders were missed which was expected and not that big of an issue. They do have quite a few different type of soup bases that are not seen in other Hot Pot places which is nice but then they do charge a premium for them. I tried the tomato one which is nice and sweet but then again when its hot pot all that matters is if its spicy or not. Probably will just stick to regular type soup next time. The food seemed fresh and the service was quick to add water and take away empty plates. They have all the usual types of meats/balls/veggies but not much seafood at all unless getting charged extra which is a shame. Most of the other places will include some basic seafood items. The only complain I would have is that their dessert/ice cream is quite disappointing. You can only get ONE ice cream person and thats it. I do not understand that for an all you can eat place. That aside, if you are ok with all the extra charges for premium items Morels is pretty good. A little higher scale type of hot pot."}
{"text":"This is the best and first service oriented Chinese restaurant! Usually typical Chinese restaurant is chef oriented and they dont care about service. The waiter here is nice and wormhearted, especially YAN! remember come to him when you eat here."}
{"text":"Morals Village is now my go-to hot pot place. I really enjoy the variety of soup bases they have. I especially like their lamb slices, cheese stuffed beef balls, fried buns (so tasty with condensed milk) and all the vegetables. I've also been to their Markham location but I prefer this downtown one because they have a separate dipping sauce station."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible experience.

Our group of friends were very excited to try this new Hotpot location (being hotpot frequenters) but were extremely disappointed with the service. 
Upon stating our reservation name, we were seated quickly after entering the restaurant. 
At this point there were about 4 other tables filled in the restaurant (6:30pm on a Tuesday). 

Our soupbases arrived in about 1-2mins after placing our order, with two items (out of 15). But nothing else came for the next 20 mins. Our meat arrived but we were still waiting on the 10+ items we ordered. We inquired about our order, at which time it was taken again, with no apology or explanation. 

After a few more minutes 6 more items came out, but not everything we ordered (we were beginning to think that not everything was available, but were not told by our server). At this point we decided to order more items (another 15+ items). Within 10mins our first vegetable item for the night arrived (we had requested vegetable items in our first order). 

Another 20mins later, when we did not receive any more items, we called a server inquiring about our order AGAIN. At this point this server apologized and said he would check on the order. 

10mins later we decide to ask for the bill and leave. We were not offered any accommodations or apologies. 

Our bill came out to approximately $170. We paid $190 cash and requested change. When change arrived we decided to take out $2 and leave some tip $18+ (in good faith that maybe it was just a VERY bad day). 

The server came back with the change saying that we had to pay 10% tip. Nowhere on the menu did we see this, but besides that, we did leave 10% tip! At this point another server came over to say it's okay, as if they were doing us the favour. 

A very unpleasant experience that left you with a very bad taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"We came on a weekend, the tables weren't entirely full, but service still wasn't good. 

We waited 30 minutes just to get to order the soup base, then another 15 min for the dishes to come. When we ordered our second set of dishes, it took another 30 minutes, and we had to kept on asking when food is coming. A couple of dishes were missing from our order, so we had to ask again and wait some more. 

Then the server came and asked if we are ready to pay, when we were still waiting for our order. They have a 2-hour max eating time... but we spent most of that time waiting for food... 

It came to about $40 per person (they charge per person fee, and also the soup base). It doesn't feel like it's worth it. Plus, after a few bites, everything start to taste the same, since food goes into the same soup base to be cooked."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. I would give zero star if I could. 
Waiter refused our seat request. It was 9:30 pm on a week day, we were seated in the worst table while there were many available tables that weren't reservered. One of the center table were even taken by a staff who spent an entire hour on her phone. 

Basic service etiquette lesson should be taught to all the waiters. They were pretty much missing in the duration of our meal and were unbelievably hard to flag down. They were rude when I pointed out the mushroom they served is different from the menu. It's their normal practice to fool the customers with brown Enokitake, and claim it \"Masutake\" that charges extra $5. 

No apologies, no compensation were offered in the end. The general waiters attitude left us feeling we were lousy troublemaker trying to ask too much and being picky. Very pricey considering the experience. I would not recommend this place to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Good assortment of products but was really pricey for hotpot.

The decor of the restaurant was nice and very modern. My party of three was seated at a comfortable booth with enough space for all the dishes we ordered. The price for a Saturday night is $25.99 + $2 for a weekend surcharge. We ordered the Mountain Cliff Wild Mushroom and Hong Kong Satay soupbases. Both were excellent! However, towards the end of the night, the flavour was a little bit lost since the waiters refilled it with regular chicken broth as it decreased.

The best part of Morals Village is definitely their dipping sauce station!! They have a large variety of sauces to choose from: Sesame Oil to Satay Sauce. I ended up with several bowls of a variety of mixes just to vary the flavours.

I absolutely loved their variety of seafood and meats. They also offer homemade beef balls with cheese filling. I would definitely recommend giving this a try! We also ordered their fresh watermelon juice ($8.50) which was enough for three people. Very fresh and a nice add-on to cleanse your palette. 

The waiters record your orders on iPads which was pretty cool. However, they did forget several of our orders which was unfortunate. In relation to the service of the staff, they were very attentive and constantly came around to refill our broth, clear away our empty plates, and asked if we wanted to order anything else. At one point during the night, they even placed a small portable table near ours to hold all of our dishes. 

One of the downsides of Morals Village was definitely their lack of dessert. They only offer a vanilla soft-serve cone. They were also out of the fried bun with condensed milk and wouldn't be getting for another two weeks due to unexpected high demand. I was really looking forward to this :( . 

At the end of the night, the bill came to $100 (not including tip) for three people which included our added soupbases and fresh watermelon juice. Ouch!

In summary: Loved the variety, good service, but would dine here only occasionally due to the high price tag.

Atmosphere: 4/5 | Service: 4/5 | Price: 2/5"}
{"text":"Went to this highly recommended hot pot place with 7 friends last night. The service was horrible. Only half of the food came. We kept ordering and the food kept NOT coming. At 8pm, the server had the guts to come tell us that it's time to leave (first seating 6-8pm). We told him that half the food we ordered never came and we kept reminding various servers. We were totally neglected. It seems like the restaurant's strategy is to drag on till the time is up and kick you out without providing the food.

This place is more expensive than most hot pot places. We expect better service and food quality. Service ... sucks. Most servers didn't know what they're doing. Unlike other hot pot places, the soup and drinks (most come with basic drinks) cost extra. The menu also lack luster, offering less choices than most hot pot places. If you're allergic to MSG, please stay away from this place. I drank buckets of water last night and so did my friends. 

The only plus is that the decor is better than most other hot pot restaurants. But the washrooms do need attention in terms of cleanliness. Will any of our party of 8 go back again? For sure NO! Do yourself a favour and stay away. On a side note, I have never been to this plaza, there is a nice and quiet T&T Supermarket there which I'll visit again."}
{"text":"What a great way to eat with friends and family. Everyone enjoys their own quantity of food.
The food is exceptionally fresh and value for money.   They had a special extra hot (5 x chillies) soup that just became my new favourite.  It had both spunk and flavour!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and broth choices. 

I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday not too long ago. There were 7 of us. We had to call in for a reservation. We had to wait for our table for about 5 - 10 minutes but the hostess was very sweet and apologized for the wait. We sat down and immediately someone came over and asked if we wanted a round of ice water while looking at the menu. The menu is easy to read and follow and it was all you can eat! We were here for about 3 hours. Over all, friendly service, it is quick and easy, this location is definitely one of my favourite places to have hot pot from now on."}
{"text":"This place is becoming my go to spot for hot pot - been back twice this month. Being the hotpot addict I am, I'd say quality of the food here is above average and the place rarely runs out of items listed on the menu even if you are there late (unlike other popular hotpot places ie Kim Tao, Celebrity etc.). The differentiator for this place is got to be the service! Though the hostess is hanging by a thread for below average, our server (Bill) definitely makes up for it. Will be back again."}
{"text":"One star was taken off because they did not pick up their phone.  A Wednesday night dinner for 3 did not needed to wait long, also I was just a little shocked that I had to pay extra for soup base and drinks, whereas many other places came with it for free. 

Food was good, I could not complaint about it. Decor was amazing and service was awesome! I did had a great experience at the restaurant and will most definitely come back, probably on a weekday."}
{"text":"This place doesn't take credit card as indicated on their page. Our bill was $261 before tax. I gave $320 cash. The cashier had the nerve to come over and asked for more tips. (Who does that?!) I said I would definitely be happy to tip more if they would take my credit card but of course they refused. 

For their price, there are much better hotpot restaurants in Richmond hill that come with lobster. I would never return to moral village again and will not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I have been to this place multiple times and I first have to start off by saying this is by far the nicest looking hot pot place in the China town area. This place is also always busy if not packed. Come at off-peak hours or you will definitely be waiting, and it could be for an hour.  

Unfortunately, what had them lose their first star was related to this. They have the tendency to have a set amount of tables open and they won't sit smaller dinner parties at larger tables even when the restaurant is quite empty (10 at night). If there are a few 2 person parties they will not let them sit at any of the larger tables (6 - 8 person tables), instead, they will insist that you wait for the 2 person tables. 

Once you do get seated the service is good (ordering is done through the waiter and their iPads), and the food is great. You are asked to choose your soup base from a selection of about 10 (each costing different amounts (~$5)). 

The food has high quality and a great selection of handmade meatballs, various seafood, and of course tons of different meats. You also have the option to add more premium meats for a price (some worth some not because once it goes into the pot it all tastes very similar).   In addition to the meats, they have a selection of fresh fruit drinks and smoothies. 

The largest issue with all these offerings is the price. It comes down to personal preference but when it comes to hot pot I like lamb meat, meats balls, red sausage, and spam. I really don't need much else. Now I am all down for paying more for other options (if the people I'm eating with want seafood or other meats) but the base starting price point is just too high for me. I am paying for a bunch of things that I simply will not order. I prefer the model of the other hot pot places that start you at a very basic food offering and then charge you more per person if you want other things.

TL;DR Arbitrarily long wait times and a high starting price offering food options that some people may not enjoy."}
{"text":"The one waiter we had was great but the manager clearly does not care about retaining a customer base or anything even close to such intentions. I went there for my sisters birthday and I am a vegetarian. They did not have any vegetarian soups, which is fine, except when I asked for just hot water in my pot, they said they had to charge me 2.50 for it. I was completely ready to pay the 23.99+tax for hot water and vegetables, but half of their items on their menu were also not available. When we asked to speak to the manager, he refused to come over and was hiding by the counter. 

With that said, the rest of the party I was with was impartial to the food. The beef was tough, the options were limited, they didnt even have tongs or soup spoons which would definitely help in the cooking process. Overall I miss our go to hot pot place that recently closed and was really hoping for a replacement. I will definitely not be returning and will be advising others to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was invited out for hotpot and since I don't get it that often I was delighted to go. We were going some place new near the TnT.   I am not sure what the name means,  perhaps it's an inside joke or something. 

At 41 years old I was the oldest person in the place.  Seriously,  oldest person and only white guy.  Talk about out of place!  Still if you want the best of any cuisine,  look for the one full of locals.  

Like everyone else we had to wait but with TnT next door we were able to get our grocery shopping done. 
We ended up waiting just over an hour. 

Once we were seated,  I was given the English menu. One commenter mentioned that as an issue.  It seems they have translated it. 

The decor is nice, lots of wood and clean lines.  Seats are large and ample and it is easy to walk through the restaurant,  which can sometimes be an issue. 

The soups were okay.  Could have used salt if you can believe it.  I ordered the herbal one.  The meat and veggies were excellent.  Fresh and plentiful.  The sauces could have been bigger though.  We all ordered the sesame sauce. 

All in all it wasn't bad,  but not really worth the wait. It was pricey with the bill being over $40 each. You can find comparable meal for less without the wait if you know where to go."}
{"text":"Pretty good.
Made a reservation a day in advance since I was bringing a group of 8. 
Service was alright, the server took our orders fairly fast and the soup and food arrived fairly fast.
Drinks are pricey. The good soup bases are sort of pricey."}
{"text":"Food was great; service was ok. We had a reservation for 7 p.m. on a Saturday, but we got caught in some stupid Pan-Am games traffic and ended up getting there around 7:20. They had given away our table by then (despite us calling first) but we only had to wait another 10-15 minutes to get a new table. 

Once we sat down and ordered, our food came super fast! We got four pots of broth, two spicy and two non-spicy, to share among six of us, which I think was plenty. The best items were the meat, which seemed to be pretty good quality; the stuffed meatball (beware of the hot cheese); the shrimp wonton; the fried mantou (served hot!) with the condensed milk dipping sauce; and I liked that their taro was in small pieces and pre-fried so it wouldn't take too long to cook. While our first batch came quickly, the other stuff we ordered came more piecemeal or required us to remind the waiter a second time. 

Things I wish they had: a sauce bar, like many places in Taiwan (though I did pretty well ordering the garlic sauce, sha-cha and chopped chives and mixing it all up); clams in the seafood options; Chinese cabbage (gao-li cai) and baby corn in the veggies; but overall I think they provided a pretty good list for an AYCE. 

The free ice cream at the end is also a nice touch. 

Though they have a two-hour limit, it wasn't enforced when we were there, probably because there wasn't a line when we were eating."}
{"text":"If I can give no stars, I would definitely do it!  But that one star that we have to compulsorily give can be for the ambience maybe.
I can't begin to tell what a bad experience I had in this place. It was my first time here with my family. We came here to celebrate my brother's bday. It was in the afternoon around 2 pm on a Sunday that we walked in this place. It was not busy and it looked like a huge group of 10 people were about to leave. We waited to be seated and after a 10 mins wait we were shown to our seats. 

When we received our menus we realized it was in Chinese. We politely asked for English menus and they gave us just two English menus for a group of 6 people. Anyways, when the server came
To take our order, he was talking in chinese. We answered in English but he didn't seem to know much of it or maybe acted like he did not know??

We ordered our first round of food with a lot of actions and pointing. But when we ordered the second round, the food did not come for a good 15 min. I mean how long does it take to bring raw food on the table? Especially when there were no customers at that time ?

The service was so slow. When we asked for water, it did not even arrive until the end of our meal!! And I saw a big group of servers just sitting around in the corner of the restaurant chatting away.

After all this almost at the end of our meal we asked for an ice cream cone (tiny ice cream cone) for my niece which they serve as dessert.They obliged. But when we asked for one more ice cream again, the server came back and told us that they were out of stock. It's ridiculous coz it said in the menu that we can order dessert of an ice cream cone (1 for each person). We flipped out and told him that it's just not done and that all of us in the table did not even get our share of ice cream. The server then said we have to wait for 10 mins or so to get the ice cream. We said that it is fine coz we already waited for so long. The server went back to his group of servers and started laughing. Seemed like they planned to tell us about the no ice cream story just to see our reaction. Looked like they were jus testing us. 

Eventually the ice cream was not served, we then stopped another server and gave him our ice cream order again, he obliged. Which meant that the server who was dealing with us was lying. 

By the end of the meal our mood was completely spoilt that we did not feel like staying any longer. I really don't have any thing to say about the quality of the food, it's coz the experience was so bad.. we din enjoy our food at all. 
 
End of the story - I guess they treated us this way coz we dint speak Chinese ?? That's the only reason we could think of coz we were a pretty reasonable group who did not even order heaps and heaps of food. We were not even demanding. 
So a little bit of advice to you folks who do not speak Chinese - stay away from this place. 
And in general to everyone - STAY AWAY. 

No customer should be treated this way. If they treat their customer this way, they really don't deserve customers."}
{"text":"Service is slow, extremely slow. Waited forever between servings. Not worth the money. Also, two out of the four ingredients I ordered were not available, not sure if they ran out or whatnot. And some of the dishes never arrived and had to be ordered twice. Waste of time and waste of money for me."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for hotpot, I've been to many of them but it's not the cheapest.

It's located beside TNT Supermarket and there are plenty of parking spots available both outdoor and underground.

This place is more of a higher end hotpot restaurant, it's very clean for a Chinese restaurant, just watching the way they clean up their tables show how much they pay attention to details in terms of keeping everything clean.

Food selection is great, everything you ever wanted for a Chinese hotpot.  The one thing this place shines compared to other hotpot places is the quality of the food.  Shrimps and squids are good quality seafood items.  They also offer premium beef at extra cost, I believe they're Kobe beefs.  I loved their selection of sauces!

I was impressed with their willingness to bring out meat, a lot of hotpot places are cheap when it comes to meat but this place was amazing, non-stop lamb and beef."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and consistent with other locations but service is completely junk!

Only the first batch of lamb actually came and all subsequent orders never came.  We had to order twice and both times the meat never came.  We ordered drinks and that never came until we notified the server a few times.  They never refilled our soup until we notified the server, it isn't like this at other locations.  Not sure why this location's service is poor compared to their Markham location.  A lot of kids work at this location, maybe lack of experience?  Service is just extremely poor.  Management, if you are reading this, you need to better train your guys.

The environment is good, the place is very well furnished/modern and they also have private rooms available which is pretty cool for group events.

The good thing about this location is all the sauces are self served, I think it's much better this way and the sauce area is kept pretty clean, no flies flying around or anything like that.

As always though this place offers good quality hotpot food but it's not cheap, you're looking at $45 per person after everything.  If it is too expensive, there is another well know hotpot chain  just across the street called Little Sheet Mongolian Hotpot, that place isn't bad but this place is more upscale."}
{"text":"Probably the best HotPot you can get in the downtown area. Great soupbases (original, green, tomato and corn are the goto).

They also have fried mantou buns! Essentially fried bread that you can eat with a side of condensed milk.
Worth the additional price compared to other hotpot places in the area."}
{"text":"I am writing an update review based on my second time back. The business extended an invitation for a dinner back and that's a nice goodwill gesture. My second time back was much better. The service was good and they came around with a tablet so it looks like they have improved their ordering system. I certainly hope that this is the service level that they will maintain going forward."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, service is decent but slow but definitely not worth the price they're charging. It is way too expensive (around $40 a person). Probably never going to come back just because it's not worth it money wise."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying an AYCE hotpot place. Got here around 5pm on a weekday and it was already full! Good thing my friend made a reservation. All of the servers there spoke mandarin and barely English. The server kept telling us that we had to place our order soon as there's a time limit to the buffet. I found that quite annoying. I don't speak any mandarin and I kept trying to tell him that we were waiting for another friend. I don't think he understood. Finally, my friend came and we ordered all at once. 

There's lots of choices on the menu but the menu I was given was all in simplified Chinese! Kinda had to guess as I can only read traditional. There's lots of choices for meat, fish balls, vegetables, and noodles! However, the quality of the food isn't the best. The luncheon meat (spam) was very slimy and doesn't really taste like anything. A lot of the fish balls weren't the best. I also ordered the scallops (add-on) and would have expected better for the price I paid. The scallops weren't defrosted. They were all hard and I had to wait for them to defrost until I could put them in the pot. They should be defrosted upon ordering. If cooked frozen, the scallops would be very rough and tough. They were high quality scallops, but not prepared properly for serving. 

Also, the switch on my pot kept switching off. Every time happened I would have to call a server to start it up for me again. That was quite annoying. 

As for the price, almost $40 per person after the soup base price + AYCE price + tax + tips. I think the money could be spent on higher quality food with better service."}
{"text":"I love winter because that means it's hot pot season! I'm giving two stars to Morals for their variety of options - my favorite was their handmade balls and sliced meat. Their sliced beef was marbled-just-enough despite it not being the premium option. They also offer handmade shrimp balls and octopus balls, yum. 

Service was a tad bit slow and limited to mostly mandarin. Some of the challenges that our group had: 
- Food items: The english and chinese menus were different and there were more items on the chinese
- Alcohol: Once we were seated, our group ordered beers that were forgotten, twice 
- Soup base: The default soup is the individual, there's a surcharge to order the larger pots for sharing. As a fan of spicy \"ma lat/??\" soups, I found that the soups here were more on the numbing side than spicy

What I did really enjoy about the place was their seating! Typically, many hot pot places are more cramped. I found that Morals was more comfortable and overall, cleaner. 

Parking is usually a pain in this plaza - Go underground to the tnt parking instead
And definitely make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. Made a booking and went 15mins early. Didn't get seated untill 1.5hrs of waiting."}
{"text":"Actual food is not bad. Service was quite bad all the way through. Food to cook never came, complained twice, still never came. We then complained to the manager and then stuff finally rolled out. Was not going to tip but when time came to pay, I still tipped 12% out of courtesy BUT the payment came close to 50$ because they automatically charged 15% service for a table of 4?! And the waitress didn't say a word. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"The worst service ever, it is really hard to find someone to help you, you might need to yell to get somebody's attention, finally your order is coming, however orders coming slow with missing some of them,  orders' portion are very small and random,  looks like it does not matter how much you order, they just provide what they think it should be.

Food is okay, but I would say it is not impressive, quite a few other hot pot joints in town are better.

Overall, this is a very pricy place with subpar service and food, very disappointed."}
{"text":"This hot pot place is really good compare to the other hot pot places. Their AAA slice beef is really good and their watermelon juice is good to with their hot pot food. Their pots are available in small or large and you choose your soup, at separate charge. They have a good selection of selected dishes for hot pot and their customer service is good!! Best in markham so far...!"}
{"text":"Ok this place is not 2.5 stars so I am giving the ratings a boost to where it should really sit at 3.5 to 3.8 stars. 

Came in on a Thursday night as a walk-in and had no trouble finding a booth. It was pretty busy and I'm sure if you came with a larger group 4-6 you would probably have a little waiting to do. Although there is a 2 hour limit for dining. 

Cash only! So go to the bank machine prior to getting here or have your girlfriend wait by herself while you run across the street to CIBC or RBC down on Spadina/Dundas. I seen a couple of girlfriends in limbo after the couple discovered it was cash only lol. Or not enough cash to cover dinner and tip. Which is $35/person not including tip yet. 

Service for us was good surprisingly after reading all these reviews that the service sucked. Maybe Yelp made them pay attention! Good job yelpers! But our waitress was never too far away to take our orders and food came pretty fast like within 5 mins. A waiter even came by the check if we got our last order for the 2nd round. 

I order the \"super spicy\" broth which is an additoinal 4 bucks and it is what it said friggin super spicy! My lips turned into Kendal Jenner's fat red lip challenge after a few minutes of eating and my taste buds were totally wiped out after the 1st round. I love spicy food (Sichuan style) but this was a little too spicy for me to enjoy. Although it was still good I wish I ordered the normal spicy. (They have the option of how much you want from high to low). 

The ingredients were ok. The meats were better quality then other hot pots in the area. But some of the veggies were not that fresh but still edible. They give you portions according to your group to avoid waste. So you may find yourself ordering more frequently then other places such as Little Sheep etc where they give you quantity. 

They have a sauce station which faces the entrance which i found weird as you are greeted by a bunch of people making sauces as soon as you climb to the top of the stairs. But whatever works. 

Overall this place was good. Reminds me of Hai Dai Lao hot pot in Beijing and Shanghai minus the dancing noodle guy.

I would come back to this place but only during the week days since they jack up the prices on Friday-Sunday for some reason. 

Oh and they play top40 music in the background a little bit loud so it's more of a place for younger crowds unless your parents and grandparents don't mind hotpoting to hotline bling.."}

Service: 1/5 Rude, Slow.
Environment: 4/5 Nice, unless you got a folding chair.  
Washrooms: 4/5 Fine. 
Worth it?: 2/5 Service was terrible. 

After an hour wait we finally got in. We promptly made our first order. They started bring them out putting them anywhere they could without a word. They quickly rush out before you can ask them anything. 

We we're missing a few things like soy sauce and spring rolls. We let service know and they said they would bring it. It still  didn't come. We nicely asked for it again and again and still they never came. We didn't have any dipping sauce yet food was still come out. We ate any ways and asked again for soy sauce with out next order. 

Food continued to come out and we had to firmly ask one of the services if they could make sure we get the soy sauce before he does anything. Else for us because we had asked 7 times before this. 

It finally came but I am still missing my spring rolls and red sausage. 

Service is rather rude and don't really care about helping you out. I don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this hotpot place, though it was a holiday and we didn't have reservations so we had to eat at 4pm.  

The soup base is additional charge, we tried corn, mushroom, and pork bone.

Food variety and freshness was good, but they ran out of several key items which was disappointing (cheese meatball, squid paste, squid dumpling, etc.).  Considering it is more expensive weekend/holiday pricing, I would expect their food to be fully stocked.

Service was great!  Our server would always appear once we were about to order something and food arrived promptly.  Location at Kennedy and Hwy 7 is convenient, and restaurant is nice and new."}
{"text":"This place is going downhill and needs to be closed down. This hotpot use to attract people for its individual pots rather than shared pots. Now, a group of four has to share one pot. I'm not saying that that's the only reason for this low review. The service is horrible, the waiters stop coming and stop bringing food after one round just to try to push you out. Unless you speak fluent Mandarin, not even Cantonese, you will not have a good time

I will not be coming back to this restaurant ever again regardless if there is a change in management or not. This place is clearly slowing down because of many new hotpot restaurants opening all throughout Markham. Good luck trying to compete morals.  Worst hotpot place ever.  

Don't take this review lightly. I will not be giving this restaurant \"another try\""}
{"text":"Good food. The place was packed and the service slightly slow as a consequence. The waiters were friendly. Great group experience"}
{"text":"Food was good! Service sucks. It's a give or take situation you basically get all the things first that is not the meat and might have to wait a while for the meat to come. Sometimes things you order don't come so you have to reorder. It doesn't make sense for your food not to come because when you order the pinch it in instantly on the iPad. So if you don't care about service or waiting this is your spot! I would give it 4 stars for food but 0 stars for service."}
{"text":"The spicy broth is AMAZING!!! If you are a hot pot lover, you have to try it. The best hot pot restaurant I ever had in the North American. Love it."}
{"text":"TBH, the food was ok, BUT the service was bad... most of the waiters kind had their own attitude which s really impressive.... lollll  and there was one waiter who weared slipper and sport pants doing service..... they didnt even remjnd us when was the last call......"}
{"text":"Interesting spot to try hot pot. The food is good but service is average, place is noisy and you feel rushed. Ice cream dessert is a nice touch. You'll enjoy if you really like hot pot otherwise it isn't great value for money."}
{"text":"Finally got to try hot pot at Morals Village  ~ 
I had their original spicy soup base and it was one of the best ones I've had yet! It was very flavourful and very spicy. It complemented the lamb slices and veggies perfectly. I was also very impressed with the service; many hot pot places tend to forget a lot of items you have ordered and I would have to keep ordering to get just one order of it. This place I would only order once and it would come right away! I was very impressed. Just wished they had fried gluten, it's my favourite thing to eat at hot pot D':"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night at 8pm and it was PACKED! Had to wait about 20-30 minutes for a table for two. The atmosphere is very busy, and very clean. It is definitely on the higher end of hot-pot restaurants (which is definitely reflected in the price). The total cost of our dinner for two was just under $70.. which included the price for two small soup bases (pork bone and satay). The waitress recommended getting two small pots instead of a large split pot because you have to pay an extra $3-4 for a split pot.

I liked the satay soup base a lot more than the pork bone one, would definitely get that one again! The meat quality is good, and the service is quick. Our waitress was really friendly. I did not see the appeal in the fried buns with condensed milk that everyone else does... the buns were kind of cold and hard.. maybe they were old since it was around 9pm when we got them. 

Although it is a little pricey, I don't mind spending a little more once in a while for good hot pot."}
{"text":"I've already been to Morals Village a number of times but never wrote a review until now. Everytime I have come here, the food and service has been consistent. 

The restaurant is fairly busy especially later on in the evenings. We came in the early evening on a weekday this time knowing that. We were seated immediately as there was still plenty of empty seating. I ordered the split soup base (french corn and sweet tomato). Both had a nice flavour to them without being either too mild or too strong. The servers were attentive and placed our ordered almost immediately whenever we wanted to add more food. The food came very quickly, was fresh, and were nice portions. The server refilled our soup with more broth whenever it was about half empty. 

I would highly recommend this AYCE hotpot as it scores high on service and food quality which is normally hard to find."}
{"text":"Poor guy Service 

Tonight was the first time that I visited Morals Village. I was so disappointed with the service. The waiters were unhelpful. No one comes to your to take an order, even we waved at them, unless we asked them to come . I guess we may waited for more than 15mins to make an order.Most of the time the waiters just chatting with each other but not serving the customers. By the way , they never made a correct order as well. We have to order twice to get all the food we need.

What make things worse was the attitude of the staff. My friend and I could not speak really well Chinese but sadly we understand Chinese. When the waiter realised we could only use broken Chinese to make an order , they started to make fun of you in Chinese.It is a pity that we understand Chinese quite well, so we totally know what's going on.The waiters were so rude ,even my friend who can't speak Chinese can feel that.I understand it is quite fun when you see someone could not speak your language well as they may make lots of joke. However, it just silly to tease your customers in front of them.

We came here for the enjoyment of food but we left with terrible dinning experience . I'm so sorry for those unprofessional staffs as they make the customer to stay away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"so good?excellent?best experience ever?so cheap if you are from US, this is ABSOLUTELY the right place! Beautiful dishes, welcoming service, nice environment. Staffs are so considerate. Five stars, recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night, luckily it wasn't very busy because we were able to be seated right away. Very friendly service, and even better food. We good the mild spicy base and it was already super spicy. Food came quick and was plentiful. Some notable items: lamb, spicy fish, tofu skin, handmade noodles, etc.. They also give free ice cream at the end of the meal to cool you down. Would recommend you try this place out, it's worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Having gone to the Mississauga location, I wanted to try the Markham location to see if there was any difference. This interior was nicely designed, making the whole space very large and dark. Once you enter, there's someone at a booth waiting to bring you to your seat. 

We were seated at a table of 4, which has a little slit that separates the table beside which was also a table of 4. The seats were made so customers get their own pots. There was something weird about the stove as it was hard to adjust since it kept going really strong, however, after a while, it warms up. 

The food selection has quite a bit, however, you have to pay for the soups. There is no clean chicken soup like at other places. I tried the mushroom soup and also the tomato soup. The tomato soup was flavourful and had a strong tomato flavour. I would recommend this one. However, the mushroom soup wasn't very special. I couldn't taste much mushroom and it was too salty. 

The drinks like soy bean milk and sour plum juice also need to be ordered, they also have watermelon juice that is made fresh that's also very tasty.

Here, you order by telling the server and they input your selections onto an iPd. I would much rather they let you pick the items on an iPad yourself like at AYCE sushi places, or maybe have the food self-serve. I found it such a hassle trying to get the server's attention as most of them were busy. They didn't even refill my water until I asked them to twice. As well, you don't get to self-serve and mix your own sauces; you tell the server the kinds of sauces you want and they bring them to you in little bowls. I would prefer if I can make my own sauces as this was more work. They also didn't give spoons for the little bowls until we asked for them. The food was fresh, especially the meat like beef and lamb slices. If you like really spicy, I recommend the spicy beef balls, but other than that, the other balls weren't that good. Nothing really stood out to me in terms of the food options.

You order the fried mantous like you would with all the other food. Each table gets one soft serve vanilla ice cream cone which is cool. The ice cream wasn't very smooth but still a nice addition to hot pot. They also came on a cute little stand. 

Side note: the management of the staff in assigning tables to me that I received at the Mississauga location was quite negative, so the Markham location is better in that sense. 

Overall, the service was good and it was a decent experience, but I don't think there's anything too special that would Morals stand out and make me want to visit again."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and delicious?and the service was great, I have been asked if all orders came and if I need to order more. Waiters were able to be there at the first moment when we need. My friends and I had a good time there!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge hot pot fan and I was so excited when this place opened because I thought this could be my next go to place. I usually have hot pot at least once a month. Unfortunately I was quiet disappointed. 

The quality does not match the price. It has the  nicest decor in all of downtown Toronto for hot pot. The presentation of the food is also amazing. But soup base (I tried the spicy broth) just doesn't cut it. Also for the price I'm paying I would expect a way better service. After sitting down for almost 30 mins on Saturday for lunch, we finally managed to flagged down a waitress to take our order and that is not acceptable for a 80 dollar meal for 2."}
{"text":"This is the best hotpot! Corn soup and green spicy soup is a must try! The choices come in a large variety and it's always fresh! Service is better at their Chinatown location but I've never had great service at a hotpot restaurant. The downtown location also has soft serve ice cream cones as opposed to small scoop."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"While it was busy and the food was okay, I'm giving it 3 stars because of the quality of the service. I had called in advance to see if I could reserve a table (knowing it would be busy on a Friday but was told that they don't reserve for tables of 5 people and should just drop in. It's not a big deal but the girl on the phone wasn't very pleasant to talk to. Despite having bad service on the phone, we came anyway to try out luck and waited for over 45 minutes. When we were finally seated, the servers rushed us to order the food. We barely had time to crack open the menu before we were asked to order. 

The quality of the food was fairly good. The sauces came out quickly except for soy sauce. We had asked them to get us soy sauce 4 times but they always forgot to bring it. Finally, we had to just order soy sauce with no menu items to make sure we could get that sauce. 

At the end of the meal, we got ice cream! Each person at the table is able to have 1 soft serve each. :) The ice cream at the end was definitely the highlight of my meal. If you're looking for a hot pot place, this one is good for groups for more than 5 since you can reserve and have a table readily available. Be prepared for the servers to be lacking in presence BUT! If you just want simple hot pot, Morals Village is exactly that -- hot pot without the extra frills."}
{"text":"\"Let's start at the very beginning, a very good place to start.\" - Maria Von Trapp 

In this case, a not so good place to start, Maria. I was instructed upon arrival to type my name into the iPad. My friend and I then waited in an actual designated Waiting Room for 45 minutes for our two-person table. The hostess was literally running around the floor, bangs flying back from her face, shouting a mile-a-minute at waitstaff and customers. She approached us at one point to show us to our table... which was actually a table for Tina, party of five (not a reference to the show in any way). The hostess then asked for my name again, and instead of waiting for an answer, picked up the phone and completely ignored me.

Finally, we were seated near the sauce station. We had not one but two servers come to our table and then say \"just one minute\" and dart away elsewhere. Our server(s) were actually very friendly and helpful with the menu and explanation of the hot pot process, as we were first timers. One of our servers even waved over a co-worker to ask for the English translation on an item we asked about. 

The food itself was adequate. I have no real criticisms as I have no previous hot pot experience to compare it to. We ordered a vast array of items, mostly meats, meatballs, mushrooms and shrimp. The spicy soup bases are actually spicy. There was a well-stocked sauce-bar with accompanying spring rolls and toppings. One dish we ordered came twice. Some dishes we ordered didn't come at all. The ice cream at the end of the meal was a welcome treat. 

There's also this one spice or something that was on a few things we ordered and it's not even spicy -- it just makes your whole mouth crazy numb. At first, you're like okay, weird. Then as it progresses you're like \"this feels not great\", so you take a sip of water. HUGE MISTAKE. It's like your tongue just did a thousand crunches and is now taking a horribly somehow hot ice bath. 

When it finally came time to pay, they were taking cash only. A sign on the door or something would have been nice. Instead I had to run across the street to the ATM at Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot to pick up cash. Speaking of which, it smelled AMAZING in there, so if I was going to try hot pot again, I might go the Little Sheep route. It's also not cheap -- the AYCE on a weeknight was about $25 but there's an additional charge for the soup bases themselves. The bill also showed a $7 charge for... something. It wasn't English, and I didn't feel like waiting any longer to ask, considering this was a nearly three-hour ordeal. All in all, our meal came to $66 including taxes, not tip."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo SH*TTY!!!!! My sister went to Morals Village tonight with her frds, a total of 5 ppl and she waited 1 hr for a table, but that wasn't the issue. The real issue was the host named SILVER wouldnt give them a table when they were next on the waitlist. Instead she gave it to the 2 groups of 3 ppl that was on the end of the waitlist. When my sister asked why they couldn't get the table she said because the table offers 6 pots so she couldn't just leave that one pot space to waste. She was sooo rude and had such bad customer service!!! Never go to this restaurant!!!! Don't waste your time!!! AND at the end my sister left...poor sis."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant many times, now I decided to share my review.  Foods are fresh and the service are so nice and service food so fast. Especially the meat, beef and lam, high quality and fresh. They servers are so so so beautiful and handsome huh. Go try it ! You will have very well experience there . : )"}
{"text":"Came all the way from downtown. Food is better than the ones in dt. But TERRIBLE SERVICE. Be prepared to WAIT FOR MORE THAN ONE HOUR if you're going. 

By kept telling us someone is making the payment, they kept my group waiting for 1.5 hours standing at the door. Instead of an apology, the manager taught us to understand because it was busy when we were trying to tell him what has happened on us. 

Ok the story is we tried to book a table for 930pm and were told that it won't take long if we just show up at the store. Since there's usually not many large groups at that time, therefore a reservation is not necessary. 
They told us that there was only one group before us upon our arrival and kept telling us someone is making the payment and will leave SOON. We were not seated until waiting for 1.5 hrs. 
Just 30 mins later we were told that it was our last call. When we were trying to tell them what has happened, the \"manager\" came and said it's just really BUSY and you have to understand. When we asked for more ice-cream the manager told us that there is only four left. And those were for the other table beside us. Therefore we kindly saved the dessert for the others and left."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. I had reservations for 8 and had to wait about 5-10 minutes after my reservation to be seated but that was fine. The service was decent, we had people check in with us to make sure we were okay. All food requests came rather quickly but they did forget about our spring rolls and ice cream so we had to follow up which is expected at a ayce restaurant. Why they lost points was that I didnt like that I had to ask my server for fried buns, spring rolls and sauce.. the other location ive been to downtown had a self serve station. They also werent able to split the bill but we figured it out amongst ourselves. Overall I love this hotpot concept and its selection!"}
{"text":"Ive been to this location 2 times. Overall great concept, love the ability to have my individual pot, I dont like \"sharing food\" lol selection is good, price is on the higher end  but the experience, options and convenience makes up for it. I was against having hotpot anywhere but at home but those who have hosted hot pot gatherings know its a lot of work and clean up. Food is fresh and plentiful!"}
{"text":"Went here with 3 friends on a Sunday. We got there around 12pm - I would say this was just before the rush. Very nice looking environment.

Lots of different options on the menu. I got the 10-year special soup base, really flavorful and spicy. I'm not a huge fan of the individual personal pots because hot pot is always a big group activity kind of thing for me. All the meats were really fresh. Menu pretty much has everything you ever need for hot pot. Service was a little slow, but nothing crazy. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came when Morals Village was celebrating their 4-year anniversary with a 30% off deal (which is an interesting decision, given it being a chinese chain...) but superstition aside, it's discounted hotpot and since I've never tried Morals Village before, why not?

Once you step through the main door, you will see a long flight of stairs up. When you manage to make your way to the top, you will see a set of doors to the main restaurant area in front of you, but then if you take a look to the left and right, you'll see some other doorways to some other rooms!

On the right is the waiting area, featuring three TV's that weren't on that night, a coat rack, lots of chairs, and an over-priced vending machine selling $2.50 cans of pop and $3 Wang Lao Ji. Morals Village does take reservations, but if it's full, at least you have a place to relax until they call you over. I don't remember what was on the left, but I don't remember seeing an elevator, so if you have difficulty climbing two flights of stairs, things aren't looking good.

We had a reservation for 8, but the hostess tried to seat us at a table for 6. Not going to happen. Another employee came over to ask what's going on and we were given spot in one of the rooms in the back, which some refer to as the \"VIP room\". AC was very strong compared to the general dining area, which is great. It was a nice room with seating for 14, but unfortunately that was the only good thing about the VIP room in the end.

They have about a dozen soup bases that come in small or large pots, and a separate set of options for half-and-half. The sauce station comes with a a decent selection to choose from. They also have some spring rolls and fried buns on the side to snack on if you're dying.

When we sat down, a server came over and took our orders on an iPad. Soup came within 10 minutes, and food starting coming out shortly after. I went with the herbal soup, which was their pork bone soup with some herbal elements. Definitely liked the flavor. I also really liked the slices of lamb, beef, and pork. Mussels weren't bad either. There's quite a selection to choose from, including ox tongue, pork blood, and some other more interesting parts of an animal.

The first round of orders was pretty quick, but then the server never really came back. We asked for a spoon, and that never came until an hour into it and reminding 4 different servers. No check up to see whether any pots or cups needed re-fills. Not much service in general, even for further orders. So much for the VIP room. Perhaps VIP service only happens if we had a large enough party to fill the entire room, rather than half.

The main issue I had with service was how fast food was coming, and how many items weren't coming despite using an iPad to keep track of these things. Initially, they said they will bring in 8 orders of each of the three slices of meat, which came in 2 plates. However, for subsequent orders, they only came with half the amount, despite saying it was still 8 orders.

I mean, I guess it was busy since it was anniversary promotion on top of it being a relatively popular hotpot chain. Fortunately, we weren't asked to leave after 2 hours were up, cause things were just really slow overall."}
{"text":"The base is not good. It is spicy but not flavourful.     Decor looks fancy and service is ok. The options are so limited...."}
{"text":"We loved this place! The atmosphere is very modern and clean. The staff were super friendly and very helpful. It is not  like your typical Chinese restaurant where the waiters are inattentive and rude, at this place the servers are very patient and eager to help.  MY boyfriend and I came close to closing time on a Friday night and even though the waiters  wanted to start getting ready for closing, they were still very patient with us and made sure they didn't rush us to leave. 

The food was also really great, everything was really fresh and flavourful! Definitely recommend to anyone who is thinking about thing it out."}
{"text":"It was difficult to rate Morals because I have very mixed feelings.  There is quite a bit of potential here but horrible service and high prices pull it down.

Pros:
The decor was the first thing that you notice when you walk in and it's gorgeous.  Very modern and looks very expensive to put together.  Definitely great atmosphere when you walk in.

The food was good and presented very nicely.  I was very satisfied with the freshness of everything that we ordered and it tasted great.  I haven't been to any hot pot restaurant in Canada before but I'm told the quality of the food was probably about average.  In any case, I was happy with it.

Cons:
Service.  Going in, I read the service wasn't great but I didn't think it would have affected me so much.  Our server looked annoyed (and I'm not saying this lightly) when we ordered.  So much so that he would sigh and look away as we're trying to remember what we wanted.  In all my dealing with him I always got a sense that I was annoying him and that he did not want any part of serving us.  It was also very difficult to grab someone (anyone!) to order or even get more water.

This place was too pricey for my liking.  If I recall correctly it was $27, plus $2 for weekends, plus $3-8 for any of the non-standard soup bases (which are simply labeled mild, medium, or hot).  You can also choose to add their premium angus beef for another $3 per person.  While the meal was good, I didn't think it was worth $32 plus tax and tip.

Finally, I was upset that they limit you on dessert.  One dessert per person and I think it varies per day/week.  When I went they gave me a choice of vanilla or mango ice cream.  It was a spoonful (not even a scoop) of half-melted ice cream.  I was mortified that they would limit you to ice cream at an AYCE restaurant.

Overall, the food was good but I can't justify paying so much for lousy service and a small portion of dessert.  I'll continue my search for a good hot pot restaurant."}
{"text":"The service was horrible, waited 10 minutes for them to bring us the menu, 10 minutes later they came to take our order ?because i stood up and told them to come?and immediately told us that he is going to answer a phone call first, it was from his sister btw. Yea he ditched servicing our table to answer a personal phone call."}
{"text":"I came here last night with 4 friends and had a decent experience.  
We ordered 2 large pots, which gave us the option to 4 soup base.  We had the satay soup base in both pots, along with this mushroom flavour and corn flavour. (I forgot the exact name) The soup bases were all unique, but the satay is my favourite.  

In terms of the food, they have a very wide selection, including seafood.  But for the price you pay, you shouldn't be expecting any less. The service here is also worth mentioning.  Our waiter was very courteous and friendly, checking up on us often.  All the food came quickly, so we always had food on the table!  

Overall, Morals is an excellent hot pot place with great service.  Although it is a little pricier compared to most, you pay for the quality and well decorated atmosphere."}
{"text":"It was our first time doing hot pot and overall I found it a fun experience. The staff were really friendly and walked us through how the hot pot process works and they had lots of suggestions on what to order. 

When we arrived we entered our info onto an iPad and got a text when our table was ready. The place was packed but we were seated in around 15 mins. 

Our food came really fast and everything we ordered came out together. I tried the original soup base spice level two and it was really hot. I can handle heat but it was a bit too much. My vegetarian friend isn't sure his veggie broth was actually meat-free so heads up to double check. Overall the food was pretty tasty and there were lots of different food bites to try. 

The cost was $40 pp for all you can eat, no upgrades, soup base, drink and tip. We paid cash but weren't told about a 10% cash discount (just noticed that in previous reviewer's comments). In fact their credit machines were down and they only accepted cash."}
{"text":"My favourite part of this hot pot experience was the distinct flavour and tastes of the soup base. The soup base at Morals Village Hot Pot definitely were of a higher caliber than other hot pot restaurants. They import their ingredients for the soup base directly from Chongqing, China! No wonder the taste and flavouring was so strong and unique.  I really enjoyed the sliced lamb and beef as well since it was very fresh and sliced so thinly."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. It's my go-to hot pot restaurant in the area. 

Food - plentiful, diverse and high quality selection of meat, seafood, vegetables and sauces. Must have the deep-fried bun with condensed milk. I like spicy food but I find their broth filled with Szechuan peppers numb my mouth within 5 minutes. 

Service - attentive and quick."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Simply way overcharging for their level of service. It was to my disbelief to hear from several servers that they've ran out of forks or spoons. There was a total of 1 spoon for a party of 5. Even a simple request for a bowl or glass of water requires numerous attempts. Ambiance and food was pretty good but service was simply horrific. We were only served half of the food we ordered and needed to ask at least 3 times from different waiters to receive our order. 
I'd never go back to this restaurant nor would I recommend to anyone. Just to be fair, food quality was fine and the ambiance was nice. Washroom was dirty."}
{"text":"My rating is a 3.5/5 (can't give half a star so sufficed with a 4 star)

Came here on a Saturday night for hot pot. Definitely make a reservation if you can ahead of time. If not, be prepared to wait 30 min +. We came in at 7:30 and was sitted by 8 pm. They do have a \"waiting Area\" with a tv and some chairs for guest who have to wait for their table.

The quality of the items are pretty good compared to other AYCE hot pot places. The fatty beef is very marbled and delicious. Lamb and pork is standard but can tell the quality is higher. Some AYCE hotpot restaurant you can tell the meats have been very frozen but this one was defrosted well.

The wontons and balls were all quite unique, they have their own homemade shrimp paste and fish paste and squid paste. Quite unique. They also have shrimps, mussels and squid included in the hotpot. (some asian ayce require you to pay extra for seafood option) they also have a lot of variety to choose from on the menu.

The only down fall is you have to pay an additional fee for the soup base, whereas most hotpot restaurants have a couple of soup base free of charge with the price of the AYCE. Very unique with the deep fried buns, stick to that and do not touch the spring roll as they were still frozen when you bite into them! Sauce station also has a lot of variety.

Will return again for the quality of the food but not a fan of the price (27$ on weekends + soup base cost + drinks cost) easily came up to a 40$ bill. Oh and also Cash or debit only! So prepare to bring cash."}
{"text":"Love the food here but the service is lacking a little. The food either takes forever to come or it never comes at all. I would also like to mention that the bill does add up, soup bases are separately charged for, pot size is also separate. If you're down to splurge a little I recommend ordering the wagyu beef! Don't forget to try their deep fried buns too, one of my must haves every time I go."}
{"text":"Worst service, and they expect tips? 

Is this sliced lamb?"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last Friday and overall it's whatever. The server we got was really nice and efficient. However, some of the food items might  have been going bad. There was a piece of tofu that looked like there was molding on it and pieces of the wintermelons tasted odd. The beef stomach was also disgusting, it was all rubbery and looked very old and brown. I believe the smallest slices of meat were the pork slices, it didn't look fresh at all, it was all dark and smelt weird. Coincidentally my boyfriend and I both needed to do a #3... so i'm not sure if it was the food or it was just a coincidence. One of the other servers there was very useless. I waved him over to ask for more napkins, he came over, acknowledged me and walked back over to the front counter. Assuming he was going to get the napkins, but turns out he walked back there to chill and drink his water... very weird... Not sure if I feel safe coming back here again. The price they're charging isn't cheap, so I'd at least expect them to serve fresh items...

Mondays to Thursday, the price is $25.99
Fridays to Sundays, add $2.
Broth choice is an additional charge."}
{"text":"Morals village is one of the better hot pots I been to. Their selection of a variety of soups, noodles, and meats/seafood is overwhelmingly awesome. I went with a group of 8 and we had to wait for 30 min because it was busy at night. They served us within 20 min and they brought everything over for us including the sauces. We can increase the heat of the hot pot to our liking. Our table got a the tom yum soup base and spicy soup base (which I recommend for those spicy lovers but a side note would be to take out the dried chilli peppers before eating, as it can increase the spice of the soup when boiled) 

It was a lovely time, the service was great and we had soft served ice cream at the end. The price is roughly 40 per person, give or take. It's well worth the money if you want to eat a selection of meats, veggies, noodles and rice. 

Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good. I love the service here. They are having morning discount which is very cheap. The beverage here are very delicious espeacially the Arctic Ocean ( Beibingyang)  also the wintermelon tea and Hantian Kiwi, they are having professional servers they are fast and clear. The hosts are beautiful."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? high????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Normally, I'm not a fan of hot pot dinners not made at home. Of all the experiences I've had out, this ranks very well ahead of all those I've been to in Toronto. Pretty decent selection, but be sure to make reservations; otherwise, there's going to be a pretty long wait."}
{"text":"How I wish I can give this place 4 stars. But let's start with the positive. The broth we ordered (Pork bone & spicy) very, very flavorful. I can really taste it when I dunk my ingredients in it. I am making this comparison with Made in China hot pot...where it almost tasted diluted/watered down. The meat we ordered: lamb shoulder, rib eye etc were very fresh, you can tell by the color and when you eat it. I was impressed with that! I also ordered pork kidneys, ox stomach which is sort of chewy in an interesting way, tripe and so on. The pork kidneys I wished were bigger cuts, rather than slivers...but it was very tasty. Loved it. The tripe was in small strips, not too memorable. What really sold me was all the meat. Quality, you can tell right away.

Now it's more expensive than most hot pot joints because for 2 people it was roughly 60-70 bucks. But the ingredients were all very fresh and the broth was excellent.

Now about the service. Well to be honest, there wasn't any at all.  We asked for water, the waiter never came by. We asked for napkins, the waiter never came by. It's as if they went into a wormhole, never to be seen or returned once they give you the food. Also, when we went to pay, the cashier was on his cell phone. I had to walk into the kitchen area, flag him, so we could get our bill settled. 

 I get it, the restaurant is busy. However, every restaurant gets busy at some point or the other, they should learn to handle rushes.

I really would come back though, just for the food, which was really good. But I won't expect any service, that's for sure."}
{"text":"This is one of the nicest hot pot places I've been to! I got the pork bone broth and it was great, very flavorful. They have a great selection of ingredients and sauces which were all pretty fresh. I wish they could somehow automate the process by letting us write the order on the paper or use an iPad...it's a pain calling down the staff every time. 

I also greatly enjoyed the soft serve ice cream at the end - great way to end it and it was so refreshing. Expect to wash all your clothes after."}
{"text":"A-OK for food (3 stars), not so okay for service (2 stars). 

From a food quality stand point, pretty good. Ingredients were fresh and you can boil in your own personalized pot with your own soup base. The decor is nice and it's a good option to nearby hotpot joints down the street. Portions come in a manageable size so you're not overwhelmed by \"one serving\". The sauce station is pretty unreal - there's probably over 10 sauces and condiments available for you to mix and match. 

However, all of this is at a cost of $25.99 for AYCE style hot pot, an extra $2.5-8 per person for the soup base, all the while excluding beverages. Overall, the cost structure is a bit steep for hot pot given neighbouring joints charge less and include beverages. 

There were a few instances service was lacking. Firstly, upon arrival the hostess greets us with \"we accept cash only, and if you don't have cash, we have an ATM machine just outside.\" Secondly, we were rushed to start ordering due to a \"two hour seating limit\" even though we just sat down, was early for our reservation, and the rest of our party didn't arrive yet. Thirdly, we didn't have enough cutlery and utensils to start, and servers didn't ask what we wanted to drink (nor did they bother to offer water). 

If I were to choose again, I'd probably just go across the street. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Average wait time is 1h and the food is served slowly.    Have to wait for food all the time.   Food are always missing from orders."}
{"text":"I used to love this place because hot pot places are typically less nice looking, but the quality and service has really gone down.

Heads up: if you want a big table (like 15 people), you have to book their \"room\" and spend a minimum of $500 or something crazy. You might as well reserve two tables side by side to avoid this minimum spend. You'll probably get better service with it anyways.

I also believe they're stopping their points system now. So use up those rewards before they expire the program. 

The spicy soup bases are really numbing here (even the if you pick the 1 pepper bases)! What I normally do is order a more plain soup base, while my dad gets the spicy one, and transfer some of his soup over to mix it myself. 

There are lots of food to choose from, but you have to order it more than once to get it to come out... or to get more than 4 pieces of each. As I said, the quality has changed, so nothing really stands out about this place for me anymore."}
{"text":"Be ready to consume an immoral amount of food. Especially if you end up in a private room. We had to get the VIP room since we had 10 people in our party. To hit minimum spend, we ordered enough watermelon juice to feed a village. Note: minimum spend on these rooms range from $400-500 pre-tax. You can save 10% if you pay with cash. 

You have the option to order your personal pot of soup or if you're feeling a little spicy, you can split a large pot with that special someone. Meat always came last, maybe they were hoping we'd fill up on fish balls and veggies beforehand. Shrimp balls are a must try here. You can also pay additional for premium hot pot items like oysters. 

The drinks are unbearably sweet. If you get the wintermelon lemon tea, I'd recommend diluting it 50/50 with water. It was like drinking liquid syrup. 

I had the pleasure of finding a piece of plastic in my soup, to compensate my group was offered a free jug of watermelon juice. I also had my soup replaced with the wrong broth. 

There's free ice cream at the end of the meal, I personally wasn't a fan since it was grainy and overly sweet and have been told that it isn't as good as before. 

Overall, food was okay. For $50+ per person there are plenty of hot pot options on this street or you could DIY at home, so I won't be coming back unless I was forced to."}
{"text":"If i could, I would rate it 0 star! Because YOU DONT EVEN DESERVE ONE! 

My friends and I, were there to get a seat for a table of 5 at approximately 7:35pm. We got a waitlist #22 . We knew it was busy there so we didnt complain on the ONE HOUR wait. Exactly 1 hour later, we checked the waitlist and we were suppose to be the first one waiting on the waitlist. That means, the next table should be ours! BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO they have decided to give the table to waitlist #24 and #28 ! Because there is 6 hotpot burners on that table and they said that we only have 5 ppl so they are giving it to two groups of 3 ppl! Wtf is that man! WE HAVE WAITED ONE HOUR and no table for us and instead gave it to ppl at the back of the waitlist! REtarded HOST named SILVER cause she does not know how to be a host! They should FIRE her! Name is Silver ! I own a restaurant and this should not happen!!! 

In the end, we complained to her and she still didnt giv us the table so we were very angry and hungry and left the stupid hotpot place. NEVER going to be back again, and if by anychance i did... Thats because IM COMPLAINING TO THE MANAGER!"}
{"text":"stoves are slow. Service is bad. Waiters don't even smile. They close at 11:30pm but they do last call at 10pm and start stacking the chairs on top of the tables. Way to rush the people who are already there eating. Won't be coming back here. Back to warden and steeles' \"Legend Pot\""}
{"text":"Went there today around 7pm, it was Saturday so they were definitely busy. Got seated around 8:15pm. Both food and service were alright. But one thing to keep in mind is that they DON'T take credit card, even though it said that it does on yelp. Also, you get ice-cream after the meal but only one. I was told by the waiter that they charge for extra ice-cream. Which I find a little ridiculous considering the fact that it wasn't stated on the menu, also for the price of 30$/person I think the ice-cream could have been unlimited. But on that note, probably one of the best green-tea ice-cream I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I am here to share the disgusting service I received at this hot pot restaurant. 
The food was not fresh at all. The mushroom they specify on the menu is not consistent with the one they serve us.
We asked about it, trying to make sure we did not get the wrong one. They insist on their stories without any apologizes. 
Such dishonest has proved me and my partner. We simply just want an apologize. 
Plus, the service is awful. Up to 3 things I orders at the beginning never show up on the table until we finished it. The waiters are arrogant and rude who telling lies to their customers without even blinking eyes. Horrible. 
Me and my partner both had a digestion issue at that awful night. The food is clearly expired. 
I am pretty sure I won't visit it again, and will report to the relevant agencies immediately."}
{"text":"The service was good but after the first round of ordering, the service had been slowed and we had to order multiple times and finally our beef came. Our plates where not cleaned after we had clearly finished the round of ordering. We had to flag multiple severs for even just a water refill. 
When we where finished and received our bills after my friend had payed the server pointed out that there was no tip... no tip... loud enough for the other table to hear she still tipped but in cash. The service was poor I would not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect from Morals Village, but I was quite impressed with my visit here. We came tonight. It was a rainy, cold, Tuesday night at 8:30pm. We assumed we wouldn't have to wait, but when we got there, we had to wait for about 15 minutes. 

We were led to a large table where they had placed a divider so that the two of us would have some privacy. I like the divider idea. However, it does mean there's less space on the table to place raw food. When the first waiter took our order, we decided on individual pots, then proceeded in ordering our food and sauces. Just as we finished, while our first waiter was still with us, our food started arriving. That's the fastest service I've ever experienced! I was super impressed. 

The food quality is pretty good. We had the satay soup base and the pork soup base. We preferred the satay, but the pork one was impressive in its own right. It had green onions, goji berries, and other things in it. It wasn't just broth. I appreciate that the lamb, beef, and pork slices were overall less fatty than other hotpot places, in the sense that they did not have large fat layers. I would have preferred more marbling in my meat, but this was not bad at all. 

Some of their English menu items are a tad scientific sounding. I don't know if they have a more English friendly translation. Someone should look into that. Highlights from their menu include king oyster mushrooms (prince mushrooms on their menu), watercress, raw shrimp (fairly large), mussels (also fairly large) on their menu, two kinds of stuffed meatballs (as well as cheese filled beef balls we did not try), and sliced ox tongue. I appreciate that the ox tongue was sliced very thinly. It reheats and becomes tender much quicker this way. The highlight of my night was a fish ball for which I do not know the name. It looked fried and had bits of squid in it. It tasted like fish tofu, but less processed. 

Others have mentioned the ice cream at the end of the meal. It really does make a difference. While the ice cream was slightly gritty, it still went down incredibly smoothly. Great end to a good meal.

On a weekday, it was about $32/person before tip because we got the cheaper soup bases. It's not as cheap as other places, but it's definitely one of the better hot pot places I've been to. I wouldn't mind making a return trip here some time, but not today. After two all-you-can-eats today, I'm down for the count."}
{"text":"I walked in for lunch on a weekday and it was not too busy. The AC was working so it was not hot inside especially at a hot pot place. The meal is slightly more expensive compared to other hot pot restaurants in the area plus there are extras like soup base, special food and drink items.

The food ordered included sliced angus beef / lamb, shrimp, a variety of veggies, dumplings and several seafood balls.  The beef and lamb were excellent with the tomato beef soup based that I picked.The service and the restaurant layout were great. I did not know how bug the restaurant was with several booths plus a few private rooms.

There are tables with individual hot pots and others with shared pots for larger groups. I sat at a table for 2 and each of us had our own pots. I also ordered a large size of their plum juice which was good and not watered down.  I would go again but likely not in the next few weeks as I tend to over eat. 

Note to self: Do not go during lunch and expect not to be able to stay awake."}
{"text":"Maybe some people like this place, but it's just not for me. The pork bone soup here is pretty bad, unlike other locations. Not sure why. I also got the medium spicy broth, which is one of their most popular (or so I've heard), and it was terrible. I could not even taste the food I cooked in my pot over how spicy it was. I can't imagine the highest spicy version. 

The beef and lamb I ordered here was extremely rough and not very tasty. Honestly, the only thing I liked about this place were the fried mini buns with condensed milk. Unfortunately, they don't refill them often so I could only get them once within the 2 hour time limit. 

The service is not that great here and my waitress could not understand half of what I was saying (canto to canto), and they did not bring out everything I ordered. Possibly because of this, but I would assume not since the things she repeated back to me did not show up either. 

If you are interested in coming here, I would highly recommend the Little Sheep Mongolian Hotpot across the street."}
{"text":"The broth was very good. We ordered the spicy broth - one 3 spice level and the other 2. The 3 spice level was too spicy we cannot take it.  To change it, we need to pay for another broth soup. 

The food options were lots and the service was very good. 

We waited for 30 minutes before we get a seat during peak hours - around 7:30pm on a weekend. 

The only thing the price is a lot higher compare to other hot pot restaurants. 

Would definitely go back back again."}
{"text":"We had a pretty good experience here. The service was good and the food quality was on point too. Too bad it's only cash or debit only which is a huge minus for me and somewhat pricy for what it is.

Food: 3/5, good quality and a lot of choices. The beef ribeye were good and the veggies but the balls and other smaller items were just ok.  I also wish they had more sauce choices.

Service: 3/5, on point with attentiveness but at the same time, there weren't a lot of people.  

Ambience, 3/5, great seating and large tables, so with a lot of dishes, you can place your items without crowding.

Price: 1/5, the debit or cash only option is ridiculous and it came to about $40 per person which I'm not sure is good for hotpot.  At the end, it's just buffet so I feel that other places around $25 are better for it."}
{"text":"My third hot pot in Toronto.  I'll just say I've had better.  The ingredients were fine and we had a good time but the service was terrible.  You might as well go to Celebrity Hotpot or something else in the area.

Food: 3/5, the lamb is good and all the dishes come in nicer plates and thin meat that cook easily.  There are many sauces and the broth was good. The food also comes in small portions so order more than you think.

Service: 1/5, this is where they fail a lot.  The ordering setup seems smart at the beginning with the iPads but with so many waiters around, they NEVER come near you. They just stay in the middle area.  It was difficult to get their attention even for 2nd servings.  It also took forever to get water or dessert - we had to walk up to them.  Paying was also a huge hassle as this took another 15-20minutes.

Ambience: 3/5, clean and new-ish look.  The tables were quite comfy and it's not too loud or steamy for hot pot.

Price: 2/5, Not sure $35 + tip is worth it for what we got.  You can eat like kings and good service at other hot pots for at least $10 less than that.  ALSO, they only take cash (very sketchy about that)

Feel free to try the place but I'd probably go somewhere else next time. (one visit only)"}
{"text":"A popular place for good all you can eat hotpot. The restaurant is quite busy. Some of the tables have their own individual stoves per person and others are shared per 2 people. For the inconvenience of not being able to accommodate a table where each person gets their own stove, they give us complimentary plum juice which was nice. This establishment is all you can eat and they have quite the extensive menu with different kinds of meat, veggies and other proteins. We ordered a bunch of everything from beef, lamb, mussels, an assortment of meat balls, mussels, quail eggs, veggies and much more. They have their own sauce station so you get to make your own customized sauces. You also get to choose your own hotpot base. I ordered the satay sauce base which was delicious. The food came out very quickly and we enjoyed quite the feast with 6 guys. There wasn't really a time limit at the restaurant as we literally sat for a good 3 hours. After we finished eating dinner, we got this delicious chocolate soft served ice cream which was a nice touch after eating so much good food! My only criticism is that their customer service is just mediocre. Our waiter was good and I always felt bad that we had to keep asking stuff but he really. The other staff here seemed very less inclined to come and help us. They only accept debit and cash here so keep that in mind!! The language barrier with patrons and waiters is a bit of a problem. English is clearly not their first language. Overall, I was completely stuffed after enjoying such a great meal. Definitely will be back here for sure despite the minor inconveniences!!"}
{"text":"When I walked in, there was an iPad reservation system: put in your phone # and they'll text you when a table's available. On a friday evening (holiday) ~6pm, there was about a 15 minute wait for 2 people.

When we were ordering, the waiters told us that we weren't allowed to order a large pot to share, which wasn't the case at the Markham location. I'm guessing that's it's due to the layout of the conductors on the table which pre-determined that we could only order individual pots. The Markham location had more of an open-concept, so there was more flexibility in choosing whether we can share or have individual hot-pots. I wish they'd inform us before sitting down about this, though.

Soup base: 
 I've tried sweet corn, pork bone, tomato, and the spicy soup bases, but my absolute favourite is the mushroom. Even though I load up the sauces, I barely have to use it because there's so much tasty flavour that the food absorbs from the broth.

Service:
The service here is phenomenal. The waiter responded right away when he noticed that I was looking at the menu or that the table was clear and would ask us whether we'd like to order more dishes. At one point, I wanted more green onions from the self-serve sauce station, but it was empty, and told the waiter about it. He went beyond just notifying us that it was refilled, but brought a bowl of it to our table. 

Food:
The deep fried milk buns are so good, especially when they refill it fresh from the kitchen.
The beef and lamb are thinly sliced, and always taste fresh. Cheesy beef balls, hand pulled noodles, and crystal yam noodles are really good too.

The soft serve is a great way to end the meal and also included. I like vanilla and chocolate, but not so much the matcha, which appears more brown than green.

Whenever I go to Moral's Village, I always have a great experience but I only go once in awhile because it can get quite pricey at ~$40/person

**They only take debit/cash, NO credit"}
{"text":"This is a large hotpot chain originated from China, the service at this location is great, a lot better than the Markham location. It is a cool it your self type of dining, basically you pick your soup base and then put thinly sliced meats and other food in it until it's cooked. You make your own dipping sauce from a variety of condiments such as soy sauce, vinegar, oyster sauce, haisin sauce etc. They offer both single serve (per person) and larger pot (shared). Foods are fresh, and the restaurant is pretty clean. The only weird thing is that the stairs leading to it is very high and steep."}
{"text":"Morals Village is my go to hotpot spot in downtown Toronto. The quality of the ingredients is amazing starting with the meat: great marbling on the beef, neat slices for the lamb and a good combination of lean and fat for the pork. Their seafood is delicious as well, highlights include the tiger prawn balls (so juicy and flavourful), the hong kong style wontons (yet again filled with such a juicy flavourful shrimp filling, the fresh shrimp and calamari balls (nice and chewy with large pieces of seafood). Vegetables are fresh and cleaned properly. 

The price is bit a on the higher end but the quality is also on the higher end as well. Out of all the soup bases, my favourite is the pork bone one! Service is a hit or miss like other yelpers have pointed out but we've never had too too much trouble with service apart from the occasional dish or two that wasn't brought out."}
{"text":"We came here on a snowy afternoon so it was perfect for hotpot. They have a good selection of soup bases to choose from which is awesome as some other places I've been to have very limited options.

Once you've chosen your soup base you can order your food items from the waiter who is equipped with a tablet to take your order.
The selection of items to choose from is broad and the ingredients are pretty fresh. As with other hot pot places they forgot to bring some items that we ordered several times. We asked for multiple portions of items but they seem to always give us one serving. The worst was the lamb and beef which seemed to get less and less each additional plate we ordered.
My favourite items were the wonton, Spicy beef balls, the Taiwan tempura, and the ice cream for dessert.

Oh also don't forget to get your sauce from the sauce station. Lots of choices so there's bound to be something you'll like.

I would recommend this place as food and service was good as they came to refill our pots often and checked in to see if we needed more food. One more thing to note is that they only take debit or cash in case that affects your decision in any way."}
{"text":"Hotpot is one of my favorites!!!! This place has one of the BEST quality of food and offers a variety of side orders. I love spicy stuff and this place offers a variety of spicy base options. I love their drink menu from the fresh watermelon juice to wintermelon jars. Absolutely great! Will definitely come back as a regular! Best eaten in the Winter!"}
{"text":"Very good service and variety of foods you can get from what you paid for. If you want a decent hotspot experience, this place will satisfy you"}
{"text":"The first and the best hotpod experience!
Very good customer service.
Server always brings paper towels every time she sees me having running nose from spices.
Dessert is included to all you can eat so you can rest your mouth with it after hefty amount of spicyness (in good way)"}
{"text":"New renovation, beef and lamb are excellent. Must try. However it's pretty pricy especially for Weekend. $2 extra, and soup is extra cost too For the hotpot. For two people you are looking at 80$+. Also they don't take credit card, make sure you bring enough cash or have enough funds in your debit."}
{"text":"Food was fresh with a wide variety. The servers were also very attentive. Be forewarned though, it is cash only :)"}
{"text":"The best hotpot in Toronto! Good quality of food, good service, and tidy environment! A bit pricey but totally worth spending on it."}
{"text":"Very authentic Chinese hot pot experience. Their selling point is the broth - it's wholly made of butter. Mala spicy broth a must try. Ingredients are fresh but individuals portions tiny.(doesn't matter since it's all you can eat). Minimum spend of ~$35 to get a booth VIP seat, but 'normal seats' are not bad. 2 hour limit not enforced, but they do take last orders around 45mins before closing time. Dessert usually soft serve. I'd recommend having more beef and less other meats."}
{"text":"It's expensive but not that good. And the service is really bad, when we payed the bill, the waitress counted money just in front of us for twice! What a rude behavior."}
{"text":"2.9/5
I would give them 3.8(which is pretty rare for me) if the service was any decent but holy mackerel, it's the WORST. Worst than any restaurant I ever been. 

Before I start with service, I'll say food was pretty decent for what you can get around this neighbourhood. Yes, they extra charge you for the soup base but, it's way flavourful than a lot of hotpot places I experienced in this neighbourhood so I'm not going to complain about it. They do have limited variety of ingredients but meat is fresher than what you can get around here. Also they have beef tongue! Big Plus point for that. But I wasn't pleased with their seafood. I went there in cold winter but seafood are in a pretty bad condition. I could taste bad smell of old sea from both shrimp based ingredients and fish. ( Imagine what would it be like during summer! Eww)

Now the service...  Let's be honest here. These guys aren't cheap like any other Chinese restaurants around here. They are trying to be upscale Chinese hotpot restaurant. And I'm expecting them to deliver the decent service as well. If anyone want to say \"but it's Chinese restaurant..\" talk, let me tell you something. I went to up town location. They were also extremely busy like this place but I received fairly attentive service from my server & bussers. They didn't give me any smile or made small talk with me but they keep on checking at my table whenever I do need them and successfully deliver the 90% of my order. 

Now..  Unlike their uptown location, I was sitted at my table by sweet but not so sure about how to deal with customer, hostess, and was abandoned at the table for 15 mins! My friend had to flag down multiple busssers & hostess to get our server. Not to mention that they never offer the water. Anyway, we got help from a server with a little bit of attitude to start our meal.  Hotpot arrived and veggies arrived, but where are my meat? Seafood? Nothing arrived after veggie ingredients for another +15 mins. I mean its like we been sitting at table for half an hr with no real food to eat cause no one start their hotpot with veggies. I mean come on. Even my very chill and patient friend was starting to getting bothered by this. After few more struggle to flagging down the server, we finally got our food. It was fairly enjoyable. There are few issues with portion of ingredients(Only one or two piece of meat & veggie arrived while it should been 4 pieces ) and we only received 70% of our order. Oh did I mention about how I enjoy making additional order? it's almost impossible to get an attention from our sassy server after the first order. We asked bussers to help us to get the servers attention, but they either pretty much ignore you or tell you that you need server for whatever you need. It's like the server who is supposed to take care of your need entire dining experience is unreachable like a rare Pokemon! After a long struggle with horrible service, we finally managed to finish the dinner. Again, it's impossible to get the bill. Waited for another 15 mins or so to get a bill and pay. This explains why I had to wait for an hour to be sitted even tho there weren't many ppl ahead of me.

Will I be back? I'm not sure. Will I recommend this place to others? I'm also not sure. They seriously need to work on their system and quality check for ingredients, and than maybe I'll give them another chance.."}
{"text":"The mushroom soup base is my favourite!! Nice food! Nice service! Definitely come back"}
{"text":"A few issues with this place.

from the outside, the place looks modern and clean. 

First, they do not cater to those who do not read chinese. 

We were seated with an english menu and every price on the menu was scratched out, nor do they bother to explain anything..like oh i dunno, how much per person it is, that broths are extra charges (those might be important to the average diner). I had to inquire about this, and the server told us that's the old menu, and the new menu is only in chinese. So my first question is, why can't they update both menus and why are the old menus still circulating?

i also had to get another server to explain all the new items on the chinese menu that were not indicated on our old menu...which might have seemed a little tedious, but i felt like it was not fair since i didn't read chinese.

The service was not that great. I would say about 60% of our orders showed up properly if they even showed up at all. Not sure if it was a language barrier, or missed on the back end, but we had to re-order things 3 times before they came....and some just never came.

I prefer mixing my own sauces, and don't like having to order each sauce individually. The food quality was not bad, but i would much prefer Little Sheep to this place."}
{"text":"Best hot pot in Markham for it's quality. This is definitely my go-to place for hot pot. They have a vast selection of sauces, soup base, and food options to choose from. It's lively and clean environment, with good ventilation which doesn't leave you smelling after the meal. Although a little more expensive than other hot pot places, it makes up for it in it's food and ambience."}
{"text":"Really had higher expectations for this place. I was originally going to give them a 2 star 'cause their service was just really a disappointment. 

I made reservations for a group of 9 during on a Saturday night when they had their anniversary promo (30% off promo). Our server lacked speaking English so it was quite difficult to communicate with him and sometimes the wrong order would come out. On top of that it was just really annoying when whenever we order a certain item (eg. 6 orders of watercress), the person bringing out the food would almost never bring out the how much of what we ordered. When we told them that we ordered 6, the person who brought it out just kept nodding his head and saying \"no no no\" and bring like 2 orders out. Maybe they didn't want us to waste food, which I totally understand but that just meant that we literally had to order every time our server came cause our table wanted more watercress LOL. 

The dessert, soft serve matcha or vanilla ice cream was the highlight of our dinner. It actually tasted really good. Not sure if it was suppose to be one per person but when I asked the server if I could have another one, he said yes. 

Overall, it's just really annoying. I don't know if I'll be back though. I think I would prefer going to a place where I can get up and pick and choose my own food."}
{"text":"I returned to Morals Village after a personal invitation, and this time I brought Steven who is a big hot pot critic (he firmly believes that we can make hot pot at home so there is not much point in eating hot pot out). He was impressed from our visit and so we bumped the rating up.

Things that are different from my previous reviews:
1. This time for soup base we had the satay soup base and the original spicy soup base. IMO the original spicy soup base tastes exactly like their 10-year special spicy one; but it's cheaper than the 10-year one lol. The satay soup base was tasty too, Steven liked it.
2. The quality of the food we had this time was a lot more like the first time I came here; fresh and high quality. (To ensure we're not biased since we may have gotten preferential treatment this visit, we looked around at other tables too and they all seemed to have fresh meat.) I'm happy to see that they have addressed the food freshness issue I mentioned in the previous review. Steven really liked the food here, he said he would rate the taste here 9/10. He liked a lot of the home made balls and other stuff. 
3. They are more organized this time and a lot more attentive to us. Big improvement from before, especially since they tend to get very busy around dinner time. Soup and water was refilled without being asked, and our server was very diligent in coming over to ask if we wanted to order more when our table was empty.
4. Things that we would recommend: tender marinated pork, various homemade balls, squid paste, fresh cuttlefish, tiger shrimp balls, and fried bun with condensed milk (this is self serve at the sauce station).

Would go back? If any of our friends want hot pot, sure.

Would recommend to friend? If they like hot pot, yes."}
{"text":"I expected the beef to be more fresh and to have more fatty in the beef (Although this may be a personal preference). 
I think there should be more assortment of vegetables on the menu.

On the positive note, the interior was nice and the place is very clean. 
Service was great, our waiter came back to check on us in good intervals. Since it was AYCE, it was very convenient for us not having to flag someone down all the time."}
{"text":"What a great spot for hot pot! I came here with 5 other people on a Tuesday afternoon. I originally made reservations for 1PM, however my friends and I got there early and they were totally fine with accommodating us at an earlier time. 

They selection they have to offer is pretty great. You have a variety of different soup bases, veggies, meats and toppings to choose from. My favorites are the square tofu, chaozhou stuffed fishballs + meatballs and enokitake (these suck up the flavor of the soup really nicely!) Their soft-serve green tea ice cream was also pretty bomb!

Service was great and the restaurant is very clean. I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"The spicy soup base with 4 stars is amazing! Love the sauce station and the food. 
Meat comes out slow and when we asked for the meat we already ordered, the waiter place another order, at the end, we had 3 more plates than we ordered. 
Some stuff like the shrimp paste, ordered, but didn't get. 
Icecream is very good, but only limit to one per person."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.

I got the original spicy soup base, asked for mild and was alarmed to see a thick THICK! film of chili oil. There was an abundance of peppercorn and chili bits floating in the soup base and I spent a long time picking them off my food. They should use a mesh ball to contain the spices, or strain the soup before serving. But to be fair, the selection of meats and vegetables was good and the food was fresh. Also, good presentation.   

Service was efficient enough, and perfunctory. I don't expect much more from an AYCE restaurant. I did expect to be able to write down our orders or better yet, use tablets, but there was just the server jotting everything down.  

Dessert was impressive - soft serve green tea (or vanilla) ice cream. On second thought, it was more the novelty of the idea that was impressive. One cone per customer, usually.  

At the end of the meal, my individual tab came to about $40 after taxes and tips. For this price and the amount of peppercorn I ingested, I don't think I'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday at 7PM on their day  one of their anniversary celebration. They advertised that they will be offering everyone 30% off, $5 gift card and a chance at winning a $500 prize.  Came here with 7 friends and initially they offered to give us a table for 6 people which we were reluctant to take so then they offered us their private vip room at no extra cost.  At first the service was good with most of what we ordered arriving in a timely manner.  But then they started to check up on us less and many items that we ordered did not arrive.  When the food did arrive, there were many items I had to just dump the whole dish into the pot because it was still frozen together.  The last item we ordered was ice cream and it took over 30 min to get even after asking 3 different waiters on the status of it.  Once it finally arrived the ice cream had a weird taste to it and was very grainy.  Rather than waste more time waiting for the bill we decided to go to the cashier to pay it there.  In order to get the $5 gift card we had to ask for it.  They only gave us 2 even though we were a group of 8.  Will definitely not be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Good variety of foods and soup ($2.5-$3 each). You can really taste the soup flavor in the meat - don't need to dip sauce. I like the corn best; also tried sa cha, tomato, and variety of their famous spicy broths. 

Modern interior, nice wood mix. Service could be better but don't expect much. Made a reservation but still had to wait 20+ minutes. The place is super packed.

Also for drinks, it's $6 for a pitcher (got sour plum and wintermelon) which serves about 4...  I can drink the whole thing myself."}
{"text":"This place has the worse service ever!!! Server called silver was sooooo rude. Honestly I know it's Friday night and it's busy so we didn't complain about the 1 hour wait time, however when we waited for one hour and you did not give us seat but to other people who came after us simply because we have 5 people and the table you have open is for 6 which you guys didn't want to waste the extra space, therefore gave it away to the people who came after us 3x and 3x. How ridiculous is that! We were starving and waited one hour and this is the service we get! So rude'! Never going back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad Morals Village opened in downtown! It's a great all you can eat hot pot option with many options. 
It was quite crowded during the weekend. But they have a good reservation system in place. You can just get a number from the iPad in front of the restaurant, and they will text or call when your seat is ready. This gives a lot of flexibility. 
The all you can eat menu include delicious meat, many vegetables and sides. My favorites are the lamb, bamboo shoot, tong hao and all the mushrooms! A soft serve ice cream is included at the end of the meal as dessert. 
Unfortunately drinks and many other fancier options are extra. But it's still a good value for what's available on the menu. 
The soup also tastes great. Love the spicy options!"}
{"text":"Glad we tried this spot,  kitchen was fast and food was of good quality and price.  We will certainly come back again."}
{"text":"For US customers: they don't accept US debit card, US dollar, and any type of credit card! Although we paid with credit card twice with no problem in last three weeks, this time they just didn't accept it. They didn't even accept US dollars. If you don't have enough cash with you and don't want to bother using the paid ATM outside, don't go!
Food was okay. Can't complain for service. But I'm sure there're tons of nice hot pot restaurants who would accept credit card, which makes life much easier!"}
{"text":"A long strenuous day at work deserves a warm hot meal to finish the night away; hot pot is always the perfect choice. Normally I would rarely stray away from my usual favorite restaurants. But today I was unexpectedly compelled to roam into new territories. So, on this cold evening, right before the sun set, when the air was still and silent, I ventured to Morals Village. 

I met with my parents and brother at the restaurant front. Upon entering the restaurant, a strong aroma of hot pot soup filled our noises with joy. My mouth watered in excitement, as I expected great food and service.

The decor was warm and welcoming. The wooden walls with lamps hanging from above mixed with neon lights (not exactly the name, not sure what it's called), creates a modernized feel. The atmosphere and sound level is loud but cozy. 

A waitress led us to our table and handed out 2 menus. Curse my luck! The menu we received was written in Chinese. And all the waiters and waitresses spoke Mandarin. With my eternally awful Cantonese and non-existent Mandarin skills, I am utterly confused. Fortunately, a waitress gave us two English menus for my brother and me. And my mom translated and communicated with the waitress. Whew!

I carefully perused the menu, choosing items that satisfied my perpetual hunger. My two soup bases were: satay on the left side and clear broth on the right. We ordered a myriad of items, consisting of- beef slices, udon,  water cress, instant noodles, sausage, mussels, pig blood curd, shrimp, tofu, and many more. FYI: I'm listing the items we ordered. I did not eat all the items aforementioned.

The soup bases both tasted delicious . The satay soup was not spicy. But added flavor to any items cooked in the broth. The clear broth complimented well with the satay soup. However, the soups were not mind blowing, staying within the same chapters of its contemporaries.

The udon noodles were delicious. I carefully devoured each noodle placed in between my chopsticks and bowl. Each noodle soaked up the flavors of the spicy satay soup. Add in the beef slices and the dish is complete. Despite my praise, the texture of the noodles was too soft (subjective opinion).

Hot pot itself is already a dinner set to be amazing and delicious. But include instant noodles onto the menu, cooked in the broth, is a dinner made from heaven. I set my eyes carefully on the instant noodles, waiting for the three minutes to end. Once cooked to my personal preference, I poured the noodles into my eating bowl and some soup to top off everything. I gazed upon the beauty that sat in front of me, enthralled by such a wonderful dish. I picked on my chopsticks on my right side, readying myself for a battle. Right away, I began slurping the noodles down my mouth, like a mad Barbarian. 

The instant noodles, like the udon, infused all the flavors of the broth. The texture is what you'd expect from any instant noodle pack. Was the instant noodles delicious with the hot pot? Absolutely. Will I order it again? I ordered two more before I ate my third bite.

The service is a wee bit slow. Many items were late to arrive to our table. The waiter and waitresses were a bit unresponsive.

Maybe not the adventure I expected to be. Morals Village is not a great restaurant. Will I return? Perhaps, if my hunger beckons me to visit again. But for now, I think I will stick to my usual hot pot place (personal preference)."}
{"text":"MUST TRY:
lamb
fish filet (sea bass)
handmade fish balls

Good:
fungus
beef
special meats
assorted balls

Had the Original & Satay broths. They were good, but not any better than other hot pot establishments.

The music is absolutely terrible. Prepare to hear some songs which make your ears bleed.

The lighting on some of the tables consists of a hanging bulb that shines right in your face. I hated it. Thankfully, they can move it a bit so that it's not right in your eye.

Service was very fast for most of the meal, but it took several minutes to place our initial order from our table.

Overall, I like Moral's Village. I'm not sure it's worth paying a premium for unless your love fish balls, or another specialty item which you can't get elsewhere"}
{"text":"After having spent my entire life eating hot pot at home, this was the very first time for me at a hot pot restaurant.  We were there on a Sunday evening, the place was packed!  The servers were friendly and helpful, I had tons of questions seeing as it was my friend time.  My friend's been to a few before and mentioned that this is one of the pricier ones.  The food was fresh and were served promptly.  The sauce table was of good variety, although I feel like they've missed out on some traditional sauces.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"There are many all-you-can-eat Chinese Hot Pot places in Markham,but Moral Village is the best one so far!!! Just with an acceptable price, you can enjoy delicous soupbases, non stoppable lambs and beef, and all other fresh hot pot food as much as you want!!! Excellent services! All servers threat customer with great great attitudes. This place sure brings customer satisifcation! We went there and waited 1 hour long because Moral Village is so popular, but at the end it was worth it."}
{"text":"I give this place a 3.5/5. I came here with a friend on a Saturday evening, at 5:30pm, as they do not take reservations for 2. The restaurant was already pretty full. The restaurant is spacious, modern and from what I can tell, clean. The service was average, and the reason I am docking a star. The waitress was incredibly unenthused when taking our orders. At the same time though, she checked in at regular intervals to see if we wanted to order more food, which is good for an AYCE. When our soup bases arrived, our hot plates were not turned on... Nor were we offered any assistance. There are different prices depending on the soup base, which I have not encountered before at other hot pot restaurants so -0.5 star for that. I opted for HK satay style, which was savoury and delicious. For a two person table, we were not allowed to order the split soup base... Sure, ok... They should list that in the menu then.  The food we offered came out promptly, and was very fresh. There is also a large selection of food to choose from, mostly classic hot pot fare. The beef, shrimp and Japanese crab meat were my favourite. +1 for thinly sliced, easy to cook daikon and offering taro! There is a two hour limit that was strictly adhered to on a Sat night. We were promptly told there are others waiting for a table when we hit the 2 hour mark and paid our bill. I would come back here when I'm really hungry and not catching up with a friend, because we certainly did not get our money's worth ($27.99 plus tax on weekend)... Spent a lot of time chatting, and not enough eating!!"}
{"text":"From the beginning of the meal to the end I found this place to be repulsive, I initially came here because I was recommended to it from a close friend. Maybe it was the day I came but probably wouldn't ever return to this spot because of the sanitation issues. Place is dirty and had actually crawling with cockroaches where I was sitting. Disgusting! Food quality is that of near by hotpots, if not less. 

These guys charge you extra for just about everything. The broth I wanted to choose was a the wild mushroom broth mixed pot with their house spicy. I couldn't do that combination without having a larger pot and was charged an extra $9?! 

I wasn't able to be seated at a larger table for me and my girlfriend and was crammed by the tables with metal grates which was full of dust. Next thing you know a live cockroach comes crawling under my napkin. The Sauce stand was pretty non-existent barely filled and a majority of them having a crusty layer of the sauce around the rim of the sauces. 

Our meal ended up coming to being about $90 for two people. 

I Recommend take your money to other hotpots in the area."}
{"text":"Long overdue review on this place. Went to try this place out over the Christmas holidays since I heard pretty good things about this place. 

Went in at 6 o'clock which I thought was pretty early and already it was packed. Assuming it was during holidays so figured it's busier than normal. The decor is very modern and bright compared to alot of other hot pot places. 

There's plentiful of choice and selection off the menu and their drinks are pretty neat as well, quite different from other traditional pot pot places where you can only choose from pop, or pear drink. 

Got a split of two soup bases, one tomato vegetable soup and one spicy. We tried out just mild for the spicy soup and good thing only 2 peppers because it was really spicy! AHHH! Cant imagine if I had gotten 3 peppers.... 

Lots of meat choices,veggies and seafood as well. Service was pretty quick and attentative in responding to our requests in getting more food and clearing the table of finished bowls and plates. 

This place is a bit more pricey than other hot pot's but definitely I feel you get a bit more from this place and the quality of the items on their menu is better than most. Good place to try out."}
{"text":"Service is bad. There is literally no waiters in the restaurant. Our order never comes out fully. This restaurant needs to be on kitchen nightmare."}
{"text":"I don't know what kind of morals we need to enter this place, but if we're talking about good service I definitely didn't receive it here. If we're talking about customers' consideration of other customers, I also didn't receive it here. Also, a village? I appreciate the open concept, but it definitely has no village feel.

With that aside...

This restaurant was very busy on a Tuesday night. In fact, I think many of the people came from the condos, cause a lot were wearing PJs and slippers! I had to wait about 20 minutes for a table at 9pm (they close at midnight by the way). They also work very slow, so don't expect quick efficient cleanup of tables and turnaround; I took 90 minutes to finish my meal, and I was only a table of  two.

One issue I found with the menu is they don't have an immediate English translation. I assume you have to ask for it, but not every single Asian can read Chinese, let alone simplified Chinese. Good thing my dad does so I just took his word on what's good or not.

The hot pots are individual sized, which I like cause it prevents spillage of soup to the other side. The broth was also flavourful throughout the whole duration even after water was added. Some items I enjoyed include the octopus, pork, lamb, cheese meatballs (yes they have that), beef tripe, and pork balls. A major item that disappointed me was the beef; even if you dip it in the hot pot for 5 seconds the meat goes too hard and tough, and I agree with Cherie F. that there simply isn't enough fat in the beef.

The ice cream was standard; nothing to write home about but good enough to balance the salt-sugar content.

I won't bother much with this place unless I don't wanna venture into Richmond Hill for good hot pot. Although winter is coming, which means expect a lot more hot pot visits."}
{"text":"It's such a decent place and so frikken expensive. You better save your $ and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I been this  hot pot restaurant a lot of times, first of all, the food is absolutely perfect, when we order with service, the bottom of the pot and meat have been sent up ahead of time, every time Morals village let me have a surprise. Beef and lamp are freshly cut, very tender, I usually choose a pot  is corn or tomatoes, sweet and tasty! Service is the best, I have been to wait time was short, and the service is very careful, once a friend and I go to this restaurant, the service asked us have any allergies or dislike, how considerate! once again my girlfriend and I wear white clothes, the manager let us also specially to paper towel to prevent dirty our clothes, just like a home , so warmly!Morals village has become the place where I will go to time and time again! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Bad service usually wouldn't make me hate a resto if their food is not stomach-curdling and I'm still decently satisfied after my meal.  I'd come back again in hopes of a more pleasant server next time.

Morals Village though... this is some next level service.  I mean, I've waited more than 45min for restaurants that don't take reservations.. back when Guu first opened, pretty sure it was a more than one hour wait.  At least in the end when we finally got to sit down at the tables, we received great service and even more superb food. 

Morals Village?  My party of 5 was already starving after waiting an hour when we were told the waiting time would only be 20min.  But what really killed this resto for me is the fact that the table sizing situation got priority over the # we were assigned (which was 22) - and #24 and 28 got to sit before us just because their party size was smaller and more flexible.  Fine, it was our fault for not making a reservation on a Friday night.  But did the waitress have to give that much attitude in telling us that the people that came after our party are getting tables before us?

I've heard good things about this resto as it's supposedly one of the better hotpot places in Toronto, but wow.  a) Not coming back here for the next year b) Not coming back here without a reservation ever"}
{"text":"Never having had hot pot before, I had no frame of reference. Also, I suspect I was at a Huge Advantage having a Chinese host and arriving mid afternoon on a warm June day: almost no one else was in the establishment.

My host ordered a HUGE assortment, and it all appeared very quickly. She then proceeded to give hot pot lessons, helping at the dip bar prepare the most authentic brew. Really, without someone who was familiar with the whole experience, I may have been very.unhappy. The essence is simple: order a soup base, and then boil it at the table while adding an assortment of ingredients, eating the cooked additions at your leisure. Very casual and intimate experience.

Come hungry, and take your time."}
{"text":"3.5/5 

I came here with 6 other friends last night and we were quite disappointed with the service. We arrived at 8pm and didn't get seated until 9:15pm even though most of tables who arrived after us were already seated. To be fair, they did say that we had to wait longer because we were a larger group (still sucked though because we were all starving). 

We ordered right after getting seated - I got the tomato ox soup base as well as the pork bone soup base. I think it's a couple dollars extra per soup. Their drinks also cost extra - FYI most hot pot places come with one complimentary soup base and free drinks (pop, a few Asian drinks, etc.). I split a watermelon juice with a few other friends and that tasted mediocre. As I mentioned before, we weren't very happy with the service here - we had to ask for water 3 times before it came, our soups were only refilled once and that was towards the end of our meal, and no one really came to check up on us throughout the meal. 

Alright, ranting aside, the selection of food here was quite impressive. I'm not even sure what we ended up ordering because they just brought out a whole bunch of stuff. One good thing about this place is that they don't charge you extra for the good stuff (aka seafood). Their food came out within minutes and everything tasted very fresh. 

All in all, Morals is a good place to eat if you are a fan of hotpot and don't mind a wait/subpar service. The atmosphere here is also very fun and it is nicely decorated."}
{"text":"Food is okay... Actually not really..

For the price they charge, the food is just so so...

I would rather go elsewhere and pay less for the same food.. Service wasn't that great either..

But I see these rich Asian kids pulling up in exotic Cars all the time with a few girls and they all seem to think the food is amazing lol

Place did a good job marketing! All my wealthy Asian friends seems to want to check his place out and they always suggest this place for hot pot..

In my opinion, home-made hot pot is the best, unless if a restaurant has something unique and/or special, which this place doesn't.."}
{"text":"The food here is sooooooo good, and the ingredients are super fresh. The soup base is unique and delicious, even the sides are so good. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"One of the best hotspot places in Toronto. Pricier than other places but I think it's worth it. Be careful because the soup base price is actually additional charge."}
{"text":"Didnt have reservations, so we waited about 30 minutes for a table for 5. They gave us a giant booth and we all got our own pots. The table was very convenient to hold all the food we ordered, but difficult to have a conversation without yelling. 

The soup bases were very good and definitely better than the soup bases at other hot pot restaurants in Toronto. The overall food quality is pretty good, especially for an asian hot pot place. 

My two main knocks on this place: 
1 - They don't seem to care about the quantities you order. If you order multiple plates of beef, you still only get a couple of plates and you have to re-order.  It's annoying to not know if anything else from what you ordered is coming. 

2 - there are random charges that add up. They show a base price of $26, + an extra $2 for weekends (which is pretty common  for AYCE places), + $3-8 for a soup base. Most other hot pot places charge extra for soup upgrades, but this place seems to charge for soup itself. Which really makes the base price be $26+$3 = $29. I rather they show it included than to charge me for soup. I wouldn't mind paying it as part of the base price, but felt misled to pay on top of the base price. More of a presentation issue than a price issue - just rubs me the wrong way because how can you hot pot without the soup? Just seems like a sketchy strategy to generate revenue without \"increasing\" the base price."}
{"text":"You pay for the food, definitely not the service. 

We were a party of 15, went for dinner on Saturday night with a reservation for 7pm. The previous party took longer to leave, it also took them about 15 minutes to clear and set the table, so we started trying to get seated around 7:40. Trying - because there were not enough chairs for everyone. We has to track down servers to bring more chairs since the ones without chairs were standing in front of the table waiting for a while for any server to notice. 

We had maybe 6 menus at our table of 15, half of them in Chinese which majority of the party cannot read. We had one server who was nice enough to take our orders but we had to explain how to order to everyone. Nobody explained how the pot heater controllers worked so we had to figure out which controller was for which set. 

The dipping sauce took a really long time to come. Food was cooked but we had for wait for the dipping sauce. When they came, the waiter dumped the tray of dipping sauces on a folding table behind us and tried to leave, without giving each person what they ordered or explaining what is what. 

We ordered drinks which took maybe 20min to come... Curious since we ordered plum drink or wintermelon drink that came in jugs. You'd think itd be quick since all you do is pour and add ice. 

The food is good quality and fresh, so I think you really are paying just for the food and not the service. The servers seem young and not trained at what they do - the Resto is busy and the whole eating experience is confusing and chaotic. I may have preferred the help yourself type of hot pot afterall since you get what you want, when you want it."}
{"text":"Went to Morals Village restaurant for a hot pot meal. This is the first time I ever have a hot pot dinner.

Morals Village is a large restaurant that is crowded with many Asians kids. The booth we were given was very small and cramped.

My friend ordered for us since I did not understand Chinese. We got two pots full of stock. One was spicy while the other was night. We were given items such as pork, dumplings, shrimp, etc that you cook in the boiling stock pots.

I found it was difficult to cook the food. Some was overcooked while other was undercooked. I think I would prefer to eat in a restaurant where the chefs prepared the food.

The restaurant does not take credit cards, but cash and debit cards."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant that I ever been. The meat and the vegetables are really fresh. The service was really nice and patient since this is the first time I went there and he introduced so many good stuffs. The watermelon juice surprise me, it's soooooo good. The meat quality is good and the service is quick, they have a wide selection of the food. I was also very  impressed with the service, he checking on us often. I would like to go to this place again and again and I really love it!!"}
{"text":"This place is very good?The service here is great, I come to eat everyday. I like to eat the tomato flavor soup base and the Ten years Moral village ! The meat here is great you can even taste wagyue beef here, the beef here is smooth, the ox tongue here is also very fresh and delicious! It is very smart for them to pre-cooked the ox tongue makes it a different feeling than the raw one! The self making beverages are great, especially the watermelon juice, it is made by the fresh watermelon!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the restaurant offered a wonderful selection of fresh and good quality food... What made me give this place 2 stars was the service. We came during lunch time on a weekend and paid $28 + the price of the soup base per person. Definitely on the pricier side for lunch so I had  pretty high expectations. We ordered our food and nothing came out for 40 mins. We awkwardly waited at out tables and politely asked them about our order, 0 apologies from our server and still nothing came out. This was incredibly infuriating because you can only eat for 2 hours. Considering the lunch price is the same as the dinner price, I expected them to be fully stocked. We left hungry and disappointed, definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best hotpot place I have ever been.  The setting and decoration is very beautiful and the servers are very friendly and helpful. My girlfriend is not usually a hot pot lover,  but with the great vareity of selection of food and hotpot base this place offered,  she is loving it.  Definately a 5 star!"}
{"text":"I went to Morals Village on a Sunday night for hot pot, after having visited their Markham location a couple times. 

I'd have to say that this location is far superior mostly due to the service. 

We had a waiter named Ryan who provided excellent, attentive service. He tried to make the most out of our experience by suggesting menu items that we had never tried before. When we told him that we really liked one of the items, he continuously followed up with us to ask if we wanted to order more - a true example of anticipatory service. 

As an FYI, this location is slightly different from their Markham one. The sauces and spring rolls are self-serve, which we were a little hesitant about, since there was no glass sneeze guard. However, the ambience is great. There is exposed brick which makes it a bit more hip vs the Markham location. Also, the staff speak great English and Cantonese, which my group found particularly useful (the staff at the Markham location mostly speak Mandarin). 

Overall, I would certainly return! Thanks to Ryan for a great meal and a fantastic customer service experience."}
{"text":"Morals Village is a large energetic hot pot restaurant on Dundas W near Spadina. Seating is comfortable and it's very busy. Quality of the food was very good and there are several choices of broth. Service is attentive but a little disorganized. Nice selection of non alcoholic drinks. Reservations are a good idea especially for a group. Good spot for a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"maaaan don't know where else you could find authentic spicy hot pot. 

granted it's on the expensive side--maybe $40+ per person with drinks, it's worth checking out. the service is very good, they're always very attentive. 

if you are able to, avoid the peak times since it's possible to wait several hours =|"}
{"text":"While the selection of ingredients are aplenty - with many soup bases to choose from (cabbage as well as the green chilli are great)... it became very frustrating to ask for enough meat for 4 people at our table. 

Understandably, they are a business and lamb is arguably the highest cost item on the menu. But, it became a little ridiculous when we had to constantly ask the waitress repeatedly for one tray of lamb. 

Given the price (which is higher than most hot pot places in downtown), I would have expected better. 

We went on a Friday night, and the service was highly lacking. We didn't get our order of drinks for at least an hour, and when it came, it was the wrong order.

TIP: 

The restaurant has a nice ambiance and is conveniently located in Dundas. But would recommend making a reservation (only for 6+ people) and to go on a weekday when it is cheaper and less busy.

Also, the small split soup base at 5 dollars is a great option and provides variety!"}
{"text":"worst service ever. waitress doesn't accept new customers at all when they're busy even there's free table!! Only because they think they're too busy."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to hot pot which is one of my fave activities in the winter. Since this week the weather seemed to be more like fall, me and a friend decided to go for hotpot to warm up!  

I must say this is the first time I ever been to a \"Premium\" hot pot place! I don't understand why this place is 2 stars!?! It's decor, service and food was top notch to say the least! It's one of the best AYCE hotspot I've ever been to! Everything from the Angus marbled fatty beef to the lamb (surprisingly not too gamey) to the spicy Sichuan soup base was delicious! The meat was nicely marbled and thinly sliced so that it cooked in less than 5 seconds once it hit the boiling broth! 
I def recommend the watermelon juice and wintermelon juice to wash down the spiciness! Service was on par! Unlike some AYCE places who tries to ignore u, the staff there are nice and actually follows up with what hasn't arrived yet! Needless to say, I was stuffed to the max! The dinner ended with a choice of mango ice cream or slush! I had the slush which was a nice refreshing end to a very satisfying meal!
This is a must try for anyone who loves hotpot and wants real good food versus the subpar mediocre stuff! It's true what they say, u get what u pay for!"}
{"text":"Went to try out Moral's Chinatown location! It's on Dundas close walking distance to the Green P underground! This location unlike the uptown location is a little more understated, but still nicely furnished! Cool booth type sitting throughout! 
Unlike all those mediocre hot pot place, this place take ayce to a whole new level! Server comes in to toe your order with an iPad, and has pictures of the items to show u as reference!
Same as Richmond hill they also do fresh watermelon juice! 
Love the mix-urself sauce station! My fave was the homemade sesame sauce!
Lots of variety of soup base, here you can have your own private pot on side of the room on the other shared pots! If you like spicy this is the perfect hot pot place! Had the 10 year special spicy soup base split with the sweet tomato soup base! The numbing comes later after you have bit into a few of the peppercorn or the herbs in the spicy soup base! 
My personal fave were certified angus short rib slice! It was nicely marbled and thinly sliced! 
We also got the lamb slice, a variety of homemade meatballs! There was even one that was spicy! (For someone that loves ghost pepper and habernaro, it wasn't spicy at all)
Also ordered plenty of beef tongue! I love how it's already cooked and very thinly slice so all u need is a few seconds of swishing it in the boiling broth and it's done! The service here is impeccable as soon as I finished a plate someone's there to clear it out of the way without being asked! And when my drink was finished I was also checked upon to see if I wanted anything else? Rarely do Chinese places ever do that! This really struck out to me! They were attentive!
Unlike the Richmond hill location, the spring roll and deep fried buns with condensed milk are placed at the sauce station! So u just go up and help urself! The first bun I had was slightly cold but I saw them bring out a fresh bowl and I think I had half a dozen of them for dessert!
Speaking of dessert each person at the end of the meal gets a nice sweet ice cream soft serve! It's rich and creamy unlike any soft served I've had! 
Nice touch to finish off the hot and spicy hot pot with the cooling sensation and creaminess of the soft serve to cleanse my palette! Can't wait to try all the other soup base! Pork bone soup is definitely my next choice!"}
{"text":"Service good. People nice but busy. If you don't make reservation first, you may wait over an hour to be seated during weekend. For me, I just come here around 4 when they just open. =D"}
{"text":"This is the third time I dined here. It is even busy at 930PM. Compared to Little Sheep Mongolian Hotpot, Morals Village is about $32 before taxes per person and significantly more expensive. The condiment bar is plentiful and hotpot selection is large. The soups cost extra so I recommend getting a large pot to share. There are no reservations but there is an Ipad for you to sign in to get a call when your table is ready. Peak time waits can be 45 minutes to 1 hour and they even have a waiting room designated for waiting??!!! Maybe they should build more tables so they can seat the waiting people? It is convenient to go to Little Sheep Mongolian Hotpot if they are too busy. Go early! For two people with two fresh squeezed pear juice, one large pot (beef tomato soup and herbal) on a Sunday = $84.14. The Angus beef is worth it to try this hotpot place. You get a mini ice-cream cone at the end."}
{"text":"We came around 7pm Friday night and there was a line up. I guess its still winter in Canada and people want to have a meal to keep them warm on a cold Friday Night.

Seating: What I found interesting was how you get your table. You arrive at the front counter with a iPad. This is where you input your name, parties and your phone number. Once they have a free seat they will call you to let you know your table is ready. I find that more efficient than waiting near the main entrance as you can walk around the mall.

Price:  Bit on the higher sized consider its Unionville. Need to add extra money for the soup. almost $38-40 person 

Food: 
Beef very tender and fresh.
Lots of vegetables and fish ball to choose from 
Fried Bao were amazing. They come out crispy and hot. 

At the end of your meal you can choose which flavour of ice cream you want. Green tea or Vanilla. They limit one ice cream cone which is a bummer consider that it is an AYCE place."}
{"text":"Service was horrible the last time I went. The last two times I went, it was okay but last time was horrible. The food is okay, nothing really special! Price is average. Ordered a pitcher of watermelon juice that was supposed to be shared between 3-4 people......not sure how much 3-4 people would get as it was just a tall cup that they called a 'pitcher'. I would say it was for 2 people to share. Would probably go again a few months later."}
{"text":"This is really good!! I really love DeZhuang hotspot in China! The service e is good! I'm so sorry,so sorry! You have to take this place! This is the rule! ???????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"This is my second time back and I went with my boyfriend and my parents. We all agreed that the service was wonderful and the food was served quickly. We tried the pork bone, tomato, mushroom, and herbal soup bases. They were all quite flavorful but it does get diluted with the generic soup stock used as refill throughout your meal. They were very diligent in ensuring our soups never ran low and refilled it periodically. 

My parents were happy with the quality of the meats. They said it was above their expectations for ayce hot pot and the shrimp was very fresh! Only suggestion they had for improvement is maybe having more choices for meat and more cooked food variety. 

My boyfriend enjoyed the spring rolls in particular. He said it'd be better with more filing but he still ate like 6 lol. They only have spring rolls and deep fried bun for cooked foods and they're both great but we would like to see more options. Only complaint he had was that he wished they also had chicken. 

Personally, I have no complaints about the food and was happy that ice cream was not limited lol. Only problem we encountered was when we asked for Coke and without clarifying whether we wanted can, glass bottle, or fountain (included in the meal), we were given glass bottled Coke. Other than that, everyone was happy with their meal."}
{"text":"After all the hype and reading the great reviews... maybe i had my expectations set a tad bit too high as Allen and crew were lackluster at best.  So... where too start...
Service: these guys only go through the actions to barely get things to you.   From the ordering (need to be fluent in mandarin- as they don't truly understand what the English items are... cantonese is not accepted here on any levels)  The speed of service would be comparable to Canada Post.  You will receive it... MAYBE, when... don't push your luck here. They did give a nice service bonus, as you are cooking/ boiling your food, they top off the once boiling  pot with cold soup... WTF are they thinking?  Cold brew hot pot?

Food:  they have an extensive menu of items to choose from.   Be it soup base which the pork bone soup had no hint of pork taste or smell to it.  The meats, and other items are all frozen... mainly.  Fresh meat balls, dumplings.  Meats... all cryo-stasis to ensure freshness?  Only the vegi's were somewhat fresh. Their lamb was a tad above meh but their high grade AAA beef  was... once upon a time high grade beef that's been left too age past the best before date. The only somewhat acceptable item would be the fresh shrimp wah - yes wah... as is... WAH it's kinda salty but the best of the worst does not win any awards here. 

To pay, you need to go-to the counter to pay, NOT they bring the bill to you...  oh, cash and debit only.  No credit cards what so ever


For their price point, there are MANY better restaurants that offer a MUCH better dining experience on terms of food and price combined.  /end rant

I did not get any ice cream, that ALL other tables received.  Maybe that's why I'm such a grouch today..."}
{"text":"I've been here 2 times and both of the time had great experience. The staff are very attentive, friendly and especially the guy named Carson (is that his name?) who took our order - he is the best!"}
{"text":"The WORST hot pot, if not meal I have ever had. I will NEVER come back here. Zero star review. 

The food is poor quality and tasteless. They never come to clear the dirty plates so they just pile up all over the table. The service is horrendous. They forgot half of what we ordered and it was like pulling teeth trying to find a waiter to order more food (or to ask wtf happened to the stuff we ordered 45 minutes ago and never came). It takes AGES for anything to come out. We asked FOUR times for them to add more water to the soup that was now an inch of murky sludge in the pot before they came by with a jug. When you asked for something they would say uhhhh one sec and never come back. The initial utensils we got had dried food on them.... I can go on.....

RAGE. I feel robbed paying for this meal. For two of us the bill came to $70. On a weeknight! (The only extra we got was one Diet Coke - the best part of the meal). For this price or just a little more we could have gone to a good joint downtown for delicious food and amazing service. For this price we didn't even get mediocre food and service. What a joke. 

Do NOT go here. Stick to Hipot (which until now I thought was so-so but it's like Michelin star compared to this shizzzz) or Hopo or the world bowl hot pot place. Seriously. Don't eat here. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for the first time and enjoyed the selection of meats and veggies! Our pot wasn't heating correctly and the manager came over and fixed it right away. Our server, Carson, was very accommodating! Will definitely return~"}
{"text":"I think it's the best hot pot in this area. Love the hot soup base and lamb/ beef rolls here! Watermelon juice was yummy"}
{"text":"Morals Village is a hot pot restaurant chain with over 600 locations in China. They opened their first Canadian location in 2015, and has since grown at a relatively rapid pace. I have been to both downtown and Mississauga locations on several occasions, as it's one of my favourite spot for AYCE hot pot. With that being said, Morals Village prides themselves in providing top-notch quality and Szechuan cuisine influenced flavour with their hot pot offering.

Here, they provide a more upscale hot pot experience, and it does reflect in their pricing. Dinner is $25.99 on the weekday for adults, and +$2 for weekends. Price-wise, it is higher than other hot pot establishments, but the quality ingredients are definitely noticeable.

There is also a customization aspect to doing hot pot at Morals Village, as you are able to create your own sauce. A wide variety of sauces are available at the designated sauce station, and include options like chili oil, sesame oil garlic, satay, soy sauce, and more. You are more than welcome to mix and add different sauces to your liking.

I absolutely love the deep fried buns with condensed milk here (when they're freshly brought out). I wish that the servers would replenished them more often, as sometimes the buns are too cold. 

Personally, I have never had bad service at either Morals Village locations (referring to when I'm eating as a customer and not media-related). Plates are cleared, water is refilled and food do arrive quite quickly. 

Until August 31st, 2017, they have an ongoing promo for 30% off to celebrate their 4th anniversary at all locations (except Ottawa)."}
{"text":"I called to ask whether I could make reservation, and gave them an estimate arrival time, which I was told that I can walk in to eat without waiting in line. I drove 45 minutes, and was told the last call was passed, so they cannot seat me. They time I arrived the restaurant was 1.5 hour before they closed. Worst in the worst service I have ever experienced!!! Don't even try wasting your time!"}
{"text":"By far my favourite hotpot in the city - and I've been to almost all of them. For me, everything was a win. The broths were fantastic -  I had the sweet corn and the spicy and they were delicious. My friends tomato and green peppercorn broths were also winners for me, and next time I am going to do a sweet corn/green peppercorn split. The ingredients provided were super fresh, much nicer than the ones I've seen at other spots in the city. They also arrived very quickly from when we ordered. Service was really great - friendly and prompt. I never felt like we were waiting too long for anything, and when we needed something, James was there. The sauce station was missing peanut sauce to add to my mix, but the stack of fresh fried buns and condensed milk at the end of the station made up for any wrong doings. 

Finally, the decor was so lovely, they have a great waiting area (it gets busy) and I loved all the little touches, from the layout to the individual controls for each of our hotplates. I sincerely hope this restaurant maintains its higher standards because this is my new go-to for hotpot in all of Toronto."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We were told we will have to wait 10 mins and turned into 30 and when we finally getting seated we are positioned into a 2 seater of a 8 people table with another bigger group that we didn't know of. With how awkward that was and the witness being very rude about the situation, the 1 star is given. No food was in reviewed."}
{"text":"I will never come back to this place.  First off the service was horrible.  We had to ask for our order three times before our order actually came out.  Then our server complained their tip wasn't enough even though he didn't really serve us. 

This place definitely has no morals in my opinion."}
{"text":"What to try:

Of course hot pot!!! They are AYCE so go crazy and order everything you fancy on the menu. I personally like the pork bone soup, one for their price (it's one of the cheaper soupbases) and it's not overpowering in comparison to the other ones. How it works? You have to order a soup base before you can select the food items and you can have as many food items as you want. The food items I would usually recommend is the fresh cuttlefish and shrimp paste. It's fishballs but it's made fresh daily. And we all love fresh food preparations right? I also recommend corn and spicy fish . Corn really tastes great in hot pot! 

Last tips:

Come prepared with cash or a debit card! They don't take credit!! :( Don't forget to make your sauce at the front of the restaurant. You can mix and match different sauces and garnish it with parsley and green onion that you can compliment with your meal. There is also spring roll and fried Chinese bun! Spring roll can be eaten like an appetizer at the beginning and please don't forget to try the Chinese fried buns!! Dipped in sweet milk, it definitely is worth a try...especially when it's freshly out of the fryer!! Usually as a dessert. There is also soft serve green tea or vanilla ice cream that is complimentary at the end of your meal. So don't leave before you grab that last cone!!!"}
{"text":"Nice environment, but bad service. A group of 9 of us came in hoping for a great hotpot experience as we were all starving. Waited around 50 mins to be seated, as expected as we came in at 7:30pm on a Saturday night. Service was incredibly slow right from the start, took awhile to get our soup bases and pots ready. Most of us eat a lot of beef and lamb, but it took forever for them to bring the portions that we asked for. They only brought one or two plates of meat every 20 mins for our big group when we asked for 4-5 servings at once as we have 5 big guys who eat a lot of meat.. We were paying for \"all we can eat\" weren't we? They never brought us more meat as we requested; we had to tell them many many times and we ended up giving up and filled ourselves with udon instead. they always forgot our simple additional orders like a can of pop as well. Our waitress wasn't in the best mood either, gave us attitude and looked at us like we were crazy when we asked for refills for our 9 glasses of water and when we all wanted ice cream, she stated we are only allowed to have one scoop of ice cream as the dessert per person (not reasonable for the price we have to pay in my opinion). With a drink, this dinner costed around $45 per person including tip, a high price to pay for regular hotpot with very poor service. Most of our group were disappointed. Quality of food was slightly above average, but quality of service was horrible... I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Pissed.... Waited for 1.5 hours and Server didn't arrange seats for us. We have 5 ppl. She split the big table to serve 2 small group instead. The server name Silver has very bad attitude and has no manner. Will never go if she is working there.  Server rating 0/5......"}
{"text":"if you want to try the hot pot in Toronto, this is the place you should come. The location is in Chinatown and may 15 mints bus took to the lake. Just a small tip, the spicy soup in the mix pot is hotter then you think, if you not good at it please choice the lighter one."}
{"text":"Hotpot on a summer evening.... why not.  The room temperature was set up nice and cool for what would otherwise be a great wintry dinner.  I liked how there were many options of soup base to select from, ranging from French inspired soupbase to somthing as simple as chicken soupbase at $3.  There is a menu of food to select from and i must say i was impressed with the expansive choices.  That said,  some of the items were still frozen when they came to our table.  It's a good thing that it's hotpot and we could just dump the frozen food into the boiling soup.
Unfortunately for this restaurant, the service was atrocious.  The staff did not check in with us to make sure we were ok.  I had to leave our VIP room in search of water. And then soupbase refill.  And then our dessert as well.  We waited for over 30 minutes before we got our ice cream in cones.  Truth be said,  i was disappointed that there was only vanilla flavor  available.  Ironically the ice cream didn't taste like vanilla, and it was grainy.  
The dinner was a promotional deal with 30% off.  I ended paying $28.  Service charge was automatically added to our bill because we were a party of 8.  If given the choice, i would not have been generous with my tip.  At all."}
{"text":"good quality ingredients, horrible wait time.

oh and seats are still the wrong fucking height."}
{"text":"High quality soup base ($13 for large super spicy base) and ingredients
Decent selection of dips/garnishes
Decent service
Nice tables/seating

-1 =
-deep fried items beside dips were nasty and stale sitting there, make these made-to-order
-missed plenty of items ordered such as seafood and meat.  however saw a table nearby waste plenty of meat...charge them for waste aggressively @management."}
{"text":"OK food but very bad services. Their staff were not helpful and kept messed up with orders. Also, they will automatically add tips to your bill, so make sure you don't tip twice."}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Unlike the other reviewers who had to wait, we had reservations and were sat right away. 

Its a hot pot place so you pick a broth, dipping sauce then all the food you could possibly eat!!  

I was wavering between 3or 4 stars. I'm going to say 3.5.  They nickel and dime you on the cost of broth and sauces. A few items we wanted were not available . of course they were ones that were a bit pricey.  Spam and ramen were a plenty!   Service was okay. We had things refilled often. No complaints (we didn't have solver though ;) )"}
{"text":"I was kind of skeptical at first due to the rating on yelp but decided to try anyways.  I was quite surprised,  the food quality was pretty fresh,  service was not bad,  however some of the servers don't understand English that well but we were able to get a hold off a couple that did understand, and they are very kind and provided great service to us. 

One item I don't usually see at hotpot is the cheese beef ball,  it tastes as good as it sounds,  definitely get an order if you go, you won't regret it.  Asides from that,  everything is your standard hotpot items from your typical all you can eat hotpot.   Everyone gets their own pot,  and there are no free standard soup bases,  so expect to spend about $37 after tax and tip without drinks."}
