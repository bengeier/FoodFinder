{"text":"We are still in search of a good Mexican restaurant.  We went today and I had taquitos. They were nothing special, actually over-cooked.   Where are the good Mexican restaurants in this town?"}
{"text":"My wife wanted to try this place.  I am so glad she did.  The food was absolutely fantastic!  The salsa is homemade and delicious.  I had a carnitas enchilada and a carne asada taco.  Both were excellent.  My wife's green chili pork enchilada and chicken enchilada were just as good.  

The service was great as well.

This semi-hidden family owned \"hole in the wall\"
is worth the trip up Boulder Highway.   If you want an excellent family owned Mexican food experience, this is the place to come."}
{"text":"Here I finally am, writing my first Yelp review, and why not have my first review be about a place that I have been eating at since I was a very young kid, one that I have been to nearly 50 times.

El Torito has always been a simple, inexpensive alternative to your typical Mexican restaurant in the area, it definitely caters toward the local inhabitants of Henderson, it offers the traditional items that you would expect from a Mexican eatery, but provides it in a different way, with the menu varying beyond just Mexican food, things like 'chicken tenders' and even 'BLT sandwiches' are featured on the menu. El Torito doesn't advertise itself as an elegant eatery, and its obvious that they have no interest in creating a special atmosphere. Both the interior and exterior are very plain, with little identity created, you can tell that the mindset of design stayed within your typical Henderson boundary, but, El Torito can pull this off simply do to the local crowd swarming in on a nightly basis, the regular customer base expects little beyond the food, so placing the burden of 'interior design' on El Torito is inquisitional, just dont expect anything fancy or mind-blowing before you arrive. 

Once you receive your menus, you will then be given a small tray of chips and salsa, as per usual at a Mexican eatery, the chips aren't special, and in all my experiences they have never actually been heated, its as if the chips are taking directly out of the bag, but, the Salsa has a unique flavor that is indeed good, this will be your first run in with the food. The Mexican portion of the menu doesn't feature anything substantially special that you cant find at other restaurants, but, El Torito does include an American-Mexican style of food. It offers ground beef with a majority of its items, which is always a good alternative when you get sick of the standard shredded beef that you encounter at most Mexican Restaurants. The enchiladas are the highlight of the menu, the sauce is simply brilliant, and you will either love, or dislike the sauce as it has a very rich flavor, you also have the option of ordering hot enchilada sauce which adds a nice kick and isn't overwhelming at all. Beyond the enchiladas, a majority of the items on the menu are mediocre, they have decent flavor and good portion size for what you pay for, but wont necessarily blow your mind.

Lastly, the service varies, on some occasions, you can get absolutely terrible service, while on other days, you can get great service. El Torito tends to be busy, especially on weekend nights, so expect a large amount of people eating and perhaps a short waiting time. Gia seems to be the best server, she is always nice and quick with delivering your order. The service itself is pretty much what you would expect from a local restaurant. 

In the end, El Torito is a inexpensive restaurant that is an easy destination if you are looking to savor a quick bite, I would recommend this restaurant to casual eaters, but I would personally avoid this restaurant as a date spot or romantic destination."}
{"text":"The green chile pork is fantastic. The venue is authentic, and the servers were very nice."}
{"text":"The ONLY place you should order mexican food from!! An amazing company ran by and amazing family! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING FOOD"}
{"text":"Nothing super fancy, but good food. In this part of Henderson, non-fast food options are scarce. The place looks super sketchy from the outside, but it's  cozy and friendly inside. Staff was friendly and helpful, food was great, and speed of service was perfect.
We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Where do I start...I was introduced to this place by my girlfriend upon my arrival in to LV in 2009.  The food is always hot and consistent.  It's a family owned restaurant with a small town feel.  This is by far our favorite Mexican restaurant in the area.  My favorite dish: Carnitas!!!"}
{"text":"Great food except for the chips.  Kind of disappointed as that is one of those cravings you want satisfied when you eat Mexican.  Service ok, not great."}
{"text":"I read all the great reviews and decided to give it a try. I'm scratching my head at how people think the chips and salsa were amazing..Tasted like they opened it from a store bought bag. Now that I think of it, all of the food tasted like they pulled it out of the freezer. Could've gone to trader joes & bought some microwave mexican food that was just as good and saved $$"}
{"text":"Good breakfast burrito!! Place is so close to my house. Very good authentic mexican. 
I will frequent this place again!! muy bueno"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant.  The salsa keeps me coming back. My favorites are the chili relleno, chimichanga with carnitas and the green sauce, and their breakfast with chorizo is amazing! Luckily we live close by."}
{"text":"I live within a few miles of this place and have pretty much ignored it. This morning my place was too busy and I have to go out of town today. 
Chips and salsa were nothing to write about, I like good spicy salsa and this was nothing close to hot or spicy. Surprised me with all the staff and authenticity when you walk in. Code for hole in the wall. 
I ordered the #13, chile verde with eggs and hash browns. Wow, very tasty green chile, eggs and hash browns were great too. I got there at a good time because it got busy. You can tell they get a lot of regulars, and for good reason. Breakfast was filling and very good. I would come back here, yes that's if my other spot is too busy."}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant twice since moving to Henderson and this last time it took an hour and a half to get our meal. I will probably not going back."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful hole-in-the-wall Mexican Restaurant! The food and service was fantastic! The Owner's daughter waited on me and she was very attentive. The entire staff was fantastic! And the food was really good. I found this place a few years ago while on a business trip and I always wanted to go back. I live in Las Vegas now and was in the area so I drove around searching for the restaurant - got lost - and found it again! I will definitely be back! This is a locals restaurant and I can hardly wait to go back next time I am in the area!"}
{"text":"If i could give zero stars I would. I was beyond disappointed. I was excited because how close it is to our home and all of the great reviews on here about how authentic, fresh, and delicious the food is. And it awful. Hubby got carnitas tacos, I got chicken fajitas,our son got chicken fingers and grandma got the carnitas platter. First the salsa and chips they serve you as you wait.. The salsa had very little flavor. The chicken on my fajitas was overcooked, dry, unseasoned and just awful.. The Spanish rice was bland probably just bouillon cube boiled in the rice. The guac wasn't anything special but it might've been the best thjng there along with the chicken fingers. The carnitas was DRY!! Unfortunately will not be going back"}
{"text":"I've loved this restaurant since moving here in 1992. The albondigas soup is the BEST!!  I don't come to this side of the valley often, but when I do a stop at El Torito !!"}
{"text":"So we went here for dinner . Not impressed with the service- drink order was wrong- margarita on the rocks was watered down and no lime . Maybe they were having an off night - but chips were cold and stale- chili relano was barely edible.  Salad was not brought  food was not cooked properly. No one checked on us- we ran out of beverage- check was plopped down - no dessert was offered.  For a $30 meal - was not impressed . Again - maybe it was an off night but will not come back ."}
{"text":"I love this place. Grew up going here. Read some of the reviews that people leave. I will always go back and enjoy my meals here. People seem to have a bad day so they leave nasty comments. Get a life. Still better than cooking for yourself."}
{"text":"I love El Torito!  It is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Henderson and go here a few times per month.  They are family owned, have friendly staff and the food is really, really good (especially the green chile pork)."}
{"text":"This place looks a little shabby but don't be fooled they have good food and it's nice and clean. This place has the best salsa-I normally don't enjoy the salsa some places bring out but El Torito is the one place I'll actually eat it. For lunch had the #10 Chimichanga with shredded beef and it was really good. My friend introduced me to this place and I'm glad she did-will be back again!"}
{"text":"The servers are very sweet but the food is not great and certainly not worth the price. My man and I have tried this place several times (not many food options in this area) and the food never lives up to what people have said about this place. The chips always taste burnt/stale which leads me to think that the oil is old. The burritos are big but the meat or beans inside have little flavor- again tasting like the food is old. I have never dined in but the decor looks old, tired, cheap and neglected. For 4 dinner entrees and chips, the takeout bill came to $60. I'm gonna need better quality for that high price."}
{"text":"Food is same quality as any other greasy Mexican joint... but you get to sit down for the whole sad, upsetting experience.  Slow service.... way too long wait times for simple 'house specialties'... don't get me started on the wait for the food. Last time I went I literally walked out after 45 minutes, no food, not wanting more than 1 drink.... not trying to fill up on endless chips. Lastly, English is good to know when communicating with patrons, hard to understand when they refuse to assimilate and speak like 2 year olds. Fail across the board"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars for nostalgic reasons only as I used to come here in high school (90s) and remember it being awesome... but if I had not come here in my youth I'd probably only give it 1 star.  I took my family here recently. Service was great and fast, but the food was just ok for being so pricey. I will not go back again :P"}
{"text":"Decided to try El Torito Cafe for the first time tonight because of the reviews. Here we go:
Margaritas are strong. Albondigas soup was great. The Chips are broken up store bought Tostada Shells and the House Salsa was kinda bland in flavor with a little spice. I had the Carnitas Plate which was extremely dry but tasty. My wife had (1) Soft Carnitas Taco (which was also dry) and (1) Hard Shell Carne Taco which she said was just OK. My Daughter had the A La Carte Taquitos which she thought were delicious.  If you do end up here, ask for the \"other\" Salsa, much better than the regular one. BTW, the Address is 2126 S Boulder Hwy, Henderson, NV 89002."}
{"text":"You can not judge a book by it's cover- Nor can you judge a restaurant by it's unassuming appearance....
Because this place has Great food EVERYTIME! 
Yesterday, I picked up my friend Lisa and we decided to do some old school Henderson Eating!
El Torito has been in Henderson for as long as I can remember- It has gone from a one room eatery to a nice size cafe. 
I am not crazy about their nachos or fajitas ... but what is good- is their traditional style mexican food. 
Cheese enchiladas.. YUM
Green chili pork enchiladas double YUM
Their tacos with homemade shells are delicious too. They have so many good items that it is hard to put them all right here.
Yesterday I had a green chili pork enchilada AND a ground beef taco. 
DIVINE! Also sampled some chips with their unique and totally scrumptious salsa. 
Their rice is not like most rice at a mexican food eatery. It is their own recipe and it is not tomato based... hands down the best mexican rice ever. 
They also make albondigas soup , which is a treat you simply can not miss out on.
I love that this restaurant is family owned and passed down generation to generation. 
Unbelievably good..."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mexican restaurant I've gone to. It's a hole in the wall place with home made food. The building is more mature and if the food wasn't so good, I wouldn't even go inside . But I promise you , once you've tried the food, this is the only place you will go to. Closed on Mondays which is a down fall, but we all need a day off right !?"}
{"text":"Stopped there for breakfast, it was the worse ever. Scrambled eggs over cooked, coffee was cold. The breakfast burrito was nuked and too hot to eat. 
The waitress aka cashier didn't have change in the til and didn't even acknowledge us as we left."}
{"text":"Best enchiladas around!  Always consistent , good food and service have been going here for years.love the salsa."}
{"text":"This place is horrible....everything from the decor to the service. I've been twice, both in 2011. I can't remember what I had the first time (that says a lot in its self). The second time, I had a chicken enchilada & beef taco combo. The food is so bland it's ridiculous, otherwise it tastes like dog food. This place is hideous...the funny thing is both times I went with my friend & his family and they love it. I can only guess the family has no taste buds or has NEVER had Mexican food before."}
{"text":"Omg.  I think you need to know the fellow diners in order to have a good experience.  They paid too much attention to us when we were there for dinner.  We felt like we were the new kids on the block.  Oh, the waitresses were talking about their latest relationship status.  So loud that by the end of the night, I knew which of the girls liked another girl.  Haha.  Crazy."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican food restaurant, it is a drive away from us but well worth it.

I usually order the carnitas but I have z new favorite which is the Chile relleno the red sauce is out of this world. 

We were told this has been the same owners for 4 decades. 

This is s must try yelp family. Trust me you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"I don't get why this place has the ratings it does. The guacamole is a joke. Service isn't great. But the main problem is the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Here's the situation with El Torito,

I've heard AMAZING things about this place. And I mean amazing! My personal experience summarized into 4 parts is this:

*Staff- very nice and friendly.

*Location- unique building with a super pretty view of the mountains, with windows to admire the dessert nature. The inside is also neat because it has some cool wall art and little fun details

* Pricing- not super affordable, but not incredibly expensive. Somewhere in the middle.

*Food- and lastly...food. Their food was honestly a disappointment. I'm not sure if it was my personal preference, but Mexican food is my favorite, and nothing about to food satisfied me. The salsa was not my favorite at all (which btw chips and salsa is the best part of going to Mexican restaurants!!) I ordered the chicken enchiladas and for some reason they just weren't that special. I'm so sad about this, but I need to be honest, the food IMO isn't anything to write home about. 
*And for that reason alone, I probably won't be coming back, unless a friend wants to go there.  I just wouldn't go out of my way to spend money on what I think is mediocre food"}
{"text":"My husband grew up eating at El Torito and while I was at first dismayed by the appearance, it has won me over! The salsa is amazing- we will buy it to take home- and we love the wet burrito, green pork burrito and the cheese enchiladas. A great family run restaurant with lots of history with the locals."}
{"text":"Never again! Service is a joke and it's way overpriced for the portions. Mexican food should be clean and it's very cost effective to make, for the shitty environment its by far not close to worth it."}
{"text":"Never again! Paid way to much for 6 people. Over 100 dollars. 
First off, I've been here before this time and it was alright. The rice is gross. 
BUT decided to try it again because I like the albondigas. 
Secondly, we sit down and within TEN MINUTES my son has a HUGE black bug on his shoulder. We start freaking out and the waitress comes over and kills it and says oh it's just a light bug, we look up at the light and YUP there's a few bugs in there. Anyway we order because we already have all the kids settled and ready to eat. We get the food (not that great) eat and are ready for our receipts. Since we paid two ways, I was shocked to find out that for three people on one receipts was 53 dollars. No beers nothing, just food and soda. On the other receipts it was 54 dollars for three people. Crazy if you ask me. I'm so annoyed with this place after having a bug on my child I am shocked they wouldn't discount anything. THEN as we are leaving I ask the waitress for a refill on the 3 dollar small child sized apple juice and she said no, they don't refill juice. REALLY?!?!?! I'm never coming here EVER again, and refuse to let this go. Reported this to the health inspectors. YUCK!"}
{"text":"Was Good- Horrible Now. What a shame it's gone down hill to the extent we will never go back. Entrees and tacos were never good, but we liked the burritos and enchiladas. Went there a couple of times a month until the food and service got so bad. The owner clearly doesn't care anymore, the food was inconsistent and service slow at best. Really a shame the grand daughter let her mother and grandmother down."}
{"text":"The first few times i have dined here I really loved it. I no longer feel the same way! Tell me why EVERY TIME they forget my boyfriends soup. We have to remind them and by the time it comes hes half way done with his meal. This has even happened when we ordered take out. We get home and what do you know, they forgot the soup! This place could use a good cleaning/make over head to toe. 

HOWEVER their enchiladas are probably the best around town.

I just wish they would get  back on the ball"}
{"text":"A well priced mom and pop Mexican restaurant.  The food for me was similar to other restaurants like it, but the sauces for the wet burrito and chile ranchero were good and authentic with the right amount of kick.  It looked like just the owner serving the whole place with a good amount of people in there, so I wouldn't expect super fast service, but for some solid Mexican food at a decent price, this is a good stop.  From what I saw, this place is a 3-4, but the authenticity and the hometown feel pushes out over."}
{"text":"Food not that good. Comes from a can, I had a Groupon that is why I checked this place out and needles to say I would not have paid full price for the food. Place is old inside so I though the food would be more authentic but was surprised. The prices are ok $9-18 plate so it is reasonable."}
{"text":"From what I'm told this is the oldest restuarunt in Henderson and let me tell you what it looks like it , but the food was pretty good the Mexican meatball soup is a must. The meatball is full of flavor in a very tasty broth. Now I ordered the fajitas chicken and it tasted pretty good, I seen other peoples plates and they looked really good. When I'm back in Vegas I'll be back to El Torito to try some other things. This place is worth a chance for sure even though it looks like u might get robbed there."}
{"text":"One dark night, a few years back, my husband told me he was going to take me out for some incredible Mexican food. He drove me down Boulder Hwy to El Torito and I was scared. The parking lot leaves a lot to be desired and the restaurant has an old-town, vintage feel. BUT - once you walk in, it's crowded, friendly and casual! As soon as we ordered and I tasted the abondigas soup, I was sold!

Fast forward, years later, we have small kids now and our family adores this restaurant. The hostess/manager (cannot think of her name but she rocks!) remembers her customers, even after 1 visit. Our two VERY picky daughters love coming here. Our 7 year old craves their rice and my 4 year old loves the bean and cheese burrito as well as the chips and salsa.

The staff is always accommodating and friendly. I'm fairly certain that my kids have spilled drinks at least once per visit and they handle it like nothing happened.

Their chicken is fresh and seasoned well. My husband always orders the fajitas and he loves them!

On our last visit I decided to be very bad and order a chicken chimichanga covered in sauce. I'd been craving one so I gave in. I haven't stopped craving another one since that visit but I usually stick to healthier fare like fajitas. 

The enchiladas rock, the salsa isn't very spicy but the flavor is so good! Their fresh chips are a family fave!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 17 years and still enjoying it.  I really get anything new I stick with the soup and cheese enchilada.  My wife goes from breakfast to the hamburger.  We will often bring our family here and as with the restaurants founders we have started a tradition, Our kids are now bringing people here."}
{"text":"this is the best Mexican food in the valley. from the outside it looks like a dive, but it should be on diners, drive inns, and dives because the food is that good. i have been eating here for over 10 years and have never had a bad meal. make sure you get the soup, it is awesome!! if you have not been you are missing out!"}
{"text":"The food is great but very pricey and every time they get super busy the service is affected in a negative way."}
{"text":"I like the a la cart shredded beef chimichanga here.
They give you a small salad with it, sour cream
and guacamole, plenty of chips and salsa...
all for $8.50 (+tax).  
The service is always friendly and its nice to come
to an older establishment that has been in business
since 1975.  OMG...I was 25 back then!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been going here scince i was born literally! The chips and salsa are amazing! My favorite is the green chilli enchillada. DELISH!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Showed up with a very large group and they did a great Jo accommodating us. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much, but good food! Enchilada's Ranchero's were really good. My Son had green chili with pork enchiladas and they were very good."}
{"text":"I've given this place two chances. I will not be back! The services is terrible! Walked in they cleaned a both for us and sat us right away but took 10 minutes or so for the hostess to finally offer us drinks. She keeping looking around to see where the waitress was that was actually supposed to service us. Finally got our drinks but took another 10 minutes for the hostess again to get us our menus. We finally order and they bring me the soup with a black hair (definitely not my hair color) on the soup bowl. Ordered the bean and cheese burrito and ground beef taco. Both just ok. Over all the restaurant seems dirty and disorganized."}
{"text":"Love this place. Excellent food and margaritas. It is a storefront, family business, so maybe not for everyone."}
{"text":"I give this place a 5 star, we recently moved to the area to our new home, and being from Chicago where you can get the Worlds best food, I put this place on the Map. The Pork Green Hatch Chili is freakin amazing. Great taste great flavor savor savor... Walked in and just love the authentic traditional Mexican restaurant feel. My wife being from New Mexico and finding out the Owners originally where from Mexico then migrated to New Mexico and Then Henderson Nevada is amazing. My wife was so happy, she said \"finally food from home\" the great southwest. I got her the Pork green chili Al la carte platter and she just went to town on the food.


So glad to find this family ran traditional food for her and my Mexican food loving self. Lmao Being Puerto Rican sometimes it's hard to except food as good as Puerto Rican food. But this place is well worth the stop, whether your new to Vegas driving thru from the Az or heading out with the family. A great place to stop for Lunch or dinner. Pricing was very cheap for the greatness of quality of food you get. I pretty much got. Little bit of everything on the menu lol. This place is fire"}
{"text":"Had high hopes... disapponted. After a long wait for our food, the chicken fajitas were meager, and not the typical fajitas.  It was shredded chicken served over mostly raw vegetables on a iron platter.  Way too salty, not much other flavor.   A la carte for $12.00 not good.   Pretty dry and boring.  Chips and salsa was good tho.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"horrible place just discusting i went there on 01/30/16 which was a saturday i live 40 mintues away from this place and i been here before like twice with my coworkers so i decided to come to this place with my bf  becuase it was my bf b-day so we got there and we got served and everything i ordered a burrito of carne asada/carnitas and it came with beans and rice the rice looked like they heated up from the day before and there was only carnitas no carne asada at all when i told them i wanted carne asada / carnitas  burrito then my bf ordered a hamburger steak and apperantly to them a hamburger steak is just a piece of meat on a plate with french fries and on top of that i told the lady that my bf had ordered a hamburger steak and they said that that was a hamburger steak and i ask the lady where is the buns? and lettce, tomatos onions and she said oh its a dollar extra for buns and the meat tasted  like shit .it had no flavor   and my bf almost threw up it was just horrible and shitty customer service and there is a tall mexican guy that works there and he always has attended us really good and always asking if we need anything else when i came here with my coworkers but he wasnt there. and we got there at 8:40 p.m. and they close at 9:30 so the lady locked the door by the time we were finished and when we were gonna leave out she didnt even unlock the door for us she told us to unlock it with the keyes on there like that was her job to unlock the door for us  but wont have to waist gas anymore lol i wrote a review on google to on the same day we came here never again will i go there wate of gas time and money becuase there expensive"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican food, what more do you need to know. Been here a few times and will keep coming back to this family owned, local restaurant."}
{"text":"Some super good authentic homemade Mexican food in Henderson, NV of all places!  This is no way related to the lousy restaurant chain, this places if family owned and operated.   Great sauces and salsas.  Excellent chile relleno and enchiladas.  Home-cooked style beans and rice.  Our service was great and my Dos Equis was cold.  My parents live near this place and frequent the place all the time.  Definitey a place I want to go each time I visit them...and it helps that its very close to their home.   Nothing fancy about the place inside or out, but ample seating and good prices go with the excellent food!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now because it's very convenient to our house. I've tried both breakfast and lunch and really wasn't impressed at all with any of it.  The place is always packed for lunch and dinner, but I'm not really sure what the fuss is all about.

The chips and salsa are just ok. Not very fresh tasting.  The sauces on the burritos and enchiladas taste like it's canned (or just old).  I've had much better for a lot less money.  The dishes are spendy and the portion sizes are small.

On the good side, the service each time was great!"}
{"text":"We were there for an hour before we got our food and when we did it came out burnt.   Food is way over priced and service is horrible!"}
{"text":"My friend and I dined at El Torito Cafe last night. We arrived at about 6:15pm. The place was very busy. There seemed to be a very large party celebrating something. We were seated in booth number 3. It was the most disgustingly dirty booth I have ever seen. I was afraid to lean back for fear of soiling my white T-shirt. The seat was falling apart and had multiple applications of duct tape. Our server never did get over to take out order so we flagged down the man who was pouring water. He brought our water and chips & salsa. The salsa tasted home made but the chips tasted store bought. We did not wait long for our food. I had the 2 item combo of chili relleno and a shredded beef enchilada which comes with beans & rice. The relleno was very watery but the enchilada was tastey. The man who brought our food from the kitchen was charming but not charming enough to make me go back. If the booths are so disgusting the kitchen can't be that clean. I don't know why we stayed."}
{"text":"Open for 30 years must be doing something right.... food is above fast food but by far not the best I have had. The soup is killer but any kind of salad you order- well might as well open a bag from the store... not an item to go out of the way for. Free chips and salsa. The best thing I have had so far is on the appetizer menu it's steak w chese on flour tortillas and it's great!!"}
{"text":"Me and my family have been coming to this place since I was a little boy.  Now 30+ years later, I am still going 3-4 times a month and taking my wife and child.  This is a family owned business.  The salsa is the best I have ever had hands down.  You can buy the salsa by the gallon which we do on occasion and it doesn't last a week in my house.  I haven't tried too many items on the menu because I love the few items I have tried too much to try anything else.  I love the cheese enchiladas (hot).  The soup is absolutely delicious as well.  I also recomend the green chili burro (wet).  I will never stop going to this place.  It's the best hidden gem in henderson.  By far my favorite place to eat because the food is great, and because it's a long tradition in my family to go here.  Prices are fair also, although they have gone up a bit recently, but still well worth it for me."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I was a little girl. Love the salsa and enchilada sauce. I actually go and buy the sauce from them when I'm making my own enchiladas. Great service too."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a place to eat near by and at first we're hesitant to try this restaurant since it's our first to try it. To our surprise when we went inside there's a lot of people and seeing all the food coming out from the kitchen looks really amazing. As we were seated they gave us appetizer and thumbs up for that salsa it's so good we have to ask for another round. Once our food came out we were really satisfied it's really good and can't stop eating. The staff were friendly and they check on you once in awhile if you're doing good or if you need anything. we've been eating here since."}
{"text":"Heard mixed reviews, and they were on groupon so thought I would try it. Beans were cooked to the plate, rice was undercooked, and beef in the burrito tasted like rubber- way overcooked with no seasoning! The only reason why I am rating 3 stars is for the excellent customer service! They were on top of things, smiles and all!"}
{"text":"After a few years of living in Henderson we decided to try this place after we did we regretted it; Place was dirty, plates looked filthy, food tasted like reheated leftovers, rice tasted like chicken rice a roni, chips were cold and stale and we didn't get our complete order. Prices were way high for the quality of food. We were greeted when we came in and drinks came fast other than that this place is lackluster. My opinion, skip this place and go anyplace else."}
{"text":"Recomended from various people my family & I decided to go visit this restaurant for the first time. The chips & salsa were great as well as the albondiga soup. I tried the enchildas & even thou I'm more of a green sauce person their red sauce worked just fine. I'd say our overall experience was very plesant & the staff was too. We sure plan on visiting soon to have their delicious sopapilla dessert!"}
{"text":"This is a small family restaurant that has been in Henderson for years. They have great salsa that I purchase to take home and their food is great! Please keep in mind that this is not the best location and the furniture is worn, however the establishment is clean and friendly."}
{"text":"great for grubby mex food. No frills here tho.."}
{"text":"I come to Henderson about once a year if not more to visit my mom, but  because eating mom's cooking is one of the highlights of coming to visiting, the need to go out and eat was limited and since those I visited with are wimps when it comes to spicy, my places of choice were not as often as I would wish. 

However, my mom went into assisted living recently with great sadness her days of cooking are no more, but God provides good food nonetheless and He does so with El Torito Cafe. 

I've only eaten here probably only three time total prior to today but each time I do, I wish El Torito was in DeKalb. Today was no exception as I had the burrito w/chicken and I think it's described as smothered and hot, meaning it is covered in some hot sauce. 

As you know if you've read my other reviews I like hot and spicy and El Torito delivers the \"Spice is Nice\"

I've had enchiladas and tacos in the past was satisfied. I'm looking to make one more visit before I go home to try a chimichanga and with mom no longer cooking and El Torito being a reasonable drive from my mom's new home El Torito will become one of my must visits when visiting mom"}
{"text":"Love this classic Mexican joint!! Family owned & operate since FOREVER!!Original family recipes made fresh day in and day out. Salsa..& guac...fresh daily!! Best rice ever..chicken & spices! Enchilada sauce like no other....oh & the albondigas...watch out...you have never tasted a meatball soup like it!! Has been a favorite of mine since I was a teenager!! Special shout out to the hostess with the mostess...GIA!!"}
{"text":"I'm hemmed and hawed about giving a 3 or 4 star. I'd probably do a 3.5 if I could but I thought they were at least good enough to round up and not down. 

I've been going to this place for many years. This is my family's favorite mexican restaurant in the area and they've been here for 20 years so when visiting we would wind up here at some point. I've been several times since I've moved back.

This place probably is some of the better mexican that I've had in this city, which I find odd that there doesn't seem to be as many local mexican restaurants as one would think. I can attest to the great service every time I've been here. It seems like the same girl is always working and she is super friendly and everything comes out quickly. 

I always get a margherita when I go and I honestly think they have one of the best around. So many times it seems like they are all mix but here they give a heavy handed pour, which always makes me smile. They are huge, as well as, tasty. Heck, just writing this makes me want to go there after I go to the gym tonight.

I've eaten several things here and always enjoyed the food. I wouldn't say that it was so great that I just crave it, but then again, I keep going back so it is pretty good. I've never had an overly greasy meal and get the impression that the place is fairly clean. The location is kinda remote, but at least there is plenty of parking and if all else fails you can go to the gun shop next door before or after.

I love that this place is locally owned and operated! It's good to know that my meals have a more direct impact on the local economy. My final vote is go. If you want good food, friendly service, and tasty margheritas then El Torito Cafe is the place for you."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant when we're in the mood for good Mexican food and great attentive service. We've been coming to El Torito for over 20 years. In MY book, they have the BEST Chile Verde out there!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely open. Not only that they have great food. The carnitas are perfect, very lean. Ground beef tacos also great. Carne azada tacos were not as good, a little chewy. Not much from the outside but clean on the inside and the food kept me coming back three times in one week.
I checked some of the bad reviews. Some mentioned the salad was not that good. I don't know about you but I don't go to a Mexican restaurant because of the salad. So based on the main dishes I've had and the great salsa and thin chips I gave them 5 stars and continue to frequent El Torito Cafe."}
{"text":"I found the staff really friendly, and the clientele too! It's a pretty long menu with reasonable prices. Great salsa; can't tell if they make their own chips though.. back in Queens you could tell by how greasy the chips where.

The decor is just this side of Salvation Army, which just adds to the charm for me. St. Patrick's Day was coming up and they had green decorations hanging from the ceiling, which was also amusing given the sombreros on the walls and the overall redness of the furnishings.

Try the albondingas soup. It's a spicy beef broth with two meatballs."}
{"text":"I like El Torito! I feel like I have to make a good menu selection but I enjoyed the tamale in red sauce today! I love their red sauce!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Have been going here for years and the food is just as good as it was day one. Although I wish the portions were a little bigger and they were open later. Other than that they seriously have the best Mexican food in Henderson."}
{"text":"El Torito is a staple restaurant located in \"Old\" Henderson.  I remember my fiance, then boyfriend, and I would eat here back in High School, and we still try to make the long drive out every once in awhile to have some of the most authentic Mexican food available in this town.  In such a big city, places like this provide a small town feeling. 

My favorite item by far is the albondigas soup.  With a few crushed up tortilla chips, the soup is absolute perfection.  I am also a fan of their enchilladas (cheese, beef, chicken- any kind will do for me).  In addition, their horchata is great as well.  Not too sweet and not too watery!

As far as service goes, it is typically good.  Last time we went, it was a bit slow and we noticed other tables that ordered after us were being served before we were.  But, it was really not a deal breaker because we love the food so much!"}
{"text":"So many things that are wrong with this place; the staff are horribly incompetent, worst margarita I've ever had, just slushy water with possibly some left over tequila, the food was salty Taco Bell served on a blazing hot plate, even the water tasted bad!! Save yourself the atrocious memory you evidently will have by coming here."}
{"text":"First time going and will not go back. I was curious to try as it is by my house and always packed. As soon as I walked in I knew it was not authentic Mexican food, the decor is a mix of Mexican, Spanish and Argentina culture the people eating here are all Caucasian, nothing wrong but food is too Americanized and does not have heat. Albóndiga soup has too much cumin and not good beef broth flavor. I am giving it a one star because the combo plate I had was a chile verde enchilada and a chile relleno which both were very good did not eat the rice or beans again not real Mexican. The salad was full of water therefore the dressing list the creaminess and flavor."}
{"text":"This place is is a long standing staple for Hendo folk.  I think a lot of the key here is knowing what is great on the menu to order.  Other reviews mention the Aboldegas soup - it is amazing.  But the rare treat at this place is the shredded beef burrito enchilada style with \"hot\" enchilada sauce on top.  To me that is the specialty and I have never had anything like it - I order it every time.  Service has always been good."}
{"text":"food has gone downhill. and prices super high. Basic lunch for two people with 3 beers, two shots of tequila, two lunch plates and two burritos to go was over $80 last time. insane. We used to come here every Tuesday night for years."}
{"text":"We eat here a lot, and it seems like each time has gotten worse in terms of both food and service. We were seated in the corner, and then forgotten.drinks took forever. We were ready to order. But than people who came in after us got their orders taken first, food first, chips, etc. Refills were slow, and non existent until we were ready to leave. Sorry but I wanted a drink to go with my food, not to enjoy while I pay my bill. Good was disappointing as well. Salsa was glorified tomato sauce. Chips were stale. Chimi.was pretty much empty. Edible, but if I hadn't eaten here successfully many times before, I wouldn't be back. Hopefully whatever they are dealing with changes. Maybe new cooks, servers, etc, but if it's not great the next time, we are moving our Mexican food cravings to be fulfilled elsewhere."}
{"text":"This restaurant borders on that precious fine line between \"hole in the wall\" and dump. The parking lot was atrocious - potholes, uneven pavement and rocks all over the place.  We decided to give it a try after locking our doors and taking all of our valuables out of the car. 

To our surprise, the manager (the young woman with the short hair) was welcoming and asked us to sit wherever we liked.  There was no host/hostess stand so the responsibility of seating fell on whoever was up front.  We sat near the restrooms -which was a mistake for several reasons. First, our party of 5 was around two uneven tables that were pushed together. The tables were missing paint, and had scratches throughout. In addition, the smell of urine from the bathrooms crept around the corner and hovered around us during our entire meal.
 
On a positive note, the chips and salsa were very good. El Torito managed to limit the spice level (for those that can't handle the heat) but still deliver on flavor. However, the entrees that followed were not that great. I chose the Chile Verde dinner with rice and beans. The pork was shredded and was swimming in grease. The dish itself tasted OK--but the grease started overtaking my rice and beans. Speaking of rice, it was on point. There was no sign of vegetables in the rice, but it was fluffy and seasoned perfectly.  On the other hand, the beans were a mess. I have tasted better beans out of that Rosarita can.  Don't try and fool me by slopping cheddar cheese over the top-they were still horrible. 

My wife ordered the tacquitos. Ewwwwww!  I took a bit of that chicken tacquito and immediately spit it out.  Gross!  

If the food was better, I would call Guy Fieri and let him know that I found a \"dive\" worth checking out.  However, I am leaning more toward shutting this eye sore down and heading the other way-into Las Vegas for authentic Mexican food.  

BTW--they do not make their own tortillas here. That's just bad business. ...."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, I do not agree. I am Hispanic and was looking for an authentic meal. I ordered the Chili Verde meal. The rice was 'different' and the beans tasted and looked microwaved- right out of can with a toss of cheese. The Chili Verde was not good. Almost like the pork was cooked separately then a toss of hatch chili thrown on it. 

I appreciate this lady trying to keep her family business going and it must be quite difficult for her but she must look for another cook. Sorry, I hate being negative, but maybe someone needs to let her know."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me, knows Mexican food is like a second child to me. I just love it that much. Its rare I dislike a well cooked Mexican dish. Other than Lengua and intestines, I pretty much eat it all. I love hole in the wall spots such as this one, or fancy unique styles like Border Grill equally. EL Torito Cafe, welcome to my list of well loved mexican restaurants. 
My boyfriend talked of this place from his childhood that was almost to Boulder City way south on Boulder Highway. He figured it wasn't still there but we are the type of people to drive out there and find out. His very much astonished face answered my question if this was the same place. 
My go to dish always has and will be cheese enchiladas and albondigas soup. Ok the soup. Very different from what I expect albondigas to be. Its just broth, and rice filled meatballs. Where's the onions? Zucchini? Carrots? Potatoes? And all the cool garnishes like cilantro and red peppers?!
Although this broth and meatballs indeed was delicious, I could only imagine the potential with veggies. 
Now on to the best freakin cheese enchiladas ever devoured through this mouth!! I don't know that I will ever order anything else. My boyfriends wet chimichanga looked desiring but still. All I can think about ever, are these enchiladas. You have the option of ordering the spicy. (WHY DOESN'T EVERYWHERE HAVE THIS OPTION??) And the cheese inside is melted and high quality. Not like that get stuck in your throat cuz its half melted and too cheesy type. 
The customer service is great, regardless if the waitresses only know enough english to take your order. They work hard, and do a better job then most. They are closed Mondays. And it gets busy during lunch hour. 
You may get addicted. You've been warned."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge Mexican fan really, I'm more Asian/Japanese fan myself but that's okay. I was happily surprised! This is the one and only place I found that I enjoy the \"Shredded beef\" I usually hate that shit because it taste weird, but here it was so flavorful like a soft beef jerky almost ; soo good! Lol  I came here with my friend Kenny as his going away dinner he is going to Elko for college so we went to see a movie and dinner.
I got-
Cheese enchilada- Cheesy it was okay, didn't know what to expect really. The red sauce was super flavorful.

Beef chimichanga This is where the shredded beef comes in, everything about this damn thing was good the outside was nice and crispy, cheese and red sauce melted over it mm mmm mmm is all I can say about this! 

Kenny got -
Pork chimichanga- he enjoyed it ate the whole damn thing, that little piggy!

Nachos granda- We got it without guacamole, we got this to share and ate it all almost. It came with chips, ground beef, sour cream, tomatoes, cheese, jalapenos, and other stuff we got without like olives.

Fries- He got fries to eat with everything and they were yummy nice and crispy.

Desert - We got fried iceccream! They had frosted flakes on it wich where a little chewy but good! :3 

The only downside to this place is I asked for no beans and rice, and they gave it to me anyway, it's okay next time I'll try to make it more clear. The thing I LOVE about this place is EVERYTHING is made fresh, nothing frozen.!"}
{"text":"My family and friends love this place! Great prices and great food. I love the enchiladas and my husband loves the burritos there. They are fast and friendly. It's off the beaten path but well worth seeking it out. Some of the best reasonably priced Mexican food on town!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food we have found in the Las Vegas area.  Authentic . . .Mexican food that we were used to having in So CA.   We had the Carnitas Plate and the Chicken Burrito Plate.  Both were very good.  Service was a bit slow, but they were very apologetic.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice based on glowing recommendations by locals.  Each time I was overwhelmingly unimpressed.  

As far as Yelp goes this has to be one of the more overrated restaurants on it.  4 stars!  This place is half a star above a Robertos taco shop on its best day.  I will say though, they always have a packed parking lot and seem to have a very loyal base of customers.  I always ask myself when I pass it; is it because the food is so good, or is it because they are no restaurants within a 5 mile radius of this place?  

The food is average and not made with the finest nor freshest of ingredients.  Sure it is cool that they serve albondigas, but it is a half hearted effort.  Once you have the chips and salsa you might as well walk out because you are in for a parade of dull/bland dishes to follow.  

So a 4 star place this is not.  If you are craving some mexican and you live nearby, I say give it a shot.  But, if you have to venuture to this desolate destination I would say you can go with any of the other run of the mill mexican joints you pass along the way.  

*One more thing did a guy really knock this place for having a bad salad with RANCH dressing?  A side salad at a mexican restaurant....who knew?"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great time. I will definitely recommend El Torito to friends and family."}
{"text":"I give this zero stars the service is horrible. We waited over 30 minutes to have our order take  and had to ask them to take it. The hostesses was very unfriendly wouldn't even acknowledge a thank you after giving drinks and straws.  Then waited another 45 minutes and still no food. Eventually walked out and as we are leaving we told the cashier that we aren't waiting any longer and we are leaving and won't be back and she just smiles and laughs. Don't waste your time on this place. Zero stars"}
{"text":"We're from California just stopping in to see the dam and we just happened to stop by this little hole in the wall today. The food is actually really good and the service was great. We will be returning for sure maybe as soon as tomorrow on the way back home."}
{"text":"Man so good!  Food was excellent.  I had the shredded beef enchilada and the green chile...both outstanding.  My wife had the beef fajitas.  Unfortunately we were both full when the entrees arrived because we were chowing on the chips and yummy salsa.   

We'll be back but it won't be for the atmosphere nor the quick service.  Everyone was friendly but not in a hurry."}
{"text":"I usually love this place but last night they were really off. We were there 2 hours and it never should have taken so long. We waited 20 minutes to be seated although the table we sat at was empty the entire time.  

The person seating was also in charge of taking orders and taking payments.  This is not acceptable. This was not the usual person there - maybe the usual person was off for the holiday weekend. Whatever the case, this person wasn't able to keep up.  It took forever to order. We were seated for nearly 20 minutes before someone took our order. Food took forever to come out.

The food was also off last night. Rice and beans didn't seem to taste quite the same. My taco crispy taco was soggy - presumably from the chicken they didn't drain before putting in it.

Normally I would give this place a solid 4 stars - not because of the ambiance or great setting, but because the food is usually so darn tasty. Last night they barely made 2 stars."}
{"text":"My family, friends and I have been coming here for 30+ yrs. Absolutely amazing Mexican food. As I always say its the best food north of the border. Must try the albondigas soup."}
{"text":"A yummy little gem in the desert. This family owned restaurant caters to a lot of Henderson locals and is also a great place to hit after a day at the lake! It's been around for almost 40 years and has authentic and yummy recipes! Their chips and salsa are to die! I love their green chili pork enchiladas and rice. Most everything I've tasted there has been great. We have been going there for over 15 years and tell everyone about it! Definitely worth the drive even if you don't live in Henderson! :) Denise and Gia work their butts off to provide good service and good food!"}
{"text":"Located just off the end of Boulder Highway, the building this restaurant is located at looks like the Bates Motel, and I thought Norman Bates was going to greet me.    From the outside, a normal person would be a little worried to enter this place, but I had a Groupon coupon for this restaurant, and I always wanted to checkout this place.   I have to admit, I tried to get my friends and family to come with me, but they were always hesitant to take the turn off the road.

Somehow, I got one of my friends to come with me, and we walked in around 230 pm, and I was immediately greeted by a young Mexican woman, seated, and given a nice bowl of chips and salsa before even ordering a drink.   I have to say, It was pretty darn good!  and a nice way to get you thirsty.

 The place looks way different inside than outside, and it wasn't modern, but it's a family style restaurant with a full bar.    The waitress can talk English, but it obviously it's not their first language, but who cares, it's not Norman Bates I'm ordering from..

We ordered the Chicken Chimichanga, and a Carne Asada plate;  but for some reason, I kept on eating the chips and salsa..   It was pretty addicting, and then a few minutes later, the waitress bought the salad.   I wasn't nothing great, and I put it on side for my Chimichanga to come.    I have to say, I was quite surprised it was pretty good!   a little spicy, but  was pretty bold for this dish.   My friend gave me a piece of  the Carne Asada, and it was better than my chimi.   I guess, the cook could take his time on my order because of dead zone of 245 p.m. which is any restaurants least busiest time. 

This place is not a restaurant to impress a date, unless you want to scare the hell of that person because of it's first impression, but on the other hand, you might make a fan out that person for their food."}
{"text":"The place is literally on the way out of to towards Boulder City and in the middle of nowhere . Great Mexican food, wonderful Salsa and a pretty good full bar. One of the best Mexican restaurants in town and it's family owned. I go there often and never had language problems there and wait staff has always been friendly and efficient ."}
{"text":"Absolutely adore this place. I love the atmosphere, such a small, old fashioned feeling and I enjoy every second of it. The staff is always smiling and seems like they are having a good time. Makes your visit that much better. The food is great, I always get the veggie burrito dry with sour cream & guac on the side. They pack that tortilla and I can barely finish it most of the time. My favorite Mexican place. :)"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food. I love how the food is so hot the cheese and sauce are still bubbling on the plate when they bring it to the table! Much like Cali Mexican food. Not foo-foo \"fresh mex.\" They do the basics well. Enchiladas are great, chips/salsa are rockin; good, and many people order the chile verde pork burrito. The Albondigas soup is the best soup around. Very basic, but delicious. Will cure any ailment (excellent for a cold or flu)! 

Casual place, easy for kids and picky adults to find a great dish. Popular for breakfast, closed on Mondays and some holidays (a week at Christmas time). 

Easy to locate off the 95/wagonwheel exit, off boulder hwy next to the gun shop."}
{"text":"I love this place! I drive by it pretty frequently and decided to stop in a try it with some friends on a Saturday night which turned out to be really busy. We were still seated fairly quickly but there was a small wait while they waited for tables to be cleared so we could push them together. Our server was friendly and our food came out quickly for how busy they were. Someone at our table ordered the albondigas soup and said it was excellent, the rest of the table had salads which weren't all that great but it's just a regular salad. 

This place doesn't look like much from the outside but they put out some really great food!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years, and absolutely love it. It's newly remodeled, and looks bright, and modern as well. 
The food here is always amazing, and the staff is very attentive. 
I had the chimichanga, and added the green pork chili sauce to it... It was Sooo good! My wife had the green Chile pork burrito. Both were delicious, and even the leftovers tasted amazing the next day! The chips and salsa is always our favorite, and I believe it's a family recipe that's made fresh daily. 
Definitely would recommend this place to anyone who loves authentic, large portioned Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"Who knew????  Seriously, the best little hole in the wall Mexican restaurant I've come across in a long, long time. Full disclosure, there's nothing fancy, sophisticated or swank here. But man oh man, the food is superb. They offer the obligatory chips and salsa. The chips are run of the mill but the salsa is good. It's simple and will satisfy all levels of spicy tolerance - a hint of heat but not scorching. My dining companions each ordered a chimichanga, one had chicken, the other carnitas. To be honest, neither of them were all that impressed with the chimis but I had so much food that I shared with them. On future visits (and there will be plenty), they now know what to get. I got the 2 combination plate with a chili rellano and a green chili pork enchilada. The rellano was outstanding - cheesy, slightly spicy, with just the right amount of breading. I got it wet with a red sauce and it was perfect. They offer it dry but the red sauce was so good I don't think I'd want it any other way. The green chili pork enchilada was amazing - perfectly cooked pork, not dry at all, just the right amount of cheese, the top smothered with cheese - but not too much. The rice and beans were typical - nothing to write home about but not bad, either. We got a fried ice cream to share and it was good - I've had better but I definitely didn't turn my spoon away from it, either. 

As far as customer service, the bussers, servers, food runners and cashiers were all very helpful and friendly. We didn't wait long for our food and anything we asked for was given to us promptly. We were there at 7pm on a Friday night and it was pretty busy. The dining room is fairly small - maybe around 15 tables and booths so it's not a stretch to say that you may have to wait for a table - but we got sat right away and didn't notice anyone that had to wait. Only thing that was annoying was that they don't take American Express - good thing I had cash. 

Bottom line, if you're looking for a Mexican  restaurant with great food and service, this is a good bet. If you're looking for something hip, trendy and snobby, go elsewhere. We won't miss you!"}
{"text":"Extra point for staff and service. Had a groupon that made it a great deal. No frills US-Mex. Pretty good salsa, relleno was very good. I would come back."}
{"text":"I literally book my plane flights home to Vegas to ensure I am able to make it to El Toretos. I now live in SD and there is nothing in the state that has come close to El Toretos. Greats staff, family owned for 40 plus years and the best food on the planet. 

THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD ON EARTH! 

No close second."}
{"text":"Best salsa and red enchilada sauce in town. Could drink both. Love family owned small businesses that take pride in their work. New fave!!"}
{"text":"Didnt think it was anyruing worth going back for. Bland salsa, cheap quality food and cleanliness no bueno. The service was great and affordable but unfortunately not impressed with the food."}
{"text":"El Torito used to be good, I have been going there since I was a kid.  Lately, past few years, it has been getting worse and worse. Meals come out cold half the time, portions are smaller (specifically the rice and beans which are not half of what they use to be) and the service is not that good.  Servers are friendly but they rarely remember to bring your soup or anything else you ask for (every time we go there not just once or twice) and are slow as hell.  My mother in laws enchiladas kick El Torito's enchiladas asses.  Food is just not that great, not authentic as some here claim and is continually getting worse.  Hopefully they can eventually change this and right the ship, as I use to love El Torito."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner last night. My husband stayed with his usual fajitas. Delicious as always! I got the fish tacos for the first time and they were yummy! We left feeling like we were going to explode! The service is ALWAYS on point! They treat you like family."}
{"text":"Good food.  Wait staff was super friendly and funny.  Good variety on the menu.  We went on a Saturday night and had to wait a few minutes before being seated, but we quickly understood why they were busy.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Small little place looks like a whole in the wall but the food was amazing such a great way to spend our cinco de mayo"}
{"text":"This restaurant is not the best. The appearance on the outside is not as good as the inside. The people are very very nice except the one lady in the front :( The food...absolutely disgusting! Nasty tamales, burned meat its just gross. I do admire the free chips and dip though... Their guacamole is the only good thing there... 
Overall, this restaurant is not a good place to eat at all... :("}
{"text":"I live near El Torito and I have given it a chance again last night with my daughter. I've been here about 3-4 times. And each time the food is not impressive at all. I am really confused how anyone could rate it 5 stars. Very very dry chicken every visit. Food defiantly does not taste homemade at all. It's edible, but not fresh. 

The only reason I like this place is it's small mom and pop type feel...the people who work there are super nice, service is always pleasant. However, food is just not enough for me to go back again, unfortunately. Our stomachs were not feeling good after this either."}
{"text":"We hit El Torito on our way out of Vegas and, being Sunday morning, it was almost a relief to see the unassuming exterior as we could be assured that there would be no wait. We were correct and found ourselves promptly seated in a dated mexican food restaurant. Food was good, service was good, and prices were fair -- only ding is that they messed up Jenny's order (I suspect the server didn't ask for clarification when she was confused).

Definitely a worthwhile stop if you have a half-day drive back to Arizona or California ahead of you."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Great food, good prices, great service. This place is an all around win."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef Fajitas and they were fantastic. Restaurant had no ambiance and needs to be updated. Went with family. Not going back because they forgot the salad for family and dressing was watery."}
{"text":"I hate for this rate to be so low because the service and kindness we've received here has been great...truly. That being said the food seems super microwaved and not fresh. It's a bummer because we want to love it here as it is super convenient but it's just subpar at best. Also, it's really overpriced in our opinion and I get that they are probably in an higher priced area as well as trying to make some moola but it just doesn't compute. We've tried it about 4 times now...and not saying we won't return via convenience but I wouldn't recommend or take visitors here as a first choice. Sorry to say it because we have had such kind servers."}
{"text":"Best of the old time longstanding Henderson restaurants for good reason: Excellent authentic tasty Mexican cuisine. Service can be a bit slow when things become extra busy at El Torito. However, if this happens, they are always apologetic and polite, plus the food is so good that its worth the wait. The dining area over on the far left side is roomy enough to handle a large party of maybe 20 to 25 guests. They also have private window booths for romantic couples out to enjoy extra tasty home cooked Mexican food. You gotta try the Albondigas Soup at least once in your lifetime; it is so tasty, filling and delicious! Some of the tables and chairs might squeak a little bit sometimes, but overall this place is kept clean, the staff is very friendly, your order is taken with a smile, and when it arrives at your table served piping hot, it smells wonderful!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  The decor is old but the food is good"}
{"text":"Food was okay, slow service. We were sat right next to the kitchen when there were plenty of seats around. The silverware was dirty and when we asked for more it was just more dirty silverware. Not worth the money or the wait."}
{"text":"So this was my first time here. My husband had been before. I was excited to try it. We were seated took us a bit to figure out what we wanted. We ordered, 10 mins later another family is seated. 20 mins later that family is getting their food...where's ours? Then the waitress comes out and apologizes and says that she forgot to hit the button on the computer that inputs our order. At least she was honest...we had Yes  3-4 baskets of chips before our food came lol. 
The food was still delicious. The waitress made an honest mistake and at least admitted to it. We'd still give it another try"}
{"text":"Good place for true Mexican food. The location is strange far off, but don't let that stop you from trying their food. The food is excellent and the wait staff is very friendly, great customer service. The price is very fair."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for over 20 years amd the food quality, flavor, and service has been consistently amazing. Love the albondigas"}
{"text":"Good food & service but there are flies flying all over the place, totally gross if you ask me."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! it may be a little hole in the wall with tacky decor but its awesome. :)"}
{"text":"WOW!!! Amazing food good service this place is definitely a Dimond in the ruff my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Our 3rd time was last night and unfortunately that comment is 2 fold. We won't be back. Gad we wanted it to be 'our place for Mexican'. Disappointed

We're new here to Nevada and previously had a favorite Mexican restaurant we went to probably 2-3+ times a month, hoped to find a replacement. Had gone to a local Mexican restaurant didn't like it, then found another also local it was ok but nothing special either.  

El Torito was a chain in Calif that was awful so didn't go into this one for quite awhile. Same in name only I suppose. One day early afternoon we thought what the heck and it was okay not bad not exceptional either. We went again a few weeks later for dinner, again not great but (to us anyway) average at best. 

Not much atmosphere basically a no frills or ambiance basic restaurant inside and kinda plain boring not inviting appearing outside as well.  Again still there for Mexican food. Last night I ordered a #1 taco beans rice hubby ordered a #2 taco enchilada rice salad beans  a glass of wine and reg house margarita.
No color on plate, plastic plate not a speck of color on plate not even a piece of tomato or sprig of parsley, don't you eat with your eyes first? Hubby's the same, no color, no visual appeal.  Not good size (portions) either (not much food). 

I got the bill and thought 'that' price for 'that'  meal.  Sorry to us not good Mexican food, or it was an off night. Either way unfortunately we won't be back."}
{"text":"Solid food. Everything on this menu bursts with flavor. I'm not a fan of red sauce and that's all they have here, however, it is unlike any other red sauce I've had...I LOVE IT! Their carne asada has a delicious flavor to it as well!"}
{"text":"Was turned onto this place by a friend. When you walk in, you get this Truck Stop, dirty, dingy type of a feel. This has never scared me because most of the times, these places have the best food! (Check out Polaris Cafe behind the Rio All-Suites Hotel and Casino! Best breakfast!)

Sat down and everything appears to be a tad old and run down. But, the service was pretty decent. You could tell these people aren't corporate, and I don't mind that at all. 

I ordered the veggie burrito, wet (with enchilada sauce) and half with hot sauce and the other half with regular. I like my food hot and this was HOT!!! At first I thought I wasn't going to be able to handle, but then I adapted. LIke I said, I like my food HOT!!

The burrito tasted as if it were prepared by someone who knows Mexican food, and not by someone trained to cook and emulate it. My overall experience was that even thought it aint the prettiest or cleanest place, the food more than makes up for it. I say at least give it a shot and judge for yourself. Will I eat here again? As Dave Hester would say...\"YUUUP!\""}
{"text":"The food was authentic, fairly priced & outstanding! Portion sizes are WOW! They offer menu items that aren't Mexican food...burgers, chicken fingers, grilled cheese so the kids were all happy too! The wait staff were all very polite & attentive & worked well as a team for our table of 4 adults & 11 kids 11 & under!! Most places balk when you walk in the door with that many people, let alone over double the children to the adults but they were happy to rearrange tables to accommodate us & make us welcome. Everyone enjoyed their meals & ate well. I had the chili verde, it was tender & juicy & had a nice kick for the level of spice! Perfect! The guacamole was the only thing that wasn't perfect, just avocados mashed up, but their salsa was delicious so it wasn't hard to doctor it up. Out of the way of Boulder Hwy but so worth the drive!"}
{"text":"have to say. not very good anymore.
what a shame. The food is just not the same as it used to be a while back."}
{"text":"As far as places to eat near the downtown of Henderson there is not a lot to choose from that are not fast food.  My wife and I really enjoy good Mexican food and we had not found one we liked since moving to Henderson. A co-worker had given their recommendation for El-Torito as a great place to eat that has very good authentic food. Once I got my wife to go in and try it she is now hooked.  This is a once a week treat for us. It is a bit pricey but I will pay more for a good meal if I know the consistency will be there.  I don't think we have gone there when there were not at least 10 cars parked out front at any given time.  Sometimes double that.  It's a good indication of a great place to eat."}
{"text":"It took at least 10 mins before even being noticed and then another 10-15 to be seated. I asked for an appetizer and beans for the chips. They never came. The booth is torn up and there is duct tape holding it together. There are only 3 servers today I don't know if that is normal but the food is not very good. Paired with the horrible service and poor atmosphere.. I will never return."}
{"text":"My favorite hole in the wall Mexican spot! Best Mexican food since moving from Northern  California. All the meats are marinated well. And the sauces are fabulous. I would have given 5 stars but, the service is normally slow and they don't fully listen to what you ordered."}
{"text":"El Torito Cafe is a very good place to enjoy a good lunch or dinner with the family. Their Green Chile Pork Enchilada and Tacos was very good and tasty, left a very pleasant feeling my tummy. The staff was very friendly and the service was excellent. Indeed I will going back in the future to try out some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Good quality, tasty Mexican food at a very reasonable price. However the service is hit or miss, and they occasionally run out of different menu items. Your best bet is to go there during slower hours... If the parking lots is jam packed, you will most likely get slower service.

My personal favorite is the chicken chimi, served wet with all the garnishes. So tasty. Goes perfect with a pitcher of margaritas."}
{"text":"Fast service...we were in & out of there in about an hour. I noticed they had like 2 server's...so we didn't have the GREATEST service...but that's understandable. Great salsa & chips. Hubs & son got the taco & enchilada combo...which they loved. My fajita meal was okay. Most of the onions were burned & my carne asada was way overcooked! But, I love the fact that they've been family owned since 1975! And the prices are good!"}
{"text":"My son, my daughter-in-law and myself got food poisoning.  So sick, will never go there again.  Very slow service, and very incompetent.  The only person that ever came back and checked on us was the bus person.  Place is so outdated!!"}
{"text":"We live this family owned, local restaurant. We eat here at least 3 times per month. Great food, great people"}
{"text":"Really good food, lately.  Very consistent and has been a weekly \"craving\" which I can count on being a good meal every time I come in."}
{"text":"First-time visit was great very authentic family Mexican food. I had a great dinner and even went back two days later for breakfast. Chorizo and eggs was awesome  The chili Reino   was perfect even the refried beans and rice are great not just typical"}
{"text":"Great mom and pop restaurant. Awesome salsa and the cheese enchiladas are to die for, which is saying something because you rarely find a Mexican restaurant that makes their enchilada sauce from scratch, which is the only way I like it! I tell everyone about it!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food, the Margaritas, the service are always excellent! The green Chile burrito... Yum! Like being in New Mexico. Everything we have tried has been delicious!"}
{"text":"So I have to drive to by this place every day to go to work  and It is always PACKED. A majority of the time there is at least one cop car...WHICH IS  ALWAYS A GOOD SIGN lol. It is in the middle of nowhere, It is small, not the nicest of amenities but the food was good. I got their carnitas platter and let me tell you the quality of their food is GREAT...good meat and fresh veggies. A little pricey for just a family restaurant. But overall I would come back. CHIPS AND SALSA ARE YUMMS"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food. I had a craving and was beyond surprised to find amazing Mexican food in Henderson. The service was subpar at best though. When we visited they were very busy, but our waitress never took our order. We had to flag down another waiter to put in our food order and had to flag down yet another waiter to grab our food from the kitchen. 

We will probably visit again based on how great the food was, but I can only hope the service improves."}
{"text":"I've lived here for 7 years and had given up on great Mexican food. Not baja cuisine or a balsamic glazed carne asana in a port reduction....Mexican soul food, enchiladas and albondigas, chile rellano, and chimis, all of it completely excellent. We were completely satisfied. Love love love it. I'll be a repeat customer for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for some family dinner but I'm unsure if the occasion. They had just reopened after their remodel. I had the chicken fajita skillet. It was good and you could tell fresh. Their complimentary chips and salsa were also a hit. I just moved closer so I imagine my fiance and I will probably be back."}
{"text":"We've been going to El Torito since I was a kid. Now I live 2,000 miles away in Ohio and only get my tasty shredded beef tacos once a year when I visit my family.  When it's freezing cold in Dayton and we have 3 feet of snow outside I crave the albondigas soup. My dad calls it \"dirty dishwater soup\" but looks are deceiving! It is a simple, tasty, satisfying soup. The salsa is awesome too with a good shake of salt. Some people might find the service abrupt, but I've always found the staff friendly, efficient and accommodating (even though we always show up with a big group and linger over our once-a-year whole-family El Torito excursion). 

For those of you knocking it: It's a small family place with tasty food and a devoted (and not trendy) following... if that's not good enough for you then feel free to take your business to one of those character-less chain food places with their corporate-mandated \"friendliness\"... it just means I'll get my table faster."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here thinking we would be surprised. Like one of those hidden mom and pop restaurants. We were less than impressed. I think I could make better Mexican food.  the complimentary chips were stale. The \"quesadilla\" was a a tortilla with some cheese and a couple pieces of meat on top it. Needless to say we won't be making a return trip here!"}
{"text":"This place has wonderful reviews from their loyal customers. I'd like to appreciate this place for what it is. So what is it? This is a restaurant that has been serving this area of Henderson since dinosaurs roamed the Earth. Every older neighbor in my part of Water Street District has raved about them. So they're an integrated part of society here. They serve solidly average Mexican food. It's probably gone downhill a little on quality. The decor is funky. The wait-staff is generally personable. 

My salad, as another person has described on a review, was filled with water, small, and straight out of a bag with some cheese on it. It's ok - it's Mexican food. I don't think Robertos even HAS a salad. I shouldn't really be expecting an amazing salad if I am trying to order authentic Mexican food. 

My beans were so-so. They kind of tasted ... old. My rice was dry and flavorless. Our table wobbled. 

So why even give them three stars? My chimichanga was AWESOME. I got it smothered in red sauce, and the result was something that I can't begin to describe. I never like red sauce. I absolutely abstain from ordering enchiladas at Mexican restaurants because I hate that sauce so much. I've only ever liked it at one place, in California. But I took a gamble and I adored it. 

So did my husband. And he's picky. Way-picky. The kind of picky that won't try new places with me unless I beg or threaten bodily harm. The kind of picky that requires us to end up picking up pizza after we eat at a friends' house if they're serving something he doesn't like. The kind of picky that always orders the same thing wherever he goes. He said it was the second best enchilada sauce he's ever had. (Next to mine, of course.) For him to say that means I would take him back here simply for enchiladas. That is why they get three stars. They will have my business simply because they do one super-important thing better than anywhere else. You can't knock that."}
{"text":"I love this place!  My husband and I have been going to this restaurant for over 20 years.  The service is alway great and the food is even better:) it's a hole in the wall but don't judge.  Just because it's not a fancy building doesn't mean it's not a great restaurant.  My favs are the smothered chile rellleno or ground beef crunchy tacos.  Thanks El Torito!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate there last night. It was our first visit and probably our last. When we walked in our first interaction was with Gia, she had a bad attitude. Apparently she was the manager last night. She then came over to take our order, again terrible attitude. The food was good. I had the smothered carne asada dinner plate and my husband had the chicken enchiladas. The food runner was great, good customer service from him. In my opinion, If you cannot be kind to guests, you should be in the back of the house. I left feeling angry and disappointed. I am giving this place 1 star because of my experience with her."}
{"text":"Never again.  We have heard a few people mention this place and thought \"hey, this one of those run-down places that makes up for it with incredible food.\" Nope, it's just dingy.  The food is very average.  For example, my fajitas had not one single red pepper.  Very basic meat, onions, green peppers. We both got fajitas and yet the bill for two of us with no drinks came to $30!  No atmosphere at all.  The staff was fine, but she charged us for a substitution that should have been free (shredded lettuce instead of rice, beans and tortillas).  

Anyway, even though we live close we'll never go back there."}
{"text":"Love the food and been coming here for over 15 years, but once again service was horrible. Tried to call in an order and was put on hold for 15 min which was enough time for me just to drive down there. Oh and by hold I mean the waitress just put the phone in her pocket and continued to just help other guests. So when I get there and informed her she can probably just hang up the phone now she just laughed. Excuse is oh we're busy..... no you're under staffed and horrible trained. Place has a lot more potential.  Would give the food 5 stars. The staff gets one star. 1 waitress and one busser for 17 tables. Not the waitress fault, it's on manager/ owner... only losing money."}
{"text":"My husband and his bestfriend who happens to be my bro in law (he married my sister lol) ALWAYS raved about el Toritos. They've been going there since high school. We finally went, the food was good!!  The smothered pork burrito w green sauce was SO good and huge!! Can't wait to go again!! :-)"}
{"text":"Beyond the language barrier, the food is delicious.  The tacos are hearty and ingredients fresh.  When I ask for a side of pico de gallo and jalapenos, they really dish out the sides.  They don't have pico pre-made, but I was given cilantro, onions and tomatoes in separate souffle cups.

Unfortunately, the last time I stopped in for lunch take away, there was a bit of a problem with the language barrier.  I ended up with jalapeno POPPERS, not jalapenos for my tacos. I knew this was a mix up because of the total bill, but I decided rather than trying to explain I just sucked it up.  (I tried one of the poppers, WAY TOO OVER FRIED.)

Beyond all that, I tried Fausto's the other day on the suggestion of Yelp! and was disappointed. I'll stick with El Torito and take my chances.

I'm being generous, because of how awesome the food was the first time. (try the carne asada!)"}
{"text":"Went to this place since it was close to our house, but I wasn't all that impressed. Fine if you want simple Mexican food, but I've had much better for the value."}
{"text":"I recently went back to El Torito for lunch, I regret doing so. 
1: Salsa: When you make your salsa daily you can expect to have the occasional batch that goes wrong. But what they put on the table looked like a can of Hunt's tomato sauce with maybe a couple of jalapenos put in at best. It was tomato paste with extra water and it's wrong to call it salsa.  
2: They do know how to make real Pork Green Chile. That is the ONLY thing saving them from a 1 star review this time. 
3: Way, WAY overpriced. An enchilada, a taco, standard beans and rice and a soft drink came out to $14. Yep, I double checked the receipt. I felt like I got fleeced.  

At least the place is clean and the servers hustle, but you don't go here to stare at the walls or the server, you go to eat. And the food quality quite frankly isn't a good value anymore. Look elsewhere for your Mexican fix."}
{"text":"If you like Mexican food cooked the lazy way then this place is for you. Cold meat on the nachos, Pico de Gallo has huge chunks of tomatoes and onions with no cilantro and no lime and flavor at all."}
{"text":"We went for an after work dinner the other night with a Groupon.  What a deal not only do we get the great Mexican food this place has to offer, the good service, but we got a good deal with the coupon to boot.  I hope they repeat that deal!

When we arrived there were only two other tables seated but by the time the rest of the party arrived the restaurant was almost full.  By this time it was almost 5:30.  With the inrush of diners the wait for food was a little longer than usual but we were kept busy with an ample supply of fresh chips and salsa.  Hmmmm, salsa.  The servers here tend to take care of everyone and are not dedicated to certain tables.  We were asked frequently if we needed anything, but not to the point it was annoying.

Our food arrived bubbling hot with generous portions.  Several of us got the pick two deal which was enough for me.  Typical Mexican faire rice here, tasty but could have been ramped up a bit.  I would add some onions and take it up a notch with some peppers or something, do something unusual since this is a mon-and-pop shop.  The enchiladas and sauce very flavorful.  Lot's of cheese and no hesitation when one in our party ordered extra, with no extra charge.  I like the texture of the refried beans here, they are not runny and soupy like some places serve them.  I wish there had been a little more of them on the plate though.  We ordered a garnish plate, $3.50 extra, and that could have been a little better stocked.  The guacamole is good but could have been a little more of it. Ok, I really mean a lot more of it.  I like guacamole!

The one thing that was less than satisfying were the fish tacos.  They use Mahi-mahi which I generally like but this was served a bit dry.  Perhaps a little more of the garnish and sauce would have remedied that.

Last note: the outside may be a bit of a distraction for some but the inside is clean.  

Overall a good experience.  And yes we will be back, even if they do not make another Groupon appearance."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was little. The food is good and the salsa has a good kick to it. Service can be a little slow but it's understandable because of how busy it is."}
{"text":"This place was great, they totally accommodate gluten-free, food is wonderful and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"It would be a \"5\" if the Chef had not fried my chimichanga too long. Taste was still great, excellent white meat chicken-smothered in red sauce. Rice some of the best I've ever had and beans were tasty as well. My wife had green pork burrito and it was fantastic. We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  The service was slow, the food was sub par, AND I found a hair in my food.

I was ready to track down the management, but I didn't want to get into it with them.  My parents and I were visiting my sister and her family who live in Henderson, and we didn't want to spoil the vibe.  I don't normally give out such terrible reviews, but this one was earned."}
{"text":"This was a pretty good mexican food place, I gotta say. The chips and salsa was good but the chile could have used more heat. I ordered the cheese enchiladas w/ hot (comes in either hot or mild) enchilada sauce. It was a bit too hot, if i ordered this again i'd get mild. My bf ordered the shredded beef red chile -which was good, very good, came out just as we pictured it. The rice was good but pretty spicy, gotta say i've never had spicy rice before. The beans were good - and covered in cheese. just like everything else. I would definitely recommend trying this place. I cannot give this place more than 3 stars b/c what kind of mexican restaurant doesn't serve menudo?? and like i said the chile needed more heat.  :)
please note: this place was packed at 11:30 on a saturday afternoon and its all by itself - out pretty far past downtown henderson."}
{"text":"I saw this place had a Groupon so I hopped on Yelp to look at the reviews.  Since they were positive I decided to buy it because the reviewers made me really excited about this place.  What a bust!  I will say that whenever I am excited about a restaurant and I see low reviews, I generally think those people are babies.  It's them that I should have listened too.  And here goes one of the whiners...

The area of town and the outside of the restaurant prompted my wife to comment that she 'felt like she was in another city'.  I thought to myself 'exactly the reason this place is going to be so great'.  Inside was the same story.  The decor was so odd and unflattering that I thought again to myself,'this place is going to be great'!  The sauce all over my menu just sealed it for me.  Greatness!  What I'm trying to say is that if you have 20 or so reviews and you still have 4 stars then I will overlook all of this garbage because you MUST have great food.

After three different people took different orders from us we ended up with our house salad.  Greatest salad ever?  Nope.  The salad had to be from a bag and it was covered (COVERED!) in ranch dressing.  To top it off there was about an inch of water covering the bottom of the bowl.  (I made sure to post a pic of it.)  Gross.  We couldn't even eat it and I was starving!  When they took the salad bowls away they asked why we hadn't eaten it...oh wait, I was dreaming.  They didn't even acknowledge the fact that the salad was untouched.  Then the food came out and I was staring at some round piece of food that was supposed to be a Chile Relleno (Picture).  I have had a number of Chile Rellenos in my day and none of them have ever been round.  I will spare you all the drama to say it was the worst Chile Relleno I've ever eaten.  The sauce was so odd that I couldn't even gag it down.  My wife's enchiladas were also pretty bland/bad.  

I truly cannot even believe this place has 4 stars.  This was the most disappointed I have been in a long time.  I was so excited about this place and I thought it would be a great, hidden place to tell my friends about.  Amigos Cantina at Fiesta Henderson is waaaaay better and they don't have 4 stars.  Come on!"}
{"text":"I'd say the food was 3 stars, but the service bumps it up to 4 stars.  We had lunch at El Torito on a Thursday after reading about it (and passing it on Boulder Highway) for a few years.  I finally bought the Groupon (which is available frequently), and was glad I did.

I found the joint to be very clean.  We were seated immediately and drink orders were immediately taken.  Additionally, the chips (warm) and the salsa (thin, but flavorful and had a little heat) were brought out very quickly.  To eat, my wife had the cheese enchiladas.  I don't know how to describe these other than simple but REALLY good.  Cheesy, great sauce.  They were simple but good, I don't know how else to say it.  I'd definitely order these again.

I had the chicken chimichanga.  I was not as pleased with my dish, thus the 3 stars for the food.  It was dry in the interior of the chimichanga.  I did love the rice and beans, perhaps the best Mexican/Spanish rice I've had a Mexican restaurant like this.

My son had the cheese quesadilla (which they call a cheese crisp) and French fries.  He liked both, but didn't finish either, which is par for the course since he's 3.  They were very understanding of us having a small child, they brought him an extra set of silverware and watered down his apple juice, as we requested.  

I'll definitely return, it's an old school place with simple, but good food.  I will say I like won't get the chicken chimichanga again, I think I'll definitely get some enchiladas next time."}
{"text":"Oh, El Torito you used to be so yummy and now you've dropped off. I've been to El Torito many times over the past 7 years, but in the past year or so it just isn't as good. 

The staff is always friendly and they are super quick even when they are slammed. The atmosphere is nothing to write home about. It's a simple place with some booths as well as tables and chairs. 

I'll give it to them I really enjoyed their chips and salsa. Great flavor to the salsa. It has a hint of spice without being overwhelming. On this recent visit I ordered the tamale with red sauce with a side of beans and rice. Joel ordered a shredded beef chimichanga with rice and beans. The tamale itself was ok, but the red sauce tasted dirty. It just had a seriously bad flavor. Ugh, the beans were super dry and stuck to the plate in a glob and the rice was just non edible. It was dry and had absolutely no taste. Joel's chimichanga looked good, but again lacked flavor. For the price we could have gone to Robertos and spent less and had a better product. 

I feel very sad to give them a 3 star review, but it just wasn't good. If El Torito could return to the old way of cooking they'd have a home run, but for now it's just sad, mediocre Mexican food. What a shame."}
{"text":"Horrible. We have eaten there for years and it has just gotten progressively worse. They have no air conditioning, service is sub standard, food is inconsistent, and the prices don't reflect the quality or portions.  We just don't go there anymore. It's sad."}
{"text":"Yesterday, a bunch of us came to El Torito to cure our hangover.  As you go up Boulder Hwy, make sure you are paying attention, because you will miss this place if you don't.  Talk about a po-dunk humble establishment LOL.

When I walked in, I felt like I wasn't in Vegas anymore.  This place reminded me of some truck stop diner you see on the movies.  We were told to just take a seat somewhere, so we took the booth in the back corner.  A lot of things in this place is dusty.  This place is old.  Dirty forks, long wait.  I mean REALLY long wait.  There were two servers and they seemed all over the place.  

I got the #4 on the breakfast menu for about $8.00.  It was a hamburger patty, eggs, hash brown and toast.  The hamburger patty was so dry I had to smother ketchup on it.  The eggs were done over easy and helped bring some moisture to the burger patty.  The hashbrowns were nicely brown and crispy and the butter came with a side of toast.  SERIOUSLY, a lot of butter.  I could tell what the toast tasted like LOL.  

The people I went with grew up in Vegas and old Henderson.  I understand this place must have been a familiar place to them growing up.  For me, I wasn't impressed at all.  I might be back to try some actual Mexican food, but believe me.  It's definitely NOT on my top priorities."}
{"text":"Expected a lot less upon entering here but looks can be deceiving, it was great! We were seated immediately although the place was packed we got lucky and did not have to wait. Staff was quick and helpful. During the meal(other restaurants should take note) the staff, all of them asked how we were doing and if we needed anything. They kept our drinks (water) full and we never once had to search put our server to get more of anything. I see a few bad reviews here citing bad service and have to think they have never been to any other restaurants in Vegas because this service was the best we have ever had. The food is \"old\" school Mexican food made with the same recipes handed down for three generations. This place has been here for over 40 years, they are doing something right."}
{"text":"Homestyle mexican food, ooey, gooey, cheesy deliciousness served up in a hole in the wall, what could be better?!! 
We finally gave this place a try after living here for 4 years & idk why it took us so long. 
I always order a chile relleno at every Mexican restaurant I try. That's my gage of how good their food is. Such a simple food but so easy to mess up. 
Not only was the amount of batter perfect, not too thick & had that airiness to it that it should, they clean up the pepper 1st. They remove all the seeds, ribs & stems! I've never seen that before & its such a small thing, but very appreciated when scarfing down all that cheesy fried chile goodness. The crowning glory tho is the optional sauce that they cover it in. Please get the sauce. It's amazing. Idk how else to describe it. I asked our waitress (who also happened to be the owner) what it was & she said it was just their enchilada sauce, secret family recipe of course! I've never had enchilada sauce like this. It has a richness to it that I've never tasted in any enchilada sauce that I've ever had before. 
We've been a few times now & every time it's been amazing. They claim to be known for their green chile which I've had & while it is pretty tasty, I think they should be known far & wide for that amazing enchilada sauce. Yum...."}
{"text":"We always have good experiences here. This is a small comfortable off the grid establishment for sure. The service has always been good so has the food. They're always busy when we go for lunch or dinner. It's a great locals hangout. I recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"I've past this so many times and finally tried it.

The service is very nice. Atmosphere is like a cafe with some comfortable booths. The food was average. I had the beef fajitas and the meat didn't seem like the best cut. Salsa was OK but nothing outstanding. My husbands burrito was big, carnitas was seasoned well. Price wasn't too bad.

It's worth a stop for a quick lunch just to visit a place in business since 1975."}
{"text":"So, to remove any confusion.  This is NOT a part of the El Torito chain of Mexican restaurants found in most of Southern California.

This El Torito is a family creation that still sits on Boulder Hwy in Henderson on the way to Boulder City.  The area that it lives in used to be surrounded by unique businesses.  Such as Old Vegas, which was for the most part a Western Theme Park, the Nevada History Museum, and a Motel...I can't remember it's name but is resembled the Bate's Motel from Psycho.  

Now most of those places are gone but El Torito still stands and is still family owned and operated.  Some of the menu has changed and they've added some American fare, but the old recipes still exist and are worth a try.  My favorite is still their Albondigas soup....which is a meatball soup with onions and other such vegetables in the broth, yum.

If you're passin' through Hendertucky on the way to Lake Mead, make sure you stop by and get a plate Taco's....it'll make your tummy smile."}
{"text":"Great food and so friendly!  Try the spicy crispy fried green beans as an appetizer...you won't be disappointed!"}

1. Fries and fried chicken wings, 8

- Sort of next to WildFire Casino. In a desolate area by itself. Authentic feel. haha. 
- Free chips and salsa. warm, fresh and crispy chips. Generous servings.
- All food served blazing hot. Seriously, be careful not to touch the plate. 
- Fries and fried chicken were nothing special, taste like any other cheap HH restuarant. Ask for the sauce on the side rather than on the fried chicken. Just had a craving for Fried chicken wings. 
- Chimi was delicious! Deep fried, very crispy! Best tasting chimi I've had thus far. It came with guacamole and sour creme that made it extra flavorful. High recommendation. 
- Enchilada was amazing. The presentation was something I haven't seen before. It had a Fried egg on top. They made it over-medium, which is good, bc even at breakfast restaurants, they have difficulty or just lazy to make an over-medium. 
- Generous servings of meat! 
- Carnitas seemed juicier than the shredded beef
- I always go to a mexican restaurant and ask for all rice, no bean. Maybe it's the Asian in me. haha. Great tasting rice though. 
- Friendly service. 

Tues/Thurs they have AYCE Tacos for 9.99 1-4pm, soft or hard taco, any meat except fish. Sounds like a deal to me :)"}
{"text":"New Mexico Mexican food. The food is great and plentiful. Prices reasonable. Service was impeccable. Interior and Exterior could use some updating. Maybe a little landscaping. Or paving. Interior tastefully decorated. Roadside Mexican flare. Furniture a little dated and getting shabby. Huge inside. Definitely big enough for big parties.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My family and I came here years ago and it was the best Mexican retstraunt in town by a mile. 

Over the years the service has declined IMMENSLEY! Not just a service. The food is nothing what it used to be. Now it's just a dive Mexican restraunt using canned enchilada sauce and canned retried beans. Everything used to be homemade, definitely isn't anymore."}
{"text":"Finally I made it through the doors and I found you can NOT judge a book by its cover, which I have done for the past 8 years.  This place was awesome.  I planned a retirement luncheon for my friend with 7 of us and they did such a great job taking my reservation to having the table set up already and offering excellent customer service.  Oh, you want to know about the food? lol.  The chips were very fresh and salsa had a great flavor.  6 of us had the taco salad  which was very good.  Only complaint is it didn't include any beans - but we got passed that.  My friend ordered a burrito and she ate the whole thing.  I noticed they have a party room in the back and the place was decorated very nicely.  I will go back again."}
{"text":"Well now, where should I begin? Today is Friday, June 22, 2018. My family has been in Las Vegas on vacation since Tuesday. We've asked several people yo suggest great places to get some Mexican food because we had already been disappointed twice. So today after leaving the Hover Dam we googled this location and went there with our grandkids for s late lunch. We thought the other 2 restaurants were bad but this one is the worst ever! EVER, ever, ever!!!!!

The waitresses were nice  but the food isn't fit for my dog. The chicken was tough and dry. The chicken wings weren't wings but were winggets. They were fried so hard we couldn't break the meat from the bone. 

My chicken chimichanga was so hard, I could not chew it, therefore it was returned to the kitchen. My 4 year old grandson told the head wsutress that the chicken was rotten. He even asked them to take away his open face cheese quesadilla because the cheese was something he could not chew it!

Many people, I guess they were the regular neighborhood folks ordered soup and appeared happy,
but over half of the customers that were there while we was, sent the food back; too cold, too dry, cheese should have been white not over cooked  hard yellow cheese. 
I understand this is s family resturant handed down 3 generations, but if it's gonna  survive they MUST a cook who knows people eat with their eyes 1st and their mouths 2nd. The cook should visit other Mexican restaurants to WATCH the customers ENJOY their food"}
{"text":"We've been coming to El Toronto's for years & it's like home cooking!  They have the BEST Chile rellanos ever!! It's our first stop when we get here from So Cal!! Try it, promise you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Been going here for years. The staff is always really friendly. Only issue I have is that the food takes a while to get out to the customers. Food most of the time taste good but sometimes can be over cooked. Really enjoy the homemade guacamole and bean dip. Great family restaurant but is almost always busy."}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance of this place put you off.  You'll know what I mean if it's your first trip.  The exterior (and for that matter, the interior) looks like a combination truck stop / diner.  However, just walk in the front door and prepare for very friendly service and very good Mexican food in a very clean environment.  Very casual, you'll probably seat yourself.  Start off with chips and very good, fresh salsa.  Margaritas are tasty.  We always start with the albondigas soup.  Crumble some tortillas in it and you're set!   I like the ground beef taco and chili relleno combo plate (comes with beans and rice).  The carnitas enchilada is also good.   Service will fall over themselves to help you.  Sometimes on a Friday night you might have to wait just a few minutes.  It's popular, but they seem to turn tables quickly.   Lots of return customers.  The young lady in the front will greet repeaters.  It's a fun place, and the food here actually has some FLAVOR, as opposed to something like Lindo Michoacan, which in my opinion is just almost flavorless!"}
{"text":"Although their food is normally great, the owner's customer service skills are pitiful! Of course I know they just expanded and are probably still feeling the growing pains but it is not the first time she's had the ability to irritate everyone at the table.  

Last night, we had a group of 11 and the food delivery was much slower than normal, this included getting pitchers of margaritas. Half of our table was ready to walk out. We then asked for separate checks and she made it very clear that wasn't going to happen.  When asked why by one of our group, her comment was that she is the owner and can do whatever she wants.  

Not sure if many of us will be back and that's too bad! We all live close by."}
{"text":"Ok. Normally I would give this a 4-5 stars. We had lunch there last Sunday and the children ordered the fried chicken fingers. To my surprise my son comes up to me and said that his chicken was not tasting good. After looking at the chicken I noticed that the chicken was still RAW. I had to monitor his stomach to make sure he wasn't going to get sick."}
{"text":"Really want to love this place. Going down hill over the last year or so. So sad... service has gotten generally poor... food quality is nowhere near where is used to be. Giant sad face"}
{"text":"I was  pleasantly surprised by this place. It definitely doesn't look like much from the road, so we only recently decided to check it out.  The staff was friendly and we were seated immediately (actually we were told to seat ourselves).  It is a pretty big menu with lots of choices.  I did think they were a bit overpriced though.  My Mom had a 2 item combo with chile relleno and a cheese enchilada.  I had the same, but with the addition of a carne asada taco and the soup.  Both combos were served with rice and beand and came out scorching hot. Although everything came out quickly, our server never really checked on us and we never got our bill.  We walked to the counter to pay and waited a few minutes for the cashier to take a to-go order and assist other customers."}
{"text":"4 Stars for an overall satisfying experience including the best Chile Relleno I've ever had. El Torito uses pasilla peppers, which are dark green, and havarti cheese. Damn good!  The green chile is very popular here, and we all enjoyed our margaritas. The tortilla chips were a little disappointing, but 19 of us had dinner together, and everyone enjoyed it. This family run restaurant has thrived for 39 years - it was packed when we were there. It's easy to see why El Torito attracts a loyal crowd of locals. I'll definietly go back."}
{"text":"my favorite Mexican food in town!!! i have been going here since i was a very young kid, they remember us, our order and treat us like family everytime we come in... Lucy, Gia and Carlos my favorites"}
{"text":"Bad management.  Warm beans and rice...sent back twice.  Manager explained that the cook just had them sitting in pan and they were just warm..... MANAGEMENT PROBLEM!  Ordered chicken fajitas and they brought beef.  Came back with shredded chicken on a NON-SIZZLEING plate.  Another waitress had to come to our table 3 times to verify our order.  This used to be good place but seems going down hill fast."}
{"text":"Today we stoped in for lunch.
Authentic, original, nostalgic type of Mexican restaurant. This is seriously the BEST Mexican food I've had since living here in Vegas.
This isn't fine dining. FYI
You seat yourself, old school tables and booth. The waiter was gracious, the food was hot, fresh and delicious! The chips and salsa kept coming. The chips are thin, light and crispy. The salsa was average. 
The restrooms were clean also.
I had the Chimichanga (bean and cheese) wet with beans and rice on the side. Yes, yes, YES! Seriously, I really enjoyed this meal!
Apparently this place has been here for decades. I'm glad to be a part of something great.
5 Stars I'm looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"We tried it for the first time today and we LOVED IT! My husband got a burrito and I got the enchiladas they were amazing!  Definitely recommend and we will be back!!! :) they even have a kids menu which is rare for some cafes!"}
{"text":"Always passed by when going to Boulder City, finally stopped by.  Loved the Mexican decor.  Ordered Chicken enchillada, sauce was little salty otherwise was cheesy and delicious.  Beef and cheese burrito with sauce on side, husband loved it.  Nice atmosphere.  Waitresses very nice."}
