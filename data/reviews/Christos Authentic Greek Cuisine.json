{"text":"Best Greek Food in Calgary, awesome little place. Classy, affordable, and the food was just amazing."}
{"text":"Its really on of the best greek salads I've had and I've had a lot of greek salad.   An abundance of salty feta.  All my wife would say is \"cheezy goodness\"  Sometime you get overripe tomatoes and cucumbers in greek salad.  Not here.  The vegetables were perfectly ripe.   Yummy tzatziki."}
{"text":"Loved it! We were expecting a Greek pizza pub style restaurant. Walked into a dimly lit, elegant restaurant with a small but well rounded menu. We had the supreme pizza, and shared a Cesar salad to start. Everything was delicious, and that plus a drink each came to about $60 after tip. Definitely feel the of price was worth the quality of the pizza, etc. Good service, and the pizza did take a bit longer than expected but you could tell it was made fresh."}
{"text":"Love the clean modern (but still very Greek feeling) theme of the place. The souvlaki was great and the potatoes really stood out. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This newly opened Greek restaurant has so much potential to be a great place.

The decor was quite elegant (don't be fooled by the outside appearance), you can tell a lot of work was done to the place. The food was delicious, even the starter soup (cream of potato) and the Greek salad tasted very authentic and fresh. I ordered the spinach and feta stuffed chicken breast, my date ordered ribs and both main entrees were well done. The only problem I had with the food was that it took about an hour for any of us (we were a party of 12 and the restaurant was barely occupied) to receive our entrees and some of our orders were missing - I'm not sure if that was the kitchen's fault or our incompetent waiter. 

I know this place is fairly new so I won't judge it too harshly but our service was absolute shit. Our waiter didn't know anything about the menu, constantly forgot everyone's order, and his overall attitude was that he just didn't care. When he brought our bill out he put everything on one, so I went up to him and asked him to separate it and he looked at me like I was asking him to jump off a bridge. When he finally did separate the bill, he messed it all up, didn't get one right and said \"I did my best I'm not sure if it's right but you guys can figure it out amongst yourselves\" and just walked away. Worst attitude EVER. Also the waitress/busgirl that helped him out was very rude and she took my plate and my dates plate away before we were even done our meal. It felt as if we were being rushed to leave. It was not a good experience. 

Like I said before this is a new restaurant, and it has potential to be great, the decor is nice, food is delicious but the service needs to improve significantly and the servers need to be trained on the menu and their customer service."}
