{"text":"Place is beautiful and very well decorated, like \"dry law times\" . However , service is very slow and it feels like the staff is making you a favour serving you . We waited at the bar for like 25 minutes before they offer our first drink . Drinks were good ."}
{"text":"A homey little bar, tucked away in the basement of the Marben restaurant. You walk in an right away, you're hit with that drinking in your friends basement kind of feel. It's casual, and friendly; only, your friend is a top notch bartender that has dozens of high end liquors, and the pride to make his own dried fruits and bitters.   Really great place to hit up for drinks after work with your friends. If you're looking to relax and unwind with a great cocktail, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto for the first time and I stumbled into this bar because of yelp and it was awesome. The only downside is on a weekend it will be hard to get inside as they fill up pretty quickly.   The drink selection is great and the food is good too. The lamb fat brioche buns are the best thing on the menu followed by the fried cauliflower.   The bartenders and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. The decor is classic and it has an intimate vibe. Great place for date night. I've been here 2 weeks and I've come here 4 times. It's my favorite bar in Toronto hands down"}
{"text":"An amazing speak easy. This was recommended to me by a waitress at le lab in Montreal.  What a recommendation! I like the \"entrance\" experience. You have to call a number to get let in. You're brought in to a plain hallway that looks more as a hallway used for deliveries. You then walk through another door and then you're magically brought back to a prohibition era bar.   Dimly lit with very interesting decor all over the place.   Servers are super friendly, talk to them and get to know them. They will be able to make really good drink recommendations and even recommend you things off the menu, customized to your liking.   I definitely recommend this place, a fun experience and great drinks!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential but it's not there yet.  They're known for their cocktails and many of them sound very interesting and intriguing to order, But execution is poor and I immediately regretted not getting beer/wine.  I'm used to paying $15 for one drink but after trying two different cocktails, I can confidently say it's not worth trying any more. The people and place is great which is why I gave three stars, but drinks are disappointing."}
{"text":"A very intimate and hidden speakeasy bar on Wellington Street, just east of Portland Street. As others have mentioned, it's easy to miss, but it's directly adjacent (above) to Bar Marben.  The Cloak Bar is super popular and gets quite packed during peak hours, so make a reservation on OpenTable or show up early. We showed up on a Saturday night without reservations and ended waiting 2 hours, hanging out at another bar, before getting in.    The bar is visually appealing with nice dim lighting, marble bar countertop and plentiful crystalware. The bar stool seating with the wooden tables, were a little more basic, but served its purpose.   The drink menu was extensive but intuitive and the service was friendly. I really enjoyed my pear, whiskey and egg white drink, although I forgot the name of it already (it was quite strong). Anyways, a super intimate bar that's good for a date night (as long as you don't mind moderate noise level)."}
{"text":"Toronto's latest take on the speakeasy takes you back to the prohibition '20s, without breaking the law.  Located below the Marben, you pass through a cloak to enter the basement level, and you are greeted with a speakeasy d√©cor, with classic drinks, a mirrored wall with leather booths, and a understated interior.  The drinks are mostly named in a British colonial style, with the notable exception of the Banksy, a mix of tequila, with a spicy chili finish.  Drinking out of a paper bag never looked so good.  Other drinks are also available with a whisky, gin, or bourbon base; take your pick and see what inspires you."}
{"text":"The cocktails are great - one of the best I've ever had. The place has a nice vibe but it's a bit too cramped for the amount of people at full capacity. It would be a great place to have more intimate conversations, but after a while the constant noise and having to talk louder just wears down on you."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for speakeasies so I had to check it out. Good thing my friend knew where she was going because I would have gotten so lost. There was a bouncer at the door who said it was really busy downstairs, but right as we were talking to him, two people came out so he brought us inside. The bar had a cool vibe and was somewhat busy around 9:30pm when we showed up. I haven't seen many bars where you could reserve tables but this is one of them. Good to know for next time. I got the Bengal Lancer, which is one of their most popular drinks. It was alright...tasted like a glorified mimosa. The music was way too loud to have a conversation. I felt like I was yelling at my friend who was sitting right beside me. She had been here before and said it had a much different (more chill) vibe. It's a cool place to visit once."}
{"text":"Omg this place is just so cute!   After a nice dinner 'the boo' and I wanted to go out for a cocktail (or two... or three...who counts these things anyways?) So, I used my handy Yelp app to scan area. After reading some reviews I stumbled upon this one. Intrigued by other's stating it had a speakeasy feel and high star count we ventured on!  When we got to the Cloak there was a locked blacked out door that said to call if you want entry, I thought \"ooo fancy\" and dialed the digits. A nice sounding man answered, asked how many wanted in (2) and said he'd be up to let us in... Well, about 3 -5 minutes went by and nothing so when a young women came out of the door, we walked in.   We waited some more, walked down a staircase and turned around the corner to long hall and finally, we found the entrance! We were permitted in and sat at the bar.   The place was decorated very 1920's and the atmosphere was awesome! It definitely felt like you transported in time and were now at a swanky twenties bar.  The service was amazing, I don't know the name of the bartender that was serving us but he was very personable and made excellent drinks. I of course had my fav, the French 75. (Try these ladies, you'll LOVE them - but they do have a kick so, consider yourself warned)   We didn't try any food but I must say this place is a winner in my books and I would love to go back!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem!!! A must visit, not for the \"party animal\". This is a low key 1920's lounge. Beautiful ambiance. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"First, a note on finding the place. It took a while to figure out how to get into this place.  Based on the yelp reviews and address, we assumed it was something super complicated involving the apartment building next door.  It's not.  It's a pretty straightforward entrance on the EAST side of Marben.   The atmosphere inside is really nice.  Relatively small, but cozy interior.  We ordered the earl gray old fashioned for 6 in a decanter, which was very good.  Though I'm biased because: a) I love old fashioned, and b) I had been craving old fashioned that evening.  Where this place really wins points is on service.  When we decided to experiment after the old fashioned, the first drink we ordered was the 500 lb gorilla.  The drink was very licorice-tasting, which I'm not a fan of.  One of the servers came by and was adamant that we not just suck it up, and had our drinks replaced with something different.  Bonus points for service on that, although I would say the service was still very good outside of that.   For food, we tried a few snack-y items, which were good, but definitely not the selling feature."}
{"text":"The other reviews do not lie: totally feels like a speakeasy. Low lighting and candles all around make this a chill place to be. There are high tables to stand by and U-shaped booths. Very cool.  The cocktails were excellent. They were each unique and the bartenders were very knowledgeable. I asked for a suggested cocktail, she named one and listed the ingredients. I told her I was allergic to one ingredient and she quickly had a substitute for it. Nice!  I love to come back. Just don't forget where to door is to get out!"}
{"text":"Have you ever had a moment where you want to impress someone? Appear in the know with this hidden little gem. Designed to feel like your rich uncle's basement or a speakeasy, you need to call a number to gain access - if you can find the entrance. Owned by the same people as the Marben (upstairs), the cocktails, service and decor are excellent. I had a girl crush on our bartender for sure! Great for a date, friends from out of town or even to sit at the bar solo."}
{"text":"The Cloak Bar is a prohibition inspired speakeasy with an exhaustive (and fairly expensive) cocktail menu.  The cozy atmosphere and subtle music is ideal for a special date night or a relaxing evening with friends. The snack menu is unimpressive and the food quality lacks a certain \"je ne sais quoi.\"  I highly recommend sticking to cocktails!  If you're looking for a classic cocktail such as a G&T, go somewhere else or be prepared to receive a judgmental glare from your Server."}
{"text":"Crazy cool bar with kick ass drinks. It's very hidden but once you're in, everyone is super nice. Very gatsby like."}
{"text":"A very mysterious spot hidden in the residency neighbourhood. Love the lighting, seats, drinks and the entire vibe in the bar. But, you gotta call a secrete number to get in!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm a martini or a vodka/soda girl... But I always get an inspired cocktail here. Sexy music, very st.barts or st.tropez minus the pretension. Lovely, lovely staff. Really, I can't gush enough praise for this place. I love it."}
{"text":"Love this place because it's hidden and the drinks are definitely on point as well as the service! Dim lighting and very cozzzey!!"}
{"text":"this is a great little speakeasy bar under Marben.   We decided to give it a shot on a Thursday night and approached the door.  The doorman first told us the bar was full and we couldn't get in... the three of us looked at each other and said 'ok, lets hit somewhere else' and then he said 'we have some seats at the bar if you are interested in that'...     It's a small little place but the decorations are nice... I liken it to a small version of Soho House...   Staff were fine - one of the bartenders was a little too over the top with the banging of his shakers and making a lot of noise shaking up his drinks.   I don't bartend but do you really need to slam the glass that hard or are you doing it for attention?    Washrooms are clean and nice.    Overall, a great place to take a date or have a quiet drink with friends.  I would go back and would recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place during my time in Toronto, and loved it! Staff was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. I asked the bartender to make me whatever he fancied, and was not disappointed. This is a place where you can safely experiment with new cocktails. Drinks are expensive, but not unreasonable. You get what you pay for! Just had drinks, no food, but would absolutely return! Thank you to the Cloak Bar for a great time and delicious libations."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to visit this beautiful bar and couldn't have been more impressed. The decor was nothing short of spectacular and the service was great. We came on a Sunday so took advantage of the $10 scotch - unfortunately they didn't have Lagavulin on the shelf as they were in the middle of a rotation, but each of the server's (Jason) recommendations was on point. The oysters from Beausoleils were also fantastic. Planning to visit again in the coming weeks!"}
{"text":"Great place to get cocktails in a very comfortable atmosphere. Extensive but not overwhelming list of potent creative cocktails. Service is excellent, staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Music is not too loud and no need to yell at each other to be heard. The only room for improvement is their food menu. It is a very short menu and since the drinks are very potent, having something to snack on would be fantastic (especially if you did not have dinner before). If you are vegetarian or have some other dietary restrictions, there are few to none options. But definitely a place I'd go back to and not a lot of similar places like this in Toronto.   P.S. Finding this place isn't super straightforward. Look for the \"Bar Open\" sign and there is a counter with a number that you have to call to have the door open. Also, you can book tables through OpenTable."}
{"text":"Probably the best drinks I've had in TO other than BarChef but for the price, this wins. Call the number, wait around, then get led down into the hidden gem. Nice and quiet spot perfect if you're looking to talk and not have to yell at your friends. They have a ton of different options and the small plates of food are really good!!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Solid service, and great drink menu but the ambience- my god what a speak easy vibe! Low ceilings, dim lighting, and perfect tunes (trip hop and swing had a baby?). A great recommendation from Davy at the cn tower bar!"}
{"text":"The Cloak had been my favorite bar for a good while, but the last time I went it was quite disappointing.  It's still the same hidden location, the inside still looks like a classy speakeasy, but since the previous bartender is gone, the whole feel of it seems to have changed. The music is a lot louder, and I just don't feel like the music options gave off the same kind of feel it had before, the drink menu is has less options and is not as well made either.  Tried to order a Monte Carlo, but I don't think they knew how to make it... The Old Fashioned was only ok...  Either way, had I written this review 3 months ago, it would have been a 6 star review, but now, maybe cause I'm still mourning the old Cloak Bar, I can only give it a 3."}
{"text":"Had a really good experience here. Delicious cocktails and cozy environment. Recommend getting the big goblet cocktails to share! 10/10 would come back"}
{"text":"A pleasant unfortunate experience.  I was very happy to get a reservation in tonight as I already had one for tomorrow night.    Being very much into the \"speakeasy\" scene and having gone to many around the globe I was very excited to experience this Toronto night spot.    When we entered the room did not disappoint and the staff was very friendly and attentive.  The cocktails were good but not great however the mixologists were up for some off menu challenges which was fun.    Unfortunately at approximately the two hour mark we were greeted with a very unpleasant surprise, OUR TIME WAS UP.   Despite the fact we had been continuing to order drinks the entire time and had not yet ordered food we had to leave despite having reservations because our \"time was up\".  This was stated at no time when reservations were made or on entry.   As a result our reservation for tomorrow has been canceled.    All I can say is if you are looking for premium cocktails and are willing to pay for it go elsewhere.  As soon as you get started it's time to go."}
{"text":"Don't look for any signage anywhere because there isn't any. If you feel lost, ask the friendly host once you enter the Marben and they will direct you to a set of stairs tucked to one side of the restaurant. Expect to walk into a relaxed cozy bar with people congregated around really well made drinks and hiphop blasting in the background. If you can, sit facing the bar to appreciate the passion and expertise of the bartender as he whips up one drink after another with a level of focus and enthusiasm that I don't even put into my day job.   If you don't know what to order, just ask the helpful waiters for a quick recommendation or an indepth education session on a particular liquor you haven't heard of before. I found a new love in bourbon after having the Churchill, it tasted like caramel, smoke and a really good dream."}
{"text":"This place could easily be five stars.   The bartender and staff were very nice. The drinks were pretty decent and on point.   Up until the point where they decide and that they need to kick you out to turn the table.   My friend and I were here for about 2 hrs ordering drinks pretty much constantly. We were just about to order food off of their dinner menu. Then the hostess comes by to get her final order. WTF?  We were just about to order dinner what do you mean we have to leave. She said we already reserved your table and you have to leave.  We had reservations for the next day. So we asked if that was going to be a problem tomorrow. She says we don't know until that day.  I would love to recommend this place for craft cocktails. Unless you're willing to get kicked out after spending a couple hundred dollars feel free to come here, otherwise I would certainly recommend going somewhere else. Even the Ritz hotel bar  which is where we are now."}
{"text":"Great cocktails & nice atmosphere. We really enjoyed their small bites . The flavors were different and flavorful ."}
{"text":"I enjoy the idea of the bar, tucked away, in a basement and secretive. However the execution  is disappointing. Our drinks were so delayed, seems like only one bartender was serving the whole bar. Our fries was cold so we had to return it. The waitress was really nice and kept on apologizing but we still waited for more than 40 mins for our next drink. The drinks were so so, we had better...There's a constant line up outside....The reason why you have to wait to get in it's not because it's so busy inside,but because they are so darn slow...also, the incense they are bribing was a bit too pungent, but they were kind enough to put it off when we mentioned it. Bottom line, they need to add more staff, up your cocktail/ food game."}
{"text":"Super cozy bar with a great selection of cocktails and music. I came here on my last night in Toronto with my sister and we both agreed it was a good spot to end our trip. The bartenders are super friendly and welcoming and the entire atmosphere is very warm and comforting."}
{"text":"For a bar, this is hands down easily a 5/5. The classic decor is what really make this place sparkle. You can always have nice music and cocktails, but establishing a nice ambient is hard, and this place makes everything work together like poetry. If you want to impress anyone, bring them here! However, seats are limited, so make sure you do some planning ahead of time. Because upon arrival, the place got packed in less than half an hour."}
{"text":"It's a cool speakeasy bar. I have to admit I wasn't able to find the door initially, but thanks to the reviews I managed to find the entrance. Just a bit confusing, especially if there's no one outside from their staff. But really liked the ambience. Great customer service. Bartenders were really friendly to talk to and they suggested really tasty cocktails. I wanted to get something sweeter so the bartender was nice enough to prep me something off the menu, which was just perfect!"}
{"text":"We visited the cloak bar during the week after I read about it on Yelp.   When we arrived, we didn't find the entrance, so we had to ask in the restaurant (which is supposed to be very good as well!!). The entrance is right around the hedge and you couldn't tell because the path is just a meter or so wide.   On the door, there is a sign where it says that you should send \"knock knock\" and the party size to a phone number. It didn't take a minute and the door was open. We were then lead down to the basement and once we set a foot in the bar, we were stunned!! Candles everywhere, great furniture and very nice interior design! It took us a minute to take a breath :)   The bartender was also new to the bar and so we talked to him for a while. He also recommended two drinks, which were both very nicely made (but unfortunately they will not make my top 10 of all time...). Yes, the drinks were pricy, but worth it due to the very nice location and the exciting experience :)  Can totally recommend to come by! See pictures to have a better idea of the atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Checking out hidden speakeasies in Toronto and The Cloak Bar was on the top of my list! Made a reservation for Thursday night. When we got there, we had to call the number on the black door to let us in (located right under Marben).  When walking into this underground bar, you are instantly taken back to the 1920s prohibition era of illegal speakeasies with the dim lights and warm decors. Our server Rachel was fantastic; checking up on us all night :) Bartenders were very skilled and we loved their recommendations!  Cocktails you must try: - The Bartender's Phone # - The Island of the Cross - Old Fashion made with Basil Hayden!  Food you must try: - Fried cauliflower (amazing!) - Steamed chicken bun  Someone recommended French 75 on Yelp... I actually didn't enjoy that one as much because it was on the sour lemony side. But overall, very happy with everything.  I'd love to go again if anyone is up for another night of bar hopping :)"}
{"text":"Used to love this place when the previous bar tender was there.   Went this passed weekend and felt so unwelcome by the male server.. drinks took 25 minutes and the second round a drink was forgotten and claimed to never had been ordered.   When we left.. we didn't leave much of a tip.. because it wasn't earned. And he made a comment \"I'm paying you guys to drink here tonight\"   Too bad. Was a great spot and used to recommend it."}
{"text":"I visited The Cloak Bar last night and I really enjoyed the experience.  Love these little hidden bars that sort of feel like a secret gem when you enter.    Nice atmosphere, comfortable booths for groups, dim lighting and music all set the mood.  Great cocktail selection and no they aren't cheap but for the quality and expertise I think they are worth the cost.  Our server was very helpful in offering selections and helping us choose cocktails that were perfect for our tastes.  I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing hidden gem! Tucked away beside Marben, the nondescript entrance and security code box makes this place ultra-cool already. With it's speakeasy vibe, and dimly- lit interior, it's the perfect place to enjoy great cocktails and long conversation.   It's not the biggest bar out here, but that's part of the charm. Old school plush bar seats, and high tables scatter the room. The cocktail program is extensive, and serve up punch bowls if you want to get cray. Definitely a two thumbs up, and will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Fully enjoyed my experience here. I found this place on Pinterest as I was creating my board for our TO trip. It's in the part of town where there's a large amount of bars and clubs that are loud and slightly obnoxious so coming here felt like a respite of some sort. Also, I know some people feel like Speakeasies are kinda dumb because we are long past the Prohibition days, but as I travel and attempt to either bring back or have large amounts of local booze with me I keep finding that many places have alcohol laws that still date back to Prohibition. Also, those people can suck it because there's still something cool about Speakeasies.   You probably should make a reservation because it;s a pretty small place, but if you don't make one they won't look at you as if you broke the law either. Anyway, this is a Speakeasy in the sense that I walked right by it. It's definitely not in plain view at all. We went on a Saturday night (earlier in the evening) and were able to get a hightop table. For our first round we ordered cocktails off the menu and for the second round we both opted for Dealer's Choice. I can tell you that my Dealer's Choice cocktail stole the show. I feel bad because I have no idea what was in it, other than Mezcal, but the bartender hooked it up. Also, the bartenders were cool in that they came over and talked to us for a bit. So many times you go to these great bars and the bartenders act like they invented Peanut Butter or something. These guys were chill and also pretty attentive.  They have snacks here also so you can munch on some delicious delicious Popcorn Cauliflower and keep the drinks flowing.  Definitely recommend this place unless you're obnoxious. Then you should stay away."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The ambience is so romantic and chill. Best bar I've ever been to in terms of atmosphere"}
{"text":"It was crowded so we decided to take a seat at the bar. The service is amazing and the atmosphere is right on par. I would highly suggest coming here to anyone who is looking for something a little different than your average bar."}
{"text":"Great vibe. Went here for a private party and it was fun! Food was more tapas style and tasty but don't  expect to get full off of their dishes. Will definitely host something at this venue in the future"}
{"text":"The cloak bar is a lovely, tucked away little gem in Toronto. They have nice cocktails and tapas. Would love to see a couple more vegetarian options but the ambience and location are great."}
{"text":"This place has a NYC speak easy vibe. Great cocktails, great vibes. Good snacks. Definitely a welcome addition to the cocktail bar scene. Hopefully doesn't become too crowded or clubby. Definitely check it out. You can make open table reservations. Entrance is completely unmarked."}
{"text":"I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it.  We got a few cocktails, they were strong but took ages to make cause only one bartender on a Friday night. Cool place, the crowd is super alternative though so kind of a turn off for me but I can see the appeal here."}
{"text":"I tried this place with some girlfriends and it was awesome! Loved the cool, dark, decor and the hidden aspect of the place. Be prepared for pricey drinks though!! Our waiter was friendly but pronounced espresso expresso! Hate when people do that haha"}
