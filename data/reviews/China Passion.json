{"text":"Great food, great staff,  great vibe. I never write a review but I just had to for this place.  We will be coming back to China Passion often."}
{"text":"Great service from the moment I walked up to the cashier.  I ordered my favorite (Mongolian beef) and something different (Chinese eggplant w/ fried tofu) and was pleasantly surprise at the portions I was brought for the price I paid. And everything was excellent.  Definitely a repeat for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Coming from Hawai'i to Las Vegas it's always nice to find a place where the food reminds me of back home - &' this place is definitely on point    Keep doing your thing China Passion!"}
{"text":"We live in the area and have been to the many Chinese restaurants nearby. We saw this was under new management so we gave it a try for lunch. The last restaurant here didn't have is coming back for more but China Passion will be our new go to for Chinese food. We were a little apprehensive upon entering and seeing the menu handwritten on poster board and taped to the wall. They did have colored laminated menus too as we discovered. The lunch specials range from $6.25  to $ $6.75 which includes egg flower soup for dine in. Very good soup. The entree, egg roll, fried rice and noodles come  with the meal as well as crispy noodles and duck sauce. We had Mongolian beef and orange chicken. Everything was delicious. Even the crispy noodles and duck sauce which I usually don't eat because they are greasy and tasteless were good. The inside decor and seating could be elevated but I want is good food at reasonable price in a clean restaurant. China Passion delivered on all accounts."}
{"text":"We ordered from here because it was close and very affordable. It was AMAZING!!! The delivery was wicked fast, prices are very reasonable, and the food is fantastic! We won't be ordering from anyplace else."}
{"text":"i got take out of the the wor wonton, veggie chow mein and crab rangoon. the food was great and the 2nd day leftovers tasted even better which almost  never happens esp. with chinese food. they must really be using  quality ingredients  here. my only \"meh\" is the sweet red sauce  that came as a dip, it tasted funny, like it was mixed with bad tap water. the other dipping  sauce was fine. i cant wait to go back and try the orange chicken,  its probably  mind blowing."}
{"text":"Ordered from GrubHub, and sure glad I did. Food was exceptional and very tasty. The time they gave for delivery was very accurate. Veggies were fresh and meat was tender and delish. They even added sesame cashews as a freeby, now I'm addicted to them. Great place, for sure I'm gonna order or go in to eat again. Thank you China Passion for a wonderful dinner."}
{"text":"Well, I finally took a leap of faith, and caved into the very impressive reviews on Yelp, of China Passion, by placing my first order. This is definitely an establishment I've been eyeing for quite some time now, as I am a Chinese food fanatic! So, after seeing an astounding 5 star rating, I decided now would be the time to see what all the hype is about...and, in regards to my overall impression, I was underwhelmed, to say the least.   So, I initially planned to order delivery through the Yelp app, however after seeing that the restaurant offers a free appetizer to those who phone in their orders, I opted to do just that. I placed the call around 2pm March 22, 2017. The woman who answered the phone was very pleasant and knowledgeable when I inquired about the free appetizer deal. I ordered- 4 egg rolls, crab Rangoon, shrimp fried rice, shrimp chow mein, and general tso chicken. I was told that the 4 egg rolls would be my free appetizer and thus the charge would be omitted from the balance (and thank goodness for that! I'll explain shortly). I was given my total ($33, approx.) and told that I should expect delivery between 45-55 min. Pretty average wait time, so I wasn't complaining.   3pm rolled around and still no delivery. No big deal. I just decided to give them a call to get a status update. I was told that my order had indeed left and to give the driver a few more minutes to arrive. At around 3:10 I heard the delivery guy run to my door. We exchanged greetings and he was very apologetic about having been late, which I'm not really one who makes a fuss if my order is not overwhelmingly past the promised time of delivery, so all was fine. I paid my bill, tipped him and the next thing I did was feel the cover of the food on top. It was definitely hot. Yes!!  So, my next task was to inspect each of the containers holding the items I ordered. First up were the crab Rangoon and the complimentary egg rolls (4). The crab Rangoon looked great, size was decent, but the egg rolls were not at all what I expected, appearance or texture wise. They were a lot smaller than I'm used to, and they looked soggy, but whatever. Anyways, before proceeding to open the rest of the containers, I had to try these Rangoon's and egg rolls. Crab Rangoon? A+! Oh, so very good! They were crispy where they needed to be, creamy and bursting with flavor. I wish I'd ordered two! Now, I was on to the egg rolls and here is where I started to worry about what the remainder of the food would look/taste like. The egg rolls? Um, no. I took one bite and was immediately disappointed. They tasted just as they looked...soggy, and the veggies inside were mushy. I even contemplated re-frying them to at least give that crispy texture known to egg rolls, but figured that would be ridiculous considering they likely had been previously prepared in oil, so the extra fat/calories would've been too much. Besides, by continuing the cooking process, I would essentially be making the veggies inside even more mushy. Overall, I just felt that the frozen egg rolls I typically purchase are more satisfying, and that's why I made the reference above about being thankful for not having to pay for them. So, I move on to the other items. The shrimp chow mein looked decent, as did the shrimp fried rice and the general tso chicken. Portion sizes of the three I thought was sufficient for the price. As far as taste goes, I felt the chow mein was okay, but lacked the depth of flavor I'm familiar with and there were hardly any shrimp present (I had a hard time trying to shuffle through the dish to find shrimp, which were rather tiny, BTW).  I encountered the same issue with there being a \"lack of shrimp\" in the shrimp fried rice. There just wasn't much there. In fact, I wouldn't have known it was shrimp fried by first glance, so again I had to pry my way through to find the few shrimp that were included. Also, when I opened it's container all I could smell was fried egg. It was a little off-putting. The taste was okay though. And lastly, the general tso chicken. The taste was strange to me. At first I thought it tasted too salty. I continued to sample it, to try and discern what was off about it. I couldn't put my finger on it, though. I know that it definitely lacked that traditional sweet/spicy, ( I requested medium spice) robust flavor that's generally present in general tso.   With all that said, I felt that overall the food was certainly fresh. Would I return? I probably would not, but I do recommend others check this place out for themselves because my, or anyone else's for that matter, personal tastes, expectations, etc may be entirely different than what someone else prefers and should not be used as a determent to trying any establishment."}
{"text":"We live in Las Vegas one of the greatest place for food, this is a place that cares for the customers taste buds.  I have eaten here via take out I am amazed as to the good service, taste of the food.  A must try imo."}
{"text":"My name is Patty and myself and two friends went to China Passion last Sunday.  I had received some coupons in the mail,  so we thought, \"Why Not:\"    Well,  did we all get a surprise/.   The service was out of this world,  we couldn't have had better attention.  And the food,  forget it.   My friends order the Family of 2  for $27.   Holy Cow,  the food just kept on coming,  and I ordered Shrimp in Lobster Sauce.   Now, I have eaten Shrimp in Lobster Sauce for the past 30 years and in a lunch order,  I typically get 7 - 10 shrimp and in a Dinner order, I get around 15,  well,  I quit counting after 20, it was excellent to superb.  My friends had orange chicken, and shrimp with snow peas, plus with the coupons,  we got an extra appetizer, I got an egg roll, and the food kept coming.   What a great experience!!!!  You'd be cheating yourself if you didn't experience China Passion.  The place is 5 Stars for cleanliness,  10 Stars for food and 15 stars for service with a smile."}
{"text":"This place is so good. The food is great! It's very inexpensive and the service is top notch. They always go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect. The last three times we have been they have given us free stuff with our order."}
{"text":"Service was on time. Food packaged tight & securely. Napkins forks, with enough soy sauce & 4 fortune cookies. Loved everything. Cashew chicken - veggies were firm,  sauce very flavorful, chicken sliced thin & enough cashews. Lemon chicken over shredded lettuce was lightly breaded and crunchy on outside tender inside w/ plenty lemon dipping sauce. Appetizer Tempura shrimp was perfect! Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has good reviews.  It was horrible!   Chow mein mushy and cold.  Chunks of cornstarch in It.  Lemon chicken was hard as a rock.  Couldn't even cut It with a butter knife.   I will not be back."}
{"text":"Ordered party trays for my daughter's birthday and everything was a hit. Food was very fresh and delicious. I really like their food compared to any other chinese restaurants. Outstanding staff. Prices are great.  So if you are looking for service, quality, quantity and price,  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Seriously might be the best chinese food I've ever had, and I'm from New York!  The portion sizes were HUGE! We actually laughed when he brought the food out, it was so much.  Our server, the same young men a lot of other reviewers are speaking so well of, was amazing and attentive.  The Wor Wonton soup was the best wonton soup ever, though I think they should consider adding green onion to it. ;) The sweet and sour chicken was the best I've ever had, and is literally perfect. The noodles were so so yummy as well. The hunan beef was not what I expected, but only because I didn't read the menu well and had never gotten it before. It's very crunchy and tasty, but if you're looking for a chewy/tender texture I don't recommend it.  We will seriously be coming back every single time we're in vegas!  Again, the picture is what we had left AFTER we ate until we were full!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews prior to going to China Passion. I was not disappointed at all. The food was very good and hot. I ordered the individual 1/2 service and they're was enough food for 2 people. Needless to say I'll be having Chinese food tomorrow. There was a lot of food in the main course, egg roll, and fried wonton, and wonton soup that had 5 wontons. It was all delicious. This will be my go to Chinese restaurant from now on. Best of all it's only 3 minutes from my house. Forget Panda Express. My new passion is China Passion. The only caveat was there was a table that needed to be cleaned. When the plates are cleared, the table should be cleaned. This is what kept me from giving the testament a 5 star rating"}
{"text":"For reference, I am half Chinese and my dad owned a Chinese restaurant in Portland, OR my entire childhood. The staff here at Passion China was very friendly, our order was completed quickly, and the good was great! They even separated my Hong Kong noodles from the sauce for our take out, which I appreciated. The portions were generous, too. We ordered Orange Chicken, General Tso's Chicken, Hong Kong Noodles, Beef Chow Fun, Sautéed Veggies, and veggie Egg Rolls. My only critique is that the General Tso's could have a bit mire sauce on it, and it wasn't very spicy. Otherwise, everything was great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Great service.  I had the New York Chow Mein it was so good and tender. The portions were huge. My husband had Shrimp with Lobster   sauce. Huge shrimp in the serving. We took home a lot of food!  We will be back."}
{"text":"The delivery was very fast but the food quality was very poor. Way too much sauce on the dishes and the fried rice was bland. None of the food I ordered was above average. I have had Chinese takeout from several places in he area and this place was particularly low on the list."}
{"text":"We are happy to have found great Chinese food in our neighborhood. Everything we have tried has been fantastic and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"This food was so delicious even my one year old cleared her plate my favorite Chinese food place now it was so flavorful and fresh and the food was to die for my kids loved it I loved it hands down best Chinese food I ever had"}
{"text":"Always fresh, good food, and fast delivery! They haven't disappointment me yet, i order from there all the time.."}
{"text":"Not the greatest so the 4.5 stars is a bit misleading. The portions are huge but lacking in flavor :/"}
{"text":"The food is okay, a bit dry if you ask me. I could have gone to the mall and have been fine. The portions are large so be prepared to eat."}
{"text":"Last night was our first time thing China Passion. They have just become our regular. Even better the next day! The food was tasty and hot when it arrived. So many choices can't wait to try something else."}
{"text":"Fast, clean, fantastic service. Huge portions. This is our number one Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"This is no Jersey Chinese food, but it's pretty darn good. The portions are rather large, so in this case, sharing is caring. The chicken and broccoli is delish, and the garlic chicken is pretty good too. Crab Rangoon are SO good, sesame chicken is tasty, sweet and sour chicken is good, but their wonton soup not so good. Some may love it, but it's just not the wonton soup I am used to. I'm used to a darker yellow broth, and thick noodled wonton. Their soup is filled with a bunch of different veggies, very light broth, and the thinnest wontons I've ever laid eyes on. You get a great amount of food for a great price, and the staff is always very friendly when I've gone in."}
{"text":"First time here. Restaurant was empty at the moment.  The young man at the front was very nice. Food was decent but I think he forgot to pack my teriyaki sauce. I would try again in the future."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat!!! Food was not only hot n fresh but also had the best service! I only ordered a few things and got full fairly quickly. I'm very picky when it comes to Chinese food but this is going to a place I'm to very often. Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Quality and customer service. It's the Chinese food place you wish was just around the corner from your home!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, not sure what the young girl name is but she is so sweet. Food is bomb to. Come here like twice a month!!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food delivery in town...hands down. I've literally tried them all. Fast delivery, hot and fresh. I'm from California where good Chinese is easy to find, in Vegas it's harder to find and this is the spot."}
{"text":"This was a to go order so I think the quality could suffer because of that, like things wont be super crunchy for example thats fine. But I unfortunately didn't enjoy my food. It wasn't awful, but it was bland. I got two personal dinners of shrimp, the sweet and sour."}
{"text":"Family member suggested we come here. The rice was fresh, the food was excellent the portions were excellent, the service was excellent. They substitute some items we were unfamiliar with for those we were. If I had a gripe it would be it's not a place you sit down and eat. There's a TV but it wasn't on for those who wait. There's music but it's Chinese. It's almost like they don't want you to stay and eat. Since that was our intention there's no harm."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. My husband and I ordered takeaway on Saturday. Husband ordered me the spicy eggplant with tofu while I waited in the car. I saw someone run out the front door and then come back a few minutes later. Husband came back with the food and told me that they had run out of eggplant and actually RAN to Walmart to check if they had eggplant before apologizing for not having any. Talk about amazing customer service and kindness! I was blown away. Ended up getting tofu and veggie stir fry but they sent us home with extra egg rolls and a whole extra meal! I just would like to thank you so much for such kindness and for such amazing food. We will definitely be back. Keep up the incredible work/service guys, you're going to do great!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out because of the 4.5 review. Ordered take out: crab rangoons; \"butterfly\" shrimp; BBQ pork Chow Fun; Hunan Beef; Sweet & Sour pork.  Crab rangoons tasted fishy  \"Butterfly\" shrimp were sticks not butterflies & they were greasy, more fried batter than shrimp Chow fun was dry and flavorless The Hunan beef was fatty but very crispy The sweet & sour pork sauce smelled and tasted terrible, something was definitely off. The pork was very crispy but the sauce was inedible.  Also ordered a side of steamed rice, it was old and tough.  The chili sauce also tasted off.  I instantly got a weird smell when I walked into the place and the entire order was disappointing. We all felt sick immediately and now our stomachs are paying the price. Everyone who ate it is feeling ill and we are all fighting for the toilet. Maybe if Yelpers left 5 star ratings on places because of the quality rather than dirt cheap prices this disgusting food wouldn't have received such a high rating. So disappointed in the place, and in Yelp for being full of people who only care about deals and quantity,  not quality. What a shame."}
{"text":"This is our first time to order for delivery. We ordered Mongolian Beef, Orange Chicken and Hot and Sour Seafood Soup. The delivery was prompt,  the food was delicious, the serving portions fed us three with leftovers for another meal and the bonus egg rolls were flavorful.  The staff are very helpful, patient and courteous. This is our new extension to our kitchen and we are already looking forward to dinner tomorrow night."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant on the East Side! We order from here at least once a month! The food is delicious and the portions are huge. We always get delivery and the food is delivered faster than the estimated delivery time. My fiancé loves their fried wontons and their combination rice is great too! This is definitely our go to when we don't feel like cooking!"}
{"text":"First Time checking it out ... think it's rather new here and I called kinda late and they made the meal fresh for the Kid..... stay Tuned !!"}
{"text":"The food was so delicious! Definitely ordering from them again! We had general TSOs chicken with noodles best noodles I've had in a long time. And fried wontons, also pork fried rice, orange chicken on point!"}
{"text":"So happy to finally have great Chinese food !!  The portions are huge and the food has amazing flavor. They have real BBQ pork fried rice. Not every Chinese restaurant has it.  Favorite was the combination fried rice and the New York style noodles. Everyone I have sent here absolutely loves the food.  This is a must try"}
{"text":"Generous portions. Decent flavors. Friendly service. Great noodles. Atmosphere barren"}
{"text":"Really impressed by this Chinese food place! The orange chicken and chicken with broccoli are the ones we ordered and they were good. We also got the crab rangoon and those were great too. The flavor was good and they give you free egg rolls with a certain amount purchased with is nice. Our new go to Chinese place!"}
{"text":"Excellent flavor great portions  and excellent services Great Price of your looking for good food this is the place to go"}
{"text":"Visiting LV for a sport convention and was browsing reviews of Chinese food and this place came up! I previewed the menu for prices and options and decided to check it out. When I arrived the staff was so friendly and welcoming. I ordered the moo shoo with shrimp, egg flower soup and eggplant with tofu! It also came with egg rolls and wontons. The portions were huge for under $30. We thoroughly enjoyed the meal and everything had so much flavor. I totally wish they had this Chinese gem in SoCal. I definitely will visit again when in town."}
{"text":"The food was delish I ordered combination fried rice and sweet and sour chicken and crab cheese and the cashier also put in two eggrolls,because first time coming."}
{"text":"Best food and service !! Boba here is super yummy as well ! I called at 9:56pm when they close at 9:30pm and they still took my order and was happy not rude or upset that I called after hours. They are the best !!"}
{"text":"Ordered for pickup again last night and still was not disappointed! We got a free 6-piece veggie egg roll this time, which by the way were delicious (even the morning after). I wasn't expecting much because it was only veggies but man, they are packed full of flavor! Our food was still piping hot and lasted the drive home. This is my go-to spot and I recommend to all my family/friends that ask for a good take/out spot, they have yet to disappoint!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant for Chinese  around here.. The best generals chicken, big servings."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!!! Very generous portions and the food was delicious!!! The service was excellent!!! I would definitely go back!!!!"}
{"text":"We haven't had Chinese this good in a long time. Everything was piping hot and delicious.  I had the snow pea shrimp and rice and hubby had the bbq ribs.  Egg rolls were delicious and the little cream cheese wonton goodies were amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Best chinese food in Las Vegas !! large portions and everything has very good flavor. I tried china passion for the first time 5 days ago and I had to have it again today. it's safe to say that I'm hooked !! I"}
{"text":"Wow excellent food great service affordable I've found a new Chinese place for me and my family I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I called in take out and the young lady was very nice on the phone. Then I came inside to pick up my order and the entire staff greeted me with hello and some cooks while cooking acknowledged me with just a nod. It was very nice! The young lady hooked me up with some free egg rolls too! When we got home we couldn't believe the portions they gave. They give a lot! Idk what some people are talking about the bland taste of the food. I thought it was good. Was it great, no, I tasted far way better back in the Bay Area. If you expect exceptional then you'll have to take yourself to a high end Chinese restaurant. This is just off of Craig Rd, I wouldn't expect high end. China Passion's food is pretty good and at least it isn't fast food processed food."}
{"text":"This place is the best Chinese food we have ever had! whether we lived in San Francisco or New York Los Angeles or Butte Montana  this place is a winner winner and the amount of food you get is insane. You can tell the cook has a passion for cooking and puts love into it every dish we ordered was absolutely great.  We are so happy to know they are in the neighborhood and will continue to order from here. Clean Healthy cooked to perfection. Great Chef and customer service"}
{"text":"Every single time I have been here, the service has been amazing! They are so polite and attentive. The food is great, the portions are huge, and the price is awesome!"}
{"text":"Ordered Mongolian Beef, King Pao Chicken, and Fried Wontons.  Ignoring the fact that I requested light veggies in the entrees and they came with more veggies than protein, the food itself just wasn't good.  The chicken tasted like freezer burn and the texture of the beef was closer to wet bread than actual meat.  Even the wontons were inedible - chewy and greasy with no flavor.  Usually even \"bad\" Chinese food is fairly edible, but my wife and I ended up throwing the entire order in the trash."}
{"text":"Typically, Chinese delivery in this part of town is mediocre at best. China Passion exceeded my expectations. So much so that I ordered twice within 10 days.   Both times I got delivery. The first time it was super fast and everything showed up piping hot. The second time it was a little slower and less hot -- hence only 4 stars.   However, the food is yummy. It's clear everything is made to order and the portions are very generous. Beef broccoli is abundant with beef, no skimping on the protein. Sweet and Sour is almost 100% meat with a little veg as garnish.   The soup and fried rice are delicious. The family meal is HUGE and could easily feed 4 hungry people.   While I was frustrated by the slow and less-than-hot delivery, I'll still order again. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite Chinese food place in Las Vegas. Not only is it within walking distance to where we live but the food is always good and I mean ALWAYS!! Every time we go in we are greeted and treated like family. They even know our orders. Prices are fair and the portions are good sized. We usually get the combination fried rice and it's enough to share or take home for leftovers. Definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I love this place for quick go to China fix. Their service is quick and friendly. I love their chicken fried rice, and their sweet-and-sour chicken. My only issue has been twice I've ordered sweet-and-sour chicken and there was something wrong. The first time I did not get any steamed rice with my meal, the second time I did not get any sweet-and-sour sauce. Unfortunately I did not notice this until I was already home so I did not go back and fix it. But otherwise excellent service."}
{"text":"My parents were so enthusiastic about showing me this place. I'm here on a short leave due to military life. My first thought was ok, this place seems pretty cool. I was wrong. This restaurant is pitiful. Sure the food is ok quality, but the service is atrocious. Like seriously? We ordered our food, we tried the egg corn soup, it was served cold. We returned it, they heated it up, then it gained an aftertaste. Before all this, I ordered a boba drink. 45 minutes later, it didn't come. I decided to cancel the order. The rest of the food was served sloppy, and the restaurant workers didn't care. There was no compensation, there was no apology. The worker told us to \"come later\" next time so that we would get \"better service.\" I mean what the fuck does that mean? I offer the apology of sorry not sorry, I won't be coming back. If I could give no stars, I would. I'm very disappointed in this restaurant. My parents were so embarrassed to bring me here."}
{"text":"WOW! This place rocks! Great service...attentive and friendly. Food portions are large and very flavorful. I ordered the Hong Kong Crispy Noodles and hubby had the Beef Teriyaki Plate. They were both delish, and the restaurant also gave us a complimentary side dish of 2 egg rolls.   Lots of booth-style seating and table seating available, and they also do take-out and delivery service. Prices are reasonable and affordable. We will definitely be back and make this our regular go-to Chinese restaurant. We have enough left-overs for another meal!!!  The young guy who served us was very attentive to our needs and he was friendly and caring. Really a nice place to eat! Highly recommend you try them out!"}
{"text":"OMG! This place is Awful! Tried this place because of the 4 .5 stars from Yelpers but It's not Good at all. Everything was Bland! It also took them a very long time to serve our food! What a waste of $25.00. Lost us as good Customers"}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly service! Not sure how new the spot it signs for the grand opening are still up. I have been trying to find good Chinese since i relocated last year and will definitely make the drive to come back here."}
{"text":"Visited China Passion for the 3rd time. The meal was exceptional. While having our dinner a homeless man came in and sincerely asked for a meal. He said he was hungry and had not eaten in a while. The waiter told him to have a seat, then went to speak to the chef. A few moments later he came out with a meal for him. The homeless man was truly greatful.  This act of kindness is an example of the welcoming attitude shown by the owners of China Passion.  We as patrons of this establishment wish them luck and success."}
{"text":"Hate to be the voice of dissent, but I wasn't that impressed.  The portion seems like a lot if you like a meal that's 98% rice.  I was lucky to get 3 chunks of chicken in my Kung Pao and even one of those was gristle.  Also, if you like real fruit boba drinks, you won't find them here.  They are basically a slush with high fructose corn syrup.  The search continues."}
{"text":"Anytime I order from here the food is always hot and fresh. The quality is amazing and the service is quick. I have yet to actually go into the restaurant but when I order delivery I always have a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"WoW had Shrimp Egg Foo Young with steamed rice. It was delicious. Free egg rolls too. They were good. Our dinner took almost a half hour so our server gave us 4 free almond cookies. We are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"My 1st visit and the food was great! The food was served family style. Huge portions of everything! We ordered the \"Family Dinner A\": Sesame Chicken, Mongolian Beef, BBQ Pork fried rice and Hot n Sour soup. So many leftovers! The restaurant was clean and the staff was very nice and helpful. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken egg foo young!! Everything we've had here has been delicious and affordable. Good service too. Glad we found it!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times, the food was amazing! Huge portions and staff very friendly and helpful. I will continue to go there to get my orange chicken fix!"}
{"text":"We found our new favorite Chinese Food place- Amazing food served in Amazing sizes for an Amazing price! Excellent, attentive dine-in service."}
{"text":"Best. Service. Ever. We popped into China Passion today and I am sure glad we did. The service was above and beyond for sure. The food came out quickly and was very fresh, our drinks were never empty, and the waiter was extremely polite. The lunch specials are around $6-7 and the servings are huge!  Mom had the shrimp chop suey with half noodles and half rice and I had the beef with broccoli with rice. We also shared a serving of the bbq sliced pork which was delicious and a huge portion-we took the majority of that home to my husband. My food was good. The broccoli was super fresh and crispy. Mom said her food was great as well, and we definitely both took home enough for dinner. I took home the Mongolian beef for my husband as well as two free egg rolls that the sever brought for us. The restaurant was extremely clean as well, which is important. My first impression when I walked in was just noticing how clean it was. Highly recommend China Passion-we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this spot for chinese take out and we were very pleased.  Placed an order by telephone for order of hot garlic shrimp, general tso's chicken, and fried rice.  Order was ready to pick up with in 10-15 minutes.  Service was quick and friendly and food tasted awesome."}
{"text":"I discovered this wonderful neighborhood gem only a few weeks ago and as long as this place is around, I will NEVER order from Panda Express or any other Chinese food place again. I'm extremely picky about my Chinese food but this place is seriously the best place I have ever had, and I have definitely paid a visit more than a handful of times already. My son is a picky eater and even he requests it often. I highly recommend the sesame chicken, sliced bbq pork, chow mein and honey walnut shrimp...I could actually keep going lol. Visit this place and support a great local business so we can keep them around :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the Curry Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken. They give generous portions of the entree and rice. I hate it when places give a small box of rice for the entree. The food was tasty and the chicken was good quality meat."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and really like it. The portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable. I haven't had anything I don't like."}
{"text":"Flavorful food that was made-to-order. We had the Kung Pao Shrimp and Beef & Broccoli Lunch Specials. Each dish was under $7, came with chow mein AND fried rice as well as egg drop soup, crispy won ton strips and an egg roll. Definitely plentiful portions for the price.   The restaurant is very clean (including restrooms!) and the service was great, especially for a Chinese fast food place. The waitress and chef both came out to check how we liked the food and whether we needed anything.   We'll definitely stop by next time we're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! They took over about two months ago from Wok my world. They are doing a great job. Food portions are big, the food comes out fresh and hot. Very tasty. I had pad thai, spicy, it was so good!! The staff is very kind too!! We enjoyed our food and time here!!! Go try this place... Now!!"}
{"text":"This place has to be the best Chinese take I have had in las Vegas ..you have to try it if you are on the eastside"}
{"text":"\"He\" the name of the young lady at the register was the friendliest host of all the Chinese restaurant I have been to. It's been 5 months since they've open, but they're still treating their customers with some free egg rolls ,crab wonton and cookies!!  What a good gesture to earn their customers loyalty. The food is excellent and good servings. It has the authentic taste of Chinese food. Yummy food plus good customer service?? Oh yeah... definitely coming back!! ... ohhh, I forgot to mention..\"He\" offered me Thai Tea Boba for Free!!! She made the drink by mistake and asked me if I want one for sample. It was soooo good!!!! And for sure...I will order one next time.."}
{"text":"The egg foo young is excellent. They give good portion sizes and the service here is good. If your used to back east Chinese food, this is your place. Not fancy but cost friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious and super fast! Would definitely recommend. Had potstickers, crab rangoons, egg flower soup with corn and wonton soup. Nice portions and very tasty hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Great service, big portions, delicious food! Hooked it up with a free egg roll and free crispy noodles since I was a 1st time customer! Chicken and Broccoli was perfect! Will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"Omgeee!! This is probably the only chinese restaurant i know that makes me and my husband's tummy happy. It has huge portions, and fills you up halfway. Last time I ordered pickup and i did not get my soup or chow mien. But they have read my review, apologized and made up for the misunderstanding. I definitely recommended them to my friends and family nearby. The food is greater than u would think. Made this place my permanent chinese takeout spot."}
{"text":"We really like this little Chinese place. Better for take out but we sat inside and it was pleasant. Great service and good food!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! After a crazy, busy day we decided not to cook and seeing this new place, we ordered for delivery. The order taker apologized that they were busy and it would take about 50-55 minutes. Exactly 50 minutes after hanging up, the doorbell rang! The Buddha's Delight (veggies in a light garlic sauce) was cooked just a bit more tender past crisp - perfect in my book and the sauce was flavorful without being overpowering. The Shrimp Chow Fun was excellent, the shrimp were, again, perfectly cooked. The Crab Egg Foo Young was simply the best I've ever had! I've never been a fan of the standard \"over-cooked-hockey-pucks-soaked-in-gravy\" but these were very different! Light and fluffy egg holding just enough filling and once again, perfectly cooked, with the gravy on the side. The Chow Mein ($2.50 to upgrade as a side from steamed rice) was good, too. It had a completely different flavor than the Chow Fun. Halfway through dinner, my fiance said \"Throw out every other Chinese menu we have, this is the only place I want to order from!\"   The portions are big, (we are light eaters) but we had left-over Egg Foo Young for breakfast and the extra Chow Fun noodles for a light lunch. The rest of the Buddha's delight will wind up as a dinner side. If you live on the East Side or find yourself in need of a meal while over this way, they are well worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Super fast. Tasty food. Big portions. This is the second time I have ordered from here with the eat 24 app. Both deliveries were fast, hot and complete. Shrimp, potstickers and egg rolls are amazing! Yum!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have visited this cozy  and very clean restaurant twice. Very pleased with how delicious and fresh the food is. The service is done with great hospitality! This is our new go-to place for generous amounts of food at affordable prices. And it doesn't weigh you down either. Very well prepared food, and always plenty leftover to take home! My husband and I often joke that when we become regulars at a restaurant, it's likely business increases for the establishment. We look forward to seeing this restaurant outgrow their location and needing a larger space in no time!"}
{"text":"great place for your Chinese food fix. awesome service by a 16 year old boy named Jiahui . he waited on a full house and was also the clerk. our drinks were filled and he smiled while he talked. many servers can learn from Jiahui"}
{"text":"I just finished having lunch here with one of my friends. I have discovered my new favorite place. The portions were huge. The food was fresh and delicious. The service was excellent. We will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"The young man that served us was very courteous and so nice. The food was so amazing as well. Everything we got was very tasty. The serving sizes are ridiculously huge. The lunch special is around $6.25 and I couldn't finish. I could probably get two more meals from my leftovers. So happy I found this place. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"7/13/2017  The best thing going for this place is its food.  I've eaten here 3 times and tried different dishes and I have to say that China Passion has some of the tastiest Chinese food I've eaten in Las Vegas.  Not only is the food good, but the portions are twice as much as you would get at any of the chain Chinese restaurants, and at a reasonable price.  The place could use some atmosphere and decoration and I'll hope that comes eventually.  China Passon seems to do a great delivery business and I've heard them tell customers that they have several orders ahead of them and it may be awhile and the phone continues to ring.  I have requested my food with special sauces, my rice a certain way, and they have always met my demands.  If you are looking for good quality food, with large quantities at a reasonable price, and not expect much in decor or atmosphere, I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"We have a big family lunch and they gave us 2 free snacks!  On top of that, their food and service were really good. Ordered Egg Drop Soup, General Tsao's Chicken, Combination Fried Rice, Combination Omelette, Pork Pepper and Onion. ALL is delicious. Surely will come again next time we visit Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I was expecting for the orange chicken to be sausy, but it was rather dry. It tastes like water from the sink, I was disappointed. Panda Express orange chicken is way better. The chow-main/fried rice was flavorful and their customer service is 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Customers beware!!  Owner of business will try to make you give him 5 stars. Soon after posting my first review I got a call, a message through yelp, and text messages on my personal phone. So inappropriate and unprofessional. Owner kept bugging and offered a credit, and as soon as I mentioned to credit my cc he stopped responding. Will definitely not be ordering from here again.     Not impressed. Maybe I could've had a better experience eating in. I ordered for delivery and order was wrong, there were some missing items, food was mediocre and egg rolls were cold and soggy. Delivery took almost an hour so that could be why. Disappointed, was actually looking forward to a good Sunday dinner and instead I'll be throwing all of it away."}
{"text":"Love the food, prices are great (even if you don't get a lunch/dinner special) & I appreciate how close they are to my house. Makes for quick & easy take out & they always deliver on time, if not well before expected. My boyfriend loves the pork fried rice & I'm obsessed with the chicken chow fun noodles!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! I was greeting as soon as I walked through the door. A younger gentleman took my order and even helped me find what I was looking for after describing the dish to him. After he told me the total he said he would throw in free wantons! The food was really good and a lot of it! I've found my new go-to Chinese place!!"}
{"text":"This is the best chinese food you can order around here.  The food had us raving for days to our friends and they added free egg rolls to welcome us to the city.  I enjoyed the chat with the employees as well.  Very friendly and willing to make solid recommendations while you make up your mind."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this wonderful place many times. It is great! Friendly service, wonderful food and its out fast! Very generous portions as well! You absolutely must try this place!!!"}
{"text":"The sesame beef was so good! most of the rest of what I had from won ton to the chow mein was basically OK so I cant wait to come back to try another entree. The give good portions for their more than fair prices, hopefully I can find another main as good as the sesame beef."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Got the classic Christmas Eve dinner from here. Not only were they open in the evening when everything else was closed, they were excited for the business and had our meal ready within ten minutes.   Girl who took our order was also super helpful and nice, gave us several delicious freebies to boot!   We went with chicken fried rice as a staple and it was very solid and strong flavor as a main fried rice dish.  Also got General Tso's and Beef and Broccoli, both very solid.  Finally, the chicken fried wontons are outstanding.   Thanks and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've eaten here and it's pretty darn good!! I am very particular with my noodles and fried rice but they definitely more then passed the grade! The chow fun was tasty well cooked not salty. The chow mein wasn't over cooked very well seasoned.  The fried rice was good especially since the rice wasn't mushy.  My only comment this the 4 stars is the teriyaki sauce tasted like from a bottle and super sweet and the orange chicken needed a bit more flavor.  The prices are average for places similar and the portions fair. The dining experience was worth it. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large order after recently moving back to the Vegas valley. The food was well cooked and hot when it arrived well within the expected time, less than an hour. There was a small mistake with one item, but the restaurant was immediately apologetic as well as bringing us the missed item, they brought some cold sodas.   They were very busy, and the error wasn't a huge deal, but how quickly they fixed it settled them into being our new fav place for Chinese-American food. It is very appreciated to have a business care that much that their customers are happy.   We stuck to the fairly typical foods, so I'm not going to list them all. The flavours were well developed and balanced without anything being too sweet or salty. Everyone, and that in itself is extraordinary as we have some picky eaters, was pleased and had only good things to say about their food.   Servings were large and will likely feed us for several days.  So, in short, China Passion has tasty food, *Excellent* customer service and their prices are reasonable for a variety of budgets."}
{"text":"I began using this establishment via Grubhub about two months ago, just to take a leap of faith. I am glad I did! The food is always well prepared, well packaged and delivered VERY quickly! They always arrive 20-30 minutes earlier than the quoted delivery time."}
{"text":"The salt and pepper wings might be the best I've ever had. 5 stars, and they deliver!"}
{"text":"I found my new favorite place to eat. The food and customer service is outstanding. I will be back again soon. Huge portions so I can have plenty for a late night snack."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, great food, great prices and the family that runs it is super nice. Great spot for Chinese, you'll never see me at panda again! Definitely recommend. I'm a regular at this spot, two thumbs up"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food we have come across since when have been in Las Vegas. The serve huge portions for not a lot the portions can feed 2 or more people. Great food , and great staff."}
{"text":"No better Chinese restaurant in northwest Las Vegas.  Great menu selection and food is freshly prepared and delicious!   Good size portions & great prices too!  Had a difficult time finding a great Chinese food but not anymore.  We are definitely regulars."}
{"text":"I personally think it's hard to find good Chinese takeout in Las Vegas.  I've lived here for 5 yrs and tried so many places but this one has been the best by far.  The Honey Walnut Shrimp is great and the size of the shrimp were impressive.  Delivery was quick.  The food was still hot when it got here."}
{"text":"We ordered a variety of items for pick up.  The orange chicken, sautéed veggies, fried rice, Thai noodles, wonton soup, and egg rolls.  Our order was ready at the exact time they told us, if not 5 minutes early.  And it was delicious, hot and tasty.  I'm very picky with my Chinese food and this restaurant has passed the test.  I even ate my leftovers the next day (which I rarely do.). I will definitely be ordering again.  The store was a little hard to find, tucked in a strip center in front of the Walmart neighborhood market.  But, parking was super easy!"}
{"text":"Mmmm so good! Great Chinese food! So much food and sides. Went in for lunch and got a five course meal! A bunch of food for a great price! Staff was courteous, friendly, and helpful. They have boba too! Only wish it was a sit down restaurant and not an order and sit or to-go place."}
{"text":"Newly reopened Chinese carry out.  Food is prepared fresh and hot.  Portions are generous.  Sauces are light not full of cornstarch.  A few tables inside but a brisk carryout business. Many Asian food establishments in area but this is so far the best."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp and their food was very tasty!  I ordered over the phone and I talked to the gentleman, it was a little hard to understand each other but that's okay he got my order and everything was correct when I got home.   Ordered the 'family dinner A' $25.95 really great price for all that food! After tax I think it was about $28. Definitely worth it because even after 3 adults ate there is still some leftover for me to take to lunch tomorrow! Lol  Crispy wonton chips 5/5 stars(one of my favorite snacks..lol with the sweet and sour sauce)  2 crab ragoons 4/5 stars   2 egg rolls 3/5 stars just okay nothing amazing   Large egg drop soup 3/5 stars  2 entries  Sesame  chicken 4/5 stars crispy and flavorful Beef and broccoli 4/5 stars lots of meat and good ratio with broccoli   And pork fried rice 4/5 stars rice was fluffy tasted great and lots of bbq pork."}
{"text":"Super friendly and good food. Service was amazing. They are very hard working. The lady who worked here was very friendly. She bagged our food for us and always made sure we had everything. I recommend this place for when you're craving Chinese or Thai food. The price is fairly reasonable since the portions are giant."}
{"text":"The food is alright, nothing I would go out of my way for. The rice had a propane taste. The orange chicken had bones when you bit into some pieces. The guy at the front couldn't speak much english, but I give credit for trying. He couldn't understand when I was asking questions about getting extra sweet and sour sauce. Overall, I would rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Warning: Not for the faint-hearted!  Let me start with the servers. They are really nice. It's a family restaurant and they really take care of diners. The first couple visits we had were great. They would sometimes offer free appetizers. Their serving sizes were huge. Prices were reasonable.   On our last visit, we ordered some chicken curry. It was not as great as the other curries we've had but it was fine. It had a weird jelly looking texture. They also forgot to give us our rice with the curry. We tried to ask for the rice but it got busy so we had to wait (for awhile) until we actually got it.   The next day, my boyfriend and I had diarrhea. It was horrible.  Our first two visits were exceptional, it really set the bar high for them. That's why I was so disappointed with the last one. Plus, the symptoms came at a really bad time for me, I was at work... I had to rush home because it was a pretty bad one and I do not want to stink up the restrooms for everybody."}
{"text":"Great service! Never disappointed!!! I always delivery with them! Always nice and happy! If I move out the area I will drive allll the way to them just to eat here!!"}
{"text":"Got some take out tonight. Nice location by Wal Mart. Very kind and courteous service. Good food with big portions. Had Lemon Chicken and Chow Fun noodles. Both were tasty. Would eat there again for sure."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had since moving here a few years ago. Not only was the food great but the service was even better. They included on the house appetizers and their lunch portions were huge. Rangoons were awesome, orange chicken was best we've had as well. Everything was quick and fresh prices are awesome too. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Picked this place based on the reviews last night for the first time and I'm so glad I did. THIS is my new Chinese spot !!!! All I can say is YUM! I live about 10 min from the place.. ordered delivery around 730pm and food was here around 820.   The egg rolls, wonton soup, general tso's chicken, honey chicken and pork fried rice were SO GOOD. Hot and fresh. And boba !!! I got the strawberry one and it was delicious!! Dine in or order for delivery from this place ! You will not be disappointed. Very very tasty!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place from my Facebook  Eastsider group. It has not disappointed!!!!  So good huge portions always gives you so.e freebies as well! So fresh, great customer service! New favorite place!"}
{"text":"First time here. Food was very good with large portions. Server was attentive to our needs offering refills, napkins, asking how we were doing. It's nice to have both good food AND good service."}
{"text":"My name is Daniel. S. The \"S\" could stand for \"savors Chinese food.\" Since I was a toddler I have savored the taste of delicious Chinese food. Years later as a middle aged man, my goal is to try every Las Vegas valley Chinese restaurant around the Chinatown (excluding 1 star and sanitary challenged ones). The neat thing about experimenting with new Chinese restaurants is that you hit gold and find a fabulous one. When I found China Passion, it seems that I struck gold.    China Passion is not in my neck of the woods. However, it is in Sam's Town and Boulder Station's neck of the woods in the Albertson's-anchored shopping center at the northwest corner of Nellis Boulevard and Vegas Valley Drive.    With the intention of visiting Sam's Town, the highly rated China Passion Yelp reviews convinced me to give the restaurant a try. I am of the opinion that if they keep up the high Yelp ratings that  they will be worthy of the \"People Love Us on Yelp\" window sticker.    I arrived a couple of minutes before the 11:00 a.m., opening. At the time I was the only one in this medium sized full service restaurant that also offers take out service. Right off the bat, the friendly man welcomed me to the restaurant before performing the role of waiter.    Thanks to a Yelper's pictures of the menu, I was aware of the lunch special. One more time I will shout out loud that a lunch special in a good Chinese restaurant is one of the best deals. For $6.25, I ordered the pepper steak with onions combo. It included fried rice, soft chow mein noodles, spring roll, a bowl of egg flower soup, crunchy noodles with duck sauce, and a fortune cookie. For an additional $1.50, I ordered bottomless Coke. From the vantage point of my booth, I could see the kitchen where they cooked my Chinese food.    The crunchy noodles with duck sauce were crunchy. Usually, the quality of the noodles give me a sneak peak to what the quality of the food that follows is. The tasty noodles gave me the right impression because the bowl of egg flower soup that followed was superb. I can only imagine how they make my favorite soup in the world: wonton soup.    The main event was likewise superb. To main event was so large that I was thinking that the waiter might of served me the dinner portion. The large portion equated to quality equals quantity. I couldn't finish it all, regardless of how tasty it was. I enjoyed the rice. The soft chow mein noodles were superior to some of the Chinese restaurants that serve it as filler. The bean sprouts interspersed with the noodles created a nice flavor. To add superior flavor to the soft chow mein noodles I reached over to the Sriracha sauce then poured it over them. By the way, the waiter had asked me if I wanted all fried rice or half noodles and fried rice. The spring roll was allright. In all honesty, I am a fan of the egg roll in lieu of the spring roll. Ultimately, the beef pepper steak with onions was very good.     All this food that I described with a drink added up to $8.58 after taxes. With the generous tip added on, this full service meal in a Chinese restaurant came out to the same or even less than a fast food meal in Panda Express.     My only complaint is that on a heated July afternoon when it was in the triple digit temperature that the air conditioning should of been on and the overhead fans spinning. I was hot. The inside temperature was a contributing factor to passing over finishing the large plate of food.   Overall, China Passion is a winner. From the time I entered to the time the waiter said, \"Please visit again soon,\" at the end; I felt like I was welcomed here. If I lived in the area, I would visit again soon."}
{"text":"The location is very convenient, has ample parking. We got the family special which came with generous portions. The food was very good. Orange chicken,  broccoli beef, pork fried rice,  egg rolls, and crab rangoon $25.99 staff was very courteous and attentive with refills."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Planned to meet my son for lunch at Wok my world.  Did not know of the changes.  My son and I decided to try China Passion.  So happy we did!  Food was wonderful, large portions, fresh vegetables.  I had my must have, wor won ton soup. Fantastic! So tasty and full of shrimp, chicken, pork and wontons.  Wontons were made perfectly not mushy like some other spots.  The server was so gracious and recommended the chicken chop suey with white sauce even though it wasn't on lunch special.  My son had the beef with brocali and loved it. After enjoying our delicious lunch, we were able to each take food home!  Highly recommend you give China Passion a try.  We need to support our neighborhood businesses.  Especially the yummy ones!!!"}
{"text":"The first three times I ate here, it was great and it was new, only in business a short time. Well I took a friend after raving about how good it was and I was so disappointed. Soup flavorless, egg rolls mushy, just bad. Sorry China Passion this was a fail."}
{"text":"I'm normally very picky on Chinese food but this place is amazing! They have phenomenal service. The servers are friendly, warm, and ready to have a conversation with you. They really care about if you enjoy your food or not. The lady is super sweet, and they were out of string beans(I'm guessing that means they are amazing :) ) so they made up for it with free potstickers(because we were talking about ordering them, but didn't want to order too much food).   The food is delicious as well! I really enjoyed the cashew chicken, and you can taste the fresh vegetables. They also have humongous portions. I was starving before I came in, and we ordered the egg rolls, wontons, egg drop soup, cashew chicken in place of the string bean chicken, and the orange beef. Now, I thought this was going to be plates with sides of chow mein, and rice. I was wrong. The portions we got, we didn't even put a dent in(and we often go to Mexican places with HUGE portions if that tells you anything). This could literally feed a family of six easily and still have leftovers.   Also, the price is just right. All the food we got(we still have leftovers for dayyyssss) and it was under $40. It's definitely worth a stop in if you're feeling Chinese food.:)"}
{"text":"This place is way better than the Chinese place that it replaced, and they are the best Chinese food in this area.  I've eaten here a couple times now and haven't been disappointed. I love their Egg Foo Young, but they also make a very good Kung Pao, Mongolian Beef, and Shrimp in Lobster Sauce. Their menu is very large and has all the typical Chinese dishes you'd expect. Its your usual Americanized Chinese dishes, but they are all done very well. I wish they had a few more authentic dishes but hardly any body does outside of china town.  Their portion sizes are huge! When my wife and I order a family meal for two its usually enough for us to make four or five meals out of. They make very good chow mein and fried rice, and if you don't want a family meal you can up charge the white rice with any entrée for $3.  There's not much more to say except that this place does your typical Chinese dishes exceptionally well. If you love around here, I would check this place out."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Stopped off for lunch while driving back home on vacation and we stumbled across this little gem. The servers were incredibly kind, attentive, and helpful! Their portions are huge, and the food was incredibly flavorful. I look forward to eating my leftovers tomorrow but will be sad when they're out of my life."}
{"text":"Just grabbed dinner from here, and it was amazing!!!  Comparable to the Chinese restaurants in downtown Toronto!!  The salt and pepper porkchops and wings were perfect!  A small place, but the flavor was outstanding. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"In ordered lunch on a whim from China passion.  I ordered the sesame chicken and was surprised not only at the sheer volume of food, but the value.    The food was delicious. I'm a town that struggles with decent Chinese cuisine this is really a pearl in a bed of oysters.    I HIGHLY recommend this Chinese restraint and will definitely be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"WHY IS THIS PLACE NOT NEAR MY HOUSE. Okay, I spent $30 and got a shit ton of food. Like I'm gonna be eating leftovers for days and it's all really good! It's the perfect Chinese takeout that is yummy and quick and totally affordable. They even gave me free cookies with my order! I will definitely hit this place up for their grub if I'm in the area, which I hope I am now that I've had it!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!! Food is fresh hot and LARGE portions! They're very polite and fast. Even when you order for delivery they told me 45/55 mins they got here in 20!!! I highly recommend this place!!!!! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to China Passion everyone is super nice there and the food is large portions and I always have leftovers for the next day I definitely recommend this place. Also I have ordered delivery with China passion and they always are quick fast and the food is always hot great service."}
{"text":"Husband and I decided to try this place after seeing the reviews on yelp. We were not disappointed! Food was good prices were fair and service was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I finally found a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant worth talking about! This place is awesome! I've been here 5 times now with my girlfriend (who also loves it) and they've been very hospitable with they're service and consistent with they're food, you can't go wrong! My girlfriend and I recommend the lunch special, very fairly priced and portions are huge. Other then that all there entrées are family size good for party's 3 or bigger."}
{"text":"The most friendliest Chinese place we have ever been. We eat a lot of Chinese and I've never talked to a nicer young man. We ordered pick up. The Chinese kid Juihai, that answered the phone was polite, quick and made sure we knew where the location was, asked if we needed anything and then because we had a big order he gave us free potstickers. Never have we had great customer service like that from a Chinese restaurant, let alone most restaurants. Awesome awesome job! Keep that kid for your business, he is great."}
{"text":"Wanted to eat soup so we tried this place. We ordered Chinese eggplant and tofu and won ton soup to go. Very delicious! We will def try this place again. Customer service is friendly, everyone was smiling. It is also very clean place."}
{"text":"2-7-18~After reading reviews we decided to give this place a try. What a great little restaurant and some of the best Chinease food I've had. When your seated they give you chips and a hot honey sauce for dipping. Yum!I got the Mongolian beef and BBQ pork as an appetizer. The BBQ pork was incredible! The best I've had. The Mongolian beef was so good. The give you huge plates of food. Plenty of left overs. Dinner comes with egg roll and white rice. For small fee you can have fried rice. Very clean restaurant. Friendly staff. Prompt service. Waitress came back to check on us several times. Love this place! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Get takeout here many times with a boba milk tea. Cheap prices for the serving of food given and very nice staff as well. My go to place for last minute dinner."}
{"text":"Just came in for the first time. Absolutely delicious and the service is beyond excellent. Great price and amazing portions. Highly recommend the personal dinner option or ordering dishes to share family style."}
{"text":"I ordered at 7:00PM and the food arrived before 7:30PM. The driver was very courteous and cheerful. The food was hot, delicious, and exactly what we ordered.  The pricing is reasonable per main dish, but you should pay attention to what options are available to minimize overall cost, especially if you like fried rice or chow mien and don't care to have a lot of steamed rice left over. (I use the left over steamed rice to make my own fried rice, but that is another story.)  All told, we will use them again the next time we want Chinese and we either don't have the materials on hand or are feeling too lazy to make it ourselves."}
{"text":"Large portions and good tasting. Great price too and will be enough to feed large families. Too much for me to finish so a take out box gave me enough for another meal. A bit salty for my taste but still delicious. Wait person was super friendly and obliging. Respectful to everyone and really curtious."}
{"text":"Big portions on family dinner, food was good, service was quick and excellent, but the dinning room floors and front windows were dirty. Makes you wonder about the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"3rd time here and it's been a great meal each time. The orange chicken is the best I've ever had. Honey walnut shrimp is out of this world. Service is frindly and genuine. I'll continue to eat here."}
{"text":"What a wonderful dinner and more than enough to have for lunch tomorrow to.  I ordered General Tao chicken and it had just the right amount of heat."}
{"text":"Great food and a lot of it for a very reasonable price. Great service. I'm from out of town but I'll definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas. Quality value and service worth the visit"}
{"text":"Great budget Chinese food. Loved the chow mein, Mongolian beef, and Singapore noodles. Friendly staff. Large portions. Lunch specials were huge."}
{"text":"Passing by through the groomers and hungry. I got the kungpao combination with rice and noodles. Best noodles that I have ever tasted since moving here and the Kung pao was so so good. The young man working here did a great job and I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I've had out here. The portions are huge, and the prices are great! Very reasonable. The customer service is amazing. The young server is great. If you become a regular, which I suggest you do, they take care of you for sure. We've been there four times, and every time after the first time they've given us complimentary egg rolls. Overall GREAT food, and GREAT people."}
{"text":"I had been pretty happy with this place but tonights delivery was missing items and took OVER an hour to deliver. Food was not prepared as requested and overall disappointing to the company I ordered this food for. Will think twice about ordering again."}
{"text":"Really great food im not big on chineese food but this hit the spot real good there flavor here that screams amazing plus the service was excellent they treated me like i was a special invited guest kind of like family not to mention it wont cost you an arm and a leg to dine here im really happy i came here its a new spot and i recomend you eat here"}
{"text":"Found our Chinese food spot! They give you so much food for such a good price. The service there is great and super friendly and always checking up on you and see how you're doing. Orange chicken is the best! Will be back!"}
{"text":"We are always on the look out for a good Chinese restaurant...I yelped it and this was close to the house and had good ratings. The pictures that were posted also made us think we should give it a try. When we walked in we were pleasantly greeted and given menus. We decided to try their lunch special. My man had Mongolian beef and it came with fried rice and noodles. I tried the Kung poa chicken also with fried rice and noodles. They brought us out spring rolls and egg drop soup along with the won ton noodles 1st. The egg drop soup was great...it's one of my favorites. This one had corn kernels in it also which I have had before but my man hasn't.   I am so picky about meat and can never normally eat the Mongolian beef but I always tey it anyways...well this was a first...it was delicious. Perfectly tender and melted in my mouth. I don't think he liked that I could actually eat his dish! ;) the noodles and rice...perfect! My Kung poa chicken was good ...but wasn't very poa-ish...I like it a little hotter. But it was good! The staff was sooooo friendly and attentive.  The food portion given was HUGE...enough for 2 meals! We took an entire 2 boxes home. It didn't even look like we ate anything. Our bill was less than $20! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This time we came for the Lunch special combo. I had the pepper steak and wifey had Cashew Chicken. Plates so large we took some for lunch tomorrow at home. While there I was thinking. Before Vegas we lived in So California for 19 years never finding that one Chinese restaurant that was like home because in California everything is Hong Kong style. We are originally from Brooklyn and Long Island N Y where we had Cantonese among other styles. \"China Passion\" is the place we looked for over 19 years in Calif. Thank God we found you. I hear there is another location on Sahara on East side of strip so we have an adventure to look forward to."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!!! The guy waiter was so nice too. He kept making sure we were taken care of and to let him know if we needed anything. He answered our questions thoroughly as we needed. He was very joyful and polite.   I actually only came hear because I heard they had Honey walnut shrimp.  We both ordered Honey Walnut Shrimp and for $11 ea. You can easily count about 20+ pieces on our plate. And for this dish is good amount given that it contains a lot and is actually pretty big pieces. I was stuffed after this plate.   It was weird because at first I wanted to get the 2 vegetable rolls as appetizers but I didn't want to walk out rolling. So I didn't. But half way through our plates the waiter brought us the 2 vegetable rolls as complimentary. Probably because I called for them in mind. I think mostly because it was our first time here. Lol thank you for that!  The honey walnut contains quite a lot of honey, walnuts and at the bottom lettuce. Which at first it seems to not go but once you eat it tastes very good like it's good to add some veggies.   Overall the service was great, the food was tasty and I'm sure ill be back for more. 2 of those plates and 2 drinks was $30. Thank your for the service it is very hospitable. Pics included...."}
{"text":"They have no right to charge what they do ($11.25) per dish in such a dive place!  Their food is at best ordinary, not any better than mall food.  The lunch special is mostly fried rice & noodles which doesn't leave much room for the entre.  It is insulting that they reopen and immediately raise their prices.  The menu was new but had crossed out prices with higher prices written with black marker.  They had a sign in the window \"2 for 1 Baba drinks\" & a guy came in to get two drinks & they didn't have any so he left.  Also they have noisy Coke coolers that run way to loud.  They need to work on the interior: table cloths, better chairs & tables that all match, dump the old booths, fix the hole in the wall, get decent menus, put up some kind of window treatment so diners don't see all the crack addicts walking by.  At best this is a take out place, not nice enough for guest dining.  I'm sad that Wok My World is gone, the food was so much better & cheaper.  It wasn't very pretty inside but the food made up for it.  Now, this place is ugly, food is not very good & the prices are too high.  Good luck to them, they will need it."}
{"text":"I have had a hard time finding good Chinese food since I moved in August. This place was great.  They have a wonderful lunch special that runs everyday until 4 and the portions are very big. The employees are kind as well."}
{"text":"This place is gem. A big thanks to our young server Yuijun. (Hoping this is the right one) Delicious food and outstanding customer service. My family and I will definitely come back to this restaurant. You exceeded our expectations! Until next time!"}
{"text":"Ordered Kung Pao Chicken and Terraki Chicken.  Large sized portions.  Tastes like authentic Chinese food.  Better than the meals at Panda Express.  Crab ragoons, wantons and spring rolls were all tasty.  Priced right! A lot of food for the cost."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here. I got a Wor wonton soup and spring rolls and Oh My goodness. The spring rolls tasted so fresh and just an overall great flavor. One of the best wonton soups I've ever tasted! I devoured it. I will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"I returned to China Passion yesterday because the owner Wei invited me back and I am glad he did. I ordered Kung Pao Beef and Chicken Chop Suey and both were really delicious !! The veggies in each dish were prepared perfectly with still a bit of crunch to them; the noodles are done just enough with the right amount of sauce and the fried rice was fluffy and had no grease whatsoever. Everything was so well prepared you'd almost think you were eating at a health food restaurant but with all of those great Chinese flavors. And yes the portions are big but I like that for leftovers the next day.So with a concerned owner and great food it's a place to try and I will recommend it to family, friends and neighbors !!"}
{"text":"I just live around the corner of this place and I'd say this is the best Chinese restaurant in the East side of Vegas. I don't have to drive 20-30 minutes to Chinatown whenever I crave for Chinese food. Their servings are huge and they always give appetizers for free! Everything tastes good. Bringing a friend from out of town here never fails each time. They love the place as much as I do.    It's underrated in such a way that whenever I come here, there are few people around."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in northern vegas. Great lunch specials and the chicken egg rolls are amazing.  The fried rice and chow mein was delicious. My only complaint is that they only do half fried rice and chow mein with lunch specials only.  They will not do it for dinner. They make you by both full sizes which is way too much for one person. Other than that great food. The garlic chicken is a fan favorite."}
{"text":"The service is always very good and friendly. The food is delicious. We order delivery quite a bit and it's always hot and on time. This is our go to quick Chinese food spot"}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food huge portions, is now my new fav Chinese delivery!!! Keep up great work!!!"}
{"text":"This is our new go-to place for Chinese pick-up.  The food is awesome!  They lost a start for forgetting to include the sauce for the Pot Stickers.  We will be back and will check the order before leaving next time."}
{"text":"China passion #1 !! First time here came on Christmas Day and they were opened! Immediately greeted by young man server, for dine in. While we decided what to order crispy things were brought out (YUM!) Decided on a combination plate, salt and pepper pork chips, also ended up getting egg rolls and egg drop soup (which I think was called egg flour soup on the menu?)  The food took regular amount of time to be served, egg drop soup was amazing! It was cold outside so it was very satisfying, good taste, not bland at all. When the entrees came out I was very surprised, not expecting huge quantities!! Definitely a huge bonus as this is not only lunch but leftovers for dinner as well!  The salt and pepper pork chop came with steamed rice, with options to upgrade to fried rice or noodles. Salt and pepper pork chop #1. Generous portions some bone in pieces, it was completely satisfying and even though this is the first thing I tried here, I would have to say this is my favorite!  The egg rolls were good as well, and the service was on point! Young man was very nice, super polite and checked up on us the right amount.   I will definitely be coming back here (:   BONUS: came back later that same day to order more food, got salt pepper calamari, sesame chicken, Mongolian beef, and an order of combination fried rice. Seriously everything was delicious, same great portions, no complaints whatsoever."}
{"text":"Chicken Pad Tai was really good.   All 5 of us really liked everything we had.  Coming back again. I am sure."}
{"text":"I love the seasoning and taste of the food I ordered I will definitely recommend to my family and friends"}
{"text":"This is our second time here. Again, service is fast and friendly. The food is great! We did the lunch specials this time. $6.25' We took half home, there was so much food.  They comped us egg rolls and cream cheese stuffed wontons.   For 3 lunch specials, 1 soda and a 20% tip(because they deserved it) it came to $25.91 and we've got dinner for later.  Love this place."}
{"text":"From the first bite to the last bite the food is amazing the Mongolian beef to the combination rice and chow main very tasty.I definitely will be ordering from them again"}
