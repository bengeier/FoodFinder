{"text":"This review is strictly about their Indian lunch special of tandoori chicken and \"curry\" sides. While the portions were ample and filling, I almost wish they had given me less - every item was a kind of non-distinctive slop. I might as well have been eating slightly Indian-flavored air. The gyros looked lovely, so I don't want to write this place off completely - but it's a no-go for Indian."}
{"text":"Very fast service. The couple the owns Bombay are very nice and generous. I had the tikka masala which was wonderful. Portions were very big. We will be returning for lunch again."}
{"text":"Awesome Food & Gracious cook. I like the the way he serve me the food on off lunch timing as a overwhelming host..."}
{"text":"Cheap and fast Indian lunch special:  $5.95 gets you a substantial piece of grilled flat bread (chose white, brown, or pita), rice, and three dishes.  When I went there were only four to chose from: a pleasantly spicy but a little runny saag paneer, soft yellow cabbage, and two chicken dishes, tikki masala and chicken curry.  So not the best spot for vegetarians, but better flavors than Sree's.  I was in and out in less than five minutes!"}
{"text":"Terrible service to first time customer here for a conference. I ordered a gyro. on my own. Then he took the next order behind me and fixed their 3 orders first without starting my gyro. I overheard they were regulars. I left...I don't have time for this. Maybe good if you're in the inner circle but this out of towner is not impressed."}
{"text":"This place is a find. It's kind of a charming, petite place with one small counter dining space along an exposed brick wall. More importantly, the people are really nice and service oriented and most importantly -  the food is delicious!  Great gyros and an eclectic mix of other really good fast foods!"}
{"text":"The place is somewhat depressing but the gyros are pretty good.  It's also the closest place to grab food outside the Westin."}
{"text":"Walked in at 11:20 for lunch and absolutely nothing was ready. Couldn't get fries. Nothing in the warmer trays. Had to wait 15 minutes for a gyro of mediocre quality. And \"spicy\" was just a squirt of sriracha sauce added."}
{"text":"Quick, easy, and delicious gyros and fresh made fries!  I didn't want to venture too far from my hotel for dinner with the 7 year old while my husband was working.  I love that they had regular offerings like chicken tenders, burgers and hot dogs for the not so adventurous types.  The gyro was very good with the usual toppings, sriracha as an option (do it!)  The kiddo got chicken tenders which were pretty generic frozen ones, but he seemed to like them.  You can get your fries seasoned with season salt or regular.  I love the season salt for an extra kick.  The person behind the counter was very friendly!"}
{"text":"In town for business, staying across the street, but the \"gyros\" sign kept calling me. Went in, got a gyro with everything. They asked if I wanted it spicy, and I said yes. I received one of the best gyros I've ever had. The siracha complimented the sauce so well. Highly recommended. Not much of a place to sit there. Go to a park and enjoy."}
{"text":"Give this place a try!  I ran in just at closing time after a long day at the Conference Center.  Most of the food and such had been put away or cleaned. The cook graciously messed everything up, cut a fresh tomato and prepared my small take out order with attention to every detail. His kindness would have been enough for a good review, but the food was AMAZING!  Much the cheapest meal I've had on my business trip and the second tastiest.  Gyro and fries!"}
{"text":"I stopped in Bombay's yesterday around two for lunch. Who would expect to find a truly amazing Gyro at a place named Bombay's?  They serve Indian food, gyros, and burgers.  So it is definitely an odd mix-up, but I would try anything here.  I ordered a gyro ($6.11 w tax), and the friendly guy behind the counter chatted with me throughout the assembly after seeing my student ID.  He asked me if I wanted Sriracha or pickled vegetables on the gyro. At first I was surprised, but how awesome is that?!?  I did opt for some Sriracha, which was genius. The lamb was fantastic and perfectly spiced and cooked. The best part was that he did not just glob on the tzatziki sauce, it was spread thin and even. Score.   Between the cheap as can be prices and awesome employee, I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this little spot from my hotel room for days and finally came by for lunch in an effort to not eat the convention center box lunch.  I tried the Indian lunchbox of sorts with rice, curry chicken, tandoori, spicy cabbage and garbanzo beans. I'm pleasantly surprised by the spice on the cabbage. Really can't be beat for the inexpensive meals and truly great service of a mom & pop downtown shop.   They also have traditional lamb gyros, chicken gyros and falafel- it was hard to just choose one thing!   I must say, their grilled pita to dip in these sauces is quite an unexpected delightful lunch. So glad I skipped the convention center box lunch today! Had to dock a star for the heat inside- just come ready to sweat while you wait and expect to take everything to go."}
{"text":"Walked in. Just asked for the gyro lunch special. And it was amazing! As is...however he usually makes it... BOMB!!! just had him put very little siracha....but it was so oooooo tasty!!!"}
{"text":"In town for a convention. Had gyros and a burgers for lunch great value, great tasting gyros."}
{"text":"I had the lunch box.. it was not that good.. they should give it in a big takeaway plate. Right now they just put it on top of the rice."}
{"text":"besides being a great value, the food is amazing.  i have tried it a week ago and had the tikka masala with a side of a pea dish. both were excellent, nicely spiced without being too spicy. the 2nd time i went was yesterday and unfortunately at 2pm they were sold out of the indian dishes, though you could still order a gyro. i was instructed to arrive earlier for the indian food. i went back again today and boy am i glad i did.  there was delicious chicken curry, again the tikka masala(which is my new favorite) and i had spinach with indian spices with a side of pita. and a variety of other dishes along with good quality rice. great portions, excellent flavors and good customer service."}
{"text":"The elusive five stars.  Forget Sree's, this place is the cooler, tastier sibling.  Not much in the way of ambience, but the food makes up for it.  Choose 3 from about 8 different dishes, some with meat and some vegan.  Choices change daily, and I've never been disappointed.  From Indian curries to a Pakistani ground meat dish that was amazing, you really can't go wrong.  Plus, the amount of food they heap on for $7 is almost ridiculous.  I always have leftovers for a late afternoon snack!  They also serve burgers, and I see many gyros going out the door, but with all of the traditional dishes, I have yet to try anything else.  the owners are great.  Giving 5 stars wasn't even a question.  One tip:  Get there by about 1:15 PM or the choices may be limited."}
{"text":"They have a daily special of rice, bread(flat bread), and 3 curries. It's just a little hole in the wall with a small lunch line style counter. Great flavor! In all 3 curries. The guy next to me got a gyro and it looked great. If the place had any kind on dining area, ambience, or more than 1 guy serving everybody...it would rule the street. But the line out the door proves they probably do."}
{"text":"Bombay Gyro...yeah, ok...go ahead...giggle. Because I know, whenever you think India, you think Gyro, right? I mean it's kind of like thinking of Turkey when you think of Pizza. Oh, wait, half of the smaller pizza chains in town are Turkish owned...and quite frankly, they're pretty darned GOOD! Well, you can think the same way about Bombay Gyro and Lunch Box.  Located down the side block from Tonic in a very small hole in the wall space, two handsome Indian guys serve up a very quick, varied, inexpensive and tasty lunch.  You have the usual American offerings of subs, burgers and other sandwiches, along with their typical sides of fries, jalapeno poppers and such, then the gyros and felafel - which quite frankly, the actual quality of the gyro meat is better than the raved about Mike & Tony's. They're simple, but for the gyro alone, it's only $5, add fries, and it's $6. For $6.50, throw in a soft drink. They have all the basic toppings for the gyro as well, lettuce, tomato, onion, cucumber sauce, sriracha, etc.   In addition, they also have a daily hot plate from their homeland, which is basic, but flavorful. For $6 you get a grilled flatbread, rice, and your choice of three curries from a selection of four. Two meat, and two veggie. Usually the meat is chicken, but they may also surprise you with lamb. Now this isn't the PRIMO Indian food, kind of watered down to please the burghites, but it is more flavorful (as someone else had mentioned) than Sree's (and I adore Mrs. Sree - her samosas kick!).  But from a personal preference, I think Sree's uses only breast meat chicken (and I have NEVER been a breast man) where Bombay uses more of a mix of white and dark meat, which to me has more juice and flavor. The rice is flavorful, the flatbread...well, it's lightly grilled flatbread. It is what it is.  But it's all served up very quickly, and the guys are very friendly and efficient.  As I said, this isn't gourmet foodie heaven, but for a REALLY inexpensive lunch option in dismal downtown, it's a pretty refreshing change - you'll be filled and not disappointed, for well under $10.  And the eye candy in line, though not quite as stellar as over at Istanbul Grille, can be a mighty nice distraction while you're waiting.   Namaste - n'at!"}
{"text":"So, so sad to find out that this little family restaurant will lose its lease at the end of October 2017, and I'm kicking myself for not writing a review sooner.  Good gyros, but AMAZING CURRIES!  Seriously, absolutely delicious scratch-made Indian food made by a talented chef and his family, who are all the loveliest people to boot.  I hope so much that they find a new location downtown.  Meanwhile, do yourself a favor and get an Indian lunch box there before the end of October!"}
{"text":"Just arrived at the hotel from a long day of flights. Left central Texas about 5 am and didn't get to stop for food all day. I found the reviews, and after learning the restaurant was close we decided to check it out. We were at the point of HANGRY, luckily it was directly across the street from our hotel. We ordered gyros & fries the food was so fresh and made to order. Not much seating, but I recommend it for a quick bite or carry out. Great way to start our trip!"}
{"text":"Perfect for lunch. Fast n delicious. The curries are good. You can choose three with bread and rice."}
{"text":"Cheap, quick and easy is just how I like my curry. The aloo baingan, or as I call it the 'eggplant potato-y thing,' is my hands down favorite dish when they have it. The convenience of this place coupled with the delicious/copious foodstuffs is unparalleled and the guys who run the joint are stand up individuals.  I like this place more than Sree's. There, I said it!"}
{"text":"ETHNIC CONFUSION? NO WAY!  I'm gonna go ahead and give this a 5. \"Hole in the wall\" as a description of a place is never a derogatory comment in my universe and more of a compliment, but only if the food absolutely rocks - which it did! And, as a bonus, the concept just blew me away.   Meat spinning on a spit and Greek specialties on the menu, with Indian specialties off to the other side - seems like ethnic confusion, right?  Well, let me tell you, right down to the sauce, the gyro absolutely rocked! I was eating it and it was like I never wanted it to end. I am in town for the weekend and I am going to have to grab one on my way out. The only thing better than one of these is TWO of them. No joke, yo!  If you are in Pittsburgh, go an get a gyro from these people and Yelp about them but good. I want this place to be here when I come back. The food speaks for itself so I'm sure there are no worries but, yelp speaks for food. Good eating to all of you and well, well, well done, Bombay!"}
{"text":"Finally gave this place a try.  I'll be visiting more often now that I know how good it is.  If you are unsure, just walk in and take a look."}
