{"text":"Tres bonne pizza. Simple mais à très bon goût.  La place est aussi pas mal joli et bien placée sur le petit laurier.  L'alcool est un peu dispendieux mais c'est acceptable tout de même.  Le service était un peu lent mais pas mal agréable.  Le prix global est tres raisonnable. A conseiller."}
{"text":"Really not sure what all the hype is about. This place serves overpriced, flavorless, uninspired pizza in a pretentious environment. I had high hopes after reading the reviews but...ughh!! The crust is a disaster!! Over 6 days in Montreal, this was by far the worst meal I had. There are better choices throughout the neighborhood.."}
{"text":"A wonderful neighbourhood pizzeria!! Coming from the United States, had to say that the Margarita Pizza was outstanding! No wait to get in, attentive waiters/waitresses. Loved the music they were playing! The house music with a beautiful disco beat made me feel good! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My partner and I stayed at an airbnb quite close to Stella Pizzeria. After several active days and nights out, we were ready for a low key evening. We figured the neighborhood pizza place would be fine and easy. We were right about easy but it was so much better than fine. Really nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and great food. The tuna tartare was one of among my favorite dishes of the trip and the pizza was really tasty. This place was just as satisfying as the restaurants we specifically sought out based on excellent reviews, minus the lines and the crowds. We left very happy."}
{"text":"Bon Etablissement,le personnel est charmant. Je vous conseille l'entrée au thon. La préparation de gnocchi est bonne. Un endroit sympa dans le quartier. C'est la deuxième fois que j'y mange et je trouve la qualité égale  ."}
{"text":"Mon gros coup de coeur de la soirée. Excellente pizza avec une croûte mince et croustillante, de la vraie mozzarella di Buffala,  mélange d'ingrédients authentiques. La sauce est excellente.   Le service est sympathique. Pas très cher non plus. 30$ incluant alcool, taxes, pourboires"}
{"text":"Nice music, delicate ambiance and food to match. Stella, although in its infancy is turning out to be quite a nice evening choice for couples our groups wanting that out of the place 'gourmet' experience without having to go into central Montreal or out of the plateau area. Reasonable prices and the owner/host is incredibly thoughtful and compliant. Tuna tartare I had was great, light and went perfectly with the wine I was offered. Tiramisu is adequate but needs more crunch. Wine selection is good. Personal opinion; will come back but in the evening."}
{"text":"lovely neighborhood pizza , pasta and other specialties. very fresh and flavorful. full bar and nice wine list. highly recommend for casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I gotta say - the anchovies were extremely overwhelming - not the way you want to experience anchovies, trust me. The whole pizza was ruined with dominating fishiness, which was buried under many other toppings so that you couldn't even pick them off. My advice: totally avoid anything anchovy in this restaurant. Also, the crust was burnt. And, we were rushed. I really don't think a restaurant should agree to serve a table if said table isn't going to have enough time to actually sit down and think about their order for five minutes without being pressured into making a choice. Totally unsatisfactory experience for me, and my son (who ended up with the anchovy pizza because he doesn't read French and didn't know what he was ordering). I felt like I wasted my money, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Pizza was good It's interesting to try the food from a true chef from Puglia. They uses great fresh ingredients on their pizza but unfortunately they were overcooked."}
{"text":"We had an excellent light supper here upon arrival in Montreal.  Nice and peaceful on a November Tuesday afternoon, and my gal was observing her birthday, so really relished the pizza margarita (her personal fav/benchmark).  I had a great salad special that really hit the spot after a long frosty drive. We enjoyed the street theater from the package store next door, and had a couple glasses of cava to celebrate our arrival and such.  The proprieter was our server and gave us a friendly welcome to the city, as we worked out communications across our various language barriers, including the tableside card swiper and french instructions for tip etc on its display.  Throughout our visit we saw people walking around the neighborhood with takeout boxes, so that is a great option as well.    We sat below a poster of Lisa Leblanc and it kind of set the theme for our whole visit - an au naturel women kicking up up her heels and putting down the truth.  Tres Montreal.  A lovely neighborhood spot that is a true work of love - kudos to the chef and the front of house partner making it so!"}
{"text":"Très bonne pizzas et très bonnes pâtes, on s'est régalés ! Une super adresse de quartier !   Le plus : on peut commander à emporter. Le moins : petite déception sur les desserts"}
{"text":"Solid neighborhood pizzeria. My husband had the tuna tartare appetizer which he thought was excellent. My son and I tried the Margarita and Mediterranean pizzas. The crusts were excellent and the toppings well prepared though the tomato sauce was thinner than we're used to. Very good service, nice decor and excellent wine selection by the glass. One star deducted for the grating techno music."}
{"text":"Great pizzeria with a warm atmosphere and very friendly staff. The cheese in the caprese salad was outstanding and the stella pizza was excellent. We definitely recommend to end the meal with the Nutella pizza! Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"This little pizza shop has great pizza. We got the 4 cheese and had sauce added to it. The only downfall is if you want to drink alcohol up cannot sit outside. I'm guessing this is a law in Montreal, but I'm not sure. I had the sangria and it was great. If you are not someone that speaks French like me, then you have nothing to worry about the staff speaks great English."}
{"text":"Super duper resto,un resto de banlieue chick pas trop cher et décor très classe. Je suis amateur de piz et j'ai jamais manger de piz à croûte croustillantes la réponse est estomaquante 9.5/10"}
{"text":"2eme visite et toujours déçue... les pizzas sont bonnes mais pas excellentes... L'ambiance est beaucoup trop guindé pour ce genre de place, et que dire du staff, qui est très désagréable, 2 fois de suite...  si vous voulez un petit conseil, continuez votre chemin sur laurier, vous y trouverez un endroit bien plus accueillant et agréable, avec de la très bonne bouffe!"}
