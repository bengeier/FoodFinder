{"text":"Unfortunately I go here quite often, sometimes I even buy a burger to go with the mayonnaise they give you. I get 30 minutes for a break at work and most of it is spent waiting for my \"fast\" food since any car that goes into the drive through gets instant priority over my food. Waited 20 minutes for a single poutine.  They overcook anything deep fried. Bought jalape√±o poppers and the breading was cooked to a rock while the inside was still frozen. If you are in a hurry and looking for some fast mediocre food, don't go here."}
{"text":"I usually go for their whoppers and sometimes fish sandwiches. I have always found the chicken sandwich to be too salty for my taste. They have recently renovated this restaurant and have added some new smoothies and cafe-style drinks to their menu, which I have not tried.. and am not sure if I ever will.   The whoppers are always fresh and juicy.. I have not had any problems with the staff at this location. I just find that since their renovation there seem to be fewer seats for dine-in customers. The interior is nicely designed but unable to accommodate large crowds."}
{"text":"The worst service in the fast food restaurant in north America hands done.  Talked to the manager anout being in a 6 person line for 25 minutes to order.  Of course English was her second language so it was deer in the head lights.  Should've stuck with McDonald's"}
{"text":"This Burger King is shut down! I was wondering why the service was terrible and now I know, the employees must have seen it coming because they didn't give a @#$% about you or your order! Good Riddance!!!"}
{"text":"Disgusting behaviour and customer service. See Google for the full review! Lectured, argued with a manager for insulting me in front of my 2 children, offended by a 40 year old cashier and asked to pull back around the building to a handicap spot to spare their timer. This after paying for my food and asking why Beyond upset at the incident"}
{"text":"I've only been to this Burger King twice in my life and each time I had to pull over to the front of the building after going to the drive-thru & paid even and had to wait for my food?? You must know that my orders are very basic and I order right off the menu.. no special orders here.   Why do I have to wait for a Junior whopper and fries??   I was under the impression this was fast food? As I am typing this review at this moment waiting for my food to be brought out .. its already been almost 10 min.. and two more cars are pulling up and waiting for their food too just like me?? Whats up with this Burger King??? I will not be returning.. One star is even being nice!!!!! Its 5:00 on a weekday!! What a disgrace to this fast food chain!!"}
{"text":"Screaming toddler, and mom obliviously chatting on her iPhone, check. Surly staff, check. Cleaning staff who won't think twice about trying to \"clean up\" your bag of stuff from Superstore, check!  That last one is the reason I will never set foot inside this place again. Yes, it's clean and shiny and new, and the food was good, but having a staff member attempt to throw my Superstore bag out and claim he was \"cleaning\" didn't go over well.  I was sitting at my table enjoying my chicken sandwich, and surfing on my iPad, when the gentleman cleaning the lobby walked by my table, and picked up one of my bags from Superstore. When I said something, he mumbled that he was \"cleaning garbage\". I politely took my bag from him, and set it back down. He mumbled something in another language and walked away. Not quite sure why he wanted my bag of t shirts and lettuce from superstore, but he certainly tried his hardest to grab it.  Upon finishing my meal, I went to the counter and asked to speak to a manager. When I was asked why, I said I had a concern I wanted to speak to the manager about. I was told \"the manager doesn't have time for you\" and to email them. No. I want a manager, and I want one to physically talk to me, not to have one email me. After asking a second and third time, I finally spoke to a manager on duty. Still not enough for me to go back. It's a shame, too. I love their chicken sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is the MOST disgusting Burger King we h ave ever gone to.  We thought the first time we went that maybe it was an \"off day\" so we gave it a second try 3 days later. The trash bins all had ketchup smeared all over the doors making it filthy to throw anything in them (both days).  The tables and high chairs were FILTHY. Fortunately I had sanitary wipes and cleaned everything before we let the children sit and eat.  We were warned by another mom to NOT take a child in the woman's restroom because it was so dirty.  She said it was better to go outside behind a tree than risk it.  My husband finally took our granddaughter in the men's room which was slightly better, but NO soap in the dispensers. When he reported it to the staff they acted totally uninterested.  We had to sanitize the kids hands and arms the moment we left and we went to McDonalds for their ice cream.  This place ruined the Burger King franchize for us....BOTH times we went there."}
{"text":"I don't know how this happened, but I got suckered into tagging along with a girlfriend of mine who was hosting a birthday party for her 2 year old. Oh goody.  I'll be honest, I don't like a lot of 'child noise', so in hindsight, I really should have come up with a better excuse than \"Oh...uh... well I have somewhere to be in a couple of hours...\".  I clearly made it out alive however, and thank God I did, because now, I have lived to tell you all about it.  This Burger King is BIG, and what I especailly LOVED about it is that they have a kids play area! They have a HUUUGE slide, and an indoor playground for the kidlets to burn off all that energy after having eaten their meals.  The staff was wonderful, INSANELY PATIENT, but I gotta warn you, this place was BU-SY. We did go on a weekend however, and we were taking up half the restaurant, but you gotta time it right so that when you do go, you're not crowded in with everyone and their dog (just a saying).  Overall, I was most impressed with the play space and the staff - who again - were as patient as saints.  A good experience, but you can BET you wont see me there again on a weekend!"}
{"text":"I will go out of my way to avoid this Burger King location. 15 minutes trapped in the drive through with no option to escape due to the walled-in layout, order was wrong, and didn't even get my receipt.   With fast food - the food is predictable and service is King. It's a shame because this \"King\" dropped the ball in a big way."}
{"text":"This is one of if not the worst BK in Calgary. Count on your food being cold and your order incorrect. Staff are not exactly customer service oriented. Last visit at the drive through I paid for bacon and cheese and my chicken sandwich and received neither."}
{"text":"Wow, I hadn't tried Burger King until recently and it blew all the other competition out of the water! It's actually so flavourful and each burger has it's own distinct taste... they don't all taste the same (like at McDonalds) or have no real flavour (like Wendy's).  The only reason they don't get full stars is that you DO pay quite a bit of money, for a fast food joint... the burgers are huge... but I don't really need that much and 1/4 or more gets wasted."}
{"text":"It always seemed like it was a hassle for the employees to make food the way I asked. I have a real picky son who wants plain burger with cheese. Simple yet so difficult for them to give me. I rolled past today and saw that it was no longer open and all signs had been taken down."}
{"text":"This place deserves zero starts very rude. I was two min late for breakfast okay I understand so I need to decide what else to pick well after a minute and a half in drive thru they are telling me I have to leave or order now. I'm the only one in the drive thru and trying to decide on the board what to buy. So I order and get to the window and they ladie is very rude her name was joy. Sure wasn't joyful. Then as I go to pay she mumbles under her breath and swears so I ask her what she said she gets all defensive and tell me to leave. Very rude and unprofessional never go here I will never go here again"}
{"text":"It's CLOSED. Gone. Totally empty. And this was the best Burger King I've seen in Charlotte. Not happy for the employees. They were some of the best too."}
{"text":"You cant use whopper coupons on wednesdays because its KING DEAL day for whopper, the day i only stop by if im in the area to grab a whopper.  NEVER use the drivethrough, they always screw you at the drive through, as joe pesci would say.  I go in and know the manager of the location, if they are there I ask for my burger to be done extra, as I dont like grey meat, i like a little bit of char please.    I inspect it and watch them making it, if anything is up I smash it like gordon ramsey and order it redone..LOL.  Its worth it as I like to sit down and eat my burger hot and the fries hot with plenty of mayo ( yes I picked this up travelling europe, all the fast food places dont have ketchup, just mayo, so I developed a taste for this).    Through my college years there was a time when BK's burgers where 2 for 5$, which became all I ate for an entire month until the deal was done, so I have plenty of experience with the whopper LOL me and her go way back, and it is a tasty treat for pennies.    I've had the same expereicnes as Helene at drive throughs across the US and canada where BK's performance is lacking and would give them the same rating, but this location I cant, as I dont use the drive through, as I got to know the managers and expect a level of service that only this location (NO OTHER LOCATION, EVEN THOSE CLOSEST TO ME ROFL) can provide.  I guess it stems from the close cineplex and chapters, as well as Blu's fish market for fresh caught 48hrs ago fish.."}
{"text":"Cold food and a staff that could not get it right! Training is needed at this location for the afternoon staff. I have eaten here in the AM and not had these problems. For a ~32 dollars order I want better."}
{"text":"Omg- horror!!! This place is filthy and the help is atrocious. I am here to get food for my co workers and I'm standing here thanking god it isn't for me There is actual trash on the floor in the kitchen. Not to mention the fact that I am one of 2 people in the place and I've so far been waiting 14 minutes for 4 hamburgers I have zero idea how this place is even in business!  I'm just thankful I won't be eating this"}
{"text":"I studied queuing theory at school but I was not prepared for the chaotic poetry witnessed on 2.50 nugget day. The free pop refills added an extra layer of complexity. Bk stacker and chicken fries all day."}
{"text":"The only BK in the far SE and S.W. of Calgary.   Drive through available and lots sitting area.   Food is hit and miss with the fries just never tasting as good as McDonald's.   Staff is friendly and sitting area has lots of booths.   My fav is the chicken sandwich. BK fans rejoice."}
{"text":"Cashiers like to smoke right outside the entrance and open to the door while doing so to talk to their friends.  Annoying, young and unprofessional staff"}
{"text":"These employees simply have no fucks to give. They have run out of fucks. Probably why they work at BK. No rodeo burger, NO STARS!"}
{"text":"Terrible!!! I normally cut fast food places slack but really this place should come with a huge warning label. I'm not sure if its possible to put a pound of mayo on burger but they try. The fries were old and gross, they missed the kids toy in the bag, all the kids food was just dumped in the bags, the drinks were 80% ice, the lady at the DT was extremely impatient. \"Is that all? Is that all? Is that all? Is that all?\" Won't go back."}
{"text":"The customer service at this one sucks so bad, I know every one has a bad day but to have that bad day every week is pretty bad. Don't eat here if you are on the go and don't already have napkins in your car, because they are not going to offer napkins or anything else to you. When you ask for napkins they give you just one so if you have more than one order everybody has to share so good luck with that. And the attitudes are just nasty, the guys act as if the money is coming out if their checks to pay for good customer service and napkins."}
{"text":"staff was super rude at this location. who charges .11 for bbq sauce? definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"So incredibly nasty...it's 8 am Monday morning and I'm the only one here.  There are two people working and although the grade is 99, the entire place is nasty...greasy doors, food on the floor, every counter I looked at was streaked and grimy. They were sooo nice and the coffee was great, hash browns cold.  I wouldn't leave any stars if there were an option"}
{"text":"The only reason this place has 1 star is because you can't give minus scores!  I went there yesterday and order 2 spicy chicken sandwich and took them to work. When I bit into the first one I immediately spit it out! It tasted like moldy bread. I looked at the sandwich and didn't actually see any mold so it must have been on the verge of growing hair! When I called to complain to the manager she was very rude and dismissive. Then hung up on me. Not being one to be dismissed so easily went to the store and returned there gross crap. And vocally told them what was wrong with there product in front of the other customers. Will never return!"}
{"text":"Always slow service even though food is not hot when you get it. Workers are short tempered with children in a fast food joint with a kid's play area. Manager yelled at my daughter not to play with the door when she was simply trying to open it. The play area is the only reason we go here. This time we got yelled at for nothing. Last time we tried to come the play area was locked at 5:45 pm. We'll be skipping this spot and heading 5 mins further down the road to cleaner, friendlier, kid friendly places."}
{"text":"Worst Burger King ever. Girl at the drive thru threw the debt machine at me and when I gave it back she grabbed it so hard it hit the window and she dropped it. I asked if I did something and she said well you're rude and parked so far away.. excuse me? There's a bunch of snow sorry.. not like I wasn't in reaching distance.. rolled her eyes at me then she gave me my order which was wrong. And then threw the right order at me. Asked to speak to the manger she said it was her.. blown away.. I work at a dental office and I'd love to see you come in to my place of work and be treated that :)"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because most of the more recent time I've had BK Whoppers, I've been in the States, but aren't BK burgers usually supposed to be flame-grilled?  The ones at this location definitely aren't.  They're made in one of those steamer things (or, at least, that's what it tastes like).  This location has turned me off BK, I think.  The ones in the States, though-- pretty good.  There's a play gymnasium for kids at this location, so it's great if you have small kids, but it's really loud if you don't."}
{"text":"I got pulled in with the lure of two spicy sandwiches for five bucks post workout. The fish sandwich had real jalape√±os in it and the chicken sandwich had some sweet marmalade looking sauce with a bit of a tang.   Did I inhale both of them? I did indeed. Do I regret this caloric expenditure? I do indeed.  It could've been worse. I could've gone for a slice of chocolate sundae pie or an apple turnover in addition to my most recent regret. So I feel ok about the situation."}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't review BK, but this is a terrible location.  The only reason they even get two stars is because of their whopper.  This review will be based primarily on the drive thru.  To start, If the drive thu was run by an orangutan I think the service would be better than the defectives I dealt with.  Don't use coupons here either folks!  If you bought Entertainment books to support your kids school or team, forget about using those coupons at this location!  These yahoo's make up their own arbitrary rules of when you can and can't use them (no coupons for whoppers allowed on Wednesday y'all!) and BTW you can't use them with value meals when no where on the coupon it says that.  McDonalds has no exclusion on their coupons for specific days or value meals.    They demand the coupon right as you pull up to the window and read both sides and the fine print when its an Entertainment Book coupon, these coupons, with exception to the date, never change!! I've purchased these books for the past 5 years and they are always the same! They won't even give you a total till you drive up so you are digging through your change while they eye-ball fuck you to hurry up.  If you order from here always double check your order because they often never give you a receipt if they accept the precious coupon.  On more than one occasion they stiffed my kid out of ketchup, sauce and nuggets (thats right folks, pay for a 6 piece and they give you a 4) or they will give you a girl toy for a boy and vice versa and if they are feeling exceptionally  assholish they will not give you a toy at all!  And the pop is always really watered down or just flat, especially the root beer.  They will also overcharge you if they decide to do you a favour and accept the coupon.  Of course you will have to pay for the discrepancy and only notice when you get home that you really didn't save anything because they \"forgot\" to punch it in, whilst making sweet love to its terms and conditions prior.  So done with this BK, which sucks because its mere blocks from my place.  Good thing my girl Wendy's is just down the street."}
{"text":"Normally I try to avoid the big-box, fast food chains, but this location is a bit sentimental for me.  It has always been here (as far as I can remember) since I have been in Charlotte, so it's gone through some renovations.  I still remember going to this BK on the way home from school or when we were out running errands.  The staff is pretty friendly and very efficient.  Never really had a bad experience here.  My newest experience was with the new 20 piece nuggets they offer.  I dived right in and also made it a combo....  I got about halfway through and realized that 20 nuggets is WAAAAAAYYYY too much for just one person.  I guess that's why the guy looked at me funny when I ordered.  I HATE to waste food, so I powered through it.  And then got home and rolled around on the floor with a tummy ache for about 30min.  The nuggets themselves are pretty good.  Its if McDonald's nuggets and Wendy's nuggets had an illegitimate love child.  That's how I would describe the new nuggets at BK."}
{"text":"Says 24 hours but that's a lie at this location second time I've gone there and the drive thru is closed. Pretty annoyed plus the fries normally suck and taste hours old plus they douse their burgers in mayo and ketchup ! Ask for extra napkins even though they probably won't give it to you."}
