{"text":"Will give them 4 starts because of the great service and presentation was nice but Unfortunately, most of the food that we ordered tasted bland. From appies to soup to rice dishes. Especially the Tipsy Tapsi which I didn't enjoy at all. The garlic rice was served cold so I had it re-heated for me. The meat was tender but no taste. The tofu and pork belly was a little bit pricey for 4 pieces and tastes okay. Siopao sliders were actually good (the only one I enjoyed). Oohmami soup was kinda bland but the meat was super tender (two tumbs up). Sisig was a little bit burnt. Bagoong rice bowl was okay. I hope they focus more on the flavor. We might visit again."}
{"text":"This was perhaps my favorite restaurant in Calgary. Great food, Filipino food with a bit of refinement. Reasonable prices, great noodles, interesting dishes. Also a different and slightly fancier take than the standard adobo, sisig. A very casual and comfortable atmosphere. Note a big spot, but pretty cozy. Very sad to see it close."}
{"text":"Had the oohmami and it was delicious! Tender pork and nice broth. Think lighter than a bowl of fatty Japanese ramen but more hearty than Vietnamese pho. Definitely coming back to try their rice dishes. The chef greeted us himself so great service :)"}
{"text":"Oohmami is a gem. Always great service and food! If you haven't tried Filipino food yet, this is a great place to start. If you eat Filipino food regularly, this resto serves It with a more modern twist. I'm not sure if the contemporary Filipino food trend started in LA but Oohmami definitely gets some inspiration from that trendy scene.   I thought I tried most dishes on the menu, but when I went in there today I noticed they added some new items. My favourite main dish is the Bagoong Rice Bowl. Sometimes I take the liberty of asking them to change the accompanying meat in there just for a change of pace."}
{"text":"Convenient place to go to in the SW. Nothing out of the ordinary. The food is a little pricey compared to the other filipino restaurants. The place is little small and you may have to factor in waiting time to get a table. We stopped by to check it out, but going back will be nothing soon."}
{"text":"Great asian fusion food.  I had the bagoong rice bowl which had sweet mangoes and cucumbers sliced in as a refreshing side ...it turned out to be a killer combination of sweet and salty.   My mom had a barbeque chicken that had an amazing tangy marinade, and came with a salad.   Its the best of modern filipino cuisine.  Worth a visit if you love asian cooking or if you just love trying other cuisines."}
{"text":"Finally found the Best Filipino restaurant in Calgary so far. I'm from Toronto and since we arrived here in Calgary in August last year I have been in a mission to find the best Filipino restaurant. I love my food so I know if it's good or not. I thought I won't be finding a good one until before we go back to Toronto. This Filipino restaurant has a twist and everyone can eat the food or dishes even if your not Filipino. I ordered Tipsy-Tapsi and I like the way they presented the food or plating and the taste goes with the presentation, it was delicious. My friend ordered Chicken Mami and for the first time she didn't complain. Normally when she order food from a typical Filipino cooking it's always fatty and she hates it. The price was just right with the quality of the food. It was also nice for the owner to asked us on how we heard or found his restaurant. I will definitely recommend this restaurant and glad that they're modifying the Filipino cooking into a healthy one. Good job!!!  By the way, the reason why I did not give 5 star is because my friend asked for a glass of water and mine was Coke, I had mine correct but my friend was serve with a glass without water. We're the only customer at that time."}
{"text":"This place is temporarily closed. According to the printed sign outside, it said that it is closing temporarily as of May 18th but when we went there on May 14th, it was closed already. No date when they will re-open."}
{"text":"We were just driving around this neighborhood looking for something to eat, saw this as we drive by and decided to check it out. Glad we did, food was great, want really sure what to expect but we finished everything. Had their noodles and pares, both were great. Definitely going to come back again."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I found this place by typing in \"pork belly\" in Yelp. Search and you shall find :)  The atmosphere is fun and inviting, and the 90's R&B music takes me back to the good old days!  Obviously, we got the tofu & pork belly appie, I went with the restaurant namesake (house broth, roast pork, poached chicken & asado sauce) and my sister got the bagoong rice bowl (mango wins us over every time!)  The thing I love about Filipino food is that it does not shy away from flavor. Everything is bold but balanced, and always tasty.   The pork belly alone was worth the trip here. The soy vinaigrette and pickled onions were a good contrast to the saltiness of the meat.  Our entrees were equally as delish, and you could tell they were labors of love.   I'm definitely overdue for another trip back, and next time I'll remember to make room for dessert! Leche flan brulee? Yes please!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited for dinner recently and the food was really delicious! Tried the pulled chicken adobo rice bowl and the oohmami soup. Both were great. Kind of like ramen, but different flavours and meats. The atmosphere here is really chill with some great hip-hop music. We will be back to try more for sure!"}
{"text":"This place isn't perfect yet but it is really, really good! Some of Oohmami's dishes are craving filled dream inducing... so yeah, this place is good! I've only been here twice but I'm sure I'll be back a lot more in the future. Especially if their Instagram continues to be so tempting. ;) The last time I was here I had the siopao sliders, the adobo rice bowl and a sample of the bagoong rice bowl, all of which were very tasty.  Starting with the sliders: They're rather messy to eat but it's worth the mess! That melt in your mouth pork belly in some very nice steamed buns; I'm not sure if they buy or make those buns in house but either way these are spot on! Their sisig tacos I had on my first visit are also super amazing. Have some starters here, you won't regret it.  The Adobo: I haven't had a lot of Filipino food before but this tastes purely of comfort and home and love! It's a bowl filled with chicken, garlic rice, palm vinegar, and a beautiful egg on top. It's hearty, filling, and really, really delicious! Aside from maybe the tacos, this might be my #1 favourite thing I've tried on their menu! Don't miss this!  The Bagoong: A really beautiful bowl with cured pork, salted shrimp rice, mangos and an egg on top. The flavour of this is obviously quite different from the other bowl but don't worry about having mango in a savoury dish, it works perfectly! This has a lighter feel (that's the mango at work) but this will fill you up and then some! Well, that really depends on if you can stop yourself from finishing their generous amounts of deliciousness. The portions at Oohmami aren't outrageously large but both me and my date had to pack up leftovers after being thoroughly stuffed! (°°)~  The noodles: For my first visit I had the Oohpapi (pork dumplings, braised beef, poached chicken.) In one line: I prefer the rice bowls. From what I've gathered on Instagram the noodle soup bowls at Oohmami are much loved and while I did enjoy mine, it's a little light on flavour for my taste. Maybe I just need more exposure to Filipino noodle bowls? But for now the rice bowls have my heart and stomach! ;)  Alright now for some less amazing news... As I said in the beginning, this place is not yet perfect and unfortunately my main concern is about the service. My waiter was certainly attentive and friendly enough so it's most likely a lack of experience. Little things like not bringing the check when the table is cleared and desserts are declined, or not knowing the featured items or finding out without having to be prompted, etc. It's not a big enough deal to make my visit even a little bit unpleasant but hopefully next time those technical things will go smoother.  Overall: Wonderful food! My favourites are the sisig tacos and the Adobo rice bowl. There's not much of an alcohol selection but I'm really there for the food so no complaints. Service could be smoother but the staff is very friendly. The interior is also really beautiful. I can't wait to go back and try more stuff! (Lookin' at you wings and dessert!!) I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! Cheers & enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has a good atmosphere with cool music playing, however, the food was just OK."}
{"text":"The decor is dope.  The food is creative Filipino fusion.  The music is urban.  The air conditioning is on.  I felt transported to Malate. Just started with Siapoa sliders. A first!  The bbq chicken ihaw, was slow-cooked for 6-8 hours, with a unique side salad and in-house dressing and garlic rice.  I will be back.  #masarap #sogood"}
{"text":"The night I was here, I was craving sisig. Man was I disappointed. I am very aware that this place considers themselves as \"contemporary\" but my god that sisig was not sizzling or even warm at all. It was lukewarm in flavour and presentation. The price did not justify it all! Severely disappointed! The sunny side up egg that came with it was cool as well! I was just not impressed. That night they also had an 'isaw' special which is essentially pork intestines on a stick. 3 for $10 sounded like a good deal but when it finally came the serving size was small and kinda pathetic. Also again, it was a little more on the cool side than warm. My friend ordered tofu and pork which had a cool presentation concept but man... the tofu was only fried on the outside... a big no-no. Would suggest those who are looking for authentic filipino food to look elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! If you like noodles \"you gotta dine here\"!!!"}

{"text":"It was Andrew Zimmern of Bizarre Foods that predicted that Filipino cuisine would take the spotlight and become the next big hit of the food world. Since then, we have seen many talented and notable chefs such as Sheldon Simeon, Dale Talde, Miguel Trinidad, and Yana Gilbuena bring their own interpretations of this truly engaging and vastly influenced cuisine to North America. A very welcome arrival for something we as Filipinos have enjoyed all our lives with our family, friends and loved ones.   It warms my heart to see that the Filipino hospitality, coupled with true passion and creativity is alive and well at Oohmami Pares House & Noodle Bar. Upon entering the cozy space, the place is alive with activity, conversation, and classic hip hop beats that bring a sense of nostalgia and familiarity to my being. Chefs and co-owners Saturnino (Sonny) and John greet everyone like family and treat you well. The chefs bar is the perfect spot to watch the action, people watch, or just shoot the breeze.  The menu is a selection of familiar Filipino dishes that have been given a light touch of modern flair and contemporary styling that re-interprets the cuisine, but keeping the flavours that make them distinctly Filipino. The ingredients are fresh and locally sourced, including the noodles for their signature mami bowls which are handmade.   Speaking of the noodle bowls, the mami bowl is a hearty noodle bowl filled with a housemade broth, noodles, chicken, beef, pork, or wontons. You can think of it like a ramen of sorts, but with a style and flavour that is unique, most notably in the broth, which has a more subtle flavour profile than a ramen. It's a filling meal that is both satisfying and comforting.  If you are in the mood for snacks, the selection of appetizers at Oohmami is a spotlight of familiar dishes that are perfect for sharing. My favourite is the wings which I have had in both the adobo and the banana ketchup flavour. Another notable selection is the Sisig tacos, made from local pork, grilled and seasoned to perfection, and served on fresh corn tortillas, topped with fresh scallions, cilantro, pickles onions, and queso fresco. Delicious.   Since I am a rice-aholic, I can't forget the wonderful things Sonny and John do to complement this Asian staple. The Tipsy Tapsy is a refreshing take on the classic tapsilog plate, \"tap\" from beef tapa (cured beef) and \"silog\" being a suffix that's applied to a Filipino breakfast plate with garlic fried rice and a fried egg. The steak is neither cured or cooked to oblivion, but rather given a deliciously savoury and slightly tart marinade, grilling til it's just done. It's tender, juicy, and a the best steak I've had in a while.   The chicken inahaw is a grilled chicken rice bowl that is lightly flavoured with a summery tropic-esque lemongrass essence that is so beautifully incorporated in the meat that it's hard to just eat one bite and give back the fork if you happen to be sharing. Not to mention that the meat is so tender, that you can just eat it with a fork.  It is with a full stomach, a warm heart, and with new friends that wish the crew at Oohmami Pares House & Noodle Bar the best of luck in this truly amazing little restaurant. If you enjoy the vast selection of Asian food in this city, I strongly suggest that you come here and make some new friends of your own. Filipino hospitality is real, it's a wonderful thing, and you will love it."}
{"text":"Te service was very good. The facility was very clean. The food was very delicious. Thank you."}
{"text":"I was excited by all the rave reviews and since I've never tried Filipino food before, I took the whole family to try them out.  This is a small restaurant and was quite busy the day we went.  We went early so we easily got a table, but from about 6:30 on there was a wait at the door.  To start, we got the pork belly & tofu appetizer and the siopao sliders.  Both were quite delicious, although the portion was on the small side.  The restaurant was quite busy so food took quite a while to come out, and as a result we got an order of the vegetarian lumpias on the house.  I prefer lumpias packed with meat, and the vinaigrette came in a squirt bottle which while it was a neat presentation, I prefer my dipping sauce in a small dish.  For our mains I had the abodo chicken, my hubby got the tipsy tapsi and my kids shared the oohmami noodles.  These were much bigger portions but hubby did not really find his main special.  I enjoyed the sweet and savoury sauce of my adobo chicken, but the pork belly add on was definitely a rip off.  There was about 5 small cubes (1/2 an inch or so) for $3.  I just expected something more.  My kids happily ate their noodles and there were a ton of toppings.  The broth was nice and light.  Overall we thought the food was pretty good but I really have to take a star off for atmosphere.  Perhaps the kitchen was trying to drown out the noise from the dining area.  But is playing loud rap music, I mean so loud that we thought we were in a nightclub appropriate? Some of the songs were definitely questionable... Anyhow, come for the food, but the atmosphere may not be very family friendly.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Tacos were good.  Similar to ones at Shiki Menya but Shiki Menya has better filling - meat was more tender.  Given that there's no MSG used in soup base, it's missing the umami taste in soup.  Sugar was used instead of MSG, so it was a bit sweet.  Probably prefer MSG taste I instead.  Dessert was a bit small."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Not a huge selection of dishes but the ones I've tried are awesome. The starters are traditional Filipino snacks with a unique twist and i loved them all.  I had the Mama Mia and it was sooo good. I never knew the traditional Bulalo dish could taste so hood with noodles! Delish!  They serve Filipino beer too!  So if you're a Filipino feeling homesick or may be someone that just wants to try something new, go to Oohmami. You'll like it. My Korean friends did!"}
{"text":"I adore this place. The chefs/servers/owners warmly (and sincerely) welcome you the moment you step inside. The music is fun and reminiscent of my younger days (90s/2000's hip hop/R&B/etc). Best of all, the food is homemade and delicious!   I would highly recommend the beef soup noodles, the nachos and the coconut custard dessert. The broth takes days to make and is made without MSG. The noodles are homemade as well. The beef is flavourful and tender. Next time I drop by, I want to try the bao sliders, spring rolls and tacos.   Just an FYI, the restaurant is closed for another week or so (they are on vacation). Call before you go. Parking is a pain. It's a small restaurant so making a reservation is recommended."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to be invited to the soft opening of this brand new restaurant. I've not been impressed with any Filipino place in Calgary...until now.  Chefs John and Sonny have created a boutique restaurant with classic Filipino flavours stepped up to new heights.  Their house recipe mami noodles are my new favourite...chunky and delicious. I had the oohpapi with beef, chicken and dumpling in a beef broth that has hints of pho but is heartier.  The pork belly with tofu appetizer is amazing. I want more of that! Also try the quikiam for something different. Pork cheeks with shrimp and onion fried into a sausage like appetizer.  I really hope that everyone will try it out when they open next week (hoping for Tuesday, Dec 15 is what I'm told)."}
{"text":"I have a big smile on my face after having lunch here with my hubby today.  We seated ourselves at the bar overlooking the open kitchen and met the two main chefs, Sonny and John.  We tried the quikiam for our starter and it was delicious! It's a meat roll made of pork cheeks and shrimp and wrapped in a dried tofu sheet (which is then lightly fried and sliced).  The flavours of pork, shrimp, and crispy tofu wrapper combined with asado sauce (and topped with homemade julienned carrot and onion pickles and cilantro) complimented each other beautifully.  For my entree, I ordered the Oohmami (house broth, roast pork, poached chicken, asado sauce). Ooh my... First of all, their house broth is steaming hot (just the way I like it) and flavourful.  Their roast pork(neither lechon nor char siu) was amazing--it was browned perfectly and was meltingly tender (all of their roast/braised meats are slow cooked for about 6 to 8 hours, so once they're sold out for the day, you'll just have to come back tomorrow). The same could be said with the poached chicken (tender and juicy).  The noodles (mami), however, were the star of this entree.  These hand-pulled (la mien) Ongpin style noodles are a delightful, toothsome treat (unlike some of the mushy versions of lomi lomi that I've tasted in Vancouver)! Hubby ordered the Tipsy tapsi (ale-marinated Alberta ribeye, fried egg, garlic rice and salad).  It certainly looked and smelled delicious; I managed to steal a nibble of his steak.  Medium rare and seasoned perfectly.    I'm still smiling, because I know that we will be back!"}
{"text":"Really tasty noodle soup! Would totally go back again for the awesome noodles. The noodle here is really chewy and fresh. Our server lady was helpful, polite and attentive. They didn't rush us out of the door instead we stayed and chat and enjoyed the atmosphere. The interior design is interesting. I love the big mirror and open kitchen. The soup could be a little bit more hot as I love my hot hot hot. :) It is a little on the pricey side (although about par as most Raman place) for the bowls were mostly noddles and some ingredients. Overall, really worth trying and would go back again to try different dishes!"}
{"text":"I wanted to lick the plate. Is that clear enough for you? I'm biased, because I have memories of growing up in Manila and experiencing Filipino food in its home and native land. On my first visit I tried the quikiam (pork cheeks wrapped in tofu) and the tipsy-tapsi entree (ale-marinated ribeye served with garlic rice and an egg sunny side up). On my second visit a week later, I had the sisig entree, another \"comfort food\" staple I savoured to the last bite. Their tweaked versions of traditional fare are oh so delicious. I'll be back, often!"}
{"text":"I am so excited that we have a noodle bar in our neighborhood now! I used to drive all the way to Bridgeland to get quality and now it's practically next door. This place is amazing - the service is good, atmosphere is very modern but relaxed and the food is DELICIOUS. We have now made my way through most of the menu and still cannot decide which one is the best. The flavors, presentation and speed of their service make it one of my favorite places in all of Calgary and our go-to treat for eating out these days. Prices are reasonable and you won't leave without full satisfaction."}
{"text":"Unreal. So good. Must have. Great vibe,  great music and genuine people serving awesome food. Def check it out folks.....for sure will delight your taste buds."}
{"text":"Had dinner with two girlfriends on a Wednesday at 5pm. We were the only patrons and took our time. The waitress was helpful answering our questions as it was our first time there.  We started with pork belly sliders which were ok. Nothing exciting. Tacos and nachos. Both of these were excellent! The tacos were flavourful but the nachos with crudity pie cracking, chopped pork, cheese and pico were yummy!  One if my gf's is vegetarian so they made her a sow use rice bowl with eggs, veggies and sliced mango with a side salad. My other gf had the special which included 3 skewers of tender marinated beef, garlic rice and salad. She ate only 1 skewer and brought the other 2 home. I tried a piece and would definitely order that sticky, salty, sweet beef!!!  I had the beef, dumpling and chicken noodle soup. The broth was rich and the noodles were perfect! If you enjoy noodles, trying these are a must!!!  Overall, service was attentive, the atmosphere simple and relaxed and food very tasty!  I can't wait to return and try more dishes"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves portioned foods like what fine diners do with fancy plating,  vegetable shreds, and garnishes except that it's not a fine diner.   The place looks more like a fast food restaurant the likes of Little Caesars, small Wendy's and McDonald's.  Parking is so tight. Not enough number of available space.   It's not a good place to talk or have a small informal meeting because it's noisy. It's such a small place, the noise becomes more pronounced.   The kitchen area is open to view and quite distracting. It's like watching a stage play. You can't help but watch them move around.  Takes too long for the ordered foods to arrive. Maybe three times longer than other comparable typical Asian/Filipino restaurant. Even a simple tokwa't-baboy took almost 15 minutes. Not a good thing!  On the other hand, the food taste good but more expensive than should be. Waiter and Cook were friendly."}
{"text":"this resto is a bomb!!!Foods are owesome.My boyz are so picky on foods but when we try their appetizer,noodles,n rice everything is finished.People from Calgary must try this pinoy comtemporary food, staff are so accomodating.Place is cozy, I wish we can have this in Cali."}
{"text":"Oohmami is the brain child of two great Filipino chefs.  It is a perfect fusion of new (contemporary) and old (traditional) Filipino food.  Couple this with the fact that the prices won't leave you having to take out a second mortgage it's the perfect place to go for a weekly fix.  To start we ordered the siopao pork sliders.. The meat reminded me of lechon paksiw.  The steamed bun was the perfect canvas and reminded me of a pillow of goodness in every bite.  The meat and sauce was accompanied by what I thought were pickled carrots (I could be wrong).  Whatever it was it added the perfect crunchy texture to the appetizer.  We also tried the sisig tacos with liver spread.  The liver spread gave it some nice tones and the veggies gave it a nice citrus note.  At $8 for 3 tacos it was a great deal and could be a meal on its own for some lightweights.  For those that know me, I am no lightweight and so I ordered the signature soup dish, the oohmami soup bowl.  The oohmami is comprised of house broth, roast pork slices, poached chicken, asado saunce.  It is accompanied by an open faced, semi soft poached egg and what seemed like deep fried onions.  And let's not forget the thick and chewy mami noodles.  If you are used to Vietnamese pho the mami noodles are a nice change.  They are thicker and more flavourful.  You will instantly get hooked.  In today's economy we still have many trendy restaurants charging an arm and a leg for mediocre food because they have a slick marketing campaign.  Those places will reel you in once.  Guilt sets in and you then realize you paid a huge amount of money for something you can really make at home.  Oohmami is a place that you can feel good about going back to again and again.  I will most definitely be going back again, and again, and again!"}
{"text":"Another gem of a Filipino restaurant has hit the Calgary scene. This cozy place puts a modern flair on home cooked Filipino food.   To start, I just have to say that the food was amazing. The smells from the kitchen make your mouth water. Our starters included the sisig tacos (vinegar seasoned chopped pork) and siopao sliders (steamed bun sandwiching pork belly). Both were scrumptious and left you longing for more. The mains were just as flavourful. The waygu beef brisket was so tender in the mami soup broth. The flavour of garlic permeated the dish as it should and left a warm fuzzy feeling in the belly, the kind you get when you eat food that was lovingly prepared. The tipsy tapsi was also delicious. The meat tender, flavour strong and satisfying. The dish reminds you of home having a fried egg to eat with the meat on top of rice.   Delicious food waits for you here. If you haven't had Filipino food before, I'm sure the chef can win you over."}
{"text":"We went there by casualty ... the food was not bad, some dishes were delicious, some dishes were not very good, but in average the food was ok. My recommendation would be to ask the waiters what they recommend.... and go for it, don't try dishes you just see in the menu as you may have a surprise with a different kind of food .... the service was excellent!! For me that was the best of the restaurant. The owner stopped by and was really nice with the whole group... The prices very reasonable ...."}
{"text":"This place puts out great food. I had the sisig tacos with the Mama Mia - super delicious. Staff were nice and courteous. Would recommend!"}
