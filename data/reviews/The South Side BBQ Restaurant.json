{"text":"After hearing the good rumors about the South Side BBQ food truck we decided to check out the restaurant for diner last Friday.  It was a small but very sufficient menu if you are after BBQ.  We ordered the Pulled Pork nachos.  It was a small serving compared to other restaurants size nachos.  This didn't matter much after we got our main course.  I ordered a full rack of ribs with sides of mac and cornbread.  The ribs were very meaty and just outstanding.  They was so big I planned on eating the whole rack but had to take half home.  The mac was ok but the cornbread was just outstanding.  It was a huge southern style dense piece of cornbread.  So good I got one to go home with my ribs that I couldn't eat.  My husband got the rib, pork, and chicken combo with a double side of mac.  He loved it but I doubt it was better than my ribs.  The prices were reasonable for BBQ.  I look forward to going back but I don't think I could ever order anything different than the ribs....they were that good!  Plus I got two dinners out of it :-)"}
{"text":"Small bar like atmosphere, only a few tables.  The bbq was average, I liked the pulled chicken, but thought the brisket tasted a bit like roast beef!  The cornbread was the best I've ever had, sweet with a little dollop of yummy butter on top, definitely my favorite part of the meal. The coleslaw was nothing but a pile of shredded cabbage, I didn't taste any vinegar, sugar or any seasoning at all!  The macaroni and cheese was smooth and creamy, with large noodles, too much like Kraft for me.  
My biggest gripe about this place is the price, the entrées include just meat period. Each side is extra, so an entree with 2 sides is 16-22$. Plus drink and tip is over 50$ with tip for 2 IF you're not drinking any alcohol!  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Ok bbq... food was cold. I had the bbq chicken pulled, brisket, grilled sweet potatoes and sweet corn bread. Meats were cold. Very polite staff tho."}
{"text":"Ghost pepper mac and cheese is da bomb. Ribs are good, sauce is real good. Cornbread is worth a try."}
{"text":"Best ribs in Pittsburgh! Friendly staff, old school vibe in the restaurant. The kind of spot that you don't mind hunkering down in for a few beers. Jalapeño cornbread is also great."}
{"text":"The restaurant is good, but the food is just alright.  Service is great, the chef is great, the drinks are great.

I wasn't impressed with the BBQ.  It was good, but the city has Blowfish BBQ and Union Pig serving amazing BBQ.

On the other hand, the chili they offered during the Soup Contest was amazing.  Maybe it was an off day when I was there?"}
{"text":"We ordered this for delivery tonight and the food is just ok. I have yet to find barbecue on Pittsburgh that is really good. I had the pork barbecue sandwich and it was soggy. My partner had the ribs which were decent. The pepper jack Mac and cheese was decent. Not sure I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Brought the family to try the BBQ.  We got ribs, pulled pork, chicken, and brisket.  We loved it all and I thought the ribs were awesome.  It is only one block off Carson."}
{"text":"Love this place.

Food is what makes it awesome -- it's hard to beat ribs and ghost pepper macaroni and cheese! There are three flavors of barbecue sauce, \"Carolina,\" \"hot\" and \"not.\" I recommend any of them. I enjoy them all, though I am partial to spicy (hence the ghost pepper macaroni and cheese.)

Staff is super nice and accommodating. 

If I don't get takeout, I prefer to sit at the bar and watch sports."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try ss bbq for sometime. Hoping to get a quality bbq establishment closer to my neighborhood. 

Unfortunately my wait will continue. I stopped here one late afternoon, no a soul in the establishment, except bartender (possibly manager or owner as well). As there was paperwork scatter all over the bar top. Made me feel like I was interrupting. 

Anyway, on to the food. In which I ordered takeout. The carnivore platter, cole slaw, and Mac n cheese. My grand total $29.& change. 

Coleslaw is vinegar base, which I was very very excited to try, however it fell really short of enjoyable. Pretty much just cabbage (Napa & red), carrots, white vinegar and a tad bit if any sugar. Seasoning was something that was truly lacking. 

Mac n cheese. As if Kraft substituted cheddar powder for pepper jack powder. Below average

On to the meat. Supposedly 3oz of pulled pork, quarter rack of ribs, and 3oz of brisket for $21. This was not even close to being worth it. The brisket was as if the local deli of yesteryear sliced me some flavorless brisket. The pulled pork was just ok. However the ribs were fantastic!!!!! I couldn't understand of the ribs were so tasty, but yet the brisket and pork were so underwhelming. It could be that the ribs the best looking DUFF. I'm not quite sure, but the picture can describe it."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh and barbecue are two words that do not seem sensible. Some restaurants try it and it is either lacking in flavor or overdone.  When I'm looking for barbecue, I'm not going to Texas Roadhouse but I'm also not going to Union Pig and Chicken (no offense to lovers of either establishment). I feel like barbecue needs to be unpretentious but done right. The South Side BBQ Restaurant gives me exactly what I want. 

I ordered the pulled pork meal with ghost pepper mac n' cheese and my boyfriend ordered ribs. We were given a plethora of sauces to try which was amazing because I can never have too much sauce on anything I eat ever. The portion of pork was huge and the ghost pepper mac had a balanced amount of cheese and heat. It took all of my strength in the world to not eat all of it in one sitting. The sauces were all tasty but the Carolina style was by favorite. I'm more of a Kansas City-style sauce lover so I was really surprised but it was had the perfect amount of vinegar and pepper. My boyfriend's ribs were huge and he loved them which is impressive for a southern gentleman eating ribs in Pittsburgh.

I also really loved the look of the restaurant. It was really unassuming and cozy.We actually just sat at the bar. I was kind of sad that there weren't more people there but hopefully everyone will read this and dive in! It is worth it!"}
{"text":"I just went to Southside barbecue on 17th street. There was a $6 off coupon (buy one item get one item) in the enjoy book so we figured we would try it out for an inexpensive lunch. We went in and My husband wanted the pulled pork entree and i ordered the 1/2 of bbq chicken (I specifically asked if there was ANY spice on the chicken and I was told NO). There were no sides with the entrees and they offered a \"family platter\" that consisted of most of their sides for $13. We decided we wanted to try the food and we could have leftovers for tonight.  The \"family platter\" came out and most of the food was burnt. It consisted of very small servings and wasn't worth the $13.  The entrees came out and the pulled pork (that wasn't cheap) was very small portion and it was dried meat with a squirt of bbq sauce on it. My 1/2 of chicken came out (looking like 1/2 of a Cornish hen) and was VERY spicy!!!!!!!  I asked the waiter to replace the chicken for a hamburger. The burger was great. Then we received the check. They charged me for the chicken even though the burger was cheaper. I told the waiter and he said since nothing was wrong with the chicken I was getting charged for that and they gave me the burger as a courtesy. I told him that was unacceptable and then he went and got who appeared to be the owner. At this point my husband was ready to blow a gasket so I asked him to allow me to talk to the owner. The owner reintegrated what the waiter said. I explained that I was told there was no spice on the chicken so there was something wrong with my chicken. He argued for a few minutes but in the end took off the chicken and charged us for the burger. He did this very rudely and said that he needs to make money and you don't get something for nothing. He then pointed out that we had a coupon. He said the coupon was $6 off when you bought two entrees. The waiter told him the coupon states two items. This only made the owner angrier because he had to honor his coupon. After this was all done and we paid our bill we overheard him tell other customers that everybody wants a discount (I'm sure he was in reference to us). We will not go back again because of our experience. Customer service is key to owning a restaurant. There's a way to and not to talk to a customer and he was a prime example of how NOT to treat a customer."}
{"text":"LOVEEEEE THIS PLACE!!! It's a southside secret since it's a little off Carson but definitely worth going to. The BARBACONE is incredible. Mac n cheese pulled pork and coleslaw all in a waffle cone. Many times I've gone the place has been pretty quiet but only because no one knows about it!! Everyone has seen the food truck but we gotta spread the word about the restaurant! Definitely go try it!!"}
{"text":"Sad experience for me. Got a brisket sandwich which was dry as a bone, no sauce at all either. Mac and cheese was 3 bucks for about a half a cup of it. I'll try the ribs next time but I honestly have to say the cost of what you get is horrible. I'm a brisket fan and can honestly say the giant eagle at settlers ridge puts this to shame and that's not a joke."}
