{"text":"Let's just say this, if you are white trash, you will love this place.  You truly will fit in perfectly, since that is all that frequents this fine establishment.  Their food is not fit for humans, their service is very sub par, their clientelle is, as I've already stated, rather Apache Junction-like and the atmosphere is just depressing.  So come on down and make sure to wear your finest Metal Mullisha T-shirt and bring multiple packs of cigarettes to enjoy on their smoke filled patio, with the rest of the toothless patrons."}
{"text":"Christiana is an awesome barkeep.  She is quick to respond to you and very pleasant in taking your order.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Wife had a great mushroom swiss burger. I had taco salad with chicken minus shell - tasty."}
{"text":"I asked them to make me a one off special drink and they did.... a hot dog water sluchie"}
{"text":"I had teriyaki wings...sauce very salty.  Hubby had steak burrito with green sauce - sauce had way too much flour cause that was all you could taste.  Service OK.  Probably won't go back.  My favorite wing place closed :("}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere at this bar! The food is great, along with the employees! Their chicken is great. Dan the bartender is a known local and remembers you as one, he is so friendly! Everyone that comes here has a great time!"}
{"text":"This place blows!!! Rated the best wings ?? I don't think so! They were terrible. Also, the service was bad and it wasn't even busy. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Food is good and service is ok on weekends. But during the week, service is horrible! Bartenders and bar servers don't communicate and the customer ends up thirsty. Not just 1 time but time and time again. And they act let they don't care."}
{"text":"This place has the most unbelievable meatloaf. I found this the other day tucked away. The staff are friendly the owner is gregarious and the food and menu are absolutely superb.  Remember, this is a sports bar not a place for intimate dining. There are TVs all over the place to watch every imaginable sport. I give it an A plus."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, I discovered this place with an old friend looking for Famous Sam's to gather for a few drinks and some food near my office on Power Road. Here's the deal. I am a meticulously picky health food type of guy---and they scored at least a triple on that count! If you care about delicious burgers W/O the red meat going directly to your waisteline you have to try their Bison Burgers! Bison burgers are lower in fat and cholesterol  than even chicken and turkey. Check on it. And these guys easily have the best Bison burgers in Mesa. Or even the valley. They are so low in the \"grease\" that I order them medium rare for flavor. With cheese! I order a big glass of tomato juice w/lemon, and they steam whatever vegeetables they have (squash and zuchini tonight, usually carrots or string beans) inplace of fries. They also have soup to start, but if it's not healthful, I order a cup of their pretty decent chili instead, W/O onions. After polishing off a healthful dinner like that, I don't mind imbibing in a few drinks afterward. I'd give it 5 stars, but their wait staff is often uneven, but usually caring. And I'd love it if they'd upgrade their soup menu to more traditional things. The last two times that I've been there, their \"soup of the day\" was \"hamburger soup,\" whatever that is, instead of chicken noodle, or something else with good broth and some veggies in it. But overall, I really like the place for its wide assortment of food, comfortable atmosphere, lots of sports screens all over the place, as well as its full bar selection. Cheers to these guys! And their prices are VERY resonable, even for a \"picky eater.\""}
{"text":"Another one bites the dust. I loved JJ's for the all you can eat fish, wings, an burgers.  We went in last night to be told that they had changed the menu again. Ok- they have come up with some really great stuff in the past- but on reading through the prices have really gone through the roof- 10$ for a cheese burger with fries? 12 $ for a salad? 8$ for 5 wings ? The all you can eat fish fry is gone .... Also the bar situation is stupid at best - people seat in the chair and go to the  patio to smoke leave the chair tipped in - and some are gone 30-45 min. On the last visit about 3 wks ago I noticed the burger was smaller and the fries where fewer.  Will look for a new place to hang out"}
{"text":"The times my wife and I have been here were fun. The food is ok. Truth is, you come here for the cold giant beers and football."}
{"text":"You know the place that you live near and every time you drive by its fairly busy and on Fridays and Saturdays its really busy....then all of a sudden its CLOSED?   Yeah this place at some point is going to be that place.  Friday Fish fry is really good, set up and location are great......Management and Servers are HORRIBLE!!   Do the owners have blinders on or what??  They must live out of state!!   This would be perfect place for a service manager or management of another company to send training employees on what NOT TO DO!!"}
{"text":"Woop woop!! Great place, great beer, great specials, great time. I've been here dozens of times and never had a problem. Wings are pretty good but their potato skins are a great deal and they come out QUICK. servers are always super friendly and the beer is ice cold... need I say more??"}
{"text":"Usually very good.  Tonight, not so good!  We had the all you can eat fish dinner.  Fish was not cooked enough, grey translucent inside.  Usually very white fish when it is served. We had to ask for my salad and my husband's clam chowder AFTER our meal came out.  These are supposed to come out before the dinner.  I was given the wrong salad dressing.  Waitress was good but we were disappointed in the meal."}
{"text":"The food is okay but over-priced.  I was astonished to pay 9 dollars for an appetizer that literally had only 4 bites of food.  My salad was something I could have had for less somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from where I live so thought I would stop by to check it out because they advertised $2 Dos Equis today. Ordered the green chile burger. Worst burger I think I ever ate. No flavor at all. Some type of flavorless green paste on it. It reeked of stale smoke even though it was non smoking. The only thing good about it was the beer. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Wow not sure about all the negative reviews. Got the all you can eat fish. Only a buck more than the two piece but worth it pieces on the small side but lightly breaded and really good. Well worth the extra buck second helping was three more fish and just as hot and good as the first. Service was excellent and the cold Slaw was to die for. This place was great and will be back"}
{"text":"Okay, where do I start.  The food at JJ Madisons is okay.  Not great, not bad.  Not something I would drive out of my for but still not bad.  Now for the service.  ABSOLUTELY horrible, probably the worst I've experienced in quite some time.  They have a seat yourself policy but there is no one who keeps a lookout for new customers coming in.  We have sat for at least 10 minutes on several occasions before someone even noticed that we were there.  Very unprofessional.  We have even gone up to the servers and mentioned that we are there and have been told that someone will be with us shortly.  Really?  I don't think so.  We saw two people recently wait so long to be waited on that they just walked out.  We were on the verge of doing the same thing because our order was taking so long but they delivered it just in time.  Also, it doesn't matter whether the place is crowded or you're the only customers in the place.  We've been there in the summer and the service still sucks.  They'll just keep walking by you as if you were invisible.    It also seems that everyone of their servers has an attitude problem.  They make you feel like they are doing you a favor by waiting on you.  Extremely rude people. Not just one server but all.  A universal problem. Do they find they these people all in the same place?   Part of the logistical problem is that the servers always have their backs to the restaurant because the registers are facing the wall.  Maybe if they somehow could turn them 180 degrees so the servers faced the restaurant, they might be a little more cognizant of new visitors entering the dining room.  Probably still wouldn't prevent the stuck up attitude but at least it's a start.  After our 4th time there and been treated the same way, we will definitely not be going back or referring the place to our friends.  Their nine lives are over."}
{"text":"Good is delicious and super reasonable on prices! It's a sports bar, the booths are comfortable. I think at one point smoking used to be allowed in there so there is that faint smell of cigar smoke but it's not really strong. Once you taste the food you forget all about it! The staff is sweet and courteous. Sometimes can be a little slow but again after you taste the food you forget about it! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Our waitress Summer was GREAT!!! Be sure to ask for her. We ordered off menu and Summer made sure we got it. She didn't hover, but was right there when we were ready to check out.  The chicken fried steak was a good size with white gravy a plenty. Baked potato was good. Green beans a bit overcooked but buttery which worked for me. Treat yourself with dinner here. I'm from great Grand Prairie, TX so I'm so glad we came here for our last lunch before going back home."}
{"text":"JJ Madison's is out for my own heart. It's hard to come across a bar that has EVERYTHING I wish for, right out of the gate. For me, those must-haves are: 1) A discount night on hot-wings 2) A Golden Tee machine 3) Buzz Time 4) Any strong IPA (India Pale Ale) whether on tap or in a bottle.  JJ Madison's has all of those things and more.  They also have a decent collection of HDTV's that feature sports and music videos, a mini shuffleboard, a classic \"Rampage\" arcade, and a pool table.  Their menu is filled with great food.  I have never had anything mediocre there, which is pleasantly surprising for a bar.  One of my favorite things is that they sell Vegas-sized, 32-ounce beers for only about $5.  That's right, want a fresh stein of \"Hop-Shock\" from the local San Tan brewery?  On tap.  Four Peaks?  On tap.  New Belgium?  On tap.  Guinness?  Of course! They also have Budweiser and-the-like for all you wussies out there without sophisticated taste (buds).  I try to frequent JJ Madison's every Monday night for their 39¢ wings. If you want to try out a new place, but don't have a lot of cash, give it a shot then!  You can wind up with a full belly and a very buzzed brain for under $10. Then, if you're too buzzed to drive, JJ Madison's not only offers free rides home, they'll pick you up, too!   If you'd prefer to not leave your car in their parking lot overnight, they'll even do that in reverse order.  They'll pick you up at your house to take you to JJ Madison's. then bring you home when you're done partying!  Wild, fun, AND responsible!  Now THAT's a cool bar!  All in all, I'm certain my review makes this place sound like a dive-bar, but I want to ensure you it's nothing of the sort.  It's clean, friendly, comfortable, fun, and even kid-friendly during the day. I love this place.  :-)"}
{"text":"We tried to eat here last night. The smoking patio is right at the front door and it was very full. I'm not sure why they have a separate smoking section outside because the cigarette smoke was so strong on the inside we might as well have been sitting out with them. ( I am a former smoker so I am a little sensitive to the smell)   It is a seat yourself kind of place and last night it was pretty crowded. We found a booth as far away from the patio as we could. We sat there and waited... and waited.... and waited. When we finally saw a server she sighed loudly and rolled her eyes at our table. She kept walking and didnt bother to say anything to us.  We got up and left.   Maybe it was just an off night for the staff but what a horrible 1st impression."}
{"text":"This is the best barbecue in town a must try five stars. I have to pay compliments to the chef, in a state full of BBQ it's a feather in your cap to be so awesome."}
{"text":"JJ Madisons is the perfect spot to sit back and indulge, they also have an awesome patio misting system, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Bring patience as service is slow. Have to ask a couple of times for refills on drinks, even water. Menu consist of heavy comfort foods. I've had the fish tacos, not so good. Last night I ordered the wings. The chicken skin was pale and mushy, gross. Nothing on the menu addresses any allergies , nothing gluten free. Need to get with the times on that issue. Not recommended. Very seldom to we not leave a tip but last night we didn't. Friday night between 5:30 and 7:30 with lots of open tables."}
{"text":"Not good at all. Service was very slow and food was barely edible. Only 2 waitresses in the place.  Waited for menus, waited to place our order, waited to get served (almost 40 minutes), waited to get the bill.  Finally gave up and left cash on the table and walked out.  Wish we had walked out before we ever ordered.  We wouldn't go back if the food was free."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now, this place is  just a local tavern with fair pub food.  It's a convenient area for me to meet some friends and get \"a free ride\" so for once, I can drink some beer if I take myself out.  For a neighborhood place, WHY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE so UNFRIENDLY?     The big guy \"Dee\" I think his name is, he is the worst and continuously THE most rude. I asked him a question about their loyalty program and he was rolling his eyes.  I waited at the bar 10 more minutes before he asked if I wanted anything to drink.   My friends came in and we were lucky with a cramped table, we had to fix the table from rocking because it was really rickety.  Well, we ordered some wings ,and the first order of wings was good, but the second order of wings didn't even come close!  Inconsistent food for sure there.  The waitress had to be flagged down and the service, well, we gave up.  Oh, and we missed the FIRST Arizona Cardinals TOUCHDOWN because they didn't even have the GAME ON.  Just before the 2pm game time, we were like, there isn't one TV clued into the Cards game and everyone was too scared to ask the rude bartender with an attitude  to turn on the ARIZONA Cards game.   I mean we are in ARIZONA?  Final thing, word to the wise:: DO not believe their \"free ride\" service advertising.  If you call that number you will get a cranky, dour man who acts like he is doing you a favor to pick you up. He drives a really  dirty, smoke-infested cab. Yuck.   Well,we  left and took our party to our friends house.  This place it not worth it to hang out anymore. My last dollar was spent there yesterday 11/24/13. I'm done."}
{"text":"Could be a good bar if the staff wasnt worthless. I have been in there 3 times. They need to fire the chubby girl with brown hair. She is just lazy. It took 15 minutes to get a drink one time so I just walked out...there was 6 people at the bar. It amazes me that when a customer walks in the door she goes out to smoke then starts washing dishes when she returns"}
{"text":"Love coming to jjs on fridays for maddhatter karaoke wish maddhatter did karaoke on Saturdays at jjs too"}
{"text":"We have Driven past this  joint 10,000 times over the past few years and never given it a second thought.   Ryan was having a new stereo system put in our daughter's car at the radio place a block away & he walked here to wait for them to finish installing it.  He called me and asked if I wanted to meet him \"down there\" for lunch, I said sure, I was sorta tired of watching the \"Who the bleep did I Marry\" marathon anyway.    I want to make something clear; THIS IS A BAR! A JOINT! A hangout of sorts.   Let's be realistic and call it like it is. I don't like it when people review places going into it with the wrong prospective or expectation  and rating it as you would a five star dining experience. IT IS A BAR!   I walked in, found my honey sitting between the 42 year old high school drop out and,  I am pretty sure the guy I just saw featured on \"Who the bleep did I marry\" a few minutes ago. Buuuuttttt. Anywho....  I sat at the bar and hung my brand new leather CHLOE bag on the convenient hook located just under the bar top.   I sat down all ready to be pissed from reading the reviews. But again, I realize I am in a BAR, so I have no expectations.    The diet coke was really good!   The felon (beside me) and his tatted up friend ( is tatted spelled right) like he had a lot of tattoos, isn't that what you called \"tatted???\" ANYWAY, they had just gotten their food when I sat  down.    One guy had a rueben which looked pretty darn good with crispy rye bread and extra thousand island with waffle fries, his friend  had a 12\" hot dog smothered in chili and cheese.  When the bartender placed it in front of him, the tatted guy yells \"holy shit\" and, after seeing it with my own two eyes, that was a spot on analogy! It was huge and it cost $3.99!! It came with fries too. I believe it was called the home wrecker or the hijacker, something like that. Felon guy made a great comment about \"wrecking his toilet\" later and giggled as he began to dig in.  I looked over the menu forever! It has a fun concept referring  to most food items in categories titled for cities and streets in Chicago.   The bartender came over and asked what we wanted. I told him I really didn't want to eat anything fattening and greasy. Realizing I sounded snooty after I said that,   he very nicely recommended a Chicken breast topped with Swiss and avocado. Then he said \"instead of fries, we can do a dinner salad.\"  I said \"PERFECT!!\"  Ryan ordered a personal pizza. I don't even know what kind.   I also ordered fried pickles, cause I tend to like fried pickles. :)   The bartender kept my diet coke fresh the whole time. That is huge extra bonus points when a waitstaff person does that for me!   The food was really good.  Let's Remember,  IT IS BAR FOOD!!   The dinner salad was good. I took a picture for you. I also took a picture of Ryan's pizza, my sandwich, my Fried pickles and a friend who met us there ordered chicken fingers. They were HUGE!!!  I took a picture of those as well.  The young, pregnant barback was really sweet and was working really hard the whole time we were there that I observed. The bar was packed as was the outdoor patio.   I did smell a little bit of smoke coming from the patio outside, but (say it with me) IT IS A BAR!   There are awesome Tv's everywhere. It would be a fantastic place to go and watch any sports game that was on or you could play a little pool too.   They have happy hour everyday from 11-7pm. The size of the beers were rediculous. They also have a \"free ride home\" service which I was pretty impressed by.   I don't drink beer, but if you do, you will be happy here.  I saw a few hard ass looking motorcycle guys, a lesbian in a tank top and cut offs, a few families with small children, young, blue collar guys enjoying a day away from the naggin wives, several husband and wife enjoying a beautiful Sunday, and just regular ole everyday people like myself.   If you just throw all of your  expectations out the window when you go here, you might be pleasantly surprised by the warm, neighborhood hangout kinda vibe it has.   Every staff member was very pleasant and all of the patrons were nice as well. When our friend came in to join us at the packed bar, the lone man sitting next to me actually got up and offered him his chair.   The bartender was very pleasant and made a nice lunch suggestion for me, he kept our drinks full, he made conversation and joked with all of the patrons.  Even though the bar was full, he didn't ignore anyone that I saw.   I would go back here for sure. And BELIEVE ME WHEN I say; I have high expectations when I eat out, shop, whatever, but I am also a realist and realize some places are supposed to be a certain way. Like a BAR. There is definitely a specific vibe in here and it is what makes this place  fun and sets it apart. :)   We will go back and maybe make a few friends next time we are there. After all, it would be intriguing to have a friend on parole ."}
{"text":"The drinks are amazing!  Love the cheese curds!  I've been a regular here for over 10 years and have met some pretty amazing people and had some pretty amazing times! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat the service the prices the quantity are all great but I want to address the pig roast on Saturday afternoons. It is also very good and it's all you can eat but if you go in there expecting to see a pig being carved up that won't happen. What they have is a chef serving you what to me appears to be pulled pork, there is no skin or legs or anything that is really the succulent parts of a pig. When I asked the chef where the skin and bones were he told me some woman buys all that stuff every week so I was left eating plain pulled pork."}
{"text":"Walked into the Mesa location this evening. Sign at the door said to \"seat yourself\" so we did. We sat at a very broken down booth for well over 5 minutes and  neither of the two waitresses acknowledged our presence. After another 2-3 minutes one waitresses walked by slamming menus on the tables and again not a word was spoken....really?? The other waitress came over and asked if we wanted a drink. At that point I was done and starving. We walked out and went to Chilis...at least they're friendly and want to make money. Smh....I will never go back to this location! EVER!!"}
{"text":"The only thing worse than the service was the food!!! Took over an hour to get food we had to send back because the rib tips come with the bone being more tender than the meat and the meat on the Beef Strogenoff was raw in the middle. Brought to the attention of the dining room manager who did not even apologize, just said sometimes things don't go right in the kitchen. Needless to say we will not be back!"}
{"text":"Bartenders are rude to women. And the girl that runs off track betting is too busy on her cell phone"}
{"text":"Fast bartenders who work hard. Good tv's. Food is not bad either. Some great stuff, it's bar food but not bad for your typical choices."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always great food, great drinks, great atmosphere. Ignore the reviews that are not so complimentary. We always have a great time. Tammy is an awesome bartender and Mikey is a great cook. Give it a try. If u don't like the servers, tell them and they will fix it!!"}
{"text":"First visit July 2016. We had fish and chips and their 4-piece chicken, visited during lunchtime, sat in the bar area.  Service was good, we left a good sized tip. The food was tasty, served hot. All in all a good first experience. I'm certain more trips here will follow and we'll also use carry-out.  The menu is large, I suggest you research it online before going.   It appears like they do off track betting in this place. At lunch time they had multiple TV sets with races at various horserace tracks."}
{"text":"This place is always a favorite. we took my mom here for her birthday, since she is so picky, we knew JJ Madisons' would have something for her on their menu. Great variety! Whether it be chops, burgers or wings, pasta or fish, it is all delicious. Amazing prices! also the many TVs have something for everyone."}
{"text":"Absolutely  the worst ever ..not our waitresses  fault...we waited over an hour for our mael..no excuse ..wings really??? Never will our group come here sgain..too many other good places near here.."}
{"text":"Went out for supper, ordered the chicken special.  It took over thirty minutes, one piece was good, the second was cooked too long, dry and had a burned taste.  My wife's French fries were cold.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Strong drinks = one star Great wings = one star Great service = one star Free shuffleboard = one star  Great neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"Went in and told Linda she should check out the reviews here...she said she hadn't. I assumed she would but you know about assume. She asked who it was and I told her to read the review and figure it out. She guessed another bar tender so I guess there might be more than just one. Bar Rescue would have refused if asked to help this place....need I say more?"}
{"text":"We have eaten a number of time at this place and always had good food. We have enjoyed the rib basket and schrimp basket. Today was different , I ordered the \"broasted chicken\" , and my wife ordered the rib basket. The food came and I should have sent it back right away. The chicken was not golden brown like 99% of the other \"broasted chicken\" I've eaten , it was white and dripping with grease. The ribs were nothing like we remembered them...they were dry and lacked any sauce. When our server asked us how was our food, I said, not very good, and told her what the issue was, she replied , do you know what broasted chicken is ? I didn't need the attitude at this point, with a little politeness I might have given them another chance but with the number of untried eaterys in the Mesa area, I think not. Goodbye JJ Madison's."}
{"text":"Just came back from supper for 2. Service was great, food was great, and prices reasonable Met all expectations We will be back"}
{"text":"Entertaining bar & grill with several TV's for the sports enthusiast. We walked in & seated ourselves & were greeted promptly. We ordered a couple draft beers (one being a massive 32 oz) for a good price. They have a ton of food on the menu but our group stuck to the apps: cheese curds, nachos, blooming onion, & $0.69 wings cause it was a Thursday. They all came out great! We stayed for Bingo Trivia which I remember being more fun in the past but still worth it, played some pool, & sang karaoke. Great night with great food, beer, & service!"}
{"text":"I will sum it up in one word-BAD!  I ordered cod, fries and cole slaw to go.  After I picked up my order, I checked the bag and they had forgotten the cole slaw I paid for.  I had to go back in.The fried cod had a fried batter that had become soggy on the 5 minute trip home.  I had to discard that and they only provided about a tablespoon of tartar sauce that was not enough. Fries were warm, not hot. They did not provide ketchup or salt.  First and last time for this smokey establishment."}
{"text":"We loved eating at this restaurant, great broasted chicken, but things changed. They had a point system, which was nice. After you accrued so many points you could cash in to help pay for your meal. Unfortunately for customers all those points were lost. We went there last night and intended to share a meal. We don't eat that much and have done this in the past. We were told they no longer allowed this. I told the waitress ok, just bring me a side salad and I will have a bite of my husbands chicken. She said she would get into trouble and we would not be allowed back. So I said could I just get one piece of chicken and a salad. The cook said he would do it this one time, but not again, charged us $4 for a chicken breast that used to be $2This place is not a customer friendly place and as much as we like the chicken, we will not be going back any time soon. Too bad we were very good customers.      In response to the owner David M (whom I never met)--- I am surprised you don't care about retaining a customer, when clearly we have so many other dining options. You not only lost our business but we also have many friends we share dining experiences with, kiss them goodbye also.  As far as your costs are concerned that is the cost of doing business. Retaining good customers should be first and foremost to help with those costs.  We always paid in cash and to point out a lie on your part, points were not in my name. So how could you delete them? All points were lost by all your customers due to a new system you have. People are not happy about this at all! I have talked to many.  We alway spent upwards of $50 per visit (we also had adult beverages) and tip.  So good bye and good luck to you, you are the one needs it!"}
{"text":"Philly was dry.  Chilling just tasted bad.  Pulled pork even taste like fast food.  Been in the area for 1 month, and the only bad meal so far.  (At least the waiter was nice.). Keep driving."}
{"text":"They have the best cod loins, clam chowder, boasted chicken around. Other things I have tried are okay- onion rings, steak fries, Cole slaw. I have not tried the hamburgers yet but they look good."}
{"text":"Good dive bar.  I am always the youngest person there by a few decades, but that's ok, folks are friendly.  Good, free poker night on Sunday.  Beer is cold, wings are big and tasty.  Pizza was undercooked, but there's really no such thing as bad pizza so I ate it anyway.  Burgers are huge! Able to get a good table for football games, not really crowded."}
{"text":"This is a good neighborhood place to grab a few brews and some grub. Don't expect gourmet food (not sure why anyone would at a sports bar) but the food is definitely tasty and given in large portions. For the best service sit at the bar, the servers can be a little slow sometimes but the bartenders are on point.  They have off-track betting here also, as well as pool tables and lots of TVs with any sports game you could want to watch.  Usually they have live music a couple nights a week also, and a decent patio."}
{"text":"The staff is phenomenal! The wings are great!!! And the place is chill! U can definitely have a great time here! Check it out!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The fish Friday's are my weakness. I always find the staff super friendly and accommodating and the fish is great. I have also been for happy hour with friends. I haven't ever been on the bar side, always in the dining area, but JJ''s is my \"go-to\" when I feel like splurging, and I have never been disappointed. The rest of my family has enjoyed other menu options, I always get the fish :) The free ride home is also nice and I have used it once and was very pleased that they offered this responsible way to go out and have a good time with no worries. I don't get out much, but JJ's suits me fine :)"}
{"text":"Omg this is our new girls night out spot on Tuesdays. They have karaoke, free ride no DUI service, $2 dos and coronas! extremely nice staff and hands down the best wings we have ever had! Thank you for being awesome! Actually about to head there now to try out wing night!"}
{"text":"Lots of TV, good music and yummy food.  The prices are right on too."}
{"text":"As of 2/5/2017 No longer have the senior Broadsted Chicken price. Because the door opens up from the smoking patio it makes half the bar smell of smoke. Broasted chicken is the best."}
{"text":"i went here for lunch last week,after reviewing the menu i decided on the meatloaf sandwich may be i didnt read the discription but what i got was a open face sandwich the piece of loaf wasnt big enough to cover the bread and was a thin piece as well. the price was stiff for the portion served. beer selection fair service decent. i may return to try wings but at this point not high on my list"}
{"text":"I'm so disgusted that I plan on going there tomorrow to speak with a REAL manager. Bartender lied about being the management. Very unprofessional.  I intend on calling management tomorrow about my experience. It was inconsistent and unprofessional. I do not recommend this location. The only good this about this place is the dj and host. Announcing drink specials when not available is unacceptable. I will not come here for a reg spot, only for birthdays. Rude, short dark hair bartender. For the tip we left plus the 13 people in attendance to my friends birthday party should have been better attended to. Horrible service even though there were MULTIPLE employees in attendance. Bad birthday. Never again. Ever..."}
{"text":"This is the worst service that I have ever had period...... Beers are cold and good, ordered food almost an hour ago really, I have not even got my Salad OMG!!!! Never recommend some one to come eat for free"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch in a Saturday so I could catch the ASU football game. The place was half-empty, not crowded by any stretch of the imagination. I ordered the broasted chicken and an iced tea. First it took forever for the waitress to come to my table, and when she did she asked me for my drink order and she would be back to take my food order. It took another 10 to get my drink, and a long time to get my food. My tea glass was empty and again it took forever to get another. Same with the check and also to get my credit card swiped. Just plain horrible, uncaring, and indifferent service. And my food which I assumed was cooked to order was only lukewarm. I would choose McDonald's before I would step foot in this place again."}
{"text":"I live near this place but had never visited. One night my son and I decided to try it. We were very pleased. They have  awesome burgers and a large selection of draft beer. The menu is extensive. TV's are everywhere so it's fabulous for Sunday football. The service is friendly and competent."}
{"text":"We've had two great food experiences at this restaurant within the last year.  Highly recommend the burgers and I've heard great things about the pig roast option!  Busy but good sports bar feeling."}
{"text":"Just awful.  4 of us.  3 ordered different burgers.  None of them was what was ordered.  Carne Asada awful.  Came home hungry.  Drinks watered down and over priced.  There was a fly in one of the drinks.  Service awful.  Never again."}
{"text":"Service is just ok however the food especially the broasted chicken is the best in Mesa."}
{"text":"Big fan of their \"All Day, Everyday\" summer Happy Hour, until that ended middle of summer! Other than that, good menu, good food (especially the wraps) and ice cold beers on tap are priced right. Love the sweet potato tater tots and the fish tacos were awesome. Overall, a decent place to go for food and drinks."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years, always liked the place. However, standing at the bar for 20 minutes waiting to PAY is rather annoying.... Especially when of the bartenders is standing around. I'm writing this review as I stand here and wait!"}
{"text":"Great Broasted chicken and wonderful service. We seated ourselves and a waitress took our drink order immediately. She was very helpful and attentive. I don't understand the negative reviews. Food was great, service was great and the place was clean. I will return again for chicken and to try other tasty sounding items from their menu."}
{"text":"Dont even bother with this place,  they are awful. Over priced and the food sucks. My philly had zero flavor and the bread was so hard it hurt to bite into it. The \"dinner salad\" was basically iceberg lettuce and a piece of tomato. Disgusting. Will not be back."}
{"text":"My dad and I went to this place over the weekend and was pleasantly surprised by the warm greeting we got from their Manager Linda but that is all we can say that is any good about this place. Their female bartender needs lots of lessons on how to treat a PAYING customer which we will NEVER BE AGAIN. The food is ok if you like frozen white trash finger food crap and the servers are rude smell like cigarettes and chatty. Now we find out that they fired Linda and we heard the staff bad mouth her. BAD BUSINESS, \"DO YOUR SELF AND YOUR FRIENDS A FAVOR AND STAY AWAY , THEY SHOULD JUST CLOSE THIS PIT HOLE\""}
{"text":"Big fun, don't get me started. Enjoy the live music. Sit at the bar or in the music room.  Outdoors is also a great option."}
{"text":"A bit loud, lots of people, but food is great! I ordered the burger with swiss and avocado and crispy fries. The kettle chips are awesome, very crispy. Good service. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Only have been here during lunch time. Slow moving waitresses. The food is hit or miss. Occasional, mistakes made by cook. The Broasted Chicken is my favorite. The last few times I have been there a sewer smell over took the dining area. However, they used the mexican cleaning agent \"Fabuloso\" to try and cover the smell. I cannot stand the smell of Fabuloso. It gives me a headache. Not only that but Fabuloso has no bacteria fighting components in the formula. I won't return until they change their cleaning brand or fix the sewer."}
{"text":"Great family food establishment  They do have a outside smoking  patio for those inclined. The food Is excellent and the service for the most part is great. We love the Animal House Burgers, 2 quarter pound patties 2 slices of cheese and two pieces of bacon. The keep the table areas clean . They have plenty of TV's for those who have favorite teams they do not want to miss."}
{"text":"I came Saturday night and a good band called \"Uncorked\" was playing. There is no dance floor but you can squeeze in front of the tables and the band if you don't mind dancing on tile. Uncorked was a good dance band but nobody was dancing -- hmmm. Maybe it was the lousy accommodations for dancers or maybe most of the time their bands aren't good enough to dance to.  The draft beer selection had many craft IPAs. It would have been nice to have more variety but I'm being picky because most sports bars have far worse selections. I like that they have several sizes -- my favorite was 22 ounces.  Service is very slow.  I ordered onion rings. It took forever to get them and when I did it was a big disappointment. You might want to go slow on eating there. If a place doesn't make good onion rings their fried food is probably not good.   I would go back if  good band was playing. I'm happy E. Mesa has a place like this."}
{"text":"My hubby and I got a Groupon for this place.  I have seen it advertised in local newspapers and Val Pak coupon books so I thought they might be popular and decided to check them out.    Full disclosure, we are not sports bar people per se, but I have eaten lunch in my fair share of sports bars over the years and I have no issue with the environment and fully expected a bar food type menu of offerings.  My one-star review is because the food my husband and I had (fried zucchini & mushroom app, Car Guy burger for hubby and Patty Melt for me) was literally the WORST food we have EVER eaten.    Case in point, my husband ended up spitting out his first bite of burger because he couldn't get it down!!!  The burgers, which they are supposedly known for, were made from a nasty frozen patty that must have been either frozen for 10 years or they are using the cheapest nastiest quality of protein available (don't even want to say it was beef because we honestly were sure)!   I didn't have high expectations going in (understood it was a sports bar, understood the type of food we would find on the menu, expected the sports bar atmosphere) and despite low expectations, they still failed miserably.  Suffice to say we will never return to JJ Madison's and unless you are only going to drink I recommend staying away as well."}
{"text":"I ordered the tenderloin sandwich and pulled pork the first time. The tenderloin was so so so good ot was crazy. The tenderloin was very very large in size and very filling, and came with homemade chips. Pulled pork sandwich  was just ok, something i could have got any place and sold bbqand it was very small size. Could of paid $3 for that sandwich. The pulled pork came with chips also. I didnt care for the chips either they were hard and very browned like it was over cooked. But the tenderloin kinda made up for my first experience so i came back the 2nd time for another tenderloin sandwich. This time i got wedges with my sandwich. The tenderloin was good 2nd time around but the wedges were giant slices of kinda plain potatoes. It was like 4 wedges in my meal but very huge wedges. I think they get seasoned better when they are small. When you have very large hunks of potatoes its hard to season all that potato. Couple weeks later i ordered for a third time on uber eats and i got biscuits and gravy. I was very excited because i love biscuits and gravy and i didnt thing anyone could mess a meal like this up. It was probably close to the time when breakfast was about to end. Not sure, just a guess because they must of had biscuits they made from early morning. They put my biscuits in the microwave and heated them up to long and put gravy on top. I couldnt even eat my biscuits at all, so i just had the eggs that came with it. This was the worst disappointment ever. I was thinking of not returning to this place after this, im still not sure about it. I called and talked to someone about it. I told him my biscuits were hard and unedible, like they put them in microwave and he said that, that sounded about right. So he was saying he didnt know why they would put them in microwave but he was sure they did. He apologized and took my name down to send me out a coupon or something to get another biscuits and gravy probably. Its been a while now and i didnt get anything in mail. I called a couple days ago to see if they even sent anything out. Some places will just take your name and tell you anything just to get you off the phone. I talk to a female and she said she didnt know what the guy would have written it on and she could take my name down and check on it. I still haven't heard from anyone yet. So im not sure if they care or not. I do know that before i go back to this place or tell anyone else about it it will be a long while. I will have to have good experience from then on out. And they have to take responsibility for giving people food that is below average. Because i went to this place based off of many good reviews. I didnt want to give any bad reviews to this place because i. Thought this was going to be my new goto spot. Until this biscuits and gravy meal."}
{"text":"We placed a large order of a variety of wings for pickup.  The wings and service we're awesome.  The owner even called to see how everything was!  Great place, will definitely be ordering again soon!"}
{"text":"Hard to believe, but the absolute worst dining experience I can ever remember.  My family came for the fish fry.  We were seated (in a half empty) dining room for 35 minutes while we watched waitresses mill around the dining room filling napkin holders. No drinks no menu no greeting.  I finally got fed up and asked the host what I needed to do to get a server.  At that point I could see a \"meeting of the minds\" occurred in a back corner of the dining room.  One of the waitresses came up and made a snarky comment about how evidently we must have been forgotten, but she wouldn't forget about us.  The food was lackluster at best.  Our 1st plate of fish was barely warm and soggy on the bottom (I think it had been sitting for a while).  They brought another plate of fish which was fresh and hot, but still just mediocre.  Bottom line VERY disappointing"}
{"text":"Went in today with my girlfriend and the sign said restaurant was closed for cleaning and seat yourself at the bar, ok fine. Sat ourselves and noticed 4 waitresses siting in a booth playing on their phone and yes they looked at us and said nothing and another two other waitresses walking around, well after they looked at us a couple times more and 15 mins going by and no service we finally decide to walk out, as soon the waitress with the short short hair saw we were walking then and only then she tried to make a effort!! No Thanks!!  Never going back! Thank god I spent no money! Just wasted time!!"}
{"text":"Food is good service polite but slow and sometimes forgetful. My family has dined here twice. Keep going back for food but don't go if you are in a hurry. I'd go back haven't had a bad meal yet. If the service picks up will rate as a 4 star"}
{"text":"This place is very good....consisent burgers, pastrami and service.  BUT..the signs state ALL SUMMER...specials.. for example Mondays 2 for 1 burgers, Happy Hour all day till 7pm etc.  So, to our excitement-it's MEMORIAL DAY/MONDAY and they do not honor the special on their  brightly painted windows until June 1st.  We were told sorry...you have to wait until next week.  Nowhere, on the signs does it say 6/1.  OK people...does Memorial Day not kick off summer or what?  June 1st is not summer ...but June 21st is?????  Just saying...  I am surprise they wouldn't honor all their summer specials on their window displays of all days....MEMORIAL DAY.......I would suggest to call in prior..to see if they honor their specials they are \"advertising\", what day it starts.  The food is good.  The service is good.  Just saying...."}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant a good review last time I visited and was frankly shocked by other unfavorable reviews. Today, I understand.    Tonight was the World Series game 6. The place was pretty busy but there were four open seats at the end of the bar and two more down on the end. We took two of the four and an immediate wave of rotten trash smell wafted up my nose.  We sat for a few more minutes until the second rotten trash smell drove us down to the two seats at the end.    Probably should have left then-- But, I really wanted to watch the game.  Getting a drInk? Super slow  service, a grumpy waitress who told off the guy next to us-- he just asked for a refill.   Bad start.   We ordered- one mixed drink one beer. Two French dip sandwiches.  20 minutes later our sandwiches arrived. They looked good!  Unfortunately, what was inside was the driest most flavorless meat ever. Even soaked in au jus, this was some nasty, dry, old meat.   Ok, I was here to watch the game. .  I had another beer. All was well.  I told the waitress I was done and put my credit card down. She took our plates and disappeared for 15 minutes.  Literally no one behind the bar on a busy night for 15 minutes?    Finally another employee called her back, she walked right past us and started chit chatting with someone else across the bar.  5 minutes later we get out bill.  Charged an extra drink we didn't order or have and charged 2$ extra for the sandwiches. Miss charm argues with me, then realizing HER mistake corrects the bill.   All I can say is:  smelly place, bad food, even worse service. I'm not going to ever go back.   Really shabby in every respect.  Such a shame because they can do better."}
{"text":"Our experience at JJ Madison's  was very good.  The food was good.  I had the Roman Lasagna which was excellent. It was so plentiful,  I needed to take some home.  Jeff said his meatloaf was good. The service was great. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Waited 40 minutes at lunch for food.   Peeps coming in after us served before us.    Not friendly.    Going back to blue 32.   Worth the drive for better food and service"}
{"text":"This bar is near our Red Mountain softball complex which is where my buddies and I play softball every week. So this place became a weekly tradition for a hang out spot.  Plus if you are in a softball team, you get a discount on beer pitchers! Score!  They have got a patio, shuffle board, and one of those testosterone challenging boxing games which always draws a lot of inebriated crowd. Anyways, for drinks, this place is great because they've always got some special going on for beer and cocktails. They also serve beer in huge mugs (upto 32 or 40 oz I believe).   First I was on the fence about food here, but the ribs, burgers, and sandwiches are actually quite good. I mean it's bar food, but it did surprise me. If you're in the neighborhood or play softball near by, it's worth checking it out!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i both had the rib eye steak. Both were perfectly prepared.  Lisa was very attentive and helpful.  Dessert was amazing. We will be back."}
{"text":"First time visiting and will be back. It is a typical bar and grill. There are some pros and cons but I had a good time. Food was fairly prices but small in portion. Food was pretty good and there were lots of beer to choose from to include my Stella. Service was very quick and staff was nice at my table. It was super tight on the bar and pool table side and you have to choke back the smoke as they put all the smokers outside by the front door. It was humid inside but there were lots of people. They have lots of tv's and have poker and trivia to play. Decent little bar that was fun to relax.  If you go expecting fine dining or a commercial ran buffalo wild wings, then don't go. There really is no dress code as I saw people in shorts and tank tops. And they were the staff. Give it a try! I will."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, his sister, best friend, and I came here last Saturday. We had a nice time playing pool, and were very pleased with the service we received. The bar was full, but we were still able to get our drinks almost immediately. I had three of the best Bloody Mary's I've ever tasted, and my beers were only $1 each. I didn't know  that Saturdays were ladies night! Otherwise, I would've given this bar a try much sooner. There is a very diverse crowd of people that this bar attracts, but everyone we spoke to was very polite! The only disappointment of the night was the free ride home. I've been told a lot of great things about a free cab ride they offer, but after waiting 30 minutes for the driver to come get us, we gave up and called Discount Cab. However, it was Saturday, so I'm sure the cab service was pretty busy. I think next time we'll just ride our longboards. All in all, pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"We really liked this place at first, but less and less each time we went. They have a wide selection of burgers which are pretty good. Wings and O rings are also good. Philly cheese steak and fish were so so. Salad, yuk! Always busy though, so lots of people must really love the place.  With so many other great restaurants to choose from, we decided to give this one up for a while."}
{"text":"I've been here hundreds of times and it's always been good, not great but, good. The only reason I'm giving two stars and not one is because they had \"name that tune\" which was a lot of fun. Outside of that, the service was horrible. It started with my attempt to arrange transportation to Jjs. I contacted mike about 45 minutes before I needed a ride as Jjs provides a courtesy shuttle. He told me they don't really \"schedule\" rides and to just call back about 5 minutes before I needed to be picked up. Ok....so I call 5 minutes before and then he tells me 15 minutes?!? Wtf?!? So at this point, and after sensing his clear disinterest in helping me, I decide to just take myself there. Now because of this, I've chosen not to drink since I now have to drive. My plan was to spend a ton of money there on drinks for me and my friends so, looks like Jjs just lost money.   Now on to the bartender. 1) slower than molasses 2) never seen her there before, perhaps she is new 3) flat at rude, was ignored twice while clearly waiting for service 4) lied and said she was the manager 5) did not smile once 6) aren't you supposed to personable and friendly of you're a bartender? Someone get this girl a personality! 7) when called out on the above, she rolled her eyes, pouted like a child then walked away!"}
{"text":"My table and the table next to me did not receive our food for an hour and a half, and when some of it arrived, it was cold. I was informed that my original meal had accidentally been given to another customer at a table across the room. I found him, and he had indeed eaten my meal. but he said only after arguing with the waitress that she had brought him the wrong food. Finally, he just gave up and ate it. Thus, I had to wait an hour and a half while my food was being cooked, and the baked potato still came out cold after I was assured I would receive hot food. I walked the potato to their kitchen myself and asked them to heat it in the microwave. My chicken plate arrived separately, and it was hot as promised. Some of the waitresses seemed disengaged from their customers, and there was a lot of noise and laughter coming from the kitchen. I could not find the manager, although the table next to me was offered a choice of having different food after their food arrived late and cold. After I finally ate, a table of eight people received their food right away. Their food is delicious, and usually the service is not this bad. I am hoping this was an \"off\" night."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Everyone that works here is friendly and I love the food.  I really like that they are constantly changing food options on their menus and providing different everyday food specials.  Each time you go there its never the same: a few different food options, different entertainment like live bands, video bingo."}
{"text":"Four stars for their wings! A lot of flavors to chose from, the wings are nice and plump, plus you can have ranch and blue cheese dressing on the side. And they give plenty of celery and carrots. Thursday nights they have a wings special, .44 wings. Great selection of beer too. The only thing is, the 2 times I've been there is hasn't been as clean as I would have liked it to be. But it has improved :)"}
{"text":"Large menu, food we have tried has all been good Like the ambience and the beer is cold Service at the bar has been spotty, overall not a big deal Plan to go back"}
{"text":"The food was 3 out of 5 stars but the price was right. Lots of flat screens which was nice. Our food came out fast except we had to wait nearly 25 minutes for the cookie skillet desert. If that's usual then it would of been nice to have been told it would take that long. That's excessively long in my opinion and the reason why I won't be taking my family back. Also, it says it's kid friendly but there were no kids meals listed in the menu. The waitress apologized and read them aloud to us. It would of been nice to have it on the menu."}
{"text":"The great deal is the $2 margaritas!  We had a party of 4 and to get just water it took a good 5-10 minutes.  The service wasn't great, although the waitress was nice when she finally did arrive.  We started with the JJ Sampler which included some hard chicken fingers, the quesadilla was nothing special, the cheese sticks are like any other frozen cheesesticks we've had but my party seemed to like the wings which we got in medium and had some sauce all over them.  We also got a side of wings in hot and no, they weren't hot but they were a little dry.  We got 2 carrots on the side which were white and old and 2 pieces of yellow celery, but the ranch was tasty.  We also tried the queso dip which was pretty good and the chips were crunchy but a little soggy at the bottom with all the grease dripping.  The prickly pear tequila chicken didn't go good with the sweet of the pear nor did I taste the tequila which came with a side of veggies-in this case zuchhini.  The only thing I liked about this meal were the mashed potatoes and gravy!  We also tried the Hawkeye burger which I was told was good and the Top Sirloin which was cooked to perfection but lacked flavors and came with the same sides as my chicken.  Although you can choose any other type of potatoe I think the mashed potatoe's consistency and brown gravy was truly a hit.  To sum it up, JJ Madison's needs a drawer full of spices.  Not coming back nor recommending it unless we have to stop by this place to use the restroom after going tubing in the salt river...."}
{"text":"Help staff is rare. Menu items are missing. Parking is easy. Think this is the last trip for us."}
{"text":"(This is in the old Famous Sams location. I guess it has a new name now.) I had to break my \"no spending money\" in Mesa policy, but only because it was my mom's birthday and she lives there. I had read in the paper that JJ Madisons had just opened, so we decided to check it out. JJ Madisons is a sports bar and has everything you would expect: tons of flat screen tvs with a football game playing, pool tables, decent happy hour beer prices, overweight suburbanites, arcade games, a spot for a band, and a menu full of many delicious options. The server was friendly and amiable; she joked with me like we were good chums, but not in that phony annoying way. I had a tough time choosing what to get, but settled on the Philly. It was stuffed with delicious meat and grilled onions. All their bread comes from a local bakery in Tempe, too. I never went to the Famous Sams that used to be here, so I'm not sure if it's the same stuff with a new look. I don't usually like sports bars, but I'd go back here."}
{"text":"This may just turn into one of my favourite restaurants. I just had a meal prepared exactly like I wanted it. The service was great, the parking adequate , and the location convenient. I will be back for, sure, and give them a shot at that fifth star.  ************  8/8/2017 I have been back twice. I am not sure why I was so enthusiastic about this place on my first visit. This is just another sports bar with off track betting. It has a remarkably expanded menu that is well thought out very appealing. The food is well prepared and the service is OK. Both are dependent on how busy they are and staffing. I will leave the four stars with the caveat that sometimes they don't live up to it."}
{"text":"Great sports bar here in Mesa. I stopped in for lunch on a weekday and while the poor waitress working the dining room seemed to be on her own, she still did a great job of keeping me taken care of. The candied bacon was enough on it's own to bring me back in, but the burger was also very good!"}
{"text":"So....I have been to jj's many many times with friends.  However all these times we just hung out at the bar where the bartenders are excellent, food is great, and the prices are hard to beat.   Now I know what your asking..\"Ryan, why only 3 stars!?\". Settle down baby birds I'll explain.       Last night was the first time I tried the \"restaurant\" part of jj's.  My girlfriend and I had a groupon so I decided to take her out and try this place that I've had great past experiences with.  We take are seat, the server comes and takes our drink order (has to double check because she apparently can't write down bud light over coors light?).  That was the last we ever saw of her.  Another server comes to take over (seemed new) and brings us the wrong drinks.  She explains to us that it's wing night and you can order increments of 5.  We ordered 20 as well as a couple burgers for our entrees.      Now, onto the not so fun part.  First part was the wings, now let me tell you they were quite good, not the best I've had but enjoyable to say the least.  The only complaint in this department was that we only received 18 instead of the 20 we ordered.  Now that may not sound like a big deal to others, but I enjoy my wings and I would like to get what I asked for, doesn't everyone?!.  The server apologized and had the cooks make us some more that we could take home.  Our current mood, peeved but not angry, we patiently waited for our burgers.  Now as we waited....and waited....and waited... watching tables around us arrive later and get their food earlier, we finally get our food.  But! We got the wrong order! Bah humbug now that is frustrating!  We flag the waitress down and let her know, she mumbles an apology and goes and gets the right order.  Finally, our entree has arrived.  The burgers are quite delicious which is about the only thing saving the experience.  Towards to latter part of the night we notice the manager come to tables all around the area asking how everyones food was and he even apologized to a table next to us for them having to wait awhile.  They did not wait as long as us however!  Well, did we get an apology? Nope...Did he even come see how our food was? Nope...  Did we leave upset? Heck yes we did....  Shame on you JJ's...."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review like this because our waitress Nicole was absolutely wonderful and was extremely nice! However when my mother in law, boyfriend and I  sat down to dinner she complained of smelling something like Bengay. Neither one of us could smell what she was smelling so we just brushed it off. She later complained about lack of appetite and that's when we were worried. She stopped eating her burger and just drank her beer. It wasn't until she moved the sauce holder that she found the source of the smell. Some asshole had spit out his chewed tobacco and the crew had neglected to clean the table properly. We were eating next to someone's fucking chewed tobacco. That is so gross. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Of the 3 times I have gone in here each of them was bad. I sit at the bar and either ignored by the women bartenders or they are snappy and rude or the food has been bad. I think what bothers me most is the awful attitude of the people working here acting as if your bothering them by being there. I have left 1 of the 3 times without ordering even a drink after 10 min of waiting with no hello or anything sitting at the bar! It seems like they have their regulars and they are happy with just them."}
{"text":"Very good service. Lots of young people working.  Fish is great, especially the salmon.  Been here a few times. My only complaint was the wine selection, which I mentioned to the waiter, bartender & manager.  I don't think I got thru to them because of replies to go to their web page & post for the franchise managers.  One kind of white wine? Cheap, & bitter. That's what happens when your from Wine Country! LOL"}
{"text":"Dark & cozy sports bar. The service is fast and friendly. Good variety of drinks. Their menu is extensive and varied, but everything I have tried there is always just a bit lacking. Nothing really wrong with the food, just nothing I would crave or even necessarily order again. If they just worked on the food, this would be more of a regular place for us."}
{"text":"We went  there for lunch recently.  Since we work in the area we thought we would try them again.  It took us 30 mins to get our food.   Very disappointed again! No more stars for you!"}
{"text":"I stopped in after a round of golf on a hot day.  The beer was cold and that was all I cared about.  So it fit its purpose for the day.    It also has the national Buzztime trivia and poker games and the poker seems to be a popular thing.  I personally like trivia and have played it for decades.  I will probably be back for this reason alone.  There is off track betting and the usual denizens that brings with it.  Not especially a problem, just an observation."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow; we sat there forever with only our drinks, and it took almost an hour for the food to finally come out. They seem very disorganized and don't seem to know what servers are supposed to do what tables. They made 2 out of 4 orders wrong, and the food was subpar at best. Server was too overwhelmed. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast because they were showing the Ram game. I like the abundance of big screen tvs in the place. There were so many tvs that they actually showed the Rams game in the corner. My fajita breakfast was pretty good. However, the waitress was slow, she put ice tea in our coffee, forgot to give us salsa and tortillas with the meal. I would go back to watch a football game, I would like to try the po' boy sandwich next time, I rarely see that on the menu outside of New Orleans. Next time I will prepare myself for the subpar service."}
{"text":"We come in often because we get coupons in the mail. The food is pretty good, which is why we keep coming back. But EVERY TIME we do come to JJ's we end up waiting a minimum of 10 minutes before we are greeted by a server or anyone for that matter. My husband and I agree, the management needs to really consider customer service and having more servers to wait on tables. At noon on a Saturday, during football season, it is necessary to have more than one server."}
{"text":"I've been here many times.  It's really just a sports bar but used to have pretty good food. They have good fish on Fridays and the clam chowder is always tastey too. The service is often slow. Tonight we had very slow service and terrible food.  I ordered chicken tenders which the menu describes as breaded and got batter dipped tenders that had clearly been microwaved and turned into leather along with old fries. My husband's fries were old too and the bun his burger was on was dry as well. The waitress was apologetic but still ungodly slow.  The manager clearly knew we weren't happy with our food as the waitress took him the bill for adjustment but didn't have a single word of apology.  Don't worry about seeing me again.  The meal I was served was basically a big sign that said \"f you\" in a grease stained basket."}
{"text":"Absolutely love hanging out here. Enjoy the staff, drinks, and prices. Great food as well."}
{"text":"Had a great meal. Our waitress, Reyna, was great. She was friendly and service was quick. My husband had a very good lasagna and I had super good chicken wings. Always good food here."}
{"text":"The service was terrible I was served with a glass that had lipstick stains on it I told the bartender and he said \"Ohh Ok\" and walked away,right before I even orederd that Beer,I asked the waitress for a Beer and she walked away like she was getting it for me,waited for the exra 5 minutes before another bartender asked me what I wanted,I asked for a Budlight and he came back with my drink after he set it down I notcied as he walked away the lipstick stains,I told them about it and they acted like they didnt care,They ignored me\" and shrugged there shoulders and said ,whats the problem as I was looking at my glass,I said my glass is dirty..\"Ohh ok\"..ands walked off,that Bar sucks,nowonder nobody goes there anymore,besides the fact  Mesa Cops hang out there and watch that place...The guy who Drives the Van for them is very polite,the Bar tenders should learn a thing or 5 off of him...The service there  SUCKED will never go back.\" It wasnt the first time this has happened,gave it a second go,and the place still SUCKED,they need a WHOLE NEW CREW.Seriously."}
{"text":"The food was okay ... the service was okay .... It's just another dine bar, but I've been to better. The floor under our table hadn't been swept so there was food and a crushed can leftover from the last guests. They have a pool table which is a nice distraction. They had a live band playing with a sax which was entertaining. It's an alright place, but would be my last choice."}
{"text":"First time to JJs last friday. We heard they had good fish dinner. The advice was good. It was very good. the place was full at 5:00 but we got in fast and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places .... IF THEY PREPARE THE FOOD as per the menu desciptions.  This seems to be my biggest problem with this wonderful little find - the cooks in the back ad lib at will.    Today's adventure was a chef salad with literally two chopped onions inside.  I don't like onions and didn't think to order it no ONIONS because, well, after the 20 or 30 times I have had it in the past, it never had onions.  So, I traded it with the new strawberry salad and added (and paid for, mind you) grilled chicken... No chicken.. but the salad is wonderful.  The owner always makes it right and I adore the attention he gives to my orders when I call..... but the message is rarely sent to the kitchen.  Oh well, of course I'll keep trying."}
{"text":"Love the fish fry and broasted chicken.  The clam chowder is some of the best I've ever had!  These are the only things I eat here so I can't speak to anything else.  I would have given 5 stars but the service is sketchy.  Sometimes great, sometimes terrible.  Don't go in the winter....packed with snowbirds."}
{"text":"I love this place! The beer is cold and the people are fun to hang out with! Waitress's are the best!"}
{"text":"Ok to start I live a mile away so I'm a regular. There are plenty of other places for me to go and I choose to go to JJ's. The staff are great, friendly and quick. They always have a smile and I have to say that I CRAVE the wings! Not too saucy, perfectly crispy. Yummm!!   Some of the negitive ratings on here aren't fair. You have to really know what you're talking about when you rate this bar. lol  Food is great. Beer is cold. Patrons are mixed. Young to old. It's got that hometown bar feel, and I dig that!!"}
{"text":"We live very close to this restaurant and this was our 3rd or 4th trip in the first time the food was great and the rest of the times it was just ok. My boy friend wanted fish and chips so we decided to try one more time - uugghhh !!!! it was one of the most disappointing meals I have ever had.  Crappy service, waitress was very short and cold - tried to warm up to her and make small talk didn't really seem to help much. Another waitress brought out our food , but we never got our appetizer and had to ask for the soup to be brought out and for silverware . The food was barely luke warm and my burger and bacon tasted like fish- I DONT LIKE FISH!!!!  Tried to finish my food so as not to waste the money but finally we gave up and went to another restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place. Went here for first time because our regular broasted chicken place closed their doors unexpectedly. (Loosers didn't pay their rent)  Food and service were excellent. Amazing attentive staff all helping each other and making sure everyone was well taken care of. Huge menu. We can't wait to go back and try some more. It was refreshing to go somewhere that service is obviously important to the people working there."}
{"text":"This is a remodeled Famous Sam's , I was just there last night and they are finishing up the woman's bathroom with new tile floor and paint. It looked really nice!  Now on to the good stuff! On Thursday nights JJ Madisons has a great dinner deal! BOGO (Buy on get one) Free Burger nights! They have awesome burgers and great if you are on a budget!  They offer great local beer, again Santan Brewing company Devil's Ale is on Tap! Yummy!! This  is a sports bar, they have many TV's and pool tables, but they also offer wine tastings and beer tastings, so it's not your typical sports bar! G the manager is wonderful and we always have great service. If you are in the Mesa area JJ's is worth a try!"}
{"text":"Ive lived in East Mesa most of my life. JJ used to be a huge party spot, and it died down big time. Slowly but surely it is coming back though. The crowd is getting bigger and its getting younger again. Still has a ton of different beers on taps, also has a cooler for the beer snobs full of craft beer. JJ has recently also gotten a facelift inside, which has been taken care of a lot better. The food has gotten 10X better also. I never really had any complaints but they went above and beyond with the food. I had the broaster chicken one night and had to get a 2nd order because they were so damn good. Its still a divey bar in the area but you can always count on good people, cold beer and something always going on there. Also, beer is pretty damn cheap, even after happy hour you wont go broke tying one on."}
{"text":"I like JJ Madison's. we always enjoy our time there. Stacy is a sweet server and always friendly and quick to greet us even if we aren't in her section."}
{"text":"Loved my food but the bartender Gee was honestly the worst I've ever had. I stood at the bar for 15 minutes after asking him to refill my water and he finally asked a random server to do it for him because he didn't want to fill it up."}
{"text":"Had to burn some time while my truck was getting worked on. Came here and had a beer at the bar. Asked the bartender what she recommended and I followed her advice, the Cuban sandwich and it is outstanding!"}
