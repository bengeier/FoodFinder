{"text":"Terrible terrible service the so called manager and her girlfriends have the nastiest attitudes. The online ordering system is simple but they seem to screw it up in store 60% of the time.  Like telling me they never received my order until we showed our confirmation then all of the sudden you received the order but it was \"unclear\"  I've spent a lot of money here because I like the good but these bimbos just lost my business for good."}
{"text":"I've been ordering pizza for years but today was the worst of all the person who took my order was alexis so rude .had me wait  for 1hr for pizza &wings now it been 1hr20mins r u serious !!!!!  8:46 pizza  never came"}
{"text":"They have great pizza and wings. My only complaint with this restaurant is you can order wings medium one time and their great, the next time there really weak, and than you get the medium that's too hot to eat. They need consistency in their wing sauce!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza and wings!  The best thin crust pizza I have had in Arizona!!  Prompt and friendly delivery too."}
{"text":"No. The pizza is weird. Gave this place a try once. Burnt pizza and didn't get what we ordered. Gave this place a second chance. Burnt pizza again, and wrong order AGAIN. They were very rude the first time. The second time they were super friendly. When i got home and realized the order was wrong I called and was literally laughed at. Will never be going back."}
{"text":"This place should be much closer to 5 stars. Pizza is always top notch. Delivery has always been faster than quoted. I've been a Barros junkie for 15 years, but this pizza is just as good, if not better, and cheaper. Props to these people. Extra cheese and pepperoni is my go to and never disappoints. Cheers."}
{"text":"I order from here regularly since it's so close to my house and good quality pizza and wings for the price. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is for some of the service. I've had a driver deliver my pizza and not have any cash on him even though I informed them I was paying cash, so he had to go back and then come back to my house an hour later, I had plans and that was inconvenient. Also on New Year's Eve we were surprised by the wait time was only 45 minutes, well that's because it was actually an additional 40 minutes- they could have just been honest and stated that. I also feel like when I go to pick it up I'm ignored at the counter while they're just chatting with people for awhile. Good food but poor service over all."}
{"text":"My review is for the chicken wings only, they are some of the best I have eaten. Very impressive. Friendly staff. Strip was sketchy looking , but the place is clean on the inside."}
{"text":"I called U S PIZZA to see if they delivered. They said they had boundaries and asked for my address. The girl on the phone seemed unfamiliar with the area and gave me a phone number and said that location delivered to my area. I called the number and was told it would be about an hour. After an hour I received a call from U S Pizza stating that I was not within their boundaries and I would have to meet their pizza deliver man about two miles from my house after he finished his other deliveries. He finally finished and called me close to two hours since my pizza was ordered but I finally  had a pizza. The pizza was good after I reheated it but they definitely need to train the employees answering the phone what the boundaries are and where they deliver."}
{"text":"Usually wings are great! But last 3 Times, I have asked for extra crispy wings. This last time I got soggy wings (last 3 orders) that were cold. Thin crust pizza...... I am tired of buying things and getting screwed. I think it's time I take my business elsewhere. Keep in mind I order wings & pizza at least 2-3 times a week.  Their loss not mine.... bye Felicia!!!"}
{"text":"So got a small personal pizza , it was ok, got the 12 hot wings they were ok, 45 minutes wait not ok."}
{"text":"We order from this place because the pizza is decent. They have constantly forgot items ln our order and today they actually forgot to deliver our order until I called to see what was going on. I dont know if we are going to continue with this place."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Ordered a medium originally and the unqualified girl taking the order said she gave me the xl deal bc it's cheaper, I said, ok give me an xl then. (Side note: I've ordered an xl before) they gave me a medium or large and charged me for an xl. Called to complain, wench hung up on me saying there's no manager. Called back and she hung up on me again, the next time I called back some wannabe gangster tried to tell me he was in charge and that I shouldn't yell at underage girls. First off, not my problem how old they are, second, never yelled at them. These jerks have always overpriced their crap product and then treat their customers like crap. I will never order from here again, come Tuesday I will be talking to the actual manager in person. Heaven forbid they say, \"sorry we ripped you off\". Complete garbage company!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza we've had in years! However, don't plan to eat in until they discover plates, knives, and forks. Good thing they deliver."}
{"text":"I got 2 large 2 topping pizzas for like 18 bucks and they are amazing. I have 3 stars because I have not tried their wings. I will definitely be going back. Great place."}
{"text":"My family and I love us pizza! Great food 90% of the time the only negatives are they usually take an hour or more to get the food although it is well worth the wait the wings are fantastic sometimes the timing is bad my wife and kids love there food as well all around they are great I would recommend as I often do before any other pizza place. Prices are better than what you can get from anywhere else especially for the great quality of food."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time a month ago. To bad I don't live in the area because I would be a regular. The pizza was by far one of the best pizza's I have had EVER. I took advantage of the lunch special and boy was I impressed. For $5.00 you get a personal size pizza and soda with unlimited toppings. I don't eat pork but I loaded my pizza with sauce and veggies. I ate that bad boy like it was my last meal. This is one pizza I can say was finger licking good.   It is a small establishment that is built for to go orders. No place to sit for dining. They have a few other items besides pizza but trust me you need to try this Pizza it is amazing. My friends ordered other items such as a sandwich, wings and churro which they all thought was delicious. The woman who took our order was very patient and kind. When I am on that side of town I will be back to grab some food to go."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery & boy did it take forever to get our pizza & wings. This would be my first & last period. Didn't really care for the pizza & wings because they were not hot & fresh by the time we got it. I would recommend to order else where."}
{"text":"The wings are so good. The mild bbq mix ones are the bomb. Don't forget the super delish ranch. Pizza is good but wings are better ;)"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Ordered a sausage and mushroom pizza and hot wings. Both were very good! The hot wings packed just the right amount of heat, and the crust on the pizza was not too thin and not too thick. The pizza was delivered later than we were told (by about 10 minutes) but it was worth the wait. We will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"My wife always comes here for pizza , the kids loveeee it, their wings were really good ! Read another post about the bbq mild mix  they were amazing and I'm not even a wing fan! Their salad was a little depressing , the salad was super soggy probably was made in the morning so it had sat but who goes to a pizza joint for salad? Will be coming here for my pizza as long as I live in el mirage !:)"}
{"text":"US pizza is so good their ranch is delicious. I love mushroom pizza. They don't have fountain drinks but they do offer a wide variety sizes of Coca-Cola's Pepsi's root beers Mountain Dew's and sprites. Good eats."}
{"text":"We ordered a large pizza for delivery at our hotel room. Everything about the experience was great! Friendly person took our call, said it would be about 45 minutes for our pizza. Friendly knock on our door 30 minutes later and pizza was delish!"}
