{"text":"Qui Ristorante Pizzeria  1654 St. Clair Ave W  Absolutely wonderful dining experience! We ordered the margarita pizza, fried calamari, and the meatball special. The pizza was among the best I've ever tasted, that includes New York, Italy, and the hippest joints in Toronto. The service was friendly and attentive. We took the servers recommendation for wine, which was also quite good. Will definitely go again! Great addition to the area - I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to some italian deliciousness.......but unfortunately this wasn't the place to get it.   The lighting as soon as we got there was harsh and fluorescent......may I suggest candles and tablecloths perhaps? Wine selection:  not great.    The OO that came with our bread was really spicy. Of the 2 pizzas: one was good with prosciutto and olives was great.  The wood stove oven does make a great pizza, but the toppings on the rapini/sausage pizza had absolutely no taste."}
{"text":"I was really excited for this addition to the neighborhood and I am still hopeful that with some simple changes this place could be great. Having been in the foodservice industry for 28 years and working as a consultant for the past 8 - I may be a little picky but I know what works.  Everything was ok. Not great. Not bad. Just ok. Immediately we were disappointed by the fluorescent lights coming from the open kitchen with the old office style ceiling panels and yellow walls with a tobacco coloured ceiling. This really affected the ambience and atmosphere and we almost walked out, but decided to look past it and give it a chance.  They have a beautiful wood burning pizza oven but it was overshadowed by the fluorescent lights which is unfortunate. The music playing was really odd. Not even sure what to call it. The service was a bit clumsy but pleasant. You can tell the server was new but he was attentive. He would come back and refill our water but not refill  our wine glasses. No big deal.   The wine list was very limited (3 red options) and our bottle was served very warm. I'd say 25c. There should definitely be more variety on the list to cater to different tastes. We only had 2 pizzas so I can't comment on anything else.  One was very bland and I questioned the quality of the ingredients used as you couldn't even taste the shredded (?) Sausage as it was very dry. It was basically a rapini pizza.  The second was better but still not great for an $18 personal pizza. If it weren't for the kalamata olives it would have been  pretty bland. The crusts were decent for both.  We discussed this with the server and saw the chef / owner walking around talking to people but she wouldn't come to our table. If I was the owner i would welcome people's feedback especially in a new establishment. The server asked for feedback so we offered some constructive criticism, instead of smiling and saying \"everything is fine\" and never returning. Hopefully they listen as some minor changes will really improve this place. Also no website or social media presence in this market is not an option.  I had to have the menu read to me over the phone. At very least have one available to email potential customers. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and friendly service. We are super excited about this addition to the neighbourhood!! We were served quickly, the pizza was ready very fast, was very good and was proper thin-crust traditional Neapolitan style.  Four stars only because they didn't have their liquor license yet - can't wait to have a glass of wine with this delicious pizza.  Recommend highly!!"}
{"text":"Great resto. Great food. Welcome to the neighborhood.. We will see you often. Thanks for making a special l plate of pasta for our little guy"}
{"text":"They know how to make soups! potato leaks, chicken soups, any soup would be just fine! Excellent tasty food, pizzas and the beet salad with gorgonzola, can't go wrong with that. I had the meatballs tonight, everything about them was delicious, amazing tomato sauce, the best I have ever had, reminds me of my mother's tomato sauce. Thursdays $6.00 wine, excellent wine!, great service!"}
{"text":"So new that they are still waiting on their liquor licence to come through, this place went above and beyond to make an impression, and we will definitely be regulars.  Reasonably priced and high quality, good food. Pizza had mushrooms, olives, artichoke and ham (I cannot remember what it was called, sorry) and was well cooked, with that perfect combo of crispy outside but chewy inside. Penne was a perfect portion and good texture with a creamy tomato sauce. You can tell this kitchen takes pride in the food they serve.  Server was new and nervous but clearly well trained and lovely, with a bit of practice, she'll get over the jitters.  They also let our curious toddler see how a pizza was made and used the dough prepped to make her a dessert of fried dough, powdered sugar and nutella - which sounds unimpressive until you eat it, at which point you can't stop eating it (it's like funnel cake).  These folks are great, and I think this will be a really nice addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"So happy to have this new place open up in our neighborhood. Simple delicious recipes... This is a working class area but hoping enough people step up to the plate to keep this fine place going. The owners are super nice and I will do my small part to ensure their success... the heavy lifting will be done by their excellent food and service."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend a few nights ago spontaneously, having chosen it since it was near my house and the menu seemed reasonable online. When we arrived, it was pretty empty so we got our choice of seating. I imagine if it was busier, it would be a pretty cozy atmosphere.   The bread was okay (could have benefited from a light toasting before being served so that it was warm), and the spiced olive oil dip was a little too spicy for me. I think I would have preferred olive oil and balsamic vinegar. My friend has a much better spice tolerance than I do. We ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer to share, and it was delicious! The squid was very soft, not overcooked. The breading was light and not greasy. The serving size was very generous and appropriate given its price tag. I had the lasagna, and while the presentation was a little underwhelming, it was very tasty!  It held together well. Overall, the food is definitely great and I will probably return here when the mood for Italian strikes again."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. We got a pasta dish (smoked salmon) and the italiana pizza. Our server was polite and attentive. Definitely going back for seconds."}
{"text":"I'm a chef who's been in the field for 15 plus years which doesn't make me an expert by any means, however, this is just my unbiased opinion of Qui. I dined there last night with my partner and we were immediately greeted and seated by the gm. After perusing the specials board , which all sounded delicious, we decided to go with the calamari fritti to start and for our mains the affumicato  pizza and my partner the margherita with prosciutto di Parma. Calamari were done properly , not over cooked, tender but crispy on the outside,seasoned perfectly. The affumicato was topped with speck and scamorsa cheese and was the perfect balance of salt, cheese and meat and finished perfectly with a drizzle of  house made chilli oil. The margherita pizza was mouth watering made even better with the authentic melt in your mouth prosciutto, the pizza sauce was also done well not to sweet not to salty. We both agreed that we would return to give the other items on the menu a try. Great dinner!!"}
{"text":"Really nice, new restaurant for the area. Has a nice, casual vibe to it. Went for lunch with a group and had a lovely experience. We had fried calimari, bruschetta(made with fresh, sweet tomatoes),and a variety of pizzas made fresh in their wood burning pizza oven. Simple decor, attentive servers and great, freshly prepared food. Love the front garage door windows that can be rolled up. Cloth napkins are a really nice touch too. Will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"So happy to have finally tried this spot last week. In our neighbourhood where eating choices are limited I am thrilled to have Qui and intend to be there regularly!  Meatball special was clean flavoured and hit the spot. Pizza was excellent, the prosciutto we added so delicious.  I can't wait to be back this weekend for calamari, pasta, and dessert - all of which seemed tempting had we had room...  Welcome!"}
