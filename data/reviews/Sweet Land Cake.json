{"text":"Ordered a birthday cake and not only did the owner sit down with me to personally write up the order, discuss every detail of what I wanted, he made a delicious cake!  Visually impeccable and delicious.  The buttercream was absolutely perfect and light. I will definitely order every cake from Sweet Land"}
{"text":"This place has pan sobao (sweet island bread from heaven...I don't do carbs but I will do these haha) and quesitos (a flaky warm cheese danish in a honey glaze) and they are fresh and delish. I've had thier Cuban sandwich and hands down this is authentic, not some weak interpretation (ive had a hard time getting a good cuban sandwich in AZ, they pretty much all have been horrible, no matter how fancy...the bread is key and so is the pernil...no one else has gotten it even close...sorry not sorry). I've also tried the alcapurrias (a plantain fritter filled with picadillo (beef cooked with sofrito-a blend of bell peppers, cilantro, onion a bunch of there things and happiness) - they are excellent.  This is a small place and things are cooked to order, this takes time, so be prepared for this. It's also small inside. I def come here for the food not ambiance."}
{"text":"We are Puerto Rican so we were so excited to find this place! Definitely try the medianoche sandwich and the Puerto Rican coffee.  Yummy.  Great pineapple upside down cake and if you need a special occasion cake made, this is the place to come."}
{"text":"Such a blessing to find a home away from home bakery that has all the things I love about Puerto Rico! The owners wife is super sweet, helpful and extremely friendly. It's hard being in such a large county with a low population of Puerto Rican so I'm super happy I found this little gem! Ohhh and the pastries, food and bread is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Hacen unos quesitos sabroso,  el pan es delicioso.  Y tienen variedad de productos puertorriqueños"}
{"text":"Great to have some of our homemade delicacies available locally. The pan sobao isn't too sweet but it is delicious especially if you're lucky to get it fresh baked out of the oven. The pastelillos de guayaba are delicious. You have to order to mayorcas in advance and man are they delicious fresh out of their oven. Only thing is I placed an order 4days ahead and still had to wait over 1hr for my order on the day for pickup (plus side was-my order was HOT & fresh) BUT the delay made me lay to get started on my 6hr road trip."}
{"text":"From outside, you'd only expect this place to have sweet pastries and cakes. That observation is so very wrong. A step inside and you quickly learn all of the tasty food this bakery/Cafe has to offer.   Cubano sandwich Medianoche sandwich Tripleta sandwich Pavo sandwich Jamon y queso (ham and cheese)  Various cuchifritos and alcapurrias Oh and pan sobao  We ordered cuchifritos - 4 carne pastelillos (beef empanadas) to go.   Made from scratch, they are decently sized. Great texture to the dough. Filling was nicely seasoned.  Reminded me of me time in PR and all the delicious food I had there. We'll definitely be back to try more from their menu!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed when I walked in, the selection was very small and I was on the hunt for a cupcake and when I found this place it says cake in the name and they didn't have any cake at all. So that's confusing. But the lady was friendly and the other few things they had did look good."}
{"text":"This is a legit puertorrican bakery, been looking for Pan Sobao since moving here and they guys have it and it's really good. They carry lots of stuff, quesitos, pastelillos de guayaba, tornillos, etc. Great service, every taste super fresh. They also carry different types of coffees, salchichas Carmela, Arroz Rico. Good prices and they have tables to eat there. Alcapurrias are extremely good. Visit them now!"}
{"text":"I've died and gone to heaven. Pan sobao, quesitos and pastelillos de guayaba. Brazo gitano. And the list goes on and on. Puerto Rican coffee. Mallorcas need to be ordered in advance. ¡Sabroso!"}
