{"text":"I love that Wingzza has a sauce named after our NBA team...I had 5 Hornets for lunch and they were just as described, a balance between honey and hot!  Lots of reviews point to the mambo (spelling?) sauce.  I ate one of these as well and loved a couple of things that I want to point out: 1). The \"viscosity\" of the mambo sauce was just right. 2). The mambo sauce reminded me of a very well executed Polynesian sauce...MMMMM! The Hornet sauce was not quite as thick and a little hotter than mambo.  This flavor is my favorite, but I do wish the viscosity of this sauce was thicker to be aligned with that of the mambo sauce."}
{"text":"Really??? $3.50 and 5 mins for a burnt up piece of disgusting pizza! They will never get my money again."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Wingzza last night.  Sausage and mushroom pizza and BBQ wings.  It was great.  The server was a nice young lady and the owner checked on us regularly.  Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Was running late for a meeting and needed a quick grab-n-go lunch.  Wingzza was sitting just outside the door, great luck!  Menu is pretty rudimentary: either wings or pizza (slice/whole).  They apparently have taken a limited menu approach: not a lot of options...a good business model for quick turn-around.   First, I'm not a huge fan of wings (too much effort for so little food and WAY TOO MESSY) so I opted for a slice of peperoni at $2.99.  The crust was toothy (a good thing) and didn't droop over my hand while eating it.  It did seem a bit greasy.  One or two slices should be plenty for lunch.  They offered standard canned sodas to wash everything down.     I did find the packaging, the slice sandwiched between two paper plates wasn't the best idea.  The cheese that melted onto the paper stuck and wouldn't let go without taking some of the paper with it.  The positive thing is that it's greener than styrofoam, maybe.     for you wings fans:  you can order as few as 5 ($4.30) or as many as 100 ($70) at spicy levels of: Mild, Medium, Hot, Spicy BBQ, Carolina Buffalo, The General, Mambo"}
{"text":"I love, love, LOVE food trucks and Wingzza is one of the best! Fresh, hot, fried wings and multiple sauce options including some you can't get anywhere else. I recommend the Mambo sauce flavor."}
{"text":"I ordered a med pizza, wings, and chicken fingers. The wings and fingers were of microwave quality. The pizza was not horrible, but it wasn't anything that I'd order again."}
{"text":"Fantastic foodtruck! I had my first opportunity to try out Wingzza out at the Chow Down Uptown event after I decided that I still wasn't full from eating so much from the other food trucks!  I decided to give the wings a try, and the owner was happy to answer all my questions about the different sauces (Mild, Medium, Hot, Spicy BBQ, Carolina Buffalo, The General, Mambo) that you can put on the wings. I decided to go with their Mambo sauce (which also is their most popular sauce), and it was AMAZING, it was mostly sweet but had maybe a really, REALLY tiny kick of spice. Now, I normally like my buffalo wings spicy but this was a good change and I wouldn't hesitate to get the mambo sauce again! The wings also had the perfect amount of batter, fried to perfection and were tender! Easily some of the best buffalo wings I've had! Next time I'm going to order like 30 wings and eat it ALL myself!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try this place for a while because there are no good wing places in the neighborhood.   I thought I would get some wings and fries.  No fries.  That's okay, but when I looked at the menu and saw the prices for the wings I wanted to leave.  I stayed and paid 89 CENTS per wing.  Almost $6 for 6 wings. To my surprise when I got home, they were the smallest wings I ever seen.  Needless to say I won't be returning.  The wings were fine but just not enough of them."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim for lunch. GREAT FOOD!  Everything was fresh. My wife who does not normally like wings ate all of mine. They were delicious.  The pizza was made exactly how we asked for it and it to was great.  The staff was friendly and the place clean. If you like pizza you will love this place."}
{"text":"Wingzza was parked at the Ballantyne Corporate park area on Wednesday, so I thought I would give it a try.  Ordered 10 wings (5 spicy bbq, 5 mambo) and a peperoni pizza slice.  After taking my order, took about 7 minutes before food was ready, reasonable time if making them to order.  Went back to the office where I ate my lunch.    First the pizza, I was not impressed by this.  Though okay, it smelled and tasted a lot like the Harris Teeter (grocery) ready made pizzas... I mean, almost exactly like them, possibly was (which are cheaper too).  The pizza bread is thick and toppings okay, would likely skip this if I go back again.  The wings were good, though they could have done a better job separating them since they were two flavors.  The mambo had a slight sweet taste, while the spicy bbq had a sweet tang too it, not really spicy.  The spicy bbq was better overall from the two I got.  Sauce was everywhere, very messy as wings go.  Overall was okay, they are over-hyped though."}
{"text":"Ok , this might a seasonal experience I had today, NOT good food, good places don't have seasonal, they are constant and consistent. Thou this was my first time at this truck, it was very disappointing. They might be running off there previous write ups and reviews. I work in the building that they visited today and give you it was raining and ugly. But no excuse for 30 sec wings pre cooked cold and over sauced, munchie of the day cream cheese jalape√±o poppers. Frozen over breaded crap. With store bought dipping sauce, come on guys where it the better than bar food fix you don't even sell beer. Please find your reason for starting a food truck and hope it was a passion not commission to drive you. And kick up your game"}
{"text":"YUMMY IN MY TUMMY! (c) Yo Gabba Gabba. I first encountered this glorious food truck @ the first ever Food Truck Rally downtown. Now I am a huge fan! Their pizza & wings are perfect; not like any I've ever tasted.  The sauce on the wings are plentiful, not overpowering. And the sauce...OMGEEEEEEE! Delicious!  As of now, they're on a hiatus due to an unfortunate fire on the truck; however, via their twitter, they hope to be \"back on the road\" again soon."}
{"text":"So, I was way stoked to try out Wingzza. I'd heard multiple mentions on TV, from friends who live out of town and from a few other Yelpers. I follow these guys on Twitter and was always hoping they'd camp out in the Southpark area one day to draw a lunch crowd. To no avail, I was forced to wait until this weekend! Happy to find these guys at Small Bar in the NC Music Factory for PBR Fest. Churning out pizza and wings for the beer crowd.   I had heard multiple cheers of praise and glory about this truck's pizza and wings. I was even a little intimidated approaching the order window. The staff were all very friendly and helpful with describing all of the menu items. We ended up getting two slices of cheese, a slice of the buffalo chicken and 5 Carolina Buffalo wings. We sat down with 24oz tallboys in hand and went to town.   I was happy to say that the wings are AWESOME. Perfectly cooked, a little crispy on the outside, not dry, tender, slathered generously with amazing sauce. The Carolina Buffalo is a winner. Mustard-based bbq with a plethora of buffalo sauce thrown in. My taste buds were happy. Uhh...they need to make a Carolina Buffalo pizza. (No brainer, yeah?)  The only thing that sank my happy sailing dinner experience was the pizza. A little lackluster and the sauce was a bit reminiscent of box pizza from the frozen section in the grocery store. Maybe our slices had been sitting out for a bit, but didn't have the freshest of textures. I did appreciate the crust and enjoyed sopping up the remainder of the wing sauce with them. I can't say that the pizza was banging on all cylinders or a culinary breakthrough, but is definitely reliable. The combo of wings and pizza in one meal from the street, though? Baller status. Grab a tallboy and it's all over. Foodtruck heaven.   So happy to have finally tried these guys out and can't wait to see them at Chowdown Uptown in the near future! Carolina Buffalo Pizza, guys! Let's see it happen!  Cheers."}
{"text":"I have been trying to track this truck down for months and I was finally able to do so since they had a spot at Speed Street this year.  I ordered the special(slice of pizza and wings) which were both pretty good but nothing all that special about it.  They offer several wing flavors and I tried the lemon pepper wings since they are my favorite....nice dry rub, again nothing special but I would like to try the mambo wings as I hear they are more popular."}
{"text":"Don't bother!! Terrible pizza terrible pasta terrible subs!! Philly cheese steak was cold in middle.  Alfredo sauce was not good. Pizza tasted like frozen grocery store pizza"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Charlotte I HAVE to have Wingzza. Not only do they have the Mambo sauce that I miss so much as a DC native, but the wing itself is large and of good quality. And because the pizza is SO good I always end up getting both and stuffing myself.   The pizza is unique to me because of the sauce, the sauce holds this thing together. It's almost sweet, but then savory, DEFINITELY not store bought. The chef hit the nail on the head with this stuff--it's addictive. Another winner for me is the crust, which is soft and fluffy, and just the right amount of density, because I hate heavy bread and I hate thin crispy NY style crust. My go-to slices are the Buffalo Chicken (that sauce is CRAZY), Philly Cheesesteak, and the classics like pepperoni or sausage.  All in all, this is the only food truck I've tried and will be loyal to in Charlotte. Plus, Larry (the owner) and the rest of the team are cool, fun, and nice. They can get my hard earned dollars each trip. Try them, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the Mambo sauce!!!! I put that *&%$ on EVERYTHING!!!! You must try it! I can't wait until they get a restaurant in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The wings were fresh and all, but overall pretty average. My big gripe is that they have wing in their name, but the blue cheese is prepackaged Ken's Steakhouse dressing. It really boggles my mind they don't make their own dressings and I can't see myself coming here again."}
{"text":"Wow.  I've been dying to try this place forever and the Beertopia event in Fort Mill gave me that opportunity.    The pizza is really good and better than some other quick serve (including delivery) places I've been to.  Wonderful sauce, great flavor on the pepperoni and dough was chewy.  The wings were tender and the hot sauce was flavorful.  The sauce was the same as a local pub I frequent but it is still one of my favorites.  So yes this deserves the 5 star rating.  Ordering was quick and they answered any questions I had and then 2 minutes after ordering my meal was ready and I was in food heaven.    Note:  Every festival in the area needs to stick with food truck options.  So much better than those typical festival food places."}
{"text":"I stopped by this joint because it's in the same plaza as my work place. I usually get my pizza lunch special across the street but I wanted to give this place a try since they just literally opened last week. Their lunch special comes with 2 slices of cheese pizza & a drink, for additional toppings it's 50 cents each. I ordered mushrooms on mine & paid $8.xx. It's a little more expensive than my regular pizza place but it's convenient because I don't have to leave the plaza. Anyway, their pizza was good but I think because it's super thin it gets soggy fast. Don't get me wrong I love thin, crunchy pizza but my pizza got soggy because I was waiting about 7-10 min. for my coworker's pizza to cook. They ran out of slices for the lunch special so they had to make a new pan. I did get a bite of my coworker's pizza and it was nice & crunchy, so I recommend eating your pizza right away. I also saw on the menu you can order wings & there is no minimum amount so if I wanted 3 wings, I guess I could just order 3? LOL. They had different flavors I've never never had before like peanut butter & jelly and alfredo sauce. Next time I'm going to try the wings because I heard their wings are supposed to be a big hit."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here watching the Titans and Chiefs game. Awesome pizza and great service I'll be back to try the wings."}
{"text":"Very good wings and pizza. Nice staff. There are many different types of flavors of wing sauce ( peanut butter and jelly)."}
{"text":"Great pizza, I can't wait to try more.  It's thin and crunchy!  Just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Came here from Michigan for vacation. Called to get pizza. Guy was super awesome to us, made us larger pizzas and they were AMAZING. So glad we stopped here."}
{"text":"I have been here before and I was not impressed but I always give places another try. Today I came here for lunch and ordered the shrimp combo. I was very disappointed. I bit into what looked like frozen shrimp you can get from the grocery store and it was full of old tasting grease. The French fries weren't seasoned and my drink was Luke warm. I almost paid 10 dollars for the meal! It was a waste of money and time."}
{"text":"This food truck is GREAT! The wings are really good and are a good size. Tax is included in their prices and they have great combo deals. They aren't expensive, but don't expect a 50 cent wing kind of deal. The food comes out hot and fresh. Their staff is very friendly, I'm always greeted with a smile. Their mambo sauce is AMAZING! Even better than the mambo sauce in the DMV area! The pizza was good, but not much different than any other pizza I've had.  The only thing I hope they improve on is operating outside of lunch hours. Now that they sell mambo sauce online, I've even got out of town friends dying for some!"}
