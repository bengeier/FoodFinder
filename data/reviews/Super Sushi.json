{"text":"We were so excited to try this place because it is right by our house. We were really excited because the restaurant environment is really nice and well presented, the server was nice (but slow), and the poke salad started off pretty good. However, once we ordered our nigiri, we were no longer impressed. Tuna was old (couldn't even eat it all), and all others were just unimpressive. We didn't even like the japanese lasagna, which is hard to mess up. Mediocre at best...although we do appreciate the effort... Save your money unless you have low standards."}
{"text":"It's a very tasty sushi spot. The sashimi is delicious. Their Spiderman roll has lots of different flavors. I recommend this restaurant."}

Our server Danny is very nice, friendly man, he serve us with full passion, we really enjoy the dinner"}
{"text":"Tbh I use to enjoy coming here it's been almost 35 minutes and I still haven't gotten any of my order. There are just 3 tables here..."}
{"text":"Awesome staff, awesome food, Deni, Bo, Paul, super awesome team sushi, GO!! Eating all you can eat seared sushi and vegetarian meals for my vegan friend.  And so tasty, never knew that this place existed and very clean as well. Excellent service"}
{"text":"I have to say the food here is TERRIBLE. The tuna was so not fresh. I just finished eating here and I'm worry that I'm going to have food poisoning honestly. The masago was soooo bad. It has a slimey -just a wrong- taste. 

The service can be better too. When I was seated at the bar, it was 10 to 15 being ignored by the chef. So I had to ask \" do I order with you?\" (Which I know the answer is yes, since the waiter told me I need to order the sushi with the chef)

The 20% check in discount was ok. Honestly I won't  be back here again even if they offer me money. 

The sushi rice was wrong. Way too soft and the ratio of fish and rice was all about rice. Not great. The garlic tuna was like yucky. I almost barf  Tuna tasted like it's the cheapest quality and had been seating there for a month or so. The same with the sashimi salad. 

The salt and pepper calamari is a joke. 

Won't come back."}
{"text":"Been craving sushi for the longest and decided to try a new spot, I was a bit skeptical because there's not that many reviews but it's new so I still came in for lunch. The waitress was really nice and awesome, but we did have to wait a while for our rolls but, honestly most sushi places you go to you have to wait a while for the sushi rolls, my thing is it better be a good roll, and indeed it was I felt like it was delicious sushi and it was made right I got the dragon roll, white tuna nigiri , tiger roll, miso soup and edamame and I got all you can eat for lunch for 21$ which is the typical pr. I will be coming back, they have great friendly staff and good sushi definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"We just eat here and we really enjoyed. The Chef was good and waitress very polite and lovely. Almost everything we tried was tasty."}

{"text":"Sunday 05/20/18... 6 reviews???  My wife got off of work and when she arrived home, she told me about this Sushi restaurant in the Spring Valley area Super Sushi and she wanted to give it a try. I mean we have eaten at just about every sushi restaurant in town and we had our favorite or so we thought. When we arrived we noticed only a few patrons eatting so we were a little apprehensive but hungar prevailed so we were seated by a very courteous and professional waiter named Wade. We looked over the menu and decided we would eat our usuals Nigiri salmon, tuna, super white. and yellow tail. Hand rolls, cut rolls,  and miso soup for starters baked green mussels, tochi (jalapeno popper), and mushroom balls love em'. The shushimi featured 2 pieces of each yellow tail, tuna, and salmon absolutely the freshest seafood we've eaten in any of our usual locales. The knife skill of the sushi chef was excellent it probably helps when you love what you do. We will be back and very often. Don't forget the fried ice cream for dessert. Oh, if you go in before 05/31/18 buy 1 get 2nd at half price..."}
{"text":"Recently opened near the house, smelled amazing. Awesome service from our host and the gentleman making our food. Made us laugh a couple times. Second time here, definitely going to come a third!"}
{"text":"We are coming back!  The setting is nice and extra clean.  My favorite is the spider man roll.  We haven't tried dessert.  Maybe next time.  We are full!"}
{"text":"Hard to rate this place.  Things were either really good or kind of bad.  Here is what I mean.  Once we place our food order, it took forever to come out.  There were only 5 people dining in the restaurant and 1 person making all of the sushi.  But the waiters were super good and paid a lot of attention to the customers.

Appetizers:
tochi - stuffed jalapenos, oh my god this thing is delicious!!
soft shell crab - nice to see soft shell crab as an appetizer
salt & pepper calamari - this wasn't that great
mushroom ball - holy smokes was this good!  a must try item!!!
seaweed salad - pretty standard, refreshing and tasty
baked green muscles - on par with other AYCE sushi places

Nigiri:
tuna - on par with other AYCE sushi places
yellowtail - on par with other AYCE sushi places
salmon - on par with other AYCE sushi places

Basic rolls:
negi hamachi - on par with other AYCE sushi places
spicy tuna - on par with other AYCE sushi places

Specialty rolls:
Sexy Baby - pretty tasty 
Super roll - very tasty no rice roll

The tochi and mushroom ball were my favorite items during this meal.  I'd go back to this place just to eat those 2 items alone.  As far as the nigiri goes, you get a good fish to rice ration.  The fish quality is the same as most other AYCE sushi places in town.  I'd come back and try more of the menu, and more tochi + mushroom balls."}
{"text":"Excellent food & Service 
I'm surprised not a lot of people are here Today

20% off all you can eat! Can't beat that !"}
{"text":"I tried so many different sushi restaurant, but this one I won't back here. Sushi rice wasn't cook well, fish is not fresh ! Definitely not return...."}
{"text":"There's a great vibe here, the customer service was great, and food came out quickly. One stand out item was the baked green mussels! Everything was very fresh, I don't know why people are saying it wasn't. They were able to accommodate our large party of 16 with kids and babies."}
{"text":"All you can eat includes extreme fillers added to your rolls. I haven't eaten here more than once, and I got all you can eat, but if I'd paid the al a cart price I'd be much more dissatisfied. 

Don't make tons of rice and veggies the major ingredients. Sushi is fish after all."}
{"text":"Excellent service. We enjoyed the selection of sushi. They were also very accommodating for kids and had a kids price. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Delicious Food, Nice Environment, Good Service made us a wonderful weekend Branch. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Just left the super sushi restaurant and am totally impressed and excited to have this place close by. The lunch combo is incredible. A perfect mix and the right amount to fill you at a smoking great price. The 99 cent daily special is such a nice touch. The sushi was top quality and delicious. Will definitely be coming back, and soon!!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open for months now. I was getting tired of driving out to spring mt. For sushi. I'm not a fan of Goyemon either, which is the closest sushi spot to my house. 
I'm definitely going to be a regular here"}
{"text":"Came here to try their all you can eat dinner because it was 20% off and it was right by my place. It was $26.95 for all you can eat dinner. I would say the price is pretty expensive for the menu that they offer. It wasn't as much items on the all you can eat menu compare to other places. I think if they want to charge that price they need to add more items to menu otherwise people will go to other places. The chef was really nice and he made me a cucumber roll that wasn't on the menu. It was really delicious. The uni was delicious as well. I enjoyed the sushi nigiri here. I wish they had a cucumber salad here. I had to order the seaweed salad which I like came with cabbage. I asked for a water with lemon  but they only had limes. Lol. 
Overall I enjoyed the food here but I definitely think they can improve and grow here."}
{"text":"Good service and great food and the the people was on top of get the sushi out quickly. Don't miss out on this place before it get to busy."}
{"text":"The sushi was good and tasted very fresh. Staff was friendly and helpful with making changes to the rolls. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food is great and service was excellent. Lots of new sushi to try. The location is great too. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Big ass bowl of Ramen, with tons of meat, but the price is McDonald 
You can have AYCE sushi for about $27"}
{"text":"Great new spot....fresh fish and I must say cleanest spot I've seen yet. Got to try the mushroom balls...and especially the tuna."}
{"text":"I don't how to rate this restaurant. The service are really good. The server pays a lot of attention on customers. However, Things are not fresh. I had sushi in this restaurant a few days ago, and I end up threw up at home. I never try any sushi like this. For me, I will never go to this restaurant anymore. Also if they promise you for discount which if you leave a good review on Yelp. Make sure you check for the detail."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Im super sushi picky and the owners were amazing and the staff was A+"}
{"text":"I love this place. Always clean and always fresh.. the owners are so nice and always attend to you with great customer service"}
{"text":"Was looking for a sushi place on my lunch break and saw this place with a grand opening sign, upon walking in I was greeted by a nice gentleman and immediately noticed how new and clean everything was. Awesome big screen TVs and a sushi bar. Menu has great prices and lots of different items to choose from. I'm very satisfied and I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Our first time here, the waitress is very friendly & the food is delicious I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Employees are very attentive and the restaurant is really clean! Seaweed salad is amazing! Can't wait to try the rest of my food! Also try the salt and pepper chicken... sooo good!"}
{"text":"Finally,THE best ayce sushi in town. Great quality, fresh,skilfully cut fish!! The rolls are exquisitely executed,their sauces are perfectly balanced with different ingredients.My husband and I are tremendously impressed. The freshness is as just caught from the ocean. The quality is as served in the high dollar casino resturants with a fair price. The knifing skill is clean and brilliant. The plating is appetizingly appealing, it made all the photos unjustified. With icing on the top of this BIG CAKE----grand opening till May 31---buy one ayce get the second 1/2 off. Did we get a great deal?!!! HA!HA!And there comes top server Wade with a stamp card. We know we'll fill that card up pretty quick."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying the service here was great they were attentive and quick.  The sushi chef was engaging and cheerful.  The unagi and saba nigiri were awesome definitely some of the best in town.  The bad part is the other nigiri were blah nice sizes but no taste to them.  The chauchu bowl was very good nice pork belly with rice.  The tochi appetizer is jalapeno stuffed with crab and breaded then deep fried very good.  They also have soft shell crab with no limit and those were also good. They also have lunch specials there which were priced pretty reasonable.  The next time we go will probably be for lunch and their special and pass on their ayce for sushi. Remember to check in on Yelp you get a 20 percent discount when checking in."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, and really enjoyed it! We are very picky about our sushi restaurants, especially all you can eat, and Super Sushi was great. The fish was fresh, the rolls were yummy, and the service was good! The restaurant is also very clean and has a nice atmosphere. We will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, family friendly, the food is amazing, cozy and quiet, very personal and respectful treatment by the servers, a lot of food to choose. I'm very happy and I will Def come back again!"}
