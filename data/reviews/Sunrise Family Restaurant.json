{"text":"My wife and I ate here for breakfast one morning after about two weeks of living in Stoughton. The experience wasn't what I would call the best. The waitress was one of those annoyed old school types that scoffs if you ask the wrong question; like anything to do with gluten, egg whites or asking for a substitution. We also got weird looks when we asked for a plain egg scrambled for our 14 month old son. We had brought in some fruit for him as well and she eyed us like we were stealing from them. The food was average, not great and the restaurant was full of what I can only describe as peaked, backwoods Arkansas types. Basically rednecks in cut off shirts with too much body mass and too many kids screaming throughout the meal. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Love the Eggs Benedict! The food is great and a great value. Good local spot. Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"It isgood for breakfast but not too hot for lunch.  I may have gave it four stars but the bathrooms are not too clean."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but the wait staff is soooo nice.  I haven't had a bad meal there, but it is one of those places that could be hit or miss.  Give it a try.  I think you will like it!"}
{"text":"I have been here dozens of times. I LOVE the food!! The service is awesome - I love the family that owns the place. Their breakfast food is my favorite!"}
{"text":"i went to visit Wisco last week- an unexpected little trip- but i found myself in Wisco with hubby and my Wisco family. hubby needed a haircut and in the same plaza was this little Sunshine Family Restaurant. we went in and it felt cozy. i think we were the youngest people there, i thought to myself, \"this was definitely a place to find a deal! aehehehe.\"   as i was going through the menu- i was surprised to find a gyro breakfast! :) Ooooooh! gyro meat with eggs and home cooked potatoes? sounded a little too good to be true. mMMmmmmMm! tasty! why no one had thought of this before- i don't know- but it was so yummy! came with toast, some shaved gyro meat (lamb), eggs, jam and of course.. you can't have a gyro yummy without some cucumber sauce! all i can say is YUM!   what a nice and unexpected change from the usual breakfast sausage, bacon or ham. the thing i really love about gyros- is just the scrumptious flavor- and a bite of egg, jam, gyro and some cucumber sauce- perfection. don't forget to then take a bite of your home cooked potatoes!   to drink i got the hot chocolate- won't say much there, just that i loved it. perfect, whip creamy goodness. :)   if you don't feel as adventurous as i am for breakfast (hehehehe) you can always get something more normal- the gyro plate that i got was probably the most exotic thing on the menu- everything else seemed like good ol' Americano breakfasts. my husband got the biscuits and gravy- he lapped it up to say the least... so did i! :) i took a few bites... hey- it's what a foodie wife does! :)   if you're in the Stoughton area- check it out! :) it's an old fashioned place with friendly service. :) you also can't go wrong with a home cooked breakfast for two for $20. :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great value and great spot for anyone looking to feed the family without spending every dollar they have in their wallet. Our family LOVES Sunrise and is our default establishment when eating out in town. Fantastic daily specials and a huge menu that should satisfy everyone at the table. Breakfast is AMAZING and is served all day. This really is a gem in Stoughton. Their cheesesteak is great, amazing kids meals and pie, pie, pie! Owners value every customer and it shows."}
{"text":"We have been here a dozen times or so for breakfast. The servers are always friendly and helpful. We have always gotten exactly what we ordered and it's been good and hot."}
{"text":"When we first moved to stoughton we stopped in. It took 20 minutes to get coffee and when we got our food it was luke warm and disgusting (breakfast and it  was a chickem fried steak special) we've never returned."}
{"text":"You could not pay me to eat here again!  The menu is easily over 50 items long and the service is just ok. It is definitely geared more for older folks you like there food bland and mushy. There really is nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"I just had a surprising and incredibly disappointing experience at one of my (formerly) favorite breakfast restaurants, the Sunrise Family Restaurant in Stoughton. The owner/cook humiliated my friend and I for sending food back that was way over-cooked (and not what we'd asked for). We (and the poor wait staff) were horrified when he screamed at me from the kitchen for wasting his food and refused to honor the order. The worst part - multiple people there who know the owner told us that had a man been at our table it would either have been done right the first time or fixed without complaint.  I was on my way to becoming a regular - I've been there at least a half dozen times in the past 8-10 weeks. I was with my friend who has been going there at least twice a week for over two years. I will not ever be going back, and at this point she isn't planning to any time soon."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kiddo. I remember when it opened!   I was here just last week with my dad for dinner. I hadn't been in for quite some time, so I was looking forward to it.   Diner food, prepared consistently well. I always get breakfast. The serve it all day (bonus!). I went with the eggs and french toast meal, with a side of sour dough toast (for dipping in the eggs, of course!) and bacon. Everything was cooked perfectly and it was delish.   Good prices, lots of options, and incredibly friendly staff. I am a fan!"}
