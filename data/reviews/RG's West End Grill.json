{"text":"Fantastic! Best breakfast and lunch in Gastonia. Home cooked specials every day. Went there the other day to try the meatloaf and will be back for more. Used to go to Firestone grill almost every day but haven't been back since this place opened."}
{"text":"There aren't too many other good breakfast options in the area.  Lots of choices and all for an extremely reasonable price.  I met a couple well known foodies here for breakfast before a pretty important meeting down the street.  I wanted to make sure we were all on the same page coming in, so figured breakfast at a major intersection would be the easiest bet.  I got the pork tenderloin breakfast, the guy beside me got the ribeye.  Both were thin and a little overdone IMO, but better than what I expected for the money.  The eggs were good, biscuits as well.  All in all, a good meal."}
{"text":"RG's went out of business and was replaced a couple years ago by Ball's.  It's an \"order at the counter/have a seat\" kinda place complete with all things Styrofoam--plates, cups, and silverware.    While the service was good, the food hot, and delivered quickly, the grits and livermush were low quality.  Cheap stuff.  The place needs a thorough scrubbing, fresh paint, and a touch of home for me to return."}
{"text":"Both times that the office has eaten here it was GREAT and was busy with people enjoying cook to order home made southern cooking! Great specials and great prices! The only fall out is it closes at 3 but opens at 6 for breakfast. Can't comment on breakfast but the lunch is amazing!"}
{"text":"Omg! Fast service but lousy service & food. The food was totally full of grease and French fries for breakfast? Powdered cream? Seriously? My first and last time. Don't do it."}
