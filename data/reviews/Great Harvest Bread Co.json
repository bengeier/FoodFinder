{"text":"Such good bread and local jams and preserves. The employees are super nice and helpful. I love it here! Their cinnamon swirl and challa bread are to die for."}
{"text":"Cheddar garlic bread is the best. They bake it only Mondays. They open from 7 am to 6 pm based on their website. Open hours on Yelp is wrong."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty, healthy, affordable, creative options for bread, bowls, salads, and sweets. Friendly fast service and quiet space to enjoy with parking and convenient location. Great little spot."}
{"text":"While I can't speak to the sandwiches, this is the best place to buy bread in Pittsburgh. Selection varies, but the cheddar beer bread and the cinnamon bread are standouts. The bread rolls are also strong. The price is higher but well worth it"}
{"text":"Fantastic bread. The popeye bread is addictive (spinach, parm & asiago cheese baked into a crack loaf!). I can easily eat half a loaf without any accompaniment! When I make a sandwich, I often tear the bread out and eat it alone, just to savor its flavor purely. The savory scones are also really appreciated, as I often enjoy non-sweet options in my bakery pursuits."}
{"text":"Ok, so bread is not my thing, I love bread, but I really haven't eaten much in the past, ohhh 10 years. I tried the orange bread, a potato bread with wheat and white flour, Popeye bread, and a multigrain blend. I really really liked the Popeye!!  It had spinach and cheese in it and was to die for.   Great Bread!"}
{"text":"Amazing foods and tasty treats!  The samples are yummy good plus the ppl are so friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Best bread ever! Doesn't matter which loaf you buy, every single kind is outrageously satisfying!! You must go here and try the sandwiches, soup, the breads, and one thing you shouldn't miss is the salted caramel oatmeal cookies.  Theres not a cookie like,it anywhere and its insane!!   I'm a die hard foody and I highly recommend this place. The service is top notch, they make you feel like youre sitting at  a family table or friends table, you are made to feel special and cared about. Please take my advice and try this place out. You will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I visited last month, early in the morning - okay, about 830. I went without coffee on a rainy Saturday and looked for coffee in Trader Joe's and for some reason, they did not have any out. I asked the nice cashier about the coffee, but that Great Harvest has some and it's really good, and they give you bread also!  So upon her recommendation, I visited Great Harvest, and the coffee was really really good. Something else though peaked my interest \"breakfast rollups\".  Picture a crescent roll, unbaked,  and layer in a fried egg, some bacon or ham, and cheese, roll it up, and bake for a few minutes - well, that's what I had and it was very good, and it was already warm.  They also offered me some freshly baked bread - I think it was cinnamon. I bought a loaf of Dakota to take home.  They also have wifi.  If Great Harvest were near me, I would be there a lot.  The man I presume is the owner or manager is very friendly."}
{"text":"I discovered this chain when I was in college. The Farmhouse White is exquisite. I re-discovered it when I lived in Pittsburgh (but they closed :() & Virginia. Now I see another Pittsburgh location & I'm dying to go!"}
{"text":"I tasted the cinnamon chunk raisin bread today it was so fresh and heavenly..!!  I bought it immediately even though I'm not a big fan of baked food."}
{"text":"Place has really gone downhill by this latest experience. Ordered a simple chicken salad on white bread at 11:30 am. It was a comedy of errors beginning with the staff talking to each other about someone running all the hot water out. Another woman came in to pick up a special order that hadn't been done. The card reader wouldn't take credit cards, the coffee was out, they made the sandwich on wheat instead of white, the pepper shaker was empty and there was only one in the room, and most of the chicken salad, which was supposed to have artichoke heart, was inedible because some one included the tough outer leaves. I like this place. I really do, but on this day (I tried to treat my wife to lunch) they dropped the ball. To be fair they very graciously refunded the cost of lunch. Bravo to them for that. I reviewed this place in the past at 4 stars. Today not so much."}
{"text":"Big fan of artisan bread. Went in and got the Breakfast Blast. Tasted mildly sweet and moist.  Compared to other artisan bakeries in town (five points Artisan, Allegro hearth) Great harvest is on the same level despite being a chain. In terms of Taste and service, 4 stars!! Unfortunately, I gave it a 3 stars because this place is extremely expensive (should be $$$). All breads that day cost 7-8 dollars for a loaf (Breakfast Blast cost 7.65). For a student budget, taste did not justify paying 8 dollars for a medium-size loaf of bread."}
{"text":"They sell an assortment of freshly baked breads, cookies, and other desserts as well as making sandwiches to order. Bags of various mixes including trail mix (\"Pittsburgh Pothole Crunch), brownie mix, and pancake mix are also available. They also sell some Penn's Corner CSA items including their delicious (and expensive salsa).   I can vouch for the oatmeal cookies which are delicious. The Port Authority (portobello veggie sandwich, and the Baja turkey were both good. Service is a bit slow, but they're new so I imagine it will improve with time."}
{"text":"I'm glad my sister suggested this place, from the signage and strip mall I would have thought this was some Panera-like chain, but its just a delicious and basic deli with amazing bread and healthy food."}
{"text":"Great Harvest is warm and welcoming, and I don't think you will find a better loaf of handmade bread anywhere.  They use great recipes, hand crafted techniques, and all fresh ingredients from scratch.  I took home a loaf that was made with sesame seeds, and it was delicious.   I had no idea this store was a chain, however I noticed it only by visiting their website.  I recognized the owner from having met him at a Yelp event at the Children's Museum, so I stopped for a friendly chat.    You should give their bread a try, I'm a believer.  They are quite convenient to my weekly shopping trip to Trader Joe's, so I'll be making a regular stop there."}
{"text":"Okay so this review is based on the people working tonight 3 people on and nobody else in the place with us we ordered three sandwiches and some drinks a bar and a loaf Togo. My 14 month old I got ham and provolone they could not understand the concept of changing the cheese to provolone from Swiss. Then it took forever for her to cash is out and even longer for us to get our food . Man I'm so disappointed in. The staff we come here often and service tonight was slow and unorganized food ended up being good so that saved tonight review for three stars they are usually a 5 star place. Next time will be better hopefully"}
{"text":"This is our weekly bread shop - we always get a loaf of the Dakota, but we also love the Breakfast Blast, cinnamon Raisin and honey whole wheat loaves. We don't miss German bread because of the wonderful bread we et here at Great Harvest! Tom and his team are always super nice and ready to help in any way. Ask him how he started the business - it's a real interesting story guided by his passion for good bread! If you appreciate really pure, fresh, good bread, you'll love this place! Also try their oatmeal raisin cookie and blueberry cream cheese scone. Super yummy!"}
{"text":"So I think Great Harvest just re-opened with new management cause it seemed they were closed for a while. I have to deduct a point cause my sandwich --the turkey Chile cheddar melt--wasn't quite spicy enough and the sauce kinda drowned out the spice that was there. It was good though. I can't also get this place to 4 stars cause everything I've had from here, even under old management has been just a bit short of \"damn that was good\" or 4 stars.   I do completely recommend this place though, as a sit down lunch, or to go. Definitely get their breads."}
{"text":"I use to live near a Great Harvest in Colorado, and it was amazing. I have been to this one probably four times since it opened, and every time I wonder why I came back."}
{"text":"Great bread staff fights like school kids. Lady that makes sandwiches bullys the staff. I don't want to support this behavior"}
{"text":"Awesome super fresh bread! Friendly staff and the girl with the tats and piercings is a babe!"}
{"text":"Food is good.  I've enjoyed everything I have ordered here.  Don't love the customer service. Aside from when the owner serves me, I'm made to feel like ordering sandwich to go is the biggest inconvenience I could ask of the staff, especially after 5:30."}
{"text":"My family and I discovered this bakery a few years ago down in Virginia and I was so excited when I heard I had one close to me. Sadly, it did not live up to the other one. The one I visited in Virginia had a lot more varieties of the loafs of bread which is the main reason I was disappointed with this location. I remember seeing about 7 different specialty daily flavors that I wanted to try at the Virginia location but of course I don't live close enough nor do I have the space for that much bread or the time to stop there everyday for a week to get all the flavors. One of the biggest sellers at the VA location and one of our favorites is the apple scrapple and sadly this location didn't have it :( I did get a loaf of the honey wheat and it was delicious but overall I wish they had more varieties like some of the other locations."}
{"text":"I ate the majority of an entire loaf of golden cheddar bread on Saturday; sans butter! I think that says it all.   The cinnamon chip scones and cookies are pretty darn good too!"}
{"text":"Ordered sandwiches to cater a party. The food was great- guests asked where the sandwiches were from. They were super flexible for all our allergy, schedule, and last minute add on requests.  Mr he cookies are HUGE and fantastic- especially the salted caramel.  Guests were loving them -  my favorite sandwich was the chicken salad."}
{"text":"So hubby and I were in a mood for a nice tasty sandwich and soup and decided to hit this place up, especially after having their tasty breads at the Un Wine Yelp event.  Anyway, this place is tucked in the same shopping center as Trader Joe's and behind the McDonald's, so its a little hidden.   The place is pretty clean and well laid out. I really liked that they displayed art by local artists on their wall. They also have a weekly bread menu of the variety of breads they bake.   Initially, I had no idea what to get, but was advised by the attendant to try out the Roast Beef and Provolone sandwich, which was amazing. I also had it with their house whole wheat. The nice thing about this place is that you can pick out just about any bread they have for your sandwich which is pretty awesome. I also had a taste of the chimichurry roast beef, which was pretty tasty. I really thought this sandwich was going to be really spicy, since that is why I didn't order it, but it was really good.   We also ordered the soup of the day which was pretty good. It was a nice chicken and kale soup, that was really citrucy. I really liked it.   Anyway, overall great service, and excellent sandwiches. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"My 3-yr-old son told me it was the best PB&J he'd ever had :) And my husband barely said two worlds as he wolfed down with roast beef.   But I had looked on the website and found something that wasn't listed on the menu board: Fresh sliced smoked ham and granny smith apples topped with warm brie and an apricot honey dijon spread on Dakota bread (sunflower, pumpkin, and sesame seeds in honey whole wheat dough). This panini style sammich tops my list for deliciousness.  Our lunches wouldn't have been complete without old school Coke in a bottle and a fantastic of kettle chips.  Our lunch for three was a bit on the pricey side (over $30); however, I would pay it again in a heartbeat! Forget about Panera! Go to Bakery Square and get one of the best sammiches in the 'Burgh - and served by some of the friendliest staff around."}
{"text":"Phenomenal quality. The breads are excellent and everything on the sandwiches was so fresh, so crisp, and so flavorful.  We had the roast beef and the Italian and were blown away.  How can something as simple as a sandwich be so good? The answer is fresh, quality everything.  You can tell that the owner just loves to bake, he enjoys his craft, and is quite good at it.  This is the best sandwich shop in town and is definitely worth making a special trip for."}
{"text":"I stopped by here to pick up some \"good bread\" to take to a potluck.  I was expecting to find thick, just baked crusty breads with a variety of flavors like I've seen at other bakeries including at Whole Foods, Market District Giant Eagles, and my favorite Zingerman's Bakehouse in Ann Arbor, MI.  I assumed by name only that Great Harvest would have such breads and was greatly disappointed to find that they were all soft loaves and while there were a few interesting flavors they didn't even have any hearty breads like a 7-grain with seeds throughout.  Since I wasn't going to have time to stop elsewhere before I went to the party, I purchase 2 loaves - the honey wheat and the jalapeno cheddar.  I tried a slice of the jalapeno cheddar with my salad at lunch and it a bit too salty and the flavors tasted artificial rather than natural, particularly the cheese - it reminded me of processed velvetta or cheez wiz neither of which I have eaten since I was a young child, and the texture was too soft.  Not at all what I wanted.  Clearly, it's a personal preference for me that I associate \"good\" i.e. expensive bread with the just baked crusty, chewy full of flavor (other than just lots of salt), and for me, it would be one thing if they had a mix of soft and crusty breads, but this was all soft and therefore not many options from which to choose.    I also found the employees to be distracted - another employee kept interrupting the other employee who was waiting on me which I found rude given that there were no other customers in the store, and the person waiting on me continued to stop getting my order ready because she was stopping to listen to her coworker.    My review is really 2.5 stars, but to be fair, I gave them 3 stars given that the bread isn't awful, just not what I was looking for.  I will not be back if only because I have higher expectations of what I want on the rare occasion that I do eat/buy bread which is only a couple of times a year.  I'm sure that it's great for what it is but it definitely isn't a place that sells products that I want to spend my hard earned money on."}
