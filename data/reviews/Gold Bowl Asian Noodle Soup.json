{"text":"Order beef pho, pork vermicelli, fried pork and rice and fruit slushie. Paid $33.50 plus tip.  The good:  Good portion, good flavour (not salty at all), new and good decor, good service.   The bad:  Ordered pork vermicelli but the noodle they use is the same as the pho soup.  I know what vermicelli looks like as i often go to vietnamese restaurant. And when we came there were 3-4 teenager playing cards while others are dining and they are a bit tad noisy. Foremost; it is a place to eat and not a play ground. They should not allow them to play if they want customers to keep coming back.   Its a good and affordable place to eat as we live near by but wont be coming back if they didn't do anything about those teenagers hanging out for more than 2 hours and let them play cards."}
{"text":"Had medium pho ($6.99), noodles were alright and so was the beef.  Soup was full of msg though, could've been better.  Came here for a quick lunch and didn't expect much since the other customers were fellow students there for lunch.   It was a bit weird when she asked me if I would be using the bean sprouts, lime and basil before I even got to my food...it was as though they would be reusing the same bowl for everyone if the previous person didn't use it.    A bit overpriced considering the quality and other locations that offer better pho  Service was poor, I had to go up to them to get the bill because no one would come around to check if we needed anything."}
{"text":"If you're going to serve ramen, then you better make the noodles right!!! I didn't mind that the proteins were blend or that the stock was lacking, but if the noodles are bad, then the whole bowl falls apart.  There \"real fruit juices\" are more sugar and favouring.   They might as well serve me instant ramen with kool aid."}
{"text":"2.5 Star  If you just want to have a quick meal and want to stuff yourself with noodles for a reasonable price, Gold Bowl Asian Noodle Soup is definitely a good choice.  Menu here is really simple: Vietnamese Pho, Vermicelli or Ramen from 6.99 and up. There are also snacks and drinks if you want something light.  Special House Pho Medium ($6.99) is quite sizable with a lot of noodle but not enough meat?! Broth though heavily in MSG, I feeling the thirsty now after 30 minute after eating that noodle.  Happy Hour 20% off all snacks.  Free Wifi  Parking might be hard as the lot is always busy!  But if you are sensitive to MSG, I suggest you to pass on this place. But seems like a lot of young people like to indulge on carbs and MSG as this place was quite busy for lunch."}
