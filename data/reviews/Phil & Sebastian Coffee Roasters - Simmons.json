{"text":"So many events have happened at this venue since the Calgary Municipal Land Corporation took ownership of it and have pumped resources into developing the East Village.

Some examples:  Open Air August where movies were shown on the side of the building over the summer courtesy of YYC Mobile Movie, Calgary Mini Maker Faire, free yoga lessons and so much more.

The interior event space is gorgeous and very versatile, and it's obvious that they've put a lot of money into restoring the building.

The space is available to be booked for various events, although eventually CMLC hopes to turn it into retail and restaurant space.  I can't wait to see who ends up moving in there, and think it would be fabulous to have a restaurant that overlooks the Bow River.  Until that happens, keep an eye on their event calenders and enjoy the venue!"}
{"text":"Pretty much everything you could want in a high-end coffee shop: a variety of ethical, single source coffees brewed in various ways, a small selection of fine pastries (which you can supplement with wares from the co-located Sidewalk Citizen Bakery), a beautifully restored warehouse milieu, and a riverside patio. I love coffee, but it often disagrees with my stomach...this is the kind of place you can talk to the barista about acidity levels, brew time, etc.. The only downside is its popularity of this place, meaning you might need to wait a while for that magic cup of Joe."}
{"text":"While seating may be limited, it's easy to see why. I don't live in East Village but every time I go, I understand a little bit more about what it's like to live there. Residents of the nearby condos are fortunate to be able to stroll to their favourite coffee shop to catch up over a latte and even enjoy a delectable dessert. Groups of friends and family gather at the large wooden tables and stay for a while. 

The feel of this particular coffee shop is unlike any other. Most of that is due to the building itself. Visitors to the Simmons Building have the choice of three different companies: Sidewalk Citizen Bakery, Phil & Sebastian's and Charbar. The warehouse features an open concept that encourages the intersection of these three businesses and intermingling as well. This kind of atmosphere feels fitting for a coffee shop such as Phil & Sebastian's and wouldn't quite fit the bill if it was a Starbucks or other large international chain.

Being a history buff, I love how these three businesses came together to utilize this beautiful old building and bring character and modernity to this historic site."}
{"text":"Had a tea latte here, too weak for my taste. But very friendly and knowledgeable staff about their products. Went in with a friend that is lactose intolerant and made sure the barista knew that and the barista said the sweetener they used (dulce de leche) had dairy and if my friend wanted it omitted from the drink."}
{"text":"Went for morning coffee! Good ambience and great coffee!
This is my first visit and I was pleasantly surprised at how good the coffee was."}
{"text":"This place has the biggest, fluffiest lattes in big cups you can wrap your hands around.

Awesome place to pop in for a coffee if you are wandering around the St. Patrick's island area; especially in the winter.

Wait can be long if busy, but it's worth it for the fluffy foam.

{"text":"Inside the stunning, retro fitted, old Simmons mattress factory located in the now buzzing east village, rest the best coffee in Calgary and probably in Alberta at the very least. Phil&Sebastian are 2 engineers who stumbled upon a coffee book and decided to make the perfect cut. (Read the story on their webpage) They control the whole supply chain and work with farmers abroad to ensure the products they recive is the best. Every one of their employee is highly trained, you will get a constant amazing cup of coffee. Never, will you drink an other Starbucks. If you ever buy their beans, you will notice their colour is uniform and so is their size. I have tried other coffee beans at home, some very well known and nothing is as consistent as Phil & Sebastien. Beware! You will be addicted, then next thing you know you will be spending thousands on coffee equipment at home.  All in vain, they use the top equipments available in the commercial market and none of the household stuff comes close to the quality of their appliances. I hope I have awaken you taste buds now. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"They STEEP their tea! 

My first time at a coffee/tea shop in Calgary and I'm so surprised that they don't just stick in a tea bag and pour in some hot water. No. They actually steep it in a pot and give that to you! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"love coming here! they make the best coffee and the customer service is superb :) I recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Probably one of the coolest coffee shops I've been to in Calgary. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Searching for tasty caffeination in a memorable location? Look no further.

Phil & Sebastian is located steps away from the beautiful Bow River in the restored Simmons Mattress Factory, buzzing with activity from the neighboring restaurant and bakery. Even the P&S roasting happens in this appropriately industrial space.

The baristas are friendly, fast, and successful in making tasty beverages! I ordered an Iced Latte and my husband tried the Black & Tonic - a cold brew with tonic water and hints of cherry. My latte was great, but obviously not as exciting and interesting as my husband's choice... Jealous? Yes.

I love it when a shop can take coffee seriously but still have fun with experimental flavors and twists!"}
{"text":"No Wifi networks worked at all and I paid $5 for a premade, boxed Tazo iced chai tea."}
{"text":"My favourite Coffee in town. They make the most delicious lattes and always do my Americano Misto just right .. even my toddler likes it (when she sneaks a sip)! Sometimes the service and energy of staff is a little less than average, however, the coffee makes up for it ;)"}
{"text":"drip coffee was excellent. savory scone was alright. lots of seating to stay and enjoy the coffee and scone."}
{"text":"Interesting place to be sure. Set up for drink ordering is a little tight right off the main entrance of the front of the building. Love the look of the mod bar set up. Second coffee bar I have been too that utilizes those. Ordered 12oz mocha quad shot and a flat white. Mocha was so so, probably would not order that one again. The flat white was very good, well balanced. Presentation of both very nice.  My husband and I are just in town seeing the sights, but will be back here again to soak up the atmosphere and enjoy a few more espresso creations!"}
{"text":"Very good coffee, great location, and located in a unique old building.  Definitely would come here again."}
{"text":"Coffee here is really milky.  Service is quick and friendly and I love the location and really wanted to enjoy the coffee but it essentially tasted like flavored milk."}
{"text":"Great service with a smile.  Wonderful atmosphere that is inviting. Found the london fogs we ordered to be watered down though, not sure if its type of tea they use. And they do not serve donuts at this location."}
{"text":"Was there today, and after getting a loaf of great red fife bread from the bakery, talked to one of the staff at Phil&Seb about the roast durations of their various beans. Picked up a bag of their espresso Honduras beans, knowing that they now are close to tops in Calgary for beans.

What they've done to the old Simmons building is quite cool, and as East Village finishes its last few condo buildings, the coffee, meat, resto and bakery can only flourish as people move in to the area and bring their upper-middle class sensibilities with them.

Try the beans, folks, but before purchasing do the usual smell test re. what your nose picks up, and ask the staff for what more you need to know. They are great.

As for the cafe, getting an almond croissant with a nice dark brew is just about the best treat in life."}
{"text":"Spacious, bright, and with as much charming character in the building as there is in their coffee - This P&S location is a brilliant addition to the Calgary coffee scene and to the East Village hood.

If you're not familiar with Phil & Sebastian coffee in general, you're in for a pleasant surprise. I'm no good at describing coffee, but I'm in love with the mellow tang that P&S coffee has. Stay away from the cream and sugar here and just drinking it straight.

The staff are super passionate about coffee. They live and breathe it (well, mostly they drink it - please do not try to breathe your coffee) and always seem passionate about exploring and keeping up with all the best coffees across the world. It always blows my mind how much care, consideration, and downright skill their team has at what is essentially putting beans in water. It sounds simple, but it's really really not and their attention do detail shines through in every single cup."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and unique combinations. Had their Black & Tonic. Really interesting flavor mixture and a fun exploration. Seemed like a higher end approach to coffee for those purists out there. :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday.  I had a flat white since they didn't make a \"latte\". It was good   Better than average."}
{"text":"Great place to stop in and grab a tea or coffee, I had never been to a Phil & Sebastians before working close to this location, but whenever I need an afternoon pick me up I head over. Service is usually pretty quick depending on the time of day, there's lots of communal setting in the space. The Hibiscus tea has always been my favourite item on the menu, nice blends and always comes in pretty colours. I would say to except to pay prices similar to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Went there on a chilly November Sunday and it was packed! Lot's of people, atmosphere is great. Lots of free parking on the street in the area (4 hour max). 

Ordered a large latte and it's probably one of the best I've had. It was perfect the perfect latte - great aroma, great taste - almost buttery smooth. 

Highly recommended. Also laptop friendly and saw a few people hang out with their laptops. 

In the same building there is also the Charbar restaurant and a bakery that you can check out too."}
{"text":"Amazing building in the East Village, I love the exposed brick and wooden pillars. Phil & Seb has a few locations in Calgary and the quality and consistency are the same across all locations.  This location is bumping on the weekends, I don't think there are that many coffee shops in the East Village and with more and more people living in the area it's clear that Phil & Seb is where many of them choose to start their weekends. Even with a long line, it moved quickly and the service was friendly. They also have a great selection of pastries and treats you can add to your coffee order."}
{"text":"Love supporting local businesses, great coffee and great staff! Also they have some amazing baked goods from sidewalk citizens, must try if you ask me."}
{"text":"The sweetest baristas you'll ever meet. We chatted with three of them regarding popular places to travel in the city and they were really helpful.

There's a steady WiFi connection and a bench that runs the entire length of the cafe if you don't want to sit in a chair.

P.S. - Try their snicker doodles and their award-winning coffee, they're awesome."}
{"text":"If there was a minus star review I would use it!! Coming from the US I was shocked to see the lack of customer service provided by the more than 4 people behind the counter! After a day of lifting spirits of a loved one who just lost his wife, we were without hesitation denied service and abruptly told \"we close at 4, sooooory\" I looked at my phone and it literally just turned 4PM. Note: These pretensions coffee roasters close at 3:59"}
{"text":"Happy 100th anniversary Simmons Building! Yet another thing in Calgary that dates back to 1912. During WWII, it manufactured bedding for the military.

The Simmons Building is at the heart of the riverwalk in the East Village. Offices in the front and a large open area in the back, it'd make for a lovely event space. It just so happened it was an outdoor food truck event space today. The interior has a hardwood floor and exposed brick walls. Add a few twinkling lights and you've got yourself some atmosphere!

For large events, parking can be a bit tricky in the area. Mostly, you'll want to find pay parking on the street or make your way over from Inglewood."}
{"text":"I definitely like the ambiance of this place. In particular I like that they just brew the coffee right in front of you. I think that is a cute little trick. Although I do wonder what they do during busy hours. Hopefully they have more than just the one staff member because I can see it getting very congested in there.

Interior is very trendy. Barista was chatty and sweet. I always like someone who will chat me up a little bit. She explained a bit about the history of the place and a few things on their menu.

I had a London Fog and it was good. Nothing to be blown away by but fine. There was A LOT of froth on it which I don't really like. But for all intents and purposes it was fine. The tables were almost full but we managed to find a seat!

I can see that a lot of people do work here! Makes sense to me! I would definitely consider coming here with my laptop and getting shit done."}
{"text":"Drove all this way for a coffee shop that is only a single $ yet it's more expensive then most $$ coffee shops.  $6.50 for a mocha?!"}
{"text":"If you suffer from loft envy, I wouldn't recommend going to Phil & Sebastian Coffee Roasters! 

The Simmons building is stunning with a New York City, industrial loft vibes. It is super spacious, bright and welcoming--which is definitely from our comforting Calgarian vibe! 

I am not much of a coffee drinker, but I do LOVE pastries, cookies and cake. Which works out perfectly because Sidewalk Citizen Bakery located in the building as well. I got the Peppermint Tea and it was great. Very flavourable and was at the perfect temperature! My tastebuds are very thankful for that. The prices are what you would expect from a high-end coffee shop, I paid $4.50 for my large tea.

Phil & Sebastian Coffee Roasters is a great place for meetings, parties, and dates. The space is large enough that you're not competing with other people's conversations around you or crowd noise pollution. I would love to come back here in the evening, grab a cup of tea or coffee and stroll around the neighborhood. 

If Phil & Sebastian Coffee Roasters is a preview of what the East Village is going to be like then I need to move there ASAP!"}
{"text":"Phil and Sebastian makes a killer cappuccino. Cool vibe here at the old Simmons building."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Also coming from the states, similar to the previous yelper, this is ridiculous. The only thing that the staff member said was \"do you want a receipt?\". That's it.  No hello, no nothing.  Not coming back again."}
{"text":"The ambience in the Simmons building is crafted quite well to the industrial loft vibe. The barista's are well informed and happy to share their knowledge at Phil & Sebastian's. I love the\"hanging\" tables with room for 6. With charbar in the same building it's easy to go from coffee to dinner."}
{"text":"While super busy on a Sunday morning, there probably isn't a better way to start your day in the city with your dog along the river. Located in the Simmons build along the river this amazing coffee shop is a must stop."}
{"text":"This new-old building is stunning with its new tenants.   The historic qualities have been maintained well, and it is enjoyable to check out the interior now.  Phil & Sebastian coffee, Charbar, and Sidewalk Citizen bakery are a complimentary trio that have seamlessly integrated into the beautiful brick building.   Bravo East Village, bravo."}
