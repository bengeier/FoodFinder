{"text":"I was in the mood for some seafood and what better place than a Portuguese restaurant. I started off with the chorizo and scallops which caught my eye as an unusual combination. It turns out that the two are made for each other - fantastic!!! Of the ample seafood selection, I chose the shrimp in Madeira sauce. It was excellent, but missed having some greens or vegetables with it.  The house red wine was excellent, but sadly forgot to ask what brand it was.  Finished the meal off with a cappuccino which was the perfect ending to a lovely meal."}
{"text":"We went to eat tapas, as we were not hungry and wanted to test out small dishes because of Yelp reviews. When we only ordered tapas the waiter was not the most delighted. Ordered grilled calamari which was good, and a grilled octupus. Waiter did not bring the octupus and brought us a duck breast instead, we did not eat if because of taste.

Overall I think there are better options nearby."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. I never would have expected the best meal we would have in Montreal to be Portuguese, but I was pleasantly surprised! The scallops and chorizo were fantastic, the atmosphere was lovely, and the staff was pleasant and very helpful. I would return in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I came across this restaurant unexpectedly while trying to decide what would be best for my final evening in Montreal. I had. Even wanting some Portuguese food as it is not common in the PNW that I am aware of. I walked upstairs to the restaurant and was kindly ushered in by the kind host/server and was surprised by the live music! There was live fado music and it was lovely. I ordered wine and food and it was all delicious. I loved the kale soup, which was perfectly warm and peppery and tasty on this rainy day. I had the chefs special-an entire fish-with veggies and rice. It was all so tasty and you could tell the ingredients were quality. All went beautifully and I hope to pop back in there again!"}
{"text":"Service: decent. Friendly waiter. 
Atmosphere: mostly touristy and kind of empty. 
Food: we ordered some drinks, the mussels, calamari and the grilled sardines. Food was mediocre at best. Mussels were ok. Calamari was chewy. The sardines were so salty they were basically inedible. We told the waiter and he stilled charged us for it. 
Bottom line, wouldn't come back and do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Outstanding all around -- food was delicious, service impeccable, atmosphere was quiet without being stuffy, music was an unexpected bonus. Reasonable prices, especially for Montreal. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was one of our favorite meals during our stay in Vieux-Port.  We enjoyed the kind of fine, formal service you just don't get anymore.  First rate meal at a very reasonable price.  The staff were absolutely charming, and provided excellent, professional service despite it being Friday night.  Our meal started with a basket of assorted breads and olives.  We enjoyed hot delicious soups and both enjoyed our fish dishes.  There was lovely live music and a decent beer and wine list.  The dining room is very nice; the table beautifully laid.  This was a rare treat and we will look forward to visiting again on our next trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Tasty and fresh seafood, excellent I should say. Friendly service. Old school ambiance. 
They brought olives and bread to start. We had scallops and chorizo for appetizer. For entres we had cod fish and they were also accommodating to kids taste. Fantastic."}
{"text":"Solmar is only open for dinner during the summer, and although the website said it would be open at 5pm, at 515 the door was still locked. Unperturbed, we went downstairs to their sister restaurant, La Sauvigne and inquired. They said Solmar would not be open until 530, but that we were welcome to sit in La Sauvigne and eat from the Restaurant Solmar menu. We are so glad we did! It was early in the evening--we wanted to eat before hopping back over the border to Vermont--and tapas was the perfect light food. Our very helpful waiter with the charming French accent made excellent recommendations from both on and off the menu including garlic shrimp, scallops with chorizo (not too spicy, but nicely flavored), grilled calamari (very large portion for tapas), watercress and tomato salad in a lovely vinaigrette and a small platter that included duck confit, smoked salmon and prosciutto. That, along with the *outstanding* bread they serve and a split of a nice Spanish prosecco nicely filled 3 adults and 3 children (ages 7-12) with just enough room to spare for two orders of their decadent profiteroles--ice cream-filled pastries coated in delicious chocolate. Great, knowledgeable service, reasonable prices given the area and quality of food, and a lovely atmosphere. We look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"We didn't eat here but I would give 0 stars because this place was just rude. First they tried to get us in and then once they found out that there was 4 of us the guy in front made a noise and then told us that they didn't have any tables. There were lots of empty tables so we said how about the front and they said they don't serve food in the front just drinks. Later, we passed by some people eating in the front."}
{"text":"One star because the waiter was so nice and attentive. We were the only people in the restaurant which should have given us a clue but it was early and thought others would come in. We ordered  from the price fix menu at the suggestion of the waiter. The first course was a potato soup with no flavor. The shrimp bisque was just ok but both soups were warm not hot. The next course was grilled sqid without any seasoning and my husband had shredded cod with potato which might have been ok if it were served hot but the potato had a musty flavor. It was just not a good meal."}
{"text":"Bon restaurant. On y est allé un jeudi soir , la terrasse était pleine et l'intérieur vide. J'ai choisi la table d'hôte avec le saumon, soupe crème de légumes un peu trop salée. Le saumon était bon avec un sauce crémeuse sans goût. Légume rapini et purée patates navets. J'imaginais un resto portugais avec un plus grand choix de poisson."}
{"text":"We discovered Solmar on our last trip to Montreal 3 years ago, so wanted to find it again.  Located downtown on the second floor, the decor is old world, but warm and romantic.

The waiters are friendly, but service could be a little slow.  They start you off with a bread basket and some olives.  We started with the grilled chorizo which was very good.

Since I ate the pork and clams there 3 years ago, I have been touting it as the best I've had, so I had to make sure that statement was still true and am so happy that I can still say it!

We ordered the pork and clams for 2 and it did not disappoint.  This really is the best I've had. The sauce is so rich and deep and flavorful, you can't help but mop it up with some bread.  The dish is loaded with tender pork and lots of small clams and potatoes.  The potatoes are so creamy and tender and not at all mushy.  It is a fabulous dish.

We also decided to share the almond cake for dessert, which was delicious!  Another great experience at Solmar and hopefully this time I won't have to wait 3 years to go back."}
{"text":"Magical, magnificent, monumental - these words are just the tip of the iceberg of culinary experience to be found in this place. 

I've enjoyed every bite, and really wished I had the room to try more. 

The ambience is wonderful, with live music (not sure if it's a nightly feature). 

Will definitely repeat, when the opportunity arises."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on my last night in Montreal. It was in October and most places were not crowded as it was not a high season.  Plus it was a weeknight.

The place is nightly decorated, dimmed lighting. Waitstaff were friendly. Being a slow night, I think only 2 were on that night.

I had the Portuguese green soup and the Green Mediterranean Porgy (which was deboned table side).  It came with a side of rice and creamed spinach. 
The fish was really good. My friend had the Trout/Salmon on a bed of spinach (I think it was a special) and she loved it. The spinach were very well made in addition. 

We did not get dessert but we had the house wine and that was good."}
{"text":"Came across this place while walking around in the area while visiting Montreal for Jazz Festival. Lobster bisque and Gaspacho were tasty. Entrée- Cod Fish and Mussels (from appetizer menu) were delicious."}
{"text":"I love Portuguese wines and this restaurant has an extensive choice.  The food was excellent, the service impeccable.  I felt it was a little pricey but what restaurant in Montreal isn't?"}
{"text":"Walked around Old Montréal with my parents and cousin while on vacation trying to find a good restaurant for dinner. To be honest, Solmar probably would not have been my first choice and I was not really looking to eat Portuguese food while in Canada. But I was taking my parents out for their anniversary so it was their pick. The restaurant is on the 2nd floor of La Sauvigne. As we entered the dining room, my skepticism was growing since there were only two other groups dining there (especially when every other restaurant in the area had long lines waiting for tables).

My dad wanted red sangria so we ordered that. We also each ordered their 3-course meal, which they offered at the time. I started off with the caldo verde - kale soup, followed with the bacalhau a \"braz\"-  shredded codfish with onions & potatoes, then, the polvo à lagueiro - grilled octopus.

I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. It almost felt like I was back in Lisbon eating authentic Portuguese food. The service was also very friendly despite the kitchen being a little slow at times. We were also treated to a live singing of Fado music. If you don't want to endure the long wait at the other restaurants in the area, then Solmar might be a good place for you."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, and we likes no being rushed and loved the atmosphere on the street.  We had a seafood platter, mussels, and veal.  I get that prices are high in Montreal, but we felt the prices were very small for the prices charged."}
{"text":"Authentic Portuguese restaurant in the heart of Vieux Montreal. The prices are competitive and the selection is good. Had the pork and clams (amêijoas na cataplana) and it was outstanding. They also served peasant bread, Portuguese olives and Portuguese olive oil for dipping."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of Portuguese friends. It made the experience a lot better because of their enthusiasm for all the food. The staff here was great. The owner came out and even said Hi at one point. If you have an appreciation for Portuguese food, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Excellent Portuguese food with very good seafood. Even though in the old port ,rest assured this is NOT a tourist trap .Relaxing old school surrounding and courteous wait staff. However do not come for fado , there is no fado singing here but you will still enjoy the food and the relaxed upscale but not stuffy vibe."}
{"text":"Amazing food, lovely atmosphere.

When we walked in we were a bit nervous because there was hardly anyone there. Why wasn't there a 45 minute wait like every other place on the block? I'm not sure, but everyone waiting at The Keg (etc) is missing out.

The dining room is very lovely and offers a nice view of the cobblestone Old Montreal. Not long into our Saturday evening meal, a band began to play nice music that lasted the entire time.

The food was tremendous!!!!! My parents ordered the Kale Soup, grilled porgy and grilled octopus and really liked all of it. But we all agreed that my seafood rice dish was the most outstanding. It came with mussels, shrimp, scallops, lobster and clams in one of the best broths I've ever tasted. It's as much of a stew or soup as it is a rice dish. If you like seafood, order this! It also comes in a two person portion. 

For Montreal, prices are not bad and the wine list has some nice options. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The food was good, service was extremely slow.  We were there on a busy Saturday night so that may be to blame."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Montreal for a weekend, and considered Solmar, b/c it was Portuguese and we figured it'd be something different. There's an outside seating area, but we found out it was for the other restaurant attached to this one.  You go up some stairs and through a door and this one's kind of hidden. It was mostly empty. My husband ordered a Portuguese beer and for appetizers, we got the Duck with Figs, both of which were pretty good. And it ended there.  We put all of our orders in together in the beginning. My husband got the Rack of Lamb, and asked for medium rare. I got the grilled Cod fish.  We waited over an hour for our food. Over an hour! When our food arrived, we were beyond starving, and the food was horrible. The Lamb was more rare. The Cod still had the horrible taste of fish and was so salty, i could barely eat it. We've had Lamb and Cod before, and this was the worst one we've ever tried. I think they might've ran out of Cod, bought some on the spot, and didn't have enough time to clean it well. The staff was friendly enough and kept apologizing. I would've preferred if they told me they didn't have what I ordered and gave me an option to order something else. I wouldn't go back here or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Hats off! Thanks to Yelp we found this jewel tucked away out of sight on the second floor of EAST rue Paul. There is a West & East side of the street, so don't give up. The food was the best we had in Montreal. Fresh, perfectly balanced, only the best ingredients. Props to the chef, because the passion shows. 
The ambiance is upscale & verged on Morrancan atmosphere. Slower paced, even though the dinning room was virtually empty on a Sunday night. You could have thought you were in Lisbon, if the gracious waiter wasnt fluent in English. Great evening!"}
