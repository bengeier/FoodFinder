{"text":"I ordered the variety platter and the food was good, especially the sheikh kabob. This box is good enough size for an adult and a child. The lady at the counter was helpful enough too, but the serving time was longer than I expected. Even customers who came after me for take out left before me. So I asked politely without any accusations that 'what did I ordered special that is taking time!!'. That time the lady seemed got very pissed off and even though she tried to answer calmly I sensed her anger. Even a lady from the kitchen gave me a look!! 
While I was waiting for past 15 mins I saw the counter lady running around like a chicken, doing all the jobs at the front by herself. Could be that's the reason she is burnt out. I expected a simple apology for 15 mins wait with my daughter, which I didn't get. Rather a very cold thanks!! My suggestion hire more people if you need but don't show it to your customer!!"}
{"text":"the sign say's it all... get the Kebobs, you definitely won't be dissappointed!!! They also have a really good Green chutney, but watch out, that stuff is really really spicey...

Other things i've tried which are good: lamb karahi, tandoori chicken"}
{"text":"I usually do take out from this place even though they ample seating to eat-in.  Food is very decent and price is decent as well.  Tried many of their menu items and so far everything was great and I like the fact that it is very closed to the airport and the hotel I stay in.  I usually call them from the hotel and start driving and they have the food ready by the time I arrive so I don't have to wait and head straight back to the hotel and enjoy it while it is still warm.  This a must stop for me whenever I am in town."}
{"text":"Amazing food for reasonable prices. We got: 
Chicken tikka (white) 
Haleem 
Bihari beef 
Tandoori chicken breast 

Along with this came copious amounts of naan. Seriously, it was like 12-14 pieces!! So fresh and delicious. 

Everything tasted scrumptious! 

Just don't come here when you're in a hurry, our food took 30 minutes because they make everything fresh. It's all good though and totally worth it"}
{"text":"Had to make a trip up to brampton with a friend. used yelp and found this place nearby. Was quite content with everything. had the beef kabob with naan and a mango smoothie. Food was good and quick. The place needs a renovation, but that aside, would go back again for lunch."}
{"text":"Really good Pakistani food that's close to my workplace. Great lunch specials (I got the biryani) and the kebabs and naan are great too."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, well managed, and organized.  We loved dining.  We were a party of about 22 ppl, in which we had 11 adults and 11 kids.  They sat us right away, even though we didn't call for a reservation.  I didn't place my whole order at ones, because I wanted to see what's good, and what everyone liked.  They kept up with every little demand we made.  Cooked dishes coming on the table 5 mins of ordering, and clean was done as soon as there was empty dish on the table.  Dishes were not spicy but they were flavorful.  nothing was over cooked, or burnt.  Quantity wasn't bad either.  We ate, bihar, the family platter of chicken, haleem, karhai.  also there was kabob I believe.  all in all great experience.  it cost us about $220 including tip soda for adults only, and chai at the end.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food and great price! Went there 2 weeks ago and ordered their chicken and rice special with mango Lassi. The dish was 2 pieces of chicken thigh served on rice and a side of salad. They gave us a bottle of chutney (I think it was chutney) dressing on the side. Chicken seemed small on the rice, but it's big flavour made for its portion. It was well seasoned, tender and not dry. The rice was lightly flavoured, delicious as well and so was the dressing. 

Lassi was good but wasn't as cold as I would have preferred.

Overall the portions are well worth it.  $10 for the whole meal. Great place to go if you're looking for great food and not looking to spend a lot. Also they're still a neighborhood hidden gem so haven't gotten too busy yet. Can always find a seat.

Place is not the most modern looking but definitely very clean and tidy. 

Will definitely go back to try more of their menu."}
