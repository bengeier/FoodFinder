{"text":"Rotisserie chicken is serious business here.

This is a chain with only 4 locations but we'll spread out.

They are busy, very busy all the time but their chicken is so much better than St-Hubert.

The sauce and fries are not as good as that other rotisserie chain but the chicken is so tender and juicy it more than makes up for it.

Their ribs are also succulent and lip smacking good. 

Prices are a bit higher for delivery and some great deals are pick-up only but it's worth the trek. 
There's no indoor seating and only a couple of outdoor benches in the summer but take it to go and eat it the nearby Beaubien Park"}
{"text":"With a name so unoriginal (how many rotisseries have au Coq in their name?), one shouldn't be surprised by their food offerings both in content but quality.

It's a rotisserie. You can various forms of chicken, and fries. Nothing special here.

I tried the poutine, and it's also what you'd expect: crinkle cut fries, fresh cheddar curds, and an orangish looking commercial sauce that was actually sweeter than most. A decent poutine, but not one you'd crave."}
{"text":"I've never seen their page when ever I looked to order because it wouldn't pop up in the search, it was under catering.

I've eaten here a few times and it's good. Their sides are great as well, the gravy and
Coleslaw is really good. It's rare a place has every thing that's good usually something will be lacking."}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood about a year now and tried Au Coq a couple times, but the first 2 times I was actually pretty dissappointed.  I ordered off the delivery menu the first time and then a 2 person box special the 2nd and both times I kind of felt ripped off.  But this past Wednesday we were coming back from the river and decided to give it one more shot for the Wednesday $6.25 chef's choice box (comes with chef's choice of thigh or breast, coleslaw, fries, and sauce) because it seemed like a good deal, and we were actually blown away by how delicious it was.

I'm not sure why I had such a negative experience the first couple times, but for under 15$ including tax,  my boyfriend and I literalliy feasted on some of the most melt off the bone succulent chicken I have ever had, grilled and seasoned to perfection, a really amazing coleslaw just the right amount of vinegar/mayo ratio, and a realliy decent, flavourful sauce that gives Swiss Chalet a run for it's money.  The Wednesday special is honestly an amaaaazing food deal to be found in Verdun. 

The only downside is the obviously pre frozen krinkle cut fries, they dont' add much to the experience, but when you drench them in the hefty serving you get of gravy/sauce that comes with the combo, all is forgiven.

I eagerly await wednesdays now as I think this will become one of our new dinnertime traditions!"}
{"text":"I went to the Au Coq location in the Rosemount area for rotisserie chicken takeout. Au Coq is a well known area restaurant due to their little red delivery cars.

I went there on Friday night and the restaurant was very busy. There were a lineup of people who were there for takeout. I ordered the chicken leg meal with some fries. It cost less than 10 dollars.

The chicken was okay similar to the BBQ chicken you get at Swiss Chalet restaurants in Ontario. The fries were mediocre and not very good.

Would I go back? Maybe, but the rotisserie chicken was just okay."}
{"text":"Boo hoo, the chicken box special on Wednesday(s), is now up to $6.25 + taxes. I wonder if it has anything to do with Justin Bieber's recent press. I'm sure the crowds will be back."}
