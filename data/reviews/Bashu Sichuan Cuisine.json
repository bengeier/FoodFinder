{"text":"Definitely worth the trip from downtown if you're a Sichuan fan. Unlike another reviewer I have found better in Vancouver from time to time (at places now closed, sadly), but this is still pretty damn good. Any fish cooked in oil dish, e.g. waterboiled fish, whole fish in oil = very good. Dishes were less spicy than I expected, but good enough. Great watermelon juice, and 2-for-1!"}
{"text":"Ok. I find it my obligation to help give this restaurant the recognition it deserves.

By far, one of my favorite restaurants to grab some \"authentic\" sichuan food!

What are these people ordering from here that its getting such a bad review?
Maybe these people come in here with hopes of finding Cantonese style cooking? C'mon now, go across the street for that. 

Everytime I come into this place I will robotically order the same thing and it never disappoints.  1.) Spicy sichuan beef (fu chi fei pian) 2.) Water boiled fish (Shui zhu yu) 3.) & any none spicy dish to counter balance all the spice of 1&2.

Be prepared to get sent to another world with these dishes. No joke, my gf and I will sit quietly for 10 mins at a time just scarfing down these dishes lips as red as Ronald Mcdonald & sweating like freaks.. LOL.. but its so good! 

I admit there was one time out of the many where I found the dishes were not as good as previously experienced. I gave the chef the benefit of the doubt that day. Maybe he had his apron on too tight or something :X

All in All this place is seriously the best place in Toronto for those dishes I mentioned, if not North America. Tried finding something to come close in Vegas, Miami and Vancouver with no luck!

I always dream of this place when I'm craving for spicy sichuan food!

4.6 stars from me

P.s. Be prepared to sweat. Try not to wear so many layers of clothing.

P.s.s. Try to avoid the Lunch or Dinner rush if you hate waiting. The lines can get crazy sometimes."}
{"text":"This is the best Sichuan restaurant in the Greater Toronto Area. The menu is extensive and the food is fantastic. It`s not your usual Sichuan food quickly prepared in a wok. The chef is from Beijing from a well known restaurant. I have not had flavours like this since I visited China. The prices are very reasonable and the service is good.
I live downtown but its worth the drive.I was at the Scarborough location (recently renovated)
not far from Pacific Mall at 4771 Steeles  Ave. E"}
{"text":"Pretty good szechuan food!  Spicy spicy spicy, but in a good way.  There are also dishes that are not spicy, a huge menu and, like many chinese restaurants or any chinese establishments, pretty much anywhere in the world, from Toronto to L.A., Hong Kong to Shanghai, they take cash only.  If you're chinese, you'll know this is a fact of life, so get used to it!!

My family did the ordering so I'm not sure what everything was but the dan dan mein was very spicy and every table ordered at least one, sometimes two because they are not very big.  The spicy pot of frog legs was surprisingly very good!  And the pork sung wrapped in green onion pancake was crispy and not overly doughy.  If you need to cool your mouth down, I would suggest the cold dow tsung (soy milk).

This is a pretty good restaurant and during the lunch hour, there was only one waitress with about 10-12 tables going and while there was a little wait, she did pretty well!"}
{"text":"The food is 5 star. The heat is perfect...almost sweating :) The food arrives just as it appears in the pictures on the menu - two menu's one with chef specials/favorites with pictures of each and the other contains all other menu items.
Decor is nice especially the chairs!
Wait staff pleasant. 
Beer could be colder light fixtures need cleaning - don't get me wrong the place is clean but a little more attention would make it spotless.
If you want real Szechuan this is the place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has rebranded itself to Tian Fu Chinese Restaurant.  Food remains tasty ans spicy."}
{"text":"I've been here since 8 years ago when I was still in high school and it had always been the best Sichuan cuisine in town in my opinion. 

Tastes changed though recently because I heard the owner changed... This is really a pitty. Especially for loyal customers like me from years ago."}
{"text":"The food was delicious - just the right amount of heat (we ordered only 1&2 chili dishes). The hot braised fish tasted fresh,  and the chilled pork appetizer was delicious. The other food was good as well. The stone crab hot pot looked popular but we didn't get a chance to try it. Prices are quite reasonable. 

In terms of decor, it looks like the usual uninspired Chinese design, and the level of service about what you would expect from Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Service too slow.....the deep fried chicken taste strange."}
{"text":"Meh. 

My family, a couple friends and I dined here recently hoping for since authentic Sichuan food. The food is alright, not particularly spicy. Appeared to be \"white-washed\", and this could have been attributed to the fact that we had two white people with us, but I suspect this was not the case. 

I was recently in the Sichuan region, and so perhaps I'm being a bit particular. 

The food presentation was nice. Nothing fancy. We ordered about 15-20 dishes. And I cannot remember anything memorable about it. 

The one thing I do remember is the Ma Po Dou Fu. This was particularly disappointing for me. When the dish was served, there was a small pile of Sichuan peppers ground up in the middle of dish. It was not mixed in. (What is the point of that? It doesn't look pretty!) This was my biggest upset, especially since I came to this restaurant hoping for authentic Sichuan Ma Po Dou Fu. 

The service was inattentive.

We spilled our tea out of tea cups accidentally twice. We had to ask for a cloth to clean up the mess despite the servers staring right at us. And when the server cleaned the spilled tea with his rag, he touched the chopsticks with the dirty rag. We had to ask to replace the chopsticks. And I'm fairly certain that he placed the dirty contaminated chopsticks back into the clean chopsticks pile.

Cause for concern.

Summer weekday night dinner. Not very busy. One or two small tables of two patrons each and a family of five just leaving when we entered. Hardly the bustling place that I imagined it would be. 

I am really confused at the other 5-star reviews that this place has, and how it had became recommended by Chowhounders for Sichuan food. 

The long and short of it:

The restaurant is not bad (for a Chinese restaurant). Just not my cup of tea.

However, this is not the place for authentic Sichuan despite what Chowhounders on the internet say. It may have been true once, but it is no longer true. 

Go if you must, but there are (must be) better things out there."}

If you want really spicy, numb your lips spicy.. that's the place you should come!

Trust me, if I say it is spicy, it is spicy.. no hot sauce required on the side.

I dropped by for lunch.. Though there are no lunch specials the prices here are really cheap..

The cold noodle ($3.99)  is mixed with seasame, green onion and hot oil. The noodles are the narrow and chewy. Make sure you mix the noodles well with the sauce before you start eating! Yes it is spicy and it is good!

The Chive and pork dumplings ($3.99) on the other hand tasted like frozen ones! The skin are really thick and the inside has not much soup. I will say it is ok...not great... I will not order it again.

I was so full after eating these!! Stuffed full till dinner time!

The services is fast and efficient. Though no smile and thanks for the waitress..but I got what I need.

Cash only!

No Lunch Specials!"}
