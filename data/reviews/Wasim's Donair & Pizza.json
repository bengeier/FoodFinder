{"text":"Pizza was awesome. Donair wad nothing special. Would reorder the pizza not the donair"}
{"text":"Wasim is friendly and makes the best pizza in the city. We drive all the way from the Southeast to purchase some. 5 stars! Keep up the good work Wasim!"}
{"text":"A friend strongly recommended Wasim's this past weekend, so we stopped in for Donairs on Friday night. They were very very good. Large portions, awesome deal and delicious.  Saturday night we decided to try the Lasagne. I have to say, it isn't that great. It tastes like a can of diced tomatoes tossed on some noodles with a minor amount of ground beef. There is no seasoning and very little meat to be calling it a meat sauce. For a place that should have no shortage of garlic on site, there wasn't even garlic in the meatless sauce. Portion size was good for the price but in the end, treat yourself to a box of KD with a can of diced tomatoes on it and you'll have a better meal.  Will try the Pizza.... stay tuned.."}
{"text":"My experience with Wasim's started off enjoyable. Ordered 10 hot buffalo wings and small Hawaiian for pickup. Pizza tasted fine, standard quality of ingredients you will find at a cheap pizza place. Crust was above average, thin and crispy. The buffalo wings had a different sauce, somewhat enjoyable but I prefer the tried and true butter and franks. When I started eating the wings I noticed about 4/10 with broken joints, telltale sign of using the bottom of the barrel chicken.   The pizza is what really let me down, and the reason I will not be returning. On the 3rd slice I found a bone in the pizza. Continued on now a little disgusted, but still hungry. But to my delight I was greeted with another bone in the pizza on the 5th slice! Now how do bone's cross contaminate into cheese, ham, pineapple, or pizza sauce? It doesn't unless the preparation of either ingredients or pizza was done in a contaminated environment. It tells me these people are not clean in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Had the donair here a few times. It's not bad. The amount of greens in it are a bit too much but still over all its average."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place after work and was pleasantly surprised. My buddy had the xl donair; it was friggen long! Tasted the meat and it was good. The pizza though, is really really good. The crust is not too thick not too thin and not greasy at all. 12\" pick-up was $11 and comes with 4 toppings. It's got a nice size menu of items. If in the NE, give it a try, it's quite tasty!"}
{"text":"Great pizza as always! the donairs are great too.  Customer service is outta this world, such nice people.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Love their Donairs its the \"bomb diggity\" as the kids call it But really I love the Donairs"}
{"text":"We order from wasims all the time. We always order Donairs and cheesy bread. The Donairs have the standard greatness that you find on a delicious pita and have lots of toppings to choose from. The prices are really good and are not shy with the meat. The pizza dough is always fresh in my experience. We have ordered the donair pizza and sometimes it lacks enough sweet sauce and our house all love extra sweet sauce!  I love that we can order a couple Donairs and will deliver to my address in marlbrough. When we do go to the actual store the lady at the counter is super nice. The store is clean and that is good"}
{"text":"Love their pizza and good prices. But I miss the pick up special for 2 large 2 topping pizza @ $22. Unbeatable. Still good pizza."}
