{"text":"Larry's just opened up down the block from my house and his food is DELICIOUS. Fish fried and seasoned to pure perfection. My fiance and I plan on being regulars. He almost makes me want to try out chitterlings for the first time! Apart from the delicious food, Larry is a pleasure to talk to since he makes you feel like family. I'm hoping that Larry's is here to stay!"}
