{"text":"Lemon pepperrrrrr!!!! Best wings in Vegas here! I eat WINGS once a week to stay healthy"}
{"text":"I came with my girl friend and tried some wings and fingers , everything was fantastic 

I was skeptical about coming but as I thought this place was great , service was fast pace and professional and food was made fresh. 
I am I big wing guy and often visit many spots around the Valley 
Hamburger hut 
Chicken shack 
Wingstop 
Wings and things 
That's just some of my favorites 

Overall I'll recommend this spot to friends and family !"}
{"text":"I feel like I missed something because I didn't think this was a five star like other reviewers. 

The garlic parmesan were a grease sponge and the bbq ones weren't very flavorful. We also had to order a medium side of blue cheese for $1.79. At other places, this is typically included with the wings and not charged separately. 

I hate to say this but I've gotten better wings at chain pizza places. Even though the service was friendly, I think the search for great wings will continue."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat at, especially since I love chicken wings. Only thing I don't like is that the pice is a little to pricey, but the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Well this place won't last long at this rate all of the bad reviews are true, I too got the wrong orders, greasy small wings,  and to top
It off wings with a funky smell almost like rotten smell which prompted me to throw away the complete order. I feel bad but I guess if u wants wings have them from anywhere but this place.   If you go well be warned."}
{"text":"Was told by the old asian lady (who by was a very nice lady) at the counter that these will be the best wings I have ever had. Needless to say I was underwhelmed. I don't know if my expectations were high or if they were just that mediocre. It was worth a try, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We got an order of Hot Garlic and an order of Hot & Sweet.  The wings were very skinny, fatty, greasy, and to make it worse, they didn't put enough sauce so I ended up adding some Kraft BBQ sauce I had at home.  

The fries were pretty mushy, greasy, and tasteless.  

And to finish it off, both of us got food poisoning!!   I noticed that when they were serving them, a couple of wings fell on the kitchen counter and they just put it right in my box.  When I saw that I was crossing my fingers that the kitchen counter would have been as clean as their mixing bowls, but maybe that was not the case.  

DEFINETLY NOT COMING BACK."}
{"text":"Wanted chicken wings today, got here and doors are locked. Tried calling no answer. I'm sure they are out of business :("}
{"text":"Wings are good here.  And good wings are hard to find.  They are meaty, flavorful and spun well.  So, if the wings are good and your looking for good wings, you should visit this restaurant.  

However, if you would like to dine in a nice, clean restaurant, maybe this isn't the best spot for you.  Wings puts about as much effort into their upkeep as creativity they put forth while coming up with a name for their restaurant.  I think they could do better.  

But, I'm still an occasional customer.  Like I stated, good wings are hard to come by.  The owner is nice and frequently on site.  If she were to put a little more effort into ambiance, I think her sales would pop."}
{"text":"Hands down the best customer service I've had ordering carry out! And the wings are great! If in Henderson, go here over any other wings spot."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for wings, especially during football season. Service is always friendly, and fast considering all wings are made to order. I have seen a few negative reviews, and none of their experiences mirror any of mine. If given the chance drop by pick up a pound or two of wings and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Very nice service and wonderful wings! Too many snobs this side of town down rating this place."}
{"text":"The lemon pepper wings and the hot garlic wings we're absolutely delicious and we will be returning!"}
{"text":"Great wings, friendly owner, alittle pricey compared to wingstop I think. But I will always return as I lovvvee chicken wings."}
{"text":"This place has the worst wings I ever tasted. The wings were cooked in grease that seemed like it was weeks old. Disgusting!! There was only one person working at the cash register and touching the money and then the food. The place looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years, spider webs and dust caked on the air vents and walls. It was one of the few meals in a long time that I tossed in the trash. Waste of money!!!!"}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars hands down - the guy who was working at the restaurant is probably one of the most hard working guys I've ever encountered. He was attentive even though it got pretty busy in the restaurant. 

I like how everything is made to order and price is decent. We ordered Cajun Kickers which is supposedly 4x spicy but honestly I didn't even taste the \"heat\" and same goes for the Hot Garlic. Maybe next time we'll try something else."}
{"text":"The menu board is hard to read. The wings are sold by the pound. They don't include carrots and celery or ranch or blue cheese. Those are extra $$.  They are big pieces but I didn't enjoy the flavor. My husband didn't like them either. I was hungry so I ate several but woke up in the middle of the night and got sick."}
{"text":"Best wing place, bar none! Delicious, very fresh, very clean. Much better than BuffaloWildWings. Im always happy i went here. The owner is sweet, local and adorable. Try the bbq, spicy teriyaki or garlic parm, those are my favorites. After ur first bite, you'll forget any other wing place, guaranteed!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've eaten here a few times and even had them carter lunch for the company I work for. The wings are fried to perfection! The fries are delicious and their hot sauces are amazing too!
Once you eat here you'll never want wings from any other place again because they just won't compare!"}
{"text":"Best wings I've come across! Lemon pepper wings never fail to satisfy my taste buds  and the fries have a special taste I can't get over!"}
{"text":"Our experience was not good. The wings are large in size, but they are drenched in (hot) sauce that's not so great and the garlic parmesan, talk about greasy... it pooled at the bottom of the wax paper. We tried a dry rub and it was no better."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst experience I had at a business. 
I ordered on the phone an hour earlier for wings and had to wait another hour to get my order. She said you have to wait because you did not pay yet. What? But you can't pay over the phone. I never heard such a thing. The place was so understaffed for a busy day. They had only two people preparing food. When I went to round table earlier, they had 5 people preparing food, just as a comparison.  The wings were also tiny and bland. Definitely will not come back! Wingstop still the best, even my guests said it was okay, they said it to be nice."}
{"text":"Don't bother and fly away...that's my recommendation!!!! 

My girlfriend and I Picked up a sandwich from next door (JImmy John..not bad) thought we would complement it with an order of wing. She went and got the sandwich while I ordered the wings.

Walked in to two people sitting there waiting for there order, or should I say pacing! Warning one!!

You order by the pound, not by the quantity. How many chicken wings in a pound? We'll come to find out, couldn't get a precise answer...somewhere between 6-10 I was told. 
Warning two!!

Girlfriend comes back with sandwich 10 minutes later..long line she says, sorry it took awhile! People in front of me still pacing. 
Warning three!!

10 min later peeps in front finally get their order, still waiting for mine. Meantime notice  wings go in, no scale, wings come out, no scale? Didn't I buy by the pound??? Warning four!!!

Finally get my order! For the record..I got 7...for $7..hmm you do the math!! I ask for blue cheese, not ranch please. Oh no I'm told, you only get wings..sauce is extra..Really??

Flew the coop...never to return!!!"}
{"text":"Yuki is a person, who quite like her wings, would not be done justice by mere words. Its like trying to describe the fragrence of a flower. Mere words on a review can\"t properly convey transcendence, or enlightenment, its something that one must undertand, not simply believe. Experience for yourself the Wings."}
{"text":"Favorite wings in town! Not to mention the service is absolutely amazing!!!!!! Been coming to eat here for 3 years now"}
{"text":"I love this place. We come all the way from mountains edge to eat here. They have started including small wings w the regular wings. But if you want big wings only just ask. This place is the best for wings and fries.  The owner is so nice and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"I ordered 4 chicken tender combo. I got 4 little crunchy chicken nuggets. I ordered a side of ranch and the little container was only filled half way with ranch. The fries were also crunchy and burnt. I will not go here again"}
{"text":"1st timer here and definitely worthy of coming back! First of all, suki the chef (and manager?) was SO SWEET! She was very funny and hospitable. Secondly, the wings were delicious! I ordered the #2 (2 pounds of wings) and got their top 2 selling flavors of garlic parm and lemon pepper. The garlic parm isn't saucy like the ones at bdubs so it was a nice change. And the lemon pepper wings aren't as salty as wing stop wings. Overall the wings were prepared fresh, came out hot and crunchy! Their fries were big and thick cut and sprinkled with salt and sugar like Wing stop. Also they make the buttermilk ranch in house! This place was very good and I def recommend this spot to everyone!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  These wings are legit friendly staff n good food make it easy to come back"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but it didn't happen. It started out great! The owned greeted me and was extremely friendly. She talked to me and gave me suggestions as I spent around 5 minutes looking at the menu deciding what I wanted. I settled on 1/2 sweet and spicy, 1/2 lemon pepper, side of fries, and a side of veggies. As everything was made I order, it took around 15 minutes for everything to be cooked and prepared. Thankfully I was the only one in the place. As she bagged my items, she insisted I try a French fry.... They were hot, crispy, and seasoned extremely tasty, I really enjoyed them. Enjoyed them so much I ate most of them on my way home. Once I got home I dug into the wings. 1st was the sweet and spicy, the wings were very plump which I'm not a fan of, I like them real crispy. The flavor had a weird aftertaste that I couldn't figure out till I tasted the lemon pepper. It was butter. The sauce was made with butter, lots of butter. Not for me. The lemon pepper should have been called lemon salty pepper cause it was so salty you tasted really no lemon flavor. I ordered I think 18 wings and ate about 5 wings then tossed them. I usually NEVER get flavored wings but traditional buffalo and maybe that's where I went wrong. I will definitely give this place another try especially cause of how friendly the owner lady was but I will be sticking to buffalo sauce only and requesting extra crispy. There is hope for this place with a few minor changes. I hope they figure it out. Lots of potential."}
{"text":"It was not great. But it wasn't raw. So they get two stars. :/ not a fan of the sauce. Or the ranch. The fries were soggy and sweet ? Not a fan. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Best Wings Ever. Never disappointed, Lemon Pepper is our favorite!"}
{"text":"Seriously, I love this place. Cute little restaurant next to Spicy Pickle, I have always wanted to go in but I kept forgetting. My boyfriend and I come in and get the 20 piece large French fries and two drinks combo and its so satisfying! He got the buffalo hot wings (which he loved and if he loves it then you know its good) and I got the Polynesian (I'm not much of a spicy person) and they were both flavorful and delicious. The lady there was so nice too! She was working alone and people kept coming in and she still did her best to help us with everything we needed. I suggest everyone should come and try them! When I get a craving for some wings, I come here. It is so good!"}
{"text":"Aptly named, Wings Restaurant features...wings.  And not just any wings, these are some of the best I've had, period.  I got the BBQ and teriyaki sauces on the 10-piece order and it was delicious; the outside was crispy and the sauce was not too overpowering, although the wings themselves are a little on the small side.  (The fries are nice and greasy, too.)  I still think the Chicken Shack is the best place for big wings, although they are the coated variety, so I guess it doesn't quite count.  This place is pretty decent for the traditional kind, though.  I will definitely come back and partake of the BBQ and teriyaki flavors again; they were fantastic."}
{"text":"Love this little locally owned shop. Seriously best wings in town. The owner is always so nice and remembers us. Worth the stop for good fresh quality wings, unlike those big chains with fake chicken and bag sauce."}
{"text":"Owner is so nice. Good wings. Great location. I think the layout of eating area needs more work. Other than that, wings are flavorful and cooked right when you order it. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Lemon Pepper wings are great! Wing Stop finally has competition. I honestly wasn't expecting much, but when I took my first bite I was amazed at how much flavor the wings had without having to dip it in ranch."}
{"text":"Not as good as most wing places I've been too.  I prefer the big chains like WingStop and Buffalo Wild Wings over this place.  It's not that it was bad, but just wasn't really that good either.  I took my son here and we both ordered their chicken strips and fries combo.  My son ordered BBQ and I ordered Cajun and Hot Garlic.  I wasn't really into any of the sauces to be honest.  I didn't think either of them were very hot at all.  The biggest issue was with the chicken strips.  What we received looked absolutely nothing like the combination picture they have right on the wall/menu.  The strips pictured are what you would typically expect, some sort of long strips;  however we received something that more closely resembles chicken nuggets and they were so caked on with breading that there was hardly any actual chicken.  Not sure what sort of crusty concoction the use for the crust of these strips, but it was way too thick so I felt like I was eating about 75% breading and hardly any chicken.  Even my 9 year old commented on this a few times, and chicken is just about all he likes to eat.  We and my son were the only guests the entire time we were eating and I can tell why.  I honestly don't see myself coming back.  I would recommend Johnny Macs, Wingstop, BWW, or Chicken Shack over this place.  I also didn't get any dipping sauce for the fries which is crazy, it looked like I would have to pay .49 for ranch which I understand if I am buying extra ranch, but for one that is lame."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like going in to a busy hooters one night and decided to give this place a go. When we walked in the lady at the counter(she was the owner) gave us recommendations(basically told us what we had to get lol) she was very social fancied my husband and last name which kept our meal entertaining and fun. She talked to the kids and checked on us multiple times. We ordered mild wings for the kids and would definitely get the medium or hot next time they didn't have much taste. The price and quality of the wings were awesome not fatty, nice and crispy and not too small I was impressed with it being such a small place. The lemon pepper was very tasty and the spicy bbq was good. We will return for sure."}
{"text":"This is an a-ok wing restaurant. They offer wings and tenders, and then beans, potato salad, and fries as sides. There are a variety of meal deals, as well as wings by the pound. Takes about 15 minutes for an order to be ready. 

When we stopped in to get takeout, there was exactly one staffer working. She was very pleasant and friendly.

The restaurant itself has a rundown, dive feel to it, and it's rather tiny. This is really a spot meant for takeout, not dining in.

We ordered 2 pounds of wings (which come with 1-2 flavor choices) and seasoned fries, with ranch and blue cheese dipping sauces. There are several flavors of varying heat levels to choose from - everything from super hot to Hawaiian to lemon pepper. We went with cajun and buffalo hot (they're 2nd and 3rd spiciest according to the menu).

The wings were alright. Good size. Ok quality. Neither flavor was spicy at all - both were very mild. I perhaps would've liked the wings better if I'd ordered them wet. The ranch and blue cheese dipping sauces were decent - better than what you get at most places.

The fries were...fries. Cooked well, seasoned well. Tasty enough.

Overall, the jury is still somewhat out on this place. It was better than I was expecting. I'm hoping a spicier flavor and ordering them wet will give me the wings I'm searching for."}
{"text":"Love the wings here!! The owner Suki is so nice, remembers my gf's name when we come in. The lemon pepper wings are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Sad came here at 9:30 and they said they were closed. Totally will never be back! Sad as the food was good, but in Vegas you got one time to screw up in customer service. I never got an apology!"}
{"text":"The wings were just okay, nothing to go out your way to get. Whatever you do, don't order fries. You can't describe them as burnt. Just very dark brown and soggy, the worst. I asked the server why they looked like that and she stated that the grease  was old and needed to be changed. I'm sure this was a slip on her part. So if you're in need of food I recommed Jimmy Johns next door."}
{"text":"One of the best lowkey wing spots in Las Vegas/Henderson. The wings are cooked to absolute perfection and the service is very friendly and personal. The wait is a little long for bigger orders because everything is cooked fresh. Completely worth it. Free refills while you wait too. 

The Lemon Pepper wings are my top recommendation."}
{"text":"I was quite satisfied with their buffalo wings and their friendly service. The wings were large, fresh and cooked just right, unlike the overcooked chicken wings from malnourished chickens at Buffalo Wild Wings. It's a good idea to call-in your take out orders because it takes at least 15 minutes to fry up a batch of wings, but it's definitely worth the wait. The buffalo wings are not as spicy as I have come to expect, so if you like them spicy, give the Hell Fire wings a try. You can order as many pieces as you like, but you will be charged by the pound. In general, you get six wings per pound at a cost of $6.99 per pound. For each pound of chicken wings, you can choose up to two different flavors. Here's a sample order for you drunk fockers out there. \"May I have two pounds of wings? Let's go with one pound of Hell Fires and one pound of the garlic parmesan and, if it's not too much trouble, can you throw in a medium sized container of your homemade ranch dressing?\""}
{"text":"if i could give this place negative stars i would! i went to this nasty establishment yesterday and spent close to 50 dollars! the food was greasy and tasteless the wings had little to no sauce and the fries were so soggy, greasy and tasteless! i always give a company the benefit to fix issues so i called today and spoke the with owner. when i called and asked for the manager she automatically assumed that i was trying to sell something, went off on me before i could say a word and hung up on me! i called back and held for about 5 mins and when she got back on the phone she gave nothing but excuses about why the food was nasty. then asked me to bring the food back and when i told her i had thrown it away she had the nerve to tell me to dig in the trash, find it and bring it back! i wouldn't feed this to my dog and the customer service i just received is beyond unacceptable! i have never been so disrespected by a manager let alone an owner! don't eat here!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Over cooked, dry, not enough sauce. What sauce we got was very generic
 We were the only customers in the place she not got the order wrong. She was almost calling me a liar when she insisted that the ranch dressing was blue cheese and after examining it and realized she was wrong gave me more excuses instead of just getting me horrible watered down what they call blue cheese dressing."}
{"text":"My wife and I were hungry and at my request we settled for WINGS. Instead of going to the awesome sandwich shop next door. (I forget the name) we entered the door of \"WINGS\".
Yes the asian lady is kind and does a history lesson and a hard sell of the fare they provide. I just don't see it!
The other reviews say negative points over the last year or so. Doesn't this lady read these?
HOT HOT temperature of the GREASE Coated wings.
No paper plates for normal meal eating.
My wife thought the coleslaw was safe, but.... NO! 
A TV played a peoples court show just above our heads. I guess it's best to get take out but even then you're still stuck with the grease bag."}
{"text":"Great food! Chicken tenders are done well. Fries are excellent! I highly recommend... Family owned business service is great and the prices are just right !"}
{"text":"Best wings I've had in all of Las Vegas! They are very meaty & not those extra tiny wings some places have. Tons of flavor options. The owner is very nice and place is clean."}
{"text":"Best wings I've ever had in Vegas.
Great service with a good family vibe
I'll definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"3 stars for the food, 5 stars for the service! The wings were large and meaty but I was underwhelmed with the sauces. I tried the garlic parmesean and the original buffalo sauce. Both were decent. The gar/parm is just a healthy sprinkle of cheese when I was expecting an actual sauce. The original tasted like a cross between Louisiana hot sauce and Tabasco. Very runny. I prefer the thicker wing sauces myself. My husband had the BBQ and lemon pepper and he was happy. I'm mainly writing to compliment the young lady who was working yesterday. She was so sweet and informative. She needs a raise for sure. I'll go back because of her and its close proximity to my hair salon but I'm still in search of my dream wings since Bonz closed on 215 Decatur."}
{"text":"Yoooo suki is the shit!!! She makes better food then yo mama!! If you haven't had her wings you haven't started living yet!!! Get yo ass ova to WINGS!!!"}
{"text":"Best wings in town! The Cajun and lemon pepper wings are to die for. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"These are the best wings in town. I get the lemon pepper and fries. Both are amazing and the service is great too!"}
{"text":"Ok Folks!!! This is a buisness owned by Suki (So sorry if I misspelled your name). I have tried my fair share of wings and saw this place.  Corner of eastern and St. Rose Pkwy next to jimmy John's. I love self owned businesses. I walk in and I am greeted by this older asian women. Seriously like you were in Asia and stumbled into a noodle bar or something. She is very sweet and spunky. The menu has a good variety of flavors. I was in the mood for spicy. So I ordered the the number 1 combo with Cajun wings. She cooked them up for me lickety split and I was on my way. She said next time to call her and say \"Suki drop the wings I'm on my way\". We laughed and I walked out. This place has definite character and has been around 15 years. I went to my car and my wife was with me (of course) and we consumed the food. The wings were hot, plump, seasoned, sauced and spicy OH YEAH!! The fries are homemade and she made me try one in front of her....LOL!!! Was waiting for her to say \"you run along and be a good boy. Come back tomorrow and try garlic parm  or  teryaki\". I loved it. Fries are DA BOMB!!! LOVE seasoned homemade fries you dip in ranch. It hit the spot. They aren't number 1 on the planet, but if you want to have some good wings with that cool aunt who always fed you, go see Suki at Wings Restaurant!!! She will hook you up!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is lovely. Exceptional service. Got the hot garlic and original spicy buffalo sauces. Both were music to my taste buds. The wings are jumbo! Lots of meat. Made to order which is super, RESPECT. Looking forward to trying the lemon pepper. Thank you to the owner for the kind words."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be great because of the location. Unfortunately we we're disappointed. The wings are good in size but lacking in flavor. I had the hot and sweet wings but they were not hot or sweet. Just tasted like deep fried wings. We had the cajun wings, not as hot as it says it should be. Lemon pepper wings were plain. No flavor!! Fries are okay. Nothing special about the place. Not impressed and we won't be going back. What really made us decide we will never go back is there is only one person working, an older woman who takes the orders, serves and cooks. When we got there we were the only family there. About 15 minutes later four different groups showed up and when they wanted paper towels or ketchup she took from our table and passed it around. Seriously, they need to get more paper towel rolls and more than one bottle of ketchup. We're still looking for a great hot wings restaurant."}
{"text":"You guys, this is serious so listen up. I decided to write a poem because I'm feeling really emotional about these wings. I've finally found the meaning of life and I found it in a lemon pepper chicken wing. Trust. 

I love these chicken wings I really do
They defiantly don't taste anything like poo
They're crispy and zesty and tangy oh my
I'm fully aware they go straight to my thigh(s)
The inside of this place looks a little bit hood
But don't let that scare you cause they're freakin good 
You'll love them more than your first born kid
So go get some wings, you'll be thankful you did

Seriously, what are you waiting for? Go!"}
{"text":"This place is THE BEST wing place I have ever been too. Sure it isnt plush feeling at all but that adds to the charm. Each order is made fresh and this not some big change.  This place has an asian flare to it and the owner clearly knows her wings inside and out. 

Try the Spicey Teriyaki, Garlic Parm and Western BBQ. If you can handle it try the spicier flavors that have chile ratings next to them. This place is a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the less than stellar ratings. The food is awesome. 

My sister and I were driving through from LA and were starving. We saw the wings sign and, out of desperation, stopped. I was hesitant when I saw it had three stars but was starving, like I said. 

We ordered the buffalo hot and lemon pepper. They were crispy and had the right amount of sauce/seasoning. The fries are great, and you can tell they're fresh cut in house. 

Sure the decor isn't trendy but is that what you care about when you want wings?! I sure as hell don't. I would drive out of my way to come back here again."}
{"text":"Soooo the sign on the door says Best Wings in Town and so far I'd have to agree! They were cooked perfectly, the garlic Parmesan actually had garlic and Parmesan flavor! I got it in the combo with The homemade fries which were amazing and a bottle water. It was affordable and delicious! Plus the woman cooking  and running the place was amazing, sweet, funny and really put out a good welcoming vibe! I love these little family run restaurants versus a big chain restaurant. Much more personal and right around the corner from my house! I will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"We love this place, not only because of the tasty wings, but because of the sweet lady running this place. She makes it such a pleasant experience every time we come in. We always order the buffalo hot (which seem to be the perfect kind of hot) and the garlic parm. So good! And I have to say-TRY THE FRIES! they season them with the most magical salty/sweet seasoning. Super addictive! 

The only downside, and from what I've read in other reviews, is that they charge for the ranch or blue cheese dressing. I know everyone includes it in their cost, but come on, let's not be cheapos. You know you have a bottle in your fridge or can afford another $1.00 for some dressing. 

We'll continue to go here until we move again. Very good!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch. I always order the wings and fries. The fries are delicious and i love their ranch. The owner is always very friendly!"}
{"text":"Big wings .. full of flavor ..better then all the fast food style wing spots .. fries are amazing"}
{"text":"The wings are super goooood. My favorite is the cajun flavor. They also have the best seasoned fries. Im so addicted. However although the owner lady is really nice, they refuse to take orders over the phone, like they will take it but not make it until you get there so that they are fresh. Thats nice and all but the point was to avoid the wait. I have mentioned this before but it hasnt worked. Aside from that, I will continue to come back, the wings are always cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I like this place. The lady that works at this place is very nice and hospitable. Its nothing fancy, more of a take out place. They have a menu of both wings and fingers and then a bunch of specials or meal type deals. The fingers were good, crispy and good size portion. Cole slaw was crisp, not too much mayo which I like. Wings were good too! I have yet to try all the flavors. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I usually order takeout wings from here. The lady who owns the restaurant is very sweet. The space is really small, but I'm sure most people do takeout / carryout anyways. 

My go to flavour is lemon pepper. I've also tried garlic parmesan which was also pretty good.

Wings are ordered by the pound, but you need to order more than one pound to get more than one flavour."}
{"text":"My favorite place for wings is Wing Stop but Wings is my second. I eat here like once every week or two. I always get the 1 pound buffalo wing combo. Their french fries are out of this world. They taste similar to wingstops where they add a lil sugar on top. Yummy my mouth is watering rn haha. The owner Suki is very sweet and hard working. On mothers day she gave out flowers to all the moms and eventhough Im not one to a human I still got a rose for being a dog mom hehe."}
{"text":"We want wings for Superbowl Sunday of course. Called to order at 1pm for pick up at 3pm.  They said it would be for 3:05. Ok 5 Min no big deal. My husband went to pick up at 2:50 and there was a super long line out the door. I called the restaurant and they said just come in but my husband said there's no way to just go in besides most people in line ordered already too. By the time he got in to pay at 3:45, they still didn't have the order ready. I don't know how the wings taste yet but just from the experience with picking up they get 1 star.

ETA husband said they were nice so upgrade to 2 stars..."}
{"text":"I cannot emphasize how much I love this place! I don't know why it has such low score, but its a great place to get wings! The wings and fries are cooked fresh. For those people who are impatient, I promise u that the wait is worth it. It is not a crowded restaurant and the customer service is excellent. When I go there to to eat wings, the person serving is super sweet! She makes you feel welcomed and she wants to build customer relationships. She is one of the main reasons I go there, next to how they have the best wings in town!

I say if you love wings, try it! 
If you love Wingstop, try it!
If you tried it before, TRY IT AGAIN! :D"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place got such good reviews, it was awful!  Both the chicken fingers and the wings were rubbery and overcooked with no flavor. The fries were oily and overcooked as well with a strange almost sugary taste. Paid 17 dollars for 2 combos we barely ate."}
{"text":"Way below average.  They forgot half my order. The wings were small and not meaty. The sauces were not tasty.  We couldn't even tell which sauce was which after tasting them. The prices were decent for wings, but not these wings. Don't think people who gave this restaurant a good review have ever had a wing before.  Best part of the meal was the coleslaw. Maybe that's what they should rename the restaurant."}
{"text":"First timer...but definitely not my last !! Chicken delish!! Customer service the best and that's important. I like to support the small business owners."}
{"text":"This is my run to spot when i have a craving fot wings. Suki the manager is super nice and always greets with you with a smile. Wings are great and so are the fries. Best place to go when you got a craving for the cheap"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place because \"wingstop\" is so far away from my house . Anywho while ordering my wings I asked for them to be \"WET\" (extra saucy) and I received dry wings . Also for 6 wings and soggy fries I think $10.54 was a bit expensive. The owner was working the register and she had one other person working the register and making food which I thought was pretty unsanitary. The wings over all were okay. But I will NOT visit again ."}
{"text":"I was out today looking for small business that I could perhaps give them a  opportunity of catering some up coming events. I came by WINGS restaurant.  BIG MISTAKE!!!!.. The wings was small, no flavor and under cook. The owner was the one to take my order as well as cook my wings. I call back to give some feedback from my experience, the manager was very aggressive and loud asking me what do  I wanted. I told her I don't want anything not even my money back. I try to say something else and she hang up the phone on me. I call back she will not answer the phone. I call back again using my husband phone and she answer once she knew I was on the phone she hung up the phone again. I was not going to write a review on yelp but after she was so disrespectful and so unprofessional I felt I had to. The very sad part about this people just don't know what business opportunities they can miss out on. To the owner I really hope that your business will continue to strive and become a household name ( BWW, Wing Stop). Maybe in the future we can do some business together. I only good thing that came out of this today I was able to feed a homeless man with your wings. So with that being said Thank You!"}
{"text":"Well when I walked in I was greeted by the single employee / owner and she was very friendly and help me navigate the menu. I ordered the 3 and 1/2 lb Wings family combo which came out to be a little over $30. After she prepared the wings which was lemon pepper and buffalo hot she showed them to me and seem very excited to serve the food. I immediately noticed the fries were dark brown and discolored probably from being cooked in old oil but I didn't have the heart to say can I have a refund, i just said mmm thats good lol. The wings barely had any seasoning on them at all it looked like there was a couple drops of hot sauce on each wing for the buffalo hot and the lemon pepper was pretty sparsely season as well. I I bit into a couple of the Wings and they were still dark red and bloody on several of them so I threw it in the trash. I'm just going to chalk up the money as donating to this lady as I really wanted this place to be good but I think there are more than one thing broken here, i.e. sanitation, burnt oil, and not putting sauce on wings.Avoid this just go to Buffalo Wild Wings or make the trip to Wingstop. I hope I don't get sick :("}
{"text":"Not impressed. Staffed not really happy to see us walk in for some reason. Wings seemed undercooked but weren't."}
{"text":"The bad reviewers simply don't know their wings. These are the best wings in town & the owner is a very nice lady who loves her customers. The fries are amazing as well, never quite tasted any fries like them. If you like heat go ahead & get the spiciest flavor because none of them are super hot but the flavor is amazing. I would recommend lemon pepper. if you're questioning going here don't hesitate, never had a bad experience"}
{"text":"I love wings.  Living in North Carolina, I used to have wings at least a couple of times a week.  These wings are really the best I've ever had.  I usually order the garlic parmesan wings.  They are crispy, juicy, and full of garlic parmesan flavor as described.  I've tried garlic parmesan at other places such as Wing Stop, BWW, Chicken Shack, Wing Street/Pizza Hut, just to name a few and this place is my #1 go to spot for wings.  Despite the negative reviews, you have to try this place before you say no!"}
{"text":"The exact wings that you think of when you are thinking about wings. The owner is a spitfire who is very friendly and made our visit quite pleasant. There are lots of sauces to choose from and with a comfortable setting it makes this place a chicken wing staple for locals in the area."}
{"text":"When Wing Stop is to busy and you don't wanna cook. Want some great wings for football game here's your secret spot."}
{"text":"Great wings for very affordable prices! Wings and tenders available, and their fries are home made.

There are Daily Specials available, along with lunch specials. It is run by a sweet lady. Maybe I would not dine in here, but the food is good. These wings are awesome :)"}
{"text":"Saw a bunch of negative reviews and was skeptical to try, even just to critique. I was positively surprised with some of the best wings anywhere in this area. 
Jumbo-sized wings that you dont see anywhere, and cooked perfectly crispy, just as requested.
The 'Original Buffalo Wing' sauce which is considered 'Medium' on their scale was regular wing sauce and was the mildest of mild. Not a bad thing at all for those that prefer mild, but I was looking for a lot more spice with a 'Medium'.

Overall the wings were the best quality that I have tried anywhere in South Vegas/Henderson, when researching Wings for a Best Wings website."}
{"text":"Amazing service! The staff is nice, genuine, and even funny! The wings... PERFECT. Their fries are also phenomenal."}
{"text":"I have ejoyed this place. It is deceptively good..the food, the service, and the staff all contribute to make this a favorite wing place. Don't judge this place by its decor. There is much more to this place than meets the eye."}
{"text":"The wings were not all that great. But they weren't bad either. The customer service could have been better . The 2 guys behind the counter just looked nervous for some odd reason especially the guy that was ringing me up, every just seemed off.  Told me My order will by ready about 15 minutes but I ended up waiting over 30 minutes. 49¢ plus tax for a half way full ranch. This was my first time at this place and it will be my last. I'm sticking to BWW. And on top of that they use styrofoam cups that were possibly bought from the 99¢ store up the street. HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"The best wings in town, hands down.

The service is always great, and the wings are even better. No fancy menu here, but some great flavors for perfectly cooked chicken wings. I highly recommend the Hot Garlic and the Lemon Pepper for a good mix of spicy and non-spicy.

As a big bonus, the owner donates all tips to local charities (Safe Nest, St. Jude's, and others)"}
{"text":"Prior to tonight's experience I believe I would have rated this place 3 stars. Tonight was just the icing on the cake for me and I will no longer be coming here. During our first experience a few months back we waited almost 45 minutes for some chicken tenders and fries. At the end of the day however the food was alright. The fries have a great seasoning and the tenders tasted almost buttered and were so good. Although we had to wait the food was good enough to want to come back. I came again a few months after and this time the wait wasn't as long and the food was once again really good. So that leads me to tonight. I was craving chicken tenders so my husband and I packed up the kids and headed over. We ordered the usual, two #2's. This usually comes with 7 tenders per basket as well as fries. Altogether we should have received 14 tenders and a good amount of fries. This would have been more than enough food for the kids and myself being that my husband wanted food next door. We waited about 15 minutes for our food. When we received our food we were presented with two baskets. In each basket there were 6 pieces of chicken, not tenders, I mean small little nuggets that you can tell were clearly tenders cut in half. You can see the cuts in the tenders. We paid $25+ for two basket combos and an additional drink. In reality we only got a total of six tenders cut in half split into two baskets. We brought it to the workers attention and she said that \"that's how they come\". We even showed her the picture on her wall and she reiterated that that is how they came. She then gave us one additional tender caught in half. What a joke. Never again."}
{"text":"I have to give some love to my girl, Suki.  She is the best.  We throw a party once a year and always go to Wings and have her provide about 15-20 pounds of wings.  Let me tell you what, there is nothing but bones left after the party.  Her wings have more meat than her corporate counterparts and you get more wings for a better price.  Suki tells me every time I order the \"Hellfire\" that it is way too hot, but I think they are perfect.  Yet again, I am a spicy guy.  Each time I go in, Suki jokingly threatens to retire.  Let's support this business and delay Suki's retirement as long as possible."}
{"text":"Very friendly with great service, the food is delicious.  I eat there at least once a week, I have used them to cater an event for work before as well.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Maybe it was the 15 minute wait for the freshly fried wings.  Maybe it was the business plan I was conveyed by the nice young lady behind the counter who informed of the four locations in the valley (that I have never seen aside from this one).  Maybe it was the hard sell of \"our most popular flavors\" that fell way short.  Maybe it was the structure of pricing wings BY THE POUND. Or maybe because it was EMPTY when I walked in.

This is your average wing shack.  Better than Flavor Flav's House of Horrors, but certainly not a top shop.  Maybe I will try another visit to see if their other flavors aside from Buffalo, Lemon Pepper and Garlic Parmesan can appease my tastebuds."}
{"text":"Gotta add Wings to my very short list of 2018 regrets. Came in really close to closing, and the lovely little lady working (owner possibly) was super friendly and pleasant. Her nice demeanor earns the 2 stars.

After waiting 15 min for a #1 combo (4 wings, 2 chicken strips, fries, 1 dip, and a drink for $8.99), I was dismayed to find that my wings were barely warm, while the fries were mouth-scorchingly hot with a weird thick mushy consistency inside, and the chicken fingers were somewhere in between on temperature. Not to mention, the chicken barely looked or tasted like it had ever met any sauce. While the wings were a decent size, they were ultra bland. Fingers were Sam's Club frozen out the bag style, so no redemption there.

Usually a place like this with kitschy mom & pop vibes really brings it with the food, but Wings falls wayyyy short. Had high hopes, but probably won't be back unless I want to buy one of the random watercolor birthday cards next to the register."}
{"text":"I WOULD NEVER EAT HERE !! The owners was so rude & was yelling at me in the parking lot . I parked in their reserved spot so I could place a catering order  but they were not open yet , so I decided to just go to Jimmy John's next door & buy a bottle of water .  As I was leaving I noticed a lady in an old beat up white pickup truck almost hitting the door of my new car . I asked her to be careful & she yelled at me & said , \" YOU SHOULD NOT BE PARKED HERE !\" I told her I was going into the Wing place , but they were closed . She continued to yell at me & tel me that parking spot is just for Wings Restaurant. I got in my car & she still hit my car with empty gallon water bottles she was getting out of her truck. I told her & she said I should be moving my car.  I will not be going back in there to place my catering order . This lady was RUDE & doesn't deserve my business ."}
{"text":"Orderd the #1 buffalo Hot. The wings were cooked good but the Buffalo Hot had no kick at all and not to good of a flavor. Ths fries were ok could of been cooked alittle more. If the Buffalo had a better kick and the fries were cooked alittle more then i would go back maybe if i do go back i will ask for buffalo with extra sauce and to have the fries cooked alittle more then see how it goes for the 2nd round."}
{"text":"First time my brother brought me here, the wings were awesome. I said, I'd come back again and here I am again... sort of a tradition now.. I love local restaurants and stores!"}
{"text":"Family owned with five locations.  Wings are made to order and phenomenal.  At least ten flavors and quantities from ten to 500.  I've started ordering wings for holiday parties, and these are about three times as good as the competition right down the street, and they are about 1/3 cheaper.  This is my new place and I don't have to look anymore."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here. We ordered a number 2 which was a 2lb meal, about 14-16 wings or so. I got the Cajun buffalo and my husband got the hot buffalo. Honestly probably the best wings we've ever had. The Cajun buffalo sauce was outstanding, it was buffalo sauce and a Cajun dry rub! Wow!! Suki the woman working ( she is the owner ) is extremely sweet. She was very personable, and kind. I wasn't feeling well before we ate, so she cut up an apple for me to help settle my stomach. I will definitely be returning every time I have a craving for wings! Oh! Also, she uses fresh cut potatoes for her French fries. They were also good."}
{"text":"First time visitor and I couldn't have been happier! The wings were a good size and the homemade fries are delicious! Food is made to order so you get everything hot and fresh! The woman that works here is so nice and ask if it is your first visit, if so she tells you about the menu and their popular flavors. Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch and had the Parmesan Garlic wings.  They were delicious, I am came back after work and ate them again along with the Teriyaki wings.  Suki was nice and very courteous.  

I will be back if I visit the area again.  5 stars for the great flavor of the Parmesan Garlic wings.  They were hot, crispy, had meat on them and came out with great flavor."}
{"text":"I liked the wings here, fried nice and crispy.  The service was friendly and yeah there is a wait but that's fine, I want my wings fresh out of the fryer.  Minus one star for the price - $6.99 for 1 lb and I got 7 wing pieces, so at a buck a wing, that's kind of expensive.  The wings are better than BWW though so if I crave some wings, I will be back here."}
{"text":"The wings here are just okay. The fries are soggy and the place makes you eat out of 1 to go container even if you have multiple people on your group. They don't give you separate plates for your orders. They also charge you for everything and have instructional signs for their employees all over the restaurant in plain view of the patrons. 

The most confusing thing though:
Why do they sell greeting cards at the register!? \"I'm hungry for some wings...oh perfect! A get well card for Nana. Can I get this and an 8 piece of mild wings to go?\"

Hooters is honestly better and around the same price."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place to order wings. They always taste delicious and the customer service goes above and beyond any other place. A must to try!!"}
{"text":"This place ok, just ok, the wings were ok, the fries were ok, nothing to write home about. The prices were not so great either. Also its a thing with me, a wing joint should not charge extra for blue cheese dressing or for celery/carrot sticks. All in all there are better wings out there, now go and find them! Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"I gave 5 stars for this spot cause not only was the food great but the service was excellent. I believe this little asian lady runs it and when I mean \"run it\" like she does everything! Chicken was well flavored and I like the seasoning on the fries too. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came in right before closing, thinking I was going to be rushed. To my surprise, the lady was patient with me and even helped me decide what I really wanted to order. So, I decided on wings,fries, dipping sauces and of course carrots sticks. There is a nice selection of wing flavors you can choose from. I got the highly recommended lemon pepper, bbq, and traditional buffalo. All three were very flavorful. The wings are a good size and were meaty. Fries are fresh and cut there. I took everything to go, and my food was piping hot!! Value for price is on point as well as flavor and customer service. Very friendly which is hard to find now on days !!! Will definitely be back !!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service! My boyfriend and I came in to get wings and we got the lemon pepper and garlic parm. They were very good. The boy behind the counter was so polite and helpful. The cook was great too! We'll definitely be back and would consider them for catering."}
{"text":"Meh... this place was so-so.  We called in ahead of time and placed order and was told 15 minutes. I waited a few minutes before I left house and went to pharmacy to pick up a few items and by the time I got to Wings I paid and they told be \"11 minutes\"... ok so I waited... the cashier was super friendly and the lady cook was nice as well... yelling at me that the order would be ready soon, but seriously super friendly and upbeat. When the order was ready the guy asked me if I had paid yet? I ensured them I did . When I got home we found the the Wings were just ok. Got the Cajun and the lemon pepper flavors. The flavor was decent but not as good as BWW or as add on to our local pizza place. The fries were very thick and cold and hard to swallow and the blue cheese dip for the Wings was so runny that could not make it to
Your mouth without dripping. The service was great, but I was hoping for great wings:( I wouldn't try again, neither would I recommend."}
{"text":"The hot Buffalo isn't hot at all and the spicy garlic didn't taste like anything but fried wings.  Fits the standard of \"wings\", but you won't impress your guests if you bring these."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I have been here and not much has changed since my last review.  At lunch time ONE person working in the place, will never figure that out.  They cook your food to order so when you have one person running everything, 14 minutes for an order of wings starts once all orders are taken if you are not the only one walking in the door.

We were the second of three and it took almost a half hour to get 16 wings and fries.  The wings were smaller I. Size then I remember, the fries were ok.

With all the places in town to get wings, this is one place I will not rush back too.  The guy was nice but very overwhelmed, the place inside is not large but makes you feel like you are sitting in a grease bowl.  It looks clean but really is not as clean as it should be for a place that serves food.  

In the case up front they had arrowhead water so I ordered one and was told they were not cold that he had to grab a CMX one from the back which turned out to not be an arrowhead water.  I hate to say it but I like to eat in places I feel safe in and I am NOT tracking about location, I'm talking about health safety and this place is just NOT one of them I feel safe eating in."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. After seeing the great reviews we decided to call in an order of wings and fries to go. My husband had to drive down there and bring them home only to be so let down that we threw them all away. The wings and fries smelled like rancid oil. You couldn't eat them without the gross smell."}
{"text":"We were gonna get Buffalo Wild Wings but the wings were always small. I wanted to try something new.

So I searched Yelp and looked up Wings. Wings restaurant popped up first. So we decided to give it a try. 

We ordered 3.5 pounds of garlic parm wings, large fries and medium buttermilk ranch. I was shocked on how big the wings were. But the fries and ranch were so tasty.

The service was excellent, she told me to try a French fry and it was so hot. She opened the ranch and made me dip the fry in and cool my mouth lol. I was sold!

Thank you Wings!"}
{"text":"These Wings are amazing I have been coming here for the past 7 years!!!! They make them crispy like I like em, and the flavors are bomb!! Favorite here is HELL FIRE  it's spicy but you can taste actual flavor unlike many other wing spots , Suki is amazing !!!! She's been serving the community years now!!! She's so kind !!! They used to have some all over the valley but having one person do all is tough so I understand why she had to stick to one ....even though it's a little far out it's worth the drive !!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite wings place in this area.  The service and food are exceptional. Love Suki!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend spoke big about this place. Once I got there and ate the entire meal I came to the conclusion that the chicken shack aka chicken bonz is better. She also stated that there was a different cook last time she went and it was better. This time around it was a short hispanic lady that made it. The fries weren't crispy. They were actually soggy and hot. the wings were something that I could have made at home but 10x better. The best thing was the orange crush pop. 

Overall I would prefer to make the drive to the sunset  chicken shack because after reading the review for the shack on maryland. I won't be going there either. I would be willin to try this place again if its a differnt cook."}
{"text":"Five stars because of the hard working employee, food, and price. Everything is made to order. There was only one employee working... She took the order and made the food for my family of six, and she had other customers... Without a complaint... I was relieved. Always tip her generously!"}
{"text":"I stopped into Wings in Henderson while my truck was being worked on at Midas, which is in the same mall. From the moment I walked in, I was glad I did. The woman behind the counter (who I later found out was the owner) was very much present, interested in her customers and of course, friendly. She asked if I'd ever eaten there before. I had not. So she explained a few things to me about the food (all homemade fresh) and the different flavors and heat levels, which I appreciated. 

I had my wings in two flavors: Cajun kickers (respectably hot and spicy) and Hot Garlic (delicious, if you love garlic...I was drooling). The french fries were long, thick and square-cut, seasoned with some (secret?) home blend that just had me woofing 'em down.  : )  

Truth is, I am not a big wings guy but these were delicious and the genuinely friendly service was a huge plus and would definitely bring me back for more."}
{"text":"I'm a huge chicken wing fan always on the look out for a great wing place. Based on reviews, decided to try this place. For me the spicier the better. So I ordered \"hellfire\". Lady even gives me a warning. As usual, I scoff. Get home filled with anticipation, \"hellfire\" wings are bland, tasteless no spice at all, very disappointing. \"Buffalo hot\" equally bland and boring. Fries are black and burned. Terrible. Try Hot Dog Heaven for great golden crispy fries. Chicken tender is an over-breaded dry turd. Disgusting. Too many awesome wing places in town to waste your time and money for this tasteless muck."}
{"text":"Great little family run wing place where the chicken is made with love. The wings are huge and soooo crispy, and I want to try every flavor. 

I usually feel great bowel distress after eating at chain wing places that shall remain nameless. I felt just plain great after eating here. Real food made well for great prices? Safe to say I'll be back."}
{"text":"Winging it, and should have flown away.

Tried this place today, and got here at about 5:00 pm. I was the only one here.

1.  Service - Not bad when you are the only one here. However, the servers must be busy, because there is a ton of grease on their shirts. I may suggest to wear aprons however.

2.  Selection - Very nice - good choice of sauces, flavors, spice levels, fries, chicken fingers, boneless and basic wings.

3.  Size of wings - Well, we all know that Grade A USDA Wings are plump and very meaty \"well to moderately fleshed\".  We also know that Grade B wings have a sufficient amount of flesh to prevent a thin appearance.  Guess what, we got a B here. You want your humans beings Grade B, and your wings Grade A.  COME ON FOLKS.....

4.  Price - The price for 50 wings is 29.99 which is not bad, if it were grade A wings. you  would expect 50 wings to be somewhat heavy, I felt as if I was holding a bunch of ballons. Served in a generic container in a generic bag, not sure how this helps with their branding.

6.  Taste - edible!  The polynesian style had an odd dark color, yet the flavor was acceptable.  The Garlic Parmesan, well, there was garlic taste and parmesan taste, just unfortunately a smattering and not well covered.

7.  Tables - Plenty of room in this place, you can sit and eat as well. Odd that people just walk in and out of the back room without any uniform or acknowledgement. You don't know who works here or not.  I don't plan to eat in anytime soon, a bit dodgy if you ask me.

Overall, I would say that for a  hungry person, these wings are definitely acceptable and you can compare it to ordering a hamburger at McDonalds. Compared to In and Out of Five guys, there is no comparison, however, it is certainly edible.  Hey, if you need 500 wings, this is the place to try."}
{"text":"Worst wings and strips I have ever had. How can someone mess up wings and strips. I should say the highlight was the Pepsi. Warning one the menu on the wall has been taped over. You can tell they have dropped quantity and raised prices. So in other words they are not making money. I just ate one strip and one wing an threw the rest of my 20 dollar meal away. I'm hoping I don't get food poisoning. The strips were not done, the wings had zero flavor. The fries were greasy and flaccid. I HIGHLY recommend you don't go here, ever!"}
{"text":"It was just ok. I dropped by for lunch and got a pound of wings to split with my brother. It wasn't great but they weren't bad. I've had better hot wings. When they are this big, I really like them more crispy.  They were a bit mushy. Flavor was ok. Again,  not bad but not good. Service was ok. It was pretty clean. Would I return?  If a friend was paying I might try them out again and request extra crispy."}
{"text":"I got the western bbq wings, the flavor was amazing i loved the taste  (im not a big bbq fan) however a couple of the wings were mainly bone and gristle and i love cole slaw but the cole slaw here was too thick and not enough flavor, a little watery tasting ( i love the slaw at canes! ) for the price id rather go to buffalo wild wings"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh! First time going here and I'll definitely be back. Love the flavor of the fries too!YUM! Just Yum! Lol"}
{"text":"This place is just ok. The sauces are not very favorable  at all. I got hot and sweet and spicy teriyaki and neither of them were spicy. The fries are soggy and the seasoned fries also lack flavor. The staff was very nice that's why I gave two stars."}
{"text":"Wings are my all time favorite food. This comes in second on my list of favorite places to order them! Yes, the building is fairly small and could probably use a little dusting around the TVs but their selections, their flavor, the size of their wings and the quality make up for that. Gotta try the Hell Fire and Cajun Kickers wings!!!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with amazing customer service I was greeted by an amazing older asian lady, sadly didn't get her name. ):
She made me feel very welcomed. She made recommendations on the food and I bought the Lemon Pepper and they were cooked to perfection! 
Recommend this place because customer service makes a difference, the food is great on top of that!"}
{"text":"My mom likes this place. They make her wings just the way she likes. The charge you by the pound so for roughly $10 you get 6 wings. I think that's a tad pricey other than that- it's good to go."}
{"text":"This place was made out to be the best wing place you have ever been to by the lady working. She was sadly mistaking about the quality of her wings. They were awful. At the time of eating at this place I was pretty hungry and things normally taste better when you are hungry not this meal. My wings were dripping in oil at the bottom of my container. The homemade ketchup was terrible and the fries were terrible to. My Parmesan wings just had sprinkled Parmesan on top. Do yourself a favor and go the 0.5 miles to Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"First time here for an out of towner! This place has the best wings. Made to order, right there and it's not as salty as WingStop or Wingerz or even Buffalo Wild Wings. The place definitely has a local vibe to it. Been in business for 17 years; too bad the owner is retiring soon and selling the place."}
{"text":"I went in around 3:30 today and there was only one person besides myself eating in. 

The specials are written on a white board and seem somewhat decently priced, the look however seems very sloppy and the specials were a little hard to read. 

I ordered the 8 boneless wing special with a drink and fries for $8.43 with a Cajun hot flavor. 

I was a little perturbed that the woman asked me multiple times what drink I wanted and still didn't give it to me until my wings were finished (guess they try to avoid having to give you a refill before your food is done). 

I took my order to go, the fries were absolutely terrible, they were soggy and wet, and a weird dark brown color. Also I found their blue cheese to be very watery and bland. 

The best part of the order was the wings, I'm not used to a dry rub but these were pretty good and seasoned very well. These don't seemed fried like normal wings, and the spice I picked wasnt as spicy as I expected since it got a 4/5 rating on the spice chart. 

All in all I appreciate small businesses and admire the people who take the chance to start them. I think with some small changes this place can be really good. If you're in the mood for wings, that's all I would order from this place."}
{"text":"Was craving some wings so I came to Wings  Restaurants. It was my first time going there and the one staffer working was very helpful and patient with me while I looked over the menu. 

I decided to order 2lbs of wings, fries, celery and carrots. It didn't take that long for my order, about a 15 minute wait. Had a pleasant conversation with the staffer. She was very friendly and helpful...  

The wings and fries  were delicious! Will definitely go back! There's lots of flavors to choose from and planning on trying all of them..."}
{"text":"Love the wings here I think i tried ever flavor  they have.  Great for family take out but it's a small space if u wanna eat there.  Staff and ower are friendly and kind."}
{"text":"Spent a little over $45 on 2 boxes of wings (5 lb.) and only got a little over a tablespoon of Ranch dressing (dip). I think this place is a rip off........ But, the wings were tasty."}
{"text":"My food smells like heaven!! Service is so sweet and friendly... This spot is a good one.. 4 thumbs up...."}
{"text":"Place is a bit small but the friendly stuff and the good food make the up. The wings from this place is is better the most places that wings. Takes 15 minutes for the wings to cook but that cuz they are made fresh to order and fries are homemade too. I really like their funnel fries for dessert. If you get a chance to try this place I said do it!!! It's worth the time.."}
{"text":"Juicy and crispy wings made to order. Crispy fries with seasoning was perfect. I had the buffalo and garlic and parmesan wings that went perfectly with their buttermilk ranch. Very attentive and friendly lady that works there."}
{"text":"First of all let me state that I LOVE chicken wings!! I have been wanting to try try this place since I saw their sign when I moved to the area. I kept putting it off usually just going to Buffalo Wild Wings just up the street since I love their asian zing flavor. Well tonight I figured I'd call in an order for pick up  since I was gonna be driving by on my way home. I called ahead of time and placed a pick up order for 1lb of spicy teriyaki wings with a side of ranch. When I got to the restaurant it was empty with just one employee working, no big deal, the gentleman working was a nice/funny guy. Driving home I felt like I smelled a little bit of a sour smell coming from the take out box so I was a little worried, so I got home and tried them thankfully there is no sourness thankfully. One pound ended up being 7 wings with the price tag of $8.10 after tax so not bad. Anyway, after digging in I gotta say I'm a little disappointed, maybe it was just my choice of sauce/flavoring but they just tasted bland, and the spicy teriyaki had no spice at all and didn't get much of a teriyaki flavor either. They're really nice meaty crunchy wings which is pretty much on point, but the flavor is disappointing there's just not that much flavor. Maybe I'll give this place another chance with a different flavor cause I really do want to like this place so I don't have to only rely on Bdubs little baby wings. I wish we had a Wing Stop in our area but we don't. Final thought, I would try this place out with a small order before ordering your Super Bowl platter from here, again the wings themselves were nice and meaty and crunchy it was just flavor that disappointed."}
{"text":"The owner of this restaurant does not give the employees there share of tips that are put on debit cards even if she's not working the night shift she keeps the employees tips !!!! I know she gives money to st Jude's but what right does she have to keep the employees tips NO RIGHT AT ALL BUT SHE  DOES !!! 
Sure the food is good but being that greedy is a horrible thing and the way she treats her employees is horrible"}
{"text":"It's a cute small place and the woman who runs it is the sweetest person, also customer service is great. Best wing place I've been to totally recommend coming here!!!"}
{"text":"The wings were decent but the staff seemed bothered.  The place has a funky smell to it and they left the front door open so it was cold."}
{"text":"I was skeptical due to previous reviews, but I was at the door and it was the only open place nearby. The staff was pleasant and friendly, walk me through the menu and offered combo suggestions. They even offered sauce samples to try-out before placing my order. The wings were great. The \"Hot & Sweet\" flavor was great. Good price standpoint. They charge by pound, not by pieces. Approximately 7 to 8 wings per pound (big wings). Will definitively come back."}
{"text":"I feel bad having to reduce Wings to 2 stars, but I just cant come back here. The fries on my last visit were completely undercooked and limp. It was raw inside and they were an unappetizing brown color that others have mentioned. 

The wings were cooked okay, but really lacked flavor. I still have an issue charging high prices for ranch or blue cheese as well. Unfortunately there are much better options around so I wont be returning."}
