{"text":"Chose this place as it was closest to the boat dock I took.  I liked the water patio location and breeze by the trees.  The hostes i agree was extrememly rude and wanted to seat us in a sun filled corner outside.  we moved tables and had a friendly server.  It is pricey but the food was great with many vegetarian choices.  I had the veggie dog and it was really good."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a 0 star. Spinach dip was disgusting and deep fried for some reason. Lots of wasps and service was terrible!! The bill was 50 bucks for two and we weren't even full."}
{"text":"the worst experience ever. rude service. slow, dirty washrooms. bad food. and the free refill drink we asked for was given to us in dirty cup full of one large chunk of ice and yellowish color coke cola or god know what"}
{"text":"Avoid this place if you can. The service was very slow. Our waitress seemed disinterested in how we were. They brought my beer, and then a minute later another waitress brought me another beer - OOPS! I only ordered one!

The food wasn't memorable. The french fries were oven baked and under done. Do they not have a deep fryer? If you are serving pub food (which is what this place does), you NEED deep fryers. My fries reminded me of something I might make in my toaster oven out of desperation on a Saturday night.

A hot dog meal (dog, fries, a sad, small pile of coleslaw) costs $9. The kids meal is $10, and includes choice of entree (my kids had pizza), a beverage, and ice cream.

The only reason I would ever stop in again is if I needed a quick beer at the bar."}
{"text":"Some of the slowest, most disinterested service I have ever encountered. Nothing improved after I complained, either. The host in particular needs a serious change in attitude.

Food is overpriced and of poor quality. My pasta tasted as if was subjected to a literal bucketful of pepper. I didn't realise it was possible to screw up spaghetti bolognese that badly.

Washrooms are disgusting. 

Never again."}
{"text":"This place is so bad that if it was in the city it would have been gone a long time ago.
Service is slow. Took over five minutes to get anyone to come to the table. Ordered a soup (something that they don't have to cook), they took the order and then in 30 ... THIRTY! minutes they came back saying they don't have the soup. Thanks so much."}
{"text":"Location is delightful, service was good, and the kids' meal was reasonably priced. The food was better than I expected - not gourmet, but better than snack bar basics!

On the downside, the adult entrees were expensive, and the decor inside wasn't much to look at. But why would anyone want to sit inside?

I'll definitely be back - our lunch at the Carousel was a lovely part of a great day."}
{"text":"Pretty funny that the only other review of this place is also from today - maybe we were sitting in the same section?  Anyway, I was at this place earlier this afternoon.  Upon arrival we were greeted by a humorless \"hostess\" who dumped us at our table without a word.  Our server seemed pleasant enough, but when the food came our opinions changed for the worse.  The \"Canadian Fries\" looked as though they had been sitting out on the counter for an hour, complete with lukewarm, limp fries, congealed cheese and stale bacon bits.  The BLT was pretty much inedible, with way too much dry ciabatta and barely any of the actual lettuce, tomato and what I assume was instant microwave bacon.  Barely touched any of it.  Waited forever for the server to come back, but she didn't, so we got tired of waiting and went looking for the bill.  Found her sitting in the back reading a book??  Finally got the bill which was a staggering $45 for 2 sandwiches, a plate of fries and 3 pops.  Talk about a tourist trap.  Oh, and the washroom floor was soaking wet with who knows what.

Anyway, word to the wise, Toronto tourists and residents: DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"After reading the previous reviews we hesitantly thought we would take a chance and give the place a try. The service was excellent we were seated very quickly on the patio and our drinks order was taken straight away.
The food menu is the usual fast food type menu and as previously stated aimed at family or groups of friends . The chicken fillet sandwich with jerk sauce and sweet potato fries we ordered were cooked well , did not take long to arrive so it was not a bad experience overall!"}
{"text":"Bad service comes included in every meal. 
Staff are bored out of their mind and have no interest in their job."}
{"text":"Undercooked burger

Service was ok

Prices were a $$$ not a $$ as yelp suggests..

I'd go here(location/service) for a beer again not to dine."}
{"text":"Some key points for I don't feel this place warrants a long review.

- Over priced
- Sat us outside without asking preference.
- Extremely outdated. Pepto-pink walls.
- Freezer fresh taste to the fries.
- Washrooms were disgusting.

Didn't want to waste money on low quality food. Got yam fries and water. About right quality for the only thing open during non-peak months."}
{"text":"My family and I had the worst experience in this restaurant. We came here on a Thursday afternoon. It was absolutely not busy. We requested to be seated outside and it took about 15 minutes to be seated although there were seats ready outside. It was a hot summer day but our table was soaked. They couldn't bother to bus the table. We ordered mostly pitchers of beer seeing as it's mid-afternoon we were just looking for refreshing beer and snacks. The server just took away our empty cups and handed the bill right away. We still wanted more beer. The server never asked if we wanted more beer. She just handed the bill and asked if we needed change. NOBODY IN THE GROUP ASKED FOR THE BILL. 

Also, the restaurant was disgusting. Nobody cleans the washrooms. Toronto Islands is a beautiful tourist attraction; however, you don't get a real Canadian experience with this restaurant. As a Canadian, I take pride in the fact that we are courteous and civilized. This restaurant is filled with ill-mannered and incompetent staff. I discourage anybody from coming here. It's absolutely not worth it. I would not eat here again even if it becomes the only restaurant in the Island. 

Visited on: Thursday, June 28th 2015 @ 4:18 - served by Server #7."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible dining experience. The service is SLOW and RUDE. The place wasn't even that busy and we waited an 1.5 hours for food while other tables that came in after us were served ahead of us.

Peaked into kitchen out on my way out of bathroom -- NASTY. There's gotta be some health code violations.

Our food was cold and flavorless. Simply put: horrible.

DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what you'd expect. It's smack dab in the middle of Tourist Island, therefore the options are boring and overpriced.

The only saving grace is that the service was good. Also, they had beer.

A group of us dropped in here after paddling to the island, so we were famished. We ordered regular and turkey burgers, onion rings, fries, jerk chicken and chicken fingers. None of us were all that impressed with the food. My burger was definitely the frozen variety. I know because I've purchased it at the grocery store before. It's cut into the shape of a cloud to simulate hand-formed patties. 

All in all, it made me regret not packing a picnic lunch for the day."}
{"text":"Food is meh but the service is fast and the patio view is top 5 in the city."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin. First of all I'd like to say this is my third time here, but I haven't been in the past 3 years. It has plummeted. I never leave reviews, or don't leave tips but this service and food deserved both. We were a party of 2 who waited 25 minutes to be seated in a less then half empty restaurant at 3pm on Victoria Day. They had at least 8 staff working at the front of house, so there was no reason why we couldn't be seated. To boot there isn't any service! You go up to a table and order your food, and pay for it before it is even begun to be made. My partner went up to the bar to get our drinks (because they don't bring any to you) and waited 15 minutes while one grumpy rude man served drinks. He continuously ignored him, and went to the other 2 people standing at the bar. It's not like it was busy at all with 2-3 standing at the bar wanting one drink at a time. I watched him pour and dump out a beer 5 times before giving it to the customer. RIDICULOUS!! 1 1/2 hour later, we receive our food. We order a simple burger and fries, jalepeno poppers, and a vegetarian flat bread pizza. The burger was cheap and made from frozen but decent, jalepeno poppers tasted good, the pizza was pathetic. A flat bread pizza advertised as having spinach, onion, cheese, tomato, and olive oil came as pictured below. It was a cheese and oregano pizza topped by a salad. The ingredients should have been baked into the pizza, but no. The pizza was cold and had way too much oregano, and topped by a greasy spinach salad doused in sour salad dressing was absolutely revolting. We received no cutlery, napkins, water, or anyone asking us how our meal went. We paid a total of $60 for all of that food and barely touched half of it. Extremely disappointed on the service, cheap frozen misleading food, and lack of organization and personable ness. This used to be a great place with good sandwiches and burgers and great typical service! They are trying to be different but the place is a total trail wreck."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and never step foot in this place. 

My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to grab a quick cup of tea on the island because it was late in the afternoon and the temperature was dropping. 

We were immediately seated at an extremely dirty table that did not look like it had been cleaned in a few days. We then proceeded to wait a good 15 minutes for service even though there were only two tables out on the patio and one table indoors (ours). 

We also both got up to go to the bathroom (also disgusting) at various times during our wait and walked right by the servers booth, where the servers were congregating to gossip-- it's not like we did not make ourselves invisible. 

We eventually called over the \"host\" who feigned surprise that we had not been served and called over our waitress. 

Our waitress approached the table and said--without a smile or a greeting-- \"What are you having.\" 

We asked for two cups of tea and she then said that we could actually help ourselves at the self-serve coffee/tea table near the entrance. After we made our tea, we waited another 10 minutes for the waitress to print the bill.

I basically made a Yelp account to write this review so nobody else has to go through this weird \"dining\" experience. It seems as if the place is run by a group of teenagers who really don't care about the impression they leave on their customers."}
{"text":"Every time you deal with a business or people in service industry  who have 100% job security , dont expect a good service. , This place is a good example, I do not know who oversee their operation and business practice but for all reason, they are the worst for serving their customers.
just past week , in a weekday , my wife and I stopped at the place which is located in one of gorgeous spot on the island, waited 15 minutes to be seated - while there were no line- and took another 20 minuted to place an order and waited and waited for the food to come. Meanwhile you see waiters and waitresses walking around and a lady ( sounds like she was a manager) shouting at them but no actual food delivery happens. 
finally we gave up and left the place , wasting one hour a very nice sunny day ther. 
Avoid this place, bring your food to the park , and wait may be some one care to change this place."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now, and each time it's left me dissapointed.

The service is slow, even when it's empty.

The food is crap. 

The drinks are meh.

Last time we were here, we just wanted to have a few drinks before biking around...mostly because we didnt want to look too shady drinking from a bottle..in an lcbo bag...but thats besides the point.


The bar rail shots were like 7 dollars. 

They had a list of flavoured daquiris and margaritas. They were 95% ice with a bit of syrup and a touch of alc.

I'll probably come here again based solely on the fact that its one of the only few places on Centre Island."}
{"text":"And when I say \"one star\", I'd actually prefer NO star. Donna, the manager, ruined what would have been a pleasant experience. 

It's your typical fare, the décor has some carousel horses but it's kitschy and the menu is a tad overpriced. A couple of friends and I checked it out cuz we weren't too picky. We were seated outside, the food (calamari and fish and chips) was decent, and they had a few beers available. 

As we finished our meal, it began to rain so we came inside. I paid for the bill, wanting to make sure our server got the tip. We then went to sit at another table so we could split some dessert. 

First off, before we could sit the manager rudely told us to move so she could get through. All right. We sat down awkwardly. The next time she came through she asked to see ID (no waters offered). Okay no problem, we were well in our 20's and 30's. Then she asked us what we wanted and we said we want to split one dessert. She flat out refused and said \"I'm not serving you one, you're three people so you have to get three\". We explained we just had full dinners outside and she said \"yeah I'll let it go\" and walked away. No apologies, no nothing. My friend called her out on being rude, to which the owner replied \"a lot of people are coming in cuz it's raining\". We said that she could have asked us instead of assuming we wouldn't pay and she didn't really have a good answer, just mumbled about us being rude and that she has the right to deny us service. Needless to say, we left without dessert. 

I think the whole situation was poorly managed by the manager. If it's raining outside and people are coming into your nearly empty establishment, being polite might actually entice ppl to order a beer or some food. Furthermore, it's never okay to be rude to patrons, especially after they just paid for full dinners and did nothing offensive. 

No problems with the rest of the staff. But Donna made it horrible enough that I'm urging everyone to keep away from this establishment - terrible service on top of \"meh\" food."}
{"text":"Just do yourself a favor and do not eat here! We were really hungry but could not finish the awful greasy burger or turkey sandwich that came with chicken because they didn't have turkey today! While we had to listen to annoying loud music when having lunch! The quality and taste is reminiscent of shabby gas station diners of 80s!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick place to eat. The kids were hungry after playing at the beach and biking around. We came here and chose to sit outside.

The food here was just so so, typical sandwich/burger kind of place. The only food that stood out was my son's mac-n-cheese. It's baked, not the typical Kraft's packaged looking mac-n-cheese. I guess my son liked it ok. My grilled chicken club sandwich was ok. Fries were salty and plenty. My husband and I ordered some iced tea, which came in a glass with foam on top, and looking kind of red-ish. It turned out the iced tea was sweetened, way too sweet.

The best part of the whole thing had nothing to do with the food. We lucked out and was seated in a prime table, nearest to water, under a big willow tree, with a view to the bridge and people kayaking around. It was quite hot when we were walking around in the sun. But in the shade of the willow tree, it felt cool and relaxing."}
{"text":"Food was good and the service too.  A bit pricey, but what else can you expect from a seasonal business.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Two stars is about on par for this place.  Like most of the place I encountered in Toronto service here was slow.  Also it was a bit expensive $100 for 2 adults and a kids meal including a pitcher of beer.  The burger was solid as was the French fry option but not $18 for a sandwich.  The poutine was okay and had an interesting twist of meatloaf on it which other menu items had as well.  All and all a tourist trap with mediocre food, slow service and prices that are too high.  At least you have a good view."}
{"text":"Over priced!!! The chicken wings were all broken and tasted like they came straight from a long summer in the deep freeze.   Drink beer and don't eat anything if you value your insides."}
{"text":"Yummy onion rings, and outstanding Caesars!
Very good service too"}
{"text":"This past week my wife and I, niece and nephew decided to go to Centreville for a fun day out. Hungry we decided to have a quick lunch here before getting our fun on.

This place has typical quick food, burgers, sandwiches, chicken tenders and the like. The food is satisfying but not exceptional. It's perfect for a sit down lunch with friends or family. The decor could be upgraded, for such a nice spot I'm shocked it's not fancier. This could be because they are trying to appeal to that \"quick lunch\" with the family feel, which they do pull off nicely. So overall not a terrible place, nice views outside, with decent food and friendly staff. The place just seems a little dated, but I don't think you'd be disappointed in dining here."}
{"text":"Looking at the other reviews it seems as though we may have ordered the right thing on the menu: The fish and Chips.

We came in at a non-peak time, the restaurant was about 1/3 full. The server was kind, and didn't look at us funny or get peeved when we ordered a single plate of food for the two of us to share, or when we asked for additional fries to replace the cole slaw that neither of us is a fan of.

Our food took about 15 minutes to come out, which gave us plenty of time to watch a tiny yellow bird attack seagulls mercilessly.

As I walked in I took note of some of the food being served. The sandwiches looked really basic, boorish and unappetizing. The burgers looked pretty good though.

Our fish n chips were pretty decent. The fish itself was very fresh and really tasty, well fried and all. The fries were a little stale. They obviously had been made before our meal and were left sitting, waiting service for someone else. With only 20 patrons at the time, you'd think they could make them fresh with each meal, but...I guess not.

If you drop in here, try the fish n chips. If it is super busy, you may encounter delays. I did note another table having to be apologized to for the wait of their food. Seems odd, however, as there are tons of people working here at any given time it seems."}
{"text":"At 25$ per person this is the worst value in Toronto Island. Don't spoil a great day by eating microwave fast food.

The spinach dip was disgusting. The burger was much worst than a microwave frozen burger. The chicken sandwich was cold and the fish and chip were so gross I was speechless.

Oh! And I almost forgot... This was by far the worst service I've ever experienced in Toronto"}
{"text":"I will give 0 stars if possible. Went around 2:30pm on Victoria Day and the cafe was half full but it took over 45 minutes for my burger and fries to come. Had to ask servers twice and they kept saying 10 mims longer. Had the chorizo burger with fries and the bun was not even toasted. It was dry and cold. The patty was cold too not even warm! Not sure how that can take 45 mins when the place was not even busy. Aleast the fries were hot. And the severs did not bring us water or cutlery. We were so hungry we just went get cutlery ourselves. Do not recommend at all!"}
