{"text":"I had heard about the new steak house and thought I'd try it. It was packed but I was alone so I thought it might not be that long. I wasn't welcomed and when I asked I was told it would be 45 minutes!  It was extremely loud and there was no where to sit I waited 15 minutes and the noise made me decide to go black Angus where I didn't have to wait and it was a much better atmosphere and after reading comments better food too!"}
{"text":"We went for mother's day. We ordered appatizers and they sent them to the table that came in after us. So we had to wait longer on top of the hour wait already to get a table. When we were eating I moved my foot and took a picture with my phone of how much stuff was.under our table..knives a broken flower pot npkins menus and it goes on..very dirty we normally eat at the one in Erie. THIS ONE WE WILL NEVER GO TO AGAIN"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat and has been for years. I figure who better to write a review on Texas Roadhouse than someone with years of experience.   I've never ordered anything that I didn't like.  The food is always well seasoned and tastes great.  Although it's not a meal (wish it was) my favorite thing to eat from here are the green beans.  Instead of getting two different sides with my order I get two orders of green beans!  I have no idea what makes them taste so good.  The only conclusion I've drawn is that they're laced with some type of drug because I'm addicted to them!!   The rolls with cinnamon butter are also delicious.  I've gotten full off of them plenty of times.  On top of the great food the service is also really good.  There are also plenty of tasty treats on the drink menu.  Try the Jamaican Cowboy on for size.  This is a great place to bring your friends and family.  The prices are reasonable and this place should exceed your casual dining expectations.  I know they exceed mine!    Since this is a popular restaurant if you go between 6:30 and 8:30 you may have to wait a bit for a table.  It can get pretty crowded especially on the weekends.  But that should only tell you one thing, Texas Roadhouse is a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Yes this is a chain, but I've never had a tastier $10 steak. I love the sweet potato, salad, & veggies (buttery, somewhat crisp, cooked carrots & broccoli)....& who doesn't enjoy their fresh bread?! I've always received friendly service."}
{"text":"Tonight I went to Texas Roadhouse for dinner, I was extremely excited because this is one of my favorite places to eat. Unfortunately the experience wasn't great. When we were seated we were told they would bring us bread when it was ready, they didn't. My salad came out at least 10 minutes before our appetizer. When our food came out (we still haven't received  our bread)  and the plate did not look appetizing. My pulled pork looked like it was the scraps and there was zero bbq sauce on it. It was so dry. Not once did they ask how the food was or bus the table. When we left out table had every single plate from appetizer to salad bowl. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is fun and has Great Ribs they are tasty and melt off the bone! We had the sweet potato side with marshmallows and it was delicious!! We went here on Black Friday for dinner and it was packed but well worth the 40 min wait! We didn't have reservations so would recommend them next time. Our server Brittany was excellent and kept our drinks refilled without asking her.  We will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Saturday....June 21, 2014..... How does a Texas Roadhouse NOT have baked potato's?? Bad management obviously....or bad corporate policy aggravating the situation by not allowing the manager to just go somewhere and buy potato's."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night. They were busy. The hostess was great. She was extremely friendly. Too bad she wasn't my waitress . I ordered the BBQ grilled chicken and the vegetables and baked potato for my side. I was told they were out of baked potatoes but if I wanted to wait 20 minutes, they would have them. I was getting an appetizer anyway. I said that I could wait. When my meal came, I got mashed potatoes instead. No explanation as to why I got mashed instead of baked. I waited for the waitress to come back and ask if everything was ok and she never did. I could have found somebody and said something but it wasn't worth the trouble. My whole meal was mediocre. The chicken was not that great. The vegetables were terrible. I ate very little of both. Honestly, the mashed potatoes were good but I asked for  a baked potato. I also would like an option of regular butter instead of cinnamon for the rolls. The rolls were good and my margarita was delicious. Not sure if I'd bother to return here again. All in all it was a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"Wife loved the ribs, BBQ chicken was ok. Service was awesome!  We were served by trainee Dawn being trained by Samantha. They were very fun!"}
{"text":"Food was quite good.  Unfortunately, it took a lot of work to get it.  Salad never showed.  Server inquired when the entree was served, then went off to fetch it, returning several minutes later to explain the \"it's a new salad guy\" and suggest I order something else.  OK, how about broccoli?  Another five minutes and the salad shows up.  Well, I guess we eventually got the whole order."}
{"text":"I lived in Champaign over 10 years before I finally tried this place last month for the first time.  I had this \"Ponderosa Steakhouse\" impression of it for some reason and imagined it filled to the brim with rude, tobacco juice-spewing cowboys.  However, the group I went out with wanted to go, so I thought I would try it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  First, the place was packed and very, very loud.  The floor was covered in peanut shells--perfect for my 6-year old who found it thrilling to be able to purposely throw food on the floor.  Score one for appealing to kids.  Then, the rolls came.  Mmmmmmm.  They were heavenly: warm, buttered, with a side of cinnamon butter to go with it.  So delicious on a cold day.    The kid's menu was awesome.  My daughter got the ribs, which were the same size as the half-rack I ordered.  Can you say \"delicious\"?  There are very few times in my life that I've had ribs that fall off the bone and taste the way these did (and I'm a midwest native.)  We ate every bite and were stuffed!  My husband got the full rack and it was a challenge, but he loved it.  Our friends ordered the sweet potato with the marshmallow topping for their side.  It was huge!  That is too sweet for me, but if you like that kind of thing they said it was wonderful.    I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 for the noise level.  People (even some servers) were singing very loudly to the country music playing over the speakers.  The birthday we witnessed was obnoxious.  We could hardly hear to have a conversation at our table.  However, the food was so good that we were occupied stuffing our faces anyway--so I can forgive the noise.  Maybe I'll order take-out next time....since there WILL be a next time."}
{"text":"Best place in town From eating ribs and the yummy fresh bread and the country music blaring.   I went there for my 30th birthday.    Amber"}
{"text":"We eat here frequently and normally have a good experience. Food is always good but the service was not up to the normal standards last night. Tyler your tip was bad because you did a horrible job. I always tip 20% min. Your lose pal."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  Our son had given us a gift card so we went on a Sunday evening. There were people all over waiting for a table but we really didn't have to wait very long. The fast friendly service and large portion sizes surprised us. My prime rib was not cooked the way I ordered it and they couldn't have been nicer about redoing it. We took home tons of leftovers - enough for an entire 2nd meal the next night. The prices were lower than you might expect for large portions of very good food."}
{"text":"Awesome service, Awesome food. Will definitely go back again. Our waitress was very attentive and courteous. She kept our iced teas full and even brought me extra ice, upon finding out I'm a lot of ice girl. ;) Our steaks were cooked perfectly, just as we had ordered. Very enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to eat, and I love the staff. The waiters and waitress are always helpful. I took our 5 month old there and she loved it. Never cried and even when they did their birthday song and dance."}
{"text":"Gota love the road house food is always good and reasonable in price service is good I guess any location is just about the same so its good all the way around"}
{"text":"Usually a wait but consistent food and of course you get to yahoo for at least one birthday every time you're there. Beware of peanuts. Tgey are additiv additives and fill you up. Wish they offered regular butter, the sweet stuff is over the top."}
{"text":"I don't want to tank this place because the host couldn't seat people properly.  We actually never got seated because waited so long.  All I can judge this place on was the employees and they were talking crap about the customers, so I'm sure I wont come back to this location anytime soon unless they actually accept a reservation."}
{"text":"Good food steak was a little dry but everything else was great"}
{"text":"I ordered my steak medium rare, it lacked flavor and was overcooked. The service was good though. So if you're a fan of good service and sub par food give it a shot."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant many times, and the food is always good and the service is good. In addition the prices are very reasonable. They are usually very busy on weekends, but other times are not too bad."}
{"text":"Awesome food. The steaks are fresh and the atmostphere is fun and laid back. Peanut shells are everywhere and every now and then the waiters dance. The bread and the butter is easy to fill up on, so be careful, it's awesome. And they also have Shiner Bock, a great Texas beer that goes good with any burnt meat."}
{"text":"The service at this place is horrible! The waitress we had was either brand new or is in need of additional training. We came with a very large group, about 35 people. We all let her know ahead of time that we were going to be splitting the check several ways and offered to order separately to assist her and her coworkers once the bill was due; unfortunately, she did not take our advice and insisted on taking all orders together. You guessed it, all the food orders were delivered to the wrong tables and the checks..... that was embarrassing. Unfortunately the waitresses and managers (yes plural); evidently they have several managers because I kept getting passed around when I was searching for resolution.  The managers were not at all open to feedback or constructive criticism. Needless to say we will NEVER be coming back. It's too bad, the food was not that bad; it's the service and incompetence that will keep us a way.  Not to mention, it took over an hour to have our food delivered to the table. Pathetic."}
{"text":"I'm a regular. They're always busy, but the service and food is spectacular!  what's not to love about Tex Roadhouse!"}
{"text":"I pretty much live here, I always order the half slab, and it comes with two sides, I always get the Cesar salad and mashed potatoes LOADED, which means sour cream, cheese and BACON , the ribs are just always amazing, I can't get enough of them, whoever I'm with always enjoys it, of course they can never go wrong with the fresh bread they have, it's so good, I can't get enough of it, I've gotten so many different servers, every each of them have been nothing but amazing, everyone is always so nice and friendly! I can't not wait to come here again like I have been for over a year now!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here and it won't be our last! The food was good, the service was good except they forgot to bring us our cactus blossom, ( was kind of looking forward to trying that)  other then that  the place was great!"}
{"text":"Took my son in law there at his request for his birthday dinner. Food was ok, never as good as Logan's across the street. Server was very attentive until the very end. From the time she picked up the bill and credit card to the time she was going to run the card she lost it. They had every employee in the place looking for it with no success. The manager came to the table to apologize and took care of our bill however did tell we would be surprised at how often it happens. Really? There is no excuse for it happening even once. Very inconvenient had to go home cancel my card and then deal with moving all my bills to a new card. Been eating out for decades and never had something like this happen. They did call 2 days later to tell my wife they found it but obviously to late."}
{"text":"We were on vacation at the Great Wolf Lodge and decided on this restaurant since we get such great food and service in our hometown. Well, we were wrong! The first booth the placed us in hadn't even been wiped down. There were glass marks and peanut shells on the table. I complained and we were moved to a \"clean\" table. This table wasn't wiped down either but it wasn't as dirty as the first table. However, the booth side I sat on wasn't secured to the ground because EVERY TIME we moved or the person behind us moved, it was like a see saw! The food took a while to get to us and they weren't that busy. The only good thing about that place was our server Dustin. He was very  attentive and professional. Based on him alone, I would have given this place 5 stars. Next year, we'll skip this place and head to Bojangles!"}
{"text":"I don't review often but I feel compelled to review in this case.  We visited the Surprise Texas Roadhouse on Saturday, 8/13/16.  When we arrived @ 5pm there were no peanuts in the waiting area - something we have learned to expect from all the Roadhouses.  We were seated in a timely manner only to find a small bucket of very stale peanuts covered with empty shells waiting on our table.  Our server didn't bring out the bread till the salad arrived then made a hasty retreat.  I had to flag her down to bring the little bread plates.  My husband ordered a medium filet with shrimp.  I ordered the salmon.  My salmon was over cooked and dry.  My husband's filet was very well done and the shrimp were of the chemical, rubbery kind.  The souse wine was terrible and was our entire experience.    Poor management is obvious here."}
{"text":"Generous portions, superb caesar salad, relaxing atmosphere, good steaks, and free peanuts! Seriously, what's not to like about this place?  My favorite steak are the T-bone and the prime ribeye, medium well, served with baked yam as the side.   Of course, don't go here if you are allergic to peanuts. it's definitely NOT a free-peanut zone, people throw peanut skins everywhere. And also, it's always a good idea to call ahead. They don't take reservations, but they will usually accomodate you if you say you're on your way and let you know if there is any table open within a certain period of time."}
{"text":"Steaks aren't bad and the service is prompt. Overall just another run of the mill steak joint."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service .For a great steak you sure can't beat the road house.  And the service is also great every time I come here ."}
{"text":"Love the rolls,  they just need to offer a gallon o' cinnamon butta. Oh yea, the ribs and loaded sweet potatoe is Awesome too."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent. Great service. The only thing I don't like it the wait time. It's a very popular place so expect to wait during busy times.  Definitely blows away the competition (outback and longhorn)"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE place for steak! I am the fan of the fresh baking bread there. I love the Ft worth ribeye which is not expensive and delicious. I really recommended the marshmallow with your potato or sweet potato. It is worth that price.  I have one reason that i give 4 out of 5. It is my steak kind of overcooked. Overall, i recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Don't want to wait during the rush then you can do the call ahead seating which is great.  Have tried almost everything on the menu and so far everything has been perfect and if you aren't in the mood for beef or pork try the salmon and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Amazing service! A long wait to get seated, but it was very busy. Highly recommend the ribs and the Jamaican Cowboy!!! So delicious!!! Such a well run operation! Fast, friendly, smooth service!"}
{"text":"I like peanuts, I like steak, my daughter like ballon animal"}
{"text":"We love this TX Roadhouse!! We love the food and the service and Brooke the hostess!! She is so welcoming and friendly!! We go here all the time and my favorite is the shrimp dinner and instead of rice I get green beans and a side of chili and the dinner salad with a side of bacon bits!! My family also loves the beef tips with mashed potatoes and the ribs!! We also love the way they bring over the saddle to sit on while they do their birthday chant and my daughter loves when they do their country line dances:)"}
{"text":"The absolutely worst customer service ever!! We were told on the phone that it will be a 20 minute wait. An hour and a half later they had the balls to tell us that they were cleaning off your table. 15 minutes after that it still was not ready. DO NOT GO to this location!!"}
{"text":"Highly marginal food. Typical macro chain restaurant fare together with the sales pitch on gift cards"}
{"text":"We call this place a Texas Road Kill. The staff there needs to be trained on how to seat people. You are better of going in small group, say party of two or three. We have had such bad luck with the wait time too long even with the reservation. Since then,we made up our mind that we would rather lick our own toes than go back there. It's not with it."}
{"text":"I usually am of the volition that chain restaurants are the undoing of society and represent all that is wrong with dining establishments and food service in general.  But as some actor in a commercial with a bicycle riding squirrel once said \"I don't hate this\"  Sure it was disgusting in terms of cleanliness, sure the food comes from a Sysco like supplier, sure the people there aren't paid enough to care, but you know what, the food was somewhat tasty and a complete shock to frequent visitors of casual dining establishments, their seasonings actually stood out (sometimes in a bad way, but hey at least they splurge and care about the food to say cost control be dammed).  Chili was good.  Too much paprika and probably had some unnecessary liquid smoke in there but it was really tasty and perfectly spicy.  The burger was actually medium rare, almost as much a flooring to me as the fact the waiter asked how I wanted it cooked.  It was tasty and juicy a true departure from most casual burgers and even might be a better taste than DMK in Chicago (and if you think that is sacrilege then get a burger from any TXRH bring it to DMK and compare yourself).  The steak here sucked, typical casual dining.  All in all I would RETURN, which is a real amazement as I avoid casual dining like the plague.  Overall 70/100 and no im not going to make the effort to break it down into subgrades because there is still no one who works at casual dining that cares or is paid enough to feign emotion."}
{"text":"Husband took me there for our Anniversary dinner and the steak were very delicious. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The service and hospitality was the worst we have experienced. When our group of four arrived at 7:30pm tonight the hostess seating us took us to be seated and then said she made a mistake and we would have to follow her back to the front desk. Once back to the front another group of four just walked in and was promptly seated by another hostess as we waited for our hostess to seat us she then informed us we would have to wait as no other tables were available. I asked our hostess why the group of four who came in after us why they were able to get seated and we were not. She snipped that's just the way thing's go sometimes! Just then a table did open up and we were seated at a dirty table. They cleaned it off and asked what we would like to drink. We all ordered water and our waitress said she would be with us in a minute. After ten minutes our waitress came back to take our order. We proceeded to order the prime rib and she informed our group they were out of prime rib. I asked our waitress why she didn't inform us the prime rib was not available prior to the wait on her return to take our order and she quickly responded in a very loud and rude voice\" I don't know what your going to order\" I quickly responded that it would be nice to know what is available prior to looking over the menu and making a decision on what is on the menu and then to be rudely informed what's on the menu is not available! We promptly left and headed to the Texas Roadhouse on Gilbert and Germaine. The staff was very courtious the manager was very visibly present and the hostess seated us and informed us they were currently out of chilli but would have more in ten minutes. When our waitress came to ask what we wanted to drink she to informed us of the chilli as well as the remaining prime rib. We will not be patronizing the Texas Roadhouse on Power and Ray!!!"}
{"text":"Just had late lunch/early dinner with a friend. As always had great service and food.  The Rib-eye is delicious, and the ribs are really good. I travel a lot and this is a great Steakhouse. The price is excellent.   Very good choice of side dishes and the dinner rolls with the butter is excellent."}
{"text":"This was the second time coming to this restaurant had a steak dinner steak was not good send it back came back same thing manager came over it says it's their fault from the kitchen she said then dinner is on us then we get the check and guess what she didn't - it so I had asked the waitress to take care of it"}
{"text":"Food for 8 people arrived in 2 shifts - 25 minutes a part. Manager was supposed to talk with us - never appeared. Had reservations - had to wait an extra 30 minutes Food was ok Staff was nice"}
{"text":"My family always has dinner here very friendly staff, the manager not sure her name but she is a female and is always going around asking her guest's... how is everything! We are glad this location opened up now no more long drives to Peoria, AZ. Food is always hot and delicious bread is amazing. My favorite is the ribeye steak and pork rib combo with a salad.   I work at a hotel very close by and I recommend this restaurant to guest's staying at our hotel all the time. I work the front desk and always have guests pleased after they have dinner here!"}
{"text":"Awful. The tables are sticky. I ordered a cheeseburger, extra well done it was served pink inside. My mom ordered ribeye with sweet potato.  Rib excessively fatty and, the best....hair in her sweet potato.  We walked out. Totally unacceptable. This place is gross. Never again."}
{"text":"Crappy BBQ Joint! Used to be one of my favorite places and still is; just not this one. Their chef is horrible. All their meat is dry and disgusting! I live 2 mins away and won't ever come back."}
{"text":"The steaks were excellent but overshadowed by the incredible lousy inattentive server who basically took the order and dropped off the bill. Most of the wait staff hung out by the entryway chatting among themselves. Poor management. Never going back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love eating here!! The wait for a table can sometimes be a little long but it's worth it! My family and I are frequent customers, last time we came in to eat, my father ordered a steak cooked medium rare. He received his steak and it was not cooked enough for his taste, the server was very polite and sent it back. They cooked my father a brand new steak but it was still too undercooked for him. The third time they sent the steak back, it came out perfect. I believe the cook or the manager( I could not tell because he did not have a name tag on) personally dropped off the steak and apologized for the inconvenience, he suggested that next time my father should ask for medium well and they even took care of the check for him! I was very happy with the service and it was a great time, like always."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place on the way home to LA. Just saw the sign decided to give it a try. Was very pleasantly surprised at how very good the food was. Service was excellent. Would've liked to try the beer but was driving. Had a 10 oz ribeye which was done perfectly. Sweet potato was great. Rolls were delicious. Other person's chicken sandwich (road kill? Not sure of the name) Was excellent. Moist and flavorful. Another's pulled pork sandwich was one of the best. The restaurant is great value. Will try to hit others if I see them. Could do without the country music but heck, if you go to a restaurant called Texas Roadhouse you'd better be expecting the slightly kitschy decor and country themes. We wanted to take our remaining roll with us on the road and asked for a box. They gave us a box and a whole set of new rolls! Highly recommend this. If I'm in the area, definitely will go back. Hope they bring one to LA with the same quality."}
{"text":"7 star ribs...yummy yummy...really wanna eat it now.but closed, tomorrow! a bit far from me, when is it gonna open in robinson area? expecting..."}
{"text":"Chicken taste bland and not roasted correctly.  Rib sauce was spicy n not listed as spicy.  The shrimp was over cooked and bread was gross under the shrimp.  My 8yr old nephew didn't even eat his burger because it was dry.  Service was great but not the food."}
{"text":"Having been to a Texas Roadhouse only once prior, and not having a great opinion of that particular one in Illinois, we found the Goodyear location to be a very pleasing restaurant.  We called in a reservation prior to going as we had seen very long lines at this location in the past.  They gave us a number that we provided upon our arrival and we were seated within ten minutes.   Though the restaurant was very crowded the service was exceptional and our waiter provided excellent service even though he was being run wild with all the large parties he was taking care of.   The food was another pleasant surprise.  The steaks were cooked as ordered and quite tasty.  The sides were well prepared and good portion size.  My wife ordered a loaded baked sweet potato and it came with melted marshmallows on top, tasted wonderful, just like her mother used to make.  Overall we really liked this restaurant and do plan to return."}
{"text":"This place screws up my meal for the 3rd time now. Last time here. Nice help, just not sharp"}
{"text":"Service is great. Food is good. Had prime Rib cooked really good. The only issue was alot of salt is used on fries. I will be back just lighten up on salt."}
{"text":"Service was satisfactory. While steak was good, it certainly was not cooked to an internal temperature of 160°F as requested. Pork chop was inedible, way too salty, was removed from bill without requesting. Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes. Seriously yes. I would definitely recommend you try this place out. Only. Before you leave your house, call them and get a spot in line. I have called in 3 times now (on weekends) and each time I wait less than 30 seconds before I am seated (it is a 15 minute drive to get there however).  When you are walking to your table (not a waiter but the hostess) will grab hot rolls for your party. Having something to munch on before someone even takes your drink orders? This place has got me interested. They even have got peanuts waiting for you if you don't want a roll. Food? Fantastic. I have tried several dishes there just to explore the menu. Only one I didn't really enjoy was the Chicken Tenders. Other than that, I got no complaints.   Never been to Texas Roadhouse? Go on a Friday night (call ahead). Then mention it to your server that you have never been. I snagged some free appetizer coupons from the manager. You can bet that got my wife hooked. We love heading over to Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is is about the same @ wherever location you eat at. Very noisy , good service,adequate food.  I had the oven baked half chicken.  The breast was dry  (typical ), dark meat was moist. Would go back. Good place for a meal."}
{"text":"Good Service OK food Mashed Potatoes and Veggies were good , Ribs dry and and overcooked."}
{"text":"This place needs to learn how to cook steaks.  I have been at Texas Roadhouse 3 times and twice the steak was so salty and wet I was unable to eat it.  Th 3rd time, I order a hamburger WITHOUT seasoning and it was again so salty I had to send it back.  Terrible food , , , stupid country music , , , terrible service,  Unable to see why people go there!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love their steaks and rolls with the cinnamon butter, the wait staff has always been friendly.  Over all a good experience every time!!"}
{"text":"I don't know how folks are upset about the value. A full rack of ribs here is $3 off of actual cost. That $3 gets you hours of being (usually) cooked until falling off the bone (and no dishes or scraping grills after), and two sides... we get the huge caesar and the sweet potato. I'd say in the end you pay less to get it here than to make it yourself.  The ribs are amazing (if they are dry, send em back if you have to. Trust me, I am a rib person, and 9/10 times they are perfect. If they arent, bitch. You should never have to use a knife on these), the steaks are very good, sides are good enough... atmosphere is fun and well-rounded. I come here for lunch, dinner, drinks, and on family night... always comfortable.  BBQ glory is in the eye of the beholder. Their sauce is spot on to my tastes- sweet, savory, smoky... pile it on, boys.  And yes, I WILL take a crate of rolls to go, thanks."}
{"text":"This place will fatten you up! Staff was great, food was even better. We ordered the ribeyes 10 ounce medium. They came out perfect. The yeast rolls and honey butter will mess up even the best of diets."}
{"text":"Good food but service is the issue. Wrong or missing orders and hard to get a waitress to fix if you have a problem. Super loud as well.  Not what you normally get at this chain."}
{"text":"Found this place by chance while visiting from out of state.  Glad I came in early 5:30 p.m. because after that it really got busy.  The wait staff was friendly, advised them my 1st time here they took their time & explained the menu in detail. I had the Rib Eye & Ribs combo...portions were generous, steak cooked to perfection, food was delicious.  Next time I'm in town, will definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"My favorite place. Good food, affordable prices and nice staff."}
{"text":"The Cirloin was so good, I didn't need any A1!  The Caesar salad was so good, I almost forgot about the steak! The bread and honey butter were so good, I almost forgot about the salad!  Best meal I have ever had, ever!  My compliments to the Chef."}
{"text":"This is, hands-down, my favorite steakhouse and one of my favorite restaurants overall. I am usually not a big meat eater, but this place prepares chicken and steak like no other, making you fall in love with every dish. The buttered rolls are to die for and the atmosphere is always fun and lively. They have excellent service with waiters that are always attentive and helpful. This location also seems to be more homey and friendly then the Naperville location. Be sure to do call ahead seating, especially on the weekend, or you will be waiting for hours. That being said, if you do not like country music or a southern atmosphere, then do not come here. Expect everything that comes along with a restaurant named \"Texas\" Roadhouse."}
{"text":"We like the TR on 75th, but this one didn't make a good meal. Maybe they hadn't really gotten set up well yet. Mac and cheese was from a box, unlike at the other location. Steak just didn't taste good.  Too bad,  as this location is much closer."}
{"text":"Third time here, exceptional experience. Hubby wanted to go here for Father's Day - are you kidding? Both times before, the place was PACKED, with people overflowing outside, so we knew today especially it would be filled to the brim with people. It was, but we called ahead and only waited 15 minutes. We were seated and given our freshly prepared rolls and honey butter - YUM. Reba was our waitress. Out of the 5 of us, 1 had never been there before, so Reba explained quickly and very efficiently the entire menu and how things are prepared. We ordered our drinks which she delivered quickly, and took our order. They were SO busy, and service never lagged. Our salads came out quickly, and our entrees were perfectly timed, giving us all time to chomp down some warm rolls and eat our salads. Here's what we ordered:  8 oz. Dallas Filet, med-rare. OMG. That was the BEST filet any of us has ever tasted. No kidding. I put that up against a Ruth's Chris or a Fleming's filet any day. And yes, I have had a filet at both of those places. It made our eyes roll back it was so good.  2 of us ordered the 10 oz. Prime Rib, both med-rare. WOW. Again, some of the best prime rib we've EVER had. It was so lean and tender, with a perfect size edge of fat around the top side of it. Hubby and I have been to a handful of upscale restaurants here in the Valley who supposedly specialize in Prime Rib, and we have been extremely disappointed. Those of you out there who really like prime rib know what I'm talking about. Most places around the Valley serve this big slab of meat that has a lot of fat in it. You're left with a piece the size of a child's palm by the time you cut out the icky stuff. Or you get it, and you have to chew and chew on it. But not at TX Roadhouse! We couldn't have been more pleased with their Prime Rib.  Fillet Medallions, medium, shared by 2 people who added a couple side salads. They said it was very good, too.   We had loaded baked potatoes, fresh veggies, applesauce, and salads for our sides. All good. Potatoes were a little dry.   We were checked on by at least 3 different people, and were even given a coupon for a free appetizer for our next visit. That's what pushed my rating to a 5. Keep up the good work, TX Roadhouse! You will see us again!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! My husband and I love the fresh food and steaks are always awesome!! Asked for a hand cut steak and the waitress told us the meat cutter would hand cut it for us! Well, he did and we want to send a huge shout out to Josh, the awesome meat cutter!! Steaks were cooked perfectly, waitress was awesome as always!!"}
{"text":"I have loved this place for years but my last visit 3 days ago may seal the deal from ever going again. Service was ok until we got out salads. Both salads had small flies or gnats on the lettuce. Maybe they got on while we were eating who knows but I quit eating after a few. It's and the sever didn't seem to care.  Then my 11 oz medium rare sirloin came out...barely any pink and chewy...server states \"looks good to me\". Wow. No thanks. I'll try other places next time"}
{"text":"First let me start off by saying I tried calling in my order when I was five minutes away. Basically i was still on hold when I walked in. There was two hostess at the front which neither one acknowledged me. When I heard one of them say somebody wants to place an order on line one which was me. Still No acknowledgment so I said excuse me I would like to place an order. Hostess number one started talking in her walkie and Hostess number two walked off then someone came around the corner and ask if they help me. She was the sweetest young girl, I didn't get her name but she was really sweet I placed my order at 7 o'clock and it is now 7:15 and all I had was a side of chili. Still waiting. It's now 7:23pm. The chili was good though."}
{"text":"I love this place. I use to work for them as well and i cant get tired of this food. Its great service and great steaks. Defently pedro, ramon, and venito best when it comes to cooking. Hands down drew great manager as well as lawrence. I love the bar."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite chain restaurant. I love this place. Wonderful service. I have been here at least 15 times, only once did my steak not get cooked right and they fixed immediately and discounted my meal. Their manager is awesome. I see her every time I go. She goes around to tables and is very personable. I even saw her working on crutches which shows some dedication. Go when they open or before 6pm and order off their early dinner menus which are so cheap!  Their margaritas are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Awful.  The food is at best mediocre however,  today we went in because Mom likes it and they tried to seat us at a high top with Granny who can barely walk, a toddler and two 9yos,  so we  asked to be seated near a bathroom for medical reasons and they put us in a booth that might as well have been in Tucson for its proximity to the bathroom.  They then said we could move for the third time,  by then it was a waste of time.  I ate nothing and half the leftovers that the rest of our party had are going to the dog.  Absolutely disgraceful service.  Longhorn, all is forgiven"}
{"text":"Food is always always spot on!  But the music was so loud, couldn't carry on a conversation with my husband across the table!!! Waitress said they always forget to turn it down after they do their periodic line dance."}
{"text":"I eat here often.  I order the ribs, BBQ chicken, and salads. I like the bread too! I have not had bad service here but I also have not had great service. I will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"Food was good as allways. Steak was jucy and chicken was cooked to perfection. Waitress attention was great."}
{"text":"This place has become a favorite spot for my boyfriend and myself. They bring piping hot fresh bread rolls to the table with cinnamon butter, and have buckets of whole peanuts at the tables to snack on while you wait too. The drinks are the best deal, you get large portioned alcoholic beverages for under 6 dollars, a pretty great deal and they are delicious."}
{"text":"Steaks are always good and tonight's ranked in my husband's top 10 best. Very busy but we \"called ahead\" to Texas Road house Call Ahead Seating and got seated way ahead of most people waiting. The best part of tonight's meal was the outstanding service by Hannah W. She was everything you want in a server -- professional, friendly and efficient. She took our meal order as soon as she greeted us because we knew exactly what we wanted, even before we got to the restaurant. The place was packed, every table and seat in the place was full but Hannah W. checked on us regularly and made sure we had all that we needed, always with a smile. We always get good service here but tonight was Way Above Average. Kudos to Hannah W, thanks for making our dinner such an enjoyable time."}
{"text":"We went to an early dinner at around 4PM on a Thursday, and it wasn't very busy at all. We walked right in and there was no wait. I really liked the atmosphere. It's a fun place! Especially how the staff does a little dance. It is a loud restaurant though. So, me and my boyfriend couldn't really hear each other talk.   Food was great though! My boyfriend's steak was cooked exactly how he wanted it. He absolutely loved his side of green beans and corn. The Caesar salad was one of the best I've ever had. I got an appetizer for my meal which was the boneless hot wings. They were so tasty, and just spicy enough. They came with blue cheese dressing and celery sticks.   The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 was because the waitress never asked if we wanted dessert. She just gave us the check and left. So we had to call over another waitress and tell her we wanted dessert. It's alright though because the strawberry cheesecake was excellent!  I loved the Caesar salad and cheesecake so much that I would probably come back just for that!"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect.  Steak was flawless, dinner rolls melted in my mouth and staff was very friendly. The steak was so good it didn't even need sauce.  Definitely go here again.  There was a 45 minute wait, but that's a sign of a good restraint (It was also the day before mother's day).   Hope this was helpful."}
{"text":"Seriously, I get the 8 ounce Top Sirloin steak here and have NEVER had a bad steak. There were $10 for years for the whole meal and just recently have crept up a bit price wise. Nobody in town can match that value and quality. Incredibly consistent every time. Love having the peanuts available, plenty of TVs here if I want to watch the D-Backs, Cardinals, or the Coyotes. Let's not talk about the Suns though recently. Also have had the Rib-Eye here which is also great, flavorful, and consistent. I guess they hand cut the steaks here and the gritle and fat are always trimmed off.   Good salads with good dressings, huge potatoes done nicely, flavorful rice if you are in the mood for that (and I frequently am).   Can get very noisy there, but I guess it's part of the western cowboy atmosphere. The employees line dance, and yell at the top of their lungs for customers birthdays. Servers here are ALWAYS pleasant, efficient, and into their jobs. Tips and management must be great. Very high recommendation for TR. It isn't a prime steakhouse if that's what you're looking for, but the steaks are very close to prime quality and the prices much better..."}
{"text":"I think the food here is great!  Great steaks!  You don't need to go to Morton's to get a good steak.  Salads are good and fresh.  Love the yeast rolls.  They generally have beer/drink specials, too.  It can be very busy on the weekend, but they do have call ahead seating so take advantage of it.  Get the kabobs - they are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Good service, good food. Seems simple but I feel like that's not so easy to find these days"}
{"text":"Steak was cooked good but even though it was a 19oz portion I would nock off a couple of oz for the huge bone in the meat. Also wife asked for a salad and veggies but got dry veggies and lettuce in a bowl. Not vegan friendly. I know its a steak house but dry veggies and a bowl of lettuce, don't try so hard now. Also the waitress likes to sit down next to you while she takes your order. A big no no on restaurant nightmares. This place has nothing on the big Texan in Amarillo TX. Just your run of the mill corporate creation."}
{"text":"Friday evening. Busy as hell. Water and salad were on the table fast. Samantha was our waitress and was the best bar none. The 16 oz steak melt in your mouth. The 5 cocktail drinks were on the weak side but that was probably a good thing. Again Samantha was awesome the entire time. 4 stars. Ask for Sami....with an i."}
{"text":"My review is a little lat I know it's been 5 days since I have been here but I finally have time to say how I felt about it. Me and some close friends decided to go to this location due to the fact it was close to their house I was just at the metro center location 2 weeks prior for my fathers birthday which was a 5 star experience.  I used the call ahead thing for seating and was told we would have a table when we arrived at 8 pm Well we arrived and no one knew about my call in which I had a code of P873 which was to be given when we arrived to get our table. But they gave us a buzz thing to let us know about the table readiness which we waited an additional 25 minutes for seating we got seated finally and they put a table together which was connected to a booth and left a one person walk way to the 2 tables behind us which was very inconvenient for us and the servers everyone got the hot bread before us after they sat down and we had to ask for our which we were told we had to wait because there was none at the moment and we got our appetizers late our server Darin was awesome for what the location provided him to assist with serving our party of 7. The food was amazing and cooked just right as usual I got the 16oz ribeye which was so tender and juicy and melted with every bite. My side was small potatoes in a bowl big enough for my 11 month old child but at the metro center location the just stabbed all the Potatoe goodness and flowing gravy on the plate but not this location. I called the manager the next day to complain about the seating thing because I felt it was unfair of them to advertise that when it's simply not true in my particular experience with the restaurant. I was told I would get a call back later in the day by the store manager and never was called back. I won't be back to this place but I will go to the metro center restaurant in the future because the food is always amazing."}
{"text":"amazing experience.  went here for my dad's birthday dinner and it was an overall 5 star experience.  I would give it 10 stars if they had the option. Our waitress Felicia was awesome. she was on top of our drinks and food and was very friendly and we went on a day that they wore super hero outfits and she was wonder woman which was appropriate given that it was busy and she still took very good care of us as a server. The food was also amazing I got the 16 oz rib eye and the steak was so good it seemed to melt in my mouth with every bite and at the end Felicia grabbed a saddle and had my 54 year old father sit on it and did the Texas roadhouse yeeeee haaaaaawwww song and dance. just an amazing experience and I will be back in the future. being there is a black angus and another steakhouse right next door to each other there is no comparison even the price was good. best steakhouse hands down. A must visit if you are ready to have fast friendly service and amazing food."}
{"text":"Good bread and seated quickly, but the cheese on the cheese fries was barely even melted. The main entrees weren't that great- most of my family felt so-so about their meals. As a vegetarian, I knew my options were limited at a steak house; however, we visit Longhorn regularly and I'm always satisfied with the sides I choose. We all agreed that this restaurant was a one and done."}
{"text":"one of the best steaks i've ever had. every bite melted in my mouth. flavorful, juicy, superior steak. my sides were good but average. we got some appetizers which were very good as well. if you are looking for a great steak, this is your place. cool atmosphere. good service. will definitely have to go back just for the steak."}
{"text":"Haven't had too many good experiences at this location. I've been going to Texas Roadhouse since I was a kid and it was always a good go to spot.  Tonight was awful. We got put in the kids area with lots screening toddlers that should have been left home. I got what I always get the 8 oz sirloin. It takes 65 minutes from sit down(not to count wait) until I finally got my steak and immediately got a box. When they first brought it out it was a shriveled well done 6 oz rather than the med rare I asked for. The sweet potato was hard meaning undercooked. After they took back the first attempt the manager brought the second one(after a loooong time) and with a smug look asked if something was wrong with the first one.  The waitress was trying but too much went wrong without apologies. Can't say I'll go here again, Longhorns have been popping up all over the valley and they do it right."}
{"text":"Place is hit andMiss. I ordered the chicken and steak combo and one of the steak medium well came out bloody. Otherwise everything was okay not my favorite Steakhouse if you want a premium Steakhouse go to Capital Grille"}
{"text":"Lately, the food has been hit or miss. Tonight we had some really bad service and the situation was not helped by the manager. I understand that everyone has a bad night, but the customer should not suffer! At least our food was good tonight."}
{"text":"Always have had great food and friendly service here. The bread is excellent and fresh. Service last time,when we sat at the bar,was a little slow and clueless,but she was very friendly and meant well.I'm not one to get upset easily over a couple of forgotton items.Had to ask for our waters twice because she forgot both times. But still,had a good time and great food. Prices are very reasonable too. I highly reccomend."}
{"text":"Great customer service, very friendly. Steaks are good for a value & without the need to dress up. Mix drinks are very good. Not much to complain about - used to be busy all the time with long lines but lately it seems they've figured out how to move people through quicker."}
{"text":"I have never (knock on wood) had a bad experience here. The food is great, the menu selection is awesome, prices are reasonable, plenty of sides to choose from and my wife, daughter and I always get a friendly waitress. They line dance upon request and Tuesdays are kids days where they can get a free animal balloon, free ice cream and 2 free toys. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A texas steakhouse chain with a roadhouse ambiance. Tends to be busy and is ALWAYS LOUD--not the place to go for a peaceful meal or if conversation is important (someone should tell them that a corrugated steel roof and wood everything else does not make for good noise control). Food is sound, with great rolls (cinnamon butter--yum yum), and your basic steak menu choices with a few non-beef items. Salads could be fresher. Steaks tend to be cooked as ordered. Servers are friendly but occasionally a bit scattered. Good place if you want something lively and quick, and a good alternative to TGIF's next door. Only open for lunch a few days--check before you go for lunch."}
{"text":"Can't think of a better steakhouse and value for your money. Steaks have a great flavor, you can taste the freshness. Love the free peanuts! Great atmosphere. Quick and friendly service"}
{"text":"We went here for mother's day.  They ran out if prime rib which I was quit sad, but we ordered steak.  They also had beef ribs on the menu which is very rare for restaurants to have, usually restaurants have pork ribs. I was extremely happy about that since I don't eat pork.  We ordered ribs and steak.  Our food came out over done,  but the manager was so amazing he got us new plates and made sure our food came out the way we wanted. The manager and server was absolutely amazing that I didn't even care about not having prime rib or our food came out bad the first time.  The establishment was packed with a lot of complaining customers that were looking for free meals. The staff handled it very professionally and always had a smile on their face.  Very impressed!"}
{"text":"My experience was sub par for a variety of factors.   First, the food. I ordered my usual 10 ounce ribeye medium rare with two salads as my sides minus croutons. The steak was horribly salty to the point that I couldn't finish it. The salad was fresh and crisp. I think they brine their steaks. Everyone else had similar opinions about their food.   Secondly, the manager Ron. He comes out to see how we are doing towards the end of our meal, we tell him we're doing fine. Out of nowhere he said a that my partners mother could not expect to have her food prepared her allergen free way had they been busier such as their 7 o'clock rush. We were all stunned. In Rockford Illinois the Texas Roadhouse dotes over my partners mother. They'll come out and make sure she's satisfied and know her by face and name.   Lastly, the response from Tom Higgins the Managing Partner for this location. He said that Ron shouldn't have said that Texas Roadhouse wouldn't be able to provide allergen free meals at certain hours and said he'd be happy to prepare her meals anytime, but he reiterated that Ron was inline with his remarks. I don't care for Tom's sorry-not-sorry statement.   One good point was our server Max. He was very attentive and read back out orders and came to tell us about allergens. He was awesome and even showed us a picture of his beagle-lab puppy. Thanks, Max.   Good servers, okay food, bad managers."}
{"text":"Had a really good meal here. Would have rated it great if my steak was a little rarer, but i swapped with someone at thd table and we voth were fine. They still sing and line dance ( but could smile more!!!!). Great times with the girls are always fun. Margaritas are a bonus."}
{"text":"Mistakenly ordered the chicken fried sirloin. I did this about a year ago and I actually had forgotten how wrong this dish is. This is a special Texas dish that should be so tender one can slice into it with a fork. It should be made with ground sirloin or double tenderized steak. The sirloin at Roadhouse was a thinly pounded out piece of leather with several veins of hard  grizzle running through it.. The fried outer layer was overcooked, over salted and smooth. It fell short of the layered, fried chicken crust this dish should have. They did get the creamed gravy right. The brown gravy is also  good, but salty.  Husband's sirloin was ordered medium well. What he got was charred on the outside, dark pink on the inside, throughout. He had to send it back, and we have never sent a dish back int he 15 years we've been together.  I did not complain about my meal because I realized this is just the way the dish is prepared there. But....I will never order it again. I don't even think we'll bother going back there.  If you do go, the rolls are still yummy and amazing. The beer is still cold and good. Don't bother ordering steak unless you are ordering filet, however, because their steak seems too leathery. It was pretty awful.  We were so disappointed the chicken fried sirloin is so terrible. It is NOT the delicious, tender, forkful of yum from your Texas childhood. It is the stuff of nightmares."}
{"text":"Food was consistent with past experience but wait staff was very rude. Tried to deny our kids coins, even though the back said 1 per adult, they tried to only honor 1 at the table. Seems like service has been getting worse and worse over the last several months."}
{"text":"We've been here many times, but I forget to review it.  Food is pretty good,  crowded but steady seating- wait is short. You can do call ahead seating up to an hour ahead.  When you are seated,  it is with warm rolls and honey butter.   We were here tonight for a birthday dinner,  party of 8, including 3 kids.  Waiter was great. He was attentive,  checked in enough but not so much.  His name was David- definitely one of the nicest we've ever had there. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent. The prices can't be beat. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. Food is great. We went for a birthday. They made it super fun."}
{"text":"ordered ribs and steak right when they opened.  ribs were old and crusty...steak overdone.  are they selling leftovers?   have tried this place so many times and entrees are usually poor.  salad is good."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here.  Service has always been great, just hate that the wait is always so long but I know that going in so it is what it is. Prices are good too"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to get me a nice steak but now when I go there it's not the same like it used to be they use cheaper quality meat the meat is dry like the Mojave desert and the place  needs to be remodeled and it smells"}
{"text":"First I have to say we LOVE Texas Roadhouse....just not this location.    Something's up in the kitchen here.  Our favorite thing, the bread rolls, were way over cooked...sad for us.  I ordered the BBQ chicken breast.  It was as thin as a wood ruler and tasted like it too, VERY dry.  My husband ordered 6oz sirloin medium well.  It came out so rare it made me ill to look at it.  We sent it back....it came back the same only this time  tasting like it was fried in a pan or something.  My daughter's hot dog was mushy (really don't know how you can ruin a hot dog), my steamed broccoli tasted like it was dropped in the sand - it really felt like I was crunching sand, and my potato was hard (under cooked).  We don't like mentioning things we usually excuse a small thing or two but this was too much.  We told the manager - in a nice way - that we were disappointed and surprised. We usually love Texas Roadhouse......so he said he would 'take care of us'. He came back with a bill for our drinks; pineapple juice, diet coke, and reg coke.  Really?? Was that necessary? After leaving all of the food we had ordered right there on our plates.  The waiter was nice though.  See ya TX Roadhouse on Gilbert Rd."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of steakhouses (high end - low end) across the U.S. and this is hands down one of the best steaks and experiences we have had. Kudos, Texas Roadhouse Matthews, NC! You've won me and my husband over!"}
{"text":"We went to Texas Roadhouse for lunch today and what a great decision!!  Brandi was our server and she was amazing!!  I talked my fiancee in to going there and before we had left he said it would be our new spot!!  Our little girl enjoyed the food as well and all the staff was very nice and seemed excited to enteract with our little!!  So glad to have you in our area!!  Looking forward to our next meal!!"}
{"text":"Can never get enough of there steaks! We enjoy this place greatly and recommend it to everyone! We will keep on coming back for there great atmosphere, food, and, service!"}
{"text":"Great steak! Well seasoned and really tender. Natasha was our server, took great care of us. Would recommend this place any time."}
{"text":"Would give negative stars if I could. My visit last night with a party of two was the first time I have ever been so irritated that I literally walked out of a restaurant.  First off made a reservation by calling the restaurant and getting a confirmation code, was told the wait would be 50 minutes and was asked if that was okay, I acknowledged and did not mind waiting since I knew it would be busy on a friday night.  Went to the restaurant and checked in at exactly 45minutes after booking the telephone reservation.  When the hostess checked us in she told us it would be another 20 minute wait, ridiculous I thought given we had a reservation... but since its friday night I let it go and decided to wait and just review the menu so we would know exactly what we wanted by the time we where seated.  About 10 minutes went by and we where seated (Cool, I thought, we did not wait 20 minutes..) our server was Tiana (not sure about the spelling)   I don't know if she knew this was her last night working there or had plans to quit but she took 20 minutes after we were seated before she came over and took our drink order, at this time we did not even know who our server was other then the name but once she came over I made the connection, she was chit-chatting with other guests at a table 2 tables down from us, not serving them food, or getting drinks, just having small talk when she saw other guests seated in her section....  FOR 20 MINUTES!   To make matters worse once we ordered our drinks, simple lemonade and water it took 15 minutes to receive them, once the drinks finally came we where ready to order, our waitress asked if we wanted bread, we kindly declined and stated that we where ready to order our food.   This is where it gets really bad... We ordered the food, 15 minutes went by then all of a sudden the other waitresses were seating other guests around us on tables which where empty (guests that arrived after us).. they were promptly seated and drinks taken immediately..... we were still waiting on our food.. 20 minutes after having ordered the place broke out into \"footloose\" music and all the servers were dancing in the aisles, including ours, in front of our table... no acknowledgement or news of our orders was given, not before the dancing began or after the song was over, when the song was over (approximately 5 min) *total 25/30 min at this point, from time of order* our waitress leaves immediately after the song.  Then another 15 minutes goes by and it has been nearly 30-45minutes since we placed our order and we see two tables of couples seated near us who clearly arrived after we did who received their food and began eating.  At this point we waited another 5 minutes, absolutely no word from our server about status and we got up and left, worse service I have ever had, EVER! I will never go back to this texas roadhouse ever again.  It is a shame this restaurant was built in November and already it is operated in such a poor fashion. My suggestion to anyone else, go to the red lobster or olive garden nearby, I have frequented both those establishments multiple times and never have any issues."}
{"text":"Best. Steak. Ever!! I live in Payson I come down here just to eat here! They are really excellent! I love how we can just throw our peanuts on the floor it's so fun!"}
{"text":"I gave the Texas roadhouse 3 stars the service was average,the food was OK. I tried the ribs tender and fall off the bone but under seasoned and dry.I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon ."}
{"text":"We went to Texas Roadhouse for dinner last night.  We'd gone two other times but the wait was so long that we decided to go somewhere else.  We got in right away last night but we also went at 4:45 (on a Friday evening).  The food was mostly good.  These are the entrees that we had: salmon, chicken fried chicken, and ribs -- all delicious.  I had a baked sweet potato, which was good but the green beans that were my other side dish, were just plain awful.  The rolls that come with the meal, along with the sweet butter, were delicious.  It would have been very easy to eat too many.   For the most part, I would recommend the food.  Our server was attentive and though we did have to wait a bit to be served, once we placed our order, the food was delivered to our table in a timely manner. Even though the place was full and there was clearly a wait, I never felt rushed.  This is a noisy place.  If you want to have a conversation with your dinner companions this might not be the place for you. Also, I thought that it was odd that we had to wait to be seated because the waitresses danced at the entrance. Yes, they completely stopped serving because they did a line dance.  This happened once again while we were there and the music, that was incredibly loud to begin with, was turned up even louder.  So yes, to the food; no to the sound level. Maybe we'll order take-out next time!"}
{"text":"Very good all around chain steak house. Better then some and as good as most. Service was very good at this location."}
{"text":"(3.6) Service was very good. It looked like our wait may be lengthy due to a number of people waiting, but only about 10 min. We had their baby-back BBQ ribs...supposedly one of their \"known for\" specialty items on their menu, have to say...I found the ribs to be quite mediocre..."}
{"text":"This place has the WORST customer service i have ever experienced. When i have called the to go order line, they either, never answer, disconnect you, get your order wrong, or can't find your order when you get there.  On father's day, they had way too many people inside the building for it to be safe for people. I guess making money is more important than safety or good service. This place needs to replace the management."}
{"text":"Steak, beer, peanuts and you dont have to clean up whats not to like? You will find all of the above at this joint. I was surpised that the food was decent and my steak was very good. The prices were ok and the happy hour beer specials were great. The best part was that I had two small children with me and they could make a mess with the peanuts and I didn't have to worry about it. If you have children you will fit in with the crowd before 7:30. If you don't, I would suggest you come in after 730 to avoid all the kids."}
{"text":"Wow! Hats off to the staff of this Texas Roadhouse! They really know what they're doing. Hubby & I arrived on Sat night about 6:30 & it was packed! Unusual in these tough economic times- a good sign! We were told -an ACCURATE- 30-40 min wait. Ok, no prob, so we found a seat & enjoyed the free peanuts. Once seated we had a GREAT server named Matt. I have a dairy intolerance & he was happy to go to the kitchen to find out about the rolls he had just placed before us. While they are brushed with butter & I was willing to eat all but the tops, he actually brought me my own basked of rolls that hadn't been brushed! That was real nice! We ordered our entrees and I was really disappointed that they were out of the 1/2 chicken, so I ordered something else....but then 5 min later Matt reappeared to tell me the 1/2 chickens just came out of the oven & he had snagged one for me! Wow! Perfect!  All the food - from the rolls to the entrees to the side dishes- were piping hot and delicious. My hubby, who is a hearty eater said his portion size was perfect. I had leftovers for the next day. Service was quick and attentive (glasses quickly refilled) and what a value! With a generous tip (over 20%) we still walked out under $30. Hubby & I have NEVER walked out of a restaurant with NOTHING bad to say! That says a lot! Great meal, great staff, great value! We'll be back, for sure! :)"}
{"text":"Don't ever go here in any holiday and expect to use any coupons that they send out for a free appetizer. They said no so I got a glass if water and the cheapest thing on the menu. I would have gotten much more but because of their attitude they don't deserve anything.  Shame on you Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"While the food was good and the service attentive, the bill brought some rather unexpected surprises. Let's just say our server was Queen of the Upsell, but never mentioned the additional charge that came with each add-on. I don't expect to get something for nothing, but when she asks if I want some blue cheese crumbles on my salad, I would appreciate the disclaimer of the additional cost. Cheese and bacon on your potato? Extra. Onions and mushrooms on your steak? Cough up an extra few bucks. Make your house Margarita \"hurricane style\"? Bonus charge. Ask a kid if she wants marshmallows and cinnamon on her applesauce? Please tell Mom and Dad It'll cost them.   Like I said, I don't expect something for nothing, but I would appreciate an honest approach in running up my tab in an attempt to inflate your tip. I left feeling a bit nicked and dimed to death.   Diner beware."}
{"text":"Here at the Texa Roadhouse, where seating at the bar is first come first served.  HAILEY TRIES TO TELL US ANOTHER PATRON HAD BEEN WAITING LONGER than i have. How does she know. Ive been waiting an hour.  She tries to make me give my seat up to another patron. She ignores us until Danika approaches us and offers to serve us. Hailey would have left us hanging. Danika is an angel. Getting our order in quickly and efficiently. She has served us before and has never disappointed us. Haily on the other hand was a total \"see you next Tuesday \"  Vanessa is also great.  It was just Haily who was a complete B#%$h.  FYI: the above was conceived and written by my lovely wife, Deena.  \"Hell hath no rath as a woman scorned\""}
{"text":"Texas Road House saved our family's Christmas dinner!!! Bad experience next door at Buca di Beppo after they messed up our reservations! Texas Road House more than made up for Buca's mess up! Allie provided outstanding service! The food, staff, management, and atmosphere at Texas Road House were great especially for accommodating our large group on no notice! Great job Road House you'll be receiving more of our future business! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"This was amazing! First time visit! My kids loved it! Shout out to Megan my waitress and Chris the manager!"}
{"text":"Ate there last night. Had a little bit of a wait as usual (seems to be one every night).  That's ok, because I enjoy eating the peanuts while we wait.  Didn't get our waitresses name but she was awesome.   I always get my rib eye well done and as usual this place did not let me down. My steak was tender and juicy as usual. One of the reasons why I love coming here."}
{"text":"Yahoo, no one beats the service, quality, and price.  I came across this eatery while visiting family in Arizona. And when a friend informed they opened one near my home in California, I thought she was pulling my leg. But I have been there many times, and the hospitality and food continue to make for a great meal with family and friends.  Thank you for opening closer to home, yippie-ki-yay."}
{"text":"Eat here occasionally, good food choices for everyone. Their Hot bread is the best! The prices are reasonable and even better when you get their earlier. And their steaks are tasty."}
{"text":"We went in to have dinner and drinks last night. We received decent service but the food was horrible. This is the second time in a row that we went into this restaurant and received horrible food. I would not recommend this restaurant to anybody that is looking for a quality steak or prime rib. I am very surprised with how bad the food was because we normally really enjoy Texas roadhouse. We will not be going back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Big disappointment the fattest prime rib I've ever seen. Came here for the PR. Sent it back and was told all if their PR was just as fatty. Manager and server really nice but that doesn't make up for inferior food"}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse has a great thing going for them: delicious steaks at a fabulous price.   This location offers consistently great service and the food is always delicious. And the price? You can't beat it. Go anywhere and try to get a steak dinner with a side, salad, and rolls for $10.   Love this place!"}
{"text":"First time in a texas roadhouse, and I am a fan!  First, there were roasted peanuts at the table, and I was having a roll of a time getting acquainted with peanuts while I waited. The warm bread provided was excellent, and the only reason why I didn't eat everything was because I wanted to leave room for the beef.  Ordered the bone in ribeye, prices were really affordable. I wouldn't say the quality is on par with the best steakhouses, but for the price, the typical result is usually crap. Not here, it was well charred, nicely done with enough salt and pepper to bring out the flavor. I had a great time with the ribeye, definitely worth it (and great for my pocket) when I feel like steak for dinner.  The shrimp add-on was a surprise. Lots of garlic made the shrimp really delectable. After I went through half the steak, I decided the shrimp tasted better =)   Great meal, and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite steakhouse! Food tastes great and so does the price. The waiter was awesome as were all the other friendly staff. I wish there was a Texas Road House at home in SoCal! I got the steak and grilled shrimp with sautéed mushrooms, garlic bread, green beans, and a baked potato all for $17! I tend to eat a lot and I wasn't able the finish everything which is probably also due to the delicious free appetizer bread that they provide. It is no doubt that I will return."}
{"text":"6oz sirloin med rare (perfectly cooked) loaded mash, great house salad, and an endless sprite. All for $13. What a perfect lunch. The bar tender (where I ate) was very very nice and on top of the service. I was amazingly pleased."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience at Texas RH until tonight. Celebrating a military event for my sister and had the worst experience with service and food. I was denied a kids size meal because I was too old. We were given three baskets of rock hard rolls. Server continued to bring the wrong drink on multiple occasions. Almost everyone had something cold on their plate. Maybe it was an off night? Maybe the staff was trying to close up early? We came to have a nice night and to spend good money. Definitely didn't receive our money's worth and won't be returning to this location. Probably any other location will take care of you better than this place. Young inexperienced staff needs better management and training."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this location, I never have any complaints. Good food & service. Even when it's busy, the wait is never 20 minutes. You can't find a better ribeye for this price cooked so perfectly."}
{"text":"We had dinner there for my husband's birthday last week.  This is at least the third time we have been there that I was unable to get a prime rib rare or med. rare.  How can a steak joint not have rare prime rib before 6pm on a Wed?  Waitress didn't have to check, she knew they were out.  I ordered chicken fried steak instead and it was so salty I couldn't even eat half of it.  They tout themselves as a steak place, but don't seem to know how to actually cook steaks. Service was slow, and if I have my way we won't be back."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for this location and the reoccuring issue of their ability to keep items in stock. We actually love food at Texas and dine in at least 3 times per month. The problem is this location is CONSTANTLY out of Prime Rib, which is the main reason we come here. We thought the first few times it was just a fluke, but it's an ongoing problem especially lately. We now drive all the way to the Metro location since they always have Prime Rib available and we've never once been told they were out no matter the day or time."}
{"text":"Was getting late on a Wednesday Jan 6th 2016 around 630pm, so my wife and I decided to head over to Texas Roadhouse.  Got there about 7pm, checked in, and received the buzzer.  30 to 40 min wait, I guess.  Around 7:30 I was starting to wonder if the hostess forgot about us, because we kept seeing couples come in, and in 15min were getting seated.  My Wife calmed me by saying...\"perhaps they did call ahead seating\".  Okay so another 10 min rolled on, and a few more couples getting seated that weren't there when we arrived, and tables and booths were looking pretty vacant!  Quick decision....should we leave or find out what was going on.  Took my buzzer up, and asked if perhaps my buzzer was malfunctioning.  Hostess that took my name looked at me like she had no idea who I was, looked at the buzzer, then to her screen, and without saying a word to me called over someone to seat us.  Got to the seat....no bread.   Waited 10 min for the waiter...who took our drink orders only to come back after another 5min to tell me my beer wasn't available.  No beer.    Ordered Fried pickles for appetizer.   Pickles were good till the bottom, then got very soggy. Bread finally arrived, then another order of bread.   Finally got to order our food....8:10pm.   I got the 1/2 Chicken and 6 OZ steak, with Chilly.  Wife ordered pulled pork dinner.         8:45pm got food.   Had to send back Chilly which was Cold.  Pulled pork dinner.... cold.  Break that came with pulled pork...soggy.    Steak... Luke warm, but by this time I was starving.  Packed up the chicken, and the pulled pork, tossed the bread and got out of there.  Lesson for us: Don't go on a Wednesday unless you have kids, and you want to experience the Chucky Cheese atmosphere.....cause it's kids night!. Lots of balloons, and party atmosphere, but still need to pay attention to service and food quality.  It will be a while before we go back....and it won't be on a Wednesday."}
{"text":"First time at the Tempe location Friday night. The floors in the kitchen door way was dirty with food and napkins on the floor. The ladies room was so dirty the young lady who was sent to clean it said \"this is a mess\". I called the manager on my cell to let him know that the kids shouldn't be playing in the peanut barrel due to its a health code violation and no one is saying anything to them. He told me \" they shouldn't and if it happens I will stop them. lol, smh  I told him, I'm looking at you looking at the kids, he said your in the restaurant?"}
{"text":"It is what it is, a chain. Go in with realistic expectations and you won't be disappointed . Go in expecting a top steakhouse and you'll find they are short on the delivery. The conversations and sales lines from the staff are hokey at best. \"Made from scratch sides\"? Really? Never the less it's a decent meal at a fair price."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite chain - I can't resist steak (who can, anyway?) For all other locations, you may expect a wait between 45 min to an hour, at least. But maybe I came in late (8:30pm, and it is Phoenix, people) that night, I did not have to wait at all. Or if you may, call in to check beforehand (should have kept it myself..) Food was alright, as usual - steak I said. Staff were faily friendly though, which cut off 1/2 star rating (the other 1/2 was lost to the actual quality of food - I mean, talking about Morton's..) Overall, it is a good place to go. Steak saves the world :)"}
{"text":"Me and a few of my girlfriends came in the other night for girls night out, I ordered the sirloin which was cooked perfectly (as usual)! This was my first time at this location and I am so glad you guys opened one up closer to my house. Texas Roadhouse is one of my favorite restaurants. Ashley W. was our server and she did a fantastic job, she greeted us with a smile and gave great service. I'll be back in soon!"}
{"text":"We had wonderful service. We went on a tuesday around 5. It wasnt busy at that time.Food was good. My husbands steak was cooked perfectly rare."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here we have wonderful service and delicious food! I love the steak and shrimp!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow is all I can use to describe the evening here.  We were sat immediately for a table of 3, even though the parking lot and restaurant were loaded.  My filet, PERFECT!  Everything about our first visit here has me putting this place in my favorites.  I can't wait for the return!"}
{"text":"Our family's favorite place! Prices are reasonable, food is excellent, and the atmosphere is just right, with the music, peanuts, etc... The staff is what really makes this place stand out though, they all seem to actually enjoy their jobs, and they even look like they're having fun.  Make sure you tip them well, they earn it."}
{"text":"Second time here. The second time I was disappointed. We had called ahead for seating at 4:30 for 5:00. We didn't get seated until 5:45 and they still didn't have a table for 7 people so we got jammed into a booth.   Two drink orders were given to the wrong people, two orders of the mashed potatoes came out ice cold, and three orders of the mixed vegetables were almost raw.   The most ridiculous thing was the bus boys. They cleated off a booth behind us and they did it so fast and furious that food was flying and it felt like an earthquake. It actually made our table shake.  I really am at a loss why this restaurant is so busy all the time. I will never go back there."}
{"text":"Only 15 mins wait. Food delicious! My only problem was the waitress took my fries before I was done without asking! She also gave us the wrong bill-we will return cuz we love the roadhouse!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times with my wife and have never been disappointed. Service with a smile and excellent food to go with it. Always order the sirloin steak cooked medium and it's always perfect. The atmosphere is always fun and casual, of which I thoroughly enjoy because I don't like to dress up for dinner unless I have to. For the money, there's not a better place for steak!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight with 3 friends. I've never been there before, nor have I ever heard of this place. First of all, our server, Jessica, was the best!!! I live in Scottsdale and go to a lot of restaurants in this area, and although service is generally very good, Jessica is the BOMB! We got there early (5:30) and had called ahead to be put on the list. We were seated immediately to be welcomed with a basket of fresh hot delicious rolls. I'm not sure if it was the rolls, or the butter, but the sweet cinnamon flavor was fantastic! Our table of 4 went through 3 baskets of these rolls of deliciousness. We went there at the recommendation of one of us 4 who lives in Texas, and loves this place, and arrived early to take advantage of the \"Early Bird\" specials. Good choices for only $8.99. Three of us had the specials, and one had a burger. The Burger was huge! Only half was eaten, the other half went home. Two of us had the 6oz sirloin steak ordered rare, and one had the BBQ chicken; all was excellent, considering the price. We are already planning our next trip to go back in early March. What was really nice is that the part owner came to our table and stopped to chat. Nice touch. Pro's... good food at a reasonable price, great service (Jessica), Lively atmosphere, and the owner's interaction with the customers. Cons... (possibly). Maybe too lively for some people. Back ground (lively) country music (Texas Roadhouse?). I love country, but some people do not. Atmosphere is very noisy, but not loud enough that you have to yell at your dining partners."}
{"text":"They dont do background checks there and management could care less about who they hire or fire. A waitress named sheilla linares works there and had murdered a 2 month old child and feld to phoenix. Management knows about this and swept it under the rug and instead fired the 4yr employee after she feared for her life. The restaurant has really gone down hill and it starts with who they hire. And the cleanliness of that place is so below average. The bar is filled with black mold, employees dont wash their hands as often as they should, and I constantly see sexual harassment happening."}
{"text":"This was my first time in this restaurant. My mother-in-law wanted to treat us as she'd eaten there many times. My wife's steak was cooked nicely though over salted in places my mother-in-law and I ordered ribs. The ribs were overcooked, dry and very salty. The manager expressed surprise because there's \"no salt in the recipe.\" He asked for one run to take for a \"taste test\" and took the ribs off the bill. Our appetite was sated by that point so we didn't want them replaced. Had he wanted our repeat business, I think he'd have done better to come the whole meal aside from our three margaritas. Oh well. There are other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Having a good time and the people were very friendly. Then the salads arrived. I had taken a few bites and then noticed a dead fly drenched in cesaer dressing! Disgusting... Needless to say we didn't have the main course. People were nice, but cleanliness is key when eating out."}
{"text":"This is generally the steakhouse we love to go to in W. Phoenix. Good service. Gave us rolls and cinnabutter, no silverware or plates, Paul was helpful and got it for us. Steaks were charred outside and cold inside, asked for medium. My wife's was well done and she ordered medium. We got the mushrooms on our steak they were burnt and had a metallic flavor to them. She couldn't get a sweet potato if her life depended on it. It finally came, after we finished, and then a second sweet potato came out and we already had one sitting there. All of the staff was helpful and courteous to us, but they just missed out on the details. Management has issues in the kitchen. Hopefully they will get them fixed before we drive 3 hours from the White Mountains to enjoy a steak."}
{"text":"Definitely a big fan of Texas Roadhouse.  The best is the warm rolls and their signature cinnamon butter spread.  Food comes in great portions.  I don't have  a Texas Roadhouse near me, but anytime I am near one, I always stop."}
{"text":"I love Texas Roadhouse! The food is so good and stuffing. If it is your birthday you get to sit on a saddle and you get free dessert. The only bad part is the wait  and it's about 10-30 minutes. You get peanuts and fresh baked bread while you wait for  your drinks and food to come."}
{"text":"We would love to go back but it is so loud and staff breaks out in dance, really."}
{"text":"My family & I went to the Roadhouse on Saturday evening around 8:00. There was a small wait of about 20 minutes, which was not bad considering it was located off of Bell Road. The host staff was friendly & pretty organized. When we got to our table we were greeted by our server, she was very friendly but a little bit \"absent minded\". She forgot any & everything we asked for. After getting our food, it took her forever to come back to the table, our glasses stayed empty & she forgot items that went with the meal. In the end the manager did stop by to Welcome us & give us a free appetizer coupon because we were first time guest. The Ribeye my husband had was excellent but my Sirloin tips over rice was absolutely horrible. I will go back but I dont want that server ever again. That made the experience worse then my bad meal! I highly recommend she go back through training!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food.  Gaby was an excellent waitress!  Will be there again soon!"}
{"text":"Used \"called ahead seating\", which is something they offer so you don't have to wait, but ended up waiting 20 minutes anyway for an \"okay\" steak. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"So far this is my favorite steakhouse in the North Hills.  I believe this place has just recently opened and was almost completely full, yet sat us in 3 minutes.  I had filet medallions and I'd give them 4.5 out of 5, and the sweet potato was done perfectly.  My wife's strip steak was flavorful as well, and the kids steak was also tasty.  Great place, nice people, great food."}
{"text":"Great food.  We loved the rolls!  I got the Country Fried Chicken (which was amazing) and my wife got a HUGE steak!  The food was so awesome!"}
{"text":"I like the food at Texas Roadhouse; however, I am not a huge fan of the fact that the servers stop everything they are doing to dance in the aisles.   I love their rolls w/ butter. Everything I have tried on the menu is good! It is pretty loud inside."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat.. Awesome food and great service. Just do the call in reservation thing first or else you may wait a while before being seated."}
{"text":"I am usually a big fan of Texas Roadhouse and go there plenty. This one is usually pretty on as well but tonite it wasnt and I just got on yelp and will go with my total service tonite. The server was Joshua and he really wasnt that good. He spoke quick and when I asked for some extra rolls, butter and sugar for my regular tea he brought me 30 and said is that enough?? I was like yeah I was only needing 2-3. The food was dry but the tater was good. My date enjoyed it but also said it wasnt their best. It was a decently busy night but not super busy as always. I hope it was just a hiccup and not the usual"}
{"text":"I would say this Texas Roadhouse isn't like the others. It was a slow sunday evening meal my girlfriend and I was having and the meal wasn't that great. Steak was under cooked the first time ( they did fix it) but her chicken salad was very soupy. Service wasn't as good either that what I expect and am used to. I wouldn't recommend this one at all"}
{"text":"It sucked tonight. Been here a couple of times with no problems but tonight.... A friend ordered his steak well done but had to send it back twice because it was still pink inside. I had finished eating by the time the 2nd steak came out so my friend did not wait for a 3rd steak. Half the wait staff was too busy flirting & talking to a woman sitting behind us to even care.  If you like Texas Roadhouse, stay away from the Metro Center location. People call it ghetto center for a reason."}
{"text":"Went to Texas roadhouse to celebrate my 21st birthday. The service was horrible.  She came back over and over are you ready to order. She asked repeatedly. I've ordered a Coke with light ice glass was full of ice. I attempted to order a Budweiser for my 21st birthday because my ID was flipped vertically they refuse the sale.I looked up Arizona's law on my phone which stated I have 30 days until merchants can refuse or have to refuse sell.I spoke to the manager Chris he was rude and dismissive.The chili we ordered was on spot. We then attempted to order the prime rib which they were unable to cook or they were out. So they charged us for drinks and chili. on our way we were."}
{"text":"What a great experience. My father in law suffers from brain damage and sometimes is a little overwhelming for wait staff. Serah handled him like a pro! She was friendly, upbeat and positive. She made the entire experience an utter joy. The food was great too, lol."}
{"text":"Been to this location 4-5 times, and always mediocre at best. Overpriced and small cocktails (at least mine). Great service tho!  Last trip, ordered 10oz Prime Rib, med rare w/ ribs. Peanuts, ok they're free (oh wow!) but staler than sh*t. Ribs, dry and pretty tasteless. Prime Rib - AWFUL!!!  The outside 1/4\" was burnt and hard, couldn't eat.  The body of the steak was a kind of rubbery rare.  Like they cook it sous-vide to serve it.  Definitely wasn't a slow cooked prime rib!  For sure not cooked to order. Ate less than half and gave up.  Brought left overs home thinking for a stir-fry, but i'll just toss it.  lol, best part was the corn & bread.  Used to be a semi-regular at the Mesa location a few years back. Don't know if the location or most likely the economy (& cutting corners) is at fault.... but I've had my fill unfortunately.   Definitely rather spend a few bucks more and go to Long Horn Steakhouse.  Absolutely mouth watering prime rib & steaks."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from the bar. The bar area had a nice crowd but wasn't overly packed. My food took about an hour to come up out. From what I gather the bartender that took the order couldn't leave the bar to go to the kitchen to put it together. Needless to say my food had set there for a while. I ordered the ribs and a sweet potato. The ribs were ok but not something I would order again. The sweet potato was good. I probably wouldn't return for take out."}
{"text":"Absolutely love it here!- was my first impression, after sitting down and having a FULL meal with rare steaks and nasty French fries, I knew I was wrong from the start. My server was pleasant and friendly, and somewhat helpful during the fiasco, but what really frightened me to the core was the use of \"roadhoe\" in the restaurant? A young waitress referred to a group of girls as this derogatory term. Needless to say, my family and I was taken back, way back. When we told our waitress, can't remember her name, about the food, she grabbed a manager and they both rudely failed to helps family and I. They offered us free appetizers, yet we were already on our food? Needless to say we won't be back, period. I'm giving it 2 stars because at least the waitress was nice."}
{"text":"We've been a number of times and service has always been great. Unfortunately the only thing we've tried are the ribs because they are fantastic. Great place!"}
{"text":"I live nearby this new location, I have never been to a Texas Roadhouse before so I figured we'd try it some time. When we went for dinner it was a Friday night, around 6 pm. This place was packed!!!! There was a 45 minute wait, but we didn't care because we have never eaten there before. After our buzzer went off we went inside. We were immediately seated. Our server took a little while to appear and take our drink orders, which I could understand since they were extremely busy. As some one else noted this place is LOUD! You can't hear conversations amongst your table. While waiting for my food I started to feel light headed and dizzy because of how loud and cramped this place is. After we placed our order it didn't take long for our food to arrive. The steak I ordered look and tasted delicious, as did everyone's food. But when I started to eat my baked potato, and had already taken a couple of bites I noticed there was something in it... After i pulled what it was out between my fingers I realized it was a friggin eyelash. EYELASH! EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! At this point I was already a little upset and disappointed about this restaurant. But now I was completely grossed out. Our server was at the table next to ours. She had been there chatting it up, clearly with people she knew. We called for her attention, 5 time! Finally she decided when it was convenient for her she broke away from her conversation, and approached our table. When we pointed out the eyelash to her she acted like it was nothing, and that people receiving eyelashes with their baked potatoes were a common thing. She asked if I wanted a different potato. DUH I WANT A NEW POTATO!!!!! No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it. My mother-in-law spoke for me since I was so grossed out that I didn't even respond. After that I finished the steak, but the new potato went to waste. As we were leaving, there was a burly looking biker guy who was extremely intoxicated, and rude to my mother-in-law, by saying obscene comments. The people who go to this place are seedy, and so is the service. The only positive thing I can say about that place is that it's cheap. But at that price who knows what you might find in your food. Never again will I eat here. I knew we should have gone to Black Angus..."}
{"text":"Went out craving a salad, came here instead. The people are super nice from the get go. I got the shrimp skewers which were sooo good and SO spicy! The other food is alright, I took a couple bites of ribs. They weren't great. This is just your run of the mill steak chain restaurant, not to shabby not so great."}
{"text":"Service was kind of lousy. Came here on a holiday and so it was a mad house. Our estimated wait time was completely off. We waited for 45 mins when they told us 20. Food was good."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong the food here is as good as any other chain steakhouse, but the music gave me a headache. There is no way that it should be even half as loud as it is. I am not old I go to concerts all the time but I don't like to scream to order my food or to hold a conversation with the people I am with."}
{"text":"Meh... forgetful chain food... would like to give extra half star for the free peanuts.. and free rolls..."}
{"text":"As always... Excellent food and customer service! Asia was awesome... Very friendly and personable. :) Definitely keep coming back! Never a disappointment :)"}
{"text":"Went last night for date night & it was perfect as usual ! I had an amazing strawberry margarita & Jessica our server was great too ! Thanks for the great steaks always !! We love this place & the great food & great staff !!"}
{"text":"The food is always good!!!! The service is excellent!!!!  My family and I have been VIPs since it opened!!! I highly recommend this place for dinner!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. One time I ordered the filet mignon , and the second time I had a ribeye , both medium rare. The filet was cooked perfectly, but the ribeye was well done. Since it was busy and the source was slow, it wasn't worth the time to send it back.  The sides were good, but without the steaks being cooked to order every time, the sides just aren't that important to me ."}
{"text":"Well this place was my moms favorite. So we decided to take her out for her birthday. The whole family together for dinner which never happens. So I try and call ahead and and give notice because there was going to be 12 adults and 5 children. I was told they do not do reserve seating that I needed to come in.. Ok fine. I drive 30 mins to get  there 1 hour early to assure we would be seated. I get there and I get 2 stuck up \"ladies\" telling me that our family sitting together will be impossible. Why?? Can't you throw some tables together, we will be spending good money? I was told that unless we agreed to be seated separately in different areas of the restaurant they won't even put our name in line. I tried explaining that this was my moms favorite place and it was her birthday. I was told that there was nothing they could do. Needless to say we went somewhere else. We went to Logan's which they were more than accommodating. Yes they had to work a little to be able to sit us together but they did. They made over $600 and we left the amazing waitress a $100 tip. Customer service should be everything to the Texas Roadhouse but unfortunately it's not."}
{"text":"Call ahead for seating, its a MUST or you will find yourself standing in line!  Our favorite place is the one in Peoria.  The TX Road House in Surprise is awful!  Have ordered Road Kill dinner before 6 pm and it comes with a 10 oz steak, onions cheese and mushrooms and a choice of two sides all for $8.99 cooked the way you want it.  Salads are always ice cold and potatoes are big!  Their meat is always fresh. When this meal was ordered in surprise, it was so greasy I felt sick to my stomach after a couple bites.  The pork chops are fantastic and so is the catfish meal.  Ribs fall off the bone. Prices are great and the service is good.  I gave it four stars because the place in Surprise, is not up to par!"}
{"text":"TX Road House in Surprise serves the worst food I've eaten.  Its greasy road kills is awful.   The salad was not cold and the romaine was old.  They would not honor the free ribs as an appetizer.  Argued with the customer and the waiter won!  Its surprising how this chain can vary with the quality of food they serve.  I live in Surprise and do not dine at this location.  TX Road House across from Harkins theater in Peoria offers the same menu but excellent food.  The ribs, road kill, catfish, & pork chops are all excellent choices.  Salads are all ice cold and delicious!  Do check them out.  Love the hot rolls but do ask for regular butter.  The bucket of  peanuts are such an nice touch while waiting for your meal!.  I suggest calling ahead for seating.  They do not take reservations but you will be seated faster if you call in advance!"}
{"text":"Great steaks for a great price. Salads are served on ice cold plates and you can add shredded cheddar and real bacon pieces. Ribs are always fall off the bone tender. Place is always crowded so use their call ahead seating."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of the Texas Roadhouse chain! I have been here to many time to count.  This is this place where you eat all the peanuts you want at the table and throw the shells on the ground!  The service is usually always great, but once in awhile something lacks but the management always seems to handle it. To start I love the rolls, so good. I usually end up getting the prime rib or the steak kabobs, which are always delicious. I love the kabobs because you get a skewer of grilled veggies as well.   Everything is homemade there in the store so is always fresh."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for my moms birthday. Party of 11 total reserved for 3:30pm. They would not seat us until everyone was there. We were running about 10 minutes late.  But they got us a spot way back in a corner booth with a table. Not a lot of room but we dealt with it. Our waitress who was amazing and very accommodating especially since she was 9 months pregnant and 1 day over due!   The hot rolls were phenonminal even though we didnt have all our silverware to butter the rolls. Eventually got what we needed.  Since we didnt have much room we were trying to get plates and the peanut buckets cleared off the table. Our pregnant waitress was doing her best to take care of that.....meanwhile there are 3 young busboys standing a few feet away BS'ing with each other while she is running her butt off which happened throughout the whole meal!!!  My husband made several comments but she just acted like this was the norm and carried on. Finally at the end my hubby spoke up ( loudly) and told them to come over and help clear the table!! They jumped right to it. That is poor managing in my opinion.  It was funny because the manager told us to take it easy on our waitress ( jokingly) because she was 1 day overdue.  Well he should of told that to the bussers that were just standing there!!!! We probably won't be back again.  I gave two stars for the rolls and our server.  We will not go back there again."}
{"text":"I spent $90 and they want me to pay for dips. Customer services sucks, bad attitude by the receptionist that was taking the odder. I had to stay outside in the hot sun of 100°. Other pizza places always put dips and napkins when you buy pizza from them. I can't imagine that they didn't give me napkins or dips. I'm not going back there next time. The wings wasn't that good. I will NOT recommend anyone to this location or any of their franchise period."}
{"text":"We stay at hotels right here often and we always go to RoadHouse! We always sit at the bar...and love the bartenders! Steph, Claire and Stew are the best!  Everything is always cooked just perfectly (thank you to the kitchen) and the service is on point! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Hate. This places gives us a hassle every time we are here about having a party of 10. They refuse to push tables together and want to have us sit at separate tables.    We're here with 11 people for two family birthdays, 3 of our guests are in from california, and once again they're arguing with us about letting us all sit together.  Hey let's have a family birthday dinner and all sit and eat separately! We can catch up next year when you come back from California to visit! No biggie.   Our waiter was great and we'll take care of him, then it's yeehaw and see ya.   Sorry Texas roadhouse, this is goodbye. We'll take our hundreds of dollars and go to a place that wants to accomodate its CUSTOMERS instead of arguing with them. I'll never, ever be back."}
{"text":"Ate at TR today. A little too noisy for me. Food was just ok. First time, last time I will eat there. Red Lobster right next door. Nice and quiet in there. Really...food was very average. Just like Texas."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Friday evening of all times. We did use the call ahead seating and it worked beautifully!  Got there gave them the confirmation number and was seated right away..no wait.  We were asked if we had been before which we had but had been along time. She recommended something for us. We were greeted by our server immediately.  She asked about drinks and appetizers first. We did order the fried pickles as an appetizer.  She put in that order and got our drinks as we looked at the menu.  We both ended up odering the Road kill chopped steak. Thinking it was some strange or cheap cut of steak. What we got was an awesome burger made with chopped steak piled with sautéed onions mushrooms and cheese! I got the green beans while my husband got the loaded baked potato and we both got the house salad.  The meat was very tasty and didn't require any steak sauce which I usually use. The mushrooms and onions that came ontop were very good.  The greenbeans were awesome like they had been stewing allday, with a hint of bacon flavor. The only complaint I have about the greenbeans is that they were too hot temperature wise to eat right way. The fried dill pickle appetizer was awesome. The dip that comes with it is good but I prefer ranch so I used what was leftover from my salad for that. Even the house salad was good which can be hit or miss for me at restaurants.  The greens were very cold and they actually aren't afraid to put cheese on their salad like most places.  Our server was great,very attentive and friendly.  The bill was about 30 dollars before tip and I brought home what I didn't finish. All in all it was a great meal and will definitely be going back. I have to say I do feel sorry for Outback which is right next door..given a choice I would pick Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"I will always celebrate Veteran's day at Texas Roadhouse. They really know how to honor people who are serving in our military or have served. The staff was awesome. They were plesent, honoring, respectful and very attentive. The food was excellent and very plentiful. The menu had a lot of selections for the veterans. Thank you Texas Road House for doing it right for the veterans."}
{"text":"This was a \"never again\" experience.  We needed to go to Ikea so stopped in for lunch.  We can't even finish shopping because the salads in the car will spoil.  Cold, salty food,  limp fries and salads after entrees.  Just a \"really?\"  with no attempt to address our concerns.  No thank you I'll pass."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and typically have had a good experience. I'd say, it's been awhile since I've felt like an inconvenience to a business that's taking MY money like I had this previous visit to TRH. From my water to my 12oz steak (or 6oz of steak, 6oz fat), and my mini, over-cooked sweet potato. Or the plethora of different drinks we DIDN'T order in place of the drinks we DID order. Two stars for the ice doing well keeping my water  cold.   I think we'll continue extending the time between visits to this TRH and consider better options just down the street on Ray Rd."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for a chain. It can get very crowded and you might have a small wait on weekends or special holidays. Food is good, but can tend toward the salty side. Try the filet medallions over rice. Green bean and corn sides are great. The all you can eat rolls with cinnamon sweet butter are heavenly and I always eat way too many."}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the 10 year old urine funk smell in the ladies room. The meal was great and our server was everything you'd want."}
{"text":"Last night was our third visit to the Texas Roadhouse and I must say the first two were great, but they were with larger groups  (8 & 10 people).  Yesterday there was just the two of us. First problem:  we arrived around 4:30 and asked the young lady at the desk for a booth. When they took us to the table she showed us the worst one in the house. It was the first table you come to after you leave the desk. Right on the corner where everyone walks as they enter the dining area. I resisted and she took us to a nice two person booth in the middle of the restaurant.  A nice young man took our drink order and when they arrived we ordered our dinners. We both ordered Ribeye steaks (she a 10 oz & me a 12 oz) and salads. We had been waiting about 15 minutes when he came by and said our steaks would be right out. My wife said \"wait a minute, we haven't got our salads yet\". He was surprised and fetched them right up. He also hinted that we better eat fast because the steaks were ready. Another server brought them before we were finished.  My wife's dinner was fine, but mine was a ripoff. I ordered Sautéed Mushrooms on my steak but they were over cooked and they covered the meat. I say \"covered the meat\" because it was half fat. I couldn't see that until I cut into it. When I got finished trimming the fat I had about 6 oz of eatable meat. I showed it to our server and he brought over the manager. She offered another steak or a discount. I took the discount. I blame the chief. He should have trimmed the steak and served it as a 6 oz. Ribeye.  I gave them three stars because I think the manager cared about us and tried to fix the problem. I don't think anyone else did."}
{"text":"Thursday after my hubby's doctor's appointment at which we got good news, we decided to go out to dinner to celebrate.  We love Texas Roadhouse and usually eat at the one on North Metro Parkway, but decided to try the new Happy Valley location because it's closer.  We were early so no wait.  It was clean--no peanut shells on the floor.  The hostess was welcoming and asked if we'd like to sit in the bar area.  We said sure. Good table.  Drink order given and quickly filled.  Our waiter was a pleasant young man and took our orders.  I always get a salad with my meal and my hubby always gets a bowl of chili.  His chili was served but no salad.  He, being a gentleman, would not begin eating until my salad was served.  Ten minutes later the salad came and his chili, of course, was cold.  No problem with the food--my steak and shrimp were excellent.  His beef tips were very good.  My rating is for service.  Not that busy; plenty of staff running around.  Seems like a fairly routine accomplishment to serve first course dishes together.  We will still enjoy eating there and hopefully they will get all the kinks worked out as a new establishment."}
{"text":"After my last review and email to them, I got a call from the managing partner and a letter. That was a first and I was impressed. I'm happy to report that we finally went back to this location just this past Tuesday (Nov 3) and what a difference! We went as soon as they opened at 4. We ordered the same thing and everything was perfect! We had an excellent waitress. Joselynn (hope I spelled that right) now only was extremely friendly, but very attentive. Place was clean and everyone was working as expected. Will gladly go back."}
{"text":"iews 5   4   3   2   1      3.9 27 reviews Steve King Steve King in the last week We ordered drinks at the bar while we waited to be seated. Diet coke, lemonade and one beer. I was the only one ordered a drink at the table. When we ordered, I specifically asked for steamed vegetables,  no butter. Asked if they could do it. Apparently they can, but don't.  They replaced them with wilted microwaved carrots and broccoli.  I am allergic to milk.  They apologized. My fries weren't with my order, either. My lemonade sat empty, until the waiter brought the tab and I requested a refill. Our friend's beer was done before the food arrived,  he wasn't offered another or water or anything.  The final nail in the worst dining experience I have ever had was being charged for the lemonade and diet coke again. The steak was good, that's the only reason I didn't rate it a 1."}
{"text":"We ate here while at Great Wolf Lodge. The prices are average for a steakhouse. My husband picked his own steak and really enjoyed it. The chili was outstanding and he loved his meal. I had a smaller ribeye off the menu and thought it was an average ribeye. The seasoning we use at home and what they use at Outback was more my style. Overall, it was a good experience for me and great for my husband. Even though it was a higher priced meal, it was half the cost of eating dinner at GWL."}
{"text":"Idiots cant cook a steak to save their lives. on my third visit I told the manager about my previous over cooked steaks before I ordered. My steak came out well done again. The manager delivered it to me personally. Idiots! If your going to post a \"cooking Legend\" on your menu to describe how your steak will be prepared maybe show it to the cooks first."}
{"text":"The price/ value is fantastic.  I got the filet, medium rare and it was cooked perfect.  My husband got the ribeye and ribs combo.  The rib meat was tender, flavorful and \"fell of the bone\".  Salads are fresh and dressings homemade.  Rolls are incredibly hot, buttery and addicting.  The food quality is exceptional for a chain.  We feel comfortable taking our kids here and have had consistent good service."}
{"text":"20 oz. ribeye was delish, cooked to perfection. Skinny margarita was the best ever with fresh squeezed lime & orange juice & texas style, large only 180 calories."}
{"text":"This place is always busy and it's because the food is delicious and the servers are friendly. Ally was friendly and went out of her way to fulfill our kids requests which including replaying the song the servers dance too and she tried teaching them the dance. She was great!"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning here last night. This location has had health code violations for not washing hands. Never go here."}
{"text":"Have it your way Steaks, hand picked by you!  Can't belive the flavor that's inside.  Good service. Drinks are not watered-down like some places I visit. Family friendly.  Good Place."}
{"text":"Every time I have gone to Texas Roadhouse I have been impressed. The steaks are always great.  Yesterday we went with a group of 9 and yes we did have to wait but they have a great bar area and the prices are right.  The atmosphere made the time fly. If you want great food at a good price this is a must visit.  The buns they being out with honey butter is a gotta try!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. My husbands salad had a small bug. Probably because of the leaves. He didn't say anything but didn't finish. His steak was medium rare and he asked for medium, my steak was well done which I love but it was too dry. \"Longhorn\" still the best. The hostess was very friendly but may not be back."}
{"text":"This is are first time to North Carolina. The waitress we had was amazing. She had the best customer service skills. The place was clean and food was perfect. We are here for a week and we will be back."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. There were six of us; five said their meals were okay (steaks), and I was the lone dissenter. Had the steak kabob. The meat was tender, along with veggies, but the marinade was overpowering and the rice was not tasty. Would recommend no marinade for a good meal. But will probably return and try something else."}
{"text":"We went to eat there recently and everything was superb.. The homemade rolls with honey cinnamon butter are the best around... And if you like ribs they literally fall off the bone. You can pick out a hand cut steak and they have salmon, shrimp and chicken dishes as well. The atmosphere is fun and friendly, with the wait staff doing line dances once every hour...not to mention the wait staff is on top of it!!  You'll never get a better deal anywhere in town."}
{"text":"Food is AMAZING! here.  Portion sizes are a little too big though in my opinion... many people would consider this a positive (I don't though)."}
{"text":"The service was descent, atmosphere loud as usual, and wait time was rather short for a saturday night around 6:00 pm. Our waiter was friendly and super energetic! For as busy as it was he was very attentive. However, this review was about my food. I had the Roadhouse Steak Salad (or something like that) and it was decent. I didnt eat much or it and took it home. Oh how I wish I had finished it there so I could have shown the manager the piece of BROKEN CERAMIC in my salad. Alas...a few hours later I sat down to nibble on it and nearly broke my tooth on it! Now I dont want to finish the salad in fear of chipping my tooth or ripping my intestines open with sharp ceramic pieces! Needless to say it will be a long before I ever return to a Texas Roadhouse!"}
{"text":"We came in to celebrate our grand daughters birthday.  Or easier Kyle was very nice and did a great job as our easier.  We were disappointed to discover that the wait staff in Texas Roadhouses no longer does line dances on cue. We do understand that this is not the resyaurants fault but we had told our 8 year old to expect the dancing.  Aside from that our birthday celebration made a great memory. The service and food was good, service was very good as well."}
{"text":"visited on sunday 2:pm. about 20 minutes wait for food on the table. terrific ribeye. good service. around $35(all cost included) per person. will go again."}
{"text":"Food is average and the portions are really bad. I wouldn't recommend this place.  My friends and I were embarrassed by the portions. I can't imagine the servers must be very proud of their restaurant due to the presentation of the food. It was so pitiful.   My buddy ordered a burger and they literally brought it on a gigantic plate with nothing else on it. And my steak, shrimp, and vegetables did not come with vegetables. I guess ordering the salad cancels out the veggies. Also on the menu the shrimp is supposed to be on a bed of rice. What I got was a table spoon of rice.   Maybe the cook was having a bad day. Either way it's no excuse. Don't go here. Eat at Panda Express. It costs less than half and you get more food too.  I bet they only give you peanuts and biscuits to fill you up so that you don't care about the embarrassing portions however I was still hungry and ate more peanuts after the meal was done."}
{"text":"The food was the worst in awhile.   I had the bone in rib eye.  The steak was tough and full of grissle.  Huge disappoint to say the least.  After chewing the first few bites for 5 minutes I had to spit it out before I need the hyminlyic.  I will try one of the places next door next time.  Texas Roadhouse is off the A list for awhile."}
{"text":"Dove with Pro Diver's in Kehi Maui today.  Great crew. Very attentive, pleasant,  and willingness to make sure you have a positive experience is apparent.  Definitely recommend them for your scuba diving."}
{"text":"I'm not alone , the music is way to loud,  If you dare say anything , the response was sarcastic , \" this is a loud restaurant\" \" sorry we have no control,, The food and service is good, but if you cannot relax and enjoy communicating with other, it's not worth it.  4 out of 6 times it was stupid loud ( the back ground music and omg, there happy birthday gig  I have a lot of elderly clients, including my parents, they went there once, and never will go back,  I hope I made my point, owner, your in house personnel don't care.  Enough is enough , this last visit will be my last, sorry,,"}
{"text":"I usually get the macaroni and cheese and the fried pickles are amazing also try the steak fries"}
{"text":"The server is rude and did not check on me quite  often as he did with other customers, and then most awkward and embarrassing thing happened to me at this place. After using the restroom for 20 min, I came back to my table. My food were gone, my table was taken by someone else.seriouly? What the fuck! I am not done with my dinner and I haven't paid my check yet! My only guess is I am not white and my server is a fuckin racist!"}
{"text":"Told our party our table was being bussed, then kept us waiting for 70 minutes and counting despite our reservation. No vegetarian options despite it being 2011. If someone insists on going here, let them go alone."}
{"text":"Great place! I moved to Goodyear about a year ago and have been trying all the restaurants in the area. Have returned to Roadhouse several times since the food and the service is amazing here. Have been here at least once a month for a year and have not 1 single negative thing to say. Extensive menu, a lot of food for your money and great service especially at the bar. My husband and I usually eat at the bar since the line for getting a table can sometimes be long and we can sit immediately if we choose to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Not one to return to in my book.  Food is meh. I had ribs and they were very tender but charred in places. The barbecue sauce was meh. Free rolls with cinnamon butter were also meh. I didn't care about the free peanuts. I thought the snake bites (jalapeno poppers) tasted good.... There were screaming babies and toddlers, and obnoxiously loud country music. I've lived in Texas, and I never experienced a place like this in Texas.   I might have enjoyed the ambiance more if I was very inebriated.  When I sat down, it was at a portion of table that was dirty from a prior diner. I then got a plate (for the complimentary rolls) that had what looked like old cheese stuck to it.  It took forever for our drinks to come...then it took forever for our order to be taken. It took 45 minutes to get our food from when we ordered it. ---In a nicer setting, this wouldn't have bothered me. All in our large party agreed we would not return per the noise level.  They made a mistake with one of our party's meals, and it took awhile to get the right meal. Any time something was needed, it took what I thought was a surprising amount of time to rectify. Our server was personable.  We attempted to call ahead (they don't take reservations)...and were put on hold for a long time and then hung up on...We finally got through to someone 45 minutes later. She had trouble hearing us (I think as the restaurant is so loud). We had to wait another 45 minutes after arrival.   This place is busy. I don't really get the interest/fuss about it."}
{"text":"We came here after we landed in Charlotte. It was great. We were a party of 6 from out of town and even though we got there at 9:30 when they close at 10 they still took us in and were awesome. Sarah was our server and she was so awesome! She totally made coming here worthwhile! She was happy and energetic and didn't seem at all bothered that we got there right before closing time. We loved their bread so we asked for some to go, and even though they had thrown all the leftover bread out, they baked a fresh tray for us to take with us since we are from out of town. So the cook and the baker were also awesome. Overall a great experience. Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I used to work at Texas Roadhouse in Utah, so I know how things are supposed to go here.  The bread was over cooked, and it took an hour for literally ONE plate of a teeeeeny little sirloin, corn, and potatoes.  I was the only one ordering food, and they couldn't get my plate to me quicker than one hour?  The waitress never came to check up on us or apologize for the wait.  My steak was over-cooked and ruined.   Not a good experience here and not how things should be at Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Whatever you do don't call ahead!!!  I called ahead so I wouldn't have to wait as long when I got there and when I only had 5 minutes to wait (wait time was 40 min) I went inside to let them know I am here and they had the nerve to tell me that I had to wait an addition 30 to 40 minutes!  The whole point of calling ahead was so I didn't have to keep waiting!  Needless to say, they haven't made a very good impression so far!  It took them an additional 45 minutes to get my food.  The rolls were only half buttered on top, the food was not done properly and I got sick after eating it..... But hey it is your choice if you want to go here or not.  The question for you is..... Is it worth it?"}
{"text":"My sons and I went to this restaurant last week and I was very pleases with the restaurant. Has a family atmosphere and even though it was very busy we received great service.  This was my first time here but my sons second or third. Lots of food so we also took home food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. We have been going there for years and never had a bad experience. The food is always prepared the way we want it. Staff is friendly and great margaritas."}
{"text":"Very impressed , so much better than Outback steakhouse and a very fun place to eat . From now on when ever we are in town this is where we are going."}
{"text":"So happy to have this restaurant built in Norterra! Only problem is the center seriously needs to figure out the parking situation! There is absolutely no where to park with the theater next to it! The staff is friendly and food is great, but you are walking so much business because there is no where to park"}
{"text":"Love Texas Roadhouse.  The service is great.  The hostess staff is always very friendly.  The call ahead seating is a great feature to cut down the wait time.  Great value for the food."}
{"text":"We had GREAT service. Thank you to our waitress Tavia.  Every staff member we came in contact with was welcoming.    They don't take reservations but they do 'call ahead seating' I highly recommend doing that. We went on a Saturday night so we called and put our name in, there was a 40-50 minute wait.  So we were able to continue shopping before heading over.  We were seated soon after arriving. And they were packed. Bread and cinnamon butter was fresh and delicious.   It was a really fun atmosphere, staff does a line dance about once an hour which is really fun and cute.    We ordered the prime rib which was good.  Next time we are going to try the filet.  They only do pork ribs, which we don't care for.  Maybe some day they will make beef ribs. Prices are reasonable. We were really impressed.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Hands down the food makes this place!!! Price is very reasonable,  you get a lot of food. Complimentary bread and peanuts. Ribs have been THE BEST I've ever tasted and they had a lot meat, I got the chicken and ribs combo and didn't even touch my chicken. Their sweet tea was good. Even the baked potato was good. Good environment but the service set the tone, from the greeter to our great waiter (very courteous and attentive) to being thanked our way out. I will definitely be back, thank you for a great experience :)"}
{"text":"We went on Valentine's and I must say the food was really good. My steak was perfect, which hardly ever happens; hats off to the cooks who were slammed. The service was mediocre. The waitress kept talking to us about herself, when all we really wanted is  for her to take our order and leave us alone. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Doug was the most amazing server! He made our visit so enjoyable, got us exactly what we needed and didn't rush us at all. The food was fantastic, cooked to perfection. I definitely recommend this location, and if you can, get Doug as your server."}
{"text":"Always really busy and parking isn't great.  Interesting touch with the barrels full of peanuts to munch while you wait for a table.  Service was on par for most sit down chains.  Food was average as well.  Saving grace is the rolls and butter so good!  Birthdays are interesting too,  they have the birthday boy/girl sit on a Saw horse!"}
{"text":"The cinnamon butter and fresh, hot rolls are so delicious and addictive that you could almost forget that you came for steak. Almost. The steak here is by far the best out there. They always cook my ribeye steak perfectly without drying it out or burning it. It is juicy, tender perfection. There is always a wide range of steak preferences in my party when we come here, yet they always get it perfect for everyone."}
{"text":"This location is always disappointing from the food to the service. The servers are cheerful but very neglectful, always chatting amongst themselves. We only saw our actual server when she took order, dropped off the drinks, and dropped off the bill. Nothing in between. Which was highly unfortunate as my friend even had a dead fly under her salad leaves that she unfortunately didn't see until after she had eaten half of the salad. Our waitress was nowhere to be found and the random server that we did manage to flag down did not seem surprised or even slightly disgusted at the dead fly salad, she just asked if my friend wanted the soup instead. This place is in desperate need of a health inspection! As if the dead fly salad and poor service were not bad enough, the steaks were tasteless and dry. For a steakhouse, they should know how to cook a decent steak. Lastly, the rolls were tough and not fresh. These issues are certainly specific to this particular location as the Texas Roadhouse off Stapley/I-60 has great service, no health concerns, and makes juicy, perfect steaks every time. Best to go to the Stapley location instead and just avoid this Gilbert Rd location all together."}
{"text":"We went here as a large group (entire softball team and families). The restaurant was super accommodating and they basically gave us an entire section to ourselves and we had multiple servers at our disposal.  Being from CA the prices were lower than I was used to which was a nice surprise. However, the better surprise was the extraordinary service provided by the staff.  They were always available, attentive, helpful and very friendly. They gave us all our options for splitting checks and how to best get our players served their food.  I was impressed with the responsiveness to say the least. Additionally, considering we were such a large group (at least 30 people) we were in and out of there in about 90 minutes!  And they had really good food! The only downside (for me) was I could tell that everything was cooked in butter, some people really like that but not me. Other than though it was great experience!"}
{"text":"This is my 1st time at this location & I have  to say my experience has been far better than the desert sky location! Our waitress Shelly Mac is the best!!!! She made sure to check on us on top of bringing those sweet rolls to our table. Our food came out really quick and was delicious. We will be coming back to this location for sure!"}
{"text":"Normally the service is fine and the food is great. The psychology of reviews is that people post when they are unhappy, and I am not any different. When we arrived we were told 20-25 minutes, which is expected, its a very busy roadhouse location. Then we watched as people who came in after us get seated before us. At first I thought these people had reservations, until I watched a group our size who came in 10m after us, and were told the same time frame, get seated before us. When I went up to ask what was going on, they seemed to forget we were even waiting despite the fact that she had given us the pager. They had no idea what happened, and continued to take and seat other groups while trying to figure out the situation, which is really just unacceptable.   Once we were seated, the service was fine, the food was timely, and served correctly, the only redeeming factor."}
{"text":"These Cooks can't cook worth a crap! They wear there earbuds when they cook and are laughing and having a great time like they are working in some kind of crapping bar. They don't pay attention when cooking your food and they let it burn   Or it is raw. We have eaten at Texas Roadhouse since it was open at this location and we love it but it needs work and has gotten worse over the years and we have to send our food back about every single time!!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this location for over 5 years. Best prime rib for the price and awesome margaritas. Haven't been for about 6 months but decided take the 30minute drive last night. Call ahead seating is always the way to go and only waited about 15min on a busy Saturday night. Hostess and waitress were very sweet but it was downhill from there. Very disappointed. We ordered our usual without looking at the menu and when my husband got his prime rib it was cold. Very cold. After just one bite we sent it back. Manager Don returned the same steak to us \"warmed\". What does that mean? How can you warm a steak with a bite out of it and with horseradish spread on top? Not back on the grill or broiler so we are to assume microwaved. Don was very condescending with his tone and was waiting for us to ask for it compted but we did not. He gave us his card and said \"next time ask for him and he would cook the food himself\". This seemed like a odd comment. As unsatisfied as we were with this product we ate and left.  I understand they are a very busy place and know the odds of every plate coming out perfect every time but just correct the mistake. To take a eaten steak back to the kitchen is unsanitary and just bad form. I was not surprised to read other reviews on yelp about this manager Don, he was very rude when we were nothing but pleasant and understanding about the situation. He seems a bit jaded about customer complaints and comes to you assuming the worst. Would have been better if our nice waitress would have just brought the food back, her customer service skills were much better."}
{"text":"We were in town for 2 days and decided to have a family dinner at texas roadhouse. We have 2 near us and have always been very happy. We were a group of 5 adults and 3 kids. We made reservations and were seated promptly upon arrival. The atmosphere was great (same as the ones near us). Our waitress had a WONDERFUL personality. Seriously, I haven't had a happier/nicer waitress in a very long time! She was also very considerate of my father in law who is hard of hearing. The food was great. The service was great. The rating is due to the bar experience which was totally out of our waitresses hands. My mom ordered chardonnay. She received skunk'd wine. It was warm and had a vineger taste to it and slightly cloudy. She drinks chardonnay all the time and couldn't make it past 1 sip. She would have normally exchanged for another wine HOWEVER every single drink at the table was messed up so she opted just for water, she didn't want to give it a 2nd chance. My Mother in law ordered a whiskey sour, she received whiskey on the rocks. My father in law ordered vodka/7up w/ no ice (he is very sensitive to ice as he is in his late 80's) and he got a cup LOADED with ice (he was scrooping it out onto a place. I ordered the hurrican margarita w/ a kicker on the rocks and sugar rimmed. Now I don't know if this particular texas road house only does frozen drinks? The ones near me (countryside and tinley park) both serve this automatically on the rocks, you have to ask for it to be blended, so that is what I am accustomed to. My glass was also not sugar rimmed and only about 3/4 of the way full. My husbands sangria was the only drink that came out \"ok\". The waitress was very appologetic and again, very friendly. We were in on 3/30/16 at 5:30."}
{"text":"I had to give this place a second chance. It wasn't a really clean experience but the food here is great! The workers are really nice and friendly. Wait wasn't that long.   I will be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"If you haven't eaten at Texas Roadhouse yet, I suggest you give it a shot!  This place is much like the other locations I've been to.  The food isn't gourmet level, but you can get a great meal here.  Full bar and great service!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad steak from here, and my son loves that he can throw his peanut shells on the floor and I won't get onto him about cleaning it up LOL.. Prices are moderate but the food is great."}
{"text":"The steaks came out overdone. We wanted them medium rare throughout the steaks, instead of them trying to correct the problem, they tried to justify it. The manager came over and tried to justify the overcooked steaks also.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"The only place that knows how to cook a steak the way I order it, we'll done, medium well...etc. Prices are better than any other steakhouse I've ever tried. I recommend the sirloin, mashed potatoes, chili, salad, ribs..."}
{"text":"They lure you in with the sweet rolls, but it's downhill from there.   Between a party of three we ordered a grilled chicken salad, a full rack of ribs, and a burger. It took about 30 minutes to arrive after ordering (our server actually said, without prompting, \"I don't know why it's taking so long, let me check on it.\"). The salad was inferior to what I can order from the lunch room in my office building (which costs only $7). The ribs had a nice flavor but we're a bit dry. I didn't personally try the burger but it looked pretty plain and was not what I would have expected from a steak joint.   I would give only two stars, but solid service and a funny rendition of Happy Birthday provided to a neighboring table, combined with the endless peanuts and rolls as apps, get it back to a low three stars."}
{"text":"Got the filet mignon. Was like eating leather belt, however,  they did not charge me, but I insisted they try mine and would not, friend tried it and said it was horrible!! Dont think i will ever go there again."}
{"text":"Always like the food here.  Quite loud though. Waiter was very quiet and is not Texas Roadhouse material to me. He was nice though."}
{"text":"Rattlesnake bites are the best. I haven't had a bad experience here ever. They are organized and accommodating. Food is always on point."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe the place was as busy as it was before 5PM on a weekday.  Despite the crowds, service was great and the food was outstanding.  The atmosphere was entertaining for the kids as well.  We did have one problem with our meal but the server took care of it right away and the manager came by to make sure we were good.  Nice service!"}
{"text":"Second times the charm?  Not in this case.  We went a couple of weeks ago in the evening, an we figured it was busy so maybe that's why is wasn't so good.  We came back today, and all three of us (wife, son, and myself) all didn't like our meals.  I did sign up for their birthday club, which gets you a free appetizer, which is a good deal, because I would have had it removed from the bill.  Onion blossom.....really weird almost chemical taste.  The sirloin was good, the filet was good, the burger.... Not so much.  Fries were soggy, I asked for crispy...... No problem, the sent them back looking nice and brown.....and still soggy.  Not sure how that happened but it really did.  Our waitress was nice, but not very fast.  Every plate including the bread plates, were left on the table.   I thought when the entrees were brought out they would clear the table, but sliding and shuffling was more convenient for her I guess.  Cool looking restaurant, but it's definitely not for us."}
{"text":"Long wait but we had a party of 9, our server was very good and the hot rolls and honey cinnamon butter is always a treat! Our meals were good, I had the roadkill dinner, others in our party ordered ribs, chicken, pork chops and pulled pork dinner! Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Been to Texas Roadhouse but this was my first experience at the Metro location. Right away we were greeted and sat at a table within minutes. The greeter asked us if we have ever been to that location and let her know we had not and she said well we are definitely the best one. She sure was right. The waitress was great at keeping us stocked with fresh bread with that cinnamon butter YUUUUMMM and our drinks full. # of us order the prime rib and one the cowboys cut steak. It was all SOOO good. Even the onion blossom we had as an appetizer was delicious. It was a little greasy at the bottom but that's to be expected when it's deep fried. Overall was very very pleased with our experience. The dance the staff does is also pretty cool and created a fun environment. Overall the food was great and the all the staff seemed energetic and eager to help and make you comfortable. As we walked out, I don't think there was one person we walked by that did not thank us for coming in. Definitely will be back to this location!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the main reason to go to Texas Roadhouse is for the rolls and cinnamon butter, also if you like peanuts there are plenty to snack on while you wait for your table.  At this location there is always at least a 30min wait and really the only way to avoid this is to use their call ahead feature, which puts your name on the list before you leave your home.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is always a bit on the loud side.  In the event of someone's birthday everyone in the place screams \"yee-ha\" so that gets old quick.  Other than that the food is always decent for the price and my personal recommendation is the sirloin kebob."}
{"text":"Great experience! We used the call ahead option and were seated within 15 minutes.  No-pay juke box lets patrons help set the mood by choosing  the music-  peanut shells on the floor, all creates a lively, informal atmosphere, perfect for the graduations we were celebrating.   Blew my diet by starting with a cactus bloom- fried onion appetizer-  nice flavorful batter.  I ordered the California grilled chicken and was very surprised at how moist and flavorful it was.  Most chain restraints don't seem to time chicken well but they nailed it.  House salad was unimpressive and could not find a hint of blu cheese in the dressing. Next time I would order loaded mashed over baked potato.  All this being said-  the reason for this review is to give a shoutout to our server -  Cathy was friendly, efficient, professional -  she is what I hope for, personal without being over bearing.  We all loved her.. The food is ok but the service is awesome"}
{"text":"Had dinner here yesterday. The service was amazing!! Never had to wait for drinks or rolls. Even was given extra rolls and drinks along with my to-go boxes. The ribs were the best I ever had. Definitely recommend and I will be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place! ... Well used to.. We went here for dinner and left the WORST FOOD POISON EVER (24 hours of puking and sh*tting! Not to mention we have 2 small children that walk up in the night for feeding's.. I had to call a sitter to come over at 7am because we were to weak to get out of bed. EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!"}
{"text":"The steak is really good...especially smothered in onions! The only think you have to be careful of is eating too many of their delicious rolls with cinnamon butter before dinner. The wait staff is alway fun and upbeat and we really enjoy the dancing they do.  The only negative is long waits, if you go after 5 on a Friday or Saturday night expect to wait at least a half hour.  The good news is you can call ahead and then the wait is not too bad."}
{"text":"This place was a favorite of mine, but is quickly dropping off that list. the reason for this is the service! The last two times I've been, the food has been great, hot, delicious,  and plenty to fill me up and still take some home, and I definitely love their reasonable priced large draft beers :-) My problem is with the servers, the last two were both moody, non attentive, and last night she straight up told me No when I asked for a water, and wasn't joking, I had to finally ask the other woman who brought our food as I had waited from ordering until then to see if she was kidding...  I  realize you're busy, especially on a weekend night, but don't take your bad day out on my family and I, she never smiled once, visited our table a total of maybe 5 times including to cash us out,  which we sat with empty plates for over 10 minutes waiting for our check before she came and asked \"do you need any boxes\" umm no thanks, we don't want any more drinks or anything either even though you didn't ask.   Anyway, to the management, I hope you work on your staff, because by the comments, it's not only me that sees the poor service and I'm willing to give you guys one more chance because I love the food and drinks, etc, but if you blow that, you've lost another customer."}
{"text":"we decided to try out this place since we were tired of everything else...and wow! we made the right choice!! the food is great the staff is friendly, they have a good menu and im looking forward to going again soon!"}
{"text":"Something has changed over the last six months or so... And it's terrible. Either it got new owners or the current owner decided being cheap was better than good food. I've always gotten the same meal from here. We got food to go about two months ago, and the rolls were different and not good. Then we decided to brave the crowd for Mother's Day... Worst choice ever. My 10 oz ribeye was thin as thin could be, and over cooked. The sweet potato was dry even after I smothered it in butter. I asked them to please make me another meal and it came out exactly the same. The manager was nice and took my meal off the bill. My husband ordered a very nice filet and it was also smaller than listed weight and over cooked. The manager politely argued with him and he refused to send it back because she was arguing. So we paid over 30 bucks for a crappy dinner. The only good thing was the shrimp appetizer. We will not be returning here on the future."}
{"text":"My wife and I were excited to try the Tempe Texas RH because I'd heard good things about the food from my co-workers and I hadn't been to one of their locations in quite a few years.  The place was hopping and thankfully, we used the call-ahead feature and only had to wait about 5-7 minutes.  Fun atmosphere and the starters (salad/bread) were good.  However, I am a \"steak-guy\" and that's the main reason I was there.  And for that, I was very disappointed.  My ribeye was tough to chew - so much so that I didn't even continue eating it after 3 bites.  Anyone who knows me will attest that I love steak and it's rare that I meet one that I don't like...especially at a steakhouse.  But this one was rubbery/dry/tough.  Our server (who was average at best) didn't really apologize, but looked at me suspiciously.   She said the manager would come over to talk to our table, but that didn't happen.  Fortunately, they took my steak off of our bill.  That was appreciated, but I would have much preferred my evening if I had paid for and eaten a great steak."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner, the food runner dropped a whole side of ranch on my sons brand new car seat (mind you he's not even a week old). She didn't even say sorry she just ran off with our food still in her hands and never even came back to apologize. After that nightmare I was told to have it dry cleaned and bring my receipt back for reimbursement which I did and even called before I went in to make sure I would be reimbursed that day and was told I could not be reimbursed until the manager could confirm my receipt...this place is SUCH a joke and the manager Kerry is the most unprofessional person I have ever encountered. I wouldn't even give this place 1 star!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. The customer service is good. Not much to say it's just your typical big box food chain."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure. I have visited quite a few times and have yet to be disappointed. The steak is delicious and the sides have great flavor. A great value for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Five stars for the beer. Beer is served in a frosty mug with near slushy like consistency...damn, I need to get there tonight!"}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is a consistent restaurant. Every time you walk in, you are asked if you want to pick out your own steak. Once seated, you are greeted with delicious rolls and peanuts to munch on before your meal arrives. The steaks and sides are of great quality.   The service is prompt and you should have little to no problems with waiting irregular amounts of time for service.   Happy Eating"}
{"text":"Delish!  The bread is awesome!!!!! My kids loved it!!! The butter!!!! (I had a little bit).  OMG!!!!  Went to drop off my son at the Polytechnic Campus --and went to eat dinner here --My family liked it.  Go there!!! Now!!! :-)"}
{"text":"The sweet tea is great and the bread rolls are delicious!  The steaks are good and fairly priced... The service is good/professional - I wish they'd build one up in north Peoria area... JM"}
{"text":"I ate here with my family and we generally had a good experience, with one exception.  The green beans. I was expecting real, steamed and seasoned green beans. What we got, instead, were canned beans mixed with some sort of nasty pork product. They were vile. Neither my dad nor I could eat them. I also thought that the waitress should have noticed that we were eating everything but these beans and questioned why."}
{"text":"The service was great. The food was ok. The rolls we were served were sitting under a light bulb so they were light bulb warm and chewy.  I ordered the prime rib; my husband the pulled pork; and my son the half chicken. They were just ok."}
{"text":"worst experience so far. the waitress is very impatient and rude. She even forgot to bring us forks and knives 15 minutes after the dishes were served."}
{"text":"Obviously, their bread is delicious. But if you go to this location make sure your waitress is Kalani! She provides the best costumer service and is so friendly! 5 stars baby!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants but ended up here with my family to stay close to home. I have to say the service was impeccable, the food was cooked to perfection and overall great atmosphere. We had steaks, ribs and fish and it all came out hot and fresh together. Plenty of offers to refill drinks, and fresh baked bread. Portions were large, we all had to-go boxes."}
{"text":"Ok so I get the peanut thing, wood accented atmosphere, good service (although rather \"in your face\" at times) and the packed dining room / bar even on a Thursday night.   What I don't get is the awful food. This was my FIRST (and last) visit into this franchise restaurant. How they convinced franchisees and the general public to invest and vote with hard earned dollars is beyond me.  I took my friends 11 year old there after he played in a b'ball game and after looking at the menu and pricing decided to split the rib eye special $19.99.   I got the fried pickle appetizer as well and was sorely disappointed in the batter and both of the \"dipping sauces\" (watery ranch and thousand island? I really couldn't tell).  Even a franchise like H***ers makes them WAY better......wow.  On to the main course. The baked potato with butter and cream cheese was overcooked or something? I have never had a potato that seemed to have been soaked in some type of brine and then baked? Kind of par boiled or something. Anyway the color was greyish and the taste like that of a fishy sea salt.  Moving to the broccoli i was greeted by a palor yellow looking presentation. I couldn't tell if it was cheesy cauliflower or ? Wow the taste was again that of something really overcooked or under matured...YICK  The last chance at redemption came with the medium well rib eye. Good sized portion and easily split between the two of us 20oz. Good wholesome beefy taste and great texture only to be squallored  by a heavy Saltiness....not sure where this was picked up from but maybe by hanging out too close to the potato?   I really am normally an amicable restaurant patron but after forking over $46 including tip for two to split some food and getting served what we did ...well you get my drift.  Signed,   NeverToStepFoot-InsideTheRoadhouseAgain"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the ribeye tonight, Sal the server was awesome.  Didn't know this location was even here.  Beats the long drive down Bell Rd. to Arrowhead. See you again soon."}
{"text":"They say you never ft a second chance for a First Impression......True!  We arrived to a 30-40min wait. But the music was so loud I had flashbacks to my club trotting 20's!  We'd have to yell over our steaks.  The hostess said it was only that loud for line dancing.   I'll remember that and chomp my steak between sets!!  Maybe the food was great, hence the crowds....but Since I'm not in my 20's AND I don't club hop anymore-we left and went to nearby LongHorn Steak House. Read my review about them.    If you're deaf, in your 20's and used to waiting...like for a bus, Walmart returns or a Trainee at Starbucks, you'd probably love it."}
{"text":"My server this visit was Joe. He was friendly and very attentive! I ordered the steak and rib plate with a Cesar salad and mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked a beautiful medium rare and the ribs were so render they fell off the bone. The food and service make this a 5 star experience!"}
{"text":"I always sit at bar and bartenders are very attentive and helpful. Food is usually good, minor issues at times but nothing terrible."}
{"text":"Best thing about this place is the call ahead seating. We had virtually no wait! The cinnamon butter bread was on point. Service was good and the waiter even got us a free appetizer for buying a spare cut of meat. My only real complaint is that the side dishes are truely an after thought! But this place is purely about the meat and on that end the delivered!"}
{"text":"Greeted with hot rolls.  Steak and ribs outstanding. Service XLNT"}
{"text":"I decided to take the family out to dinner to Texas Roadhouse in Peoria, AZ.  They were out of prime rib, out of broccoli, vegetables and salad! Really!??!  The ribs were good but my corn, another story... cold... the manager brought me a new bowl, it was burning hot... ridiculously hot. Wouldn't recommend it. Lots of other better choices a stones throw away..."}
{"text":"I like Texas Roadhouse. I was holding onto a certificate for my birthday for a free appetizer or sidekick of ribs. I was in the area, so decided to try this location. It was crowded when I got there at about 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon. (a good sign) I was seated right away, and my server was nice and attentive. Everything was great, except the meat. My ribs were overdone and my \"Road Kill\" was burnt on the ends and the bottom. I think it was leftovers from earlier in the day. It was dry and totally overcooked. Road Kill is smothered in cheese, mushrooms, and onions. I think the kitchen staff thought this would hide the condition of the meat. Since I had ordered \"medium,\" it did not hide anything. My server was apologetic and offered to send a Mgr over to discuss. I was not in a good frame of mind, which was why I thought a great dinner would improve it. This was not what I was looking for. I declined her offer and got boxes to take everything home. Not sure why I bothered, it just hit the trash when I got home. A real waste of money for a senior on a fixed income. I will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"TRH is top of the line for steak and fast service. The longest I have ever waited was 5 min. Very friendly"}
{"text":"Good warm food.  Customer service is good.  BUT...enough of the friggin Birthday singing and clappimg.  My wife and I have eaten here several time, but the noise and seemingly non-stop birthday singing, yelling and clapping.  We were hear a couple days ago and 5 times we had to endure this.  Stop the noise please."}
{"text":"We headed over around 7:00pm they had a 20-30 min wait. Had peanuts while waiting and got to see food being run, which looked amazing. So now to the food and service... Ordered 6oz sirloin, Caesar salad with loaded baked potato. Very tender but lukewarm. Husband had 16 oz ribeye smothered, salad and green beans with a side of ribs,  sirloin was cold.rest of food was great and came out fast, now with that said server came to table as soon as we started to eat and we were able to tell her about cold steak which she promptly took to get a new one and sent manager over. The manager was apologetic and took off steaks from meal and have my husband a new hot steak. Sever came back table many times to refill and ask about meals. I was very impressed with both sever and manager. We will come back again. Server was Lisa she's great,  Manager was Carolyn ( I think )"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that my family and I normally love Texas Roadhouse and use to go weekly when we lived in North Carolina, so we were very excited when we found this one by luck about 35 minutes from our new home. Well first time we went no problem. 2nd time we went we got a little extra added to our cheese fries... someone elses hair! Needless to say no one wanted anymore cheesefries. And the waitress acted like we were bothering her when we told her. Manager was nice & cool about it though. Fresh plate & no charge for them. Tonight we went back and was seated in the bar area, got to order our drinks fairly quickly but she bssically droppef them at the table and left, no chance to order our food. 10 minutes go by of the 2 bartenders/ waitresses ignoring the fact we were ready to order when they decided to play rock, paper, scissors over doing their jobs. We of course are all frustrated. The bar was pretty much empty, we wanted to order but they wanted to play games. My 10 year son even realized it was not cool. Finally 1 comes over to take our order after 15 minutes & their game. We order & get our food fairly quickly. Yay! Oh but wait as I start cutting into my prime rib I notice something sticking out under it... yes another hair! Really?! After about 5 minutes of everyone else eatting & me waiting to get someones attention the waitress finally comes over & ask me reluctantly if my steak was ok & I pointed out the hair. She acted like I was asking too much to not have hair in my food. Few minutes later a nice manager brings me a new plate & handled the situation nicely. But really come on people. Waitresses who do not want to do their jobs & 2 times in a row there is hair in the food. Can't say that I will go back, & am quite sad over it because in NC this place is great & 5 stars everytime."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch got seated quickly. Server was nice and helpful at first but only brought 4 rolls even though there was 5 of us... He didn't even bring anymore rolls until half way through our meal upon request... The drinks were always full which was a plus but we had to call him over several times to get condiments. He would drop the drinks off and would be gone before we could ask for condiments. The steaks were not cooked the way we ordered and were actually more on the raw side... Had to be sent back because they were too red. I've been here before and it was pretty good just must have been an off day."}
{"text":"Love Texas road house. But the one on grand ave has really bad service. They didn't have the food order. They came at the last minute and said what else  would we like. Don't even try to talk to the so called manager. Alisha she is the worst customer service representative I have ever seen at a establishment that  I liked."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to this location since it's been open and haven't had a bad meal yet.   The food is always delicious and cooked to perfection.  I am writing this review because of the awesome customer service that I received last night.  I ordered takeout last night and was told it would take twenty minutes.  When my order wasn't' ready yet when I arrived at the restaurant, the manager apologized profusely and said that my dinner (and a diet coke while I was waiting) was on him.   I was pleasantly surprised.  Even though it was completely unnecessary it made me feel special and that he appreciated my business.  Such customer service is almost unheard of in this day and age.  This kind of service deserves a five star rating in my book."}
{"text":"This is my fiancé and I's FAVORITE place for steak! You sit down and immediately get hot fresh bread that is to die for. My fiancé and I both got steaks, both of which were cooked perfectly! Juicy and delicious. Our waiter Willie was kind and quick and the manager even stopped by to say hello to us.   I only have two complaints (my reasons for four stars instead of five). The first is that my steak fries were soggy. The second is that the birthday singing is really loud and obnoxious. Nights where there are only one or two birthdays are fine, but it can get a little ridiculous some nights."}
{"text":"I always get either beef tips of the chicken critters! It's soooo much food! The bread alone I am already satisfied. They have really good service and meals always come out hot. However there have been a few times where my boyfriend has complained about it not being fresh and he had to send back his plate but they are always very accommodating. Be prepared to wait for a table though"}
{"text":"I love fried pickles and order them any time I see them on a menu. But these were sliced way too thin and didn't have any pickle flavor left. All batter. Such a shame."}
{"text":"So frustrating! Second time in a row that they forgot to include our salads in our take out order. The restaurant is far enough away that going back for them isn't worth it. Last time they mailed me a coupon for an onion appetizer which I don't like. This time we requested a refund on our credit card. Still waiting..."}
{"text":"Look this is simple. The name of the place is \"Roadhouse\" as in peanuts in a bucket on the table, throw your shells on the floor, young waiters and waitresses dancing, and STEAK!   If you want a great steak or great chicken at a very reasonable price in a simple laid back ROADHOUSE style establishment then this is great.  This is not fine dining.  Sorry no special separate booths or perfect fitting baby seats or quiet whisper dining w a waiter that is wearing a white apron.  Give me a break.  Simple..... you want great steak at low prices in a simple place then this isn't a bad choice.....you want to cry about booths and baby slings and loud kids, ummm stay home."}
{"text":"Even though I love steak in general the bartenders kinda suck here..not friendly and very pushy won't be back"}
{"text":"The service and food were good but don't expect any help if you forget anything there. A pair of nice sunglasses fell out of my jacket pocket in the booth, and even though I called 10 minutes after we left no one there could find them. To the waitress -enjoy them.  Glad it wasn't my wallet."}
{"text":"I ran to Texas Roadhouse to pick up out Togo order for work. When I got back to the office I realized they had forgotten some of my coworkers items. I had to run back to the restaurant while MY food got cold. The manager, Olivia, made me a new meal to replace the cold one and refunded my money. She went above and beyond and was very professional. Next time the guys at work (muscular moving men) are hungry we'll know where to go:)"}
{"text":"The decoration is great! But above all, the ribs are exceptional. I frequently eat them here (one full slab is more than enough to share between 2). They are fantastic! Only once they were too burned (probably once out of more than 30 times). I didn't complain about it, they probably would have replaced it."}
{"text":"This was the best Texas Road House I've been to so far. From the speed of  service the moment we walked in, to the attentiveness of the staff (especially our server Ashlyn) Everthing was on point!  And the steaks, Mmm....No need for knives here"}
{"text":"We've been to this location three timed and are apprehensive about going back. Our family has always loved Texas Roadhouse but this location has left a lot to be desired.  First visit, too busy and no one even talked to us about getting our name on the list.  Second visit, they inverted how each one of us wanted our steak cooked, didn't bring requested steak sauce, and overall poor service.  Third visit, very poor service AND there were long hairs in not one but TWO dishes we were served. My nice got a hair in her salad which we tried to move past but it was followed up with a hair in her chicken. Plus, the chicken on my salad was pink and squishy. Terrible experience. The manager apologized and gave us a gift card which was nice but it will be a while before we are able to go back and give it another chance. Ugh!"}
{"text":"average food quick appetizers, called ahead to let them know we we're coming with 15 to 20 people and was put on eternal hold,once we arrived Sat us pretty quick and Paige our server did a nice job,only suggestion is invest in a real oven,microwaved baked potatoes are not good"}
{"text":"If I could leave zero stars, I would! I took my sister and her family of 5 out for a nice dinner at this location to celebrate the New Year. My sister and I decided to share the $21+ Ribeye. It was delicious up until she was taking her last bite and found a HAIR soaked in the juice of the steak. Absolutely disgusting! Teresa, the manager, said the 20% off our receipt and the Ribeye comp was sufficient. She even went as far to say that, \"its human error, your food poisoning should last only 24hrs. I'm sorry, what else do you want me to do?\" I expressed that I was feeling nauseas and would probably be puking all night long. To top it off, the bread basket had remains of melted cheese and salad from the previous patrons. The waiter, Paul, was not phased. And not to mention, my sister and her family go there once a month! I'm never going back!"}
{"text":"I love the food at this restaurant. The prices are similar to Outback Steakhouse, and the food is comparable  (just a Southern US theme versus an Australian theme). The service was great; the server was very attentive and came back often.  My last visit, I asked for a medium-rare steak, but it was less than rare (purple in the center). I normally HATE complaining, but I couldn't eat this. The staff was extremely nice about it, put it back on the grill, and it came out perfectly. They even took $5 off of our bill without us asking.  It was appreciated."}
{"text":"Hard working daughter wanted steak for dinner, so we agreed on Texas Roadhouse. We got in before 5 on a Saturday, and had no wait for a table. Our server was Dalena, she was friendly, and good keeping up with her section. What's not to like about a place where you get a pail of unshelled peanuts, and warm rolls with cinnamon butter while you wait for your steak (or other meat)?!        For an appetizer, we ordered the french fries with cheese, and bacon bits. Not bad, but nothing extraordinary. After a long week at work, I ordered the Original Frozen Margarita, for $5.25 in a nice size glass with a nicely salted rim. It hit the spot, brain freeze, and all. My daughter had an issue with her 6oz. sirloin being over done when she wanted it cooked to medium, it was quickly replaced with a perfectly cooked sirloin no questions asked. My 12 oz. Fort Worth Ribeye was perfectly seasoned, that I skipped any extra salt, pepper, or steak sauce. Hubby ordered the Country Fried Chicken, he didn't mention too much about it.        Overall, this was the first time at this Texas Roadhouse location, which was a nice change from Fridays or Applebees. The atmosphere is fun, and casual, maybe a bit too casual in some circumstances. Some of the staff seemed younger, and not really trained on dealing with customers. Nothing terrible, but something that was noticed here."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!!   The moment you pull in to the parking lot, you know it's going to be special.   Every single person working here is trying to make your experience the very best.  The Host/Hostess, the people who seat you, the Servers, management.  Yesterday,  we had a delicious meal, the \"falling off the bones\" ribs and all of the extras.  Karly, Michael, Sydney were all very attentive.   Our beverages were constantly refilled,  without asking.  They were extremely friendly.   We spoke with the Service Manager, Megan, who was also VERY sweet.  We love this place.  It's very popular,  and because of this, there are often wait times.  It's well worth waiting.   They are very efficient so it isn't too long to be seated."}
{"text":"Not so good.  Got a terrible meal, and the waitress couldn't care less.  I spoke to a manager later and she was very nice and fixed the issue.  Still, not good food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is an A-OK for the area.  When you're a foodie in the middle of nowhere, just lower your standards a touch or two and then you can enjoy the food.  Texas Roadhouse is your run of the mill chain steakhouse (think Outback with a twang) with the standard American menu offerings.    The fried pickles were awesome!  But be careful, too many can ruin your palate.  I had the ribeye and it was cooked perfectly.  The house rolls were just out of the oven fresh.  All in all, a solid meal at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Food was great as always. The lovely ladies had the delicious crispy critters. Myself i had the strip steak cooked perfect. The sweet rolls got the best of me but I managed to get it all down."}
{"text":"Bad experience with customer service in reference to 45 minute wait to being told our group was the loudest group approached and others were loudrer - we were told to leave because we expressed out opinion.  The manager expressed his discussion with my group was to kick us out instead of discussing the situation with us."}
{"text":"I love how close this Texas Roadhouse is to my house! I definitely do appreciate having the option to call in and be put on the wait list if there is a list. It does help out with you have children. The food is awesome! Always having fresh bread available right away. The service is great as well they always seem to check and make sure everything is going good."}
{"text":"Everybody working here is so nice and friendly. I have no complaints about the employees or the food. Love the rolls and cinnamon butter!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Usually very dependable. Certainly friendly. The problem is the like.to.socialize amongst themselves. I came in to.redeem a free meal from a previous problem and was able to.get served drinks and despite reading a menu, having a napkin on my.lap I cant seem to get.my.dinner ordered. I could ask to.order but.it seems to.me that they.should serve me. 2 bad experiences in a row. Another bad one and Im out of here"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate three very special occasions--my daughter's 8th grade promotion, my son's Kindergarten promotion and my son's birthday. It was our first visit to this location and it definitely won't be the last. The food was great--tender steaks cooked perfectly, delicious warm rolls, etc. The value was amazing too, especially for a party of 6. The best part of our night was our server. We were fortunate enough to be seated in Garrett's section. Trust me when I say that he is amazing!!! He was so personable and friendly. He made great recommendations and really seemed like he genuinely liked his job. He made my kids feel special and they all commented on how great he was. So make sure you ask for Garrett when you go in. He's awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Man, I called ahead at 4:40 and was told 30 to 40 min. It's after 6, dang. Either I forgot how to tell time or they recently changed the standard for measuring time. This place used to be on point. Now the manager is yelling at us to be patience, like we haven't been for an hour and a half already. This place used to have great service but has gone to hell especially on father's day. Shame on you and your poor customer service."}
{"text":"The wait staff is excellent! But, they must have different cooks on the weekend! During the week, steaks are cooked perfectly. The weekend, everything is overcooked: ribs burned, rare burger had burned edges and the potatoes were even dry!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try Texas Roadhouse. I'm not usually down for chain steakhouses or any chain restaurants for that matter, but I thought I'd give it a chance since my mom and brother had been talking about their steaks. Chains are supposed to be known for their consistency, right? It can't be that bad? Unfortunately I wasn't impressed  I could elaborate on how all of the steaks were not cooked to order and mine even came out moo-ing, but what's the point? I gave it a chance, the food was inconsistent. Nothing was out of this world, but I did taste a piece of my mom's filet (we ordered the same thing same temp), and it was very good and tender. My brother wasn't happy with his steak either, but I honestly didn't expect anything better."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and food. Great baked sweet potatoes and fried pickles. Great place to bring friends and family."}
{"text":"Let's start with cons #1....PARKING SUCKS...con # 2 organization. Now we were told 25-40 min which was fine considering there were no parking spots. When our name was called we were stopped in the middle of all the tables by the hostess because our table was not cleaned. She apologized but still kinda annoying moving kids out of the way of kitchen staff taking food to tables. I could've waited 5 more minutes if we were taken directly to the table....pros.....well let's just say WOW! Food was spot on. Steak was to die for and that's a lot coming from a self proclaimed back yard grill professional! I had rib eye and ribs combo...and I must say it was nice to have a 3/4 lb steak and 1/2 rack of ribs cooked perfect for $20 dollars than a boring sirloin and 3 ribs for 15 dollars at most steak chain restaraunts.  Definitely would return and recommend to anyone. Organization is fixed with great food!!! Crappy parking...for us...was fixed by zaxbys! Hint hint"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times.  The food is above average for the price, but two things about this place make me sad when I'm there.  First, the employees wear a shirt that says \"I love my job!\"  Please.  This isn't an independent statement of the wearer.  This is blatant corporate mandate.  Second and a related topic is the line dancing.  They march the employees out to do some stupid line dance instead of continuing to serve the guests.  I swear I can see the waitstaff dying inside.  I imagine at some point some corporate idiot said \"Hey, why not have some line dancing.  People line dance in Texas, right?\"  Three stars because the portions are good, the food is of good quality, and it is kid friendly.  If they were a bit more serious about being a steak house, and less serious about kitschy b.s., I would be there more often."}
{"text":"For a brand new opening (one week) this was an excellent dinner. Hubby ordered 1/2 slab, I had Ft Worth rib eye. My med rare steak was a little too rare so I sent it back. The Chef brought it out to me to test taste if it were perfect. Yum. Excellent service, food, etc. and each hour the staff does line dancing in the aisles to a western song. Too much! Really enjoyed it. And of course those honey slathered hot buns!"}
{"text":"This location can get very busy on weekend nights, I recommend calling ahead for reservations. We enjoyed our meal. The prices look decent on the menu but if you want your steak smothered or a loaded baked potato then you will need to pay an extra few bucks. The service was good, waters were filled and rolls refilled."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night. It was only the second night they were open. We went early, 4:45 p.m., and were able to beat the crowds. Food is standard Texas Roadhouse food. I enjoyed a steak and loaded baked sweet potato. It was delicious. My son tried the country fried chicken and it was very good as well.  The waiter, Ty, was very attentive and checked on us often, even when the place started getting busy. I can't wait to try them again after they have been in business for a few weeks."}
{"text":"Never a problem decent food and always GREAT SERVICE. Only minor dings are load(always packed) and the you pick your steaks aren't thick enough,but for a chain a good one."}
{"text":"First off let me say that I had to stop eating my food to write this review and I left the same review on their Facebook page as well. For many years Texas has been my favorite restaurant. My bank account will tell you that I eat here at least twice a month. They have great house salads, you get a good size steak for $10 & the cinnamon butter cannot be beat!  But I cannot stress the word LITERALLY to you enough when I say that LITERALLY every single time I order my food from take out & about 85% of the time when I dine in... My food is not cooked how I ordered it & it needs to be sent back to the kitchen. Against popular opinion I enjoy my steak well done. To each their own. & by well done I mean I don't want myoglobin & water pouring out of my meat when I cut into it. It should not be pink let alone red. Well tonight's take out order was no different than my other experiences. My steak was blood red when I cut into it. You see when you drive all the way home with your food & you're excited to eat it & you cut your steak open & find that is NOT cooked how you ordered it.. & this happens REPEATEDLY! You learn to cut into your steak before leaving the restaurant.   Now here's where I get specific to this new location in Happy Valley. The host staff was very polite. Oh yeah, they don't have a take out stand or take out parking. Good luck not only finding parking but then standing the the middle of the chaotic restaurant at the host stand to get your food. The girl cashed me out & went over all my food making sure my order was correct. I asked \"can I cut into that?\" & the hostess, who this is probably her first job ever, looked very confused & asked \"what?\" I said \"can I cut into the steak to make sure it's cooked well done?\" She politely says yes & goes to get me a knife. She brings me A PLASTIC SET OF SILVERWARE!  To amuse her & not make her look like an idiot I smiled & attempted to cut into my steak. Of course it didn't work. So I asked for a real knife. She got one & not to my surprise my steak was very red. Not pink. Red. When it should have been well done. She sent it back to the kitchen and the manager came out & apologized. I informed her that the reason I asked to cut into the steak is because this happens LITERALLY every single time I order my food. She got my food cooked & I cut into it.. Finally cooked well done. Or so I thought. I get home.. To which my PLAIN mashed potato side is drenched in butter & now cold.. & as I start to eat my steak the back end is still red. Again, not pink, but red. I'm so incredibly frustrated with Texas & their cooking staff. I don't know if it's the rush of trying to get the order to go or what the issue is, but I send my steak back every time. I always tip my take out girls because I know they work hard but seriously to come home.. After sending your steak back once already.. & have to cook it myself again in the microwave is NOT what I call good customer service. The only reason I continue to eat at Texas is because of the amount of food for your money & it's good when trying to stay on the healthy side. I'm very disappointed with this new location. I was excited because it's closer to home. But this seems to be a common theme amongst the chain of restaurants. I could go into further detail about the Arrowhead location & how absolutely unprofessional their staff is, using profanity in front of customers, complaining about their schedules & being on their phones instead of getting my food.. But that's a whole different review. Overall I am not please with the Happy Valley location & I'm not sure how much longer Texas will be my favorite go to place."}
{"text":"I just had the pleasure of having dinner with my family at the Texas Roadhouse. And from the call ahead reservation to our wonderful waiter Tim the whole experience was great. Really good steaks and salads and entertainment to Boot. Great value and good quality. I will definitely be back and make it one of my go to haunts"}
{"text":"Wow, this place may have one up on Starbucks as their customer service rocks! As a family we eat out very often and I can tell you that this evening was one of the best dining experiences we have had in probably YEARS. So impressed that we were compelled to write this review. Everything was perfect...the food came out super quick and was uber delicious. The service was impeccable. Our server was Shelly Mac and to all the management at TR.....she deserves a raise! She was beyond awesome with a wonderful customer service personality, really made our night (Thank you Shelly Mac!). At least 4 different employees made direct eye contact and smiled at us with \"Have a great night\" when we left and even packed us up some peanuts for the kiddos to go... Very usual to be greeted at the door but not so usual to be treated well at the exit! Thank you Texas Roadhouse and Shelly Mac for a great family outing!"}
{"text":"Generally this restaurant is really good with service and food but today they dropped the ball. Was seated with my wife, we waited for someone to get our drink order.... and waited and waited.... After 15 minutes of watching wait staff zoom around us to other tables, we left. Sadly we will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had a craving for steak and we were in the area so he decided to drag me here. We walked in and were ignored until one of the host pushed another girl to greet us. For people who had \"I Heart My Job\" shirts on, they sure were unpleasant. We had no idea if she just drop us off at the table and went back to moping in the front, or if she actually notified someone of our presence. Our server was nice, and the food was alright. The manager gave us a complimentary bag of peanuts even though we asked to have our peanut bucket taken off the table, but whatevs. I guess it's the thought that counts. All in all, meh. They get a thumbs down."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place doesn't have better reviews on Yelp. We come here at least several times a month, usually Friday or Saturday during the busy time. Call ahead to avoid the lines. Always get fried pickles with extra ranch for an appetizer, the best fried pickles around and we love fried pickles! Service is usually a B+ but understandable given how busy they are. We come for the delicious food though. Favorites are the sirloin with sweet potato and Cesar salad. Yum! We are planning on returning tomorrow."}
{"text":"Jack was great!  We ordered a large party catering order on fairly short notice, 10 people. Everything was delicious portions were generous. I would highly recommend this place to anyone normally we eat there often but this was first time doing the large take out and we were very impressed."}
{"text":"The other night we took our kids out to dinner, we don't often do this as they are only 4 and 6 years old. We had a very enjoyable time and our server, Bailey, went above and beyond for us. She was great with the kids and made it fun for all."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! We had prime rib which was seasoned perfectly and grilled to perfection. Our server, Johnathan was very attentive and kept our drinks filled. We would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Usually, fantastic value and great tasting steaks.  Last night, medium prime rib came out medium well (we made it known but didn't ask to send it back). Usually, the server gets a manager anyway knowing the customer isn't 100% satisfied.  Our server was either new or just didn't care because she didn't know answers to most of our questions (steak sizes, drinks on tap, etc).  Maybe it was a management issue because we had our Great Envelope prizes opened for us and our server came back and said we couldn't use any of them on this trip (a couple of to-go desserts).  Point to management - make sure everyone is on the same page.   Will still visit as often as we do."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite dinner out in Meridian. My wife gets the fall off the bone ribs and I usually get the sirloin or the ribeye. The food is excellent and the sides are awesome. I go for the standard salad and baked potato but there is also the fries or vegetables, not a fan of the chili but thats a personal taste probably I've had the 1/2 chicken as well and it is good (not great but good)"}
{"text":"Just ate here last night - Our 3rd or 4th time. I had the choice sirloin and my wife had the portobello mushroom chicken - both of us loved our meals. Our server, Taylor, was very nice. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Your typical casual dining chain, but with a country theme.  The food is just OK, nothing more.  The service isn't anything to write home about and usually involves at least one screw-up per visit. Last time I went here my waitress was about as intelligent as a head of cabbage, which seems to be par for the course at this establishment.  The prices are fairly low in keeping with the quality of the food and service.  I give three stars instead of two because of the warm rolls and cinnamon butter they give you as soon as you sit down.  So bad for you yet so, so good.  Really, the rolls and butter are the only reason to go here."}
{"text":"Wonderful green beans. 99% of the time we get great service.  Good steak. Not too expensive.  We go here almost once a week."}
{"text":"Called for reservations, was notified they do not have reservations, just have call ahead up to one hour ahead.  Thought it would be an issue but there was nothing to it!!! The music was said to be loud but I didn't notice it being too loud at all.  There is line dancing by the employees in the middle of the restaurant too.  The best service I have received in a very long time.  Definitely worth my while being the last place I was going to eat before going back overseas to finish my tour of duty.  The meL was just the best ever. The ribs are all that they say they are. I look forward to coming back in a year when I get back to the states."}
{"text":"Young waitresses, bartenders, and waiters are up to speed and good.  A little noisy on busy nights.  Excellent food and plenty of it at a very reasonable cost. I'll try calling ahead for no seasoning on my steak.  Lightly seasoned and tasty, but I like no seasoning.  Another steakhouse chain puts too much seasoning on their meat.  Makes me wonder about the poor cow the meat came from, or what is being covered up. Out of Blue Moon beer, hubby's favorite."}
{"text":"I for one would say everything fell together perfectly for dinner at this local establishment. There was a ten minute wait which they handed me a pager for and we sat in the car till it went off. About 6 minutes.  The peanut shell covered floor is great and all of a sudden the servers are in a line clapping and dancing! I ordered the steak and ribs combo with baked potato and we'll it tasted like steak and potato. I was satisfied in the end. I would recommend going here because the service, atmosphere, and food were all great."}
{"text":"Very good ^^ loved their bread and steaks. Recommend their Bone-in Ribeye median cooked :). Service is good too!"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices... it's a known quantity. Yeah it can be loud and crowded, which isn't what you want for every meal, but when you're in the mood it can be a fun place.  If the wait is long, try sitting on the small patio for dining. It's a great option for locals who don't consider 101 degrees to be \"Hot\"."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss. The food and service were great the first few times we went. Past two experiences have been annoying to say the least. When you order a rare steak you don't expect to get it well /md well done. Not sure if we will go back, but if so I hope it better than our last experience."}
{"text":"On second visit the time it took for the food to come out was much shorter. Again, amazing service. They also dance about every 1/2 hour which is cute. This time I had the pulled pork sandwich and I can't even explain its deliciousness!  I think they used their homemade bread recipe for the grilled bun. Yum!  Again, no option to just have the pork without BBQ sauce, but since it was baked right into the meat, it was ok and amazing. I would like to see a dry option in the future though for those of us that prefer to taste just meat. Will definitely return, and highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's a hit or miss here. They never can seem to cook my steak to a perfect medium they always over cook it. They offer me another steak but the problem is when you have kids and are on a time schedule. As everyone knows,  the rolls are amazing here."}
{"text":"after reading the other reviews, i can't add much.  good yet not outstanding food, pricey beers, dancing servers, peanuts on the floor...   woo hoo, we're having fun now!  on the bright side, portions were large, we took home leftovers, and probably will return due to a lack choices.  i think i'll try the Great Impasta again to get that local owner greeting their guests feel.  i hope i find it when i visit."}
{"text":"Check order if you do takeout.  Missing some of our food and didn't want to drive all the way back to get it."}
{"text":"We frequent Texas Roadhouse quite often, and tell friends it is one of the few places we always get great service, good food at a great value.  Until last night I cannot remember having a bad experience. We did call ahead as usual, and were told 30-45 minute wait, and we were  20 minutes out. When we arrived and checked in, we were told the same time. We waited at the bar for over an hour. At an hour fifteen, I went to the desk, and they said they texted us, but I had no text.... We were seated, and things were very normal until we got our dinner after about 30 minutes. We never got our salads..... We asked why the dinner came before the salads, and the waitress went to find out, and the did come about ten minutes later. Our son, who is a chef, and reluctantly goes to ANY chain, has always looked TR. he ordered a rare steak, that came looking like it was thrown on a hot frying pan for a few seconds and turned. There were absolutely no grill marks at all on the very gray colored steak. It was also ice cold. We don't usually complain, but spouses prime rib was cold also, and his was we'll done. My meal was fine with no complaints. The best part of the story was the young male manager who really wanted to make it right. We didn't want new food, as we had been there two hours, and my son was taking the steak home to his pup, he didn't want a credit, we just wanted them to know. Our bill came with a twenty dollar credit, which was very nice of them to do. We will of course go back, we have been going for as long as they have been in Charlotte, thanks for the excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"We went there today for the first time. Server was very attentive and kept up with our drinks etc.. I got the Portobello Mushroom Chicken and sweet potato and veggies. Everything was delicious. Peanuts were great!  The reason I gave it a 4 was table was not ready when we got there. My son called ahead. And it was a bit noisy for us but everything was yummy."}
{"text":"The service & the food on this visit was AWESOME!  The only negative was how loud it was when the servers gathered 'round and hooped & hollered for the occasional celebration. Our server Tiki was very attentive & pleasant. We'll be asking to be set at her table next time we visit. We had refills on the table before we needed them & she even brought a kids refill for our little one - can't remember the last time that happened, oh wait - that's never happened with out asking. Definitely deserving of the bigger than normal tip we left. The food was prepared to perfection. The steaks were cooked just right - one medium & one medium rare, the cook definitely knows the difference & it shows. The kids sliders were really good too - the little one ate both of them!"}
{"text":"have always been happy with the food except for today, the beef tips were very very tough and tasted old, the gravy/sauce was so salty could not eat, in a time crunch so could not wait for another dinner."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a couple times in the past, the place is always packed but expected. Went last night and that will be the LAST time we go to this location. The waitress along with the manager were extremely rude. Our waitress literally had her back to us the whole time, wouldn't look our way when she was serving the tables around us. The time she did was to drop the check off right after our food was brought to us. While eating she comes back again to check if the money was in the little book, mind you we JUST got our food. She then starts talking to us about how busy she is and how she hopes more waitresses are hired because the snowbirds are coming and then leaves. My husband had to get up twice to find someone to refill our drink and bring us steak sauce and the times she was around our area we would call for her and she wouldn't turn around. She came by a total of 4 times to the table next to us and didn't turn around once. We were pretty shocked so after paying we politely addressed our issue to the manager who proceeded to tell us that this waitress was already \"on her list\" and she apologized and kept asking \"well what do u want me to do?\" we left and we will never return to this location again."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need a steak.  Tonight was one of those times.  I ordered the sirloin with grilled shrimp.  Sirloin is tricky because it's so lean, but they cooked it to a perfect medium and it still had plenty of juice.  The grilled shrimp were amazing and were slathered in garlic butter.  The meal came with two sides, I chose a bowl of chili and a loaded baked potato.  The chili was in the Texas style, spicy and without beans, and was a good starter.  The loaded baked potato was good (kudos for the crusting of kosher salt on the skin) but I was too full from the rest of the food to finish it.  The staff was very nice and on top of things."}
{"text":"We called ahead for seating and only had a 10 minute wait on a busy night. Good service fast delivery of food items. Meat lacked flavor and was over cooked."}
{"text":"excellent place. One of our favorite places to eat. The staff is great and friendly and helpful. Always do a call ahead so you don't have a wait or a very long wait at all. The warm rolls and honey butter is to die for. WE love the steak and ribs that they serve. Have never had a major issue and when we did have an issue the manager too take of it."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I am not a steak eater. I went here because my fiancé talked me into it. The grilled chicken was really good but the Caesar salad was really salty and the rolls that come with each dinner were oddly sweet, even without adding the cinnamon butter that they serve with it. Our server took my plate before I was finished with it. I would not go back unless I'm forced to compromise again!"}
{"text":"Okay, so as far as steak houses goes, Texas Roadhouse is at the BOTTOM of my list. On the plus side: The shrimp was pretty good, and their bread was great. That's it. The chicken tenders were about the same quality as Chilies. And their Country Fried chicken and gravy was just low grade. And if you go anyway DO NOT GET THE RICE!! It taste like your just eating sodium. Nasty nasty sodium. As my husband put it \"I can taste the box!\"  So yes if your going to choose a stake house for dinner just go to a real steak house. YOu will pay a $3.00 difference for MUCH BETTER FOOD.  Outback, Lonestar, Long Horn. All much MUCH better"}
{"text":"Great steak.......awful service, unless you don't mind getting your salad AFTER your meal"}
{"text":"Place gets extremely loud, but what do you expect at Texas Roadhouse. The food is generally better than your typical run of the mill city steakhouse. Their rolls/cinnamon butter has to be one of the best in the city. You can never go wrong with their baby back ribs, prime rib or rib eye steak."}
{"text":"I love this place definitely one of my favorite places. I'm not sure if they are the managers but some guy and girl walk around making sure how everything is going and they are just so nice! Ps. If it's your first time they may give you a free appetizer ticket for the next time you come back!"}
{"text":"This place kills it!!!!!!. The food is over the top flavorful. Our service was fast, food was hot, it Did not have that \"I've been sitting under a warmer for 30 min\" texture! Seriously Destiny is great, what a place for a great dinner."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain! But you can never go wrong! Always great food, and the servers are spot on!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this branch since it was close to our area.  Went there to watch the Cardinals game last night.  We followed an employee going inside from the reception thinking we were being led to our table only to find out we weren't (or so we thought). Realizing this mistake, another server politely led u to a table but we wanted to be able to watch the game so we were lucky to eventually get a table @ the bar. (They even wanted us to go back to reception area to let them know we wanted close to the TV's when there was another table being cleaned up). I whispered to the server that it was my daughter's birthday & she said \"got it.\" My 10-year old daughter was really excited to be \"greeted by the staff\" & waited & waited...until we left the restaurant with NO BIRTHDAY GREETINGS:(.  So as I was leaving I told the server she forgot the birthday greeting.  She said sorry but too late:(. My daughter was already disappointed. We're better off going back to the branch @ 75th Ave. - employees over there are pay attention to their customers & they look like they're having more fun while dancing.  The food was the same but customer service makes a big difference.  The Cardinals lost & my daughter was disappointed on her birthday-\"TOO MANY BAD MEMORIES.\""}
{"text":"After a bit of a saddening time at a different Texas Roadhouse a few years ago, I was VERY delighted at this place! Anthony was spectacular, making sure everything was right for all of us, and even giving my party a free app for next time!  And the food, at least from the last time I have gone, was an improvement. My 8oz sirloin was delightfully juicy and cooked just right, with a cold and flavorful Caesar preceding it. The fries were a bit of a low point with too much seasoning(?) and being a bit overcooked, but I was too happy with the rest to mind.   Would gladly come back to this TXR next time I'm craving a steak!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Texas roadhouse near metrocenter mall and the food was delicious and the atmosphere was great! Due to convenience I went to this location.. I wasn't impressed. The food was good and service was okay.. what brings my review down to one star is the cleanliness of this place. I looked around and saw a layer of dust on all the lamps.. also on the tops of the booths. I could run my fingers along the edge of the booth and get a thick layer of dust on my finger. It was disgusting! It made me hesitate to even finish the food thinking if the dining area was this unkept, imagine the kitchen! I since have returned to the metrocenter location and looked at the lighting fixtures and booths and didn't see or feel any dust. I will only be dining at the metrocenter location from now on.."}
{"text":"We've tried this location a few times and it always seems to be the same experience. It takes a long time to get anything to the table..cocktails, entrees. When it arrives it's not hot and fresh. My ribs were cold in the middle but it had already been over 40min , I just took them to go.Disappointment . For the money I'd rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My dad and I make it to Texas Roadhouse at least once a month just to eat their fresh rolls with cinnamon butter.  Everyone is on a budget these days and the food is a super bargain!  I've had the ribs, steak, and prime rib and they have all tasted great.  I know it's a chain restaurant and all, but the food and prices make it worthy of a visit."}
{"text":"Good food is hard to find sometimes. I always appreciate the consistency of Texas Roadhouse. When I come here I come to have a good steak. I love the addition of shrimp. Who doesn't right?! Today we were here when the doors opened. We were sat immediately, which was good because the buns were calling my name! We got sat by the kitchen, wanted a little  less action so asked to be sat somewhere with less action. Back to the front we went, taken to the table right in front of the dancing line. Hmmm, not quite what we had in mind but somewhat satisfied. Ideally, less action would have been towards the back. Must have got mixed in translation. But since buns were in her hand we sat and shut up about it."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy going to Texas Roadhouse and I've been to several in different cities but this one had the worst service of any I've ever visited.  We were in Tempe for a little mini vacation this last weekend and before we headed home we stopped in at this location figuring it was a safe and good bet. We were seated by a hostess who offered us appetizers but then wasn't interested in answering any questions. She seemed to be in a rush to go back to hanging out by the front door and told us our server would be with us shortly. We were left with cool rolls that had clearly been sitting for a while.  20 minutes later no one had stopped by our table and we felt we had waited long enough so we complained to a different hostess who was manning the hostess station. Apparently our first hostess had sat us at a table that wasn't being served at the time but she indicated that they'd be happy to seat us correctly at that point. Since we had to get on the road and we had seen the staff goofing off and not really having an interest in paying much attention to customers while we were waiting we declined and asked to make a complaint to the manager.   We were told that the manager wasn't available and all we could do was walk out and stop at a random drive through to grab a quick burger as we headed out of town.   All things considered we won't be stopping by at this Texas Roadhouse if we're ever in town again. It was a really disappointment and I would strongly recommend against stopping by this place. They had extremely poor service and really don't live up to the Texas Roadhouse name."}
{"text":"Omg Tyler the server is the BOMB! He took very good care of us..... Great kid! Next time we go there I will certainly ask to sit in his section!"}
{"text":"Love their bone-in rib eye. Juicy and flavorful.  Best steak! Taste even better if you top it with grilled onions and mushrooms. $1 happy hour margarita.  Woo hoo.  Not the best place to go if you want to have a quiet meal though. Also I feel kinda overwhelmed as the staff come over and ask me how is everything every few minutes when I have a mouthful of meat!"}
{"text":"We've only been to Texas Roadhouse twice since it opened.  The food was good, Parking could be \"difficult\" (Movie theaters in the area) but the background Music was way too Loud."}
{"text":"Well my son and daughter in law took my wife and I out for fathers day dinner to the Texas Roadhouse on Bullard and McDowell Road and I have to say it was the worst meal and service I have had in 10 years, no kidding. I think someone literally dumped the salt shaker on my potato and Bar-B-Que chicken and people who got there after us were done eating by the time we got our food. And my poor daughter in law just ordered a dinner salad and got that 10 minutes after we got our food. Horrible experience but thanks to my son and daughter in law for a memorable evening. Not good for Texas Roadhouse. At least 15 minutes just to take our drink order and another 10 minutes to get the drinks. All in all it took an hour and a half to get out meal delivered. There is really no excuse for this type of eating experience, especially when we normally love TR at the 75th Ave and Bell Road locations. You got a lot of work to do folks."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since the place opened.  They have the best steak I can find in the Phoenix Metro area.  If the price were a little cheaper I would probably eat here more.  That is not to say they are over priced as you get a good deal for your money.  I've had almost everything on the menu, even the fried pickles, and it is all good.  The employees are courteous (and attractive) and the service is fast.  If you come later in the evening, especially Friday to Sunday, you could have to wait up to an hour but it is worth it."}
{"text":"The place was very busy for a Thursday, but we had a table within a few minutes.  Our server was very prompt and attentive, and the drinks and food were well paced.  Their margaritas are very good for a chain. The food was also quite  good, with the steaks done medium rare properly and the sides were tasty.  My pulled pork was a huge serving and was moist but not too greasy.  The rolls were good but did not seem fabulous as others claim (warm and fresh, but a bit too greasy on the outside).  Overall a great non fuss dinner out for a reasonable cost."}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner with some family and we always come to this place so I thought I would check in to it once and give it my review. To start, we got seated after about five minutes for a party of four, so it was pretty fast knowing it was Friday night. The inside of this place is very country like and has a cool country vibe. The service is really good here and there is always many waiters/waitresses on staff. I ordered lemonade but they said they were out of lemonade which I thought was pretty bizarre but I was looking forward towards the meal. I got a steak with a baked Potato and Chile. The chile was alright but the baked potato and steak were very good. This is a great place to go if you are trying to come here for a family dinner or a birthday dinner. I really enjoy this place and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"The food was horrid and three of us were ill the rest of the week. The service was exceptionally slow."}
{"text":"Love it. Great food. Long wait til you get seated. Call ahead"}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night for my girlfriend's birthday and the food was excellent. My girlfriend had the steak and shrimp combo, her sister had a steak and all the fixins, I had a 10oz sirloin and steak fries. The server, Maria was excellent and made sure we wanted for nothing!!! I would and will highly recommend this restaurant to all of my relatives and friends!!!  Food and service are great!!!"}
{"text":"Their service is great, the food is delicious.   But the music an tv's are so loud, it is not relaxing.  They should have more areas where you can have a peaceful dinner!!!!  Service is also excellent."}
{"text":"On 08/31/13..I myself, my companion and daughter visited this location, was greeted pleasantly, and assigned a table. There were two buckets of peanut on the table, some yeast rolls w/ the cinnamon butter. Upon Dan (waiter) getting our drinks and asking if we were ready to order I looked to pickup my menu and noticed a MAGGOT ON THE TABLE..thats correct: A maggot. I swiped it away, Dan apologized, gave us a moment, then returned and apologized again w/ the offer of speaking with the manager. The manager apologized said it was most likely from the peanuts & offered free dinner on next visit. Needless to say we left immediately & WILL NOT be returning. ( if maggots are in the building/peanuts: NO THANK YOU)"}
{"text":"Terrible place to work for I just heard a story of them find a girl over her biological father coming in there who she hadn't seen in 11 years she said hi to him which upset his wife and they left she finished the rest of her day working fine the next day when she went into work they fired over that situation. I for one and boycotting Texas Roadhouse because any place that could be that cruel to their staff does not deserve my business... Yelp wants me to give them a star but I don't believe they deserve it"}
{"text":"I have been to this particular Texas Roadhouse 3 times and have never been disappointed. Last night, 5/3/14, I ordered the ribeye steak and ribs, with mashed potatoes and corn as sides. The steak was cooked medium well as ordered, well seasoned and tender. The ribs were tender and came off the bone easily. Not to crazy about BBQ sauce on the ribs, but I'm not a sauce person. The sides were also delicious. Our waitress was very nice and gave very good service. The pre dinner rolls were warm and light, and came with delicious cinnamon butter. We also ordered a onion blossom which was ok, but not as good as Outback steakhouses'."}
{"text":"Fabulous team and manager that was on duty Tuesday, Sept 1st!  We had an emergency and had to leave just after our order was place- the manager came over said to go don't worry about the drinks that we said we would pay for.  I have told so many people this story, they were so compassionate and caring they were not concerned about our drinks we were already enjoying.  Thank you so much - we promise we will be back to enjoy a meal there and so will many others as I continue to tell this story!!!"}
{"text":"Really didn't expect to like this joint. What REALLY impressed me about the Madison, WI location (we tried Wausau first), was that they did NO advertising. I mean zero, zip, no TV, no radio, no newsprint...wow...ballsy! But I noticed that from the time they opened, the parking lot was ALWAYS full! Finally went in there (3 times now)- the food is consistently very good, service was excellent, portions were generous. In Wausau they greeted us with a free bag of their own brand of peanuts- doesn't seem like a big deal, but it won me over and I thought it was a clever way to keep es thinking about them! The prices seem a little high when you order, but once you see the portions, you feel foolish-the portions are VERY generous! I hope they will be around for many, many years! Can't wait to go back-and I very rarely say that."}
{"text":"I've been to several TRHs a few times with my family, and for a chain, it's not bad.  Not great, but not bad.  The steaks have always been competently done, as well as the shrimp I usually get with them.  I enjoy the fried pickles way more than they deserve considering the health benefits.  They are also the only meat-oriented restaurant I know of that serves a few genuine options for vegetarians, an important consideration for my family.  The bigger problem is with the service, something a chain usually does better. Table service is friendly, but always rushed.  I understand they are busy, but I don't like being considered an annoyance by my server.  The front staff at the Gilbert store is particularly unpleasant, it appears they hire only \"mean girls\" for the desk.  They will not even acknowledge your presence until they finish their conversation (work-related or not), and if you are not a good-looking young man, you get at best indifferent and often downright rude treatment.  Don't ever let them sit you in the bar area.  Those tables are waited by the bar staff, who also have to tend bar, and usually don't have time to do either.  You won't enjoy your dinner if you are seated there.  If you ever get it.  If we have a big group and are looking for something easy and affordable we will wind up at THR.  As long as you know what your are getting, it's fine."}
{"text":"Great value for the money.  Reasonably priced with some great options.  Service is attentive and atmosphere is casual.   Great place for kids.   The bread is fantastic.   One of the best places in the area for steak."}
{"text":"We ate at texas roadhouse for dinner last night. Our server was a young man with a great friendly personality wish I had gotten his name. We truly enjoyed him. I ordered the prime rib and it was super tough I told him this and he took care of it promptly also sent the manager over. We  ordered a steak instead which came out with two more sides it was excellent. My party of four really  enjoyed our meal and appreciated the swift fix of mistakes.."}
{"text":"Great experience! This was our first time here at Texas Roadhouse and we were unfamiliar with the menu. Our server, Jessie was very helpful and ensured that we were pleased with our order.  My husband and I both got the ribeye steak. I ordered a side of catfish. We sampled the loaded tater tots and got sides of mashed potatoes.   Good food! Fun ambience!"}
{"text":"They have great, fall off the bone, ribs.  The food is tremendous.  Although it is too loud for conversations at the tables.  But, I go there to eat, not chit-chat."}
{"text":"Absolutely love coming here! Every single birthday celebration takes place at this location. Great service every time and we have been coming here for years. Tonight was exceptionally well. Brett was by far the best server we have ever had. Our immediate family is very large and we always have to sit at two separate tables. He coordinated the service amazingly, put forth the effort to ensure our orders were taken at the same time, that food came out together and that is something that has never been done for us. He had a great attitude, constantly checking to see if we need anything and not once did we have to ask for a refill. One of the best customer service experiences we have ever had. Needless to say, we will be requesting Brett from now on!"}
{"text":"We have been here numerous  times and had a good dining experience.  Tonight was perhaps an anomaly.  We always try and sit at bar to get faster service.  So we sat down and waited,  waited, waited for the bartender to greet us and ask what  we wanted to drink. The bartender was busy talking to another coworker with her back.to the bar. The conversation went on and on. I waved at her coworker to get the bartender attention. The bartender turned around and waves back and went back to her conversation. She came over after she figured I been put in my place.  The flatware that I got the.steak knife was sorry I tried to clean with.my napkin but the food particles  were baked on.  I asked for another knife and it was as dirty as the first one   I ended up cleaning with a wet napkin.  The food arrived and problems.  The ranch dressing was so thick that it pound in clumps  and the prime rib was extremely dry.    Maybe it was an off night for restaurant but  it ruined our dinner and movie night"}
{"text":"DON'T go here with a large group or before a movie. We had tickets for a group of 12 for a 7:45 movie and figured Texas Roadhouse would be just the place for dinner before the movie. Well the hostess staff was pretty difficult about even taking a call ahead for a party of 12. We told everyone to be there at 6 and luckily a couple people in our party were there at 5:45 but the hostess staff still gave us a hard time! We were shocked! It was like they didn't even want our business! I get that they're busy but you'd think they would want to take care of large groups of people. We weren't seated until nearly 6:30 so that made making our movie much tighter than it should be having showed up at 6!   Thankfully our server Tim was on top of it all and we did make the movie - he kept the rolls flowing and brought our bills before our meals arrived so kudos to him!  Sadly, due to the difficult hostess staff (and potential policies from management?) I will DEFINITELY not be back anytime I have a party larger than 2 or 4 or anytime I'm on a time crunch. If you're looking for a place to go before a movie try Mellow Mushroom, Charleston's, or Red Robin. All in close proximity and much friendlier about accommodating groups. We heard you loud and clear Texas Roadhouse, we won't take our group there again!"}
{"text":"food was okay but server was the worst. area i sat in was by the service station at the back of the rest. server would not come by me to take order. could not hear her and told her so several times. finally i was able to get my order to her. food was served from far end of table for 6 and had to be handed from guest to guest. only time we saw her next was when she brought the bill. no how is ur meal or do u need a refill. at he next table the person setting the table was tossing dishes as if she was playing cards adding to the noise coming from the work station. leaving a tip is my choice but no change was brought back to the table nor was the recept.  both couples come to this location many times and we both agreed the server had no business working at t.rh.  we were very disappointed.  i would have given you the information that is usally in the recept but as i mentioned no change and recept was brought to the table.  our table bought approximately 100 dollars worth of food. very dissapointed"}
{"text":"Where do I start!! From the dirty silverware, to the over salted food!!!  We have been to this exact establishment several times feeling too full yet happy. Tonight was not the same. From the dirty forks to the nasty bathroom, that says a lot!  Hubs ordered prime rib m/r, was over cooked and ALL fat!!! I ordered the country veg (all sides). Did someone spill like 100 gals of salt in all your food? Almost everything was inedible!! Too much sodium!!!! Are you trying to kill your customers on the spot?!!!  With the food quality and the service, we will save our $80 and eat somewhere else. I can't see this chain lasting less than 5 more years. Food is half *ss, and service is if that if any!! Last time my money enters your establishment!!"}
{"text":"Morgan was mediocre. She dropped a cup of water on my lap, which would have been okay if that was it. My buddies 25$$ steak came out over cooked, dry, and not the steak he ordered. Also when they brought the steak out again there was no toppings like he ordered on the first one he ordered. It was given after the other two  finished their food, ruining his appetite.... Despite this, the steaks were excellent and the beer was fresh."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN, will I step foot in this location. Management is rude and unprofessional. Manager Bert is a rude, egotistical, jerk! As we were in the process of following the hostess, a female manager walked threw her hands in our face to stop, and sent the hostess away to go dance. The manager turned her back to us, and we were left standing clueless as to what we needed to do. When we approached her to let her know how rude the service was, Bert, the unprofessional manager stepped in. Not once did he apologize, he made a ton of excuses, and started YELLING at us. How embarrassing!!!!!  By that time, we were furious, and walked out. I called back to get the manager's name. Once again, Bert stepped in (that's how we got his name), and started screaming at us. He said he would never apologize, because \"that's not the Texas Roadhouse way.\" Not once did he offer a solution, and said there was no point in calling corporate, because he would get the complaint, and he \"just didn't care\". What kind of manager is this? I'm appalled at the stupidity of whoever put this animal in charge! He ought to be fired. I'm scared to think what would happen to customers who have a problem once having been seated!   Service is big to me, and a shame that one jerk could ruin this entire company for our family."}
{"text":"My fillet medallions were great. My wife had the fillet salad, had to take it back, was raw and fatty and several different cuts of meat even though she ordered it med-rare. Took extra 20 min. Had to ask manager to take something off the bill... Hate having to do his job...."}
{"text":"I went here with my father for my birthday. The waitress stuck us in a back corner booth away from everything, and seemed to ignore us.  The waitress was the only one who sang the birthday song, nobody else came out like they did for people on the other side of the restaurant. I got free ice cream, which was soup by the time it was brought to the table and was not edible.  The meal was good, but the service was lousy. It seemed like the waitress wanted to seat us far away and not bother with us."}
{"text":"Gotta have my frozen margarita each time I come here! All food is great!! BBQ ribss yummmm! Great place!!"}
{"text":"what a negative experience!  went there for my birthday dinner with my family... my steak was way under done, and then they refired my steak til it was completely dry... I can handle a bad food experience, but the manager's (Abby was her name according by my server) reaction \"sealed the deal\"... she acted \"put out\" that there was an issue, and then did the absolute bare minimum by taking my steak off the check... she knew it was my birthday dinner and no effort was made to redeem this experience... I don't think I would go back.  additionally, my son's steak was over done and dry, but we didn't send it back cause he was \"starving\"... and one potato was literally the smallest I've ever seen in a Texas roadhouse while the other was a good size... we eat at the Texas roadhouse in Erie regularly, and always feel like a valued guest... not the case in Mccandless... I can handle a dinner error, but the management response was truly baffling... I'll choose to eat where we are treated like valued guests and not just a check.  they may be busy now because they are new... I predict this does not remain the norm."}
{"text":"We used to go here often when we lived in Gilbert until 2010. I was hoping things were the same and I was not disappointed. We had a party of 6 last Saturday at 5pm, a very busy time for this place. The wait was only 30 minutes, even though there was a line and the place was packed. The free peanuts kept us happy until we got to our table. Everyone greets you as they pass. Our waitress was very friendly, but not overbearing. The drinks came out fast, the yummy rolls kept coming, and the food was hot and delish! My ribeye was a perfect medium. It was a great meal at a great price. The manager came by twice during the meal, once to check on how we liked everything. The second time he brought a bag of peanuts and a coupon for the newcomers at the table to share. I was the only one who had been there before. Someone remarked that we were travelling in 3 different cars, so he brought back two more containers of peanuts for us! It's a bit loud here, but but has a fun atmosphere and good country music playing. They have great early bird specials and it's less noisy in the afternoon. Definitely worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service! They were super busy for Father's Day. And, all of the employees made us feel welcome and comfortable. I'm not a big steak lover but there were plenty of things on the menu to choose from. Definitely recommend! Be sure to use the call ahead seating to shorten the wait time."}
{"text":"I'm honestly so disappointed in the quality of service at this Texas Roadhouse. Kevin, the General Manager, does NOT know what customer service means and the way he treats his employees in front of customers is absolutely appalling. They should really consider hiring a manager that promotes a good work environment. You're better off going to Gilbert or Mesa - you won't have to hear yelling, or \"employee discipline\" while trying to enjoy your meal that is over cooked and cold."}
{"text":"Very surprised that this place does not have a 5-star rating from everyone.  We come here about twice a month and with the exception of 1 time, have always had fantastic service from the staff and delicious food. The prices are extremely reasonable for the large amounts of food. I almost always bring home leftovers. Their rolls are the best though!  Other restaurants in the area should take notes from this Texas Roadhouse. Treat your staff well and they will treat your customers well.  It's apparent that this is the case here."}
{"text":"As a fan of this franchise, I was highly dissapointed in tonights experience. Please hire experienced waitstaff and bartenders. Really quite sad to not know the simple things, like what a chilled shot is. Especially when purchasing premium priced liquors. Manager questioned if I paid my tab after complaining mildly. Pure moronic experience. Just absurd  having this incredibly rude manager chase me down to ask if i paid my tab. Will be letting all my Norterra folks know to avoid this location."}
{"text":"My favorite fairly-priced steakhouse.  Rolls and cinnamon butter, salads, mashed potatoes and filet mignon are all fantastic.  Service is quick and pleasant.  Can't ask for much more, except maybe a seating area for larger parties, which they seem to have difficulty accommodating."}
{"text":"Took the whole family and had a great time and great food as well.  From the line dancing to riding on a saddle for birthdays, a very fun place even if country is not your thing!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here at 5pm on a Friday. Server was very attentive and our food came out at a good pace. We had the Filet Mignon with shrimp and Rib Eye bone in.  Everything cooked to perfection very tender and flavorful. Can't wait till next time."}
{"text":"In town for spring training. This place was a place we saw last night when we were leaving the near by sport chalet. We saw the line and we said we had to come back! Not too bad for a place that looks commercial on the outside! They have a refrigeration case with some really nice cuts of meat and they did not disappoint. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars was because they cooked my rib eye to about medium well instead of medium rare. Their onion blossom thing was as great as everyone else says!! Well worth the 20-30 minute wait"}
{"text":"This is our go to place when we want a good bite to eat. My husband loves to hand pick his ribeye. I am vegetarian, so I always get the salad, which is actually Wally good. I live the sweet potatoes. They are HUGE! The fresh made rolls with cinnamon butter are always my favorite. Great bar service and the FOH manager always pays a visit to each table to make sure their dining experience is always great."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate dinner at the Texas Roadhouse in Surprise, AZ on Grand Avenue on 7/17/16. The worse meal we both ever had. My wife ordered the sirloin steak and shrimp with two sides. The shrimp was cold and drenched in butter and seasonings, she couldn't even taste the shrimp. Did not finish. The steak was just warm, not hot. The side of vegetables were totally soft and soggy. Not edible. I ordered the grilled chicken mushroom sandwich that comes with mushrooms, melted jack cheese, lettuce and onion on a toasted bun with steak fries on the side. I asked just leave off the lettuce and onion. When my food came out I noticed something missing. The steak fries were not there. I asked and waitress told me they are behind on making fries.  What restaurant gets behind on fries?  After taking two bites of my sandwich I then noticed there were no mushrooms or cheese, just a piece of chicken and it was not on a toasted bun but a soggy one. At this point, I didn't even say anything. We just wanted to get out of there. And also, if watching your intake of salt, do not go to the Texas Roadhouse. Everything we had was loaded with salt. Actually, not healthy if one is not even watching their salt intake. If you want a good meal, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Big fan of the bread and butter, the entrees and atmosphere are also a bonus. Worth the money for special occasions."}
{"text":"Gota love Texas Roadhouse! The food is always great. The rolls are nice and soft baked fresh! Tonight I ordered the road kill it was great lots of mushrooms and smothered with cheese. The salad is always fresh I will keep going here over and over!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my family. I love Texas Roadhouse the rolls here were more dense then other Texas I have been too.  I had the bone in ribeye steak it was cooked perfect. The service was nothing to be excited about my water could not be kept full and after asking for more rolls two times I finally got them after my meal. But I will be back."}
{"text":"great food at a reasonable price....bartenders are fabulous"}
{"text":"Waitress was nice but not very attentive. To make matters worse, my steak was wrong and then undercooked. My moms chicken fried chicken steak was ok and my son's hot dog was average. The gravy that came with his mashed potatoes was so salty that he could not eat it. I would say that this place was average at best so try another restaurant nearby as this place is really loud and overpriced for the quality. We will not be back"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner My daughter asked for no bacon  On the loaded mash of course it came with bacon  The ribs came out cold and greasy  The BBQ chicken was tasty as well as my wife's steak So I can't recommend them this time but I will give them another try  What saved the experience was the service  Well done"}
{"text":"Good food and good service, I will definitely go back here again. I liked the bread and butter ALOT and the menu is huge!"}
{"text":"When I arrived it was busy but I could see many open tables.  The hostess told me the wait could be between 5 and 15 minutes but it could be longer, she really didn't know.  Really?  Its her job to predict the wait.  I left and went across the street.  I got a text my table is ready - it took less than 5 minutes, I didn't return.  The hostess is the first person meeting the customer, they need to have a clue what is happening."}
{"text":"The only good thing about the place was the peanuts. That was it. I was with two of my friends and all three of our meals were bad. They took 45 minutes to come out and they tasted bad. I would never try it again."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to this location for several years (don't ask me why) so we went last night. Wow we're we impressed. The food and service were well above average and of course Saturday nights all the restaurants in the area are packed...especially at 7PM. We won't wait so long to come back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we have eaten at countless Texas Roadhouse restaurants. This place is in a convenient location and just opened 3 months ago. It is obvious that the place just is not used to handling crowds and is still trying to learn to be a restaurant. Had to constantly ask staff for beverage refills ... My pet peeve. After almost 40 minutes our server arrived with our order .. One short, telling us they ran out of chicken. They just realized that when they went to deliver the order. The manager, Hilson, came out apologized, took a replacement order and delivered that swiftly.  They were quick to assume responsibility for the situation, comped the person for the inconvenience and gave them a voucher for another free new. What we did order was good. Will give them one more try. Too many other steak restaurants in the area where I know I can get a good meal and good service."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience at Texas Roadhouse with friends tonight! Our server Melissa was friendly and attentive, and everything was cooked as ordered and even though it was busy we got everything very fast. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place was great! My friend and I were the first customers in and there was a line of people waiting to serve us. They were fast and efficient but not pushy, which was nice. The food was very delicious..I ate way too much! I will definitely be back here...and soon."}
{"text":"We love Texas Roadhouse!  Go often!  The rolls with special butter \"to die for\".  We love the \"Road Kill\" $8.99 special before 5.  All the servers have been excellent.  The manager gal was rude to me and unhelpful when a mistake was made on our credit card.  Server used our visa on a larger table check by mistake. She tried to correct it but went thru the bank...large amount.  I called mgr next day...showed up on statement.  She would not correct it...they throw away  the evidence.  Da. I had no proof since waitress took bill error back.   Mgr gal had no compassion!  Their mistake ...not ours!   We will pay cash next time.  I would give a 5 star but manager gal ruined it for us.  Very bad..customer is  always right..but she would not take responsibility!"}
{"text":"I wish they would not douse the baked potato skin in pure salt. I like to eat it... I dont know, just not crazy about this place. Steaks are ok I guess."}
{"text":"We are longtime Outback customers but stopped going after they went so commercial with higher prices and lower quality food. We love the food at this restaurant but the mgmt needs to deal with the young wait staff. They can have a very matter of fact attitude that doesn't come across well to a customer. Also, the bathrooms at this location could definitely stand to be cleaned. There is about 2 inches of dust and grime around each stall and against the wall.   Steaks here are great but the service can definitely use some help."}
{"text":"Parking- there is plenty of parking on site.  Wait time - They don't take reservations so on a Friday and Saturday you can find yourself waiting between 30 mins to an 1 hour.   Staff - The staff is super friendly. They play country music and they do this little dance to pump up the customers.  Food - If you check in on yelp get a free appetizer with the purchase of two entrées. If you get hungry before you get your food they do provide peanuts and this delicious freshly baked bread with apple butter. The portions are pretty big so make sure to go hungry.  The one thing I did not like about Texas roadhouse is that if you sit at the bar and want to watch a certain game on tv they will not change the channel for you."}
{"text":"We go regularly.  Bread is awesome.  Food is great except the ribs have not been up to par lately.  I always used to order appetizer ribs but have had to change.  Servers are always friendly."}
{"text":"Possibly the busiest restaurant Ill ever wait to go. Almost an hour wait on Saturday and Friday night. Call ahead really helps cut the wait down. Do it.  After the wait you are greeted with warm dinner rolls with honey butter. I sometimes go just for this.  Steaks are very affordable and hav above average quality for the money. Last time I loaded up the potatos but seemed worthless for a scoop of sour cream and a sprinkle of cheese. Service is spotty at times but throwing peanuts on the floor will keep you busy."}
{"text":"Our 1st visit, we usually go to Black Angus, but my 5 year old insisted we try the place \"with the flags\". We were seated in the bar with fresh bread and cinnamon butter, amazing! Our server was Hailey, and she rocked! Promised us the fried pickles were great, as they were. I had the 10oz ribeye, PERFECTION! I had a side salad and loaded baked potato, Hailey made sure to ask if egg was ok on my salad, which was not, so I'm thrilled she asked before hand. My daughter had the Kraft mac n cheese. It was Kraft, no complaints, just kudos to the company for not charging $9 like they could, her kids meal was $3.99 with ask drink too! The manager stopped by the table to give us a bag of peanuts with a free appetizer for our next visit. Nice job Texas Roadhouse! Only thing I needed with my dinner was green onions or scallions, but it was still great!!"}
{"text":"Josh was an amazing waiter tonight! Hank him for all his hard work and dedication to make our eating experience great! We love he rolls and josh was so generous with them thanks josh your the best!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go. Did not get the correct sauces on my meal,nor the correct dressing for my salad. Food was not even warm.NOT happy! What is the point of takeout if I am told to come back so they can fix it? At least we have some barbecue sauce in the fridge to put on the plain meat.  Sure do wish I hadn't left a tip for to go."}
{"text":"Riley sucks and gives horrible service. Never eating here ever again. She was very ignorant and made my daughter cry."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to describe the lack of customer service.  It is horrible!  We went there with a party of 15.  They sat us at three different tables.  While our parents got their food quickly, our food came out 25 minutes after them and it was dry and cold!  We asked the server to take it off our bill and didn't even want it remade.  Not once did she apologize.  Fed up that all she did was take it off the bill, and handed us a bill for our drinks and our kids food without an apology, we asked to speak to a manager.  Expecting the manager to apologize and do SOMETHING, she did the opposite.  She argued with me about our wait time and told me excuses for their food quality and speed of service.  I know what to do with upset customers as I have worked in restaurants for years as a waitress, worked in a large chain retail store as the manager, and currently own my own business.  You always make the customer happy, you always apologize.  Especially in this situation where we waited over an hour for cold, dry, hard food.  Your east madison location desperately needs a complete overhaul with training and it is seriously lacking."}
{"text":"The host staff at this location is a JOKE. I called at 3:50 PM to call ahead for my party that would be there that evening, to which they told me \"call back at 4. That's when we open\" . Seriously? How unprofessional.  Why even answer the phone?   Every time I have been here they barely greet you, after telling them I am meeting a group there, they stare at you then tell you to look around yourself! They seat the guests, they should at least have an idea where the parties are sat and lead you in that direction. Then when leaving not one of the 5 hosts leaning against the counter can tear themselves away from their conversation to say \"have a nice night\" or even a simple \"bye\". The only thing that is keeping me from giving 1 star is the wait staff. They are always pleasant and nice. Now the managers just need to get their host staff on the same page."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite steakhouse in Gastonia. Food is always good and they are consistent with food, service and atmosphere. Fun place to go and have fun with family and friends. Austin has been our waiter a few times, he's a great waiter. He makes us laugh and feel welcomed each time we've had him.  Really all the employees there have always had great attitudes. We have never had any bad experiences with the staff."}
{"text":"We had a late dinner tonight to support Maggie's Fund. I would of requested to have a manage come over to see how our plates of food came out of the kitchen but our dinner out tonight was about Maggie. Two of the dinners we ordered tonight was the Chicken Critters, it was a hot mess. The pieces of chicken were just a blob of mess. The salad and sweet potato was very good."}
{"text":"Coming from Texas for a visit I was so pleased to see a Roadhouse run correctly. The great bread was brought and went with us to seating. We were asked had we been there before, the bar orders were brought timely and noticed by our server Kyle. \"The booze makes the profit\". Yet so many places don't emphasize that. Water, to-go boxes, and everything in between was exemplary service. Kyle checked on us often. Ask for him."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the steaks at Texas Roadhouse, but this one is the worst that I have ever been to!  The hostess was rude, the waitress was NOT friendly, the rolls came out slow and when we finally got them they were cold and tasted like they had been made a year ago!  I asked to speak with the manager and he finally came out and was a real New Yorker \"wise guy\".  I will never go to that restaurant again.  The manager should be fired!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for a late lunch on a Saturday and we were very impressed with the food, the service and the total \"feel\" of the restaurant.  Our server was very friendly, the freshly made yeast rolls were awesome.  Our steaks were perfect.  My wife is very picky and she even gives this place two thumbs up.  A great deal for the money."}
{"text":"This place has its moments where I love it and then it's just okay. I feel like my server can make or break my time here.   I love there chicken ceasar salad! It never disappoints me. The shrimp appetizer is always good but leaves me wanting more, since it's so small.   The Steaks are alright when they cook them the way you want but that doesn't always happen. There a bit off on consistency but my kids love this place. I love the country music and the loud ambience, it makes things fun! I had the Kenney chesney blue drink(can't remember the name) but it was yummy!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and Great food.  Would recommend to anyone.  The steak was done perfect, ribs were fall off the bone tasty."}
{"text":"Very friendly and courteous staff and great food! I think I would prefer regular butter with the rolls but that is just me.  The balloon guy was great! I got a Lazer Blaster hehehe. My daughter got a dog :-). Good food and great atmosphere. Great way to spend a Friday night!"}
{"text":"Food's OK and the prices are reasonable, but lining up in a cattle line waiting for a table really irks me.  The servers do that overly-friendly thing of plopping down at your table to take your order- if you're into that kind of thing, go ahead.  I can think of worse places to eat.  ***Updated- September 08 I had originally rated this place two stars. We gave this place another try on a slow late summer night and had a much better experience.  I had the BBQ pork/shrimp skewer- the shrimp was amazing!  My son ate the catfish, and essentially devoured it.  Service was waay better and we left fat and happy."}
{"text":"I want to say thank you to best experience we have ever had from a complete stranger, tonight we went out to celebrate my husband being declared cancer free as well as the house we have been in escrow with for 3 months closing. We sold our last house that we had raised our children in when my husband was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year, and we have been living like nomads waiting for our new home to close. Earlier we found out that Albert had been declared cancer free from on his last PET scan, and our home finally closed today. We went to Texas Roadhouse on Pebble Creek in Buckeye and when Lisa our server asked if we were celebrating anything I told her about our everything we were celebrating, she was so kind, she opened up about her own recent struggles with cancer.   During dinner she asked if Albert would go ride the bull, which he did with a bit of prodding, they announced he was riding the bull in celebration of being cancer free, I bawled the entire time. After the ride Lisa came back over and told us that one of the servers was covering our meal. She refused to even take a tip from us. This is the best place ever, they made this special night so much more so!"}
{"text":"We got a late start to a Friday night out dinner, and 3 restaurants including TH had 30 minute waits...we luckily found 2 seats at the bar and Jason the bartender must have read our starving and thirsty faces as he set us up immediately with cocktails and their amazing warm sweet bread.  Our food (chicken and ribs) were delicious and this is what I like so much about this bar...Jason re-filled my wine glass without even asking, like he read the look on my face it had been that kind of week!  So hope you get him when you hit this location, hard to find an intuitive bartender like that in this city anymore it seems!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I'd give it a 1-star for the service. But because the food was so darn good, it raised it to 3-stars.  I understand the place was super busy. I understand that things happen. But I DO NOT understand when the server spills a full soda on my daughter that we only get a half hearted \"Sorry\" and then had to wait for several minutes for her to return with a rag. We had wiped it all up with our napkins by then. And I'm not one to require handouts, but if my daughter--whom you've spilled a full soda on who is now sitting there in soaking wet clothes because of you--wants a refill on her \"special\" drink, by gosh give it to her instead of lecturing her about how the special drinks don't get refills. And for the record, we never got any other \"I'm sorry.\" from her, like she just wanted us to brush it under the rug and forget about it. Well, I'm sorry, but if I screw up and dump something on MY customer, I will apologize a hundred times and do whatever possible to make them comfortable again.  The drink spilling aside, once the food arrived it made up for our wet clothes. Steaks were good, sides were good, and my husband loved the ribs. We didn't see much of our server after the food was served. I often wondered if anyone saw much of their servers since I saw several (counted 7 at one time) just standing around chatting with each other.  By the time we were done, we quickly paid a reasonably priced bill (great price for such a good steak) and got out of what my daughter called the Texas Madhouse. I'm not sure if we will go again. It will HAVE to be the food that would draw us because it definitely won't be the service."}
{"text":"Just had another delicious steak here at the Texas Roadhouse Restaurant in Matthews, NC.  On Independence Blvd. (maybe Charlotte, NC ?)  My waitress was Linda ( long dark hair in ponytail with glasses) and she was excellent.  She had my steak on hold until I completed my salad as I requested.  She was prompt, courteous, and very attentive to any need I may have had.  I couldn't have asked for better food and service.  Manager stopped by table to check on me as well. I just wanted to give a shoutout to the restaurant and their dedicated employees!  Stop by for a great meal sometime to see for yourself."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food. Had a small hiccup with the food they addressed it immediately. Megan the manager even came over to make sure it was taken care of. Our server Hally R. was incredible. Attention to detail and customer service was amazing! And oh the apple pie topped it all off.  In addition Ashley K. Another server came by to check on us as well. Not only great food but caring for customers on a level not often seen in the restaurant service industry! Thank you again for an amazing experience and we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Hey ya'll this review'll wrap up my Phoenix weekend.     We drove go-karts, visited with friends and now it's time for lunch.   My friend suggests we git some grub at the Roadhouse.  We walk in and the five of us were seated quickly.  SERVICE:  Was very good!   Each staff member greeted us with a smile.   Our server was friendly, polite and right on top of taking and bringing us our drink orders.   Plus once our vittles arrived, he was never far away if we needin' anything.  FOOD:  OK, now ya'll tell me what's wrong with this here picture:  We're in this restaurant called \"Texas Roadhouse\" and they do, yes ya'll guessed it, steaks and BBQ!   But do any of us order a Texas sized steak or a slab O' ribs or a pile of pulled pork or a big ol' burger or any other stick to yer ribs item on the menu?   Heck No buckeroo!    Two of us order the Chicken Critter Salad and the other three order the Chicken Critters.   Someone call the sheriff 'cuz this should be again' the law!  Now that I got that outta ma system...  The Chicken Critter Salad (greens, jack & cheddar cheeses, egg, tomato, and bacon) was filling and pretty tasty.   Chicken Critters are Chicken strips with a different batter on um.   When they be fried up the batter runs and they look like them hole jumbo prawn thingamajigs!   Kinda kewl!  We 'all finished our mid-day vittles and moseyed on back to the ranch.  4 stars."}
{"text":"New management has ruined my favorite restaurant. No longer as good as they were. Biscuits taste like crap overcooked and udercooked. Steaks come out burnt or really fatty. I gotta find a new spot. Someone please help me"}
{"text":"First off, the waitresses are amazing; as for the hostesses, well they can go kick rocks. I would give a lower rating if the waitress wasn't so good. We had called ahead for my sisters bday dinner and 3 of 12 people showed up early for the time we set, they wouldn't seat us. Even when 2 more people showed up they wouldn't seat us. Most of our party was stuck in traffic instead of letting us sit and order drinks, we were told to either wait outside or go to the bar (which had no room) FINALLY an hour later than our called in time they let us sit and squished us up against another party. Not to mention no AC was on!!! Ridiculousness!! We called ahead and they wouldn't even seat us! Bad business."}
{"text":"I love the food steak was very tender,the shrimp is definitely deliciously good been there twice will be going back tomorrow and the waiter name Chris is very pleasant his personality is the best!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went after the both of us had a long week of work. We wanted a date night and treat ourselves to a delicious dinner. We had call ahead seating and was told 45 minutes to an hour. We waited about 35 minutes and got seated. Waiter was nice and kind but it took over an hour to get our dinner! The waiter kept \"checking on it\" but nothing! It also seemed like she was avoiding us ! Finally my fiancé told the waiter to not even bother and just bill us for our appetizers. The manger came to speak with us and Apologized for our long wait and the whole check was on the house. He came and gave us our dinner and was kind about it. Big thanks to the manger for stepping in and taking action!"}
{"text":"So a very good friend wanted to take me and my man out for supper we didn't know where we were going but we knew we were having steak! My man and I don't eat much red meat and I'm thinking oh it better be good\"!!! To my surprise!! We going to Texas Roadhouse!!! Now I've been there when we lived in Oregon hmmm not impressed! But we have some other friends that absolutely love it and the location we went to !!!wow!!! I was extremely impressed! Our server geo was absolutely incredible!! I had to send my steak back which I already gave her a heads up the manager jenal (if I remember right) brought it back they can be sisters !!! Omg!!! Don't confuse me!! Even being in the bathroom people were great! So anyways service a 10 plus food a 10 plus atmosphere a10 plus everything turned out a 100 percent!!! Thank you I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with not only the food but the service. I don't care how good the food is at a restaurant if the service is bad. Service here was very good. It did take a little bit for them to seat my party of 8 but once they did the service was friendly, fast and accurate. Well done. I enjoyed the food as well. I will go back."}
{"text":"My fiance and I stopped here for lunch this last weekend. We were seated promptly and waited for our server. We waited a good 10-15 minutes for our server. When she finally came over we each ordered a beer and a water. She came back approximately 5 minutes later with our water and said she was waiting on the beer. There was no one seated at the bar and the place was nearly empty so I'm not really sure why she had to wait for our beers. We ordered when she gave us our waters. She then walked away and 15  minutes later we still didn't have out beers. If they were super busy I would understand but there were maybe 4 other tables in the whole place. We were seated right behind the hostess stand and watched 4 employees and the manager who seemed to busy flirting and joking with his employees to do his job joke around and talk about their weekends. After waiting nearly 30 minutes for our beers to arrive and watching the disgusting manager flirt with 17 year olds we walked out. I will never eat here again. The service and management is absolutely horrible!!! I will be sure to warn friends and family about this place."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch before tackling IKEA. The hostess sat us, gave us some bread and said our server would be right with us...that never happened so after 15 minutes we just left. On a side note, the bread plates were dirty."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 2 stars because they only open late they have no lunch hours even though there are many businesses nearby.  The have no family night and you can only get prime rib on the weekends.  They also don't give any bags of peanuts to take home.  I waited for these to open because I thought it would be like the Bridgeville location where they do everything this location doesn't.  Maybe this manger needs to talk to the Bridgeville manager and do what he does.  Also when I did get a prime rib it was mostly fat, I have never had that happen at the Bridgeville location.  It sucks to have to drive so far when they have a close location but you have to go where they have the better service.  Try the Bridgeville location and you will see a huge difference and you to will downgrade your stars for this store."}
{"text":"First time at a Texas Roadhouse. Went there for my birthday.  We ordered ribeye and shrimp and both were wonderful. Great prices. Good service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I usually go to this Texas Roadhouse for the early bird $8.99 special. It's a great deal and the food and service has always been great. Went in today (Saturday) and the bar was packed. I usually try to avoid super busy times and expected the worst. I am happy to say Ashley the bartender was fantastic. If I had been the only one one at the bar the service could not have been better. I never had to ask for anything, Ashley anticipated my every need. The ribs I had were very tasty. I give Texas Roadhouse in Metro Center my highest recommendation. The staff there has never disappointed"}
{"text":"I've been here before and was that is why I was so shocked at my meal last night.  Got the 10oz prime rib that had at least 3oz + of fat, the fries were dry and room temperature-- pretty tasteless and the 1 1/2 tablespoons of green beans had a weird chemical smell. The bread was good.   Wont be returning."}
{"text":"I have been to the Texas Roadhouse quite a few times now. The service provided at the place is excellent. The people are very friendly. They have a fantastic atmosphere down there. The warm breads are the best thing about that place. Thats what makes me go back. The food is pretty good too. I have tried out a few dishes and have never been disappointed. Its just by the East Towne mall. So parking is not a problem too.  The only downside is that there is a huge waiting time. They dont take phone reservations. So you need to go there and get in the queue. But you get peanuts while you are waiting for your turn. But the tasty food makes the wait worthwhile."}
{"text":"This place was very busy. The dinner rolls are amazing. We were with two other couples and the average ticket was $25 with a tip. They messed up two of our orders, but fixed them right away. As far as service, it was quick. The salad dressings are homemade and tasty too. The baked potato's were good, the steak was good too. No one at our table really loved the salads, but they were clean. I would say the ambiance was the worst thing: crowded, busy, loud, hurried.  They should rename this place to \"Middle of the Roadhouse.\""}
{"text":"Meh.  It's loud, dirty, plays crap pop country and the food isn't awesome. Water glasses smudged, dirty Mesa tap water.  My bread plate was dirty.   Complimentary bread was delicious!   So here's the reason I decided to write this review:  steak and chops overcooked.  I feel like a steakhouse should absolutely be able to cook their meat right.  Ordered steak rare and pork chop medium rare.  Steak was medium and pork was well done.  They murdered that meat for the second time smh. Mashed potatoes were runny and tasted blown out.  Fried pickles were ok.  Ranch suuuuuucks."}
{"text":"Boom!!! They finally put BLUE MOON on tap! Been coming here for years. Food has always been great but the beer selection was taking a turn for the worse. Not anymore. Highly recommend for good food, beer and service. (Especially at the bar)"}
{"text":"Still good food. We enjoy it. Our issue is everyone elses issue. The young kids talking to each other while customers just wait is getting out of hand. It must not bother most because this place is always packed. John the bartender should be promoted to manager, the guy takes control of everything. But my main reason for the 3 star is because. Take out just sucks anymore. Nothing is ever right..thank god we check at the counter. Here is an idea, instead of talking to your friend about what happened at school, Shut up and listen to the customers order, write it down correct and check it before you bring it out. TAKE PRIDE IN YOUR JOB.. As prices start going up at a good restaurant people that enjoy the place will keep coming back. If we are treated like idiots we will go someplace else regardless how good the food is."}
{"text":"This will be my last trip to this \"steakhouse\". This was the 2nd in the last three trips that they undercooked my filet. Not by a little bit either. Ordered a medium and twice ended up with very rare piece of meat. Really no excuse for this.   The only reason I gave this 2 stars is that I appreciated their initial response to the problem. But apologizing doesn't help a fix a line cook who can't cook a steak and then screws up a re-fire.  If you like steak, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great place for family and larger seating requirements.  The steaks are great and our kids loved the kids menu."}
{"text":"We love Texas Roadhouse because of the rolls!!  The last 4 times we have gone our steaks are always under cooked.   Yesterday the same thing happened.   Why can't they just get my steak right!! ugh!!!"}
{"text":"Best prime rib in town, IMHO. My wife and I  share the 16oz and sometimes get eztra sides. The waitress was fantastic! Our drinks never reached 3/4 empty. She brought extra rolls without being asked and made sure everything we needed was there BEFORE the food arrived. One of the best experiences, since we've been going there...15 or 20 years, I think."}
{"text":"Oh where do I start with my disappointment today. I walk into the restaurant and am brought to a table without the best rolls and butter but I think ok it's just a small thing. I let the hostess know it's my dad's birthday thinking it will be take care of....again wrong.  My parents arrive and join me. I show the waitress the coupon for a free appetizer because of the birthday, yes mentioned it again, but I digress.  I am down to an empty tea glass and wait for a refill while the table across from me gets their tea refill; but none 4 me.  I literally have to put my empty tea glass out and move it to get the refill, eventually.   The meal arrived but my gravy was missing and moms ribs were burnt.  We eventually see our server mom gets better ribs and I get cold gravy to go with my chicken; all taken home.  Leftovers to go not before I had to ask for a bag to carry the 3 containers in and did I mention about the bill?  The server came back clicked her nails at the end of the table, waited, until she realized we weren't ready as Dad was still eating.  Eventually the bill was paid, Dad finished his which he enjoyed so glad since again it was a birthday dinner.  However we left sadly without the singing a great person and a special birthday dinner deserved!!  Honestly crestfallen is not a strong enough adjective from this diner to describe the dinner tonight."}
{"text":"Received my salad with a fly in it. The manager came over to apologize but still charged me for my meal. Terrible customer service. Own up to your mistakes and make them right"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd bad experience at this location. First we were there for a hour and no food, and the manager came to our table and gave us a coupon for our meal. The 2nd time one of our two steak was under cooked, so we paid for one and keep the coupon. The 3rd time again we had an under cooked steak and that's when the customer service was trouble. First the manager took half off my steak then after we complained they took the rest off. We tried to use the coupon to pay for the other steak, which was half of the coupon amount. They refused to give us another coupon for the remaining amount. So then we tried to use the remaining amount for a friends meal and they refused. Needless to say we will not going back to this location, because of the awful customer services. As a steakhouse, you would think they know how to cook a med steak."}
{"text":"We came in looking forward to getting a great steak lunch. We sat down, ordered drinks. As we were getting up to pick our porterhouse and ribeye's we noticed a living cockroach walking around on our table. We got up and notified the manager who was cooking in the back. He said oh, ok. That's it! We left"}
{"text":"This place rocks. I love there food & our waitress was THE BOMB. So much so that I made sure to advise her manager. People so often take the time to complain but never give the same courtesy to give praise. I however don't have that problem !"}
{"text":"Horrible!!! I gave this place another shot! Yeah never again!!!! Try to serve a cheap sirloin for an expensive filet!!! Then my son orders his tbone  med well and gets it med rare!!! I am not paying 20 dollars a plate for us to have a horrible experience all the way around!!! I do not recommend this place!!! Poor quality for the price you pay!!!"}
{"text":"Not that great. Chain food. Cold fries. Twice. First and last visit. Each to their own"}
{"text":"Don't Take Anyone Here With A Nut Allergy. Lesson Learned. I Truly Love This Chain...However the place could clearly be a little better with proper management. Love the food here and the theme.."}
{"text":"I give this RESTAURANT 5 * because my Dear, late Dad loved to eat here when given the opportunity! I got him here as often as possible, the last time about 1 yr before he passed, as he was less able to eat out.. How he enjoyed it here; he invited our entire family EVERY TIME TO ENJOY WITH HIM! Dad liked all your food, staff, etc! You made my Dad happy, which means so much in my heart! Ty! BTW,  the rest of my family still enjoys your place!"}
{"text":"amazing food, worth every penny!!! home-made rolls to die for, excellent service, mouth watering steak!!! I give it 6 stars!!!  Some people complain about the wait or parking, well when its that good you should expect a wait for parking and to be seated. WORTH THE WAIT !!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience.  One of our greatest difficulties is finding a restaurant that has a decent kid's menu.  We ordered the rib basket for our two little ones and they loved it!  The meat had a nice flavor without an over abundance of salt.  Also, the peanuts helped keep our kids entertained while we waited for our food.  The service was top-notch.  Our kids food was to our table quickly (which we always ask for) and our food was not too far behind.  My wife had the smothered chicken which was moist, flavorful, and nicely balanced with onions, mushrooms, and cheese.  I had the 8 oz sirloin prepare to a medium which was actually done correctly.  My sweet potato and grilled onions were excellent sides to complement the steak.  Overall, fantastic experience.  It is definitely a \"go-to\" for my family when we are craving a solid meal for a great price."}
{"text":"Did I come on the wrong night??  After reading the 2 reviews I think I must have .. Yes, my ribs did fall of the bones but, it was fall of the bones DRY! The house bread was nice and fresh and I had the best sweet potatoes. But, I came for the ribs~!  Supposedly they are also known for the prime ribs but my friend was not happy with his. Our server was great but MY RIBS WERE DRY!!!!!!!  Don't mess with me when it comes to my  meat!!!!"}
{"text":"I'll give 2 stars.....5 star for the service we received...our server was excellent...now t 0 star. It was my birthday. We have been to other Texas Roadhouse restaurants that have been very good. Not so much here. I ordered the ribeye my wife the shrimp....They must have dumped the whole container of seasoning on our dinners. Scraped off what we could...still not good. Get your orders without seasoning....you will be able to enjoy it then..."}
{"text":"Ad far as I'm concerned this is the best value steakhouse around.  Not quite as good as the top end places, but darn good for the price"}
{"text":"I went there and got a Bacon Cheeseburger and it was absolutely disgusting.  Yuck.  The service was great though."}
{"text":"My daughters favorite place. Always a wait but it's ok with great food and great customer service it's worth it. Keep up the great job Texas Roadhouse"}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant coming here due to the reviews. First time here and It was amazing! Our server Jherica (I'm sure I'm butchering her name) was constantly checking on us too see if we needed anything.The manager came over to check on us too as he heard it was our first time there. Food was great, cooked perfectly and the bread was hot,fresh and VERY tasty. The peanuts kept my three small children busy. Way cooler than coloring to keep them occupied. We are only in Arizona for the weekend and may have to eat there one more night before we head back to Vegas cause it was that good.All around a great experience."}
{"text":"So, I really like steak.  I regularly patronize Outback for the affordable, tasty meat they never fail to produce.  This first encounter with Texas Roadhouse yielded the following opinions:  Texas Roadhouse is the American Cowboy version of the Aussie Outback.  Lots of similarities. Outback is, however, more flavorful. The sweet potato has more sugar, but is somehow less sweet.  Still tasty though! I could do without the prime rib in the future.  We were seated very quickly, despite the busy night.  It was almost too quickly... half our party was on the way to the table while the other was still trying to get through the front door.  Service was pleasant but brief, also due to the busy night.  There were several birthdays in the house, as evidenced by the echoing \"YeeHaw!\"s every so often.  Our small party ordered very similar meals to what we're accustomed to at Outback, and that was probably a mistake.  I shouldn't have put Outback expectations on Texas.  The salad was a perfectly fine side salad, the veggies looked standard, and the mashed potatoes had good flavor.  I enjoyed my sweet potato topped with toasted marshmallows, and felt only a little guilty about it.  The prime rib however tasted like ham.  I don't actually like ham, nor did I order it, so I wasn't pleased with the taste in my beef.  I think it was slightly overcooked from my requested medium-rare, but it was tender enough I wasn't too upset.    I would return to Texas Roadhouse if I was in the area, and I'd order sirloin.  But only after Yelping to make sure there are no Outbacks in the vicinity."}
{"text":"So they Texas road house just opened recently. I figured lets check it out with the kids. They loved the peanuts and throwing the shells on the floor!  There was a bit of a wait. Like 15 min. However it was fine. I thought a Thursday night would be slow and being worried about getting kids to bed on a school night.   Now, we had Mellisa as a server and she rocked! Service was awesome food was great. Steak was a little under cooked from what I order and she kept asking me to send it back. I figured it out! Where the cook checked it on the grill was perfect. The other side of the steak was just a bit thicker and not as cooked. So I didn't send it back and it was totally fine! She continued to check on us! More bread. Refills.! Never really had a delay!   Ask for her. Mellisa. Lol. I love good service. Good people and vibes. She had it all. The family was happy and now my son needs no get out of the restroom to go home!!"}
{"text":"We love Texas Roadhouse!  This location is the the best one.  We ordered the Rib-eyes.  We both love them medium rare.  My wife's came out well done.  We informed our waitress and without hesitation rounded up the manager.  He came right over and pretty much demanded we get another one, even though my wife had already started on the one served.  Small problem with an easy fix.  We left very happy!"}
{"text":"No... just no. Bad food that is poorly prepared. I came in 45 minutes before close and I was getting negative stares and the hostess seemed as though I was the biggest inconveince. The waitor seemed irritated as well. I always tip 25% but not this time. I went back a few times and had to just give up on it. Go to outback instead."}
{"text":"The place was our favorite place for years.  But just turned around when we saw the health grade today.  91 and the outside smelled like hot garbage from the waste area in the parking lot.  They need to shut for a week and clean.  Outside and in is in need of a good scrub.."}
{"text":"First time at this particular location, it was OK. We went on valentines day this year, seating was fast even with the big crowd. My husband and I had the 2 for 35 the sides were good but the basic barbecue boneless chicken, sirloin, and ribs were not satisfying. We chose the sirloin and chicken because you can have two meats, I tasted the sirloin it was dry and unflavorful due to fact I don't eat read meat I was curious of the taste not what I would eat again. The barbecue chicken was dry and grilled. The meats on the choices could be better in taste. Umm won't be back. I think I'll try my local TRH here in Gastonia next time."}
{"text":"the folks out in willoughby LOOOOVE their texas roadhouse.  especially on a saturday night.  every year, my mom wants a steak for her bday.  and every year, we go to longhorn steakhouse, since it's her favorite.  correction - *was* her favorite.  texas roadhouse has surpassed the little ol' longhorn.  and it's not the ambiance you're going for- you're there for the meat.  *that's what she said*  all kidding aside, they know how to grill a decent slab of beef.  and barbeque a hunk of chicken.  word to the wise?  do *NOT* bring your vegan friends here.  they will hate you for the rest of your life.  but do you have some friends (or family) that want a gigantic piece of meat?  this is the place.  the steaks are good.  they advertise they make their sides there, but i disagree.  i have no proof to that, but i mean- the green beans i had tasted salty and processed to me.  i mean, c'mon, man.    the bread they bring you at the beginning with the cinnamon butter is tasty, the sides aren't much to brag about, but i would come back for the steak.  as for ambiance, if ya like loud, over-crowded, peanut covered floor lovin, country music blaring places, this is your place.  and the service is good.    and if you're going on the weekend, *CALL AHEAD*.  huuuuge waits for tables, and there's no reservations.  however, you can call when you're leaving your house to shorten the wait on a table.  we walked in and had a table within minutes, while everyone else was disgruntled and shifty because they were hungry and still waiting.  overall, i'd give it three stars for crowded, loud, bad sides, and the shenanigans of the good ol' western steak houses.  but those steaks are freaking good, so they get another star out of me."}
{"text":"Last night me and 3 of my friends went to have a dinner, I ordered med well sirloin with fresh vegetables as side, my boyfriend ordered med well rib eye and he also have fresh vegetables, my female friend ordered med well sirloin as well, because English is not our first language, the waitress repeated carefully to make sure she got the right thing. After the meal, all of us are upset because there are many problems. 1. The waiting time was too long(40 mins after we ordered) 2. My female friend got med rare, and when we asked the waitress, she insisted that's what my friend ordered, but all of us remembered she repeated the order and it was not med rare. 3. I got well done instead of med well, it is definitely well done with no pink, and it taste really bad when it's well done, so I asked the waitress if she got it wrong, she said NO without even look at my steak, when I ask her why my boyfriend's med well has pink on the steak and mine doesn't, she told us, \"Because you ordered different steak\"... I have eat MANY steak in 24 years of my life, and I never heard that different steak can look so different when they are both med well, and I never saw a med well steak without pink. And most importantly, the attitude of the waitress was so bad that everyone in our table was not happy.  4. Both of my boyfriend and I ordered fresh vegetables for the side, but his come with carrots and mine doesn't.  5. I asked to talk to the manager, I could see the waitress was not happy about it, she shows me a really bad attitude, I guess I just really want someone to see that my steak isn't med well and I can't eat it because it's too hard to chew, the manager came and said it is look well done to her, and asked me if I want a new plate, I rejected because my mood was ruined by the waitress.  6. Neither the manager nor the waitress apologized for attitude or the food. They gave me a 8 dollars discount without telling me or explain anything to me. And when we asked for the check, the waitress just ignored me, she smiling to my friend and giving them their check and throw my check in front of me and said nothing.  7. We are big fan of the restaurant and we drive 25 minutes there every week for last 3 years for the good steak. I never experienced the food and the attitude like this in any restaurant."}
{"text":"The Steaks ,Ribs and pork-chops are delicious! It makes me miss my mama's cooking back in Texas! The Drinks are delicious too!"}
{"text":"Takes reservations NO they refer to it as \"call ahead\" and tell you this after you arrive. I am giving this 2 stars based on the initial experience not the food which was excellent. We called ahead for a reservation 1 hr and 20 min before arrival for a party of 9, 7 seats and 2 high chairs for infants. Upon arrival, Sarah our hostess informed us their tables only seat a max of 8 so we needed to wait for 2 tables side by side. I asked how long and Sarah not quite so politely said \"not too long\" no appx time. My husband asked if reservations meant anything and we were curtly informed it's a call ahead not a reservation. So we waited in the entry way with 5 children and 4 adults for about 15 min watching about 50 people getting seated before us. We decided to move inside to make ourselves visible and Sarah asked me upon entry \"have you been helped?. Well yes Sarah we are waiting for 2 tables together and we just watched about 50 people get seated already. Another 10 min and we received the text saying our table was ready. When brought to the tables we were disappointed that we were being sat in an area of high booths that would not allow the high hairs close enough to the table for the babies to eat. Then we were told the 2 high chairs we needed were not allowed in the walkway. I asked to speak to the manager. The manager NEVER came. Miraculously 2 booster seat high hairs were available and one had a broken latch. Our servers were great and food came quickly and was great but our entry into the establishment was terrible beginning with \"Sarah\"."}
{"text":"Josh, our server, was awesome. He made the experience amazing. The food was typical and the atmosphere was typical.   Josh made it good. They were very busy and he made sure we were up to speed on our food and drinks never went empty.   Give that kid a raise!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was so ecstatic to hear that Texas Roadhouse would be moving in right on the street from me. Me and my husband arrived about 6 p.m. it was pretty busy but we got a table in about 10 minutes regardless and our server was Rachael. ..Besides the food being absolutely amazing...this particular server was just way above our expectations. Regardless of how busy it was she was so attentive made sure that everything was ok and went above and beyond her role as a server. Just because how interactive  and attentive she was we will definitely be coming back more often!! This establishment definitely picks their employees well."}
{"text":"Ok, here's the thing.  We were here February 11th. Had the ribeye, were not happy, as I posted before, what made it great was our server, Kelsey, she was the best.  To be fair, the hostess staff was top notch,  friendly!  We decided to come back because of the good things, and tried the bacon cheeseburger,  done exactly how we requested, so very satisfied.  We would suggest 2 other burger options as there are only 3,  say a jalapeno, and a Texas Chili version!?!.  And here again, Kiffani, our waitress was super!!! To top it off, Kelsey, recognized us and came over to greet us, WOW, so surprising.   Oh yeah the WORLD FAMOUS MARGARITAS,  on the rocks does not disappoint.  We will give the ribs a chance because of the good things noted:)"}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse used to be my favorite chain steakhouse (of the \"not $50 a steak\" variety).  This location used to be fine, but the last 3 or 4 visits ruined it. I'll never go to this location again.  The biggest issues I've had are that they simply can't cook a steak to order. They NEVER get the cook on my wife's steak right. She likes it well done (I know, unacceptable) and it always come out not even close. And then the servers always give us dirty looks when we ask them to fix it.  The last time we went, I got the ribeye and asked for it to be medium. Somehow half of the ribeye was RARE and the other half was WELL DONE.   The free rolls and the sides are fine, but I go to a steakhouse for steak. They can't get my steak right, so they no longer get my business."}
{"text":"We were seated right away, clean restaurant, awesome Jamaican Cowboy cocktail and my steak salad was wonderful. Our server, Matthew, was the best waiter we've had in awhile. Matthew gets 5 stars!! He made recommendations we were happy with and kept checking on us. We're just visiting the area but would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Yes it's loud, because people are enjoying them selves, you know like having fun while enjoying a delicious meal after a stressful day at work..  Yep, if one have a peanut allergy they shouldn't patronize it... DU!!    The Texas Roadhouse not only don't take reservations on New Years Eve, they don't take them the other 364/365 days per year either.. Only call ahead.  I have a problem with any one that would sit around for 55 minutes, checking out how dirty  a establishment is, than turning around and eating there,   now I have a problem with that... and that over priced wine,  wait a minute.. it took 2 glasses before one decides they cold get a bottle at the store cheaper.....     TEXAS ROADHOUSE,  have some of the most  friendliest  greeters and servers as any restaurant in Champaign-Urbana.. I've eaten there since the first week they opened their door, and their staff has always been very  courteous and efficient (here just a couple days ago)... I also call in pick up orders, and I received the same great and efficient service as I do when I dine in...  There is no restaurant in the area that beat their price for the quality and quantity  of their food...  And I love the line dancing..."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a late dinner last night, the food tasted fine, the service did not live up to their 'legendary' reputation. Our main complaint was that our server's hand smelled strongly of cigarettes- so when he placed drinks or food on our table, the putrid smell greeted us before the aroma of the food. If he doesn't wash his hands after a smoke, does he wash his hands after using the bathroom? Gross!"}
{"text":"Doesn't take anyother check in besides it's own app. It's always way to loud in the restaurant, Everyone crowds the check in area, and they never cook the steak proper. Medium means medium not medium well.."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. I am a lover of food. I would say that I come here just for the prime rib but that would be a lie. I am in love with their bread, salad, green beans, baked potato and service. Great place! I have an amazing husband as a cook who is very critical of other foods he eats. We have never been dissapointed at Texas Roadhouse!"}
{"text":"Great service. We sat at a table in the bar because the wait was long but it was a Saturday night around 7pm. We came in and immediately spotted a free table near the bar.  The food and drinks arrived quickly and the food was good. Prepared and served as expected.  So here's the skinny. It's a steakhouse, it was good. It's not a Ruth Chris. I would definitely stop here again. (We live in Charlotte and we were driving back toward home.)   In my opinion....eating out,  in general, is expensive and it never hurts to be a 'food snob'. You pay for the ambience, cleanliness, customer service and yes good food. They achieved these goals here and I left happy with my overall experience."}
{"text":"This is the worst Texas roadhouse experience ever. First of all we called for call ahead seating as we were on a road trip. We were left on hold for the entire 25 minutes it took to get there and they never picked up.  The only good part of the experience was we were seated right away. They gave us rolls and butter however, we were not given any knives or silverware until we had to ask for them.  Then our waitress came back to quickly to take our order and when we asked for a minute she didn't come back for 10 or 15 more minutes-way too long to review the menu. She then took our order and then disappeared again for at least 15 more minutes. I had to ask a nearby waitress if they could find her and make sure our order was put in. She then brought one in our party of four their salad but did not bring Chili for the others.  Then she disappeared for another 20 minutes and we had to ask another nearby waitress to check on our food and our waitress. Our waitress then came by and told us that she had put in an order for more bread for us. I told her that we did not want any bread we just wanted our food. She disappeared again and I spoke with another waitress to see if she could check on our food for us. Finally our waitress brought out our food and the bread we did not ask for. She made a comment that she didn't realize the bread was going to take so long. Of course my shrimp was cold and my husbands French fries were cold at this point. Mind you we never received the chili. We asked for the chili to go and were told that was possible but they didn't have any spoons to send with it. Our waitress told us that she could get us a metal spoon and she wouldn't notice when we took it with us. Of course we did not steal the silverware. We then asked her to get us the bill and some boxes so that we wouldn't have to wait for those later. She did return with the bill and three boxes for our party of four. When she disappeared again I asked yet another waitress to bring us a fourth box. As I was exiting the restaurant the hostess told me to have a good evening. I told her it had to get better than my experience there. Of course she didn't ask me what was wrong with my experience or offer to help in any way. That was the most shocking part of the entire experience I spoke with three waitresses other than our own and the hostess and none of them offered to make the experience better or get a manager to remedy things. Of course we will not be returning and don't recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Wow!, I was sitting in the bar area for 15 minutes no menu no drinks not even a head nod from staff. I was waiting for them to clean up dishes from the bar so at least I could sit there. No, no, it didn't happen. They weren't even that busy for a Saturday night at 8:30. I think I'll take my steak money elsewhere  maybe next door in walking distance too outback and keep my truck parked in two spots like a arsehole just for fun. I've had my bad experiences here before but, come on..."}
{"text":"First time in a Texas Roadhouse outside of the lone star state. I went inside and headed for the bar. I ordered some refreshing beer and a Dallas filet steak medium well. The steak was tender and delicious. I ordered green beans as a side which were really good. I also ordered a house salad. The reason for the three star review is that the food took a while to come out and the salad arrived after the meal."}
{"text":"Nice service and good food. I especially appreciate they have sweet potato as side. Starting with bread and peanuts, it's going to be a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"I typically hate eating at chain restaurants like this, but after striking out at so many other places closed for the holiday yesterday, we ended up here because it was the only place besides Applebee's that was open.  Obvioulsy, my expectations were low.    The overall experience was surprisingly good though!  We didn't have to wait for a table even though the parking lot was very full.  The food was way better than I expected too.  And most surprisingly, the prices were great!  My husband got some kind of smokehouse burger, which he said was one of the best he's had in a long time, and it was only $8.50!   We would have easily paid 25% more for it without even thinking twice.  I had the smallest (and cheapest) steak on the menu, which was a 6 oz sirloin, with a baked potato and salad.  Everything was well prepared and fresh, and it was a lot of food for $10.  They also give you unlimited dinner rolls and buckets of peanuts, so there is no way you are leaving hungry.  My husband especially liked the set-up they have where the hostess grabs the basket of warm rolls from the kitchen window as she takes you to your seat so there is no waiting.  The beer wasn't overpriced either.  I know it seems like 3 stars is stingy for all the gushing I'm doing, but I pretty much expect every chain restaurant to be a 2 star experience, so 3 stars is good!  To put it in perspective:  I will never request that we eat here again, but if I'm in a situation where I'm obligated to go, I won't be mad."}
{"text":"Terrible service! The salads were wrong and after he (Scott) took them back we still had croutons on one of them (I guess he didn't have time to pick all of them off).  My wife ordered a tea and was served a jack and coke!  We love Texas Roadhouse, but this one is a mess."}
{"text":"Traveled to AZ with family and stopped here for some steak. Service was on point! Chase took really good care of a table of 9. No mistakes on our orders and he was on top of everything we needed. Food was delicious and all of our steaks were cooked as order. So glad we stopped there for dinner."}
{"text":"I always love coming here for a steak, sweet tea and rolls. Sometimes the steak isn't always on point, but overall you can't go wrong with their prices or portions.   Their salads and homemade croutons are always a go to item for me as well."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this restaurant the line was long but I was able to get seated fast. The food was prepared good and fast but I had flies in my salad which made me not want the rest of my food. I gave it 1 stars but my waitress Kelsie was excellent and we got our food discounted."}
{"text":"Awful experience.  There were 5 of us on a Saturday night.  We were told the wait would be 45mins to an hour but I received the text our table was ready in 40mins.  I thought this was a good sign.  However, when we were taken to our table, it had not been bussed at all.  So we stood there waiting for the bussers to finish.  But we still couldn't sit down because our seats needed to be wiped down.  The service was slow.  We didn't receive our silverware until after the salads arrived.  Our food took at least 30mins to arrive.  Granted, it included a couple medium-well steaks but still.  Our server was slow with refills and did not clear any of the salad or appetizer plates.  I ordered the Dallas filet by itself- no sides.  When the bill comes, they've charged me full price for my meal ($16.99).  I ask the server to correct it to a-la-carte since I did not have the 2 sides.  She comes back after speaking with her manager and states that he will take off $2.  I request to see the manager.  First, Jason tries to tell me that because I ordered the most expensive steak, he can't take off more than $2.  I ask him what he would have taken off if I had ordered the $9.99 sirloin.  He says $2.  So it doesn't matter which steak I ordered.  I then ask how much a side costs.  $2.49.  So 1 side is $2.49 but not having 2 sides is $2.  I didn't expect him to cut the price in half but I believe there's a middle ground b/w half and $2.  He refuses to discount it more.  I then explain in detail the horrible service we have had thus far.  He apologizes and repeats he can only take off $2 since they don't have a-la-carte.  He offers me a free appetizer card, stating that it's worth more than 2 sides.  I tell him to keep it because I'd rather him take off the equivalent of an appetizer than give me a card, especially since we are never coming back.  He takes it back and takes off the $2.  I plan on sharing this story with as many people as I can so I hope those two bucks were worth it."}
{"text":"Great food and staff is very friendly. The bread is amazing and I always have to contain myself or I fill up on bread. One of the best middle tier steakhouses out there. Call ahead seating available and very convenient."}
{"text":"The food was excellent I had the grilled salmon with 6 grilled shrimp and fresh vegetables and a house salad. The salmon was prepared just right along with the grilled shrimp, the vegetables were cooked just right with a little snap left in them.  My husband ordered the catfish and it was cooked perfect with a Little crunch. Both of our friends order steak and the we're prepared to the liking.  Stephanie was our server and she was very nice the music was to loud so she ask t have it turned down so we didn't have to yell  she came by and checked on us just enough so that we could enjoy our dinner but not too much as to interfere with our meal with our good friends from Hawaii."}
{"text":"This visit to Texas Roadhouse could have gone way better. The food was good and all but the service was horrible, it deserved less than a one star. Our servers name was David and at first he seemed okay and good. But then things got poorer. He said that they were out of bread for the night, we were pretty disappointed but then after 10 minutes of sitting there he finally came back to our table and said that there was bread and so we were happy. He brought out two baskets and said that this was the only bread left and that there was no more left. After 5 minutes we saw other waiters and waitresses bringing out bread. We forgot about the bread , but anyways my friend ran out of water but we couldn't find the waiter so we flagged down someone else and we told them about David. She knew exactly who we were talking about and my friend even told him that she needed water. David came back to our table about 4 or 5 times but usually at a restaurant servers come back more than 10 times. He never even brought us bread or asked if we wanted any. We all decided to not give him a tip. We started walking out and he said thank you but he didn't look at the check yet. As we were walking to the car he yelled to us outside and said \"thanks you\" sarcasticly because he saw the check. Overall this experience was horrible!!!"}
{"text":"From walk in, to being seated, served, and leaving... I felt like I was at a family affair. The entire experience was very welcoming, and perfect.   Our waiter, Ben B. has officially surpassed the dining experience for me. He had a smile on his face the entire time, and made sure we were all happy and had everything we needed.   I don't eat red meat, so having to be at a steak house isn't easy for someone like me. They did have a few chicken choices, Ben recommended the \"chicken fried chicken\" which was topped off with white or red gravy, Ben told me to get the white gravy because the red gravy was based with beef... THANK YOU BEN B! To have a waiter, listen to what you cannot have, and basing his recommendations off of it, is superior!   Our experience was so amazing that we even had the manager brought over so that we can tell them how amazing our waiter is.   My niece graduated from kindergarten today, so we went to Texas Roadhouse to celebrate, she asked Ben if they had a graduation cake to bring out to her, Ben said that they didn't, and then surprised her with a scoop of ice cream, hot fudge, and topped it off with whip cream.  AGAIN... THANK YOU BEN B!!   If you stop in Monday - Thursday from 3pm to 6pm, they have a great selection available for $7.99.   If you are ever in the area, stopover at the Texas Roadhouse and ask for Ben B!! The food and service provided are great!"}
{"text":"Service was efficient,  super chicken club dried out. Fries very hot. Husbands rib eye unevenly cooked. Wished they had more Dairy free options."}
{"text":"Love this location. Best service and very friendly. Food is always good and on time. Everything we ask for is provided even those amazing diner rolls"}
{"text":"I don't know why we decided to try this location. Maybe because it was closer than Stapley. Gosh their service is horrible. We called to ask to speak to the manager, this girl got the guts to ask why do u need to speak to the manager? So rude Always get the orders messed up. Decided to give them another chance but I'm done. If you want better food and great service try Mesa not this. Horrible!!!!"}
{"text":"The best place to get steak! The downside is there's almost always a wait. The have the best rolls around with a yummy cinnamon butter."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I love Texas Road house. This location however has continued to be a disappointment. We find ourselves driving further away to go to a different location. The rolls here are consistently sub par to the Texas Roadhouse standard, and we are ALWAYS waiting for our waiter. This particular location tends to over salt the steak every time as well. I'd like for them to get their act together so that we don't have to drive an extra 10 minutes whenever we wish to eat at Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"More comfort food for Surprise. Service was good but the food needs help.My son's burger was burnt (sorry no picture) which grossed him out and he couldn't eat. Told the waitress she offered to give him a new one but I explained to her he really wasn't going to eat anything  after biting into a charcoal burger. My fault. I checked  after going home and it was still on the bill. They are new and it shows."}
{"text":"The customer service and the food has always stayed consistent. Very good, highly recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Excellent staff, great food. Actually the only place a steak can be both well done and juicy. Only place we go for a great steak dinner."}
{"text":"We had a table of 6. The food was very good. The service was great!  I also loved the ability to join the waitlist directly from the Yelp app - which I would strongly recommend as it saved us from what would have been over an hour wait."}
{"text":"Come in here quite often and it's a different experience every time. Steaks are good most of the time and the sides are always delish. The ribs are bleh, I've gotten them prob 5 times and they are either perfect or dry as a rock. I've gotten the bacon burger the last few times and that is really tasty. The main reason my girlfriend and I keep coming back is for their amazing rolls. Despite how loud and annoying this place can get, eating their rolls the next day makes everything better. Will continue to go back as long as I'm craving a tasty, good priced meal."}
{"text":"Went yesterday and was great as always.  Very good service and great food.  Server kept checking on table, refilling drinks, etc.  Always a great experience here.  All the staff is friendly and welcoming to their establishment."}
{"text":"We did the call ahead seating on a Wednesday night, and when we arrived we checked in and waited 5-10 minutes to be seated.  Not too bad since the place was packed.  The part that annoyed me was that one person in our party of 3 went to use the bathroom while we were waiting to be seated.  Very soon after he went our buzzer went off, so the rest of us (2 of us) took the buzzer to the counter and they confirmed that we were the correct party of 3, and asked if our 3rd person was here.  I said yes, he's in the bathroom.  She refused to seat us until he came back from the bathroom, saying she can't seat us until everyone was there.  I understand that a lot of restaurants do this now, but being in the bathroom is much different than if the person had not arrived to the restaurant yet.  So we had to stand in the way of all the waiters (because there was no where else to go and we had given up the spot we had been waiting in when the buzzer went off) until our 3rd person came back from the bathroom in a few minutes.  So do not go to the bathroom, do not go outside to take a phone call, do not move from your group until AFTER they seat you because if they can't see you, you are considered not there yet!  The food was decent.  Good flavor and quantity for the price.  The rolls are fluffy and delicious along with the flavored butter (honey?  cinnamon?).  The other thing that I didn't like was that they do not tell you about their specials.  We saw online that on Wednesday they were doing a special price on a sirloin.  There was no mention of this on the menu or any special menu, etc.  The server did not mention it either.  When we asked about it she said yes, they are doing that special, but then tried really hard to talk us out of it, trying to get us to order the combos with ribs or shrimp.  I understand that they want you to upgrade, but she pushed so hard (and tried a few different times to get us to add shrimp) that it just made us feel guilty and awkward for ordering their special.  Also, it wasn't just about the special price,... I can't eat that much food, so it was annoying that she kept trying to make me order more.  I would still recommend this place for an inexpensive steak dinner, since the food is good and server/hostess experiences are different every time you go."}
{"text":"As a native Texan, I love Texas Roadhouse but this one has gone downhill. The service is terrible and the food is marginal. The last time we were there is our last time. My husband ordered a New York Strip that turned out to be at least half waste (fat and gristle). New Yorks are normally a lean cut. We saved the waste to show to our waiter who then said she would let the manager know. We then received our check and that was that. Thinking she forgot, we called the manager over and explained how inferior the steak was. We hoped our waiter had shown her the waste that was left proving our complaint.  Instead of apologizing or offering any solution she went on to joke about how they could not control the way cows grow. Seriously? Then said \"next time\" as soon as you cut into the steak let us know and we will replace it. Excuse me, we saved the waste to show you! So next time we need to completely cut the steak up to find out how much waste is there? Why shouldn't we just expect to get what we pay for. She acted as if we were trying to get something for nothing. It was insulting. We have gone there several times a  month since they opened. If you love steak, go to Outback. They can cook it anyway you want and they are a very professional restaurant. If this had happened there, no doubt it would have been handled differently. The bill was almost $100 and it was not worth $10."}
{"text":"I have to say this is one of my favorite steak places. Although you will fill up on Peanuts before you get to your meal if you are not careful/ It is a popular place to go. So many times there is a wait.  We came here on Monday fairly early ,so we got a booth right away. This time I got the Rib eye and Ribs. I usually try to stay away from pork. But, everyone raves about them so I wanted to try them. Divine!  However, The steak was awful! It was cooked very perfectly. But, it was full of gristle, not something I would expect from and $20.00 dinner. I took most of it home to the dog and I had to cut it into small bits for her. But, she loved it!  Most every other time I have been here the food has been great! So this one time is just that , One time. Vegetables are really good as well as the potato. We all know the bread is great(rolls) but, not gluten free. Great staff, clean place. Tons of parking outside as well."}
{"text":"Great prices.  Good prime rib. Noise level is a bit high.  Would have given it a 5 but I did not like having to yell my order across the table to the server and my colleague got sick from the peanuts."}
{"text":"I've visited this place a few times. For me, it's just ok. But I'm not a fan of steak. I have tried their catfish platter and was pleased. However, it is hit or miss. When the fish is cooked fresh, it's a great meal. I have, on occasion had to send the fish back because it tasted old and like it was fried twice.  I was disappointed when I ordered their mac and cheese. It tasted like the box version. When I said something about it, the manager indicated that that is one of the items they purchased prepared elsewhere and have it delivered to them. To me, that was a demonstration on how not to be accountable for the food that is sold at your place of business.  Overall, the employees are friendly and attentive.   I'm not sure if I'd visit them again."}
{"text":"Yuk !  So noisy ... food to salty ... what else can I write. I been to better places , not coming back. See Ya'll Texas Roadhouse we are in Phoenix not Texas."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place many times. We have always had great food and awesome service here. But this time the service was above and beyond. Our waiter was Regal. He was personable, efficient and was able to handle our large party with ease. He is an example of what every waiter/waitress should be. We brought our daughter here to celebrate her 17th birthday. We were so glad we did because the entire evening was a complete success. If you like catfish, their's is the best in the valley."}
{"text":"Best hand-cut ribeyes in the west! Service is legendary! Freshly baked bread makes you want to slap yo mama! Ladies looking great and way to hustle."}
{"text":"Accidentally mapped this location further away from where we were in the Phoenix area, but the staff was so friendly, the food came out quickly, and it tasted excellent! Our server Sydney was really nice and attentive. Request her when you come in!"}
{"text":"I love this place. If you love downhome traditional meals, this is the place. The food is quality but affordable. The only downside is that the menu is limited and never changes. It can become a bit redundant after a while of going and trying everything, but it is one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Haven't had the food yet... Arrived at 6:15 for a 6:30 \"call ahead\" - party of 26, from 4-80 in age and still waiting to be seated almost an hour later. It is such a zoo I hope the wait is worth it. Thank God for the peanuts."}
{"text":"Love Texas Roadhouse but this location sucks ass. The one by Metrocenter off the I-17 and Peoria has WAY better management, staff, customer service, and quality food."}
{"text":"Best Roadhouse around the area. All the staff is amazing and friendly, margs are SO GOOD. Nicette gives the best service every time! Prime rib and the grilled shrimp are my favorite."}
{"text":"Beware; everyone in my family got sick after eating here. Medical doctor indicates we came in contact with contaminated substances we had ingested. When I called I was transferred to the owner whom flat out denied this establishment could have contributed as they check their food temperature. He also claimed he knew for a FACT that we should not have had symptoms before 24hours. Apparently he is also a medical provider. We will not return to a place that is not even interested in improving the simple health requirements such as clean hands, tables, dishes or anything else one may come in contact here in an effort to avoid what happened to us! If you do decide to come here; be prepared to be close to home or a bathroom for the next 2 days and have an expensive medical provider visit!"}
{"text":"Simple chain steakhouse. Not a knock on their food which is still great. Interior is a mock Texas style steakhouse (obviously) large interior though, they can accommodate plenty of hungry patrons. I went with my wife and sons we went at which was probably the busiest time on a Friday. There were about 10-15 other people waiting for tables when we made it in. We were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait. It was only 5 due to how large the building is. They also have complimentary peanuts up front and at each table which is pretty cool.   Upon being seated we quickly met our server who brought us their tasty buttery dinner rolls. The rolls come with this, sweet cinnamon butter spread which was delightful. We all enjoyed especially my younger son. They have a pretty sizable children's menu as well. Which we ordered a hot dog for my older son and the steak tips for my younger son. I went old fashioned and got a burger and my wife ordered a ribs and steak combo. Their ribs were great, and the burger definitely had an excellent beef flavor. It definitely had a great juicy hand prepared taste in it. And my goodness the steak tips that my son had? He devoured them. He yelled at me because I was taking too long giving him his meal.   This hadn't been my first time at Texas Roadhouse, but it had been my first time in my adult life. I honestly don't remember them being this good when I was younger. Maybe I was just a picky eater. But it's a great place for families, and they even great birthday parties very well... I say this because for some reason, the day we went there just happened to be 3 people celebrating birthdays. So we heard YEEEHHHAAWWW a couple of times. It's cool though, they actually care that someone says to them \"Hey it's my friends birthday today\""}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. I was there while on business and sat at the bar. It definitely is not designed for an intimate dinner for two because it is loud!!  But the food is very reasonably priced and very good. The beer selection was splendid as well. I would go there again if I am back around here. Wish they had these in California."}
{"text":"Always Good BUT This Time Was EXCEPTIONAL. We usually go to Texas Roadhouse about once a month.  Never had any issues and the service is good, sometimes some delays due to the crowds.  Tonight we were served by Sabrina who not only made our meal a delight but provided an ongoing smile and service which was superb.  The place was very crowded, noisy and hectic but we actually were relaxed and enjoyed our perfect meals.  I usually don't post too many of these (and sometimes they are negative too) but this was worth the effort to have her recognized for her value to the establishment.  We will ask for her on our next visit."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Texas Roadhouse. 9 times out of 10 my meal is exactly what it is supposed to be. The food and beer is cheap (and horrible for me), and I love it. Expect a wait here unless you're willing to sit at the bar as it's usually packed.  I don't love this location though, especially the bartender that is typically here Friday nights. I also don't love that on my second visit lasts year my beer had a piece of glass in it that I caught in my mouth and sliced my tongue with. I called the manager back 3 times and they never made it right. Not to mention they should've apologized when it happened and acted like it was no big deal."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great place to go if you want some great food. Sometimes you may want to go early because it can be packed, but it is worth the wait. The food is excellent and it made by great chefs. I will always enjoy it and come back more."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a rare Thursday night dinner out without the kids (that never happens).  We were seated promptly and server was cordial. The place was busy, but our steaks came out pretty quick.  We both ordered the Porterhouse, but while mine was cooked perfectly, my wife's was very fatty- not what she expected because we have always had good steaks here. I ordered a ginger ale that arrived at the table flat with a bitter taste- this stuff was well past its due date; undrinkable. The vegetables I ordered were hard and tough to chew. We will probably be back and hope this was just one of those nights."}
{"text":"If I wasn't already a HUGE fan of Texas Roadhouse, I would be after last night!! Great food and more than spectacular customer service that went above and beyond what was necessary. Can't say enough good things!!!  We drive 30 minutes for this meal!  Monday is Family Night, and we take advantage as often as we can because our two small kids don't usually eat their money's worth.  Can't beat the $0.99 kids meals, face painting and balloon animal guy (for tips).  I would rather tip someone for being nice to my kids than pay for a meal they don't eat.  Shout out to new server, Matthew, who was fabulous to our family, and the always spectacular manager, Crystal, who runs a smooth operation every time we are there!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"our first time there and it was a wed. night and super busy but had wonderful service and very tasty meal, baked potaote was very hot and soft just the way I like it, steak tender and cooked perfect....keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"I love the food options here. The complimentary rolls are always hot with their homemade cinnamon butter. Love the concept of having peanuts at the tables and waiting area and are able to throw the shells on the floor. The prices are pretty fair. The early dinner specials are always great. The Wednesday night special is pretty good too, but is also very popular so expect some wait time. They always have country music playing and have a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Mostly because we had amazing costumer service. You don't get that very often it seems, quality is a dime a dozen. Our server Karissa was very sweet and wasn't over baring or inattentive, but always came over at the right time. Then at the end of our meal she gave us a bag of peanuts with a coupon on it for next time. Overall the food was great as well and I definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Food is good. But when placing a to go order you always end up waiting 5-10 minutes even if you give them extra time to prepare it. For the second time in a row, I've placed a to-go order and been told 15 minutes.  When I show up after giving them an extra ten minutes I'm told, it's going to be another 5-10 minutes. Understand they are very busy but would rather be told 30 minutes for pick up when calling it in than getting there and still having to wait."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets in the Wickliffe, Willowick and Wiiloughby area as far as steakhouses go. This is probably the second review I have written on a chain, but after dining here it became necessary. I wanted steak and since I am dressed in a hoodie and jeans, a trendier restaurant was out of the question.   Let's start with the service, which was excellent. The restaurant is completely packed and for a Thursday, this was a great sign. The booth we were initially seated at wasn't exactly 'big boy friendly' so we asked for a table. They immediately accommodated us and we were sat at a booth/table combo.   When your seated, they bring your hot out of the oven, bread with special butter, which was really yummy. Since I was starved I ordered the cheesy bacon fries and I'm not kidding, we're out to my table in under 5 minutes. I'm raving at this point about how pleased I am with Kymmy (our server)  who preferably goes by Kim. While still munching on my app, my salad comes out and now I'm really gonna lose it. Is this really happening right now, am I getting the best service I ever had in my 28 years?!   I did the 8 oz filet medium, like butta. My date did the NY strip which was also cooked and seasoned just right. Our side was the loaded mashed, we added sour cream and was pretty good as well.   All in all, for what it was this was just about perfect. My entree was $20 and included a salad and side. This was a cheap bill for us and exceeded my expectations. Trust me, it was a pleasing dining experience."}
{"text":"Not a fan for the following reasons:  1.  Overcrowded, and difficult to find decent parking, and long lines/wait time 2.  They would not seat my girlfriend until I arrived.  It was just the 2 of us having dinner, I found this SO rude! 3.  Dirty,  and not in the \"eat your peanuts & throw them on the floor\" kind of way, our table only had a quick wipe down, and the booths were a mess with food and crumbs all over the place, I had to wipe down myself with a napkin before sitting.  4.  It would be nice to be able to order some drinks when you are seating instead of being told \"oh, you can order drinks when your waitress comes, not from me (super annoyed by this point).  5.  They \"ran out\" of the dish my friend ordered.  Had to choose something else.  Salad had too much dressing on it.  My prime rib was just ok.  Nothing more nothing less however I did not like the prime rib au jus tasted like it had barbecue sauce in it or something.    On a lighter note, here are a couple positives: 1.  Fair prices 2.  Good portobello chicken- very juicy and flavorful. 3.  Good early dinner specials, 11 choices for 9 bucks  That is all."}
{"text":"This was our first time going and the hostess brought us three lunch bags filled with peanuts to take home with a coupon for next time. The waiter was fun and during dinner there was a fun line dance that the waiters did in the middle of the isle. Also a booth near us was celebrating a birthday and they brought a fun little saddle for the guest to sit on and we all did a Ye-ha for him.  We left super full with a lot of leftovers for tomorrow. We started with complementary rolls and ordered blooming onion and fried pickles. We happen to be their during an early bird special and picked from a bunch of choices for $9.99. Super fun and yummy place."}
{"text":"Zach was such a great server. Brought my friend out for her birthday and he brought her free dessert. He was very nice and had great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"The best experience I've had in a long time. Everyone is so nice. They went above and beyond for us. Shelley (I believe was our servers name ) acdently dropped our tray of food on her way out to us. She didn't skip a beat with letting us know they are remaking the food and it will be out shortly. The manager came over  right away as well to talk to us. Gave us some coupons and a discount on our dinner. We never asked and honestly Wouldn't of even expected anything. We decided to try something new tonight and I'm so glade we did. Thank you to all the staff members for making us feel welcome. You guys are definitely customer focused."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is simply the best! We both enjoyed our meal, chicken and steak! Everything was delicious and fresh. Mario, our server was excellent, the sides were great, The atmosphere is wonderful and the peanuts were plentiful!  3 franchise steak houses are all nearby. Outback was the worst and Texas Roadhouse, by far, the best."}
{"text":"Last night we arrived around an hour before closing; the wait time was pretty long due to the act they weren't as busy and we were the only ones waiting. After we began looking at the menu my friend began to scream and said \"there's a bug right there!\" I looked over my shoulder and sure enough there was a cockroach crawling next to me where I was sitting... we began to tell the waiter what had happened and she just stayed quiet and asked if we wanted to move. Without hesitation we said yes and moved a few minutes later. Our food took a while as well and when we received it both her ribs and my steak were pretty much burnt."}
{"text":"Always 5 star service and food !  Got the free onion bloom and had a few of their margaritas.  We had a large group and everyone's needs were met."}
{"text":"Amazing! Loved every minute there! The service was superb, the steak was one of the best steaks I have ever had (20oz bone in rib eye). I will DEF be back. You MUST try this place. Jam packed because it's THAT GOOD!"}
{"text":"It's a bit noisy here and if you have any peanut allergy, stay clear of the place (peanuts and their shells and dust all over the place), Otherwise, the food and the value are pretty good.  I've been having the sirloin steak here for years and have never gotten a bad piece of meat and it's always done to my specifications.  The loaded baked potato or sweet potato is excellent as are most of the sides.  I recently tried some chicken planks and they were quite good.  Nothing fancy here.  Pretty much meat and potato fare, but a good meal.  Rolls are good, too."}
{"text":"Been twice and enjoyed to food very much. Don't care for  any of the birthday songs they gather around and sing but the food makes it worth enduring.  The bread with the dessert flavored butter is yummy."}
{"text":"I like to come here once in a while and I normally get the pulled pork, salad and sweet potato  because I always like it. The hot, soft dinner tolls are dangerous  but fabulous!  I normally  get iced tea but because  it was Margarita  Monday I got a Hurricane  Margarita  too. I asked for it to be frozen, I was NOT told there was an extra charge for that and was shocked when I got my bill that it cost me and extra dollar, $1.00 for them to throw it in the blender!! I HATE that! Tell me up front, don't  sneak  it onto my check at the end. I paid it but will NOT go back to this location  again!! Grr!"}
{"text":"MANAGER IS A TOOL!!!! The only reason Im even giving this place 2 stars is because of the hostess. She greeted us with a smile and sat us immediately. Everything else was just TERRIBLE. After we sat, we were given the wonderful bread and butter, but no napkin or silverware..? Server took our drink order, came back with drinks, took our food order, came back with food. Still no silverware or napkin. Im well aware that the server didnt notice the lack of the things we needed because he was too busy cleaning up his section for the night. (we went in at 9 and they closed at 11). Wiping menus, wiping down tables, refilling the peanuts... I dont even work there and I was learning closing sidework... Lets just say he made it perfectly clear we were his last table of the night. SO! After our food had sat there for a minute, while we were waiting for our napkins and silverware, my boyfriend finally cut in to his MEDIUM paper thin meat patty of a \"burger\", and it was raw. The inside was literally RAW. Not rare, but RAW. Our server was sitting in the booth behind us wiping menus so it was easy to get a hold of him. His response was \"let me get a plate for the burger.. cause there's nothing wrong with your fries, right?\"... As I sat there forcing down my God awful sloppy chicken sandwich alone, 10min later a short chubby manager with a hat on approached the table like we had just egged his car out front. He slams the burger on the table and says \"wanna take a bite out of it to make sure you like it this time?\"... WTF?! No appology, not even a smile?!! My boyfriend forced a bite down and said it was fine. The manager knodded and walked away. Sure enough the burger was RAW AGAIN. I set my card on the edge of the table... the server saw that my bf only took the one bite, he came back with the closed check and needless to say, we were still charged for the burger. Horrible food, terrible service and management... we'll never be back again."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. We eat here often. Our server tonight was Don. He was phenomenal   Highly recommend but make sure to call ahead if you are in a hurry we waited 25 minutes"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to this location and I have to say everything was tasteless and Bland. Even my guest was unimpressed. Chicken fried steak was like flavorless cardboard with gravy. Every thing else tasted like the chef sprinkled cinnamon in. It to spruce it up. We tried an appetizer of Ribs and it was like eating beef jerky and The French fries were so salty they weren't edible. It's not my nature to complain especially in front of friends so I'll let my post do the speaking."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing no wonder it's always busy, every time I've gone I've had a pleasant experience. Food & service is always great, the steak is cooked to perfection and the bread is so soft and warm."}
{"text":"Always a great experience and amazing food.  I always use call ahead seating to save time.  I love that they offer this option."}
{"text":"Service top class.. food was Great! Steak and shrimp was awesome.. bread and cinnamon butter was yum.. our server Jeanine was very attentive and also patient given the fact we had a toddler who was very  cranky!"}
{"text":"You cannot beat the quality of their steaks for the cost. If you want better then you are going to need to go to The Keg, or Flemmings but those places are way more expensive.   We eat at Texas Road house all the time and it's always good. To get three steak dinners each with two sides for $35 is hard to beat. Great steaks too!!!!"}
{"text":"I'd like to start off by saying I've been coming to Texas Roadhouse since I was a child. Ordering the same exact thing for about 15 years now. This location has to be the worst location ever. The service is always amazing! Don't get me wrong. But, on my 21st birthday I ordered my first legal drink. They brought it with the check. I ordered it at the beginning...  also tonight I came here and I ordered a steak medium rare. I've been getting my steak medium rare my entire life and I've never had a single issue. But this steak they brought me just... was very very rare. So I said \"I hate to be that person, but....\" then 15-20 minutes later they brought out my same steak that I had cut into, on a burning hot plate. Yeah. They microwaved my steak. I tried my boyfriends. His was soft and delicious and melt in your mouth. Mine was rubbery and disgusting because they put my steak in the microwave. I really don't think I'll be returning to this location. It's a shame because the service is always friendly. But if you're gonna make me wait 20 minutes for a drink and 20 extra minutes when you messed up my food... and not take it off the bill, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Poor service and presentation on food - spent over $100 with 4 people and they got 2 of our orders wrong.   Spoke to Manager Kerry who sent me a $30 voucher for 2 people.   What am I supposed to do with this? Go back and have bad service again and spend more $?  F*** this place.."}
{"text":"Very good food! The service was good and I left filling plump!! Chili bowl had good taste.I got the bbq chicken and sirloin steak and were both very tasty.they have really good sweet bread and peanuts, peanuts, peanuts!"}
{"text":"This was a difficult experience. Everyone had great food except me. My pork chop was so dry and over cooked it was difficult to cut with a steak knife. I showed the server how difficult it was to cut. The manager came to talk to me and offered to bring me something else when we were leaving. I turned down the offer of course, knowing from past experience that cooks are not always kind with a reorder. She was quick to laugh and inform me that that only happens in the movies. Really? You would stand and call a customer a lier? Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of chains. I far prefer to find, and give my business to, new and interesting local fare. That said, there are a couple of chains I like and one is Texas Roadhouse.  Texas Roadhouse does two things really well: steak and portions. I can go to a Texas Roadhouse anywhere and get a well-made ribeye at a very reasonable price. It made not be \"fork tender\" or the same quality as a $50 ribeye, but it'll only cost me $18 and I know it will be far superior to any other, more expensive, chain steakhouse. But before I get that steak, I'll get peanuts, bread, salad, and sides. So I'll likely have half a steak for lunch the next day.  Like I said, well made steak and portions. I'm good with that."}
{"text":"Horrible Experience! If I could give this restaurant ZERO STARS I would!! Went there tonight as a group. My family of 5 and my elderly aunt who is 81 years old. She never wants to go to dinner cause she feels like it is a bother because she is in a walker. When we arrived we put our name in and waiting in the car and my husband sat by the front door to wait for our name and number to be called. Once it did I pulled our vehicle up to the front door and let my aunt out and my husband walked her inside. I parked the car back in the space we were parked in. Even the handicap parking available was to far for her to walk in from. I parked our car and walked inside with my 3 kids. When I got inside I realized they had already seated my husband and aunt. So I asked the hostesses where they had been seated and gave our parties name. She responded back so rudely and said she does not know and I can look around the restaurant if I would like. Then she went back to doing what she was doing prior. I was upset that she was so dismissive and rude. I saw my husband walk in only 2 minutes prior. I looked around and found my party (keep in mind the restaurant was very busy). The waitress was super nice but when I told her about what happened she offered her manager. When I explained the situation to Kevin who said he was the manager he explained the hostess  had done nothing wrong. He said the way they do it there at Texas Roadhouse is they don't seat parties until everyone is present in the party. I said I was not aware of that as this was our first visit there but that had nothing to do with us. The treatment she gave us was rude and his explanation was unapologetic. He gave the impression he was annoyed by us wasting his time by bringing this to his attention. When we explained we understand this is how they do things, we are not aware of this. So when he said the hostess had seated us improperly we explained that did not have to do with us. We came in and were seated the way we were seated. He seemed to not care and said he was just explaining how things are done and walked away with attitude. We decided to leave due to the poor treatment. When we left we told him we were leaving and we felt he was rude. Also that we felt he was mistreating us due to the fact of an error by his hostess and that we needed to drop off my elderly aunt at the front. He said he treats everyone the same disabled or not. I asked him how he would want his grandmother treated or elderly aunt and he said like an equal. He continued to say he treats everyone the same disabled or not. My husband asked his name and his title and he said his name was Kevin and my husband asked if he was the Manager, for which he replied no I am the owner. It is a shame that people regardless of disability or not can treat people like this. We did not enter Texas Roadhouse and ask to be seated separately or to be mistreated. This was our first visit and after this experience we will not be going again. No one should be treated like this KEVIN, especially not customers ! You have a lot to learn in the hospitality business if this is where your ethics lie."}
{"text":"We've never been disappointed here. Had the grilled chicken and strawberry salad last night and it is now my favorite. We shall come here often."}
{"text":"Been to Texas Roadhouse a bunch of times, but this was the first time to the new  Surprise location.  It was a spur of the moment thing because I was craving BBQ.  So we ended up there since it was new to the area.  It was a Thursday and we had about a 25 minute wait, was surprised by that, but its right next to Sun City and most of the resturants are crowded from 4:30-7:00ish (by the time we left around 8:15ish there was still a bit of a wait), but it was fine.  We were greeted and the hostess was very playful with my eldest son.    We were brought to one of the elevated booths and I immediately was concerned because I had a toddler that won't sit in a booster seat and the high chair isn't high enough for the step up booths... to my surprise there was one of those hi-chairs that attach to the end of the table.  Awesome.  I always wanted to see how those worked and my husband kept saying this is what I want us to get!  it was nice to see a whole area of them hanging as well as regular high-chairs.  I am sure it was a learning lesson from their other restaurants, maybe, because the last time I was at Arrowhead location they didn't have those and I had to hold the baby.  Waitress' were awesome, playful with the boys... we were only missing the kids applesauces but quickly provided.  Everyone was top of drinks, when my youngest was getting cranky from being tired, waiter came over and started playing peek-a-boo with him.    I got the Pulled Pork, corn and broccoli... LOVE their corn and of course their rolls.  Service and rest of our meals were spot on!  Only compliant, it was very warm in there, my son and hubby who are always cold even said it was very warm.  Next time we plan on going we will do call ahead seating."}
{"text":"Don't order the hamburgers here.  We both ordered well done, and our waitress confirmed \"no pink\".  Both came back medium with obvious pink middles.  The wife had to send hers back to be re-done, I ate mine anyway.  Overseasoned to the point of being objectionably salty on the outside.  Almost a salt crust.  Fries were leathery; obviously were old and re-heated.  The staff was fine, our waitress was reasonably attentive, but the food was unfortunately awful. Maybe they do better with steaks, but will not be back."}
{"text":"Visited family at nearby San Tan Valley, AZ who took us here for dinner. The food was great but our table did not have the peanuts (which I assumed was standard) when we were initially sat by our hostess. I didn't make much out of it or compelled to request it. Overall, it was a great experience with family and would go back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. First time writing a review. The food is excellent our waiter, Colby, was awesome and very attentive. Will always travel extra to come to this spot."}
{"text":"I never used to be big on Texas Roadhouse, but lately I can't get enough of it. I realized that I was never particularly fond of their burger, which is what I used to order before I discovered that their BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich was the best thing ever. Now that is all I order here and all I ever want to order, because it is so good. I also love the loaded fries with bacon and cheese! And obviously everybody knows that their bread rolls are one of the best things about coming here. Those butter rolls are so addictive that I am almost full before the main course even arrives.  The wait staff is usually quite good, although one thing I don't like about the restaurant is that it is very loud, although I guess that is to be expected for a place like this. I still think its a very fun experience!  So what a difference a few years makes! I never was excited about my family deciding to eat at Texas Roadhouse, but now I am the one suggesting to come here (although I still wouldn't recommend the burger)!"}
{"text":"Food is always great, I usually get the ribeye. Love the dinner rolls they serve and the sides are great. You get two of them with the steak dinner. Service could be slightly better but not terrible. Overall like the place and would suggest it to anyone"}
{"text":"We went here on Mother's Day and as you could imagine it was seriously busy. But they did an amazing job with customer service and met our expectations when my mother didn't have her steak cooked the way she wanted. They brought her out a new steak three times to make sure it was perfect and took it off our bill and even gave us a complimentary one to take home while we are complimentary desserts for our trouble. I had the salmon and it was absolutely amazing! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came out for a late dinner, 9pm. We waited 13 minutes before we even saw our waitress. It took several attempts to get bread. It finally came after our appetizer had been eaten. I had to ask for water twice before getting it. The waitress never asked if my boyfriend wanted a margarita refill, he waited with an empty glass for 10 minutes so I gave him mine. The service all around was very poor. When dinner finally came, we ordered sandwiches, and the fries did not come out with them. The pulled pork sandwich was extremely dry. At that point all we wanted were boxes to go home. Right when we received our check I waved a manager over and discussed the situation. We still wanted to pay but he insisted he would take care of it."}
{"text":"Good food and great drinks !!! Jason is great in the bar"}
{"text":"I ate there last week and the rib eye steak was not good.  I asked for medium rare and I got a medium rare.  When I was in the middle of eating it i can taste a weird taste.  I flipped over my steak and my steak was all burnt.  I have never tasted a medium rare steak that was burnt on one side.  :(  I could not finish this steak.  I felt bad sending it back or telling the waitress I didnt want the steak.  Felt someone in the kitchen might rebel and spit or do something to my food next time around.  I come from Texas and have eaten many times at Texas Roadhouse.  This was the first time I was dissappointed in Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Whenever we come through this area, several times per year, we eat at this Texas Roadhouse. Having eaten at about a dozen Texas locations throughout Virginia and North Carolina, this one is by far the best. The service is better and even though the food from one location to another should be the same, the food here is far better. When we stay around here, we usually eat here on both Friday and Saturday. Tonight, our server was Hannah Banana, who was exceptional. We had great, fast service and very pleasant conversation. Don't hesitate to dine at this location, and I cannot say that about very many other Texas Roadhouse locations"}
{"text":"Really?  Came here with a big group. They do not take reservations and will not seat you until the entire party is present.  Those of us that arrived early ended up grabbing a seat at the completely empty bar and ordering a drink. The bartender was cool.  This place is obviously very family oriented and when you call ahead the first thing they ask is if you will be needing a high chair or booster seat. That's great if you are trying to find a place to take the kids for dinner.  When we were finally seated they delivered the best thing about this place...the rolls! These rolls are a carb filled dream and I hate that they kept bringing more, it just made me eat WAY too many.  We all ordered the Sirloin steak that was the special of the day. Mine was way over cooked and the sides were all lackluster.  The servers wear shirts saying that they lover their job and ours actually told us she hated hers. Thought that was funny!  I will not be going back here again unless I have to and then I will have a cocktail and rolls for dinner...  Bring your kids here and I will gladly dine somewhere else."}
{"text":"food was good. took a long time and they weren't even busy. my boy friend ordered the t-bone steak med rare and it came out well done. ummm... really. I ordered a bacon cheese burger that came out with no bacon. what the... then the bacon she gave on the side looked totally under cooked. not okay. if the food didnt have a good taste to it I would rate them with 1 star but I must say through the flaws, we were still very satisfied with the taste of our food."}
{"text":"Our family LOVES this place. The bread and butter are addictive. The hostesses are never that friendly, but the servers are always warm and inviting. The atmosphere is lovely. You feel comfortable and at home. The food is always delicious and it's always a treat to take home leftovers and make coworkers jealous when you're eating leftover ribs and mashed potatoes. We've never had a bad experience here. The only tip I'd have is the same tip I have for all restaurants which is that servers shouldn't wear heavy perfumes. There is one server at this location that we always ask to be seated away from because of her perfume."}
{"text":"this my spot for after work if n Friday or Saturday open late and the were to go for a steak and the best sweet potato in the world the set ice always fantastic the only thing that I don't like is you can't get your sever that you want but all of them are grate this Texas roadhouse is the best because I live bye arrowhead they suck all around the at 75 and Thomas is almost as good metro is the best"}
{"text":"I ate here the other day with my family, and the food was amazing!!! We were short of time, but the staff did an awesome job of getting us in and out with great service!!!"}
{"text":"Today was for our Veterans free lunch which was very good Sierra was a waitresses she was great and very cute! Catfish very good and Chicken fried steak delish!!!"}
{"text":"This location on the Westside is ALWAYS busy. I'm not a big fan of the chain anything really & not a fan of eating Texas comfort food having grown up on that & Mexican in my home. I feel like I can get that anytime at my house. However getting up in years my Mom whom by the way is from Texas loves to eat it out just as much as at home. So we went & the parking lot was full, the wait area full & the restaurant full. The wait was just under 10 minutes. The service & food was both fast & yummy. I really enjoy the peanut deal still this day. It reminds me of the local Big Apples as a kiddo. Anyway we had 2 burgers, 1 kids burger & pulled pork. All were loved. I really appreciate the server letting my senior Mom order off of the kids menu. She couldn't make a dent in their regular portions & don't' have a senior menu. So this was really great. Thank You Texas Roadhouse for a yummy Tuesday night dinner & being nice to my Mom."}
{"text":"The bread is so soft and tasty... I loved it.. Drinks are not bad.. Steak is just ok, average I suppose. I hope they could serve faster..."}
{"text":"First time eating at this location....their service and food is consistent with any other location I've eaten at.   We sat at the bar, avoiding a 45 minute wait for a table, on a Saturday night at 5:30! They have call ahead seating, but we decided to stop in last minute.  I like bar service myself, because there is someone there all the time, you never have to wait for a server to stop by.  Their infamous bread and cinnamon butter were gone in seconds....but a second helping would have been too much, because we ordered their crazy delicious fall of the bone ribs for an appetizer. Seriously, these ribs, no matter what, are hands down THE most delicious. I am not a fan of BBQ, but the sauce is toned down, smokey, not tangy.  I ordered the 6oz sirloin, medium rare, with a side Caesar salad and baked potato. Steak was amazing! Quality and taste are out if this world. My husband had the country fried sirloin steak with gravy, house salad and green beans. I wasn't a fan of his entree because it was fried and had gravy, but he said it was delish. The green beans were cooked with bacon..I did not like at all, but he finished the whole thing!  No dessert for us, because in all reality, their dessert menu is boring, but after all that food, who wants dessert anyway.  Atmosphere is super loud and the bar was a bit over the top with some heavy handed drinkers. I prefer the atmosphere at the Peoria location, but none the less, had a great time :)"}
{"text":"I know, I know....a five star for a chain restaurant. But seriously the steaks are absolutely delicious here.  Sure it's not Ruth Chris served with sizzling butter....but there are two \"made from scratch\" sides always included! Their steaks are always prepared exactly how I ask, very little fat,  juicy and thick.  The 6 oz  sirloin is pretty close to the tenderness of a filet.   We ate here on a Thursday night, arriving at 5:30 and it was pretty crowded.  We chose to eat at the bar, which was great because we got excellent service and met a few interesting people.   As soon as we sat down, we had delicious hot rolls and cinnamon butter sitting in front of us. So good, you can't keep them full in the basket.  Also a big bucket of peanuts at the bar will keep you busy while cracking them open. We ordered ribs for an appetizer which were crazy delish, falling off the bone smothered with a really nice mild bbq sauce, which didn't over power the smokiness of the ribs.    We both ordered the 6 oz sirloin, mine with baked potato and Caesar salad and my husbands with baked potato and a salad with honey mustard dressing. Caesar's was tasty and the dressing was spot on. The steaks were perfect....wonderful and flavorful.  If you order extra toppings for your baked potato  (bacon, cheese, sour cream)...they charge with out telling you.   Come Monday thru Thursday before 6pm for dinner and you can get their early bird special and save some $$$ that you can use towards their Legendary Margaritas :)  We always return to this location. Quality food, superb service, fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"We used to come here all the time, and had great experiences. The last 3 times we went my husband's steak was not cooked right, to be fair, they did comp our drinks for it. They used to invite us up to pick our steaks from the display, the last 3 times they did not give us this choice, and all 3 steaks my husband had were poor excuses for a porterhouse. We had to specifically ask for bread and butter after we got our drinks, the waitress tried to make it right, but honestly we will not be back. The service didn't lack, but 3 bad steaks in a row, we just won't eat there any more."}
{"text":"I went last night with my 6 year old daughter who is a very picky eater. I did not order her anything because it's a waste of money and food. she simply won't eat it. I ordered off the early bird menu which has maybe 10 choices for 7.99. I picked the pork chop with green beans and loaded mashed potatoes. The potatoes came VERY overloaded with cheese. I took a hand full off and so did my Mom. We put the cheese on a side plate at which time my daughter quickly ate it all. Wow.   Then she decided to try the bread with the cinnamon sugar butter. She loved it. Can't blame her though, they are delicious. The pork chop comes with a pepper corn sauce on the side which I loved. The pork chop itself was really, really good. Cooked perfect. The green beans were also fresh and flavored just right. I have to say fresh for the green beans because a lot of places reheat the green beans throughout the week and you can really tell. They are just gross. Not the case here.   All in all I was impressed because my daughter asked to try the pork chop and she actually said the sauce was quite tasty. She tried the green beans and mashed potatoes and said they were good too. She proceeded to share my meal (and eat almost all the mashed potatoes) with me and that in itself thrilled me. The very loud music however did not thrill me and thus the 4 stars."}
{"text":"If you have a party larger than 8, do not go here.  We had a party of 12 for tonight and they said they could not accommodate us together (one of our party from tonight said she had gone here before with a party larger than 8 before).  One of our friends said she was told by a manager that if it were not a Saturday, they could accommodate us, but not on a Saturday because they are just too busy.  When our family comes to town we are a party of 11.... guess we cant go here with then either."}
{"text":"I was here on a very busy Saturday night. The wait to be seated was 15 minutes longer than we were originally quoted. Once we were seated the service was ok, but could have been better even with the crowd. The food was good, but the steak was actually a little tough. Overall it was a decent meal though, and would come here again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"They said 15-25 minutes for wait and it was on point. The nuts and rolls are to die for, per usual. Friendly and upbeat server. The kids were given an upgraded drink with lids, perfect. Oh and when one decided to throw a tantrum during ordering, the server was calm and didn't skip a beat. Salads came out promptly and were tasty. The steaks and kids meal then took about a half hour to arrive. The manager apologized as did our server. Honestly, wasn't that long but kids were restless. Food came, it was consistent Texas Roadhouse and we were satisfied. The manager didn't give us a discount but actually gave us the entire bill for free. I'm shocked because we didn't ask for anything and he was generous and just a real pleasure. That act is something that will keep me returning to this restaurant, time and time again. Kudos TR, I'm forever a fan."}
{"text":"I made a togo order around 9:30pm. I made it back to my hotel room and noticed something was missing with my order. I ordered a combo with chicken/ribs with mashed potatoes and chili as the side items. I checked in with yelp so i also received a free onion bloom.   The chicken, ribs and mashed potatoes were not in the bag.  I called to speak with a manager and was placed on hold for 7 minutes. I decided to call on another line and got a hold of the manager. He asked for my name and address so that he could send me a free entree.  I informed him that i would prefer a refund. Since I live in chicago I had to go back to get the refund the same night. I understand mistakes happen but clearly the bartender didn't check my order. This is the reason why I will no longer be tipping while ordering to go.   If you decide to place a togo order from here....make sure you check your order before you leave.   Texas roadhouse has lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times. Usually get the ribs and chicken combo or a full rack of ribs. Free rolls with crazy good cinnamon butter and peanuts to start with. Ribs are fall off the bone, tender, and delicous. Grilled chicken is cooked perfect everytime. You can ask for extra sauce. The only downside is the wai, sometimes they are super busy and it's 1+hour wait, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"The last time was the experience was a disappointment. We have been going to Texas Roadhouse since opened at Mesa Grand so got excited it opened here. Started off like they cared then the quality went downhill so did not visit again for a long time. My in-laws convinced us to give another shot as we have had better steak at other steakhouses or at home. The food was not bad but for the price I would rather make it at home or eat at another steakhouse I know serves better quality. Will I go back? Probably not but did give it another shot."}
{"text":"The steak is not bad but the service you have to feel sorry for... The management is terrible. I've had problems with the East store several times... I personally will never eat there again and I am encouraging many people to do the same yesterday was a success I encourage two people to eat somewhere else... they've offered me free food thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Don't know what the first reviewers were thinking, we had wonderful service. Our server, Jo, was energetic and truly attentive. She was even understanding and sweet with our son. As for the other staff, the hostesses were pleasant and the other servers seemed to all work well as a team. I will definitely come back.   Food: Delicious and came out in a reasonable amount of time. Steak perfectly cooked how we ordered (medium rare). Salads were full and there bread/butter were,as usual, tasty.  My only critique: the beer selection was a bit bland. I would love to see more craft, local selections. It's minor though."}
{"text":"We drove to the Arrowhead area to see if the Irish Restaurant has opened.  I read the name to myself three times so that I would remember it and could look it up when I got home...Lis Doon Varna.  Obviously, it isn't open yet, or I wouldn't be reviewing Texas Roadhouse.    We drove across the street and looked between Buca and Texas and decided we've been consuming enough Italian food lately.  I liked it.  It was louder than I prefer; but most restaurants are these days.  Really, I'm only in my 30s, but I'm ancient at the same time.  The birthday gimmick of bringing out a saddle and yelling Yee-Haw really should not happen.  Especially at two tables right next to me.  I also feel the concept of throwing your peanut shells on the floor is awful, terrible, oh, I'm going there....horrific.  Why is this something that a restaurant would encourage?  Bits of food and spittle being thrown on the floor in a place where you eat...YUMMY!  Now for the good...  as others have mentioned the bread and cinnamon butter is yummy.  The food is good.  It has always been cooked the way it is ordered.  The portions are large.  They will make substitutions.  The people next to us ordered these artery-clogging loaded baked potatoes that looked absolutely scrumptious.  The service has always been top-notch every time I've been there.  The waiters are attentive, fill your drinks, get the orders correct, and offer suggestions.  The service is better than what you usually receive in nicer restaurants.  That about wraps it up."}
{"text":"The Jamaican Cowboy Margherita was fantastic! My mom had the steak salad and said it was pretty delicious! I had the cheeseburger and it was pretty good as well!   Our waitress was nice and would check up on us often and was very nice. Great environment!"}
{"text":"After coming here it's easy to see why Americans are getting so big.  Service was super friendly, but the food is just so heavy and greasy that I can't in good conscience  reccomend Texas Roadhouse.    Came here just because it was close by, won't come again. Service really was wonderful and super friendly but I couldn't come back here."}
{"text":"DO NOT THINK YOU WILL ENJOY YOURSELF AT THIS DUMP.    This evening my family and I took our mom and dad out for a birthday dinner.  We were semi enjoying ourselves most of the evening even with the loud atmosphere and filthy tables until they crammed another party of 10 so close to us that no one from our ENTIRE table could get out to use the restroom or even LEAVE!  (The other table even complained they were too close to us)   We were approached by a big nasty looking man who claimed to be the owner- he tells my husband \"you need to watch yourself, you almost smashed a little girls fingers behind you\".    WHAT??  I replied and stated \" you should not sit your patrons 1in apart and that would not happen\" as we had no idea.   This man then stated that I didn't care about children and threatens to call the police and tried to make us LEAVE!   To you jerk, I hope we meet again someday when I can actually get out of my seat and stand in your face. You are a DISGRACE!  You have NO BUSINESS being in the industry you are in. You SIR are a disgusting human and I will leave this review all over town and along with the 2k people I work with."}
{"text":"Once you have tasted the ribs at Texas Roadhouse, you will never be the same again. You will find yourself daydreaming about those delicious, mouth-watering, fall-off-the-bone, meaty ribs at every waking moment. There is just nothing like them on this planet. Oh, and the steak, it is soooo good and tender, perfectly cooked every time and super flavorful. The onion blossom is to die for and is served with a delectable, tangy dipping sauce that will awaken your taste buds and make you want to do cartwheels across the dining room floor. You would think the steaks, ribs, and onion blossom are the reason I go to Texas Roadhouse but they serve something else that tops every other item on the menu......drumroll please........ it's those hot, fresh, melt-in-your-mouth dinner rolls, slathered in scrumptious cinnamon butter and beckoning me like crack to a crackhead. As a matter of fact, they are my crack! From the moment the first bite goes into my mouth, a feeling of complete and total ecstasy engulfs my entire body. A high like no other................. pure divinity.......... rendering me insatiable................ I just can't get enough.   All of this great food would be nothing without the most incredible service and excellent care that is given to every customer who walks through the door. They make each person feel as if they are the ONLY person that matters. I have been to this particular location at least 10 times and the only issue I have ever had was with a take-out order. I called and spoke to the manager, Kathryn, and she immediately took care of the problem, going above and beyond what was necessary to make me happy. This place just does it right, every time, and has made it to the #1 spot on my list of favorite places to eat. You will not be disappointed. Make sure you go hungry because the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"My husband & I came here for our date night for dinner.  We love this place their food is always good and their staff is always friendly.  Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Great steak, great people. For the price and serving sizes, hands down best steakhouse go try it"}
{"text":"Promptly seated.  Ample parking.  Loud.  First, I was by myself with a book for company.  The hostess wanted to seat me in the middle of the dining room. There was an open corner booth and after asking was seated there.  The ice tea was watery.  The warm rolls with cinnamon butter were filling.  My Caesar salad with dressing on the side drowned in dressing.  I ordered the large portion of the Dallas filet medium well and specifically said DO NOT BUTTERFLY with sautéed mushrooms and took the waitress' recommendation for the steak fries.  The steak arrived burnt and butterflied. The \"sautéed\" mushrooms were also burnt.  I sent it back.  The manager apologized for the kitchen mishap and paid for my meal.    The 2nd filet was cooked medium well and not butterflied.  The mushrooms were still burnt.  Ore Ida makes better fries.  Overall, the meal was lackluster.  It wasn't the waitress' fault.  I was impressed by the manager taking ownership of the problem.  Been there ... done that."}
{"text":"We were seated in the back corner surrounded by big groups. We waited for our server who never came. Other servers at the big tables saw us just waiting for someone to get us drinks. We were even brought a new basket of bread before we saw our server. No silverware so I guess I was supposed to eat with my feet. When I brought the issue up their biggest concern was trying to see who our server was and not much concern about our experience. Save your time and money"}
{"text":"Amanda was our server and was amazing. Set us up with peanuts to go for our spring training game tomorrow.  The margaritas were fantastic.  The crowd enjoyed our Rick Flair tribute. It was a fun night with great food!!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Texas Roadhouse locations across several different states.  This particular location is pretty good.  We usually get the boneless wing appetizer with hot sauce and bleu cheese.  They are quite delicious.  We usually go on Saturday at lunchtime.  I recommend their bone in ribeye or the 16 oz ribeye rather than the smaller rib eyes (10 or 12 oz) because to make them smaller they go thinner which changes the steak to be honest.  The steak thickness affects the juiciness and flavor in my opinion.  For the sides I highly recommend the green beans and steak fries.  One other thing I recommend is the house salad, it is well put together and it is quite good.  No complaints on service at this particular location."}
{"text":"Pretty good. The food was better than Outback and may even be cheaper. Happy hour starts at 7!!"}
{"text":"Dinner was great as usual. Steaks cooked to perfection and friendly Awsome service. Our server Cody was Awsome and very friendly. Packed but only had to wait 30 min for a party of 8. A definite must if you like amazing BBQ"}
{"text":"Seriously I haven't had anything here that I didn't love .. well .. maybe one thing .. the side house salad!  We'll get to that later.  I was here about 2 weeks ago on a Friday night because I was craving fried catfish (yes in Phoenix) and some really good potatoes.  I yelped \"Catfish near 85016\".  Texas Roadhouse didn't come up with in the first 2 pages so I took my researching skills to Google :)  I know steakhouses usually have different kinds of fish options so I checked Outback Steakhouse first .. no catfish.  I checked Longhorn second ... no catfish.  Then it hit me \"Texas Roadhouse\".  I checked the menu out online, saw catfish listed, along with various options to dress my potato.  Win!!    Again .. it was a Friday night ... around 9ish.  There wasn't a wait at all but I sat at the bar anyway.  I decided not to drink and opted for freshly brewed peach sweet tea instead.  It was delicious!  I ordered a 3 piece catfish dinner with seasoned rice and a side salad.  It came out within 20 minutes, pippin' hot and oh so damn good!  The salad was a little on the Blah side but I did't care that much.  The other options for sides were green beans, sautéed apples, a sweet potato (loaded or not), regular potato (loaded or not), mashed potatoes, cole slaw and fries.  The catfish dinner was pretty big so I had plenty of leftovers to take home.   My boyfriend loved the leftovers so much he said .. Man .. We gotta go back tomorrow.  So we did :)  We went back to Texas Roadhouse the very next day and shared the 3 piece catfish dinner with a loaded sweet potato and seasoned rice to -go.  We live about 13 minutes away.  Everything was still so hot and fresh when we got home .. rolls included :)  Of course I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Really, for the price you can't beat this place. Monday - Friday they have the early dine menu until 6pm. This includes a nice list of entrées for only $8.99. My hubby loved his country fried steak and I had the grilled chicken salad (GF version.) Our daughter enjoyed her mini burgers, and my mom really liked her bowl of chili! Plus, the free peanuts in the shell are a nice touch and great for holding over hungry kiddos!  Service was decent, but not fabulous. Our server seemed to have an aversion to clearing plates when we finished ;)   Overall, it was a decent, inexpensive meal for four people."}
{"text":"Went in on a Wednesday for my birthday. We were seated right away since we arrived at 6:00. We ordered drinks which were served promptly. We ordered our appetizer combo at the same time we ordered our dinner. Unfortunately our server didn't put the app order in. We thought there was an awfully long wait for the apps when the server came and informed us what had happened. From the way she said what had happened it sounded like this is a common occurrence for her. We opted to have the order put in anyway despite the imminent delivery of our dinner.  I ordered the 16 oz sirloin and I had loaded baked potato and applesauce. My daughter ordered the 16 oz sirloin and shrimp, loaded mashed potatoes and salad.  Our steaks were cooked to perfection. Sides were great. We had to ask twice for bread. When our apps were finally delivered we asked for extra sour cream, which we had asked for when ordering them. We never did get it and just made do without it. We had ice water along with our frozen strawberry margarita and frozen sangria margarita with 1800 kicker. My daughter had to ask for a water refill.  The food was great. I probably wouldn't order the wings again since they were a bit more acidic than I like and were pretty small bits of chicken. Loved the rattlesnake bites and it's hard to go wrong with loaded potato skins. The steaks were the leanest and most tender I have had in a long time. Wonderful to eat with ease even though I have no teeth. I will go back again for special occasions. The food really is worth the prices charged even though they are a bit high for my budget.  Hopefully on my next visit the service will be a bit better and the server will have figured out a system to ensure she is getting the apps ordered before the food has been cooked."}
{"text":"Now I know this isn't the fanciest place in the world, however, it IS a steakhouse. I'll start by saying that I would probably give them another shot at this but last Thursday night was not so great.  - Combo appetizer was gross (to me). The potato skins were dry, as was the chicken...which they pass off as \"boneless wings\".   - my date's steak (medium) was cooked well then cooked rare after they re-fired. Apparently it was bring your kid to work night in the kitchen.....  - my steak made it out ok (medium rare) and my vegetables were fresh-tasting.   - the bathroom toilet looked like someone might have had a bad reaction to their badly-cooked steak........just overall gross."}
{"text":"Good value for the $$ . The atmosphere is just what you think it will be. Just sit back and enjoy it... The choices are many, chose wisely. The sides were good as well. Come to the Texas Roadhouse to be at the Texas Roadhouse. If your looking for some sort of fine dining then maybe this is not the place for you. Decent product with a very relaxed atmosphere. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time here a few months back, food was so amazing, huge portions. The place was packed! I would definitely come here again for a nice steak"}
{"text":"First off, before I get into the \"bad\" part about our visit, I'd like to discuss the \"good\" part of our visit at this Texas Roadhouse location.   Our server, Gage, great guy! Great personality, energy, and attentiveness. He's the only reason why I'll give 2 stars.   The evening of 2/15/2018, the House was packed - seriously packed. No biggie. We weren't in a rush, we were there to enjoy our evening dining in for dinner. The wait to get a booth was approximately 30 minutes, not bad in my opinion - considering how packed it was.  There was a Girl Scouts walking around the establishment for hours hustling cookies, while her father was out in his truck hustling cookies. Not bad in my opinion, but on the other hand, people came to enjoy their evening - not to have someone constantly pass their table with crates of cookies.  Anyways... what we ordered:   Appetizer: Blossom Onion - had to request to have it fried to a crisp/fully cooked. When I ordered one back in January of this year, it was undercooked and doughy/gooey at the base.   Beverages: One strawberry lemonade and one raspberry lemonade   My Entree: Chicken fried chicken (no gravy) with loaded mashed potatoes, and green beans.   My fiancé's entree: Chicken fried chicken (smothered in white gravy), loaded mashed potatoes, and seasoned rice.   When our food was finally served to our table, our server (Gage) apologized for the amount of time it took and asked us to make sure that our food was hot and fully cooked. Fully cooked? I was a little taken back by his comment, because shouldn't it be fully cooked? Anyways, it was one of those things that just flew over my head because I'm like, of course it's fully cooked, right?? I'm my opinion, why else would it have taken about 30 minutes for the food to get served?   (We requested plastic to-go utensils to eat with, because two forks had old crusted food on them. I should've snapped a picture, but didn't)  So, we're eating and laughing - just enjoying our night. We finish, the bill comes, we pay (and tip, of course), and accepted two lemonades to go.   About an hour and a half to two hours into being at home... BOOM!! Sudden head pain, stomach pain, nausea and gagging. Followed by non stop vomiting and diarrhea. Signs of food poisoning? DEFINITELY!! My lady had been food poisoned. My stomach is also upset at this point and I was feeling a bit woozy.   Focusing on her not feeling well all night, I didn't even bother calling the establishment until the next morning (2/16). I requested to speak with the manager and/or GM, so the young gal connected me with the kitchen manager - who then later identified himself as the owner.   He told me that his name is Carrie (not sure if I spelled it correctly) and that he was the owner. I started to tell him about our experience, about our server and how kind he was, as well as the food poisoning situation.   It was almost as if he got offended by me calling to report being food poisoned at his establishment, and was bothered by the server telling us to make sure it was cooked fully. He TRIED to dismiss it and hinted that it was the flu (Haha! Negative, she had the flu in January. TRY AGAIN!), he hinted that she was food poisoned elsewhere a while ago and it just caught up to her (oh yeah, sure, 1-2 hours after eating in your restaurant). On top of that - we are frequent cooks at home and don't eat at restaurants often.  He had no other excuses to give to dismiss my concern. He pointed out how no one else has complained of getting food poisoning, and they sold 70ish chicken fried chickens that night. He just tried to downplay my feelings and concerns altogether. At the end, he called himself trying to offer us free food or whatever. Umm, negative! We will not be eating there ever again, but thanks. I politely declined and told him that I would rather be refunded, but the server can keep his tip (cause he was great).   The bill (before the tip) was $40.11, but he only agreed to refund $21.98 - a slap in the face in my opinion. He could've refunded the entire $40.11, but he didn't because he was defensive and thought we were just \"crying wolf\". Speaking with him was just \"ugh\", but I'll be sure to let all of the Texas Roadhouse frequent fliers that I know, know about our experience."}
{"text":"Poorly managed, horrible service, kitchen is terrible.  Went here once because it was close to home, but the service was horrible, our orders were incorrect, and we got a real attitude when we complained.  Vowed never to go back, but the family wanted to give it a try, so I gave it another shot.    After placing our order, our waitress completely disappeared.  After 25 minutes, my wife's order came out.  At 40 minutes, I flagged down a manager and asked if he could look into where our order was.  He also promptly disappeared.  How about some communications on why our order is taking so long or an apology, or something?  Finally, at about 50 minutes, our food arrives.  The kids ribs were so burnt and dry they were inedible.  My order was not even complete!  They were still waiting on half of it.  AFTER AN HOUR?    We complained to the waitress, who told us that the kitchen was in bad shape and was angry with us for mentioning it.  5 minutes later, the manager finally re-appears with the rest of my meal, and again gives us attitude.  He too explains that it was the kitchen, and seems mad at us for being upset.  No apologies and no offer to make it right.  My wife complained and had to ask for some kind of compensation, so he begrudgingly took some money off of our meal.      The rest of the food was fair at best, certainly not worth the aggravation of dealing with that staff, the wait or the attitudes.  Never again."}
{"text":"As always, TR did not disappoint.  I tried the chopped steak, smothered with onions and mushrooms.  It was so good!  The server was very friendly and was prompt in his service.  There was no waiting to get a table.  The only problem we encountered was that the peanuts were a little stale.  Otherwise, it was another great experience at TR.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Having walked in with a group of 7 only 25 minutes to close on a Monday night the manager on duty welcomed us in and our server Brian worked with us as if it was his first table of the night. Thank you for your incredible service, will always recommend Texas Roadhouse!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying our waitress Sarah was lovely -- the food sucks and the restaurant is dirty. They sat us in an empty restaurant mind you next to a family with a screaming baby -- they sat on their cell phones for 40 mins while their baby cried hysterically --  mean while we are surrounded by a sea of empty tables. The staff is not cognizant. Especially when I said it was our first trip to this location -- I mean try to make it great right?  I LOVE Texas road house -- went to several in Massachusetts regularly. I will NOT be back to this one -- food dry over cooked and generally just poor -- this location has no quality standards -- I sent my food back -- took forever to get a new dinner and it came back worse!  Get it together guys!"}
{"text":"Got this bowl chilling it so good bought blew my ass to the moon . Spicy gave my but some pop . Chicken critters on the way got a leash so they don't get me . Good stuff"}
{"text":"Great first time Lani was amazing don't remember the managers name but she was very sweet. They made sure our first time was great and that means a lot you don't seem to get that anymore at much places. We will be returning soon"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for a dress up steak dinner without the big price tag. Disappointed by the service and food but they did make up for it with a free entree coupon. Still, I'll go elsewhere for steak next time."}
{"text":"Two of us were in for dinner the other night. We came in a little late and were seated in the bar area. We had excellent service from Dakota, whom we thought was the server in that area, and it turned out he was running the bar and the service area. He did a fantastic job. I'd like to add we've always had good experiences with Borge the food and the service, but Dakota stood out. Our glasses were never empty and he was very attentive. I hope management recognizes what a great asset they have in Dakota. We will ask for him in the future."}
{"text":"Very disappointed  Pulled pork sandwich was terrible  The meat was dried out and tough And tasted bad I had to send it back  It was replaced with a dinner salad  I don't understand why the kitchen would try to serve something that was bad to begin with  Received a coupon for a free meal but afraid to eat here again"}
{"text":"First off, service for me will make or break an experience,  and Rachel made this one an excellent experience!  Super friendly,  helpful,  on top of things, and attentive without being intrusive.  As for the food, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  My Dallas filet was tender, flavorful and juicy.  Fries well seasoned.  Well worth the stop...and my Vikings were kicking the cardinals butts on tv, special for me."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The steaks are flavorful, service is great, staff seems like they really do like their jobs, and everything is consistently on point.   For a restaurant that has a naturally 'dirty' feel with peanut shells everywhere and whatnot, the place is kept pretty clean. We eat in and order takeout regularly. For the amount of food you get the prices are cheap too IMHO. I'm a big guy and I usually get two meals out of it."}
{"text":"This is one of the best chain restaurants in my opinion.  The prices are solid and you will definitely get full.  The one up here gets pretty packed but you should be able to get a seat in under 30 mins, even in prime time.  The steak and ribs are really good and the steaks are usually cooked perfectly to your preference.  The blooming onion appetizer is huge and could probably feed 5.  Blooming onion: 7/10 Steak/Ribs combo with fries and caesar salad:  8/10"}
{"text":"We used call ahead seating when we visited. I'm glad that we did because there was a line that extended outside. It was quite noisy inside, but an upbeat atmosphere was evident. There were lots of peanut shells on the floor, even though each table received an empty bucket for their shells. The ribs were tender and quite delicious. The smothered chicken was also a great choice. The tossed salad was quite large. It was prepared with fabulous homemade croutons, as well as homemade dressings. For an extra charge, you can get your sweet potato or baked potato smothered with some great toppings. Our server was quite sweet. A few of the servers participated in a line dance, but some did not appear to be enjoying themselves."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Texas Roadhouse in years and we decided to use a gift card we received for Christmas to have dinner here the evening before Mother's Day. Wow, what a great experience! Our wait of 25 minutes wasn't bad at all, considering we had no reservation & it was Mother's Day weekend, and we ended up having a wonderful dining experience. Our server, Anne, was awesome - so friendly and attentive - and our meals were absolutely delicious. My husband's steak was perfectly prepared, as was my grilled shrimp. Given the quality of the food and service at this location (especially on such a busy weekend), it is obvious they have a great manager (who actually visited our table) who keeps his employees' morale high. We'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and a great deal for a ribeye steak!  I recommend to get a side of their buffalo sauce to complement the steak!"}
{"text":"We were so excited that there was a new Texas Roadhouse being put near our house, come to find out they are absolute rudest Texas Roadhouse we have ever been to. I wish I could give zero stars.   The parking spaces were a better use than this new Roadhouse. We will not be returning to this location EVER again."}
{"text":"I don't get here often, but when I do it's always good. Waits are long on the weekend but if you do the call ahead seating it helps a lot."}
{"text":"Let's start with the seating.. . Horrible system with seating. They take your name & give you a number.  Then they display your number but tell you to stay aside for another 10min while the waitress stand around talking. This time the hostess tried to seat us but call the wrong number so she asked us to go back and wait.   We finally got seated at a table with no peanuts.  The new waitress was nice & did a good job.  The menu has nothing healthy on it. So, I didn't order much.  My order was a house salad & water.  Simple order though my ice berg lettuce was yellow & bitter. My one take spoon of blue cheese dressing to go with it was ok.  My man ordered Road kill- GROSS! Our was so salty. It was a thick burger smothered with salty onions, mushrooms & cheese.  Baked parasite was the only thing good on the plate.  My son ordered a burger with fries. It was just ok...nothing special & can get a better burger @ Red Robin.  The bun was the best part of the meal he said.   Before leaving the waiters & hostess were dancing but NONE OF THEM looked happy having to do it. All in all...we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place and I'm never disappointed!!!! My favorite steak house! And the margaritas are scrumptious"}
{"text":"Service was horrible!! Not even busy and still had to wait 15 minutes for a drink server brought me a lemonade when I ordered a Coke then had a attitude when I told her she brought me the wrong thing ordered the steak medium rare with the sweet potato and vegetables I got a piece of rubber with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob"}
{"text":"Had a great visit!  I have been here several times before but this time my visit exceeded my expectations.  The manager came to check on us 3 times.  The waitress was attentive and courteous.  They also had a balloonist making balloons for the kids.  I was able to use a coupon on top of kids eat free night so I was really happy for my bill.  The manager also made us aware of their coupon policy which was very helpful.  I am very pleased with their service and attention.  Good job staff!"}
{"text":"This is my fav chain steak place. Service had always been friendly and prompt. You can call ahead for seating and I would strongly encourage it. Some might find the decor and country theme a bit too...but I love the cheesyness.   Starting with the old fashion salted shell on peanuts and the yummy rolls...all of that means I don't order an appetizer. The sangria margarita on the rocks with salt is delicious and the cost of a shooter(they call it a kicker) of patron is only 2 bucks...yes please. My drink with the shooter only totaled 6....great deal. They offer meals for 9 bucks if you eat before 6...early bird!  We didn't make it there in time for that but something good to know. My son had the ribs and they were delicious. Very tender and just the right amount of sauce. He didn't care for the green beans but he couldn't explain why.  I think he was too focused on the ribs. My husband and I both had the 10oz rib eye with shrimp. Steaks were well seasoned and cooked perfectly medium rare. The shrimp were not over cooked and were soft....restaurants seem too over cook shrimp too often so I was thrilled they were just right."}
{"text":"Since this is a chain restaurant I'll make this quick:  Atmosphere: Family Friendly, Loud Cowboy, Honky Tonk-ish Service: Hit or Miss (depending on the server) Food: I've been here at least 3 times and I've never had anything I didn't like. Very versatile menu, everything from steak, fish, shrimp, chicken and ribs. Complimentary rolls are delicious. I highly recommend getting your potatoes stuffed.  Value: Food is fairly priced, be prepared to spend $15 to 25 per person."}
{"text":"Standard Texas fare  Big portions  Service can be spotty Never have had a bad meal  We have been there 3 times in the last year"}
{"text":"No complaints. Food and service were both great. This is one of the better Texas Roadhouse's I've been to. If you plan on going the night of a concert, get there early! We were there 2 hours before the concert started and still had to wait."}
{"text":"Came here on Wednesday night around 6pm and my companion and I ordered a couple of beers. The server brought out beers and it was 2-3 inches not filled. I said \"what's goin on here\" she proceeded to tell me that, that is where the head was. No shit! It's because you let it sit in the window too long. No only was that a servers laziness, the bartender should have re-poured the beers or at least filled them up. There was only 1 person sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Tonight was a really uncomfortable evening.  We only go out to eat a few times a month with our family of 8.  When we walked up to the Texas Roadhouse there was a lot of people outside, then when we went inside we realized why.  It had to have been south of 65 degrees in the front.  Both of the hostesses where wheeling jackets and the waiting area was completely empty.  We complained that it was an icebox, but nothing was done.  By the time we left my daughters lips were blue and her nose was running(so was mine).  I spent the entire dinner switch from kid to kid trying to keep them warm.  I asked about it several times, but again nothing was done.  When the waitress ask if we wanted desert, I just handed her my card and said we would like to leave ASAP!  The rare steak (when we ordered medium well) and the order being incorrect where tolerable,  but the temperature of frosty the steakhouse was incredibly unbearable.  What a ridiculous and miserable experience!  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Good lord this place gets crowded. I can't imagine coming here on a regular for that reason. Food is ok, Claim Jumper comparable and on the salty side. Nice option for a group since even picky eaters will likely find something."}
{"text":"Your contact form fails in any browser, none of the stores populate. No Arizona stores come up on your location search.  First impression was great. Loved the peanuts at the door and on the table.  Hot rolls as soon as we sat down, great.  Now the not so great.  Waited too long for water on a hot as heck day. Blooming onion burnt. Steak tasted like someone dumped a bucket of salt on it and it was over cooked.  Green beans mushy, watery and lacked flavor, even from the hard bits of what looked like bacon.  Ribs were only so-so.  Waitress forgot to being ketchup for my dad's fries.  Salads were just ok.    Based on this experience I won't be back again."}
{"text":"Disgusting! One of our plates had gum stuck to the bottom. I'm so grossed out! How can you miss a big green gum stuck to the bottom!"}
{"text":"it's food with salt and chili from a can but hey I didn't have to cook tonight. good music but could use some better wine. keep it up come on man its just texas road house a glorified cracker barrel. staff is great and very friendly but hey the want a tip."}
{"text":"We are NOT a huge fan of chains - but the consistency of food quality and excellent service keep us coming back. We often sit at the bar- as the bartenders are EXCELLENT here. The service and speed of food is always consistent. This is an extremely well-managed Texas Roadhouse and we have never been disappointed at this location."}
{"text":"Excellent!  I had ribs, my husband had rib eye, my kids had potato skins and chili.  Everyone was very happy.  While the kids weren't totally thrilled with the chili, they loved the potato skins and the yeast rolls that come to the table as soon as you arrive.    Great, friendly wait staff too."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and had the usual service I expect, but this time was a little different.  The server we had this time was super pleasant, helpful and diligent about refilling our bread and drinks.  My steak was under cooked the 1st time, and since I had a topping on it, they had to remake my steak entirely.  Due to their mistake, the manager brought over the steak and made sure it was to my liking and removed $15 from our bill(something I wasn't expecting)."}
{"text":"Let's get the negatives out of the way first, it's LOUD! Now, for the positives the rolls are freakin delicious, hot n warm n chewy and oh so good! They brought out three baskets immediately with a sweet honey butter. We devoured'em and didn't have to ask for more they just brought them out, loved it. I ordered fried chicken which was chicken fried steak with a loaded baked potato and Cesar salad. Might I mention great prices for what you get. The chicken was very tasty and everyone who got steak loved it. They had eaten it all before I could ask for a bite, lol. We are definitely going back. Also, great super friendly staff. Our waitress was very sweet!"}
{"text":"Did call ahead waiting at 6:30pm.  Was told 30 mins. Well its now 8:00pm and still waiting. Last time i come here"}
{"text":"went to one in Texas and the ribs are equally as good as AZ"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the ribeye was so good.  Fried pickles for appetizer.  The reason for 5 stars is our waitress trisha.   She was fantastic.  On top of everything we never had to wait or ask for anything.  She even had four other tables ..  I was a waitress so I know what it takes to make a good waitress and she followed that  When we come back we will defiently ask for Trisha.   If you go ask for her.  She will take good care of you..."}
{"text":"First of all, Colleen is the best server ever. She was so attentive, polite, friendly and caring. She is such a people person it is amazing. Coming from a food service managers standpoint, I would be honored to have a staff member such as herself. The food was awesome as well. Great atmosphere, haven't been to a Texas Roadhouse in quite some time but I'm glad we went back and I'm glad we had such an amazing server. Thank you Colleen for all you did tonight!"}
{"text":"Horrible service from the get go....waited to be seated for 15 minutes and was called up three times and told to wait because my wife wasn't in the building yet..told me we all have to be present to be seated.wife was parking the car and changing out of her work clothes. Alicia there service manager was no help at all!!! Worst Texas roadhouse in the state. . Went to the outback next door and had no problems being seated..."}
{"text":"Prime rib on weekends is amazing. Sides and apps are hit or miss. Drinks are good. Steaks are always cooked to temp. Never had a problem with over or under cooked."}
{"text":"Always enjoy eating here-- usually share steak n veggie plate with hubby. Easy keto/paleo choices if eating out is the only option."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the chicken fried steak meal! Super delicious! Love it!!! Great staff! Great atmosphere! Outstanding food! Greatest restaurant in America! If you don't agree; your not American! (:  God bless!"}
{"text":"Me and Julie's first time here. After a long drive from fantasy springs hotel and casino, I Yelp this place in Phoenix off the 10 freeway and decided to try it. Good service. It was fast as soon as we got in. When they sit you down, the hostess has a basket of bread and sweet butter which was good. There are a bucket of peanuts at every table. Portions are good size. I had the mushroom burger and my girlfriend had the rib eye. Both good. It's lively place with lots of tv's. They also have steak you can buy and bring home to cook. If I'm visiting again in the area, I would try this place again."}
{"text":"I'm a long standing customer of the Texas Roadhouse on N. 75th Ave. in Phoenix.  I'm guessing I've been their customer for better than ten years, so this review is well overdue.  I give them five stars on every facet of running a restaurant.  The hostess is always friendly and efficient. They keep you informed as to the length of your expected wait time and get you seated quickly. The servers are always friendly, helpful and attentive; they do their best to make your dining experience a positive one. The menu is varied, with a great choice of meat, poultry, seafood and salads.  I believe their steaks and ribs are second to none. The steaks are always of good quality, deliciously seasoned and cooked to perfection, exactly as you order them.  The ambiance is very informal, or better said, rowdy cowboy.  You may even be treated to a spontaneous line-dance by the staff.  When you have a restaurant with great service, great food and a fun atmosphere, what's there not to like?"}
{"text":"Best burgers around!   Love the dinner rolls!   Staff is friendly and courteous.   Would have given them a 5, but the restaurant is too noisy to have a reasonably toned conversation ... so we order our food to go and that works just fine for us."}
{"text":"Good steak, great service, reasonable price, cooked right. Usually crowded on Friday and Saturday nights so expect a wait. To avoid the wait we usually go before 5pm.  We usually order the 6oz ribeye, salad and sweet potato. I have always been happy.   Unfortunately the parking lot can be a pain to find a place, thus the 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Absolute horrible experience a few weeks back. Waited over 10 minutes to get acknowledged. Server was too busy flirting with a table of 5 which had 4 young females at table. Very slow to get food and beverages. ..sodas no alcohol. Finally got food with all 3 dishes cold the mash potatoes had film over it from sitting in window. Told server we would need an steak sauce as bottle at table was empty.He never returned. Asked to see a mgr who was just hanging out at table. She came over offered us a new server  REALLY?? We had already been there for over 1 hr mgr bought meals and told us she would take name and number and put us on a list for next visit. SHE LEFT THIS INFORMATION ON OUR TABLE??? it was obvious tht Noone there genuinely cared we will not be back"}
{"text":"The wait was over an 1hr long. The food was great. We didn't wait long for our food. The atmosphere was good. Customer service was top notch. I would Definitely recommend this restaurant. You make want to call ahead to get on the wait list though."}
{"text":"OK at best. More deserving of two stars but the bathrooms were clean and the kids menu was good. I found my steak to be below average quality and my wife was not impressed at all. I didn't feel we got a good value for the money. Try Outback for better steaks."}
{"text":"Decided to take my fiance, mother and mom's boyfriend to eat here for the first time. Bad decision first let me say that the wait four a table was not long with our reservation. Second the margaritas are great that is the only reason this place gets any star from us. The wait from when we ordered our food till we actually received the food was about 45 min to a hour. I ordered the full rack of fall off the bone ribs and I have to say they were anything but fall off the bone. They were very tough, a little cold and taste was awful. I don't recommend the ribs at all. In fact I don't recommend the establishment to anybody."}
{"text":"Decent overall except the pube in the salmon and the roach on the wall. Didn't even take the salmon off the menu."}
{"text":"When in Peoria.... Must visit the Texas Roadhouse. Food and prices were on point, service was excellent - we were always attended to no matter how busy the place was, both times we made it in: Warm bread at your table, can't be beat. We will definitely keep coming back - when in Peoria. Definitely guaranteed to have an awesome experience. Keep up the great job."}
{"text":"First time being here walked tire away was seated. The bread they give you is soooooo amazing so warm and soft. The killer ribs are good the meat literally falls off the bone.I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Texas ribs in Phoenix?  Who would have thought.  Just as they advertise, the pork ribs did fall off the bone.  The meat wasn't that great, but again the meat fell off the bones.  The peanuts everywhere are an allergic person's nightmare, luckily I'm not allergic.  The bread was pretty good and served nice and warm.    There were other BBQ options on the menu, but I opted for just the half rack of ribs which is a good amount of meat."}
{"text":"My chicken was bloody and they told me that all of their roasted chicken is pink and has blood. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"Went there on my birthday, was awesome. The place was slammed, food was great. I've got to warn you don't eat too many bread rolls, they are quite filling. When all was said and done they had me sit on a horse saddle and gave my a big yeeehaw happy birthday."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave the two stars was because the homemade salad dressings were pretty good and the margarita was decent.    The yeeehaa s constantly was so annoying.   The food was less than mediocre.   But the place was packed so somebody likes it.  Probably people who only go to chains and don't know any better.     If you consider yourself foodie on even a small scale stay far far away."}
{"text":"\"Yo yo a big shout out to Texas Road House at Metro center\"... The food , service and whole entire staff , incredible , friendly , energetic and the place was vibrant . I had the pulled pork BBQ sandwich  and may I say my peeps , DELISH!!! Go hungry because portions are big . Omg ... the rolls and cinnamon butter ! If you go let me know what you think ! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We like Texas Roadhouse and have been going to them for years both here and in Ohio.  They are generally very good, but this location just doesn't live up to the Texas Roadhouse name.  We went there Sunday afternoon with a party of 5.  Besides waiting forever for our food, we experienced a whole series of issues with the food itself.   1.  My son ordered a steak with Au Jus and chili.  They brought the Au Jus with the chili which was delivered with the salads.  Of course it was cold when the steak finally arrived. 2.  My son ordered his steak medium.  HIs steak was well done.  We sent it back and they brought back a pretty rare steak (probably didn't want to waste another piece of meat). 3.  I had their pick 4 salad entree.  Interestingly, chili is one of the options.  I asked for a bowl of chili and told the waitress that I wanted to put the chili over a plain baked potato.  The chili came with the salad, not the baked potato ... (which arrived 20 or more minutes later). 4.  My wife had the chicken salad.  She's had it at other Texas Roadhouse locations.  It wasn't as good here.    Service was ok, but the waitress pretty much just took our order and left.  We've had much better and more engaged servers at both the 75th Ave and Goodyear locations.  Bottom line ... we won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"We have been to many Texas Roadhouse restaurants over the years with very consistent food & service. For that reason, we decided to visit this Phoenix area Texas Roadhouse near Ikea right off I-10 & Warner. It looked busy in the parking lot, but we walked right in and were seated immediately. Service started out good - drink order was taken right away and delivered quickly. We placed our order, ate those great rolls, and sat and sat and sat . . . usually they are quick with the salad followed by the main course. Salads finally arrived - finished those and sat and sat . . . finally the main course arrived. Split plate missing, no gravy for the chicken fried steak, drink refills had to asked for . . . this is not normal for Texas Roadhouse and it's not even that busy ! Talked about service, now the food - salads great, check - dallas filet great, check - chicken fried steak not so good, overcooked, forgot gravy, my last chicken fried chicken was way better - other sides ok, nothing special. Lastly, went to restroom, plates cleared away, came back - still no check. Server came by . . . oops, forgot to print your bill - be right back . . . ?? I gave this a 3 - probably higher than maybe deserved, but \"the roadhouse\" usually gets 5 - enough said. Probably not going back to this location in the near future."}
{"text":"Call ahead????????  I called ahead and we still waited over 1 hour...seriously.   And they seated 2 large parties ahead...who did not call.  Service was great and food was great but seriously Texas Roadhouse. ..over 1 hour?"}
{"text":"Steaks were good but found hair in my bread so that kind of ruined my meal. Place looks dirty with all the peanut shells on the floor. Service was good and waitress was friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Best strawberry margarita EVER! Staff was amazing and the food was delicious!!! Great atmosphere....I literally wanted to go back the next day, but that would add up after a while :) Husband had the prime rib and he loved it!!!! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Our  server forgotten we ordered the appretize and had a wrong order of one of the side item.  The voted #1 fall off the bone ribs are super dry, I asked one of the waiter are those ribs are normally this dry?  He told me there is good and bad days for the ribs, so I guess the ribs today is a bad day!  Not recommended and will not order it again.  On the other hand, the prime rib is good, I ordered 16 oz medium, it cooked to order, and it is tender and tasty.  Loaded bake potato is ok (not loaded as expected), sweet potato Can't go wrong, fresh veggies are baby carrots and broccoli, a cup of chili is ok.  The restaurant is somewhat noisy and not good for young kids and babies.  I will go again for the prime rib...but hoping we have a better server next time."}
{"text":"I have been to many Texas Roadhouse's over the years and I have never had a bad experience.   This one in particular is always nice to go into. Everyone has always been welcoming and the services is always quick and helpful.  Our server was Sheldon and he was super sweet and since I sometimes forget I want multiple things he had no problem running back for me and I appreciate that. The food was excellent, my steak was cooked medium rare and came out great. my boyfriend tried the catfish and was certainly not disappointed.  We will be back thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Been here over a dozen times and I don't know why we keep going back but we do. The last time we where there the hostess was so rude. I'm with my daughter who needed to go the restroom and my husband was behind me. I asked him to get a table and I will meet you. When I returned and asked the hostess where she sat my husband and son? Her answer was \"oh I don't remember but you can walk around and look\" now remember I'm with a small child carrying her. I thought how rude to just point to the area of the restaurant and send me away. Now it wasn't busy to where she could help me look but she didn't she decided to return to her conversation with the other 3 hostess."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing but staff is slow and they mostly just stand around. Could be managed a lot better."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner on Sunday (around 4pm) and was surprised to find the place packed. We were seated quickly but the place looked full to us. Man they have a lot of employees at this place. I've never seen so many serving and waitstaff as I seen here. Unfortunately we must have got one of the new or untrained ones as she did a couple of things that are pet peeves of mine which took away points for service. She did keep our drinks full but we had the following service issues.  1. She asked us if she \"could get dessert started for us\" shortly after we were served our food. We had not even dented our meal and she's asking us about dessert?  2. She gave us our check the same time she asked us if we wanted dessert, midway through the meal. This causes a couple of problems, one you feel the need to clean off your hands to dig out your credit card to pay when you're in the middle of eating. I decided not to do this and just continue to eat and then had to deal with her continuously coming by to look and see if we put the card out for her yet.  3. She NEVER removed a dish when we were done with our meal. We had four dinner plates, bread plates, appetizer plates, refilled and empty drink glasses and of course peanut buckets stacked on our table after we finished and had paid and she came back and told us thanks and dropped off the receipt. All the dishes were left on the table and we had to leave just to get away from the mess on the table as we could not sit and finish our iced tea.  4. While people were walking out of the place a male employee, who went to great lengths to let you know he is homosexual ( I have no problem with him being homosexual just putting it here so management can identify who I'm talking about) comes walking down the aisle with nothing in his hands and makes every customer stop and step aside for him as he struts down the aisle. He would not stop and get out of the customers way. I watched him continue to do it the entire time we were there so when I went to walk out I purposely didn't get out of his way and continued walking down the aisle and he got right in my face and said \"excuse me\" and stood there until I moved out of his way. He caught me off guard as I was sure he would move aside as I pushed forward but he wasn't about to let me through so out of embarrassment from his saying loudly \"excuse me\" I moved for him.  The food was good and a manager stopped by shortly after our arrival and I wished it would have been further into the meal so I could have let her know of the issues. When we were done we just wanted to get out of there and away from the table and all the dishes (and rib bones) stacked in front of us."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here over several years. Usually, it takes a forklift to roll me out of this place. I stick with the fall-off-the-bone ribs, but others I've dined with enjoyed their steaks, chicken, and even fish. Good choice of sides, with baked potato and green beans being my go to veggies. Unlimited rolls with cinnamon butter plus free peanuts can equal full before you get your meal so ration yourself. They'll give you a to go box of rolls for free if you ask politely. The service has always been decent to great depending on the day. The faster the tables turn over, the more they make, so slow your servers roll if you want to take your time. It's a popular place, so expect a wait on the weekend or during the week if there is an event in town. The noise level can get pretty raucous at times, especially in the open bar area, so come earlier if that bothers you. Overall, great place to go if you like well cooked meat and can't grill out."}
{"text":"Steak way too done when I went last week.   Went back last night and gave them a second chance. The steak was perfect and service was outstanding. I will go there again. It was a Sunday night again and they were packed!"}
{"text":"Have not eaten here. Originally posted but experience was at another Texas Roadhouse. Have this one my average for all TRs."}
{"text":"Great food and service every time I come. My only issue is something minor always seems to happen to us every time we come that prolongs our meals."}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying, that the food is terrific!!! There is no doubt about that. The steak is always cooked exactly how it is ordered, and the chicken is nice and juicy. Not to mention, I would probably come here just for the bread and cinnamon butter if I could. LOL. If it wasn't for the poor service I would definitely have given this place a 5 Star rating. The hostesses are extremely rude when you first arrive. As a matter of fact the first time I came to Texas Roadhouse I almost left because they acted as if they could not be bothered by me. I went again last night for dinner, and the hostess gave us our number, and then told us it would show up on the board when our table was ready.. my stepmom and I went and found a seat directly in front of the board and literally watched it like a hawk (because of our extreme hunger) and our number never showed up. After about 45mins, we went up to the host station where the hostess rudely told us that she called our number on the loud speaker even if it didn't show up on the board. . . First of all this would not be such an issue if we were not sitting directly in front of the hostess station the entire time, and if the restaurant was not so loud because then you would be able to actually hear what is or is not being said over the microphone. So after that mix up the hostess tells us there is a table available if we would like, we are then escorted to a table in the bar (which is first come first serve regardless).  Needless to say that put a sour taste in my mouth. When you come here expect good food, and ok service. Our actual waitress was great, but the hostesses are the face of the restaurant and should really be aware of how they treat customers."}
{"text":"Love Texas Roadhouse. They have consistent, flavorful, food. I know when I come here I am going to leave happy and full. I switch it up between the shrimp and the filet. All entrees come with two sides and those delicious, pillowy rolls. Who I am kidding ? I go here for the rolls and cinnamon butter. SO GOOD. Also, I always get the Caesar salad and mashed potatoes with white gravy."}
{"text":"We go to the Texas Roadhouse off 83rd in Peoria. Great restaurant with good service and cute girls. Always polite even when there slammed. Love the fresh baked rolls and honey butter. Ice cold beer and peanuts . If you're looking for a good steak then check this place. Great steaks to choose from and never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"So I live a hop, skip, and a jump away from this joint. I usually love it because the staff is very kind and helpful. I took my niece there last night for her birthday. From jump, my waiter was being a smarty pants. When our food finally came out, the fries were ice cold and there were literally 7 fries in the basket.. So I kindly told him to get us some fresh ones and hopefully a few more. Not even one minute later, he brings back, I kid you not, the same basket.. I'm like umm sir these are the same. He looks flustered and says he's going to tell his manager so she can get it taken care of. Seriously, your guys' specialty isn't fries. Fries are pretty simple. So some time later, the manager comes out with it. By the time we received the fresh fries, we were all done eating. When he brought me the check, I asked him what my niece gets for a birthday type deal and he says ice cream and walks away. I was like wow, he just doesn't like us anymore. I swear to you we weren't being rude at all. I have been to this location a number of times. Needless to say, I probably won't come back for a while."}
{"text":"I think our waiter either didn't see us or ignored us, we had to ask another server to get us our waiter. I could see afterwards he tried his best to make up for it. Other than that, always loved the food here and it came out quickly. Hostesses were nice"}
{"text":"Well bread was good with the cinnamon butter! We had a coupon from our hotel so decided to have a steak. Yelp Ck in got a blooming onion for free. Wow too much.. Lol. Then our salads. I had Cesar and the boy regular with 1000. Now he ate half his salad and said to taste the dressing ... Lol it was the blooming onion sauce! Lmao. Definatly horseradish for sure!! When someone came around we mentioned that and she went in back to check. Yup! Someone mixed the 1000 and onion sauce together in the labeled 1000 bottle in the kitchen!!! She apologized and said she had to throw it away. Well duh..  Then our rib eye came with vegis. One med rare and other medium. Well mine was good and hubbys was too done ( was to be med rare). So fortunately the wait staff DOES come by 4-5 times during dinner and checks on you!! He had the cook make another steak. I told one to give us a smaller steak cause he did eat some but they insisted we take it home for later. So he ate a few bites and got it to go.  Now I thought the steaks were a bit salty.. So I think it may be awhile till we come back. But the staff there is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Tonight before going to the movies, Danielle and I went to Texas Roadhouse for dinner.  The place was packed but we were seated very quickly and enjoyed some of those fresh baked buns w/ the cinnamon butter. Unfortunately, I'm a fat ass and the booths are really cramped and i wasn't comfortable throughout dinner.  Danielle had the BBQ grilled chicken dinner w/ vegetables and a salad. Sadly, her vegetables were raw. She liked the rest of her meal, though.  I had the country fried chicken dinner w/ a baked potato and corn. My dinner was great. Absolutely no complaints The food was delicious. Sadly, i wasn't very hungry at the time. But hey, now i have some leftovers for tomorrow.  Check this place out if you're in the area. I was surprised how much I liked it."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times in the last 6 months, every time had attentive, friendly service and good food. It's usually busy during peak hours so expect a wait. But the last time I was in the wait was quoted as an hour so my companion and I luckily found open seats at the bar. Two bartenders plus a bar back did a great job keeping everyone serviced with the full menu as well as drinks despite the crowd. You get complimentary peanuts and can drop the shells on the floor or wherever, the kids get a kick out of this. My only real complaints are that the place can get really loud, and I wasn't a huge fan of the ribs. They were tender, but I prefer mine with dry rub and sauce on the side. The ribs here come slathered in a VERY sweet sauce. Not bad per se, but I won't order them again. I recommend the ribeye....It's always well seasoned and cooked just the way it's ordered."}
{"text":"Thank you Erica L for a great first TR experience! She was amazingly friendly and helpful.  My very picky eater of a son loved Fresh rolls with cinnamon butter The kids steak The ribs (he ate mine) Steak fries *not a fan of the corn because he tasted pepper  He adored being able to shuck the peanuts and put them in the floor.  He also got a kick out of watching the staff dance to cotton eyed joe. I loved that my very tasty frozen sangria margarita  was very reasonably priced at $7 He just asked to have his bday dinner here lol!"}
{"text":"I've always loved this chain, but this particular location is super busy. The wait for a table is super long and they are always out of prime ribs by 7 on the weekend. How about make more for \"night eaters\"? I don't understand why they hired too many hostesses (3-4) in the front for when they never tells you the approximate waiting time correctly. I do expect to come in within 20 mins if you tell me that, not 40-50 mins."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a solid 3.5 stars. Great meat. Ribs are delicious. Very fast an efficient service! Waited less than 10 minutes for my food. Points taken off for the side dishes. Mac n Cheese is very obviously Kraft from a box, green beans and corn from a can. Sweet potato was pretty good. Rolls are bomb."}
{"text":"Great service great food.  Love this chain and I normally don't like chains."}
{"text":"Their ribs just comes off the bone effortlessly.  It's so awesome.  The bread is also super tasty.  Love love going there!"}
{"text":"Why have I never been here before! Omg the steaks (ribeye specifically) was so soft and yummy...you don't even need steak sauce. It was cooked perfectly. Also...the ribs were pretty yummy as well! I ordered the Texas size combos with ribeye and ribs and buttered corn and seasoned rice. Sides were def disappointing tho. The buttered corn was too salty and so was the rice. My family ordered ceasar salad and they loved that. And I guess I'm goin backwards but the cinnamon butter and hotrolls are bombdiggity...yup J just said bombdiggity! Lol I had like three rolls which filled me up plus I had the frozen margarita...soooo good! I came in a large cup and I finished it all! I obviously didn't have enough room for my food...but no matter because I will eat it for lunch :) two for one!   This is a really great place to eat...4 stars for the atmostphere, the service, steaks, rolls and cinnamon butter, and the yummy margarita.  2.5 for the sides though.  All in all a great experience so they get a 3.5!!! And def will come back again!"}
{"text":"Went here on Mother's day. They had great specials, prime rib was good, cheese fries are the best around. Large portions, great service, love the juke box! This is the first time I ordered prime rib here. Not as good as the ribs, they have the best ribs, but the prime rib was a solid 4!"}
{"text":"Literally had a dead fly in our salad. Informed the server \"Becks\" and she was apologetic and said the manager would be right over. Didn't see her for a while. Had to ask other servers for refills and to clear off the plates (didn't eat the other salads). She was there however to drop off the check and expect her tip (party of 8). I still tip 20% of the bill but that was the worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday night and was actually pretty busy. I hadn't been to a Texas Roadhouse for years, but I was glad to be back to one. The menu hadn't changed much, which to me is a good sign. They must be doing something right all these years. Service was good, atmosphere was lively (there were two birthday parties happening while I was there). Ordered the 20oz bone-in ribeye and it was phenomenal. Would return."}
{"text":"A gift card brought us in, although my daughter has often raved about this place. The prices were excellent. The portions were generous. The food was delicious. I had catfish. My husband had the sirloin steak. We both left full and happy. The server was amazing. The manager stopped by our table to see how we were doing. The one thing that might keep us from returning is that it is very, very loud, particularly when there is a birthday. Otherwise, this Roadhouse is a keeper."}
{"text":"One of the best steak places in the western suburbs!  You can watch the chefs grill your steaks as you wait.  A great place for families.  We usually make reservations.  Food I'd delicious!  Especially their bread and honey butter.  Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here before flying out of the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport as the airport doesn't have a lot of facilities yet. This place is just 2 minutes from the airport terminal.  Watched an NFL playoff game while munching on some potato skins. The skins weren't the best, but they weren't the worst either. Being exhausted from just running in the the AZ RnR Marathon, I had to pass on a beer on this visit...but really wanted one. Complimentary peanuts are given to you by the bucket-full...you just throw the shells on the ground!  If you need a place to kill some time, down some brews, watch sports, and eat before you fly out, I highly recommend you stop here! I'll be back on my next trip."}
{"text":"Not up to my usual experience. Restaurant was not full.  They had an abundance of greeters, they could have put to better service helping get food. Out.  It was cold and when I opened the blind to let the sun in the manager was very rude and came and closed them.  This place had better wake up before they lose all their customers .  I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Friday night and the place was packed!  65 minute wait was kinda frustrating - but our server, Tori, was fantastic - timing, drink check, apps timely and meals were spot on!  She was the best server we have had in years.   Texas Roadhouse - good food and great service!"}
{"text":"The food was good.  However, the music was so loud we couldn't hear friends across the table.  It was not a pleasant dining experience and we ate and left quickly.  Which could be what they were wanting, since the place was very crowded. Visited 12/27 approx 6pm."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great waitress.  Love how they sit with ya like you are old friends while taking orders...super casual and down home....no stuck up and pretentious wait staff here.  I love to see them dance in the aisles and enjoy their jobs.  The wait staff made sure everything was just perfect.  Great eveninf, by far."}
{"text":"I love going here when our family comes to town. My dad and my brothers go here together several times a year for guys night. The portions have always been plentiful and the free bread and peanuts are generous. The ribs and steak dinners are what we come for everytime."}
{"text":"This place is great. Erica was our server and added to our great experience. She kept our drinks full and brought our delicious food in a timely manner. 5 stars."}
{"text":"We always enjoy the food and atmosphere at TR. Kallah was an excellent waitress. The call ahead seating service is so convenient not sure why others haven't adopted it in our locality."}
{"text":"Went in this past Thursday night. We love this place because the food is good, reasonably priced and, oh yeah, the bread and sweet butter. This last time service was even better than normal. Shout out to Jared for his great customer service. He even offered my friend and son to-go sodas. Next time I visit I will be requesting him."}
{"text":"We came here for a post-Christmas family dinner after some shopping at the mall. This restaurant has been open for about 3 weeks now; we normally go to the one in Greensburg. The wait time provided to us was pretty accurate. We were told 25 minutes, and we were seated within 30 minutes. The waiting area could be a little bigger as I'm pretty sure the Greensburg one is.   Naturally, we ordered the Cactus Blossom, and it was amazing. Crunchy battered-covered onions with zesty horseradish sauce! We saw other tables order the potato skins which looked super tasty as well. While the rolls and honey butter were good, we could've used more butter but we made it work. My sister ordered a strawberry margarita ($9.25) that I finished off, and it was fantastic! I ordered the steak and shrimp combo ($17.99). The shrimp was so full of flavor and spice. However, I asked for my steak well done and it still had pink inside. I was too full to eat it anyway so I packed it up to further cook at home.   Our waitress was very friendly and on top of things. Before my dad even finished his strawberry lemonade, she brought out another. Well worth the $2.99! I must admit that I was disheartened when our waitress mentioned that they could not take lunch breaks or eat at the restaurant during their shifts due to the busyness. I'm a firm believer in taking care of your employees.   Other than the couple things that I mentioned, we enjoyed our meal at the new Texas Roadhouse in Monroeville."}
{"text":"We went really really early to avoid the dinner rush and it worked.  I really like their steaks and think they are great.  This night I had the 11 oz sirloin and ordered a side of ribs too.  The steak was good and the ribs were yummy.  The meat fell off the bones like the lady said.  The food was good and the service was great too.  I like this place and will just go during off hours so I do not have to wait."}
{"text":"I will start off saying that I like this place.   We have eaten here a few times and do not understand why the reviews are the way they are.  I work in construction and understand that shit happens.  The same applies to every business in this world.  It is how the business responds to that shit happening that makes them or breaks them.  I think now people are expecting so much instant gratification it leads to unfair judgments and calls.    We stopped by here on Friday night.  I was looking to have a good sirloin.  I ordered the sirloin with green beans.  My better half did the sirloin with a baked potato.  My sirloin came out the way I asked for it medium.  My better half's came out pretty much well done.  They apologized and started to make another one.  The next one that came out was almost rare.  The head honcho came over and apologized and took care of it for us. The next sirloin came out medium like she likes.  I understand most people would have freaked out and started to throw a fit.  Me growing up the way I did.  If a cook messes up a couple of steaks and that is the worse thing that happens.  I can care less.    I like this place and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"It was good. I had the 16oz Rib Eye steak. It was very flavorful. I was there on a busy night but everything was fast. The service was good.  Overall it was a good experience. I only gave four stars because it wasn't a great experience."}
{"text":"I've fallen in love with their pickle chips & mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"As a regular customer at the Texas Roadhouse establishments, I was not pleased with the service that I received this evening. We happily came to celebrate my sisters 18th birthday, but our night was ruined by a balding, 25 year old male, who looked like Francis from Pee-wee's Big Adventure (not an exaggeration). He threw napkins and straws at us if it was hay and we were a herd of cattle being fed for the day and when we kindly complained to the service manager, she said, \"I'll do the best I can to fix his mistakes, and will give y'all a different waiter\". When we told \"Francis\" (real name Chop, I know right?) he was not our waiter anymore, he shouted out in glee, \"yay! that is AWESOME!!!!\". We were sat at a booth that did not fit my party, so a chair was added to the end of the table. This gave an opportunity for the vulgar waiter and his friends to rudely bump into my aunt, and slightly spill water on her. This made us to take it up to James, the general manager, and he told us, \"do you want to stay here, or want me to throw you out. I have the best servers in the world, and if I saw anyone of them do that, they would be FIRED on the spot\". We told him we'll just enjoy the bread and cinnamon butter, with his red, flustered, sweaty face that gave the look of disgust and walked away. If my sister was not craving a 20 oz prime rib (which they did not have) we would have left, but we stayed because she also wanted a steak. Jordan, a nice girl, who looks like she is going to gain a pharmacy degree and a 4.0 GPA was then assigned as our waitress. Not once did she hesitate with our request, if James would show leadership, I would have gave 5 stars just for Jordan! when it came time to say the famous \"YEEEHAAAW\" for birthday guest, Jordan was the ONLY one who came and announced the birthday. I have the snapchats to prove it. Jordan was the only server who met our needs and went above and beyond with everything she did. Jordan exudes success and she should be promoted."}
{"text":"we were visiting from Hawaii, so of course it's our first time here & I assure you it won't be the last! our waitress (I think her name was Chelsie) gave us great customer service! Even the mgr came to our table to welcome us! The food was superb! In fact, we couldn't even finish them because the the portions were huge! The employees even did some line dancing. I could see some patrons didn't care for it, but it was entertaining for us given the fact we don't see that back at home. I would've given 5-stars but the only down fall was it was a bit loud. Nothing too dramatic. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Called three times because I was hung up on the first two. The third time I was on hold long enough for me to drive down here. I was told my order of rolls would only be a minute to wrap up. Ten minutes later and they're helping the people in line after me. She went and got their food first and checked them out. Meanwhile I see my rolls boxed up waiting but not in a bag. She went and got the rolls and disappeared for awhile and then came out and rang me up. I'm really hoping she didn't do something to them. Instead of saying thank you have a nice day she rang me up and then ignored me and answered the phone. I'm huge on customer service. I understand they're busy and I would be waiting to place my order. To help the people after me and purposely take longer though is not ok. To hang up because they don't want to deal with it is not ok."}
{"text":"Just finished a terrific meal with the BEST server, Michael!! Thanks for the extraordinary service and great personality. He made the food taste even better!  As for the food, excellent!"}
{"text":"Their ranch dressing is like God's saliva. This place shits on outback"}
{"text":"I did read some not so great reviews but we decided to give this place a chance and I'm glad we did.  We got seated right away (it was a Monday).  I liked that you could see all the different cuts of meat as you walked in.  The bread and cinnamon honey butter is to die for! (We had 3 baskets!!!)  They also have on the table a container full of peanuts.  I got a house salad, my kids ceasar salads and the hubby a cup of chili.  All tasted great.  We ordered prime rib, rib eye, sirloin & shrimp and pork chops.  Everyone loved their steaks.  My pork chop was super juicy.  Our waiter was nice and constantly came by to check on us.  Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Only giving it a one star because of a server named Teresa although she was not even our waitress she filled our drinks and , she brought our food out after it sat in the window for about 3-5 minutes, (not her job). I have to explain this is after we walked right in, were seated right across from the kitchen waited 10 minutes and no one approached us offered us drinks, acknowledged us or anything. My husband finally asked one of the girls near the door if we had a waitress I think her name was Jen, she brought us more bread apologized and found our waitress that said she was stuck in the back or she would have helped us sooner. Yeah that excuse would have worked had I not seen her walk by multiple times and never acknowledge us. She then spent 10-15 minutes chatting up another table, and never came to see if the food was ok until we were halfway done eating. Good thing someone else grabbed our food out of the window. I also have to say I don't appreciate the cussing, loud yelling and immaturity coming from the girls going in and out of the back. Again the only one I really saw busting a hump Teresa,  cleaning tables,etc. Not sure I will go back to this one again, some of the food was cold, and well the service leaves a lot to be desired. I am not sure where the manager was but if he or she was there I would have liked to have spoke to them if our waitress didn't point out her huge son that worked there , it made me nervous.."}
{"text":"They are super nice and the food is great! I love coming here. I'm always treated well and enjoy my dining experience."}
{"text":"Our waitress was great here! And she was so sweet to our baby, kept bringing her stuff out! And the food was delish!"}
{"text":"I found myself (alone) searching for somewhere to grab lunch, in a town I'm not familiar with and while my phone was dying. We have Texas Roadhouse in my town (Boise, ID) but I have yet to try it, so I figured I would give it a shot.   When I walked in, they were in the middle of a line dance. I love this kind of atmosphere! I was seated quickly (after they were done dancing) and my waitress welcomed me shortly after. I let her know I had never been in, so she sat down at my table and went over the menu with me - which I appreciated.  The hostess brought rolls and butter when she seated me, so I went ahead and dove in while I was pondering the menu. The cinnamon butter was a great touch, and was perfectly sweet. I could tell the rolls would be good.. If mine hasn't been overlooked. The tops were brown and hard. Frankly, I was surprised they served them. But, I peeled off the top and went with it. What was left was airy, slightly sweet, and perfectly carb-a-liscious.   I went with a favorite of mine - Country Fried Chicken and cream gravy, with a side of loaded mashed potatoes and apple sauce. (I find it neat you can order applesauce as a side!) My waitress asked if I wanted the steak topped with anything, so of course I went with sautéed onions!   When my food finally came, I realized my eyes had been much bigger than my stomach. Very big portions!   The chicken was okay, but the breaking kept falling off and the chicken itself was bland. The breaking was okay. The gravy was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. And the onions... Oh the onions. First off, I'm an onion lover! But there had to be nearly a whole onion on top of my dish, which was over the top and left the dish filled with the taste of onion (rather than complimenting it). Second, the onions weren't nearly sautéed enough. More than half of them were still perfectly white and crunchy. I was not pleased to find nearly raw onions overbearing my dish.   The mashed potatoes were really good, along with the toppings, but they could have scaled it back with the cheese. I couldn't see anything under the yellow/orange blockade, so my first bit was nearly all butter.   The applesauce was okay, but clearly just something out of a jar. I was actually expecting homemade. (And would have loved for it to have been hot.)   My strawberry lemonade was okay, but was just some syrup mixed with fountain lemonade. Would have loved to see real strawberries.   Maybe I'm picky when it comes to places like this, but I was spoiled to grow up going to The Original Roadhouse in Salem, Oregon - which blows this place out of the water.   I don't plan on checking out my local one anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want to go out and have a steak.  We don't eat out a lot, so when we do, I want it to be good and worth the money.   We got there, and had to wait a few minutes for a table.  Not a problem. The hostess that took us to the table was friendly and brought the warm basket of rolls with her.  She smiled a lot and was very nice. The waitress gave us good service.  Can't really fault her for that. My hubby and I both ordered a sirloin.  the waitress said it was one of their most popular things.  Both of us ordered medium.  We both found the steak dry and mealy.  I guess that is what you get for 12$.  We also got the onion appetizer, which was very salty and seemed to have been ready to go before we ordered it. We got baked potatoes, loaded, which were tasty.  But why does loaded cost extra? Is the menu price for a dry potato?  It does not say on the menu what you are getting with it.  And the steak, we both got fried mushrooms (more$) and my husband got onions (more$) that were not really even fried.  Still white. Overall, the bill came to 45$.  That is a lot of little add-ons.  We had iced tea for drinks.  Just disappointing that you go to a place that prides themselves on their hand-cut steaks, and these were that bad.  And all the little things they add on....... just too much.   Next time, I'll just go somewhere that is a little more pricey and has a better steak.  Oh, and the busboy clearing tables around us was clearing like a petulant child who was being punished.  Made things a little noisy, even over the loud country music. If he doesn't \"heart\" his job, like his shirt said, maybe he should stay home."}
{"text":"For the price a good place to visit. Our waitress chandler was friendly and pleasant. But when we checked our silverware we had to replace because they weren't exactly clean. After that the food came quickly and hot. Great marinate on the chicken. Will return"}
{"text":"Food was good but it was the service that made the experience great. Our server Asia was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Ate there last night. Everyone in the party loved their food. Crowded, but wait was less than they estimated. Service was excellent. Been disappointed in Gilbert restaurants in general, but we will go back to this one. Dinner salads mostly iceberg lettuce or would have been five stars."}
{"text":"I find myself torn on the case of Texas Roadhouse. I've been coming here with my family for a long, long time. the best thing on the menu? Chicken critters... The most important ingredient in those chicken critters? Nostalgia. Now, there's only three reasons a grown man orders chicken tenders. 1. He's low on cash and it's the only thing on the menu he can afford(except a salad, but who wants that?) 2. He's at a restaurant such as Chick-Fil-A or Raising Canes(but mostly Chick-Fil-A) that specializes in chicken tenders 3. He's overflowing with so much nostalgia, he can't think straight. If number 3 is the case, it's advisable, and completely appropriate to grab him by the collar and slap him with a steak. Unfortunately, you won't find a steak worthy of slapping your fellow comrade with at this Roadhouse. If you find yourself in search of a good cup of chili, sure! head that way. You want some amazing rolls, have at it! Even their ribs are fine. If you're searching for a place to get a cheap steak and you don't mind the noisy, cluttered atmosphere, look no further. But for me, I've come to terms with my chicken critter nostalgia, and it's high time I put it to rest."}
{"text":"We stopped here on Tuesday 4-11 for dinner.  We had dined here on a number of occasions in the past.  As usual, the steak was very tasty and cooked perfectly to our specifications.    This time the best part of our visit was our server Reydean.  She was smiling, friendly and engaging.  Even took the time to chat with us for just a few minutes.  We told her this was our 25th Anniversary (it was) but we did not want any of the usual fanfare, just to have a nice dinner.  I think she wanted to make something of it but acquiesced to our wishes and we left happy and full.  Thanks for a great experience Reydean !!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying our server Jo was amazing! She had a good attitude , super friendly, and did everything possible for us to have a good dining experience. The food was steak and burger cooked to perfection. The bread and butter. Outstanding!!! Jo kept us stocked with our soft drinks and the yummy rolls with the great tasting butter.. She even gave us some of those to take home. We will definately be back."}
{"text":"Somebody in my party mentioned it was my birthday, the waitress asked if I wanted them to come and sing happy birthday to me, I said \"No, please do not do that.\" But they didn't listen, they came over and did it anyways. I wanted to jump out of my skin. I honestly tried to crawl under the table to get the heck out of there.  I don't even remember if I liked the food or not."}
{"text":"My entire family loves this place. The food is great! The wait can be long espically Friday and Saturday so make sure you have extra time."}
{"text":"I've had a couple good experiences here in the past three or four weeks.  But today my rack of ribs had no sauce.   And I did not get a refill on my iced tea.  I left thinking I had somehow offended or inconvenienced the establishment.  But now I'm half convinced that when you go to Texas Roadhouse, make sure and tell 'em it's your first visit.  Now that was good chow."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant at this location.. Awesome service,  Amazing Food, & their Armadillo Punch is SPECTACULAR!!!! Overall, a fun, full & great experience!"}
{"text":"Came for Veterans Day lunch. VERY busy but the staff remained pleasant and in control. Food was on par for roadhouse which I say is good for a chain on such a crazy day."}
{"text":"I came in to eat at the bar.  The service was excellent from both bartenders, I ordered the sixteen ounce ribeye medium rare, it was perfectly cooked side, bread and salad were excellent.  Can't beat it for the price."}
{"text":"Called ahead due to celebrate sons graduation with family.. They were so not understanding 2 people( the graduates were parking their car) 2 minutes past our time to be seated.. They came in and we were told our table was given up, I explained my older mom felt faint from the sun and they still wouldn't seat us..  I was appalled at company policy they kept saying as they will not seat anyone without entire party there at check in.. no flexibility nor customer service.. We took our business elsewhere and will never return to a company that doesn't put their customers first.. A huge disappointment on my sons graduation.. shame on you!!!"}
{"text":"Always love the dinner rolls. Always love the Caesar salad. Always love the corn. Our waitress was on top of things. Will be going back a lot!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience!  Called and was told no wait, was there in under 10 minutes and told it was a 5-15 min wait.  Waited 40 minutes and went to see why and they said sorry, we have a table open you can take.  Someone who just walked in was standing by us and her device started flashing and they gave her the table!  They need to get it together, really very poorly managed restaurant!  We left!"}
{"text":"The star deduction is for the fat and gristle in my Porterhouse Steak.  Flavor was great just had to discard more of it than I could've imagined due to excessive fat and gristle, which is really a shame.  Server Kristin was great.  Everything was kicked out in a timely manner, and tasted great, again with the exception of the aforementioned issue with my steak.  I would definitely return to this location.  Texas Roadhouse is about a twice a year treat for me, and usually never disappoints.  Fun, fair priced restaurant that has been a major success story over the years!  Tremendous Volume, and as a result call ahead seating is always recommended."}
{"text":"My experience with my husband was decent. The food, restaurant and service was decent. Why am I giving this a 5 star rating then? The hospitality was amazing. The hostess, Grace, that welcomed me was so kind and accommodating that she full on made the experience worth it."}
{"text":"okay okay okay, so I'm pretty sure the last time I went to a Texas Roadhouse I was still eating off of the kids menu, so I wasn't expecting anything. I know the place is new and so again, I wasn't expecting great customer service and amazing food and a server who was so completely attentive and darling that I'm coming back solely to be served by him (okay and the fried pickles... do you guys have Togo?) his name was Carlos L I believe,, my friends and I are a rowdy crowd (okay there was only three of us but really we can be annoying) but he was sweet and never let our drinks get low or our bread stay empty, he had the best recommendations and I loved the atmosphere- the dancing was amazing! I work in norterra so I can easily see this becoming a spot of mine- thank you so much for the experience!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go tonight. Food was delicious as always and service was great. There is no doubt the wait times to dine in can be long and even the wait times to place a take out order can be lengthy also, but truly worth the wait! Thank you Texas Roadhouse for making my family one amazing dinner tonight!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for dinner on a Saturday at 5pm.  It was already crazy busy so we put our name down and settled in for the wait which ended up being about 20 minutes.  They send you a text when your table is ready which is nice so folks can wait in their car instead of standing around the lobby. Our waitress was attentive and food came out in a reasonable amount of time despite it being so busy.  Table was clean and neat but I wish they could figure out how to clean the menus on a more regular basis so they aren't so sticky. Our steaks were cooked perfectly and the sides were yummy.  Husband and I had a nice dinner without the kids."}
{"text":"There is always a long wait on the weekends, however, you have barrels of peanuts to curb your appetite until you are seated. Once seated, you are brought a bucket of yummy rolls and drink order comes out quick. The steaks are reasonably priced, but lack a little flavor. Would come back."}
{"text":"Simply a great place but tonight at the Concord Mills location didn't cut it!  I'm so sad because I was so READY for steak! To Roadhouses credit the waitress was GREAT and she's not the cook. Half eaten steak and soggy grease fries I leave disappointed."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick, inexpensive, sit down meal on a week night... go here! We each had an entree with two sides and a tall beer for $38 (3 people)! I prefer Logan's roadhouse, but Texas is good too. Service was OK - nothing phenomenal or out of the ordinary. I really dislike how hostesses anymore have their big phones hanging out of their back pockets. Who is going to call them while they're working?"}
{"text":"tons of food for the price.  But both of our meats were BURNT!  :(  Staff was friendly, atmosphere was nice.  The YEE-HAWS kinda sucked...and I'm from Texas!  lol   I would go back but definitely will watch for burnt meat and make them re-fire them."}
{"text":"Very crowded the night I went and there were quite a number of birthday parties going on where you sit on this saddle and the employees sing happy birthday to you.  That was a \"fun\" environment, but unfortunately the food was not even close to par.  My steak was quite fatty and the sauce/marinade totally overwhelmed the prime rib.  My buddy got a ribeye but it looked more like ribeye's scrawny step brother that hasn't been fed for a week."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great place to take your family. My experience here was excellent. We were seated right away and our waitress was genuinely polite and made sure everything was great. Everyone in my family was very pleased with their food and we had no problems whatsoever. I would recommed this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Texas Roadhouse for lunch a couple of days ago. I must say it was one of the best experiences of my life. The staff was efficient and polite. The food was without question one of the best meals I have ever eaten. I can't say enough about how happy we both were. If the atmosphere had been a little,no a lot more elaborate we would have felt like we were in a five star restaurant. I will recommend this place to everyone. The price was very reasonable and you couldn't ask for a better meal."}
{"text":"Johnny Football!!!!!!! Whoops, sorry I thought this was facebook for a second. Typically my experiences here meet my expectations. However, my order tonight tasted like Christmas tree ornaments (or something like that). The country fried steak was more fried than steak (IF YA KNOW WHATIMEAN). Also, we were shorted on our rolls. Does no one in the kitchen have a calculator? Or a rubix cube (that's not related, just wondering)?  Ok! Thanks for your time! YELP!"}
{"text":"I like to come here every once in a while when I'm wanting a nice big prime rib. We went the day before valentines day and did the call ahead for our seats. So happy we did! We did a valentines day special which was 40 dollars for a cactus bloom and shrimp, side salad and two 12 oz steaks. It was soo yummy and we had a good time. The service was fast and friendly. Will def be going back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here this evening, we both were impressed! Great service, great atmosphere, great prices.  It was dinner time and we had a twenty minute wait, so we jumped on a bar stool and enjoyed a margarita..we were then seated at a booth, very comfortable  booth.  The rolls were delicious with the cinnamon butter.  We were waited on promptly by a very friendly waitress.  Our food was delivered HOT, which is hard to get nowadays.  The manager dropped by our table to see how our meal was.  Once we told her this was our first visit, she left and came back with a sac of peanuts, with coupons for a free appetizer for our next visit.  Oh the music was great as well..we will certainly return in the very near future."}
{"text":"We arrived at 513 and still had to wait 55 mins for a table.We got the onion blossom and was burnt with another waiter helping our table.our water glasses were empty twice and had to ask for service. When steak came the waitress never came back to make sure it was satisfactory. Don't k ow here name but she was a real low talker. Bad experience, get good help or I will not be back."}
{"text":"The last few times we have enjoyed  coming to Texas roadhouse but tonight I am sad to say the service we are receiving as I write this is substandard. First order a beer and asked for with a cold mug and orange. Received bottle of beer only until 5 min later when the server Kristen came and asked if we wanted to order yet. We put in for the sampler appetizer with no ranch only  blue cheese. It came out with only ranch and as we looked at it 2 of the the rattlesnake bites had been overcooked and all the filling came out. So we waited and waited and waited 15 minutes before Kristen came back to check on us and we told her about the issues with the snakebites she said Oh well, but she did endup bringing us our bluecheese. So now we are waiting for our main dishes with hopes of better service. As for right now Texas Roadhouse service or I should say server is truly lacking. We will ore than likely be back because 2 little boys love the small steaks they get but I am very disappointed thus far and we are not even to the main course."}
{"text":"Tonight was by far the worst experience I've ever had at Texas Roadhouse. We were sat at a table rather quickly, but it all went downhill from there. It took 20 minutes to get our appetizer and then our meal, well that's a different story. We literally sat for over an hour until our food finally showed up. Then, to top it off, I ordered my ribeye medium and it showed up like it was cut off the cow and seared and thrown on a plate. Now mind you, I usually get my steak medium-rare, but this steak was ice cold in the middle and still bleeding. I actually wondered if it was going to get up and walk off my plate. The ribs however were way overdone, the only reason they fell off the bone is because they were so charred and dry. The service from our server was also way subpar as well. Sadly people that came in after us were seated, ate their food and were out the door before we received our meals. Definitely will not be returning there anytime soon. If I could give them 0 stars I definitely would."}
{"text":"Great Texas Roadhouse BBQ in Phoenix!  I ordered the Chicken BBQ with mashed potatoes and corn and it was DELICIOUS!!!  Very friendly staff, knowledgable and helpful. I was helped by both Alicia and Desiree and they were super friendly and sweet and very professional.    It's also good for families.  I highly recommend this place !"}
{"text":"I love this place. I could almost just go for the warm rolls with cinnamon butter (I know, that sounds stupid but just you wait).  I personally really like the ceasar salad there. I like lots of dressing and TR does this well.   If yelp got with the program this place would get a 4.5/5 star rating."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on Saturday. The fried catfish dinner was very good. Had the house salad; good as well. The hot rolls here are always nice. Service was excellent. I wish they were open on weekdays for lunch."}
{"text":"Sara did an outstanding job as our server.Very professional, polite, quick to get anything you need.awesome experience."}
{"text":"Loving this restaurant, the host, server/waitress were so cordial and friendly. The food was great and really affordable. A lot for your money. Let's see, I started with boneless wings as my appetizer. Then I ordered pulled pork sandwich, & small chilli and salad. NICE!"}
{"text":"The food is what you expect from a chain restaurant. Mediocre at best but our server Emily was outstanding. She saved this place from a 2 star review.  Extremely attentive and genuine, she made an otherwise meh experience a whole lot better."}
{"text":"Food and service is consistently great. Rolls are a pillowy sweet delight with every bite. The salad is topped with real eggs and the house made French dressing has just the right spice. Mushroom chickens (both portobello and the smothered with button mushrooms) are favorites. The ribeye is good too. Sweet tea is a staple. Servers are friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner and the place started slow but filled up pretty quick.  I ordered the pork chop and my wife ordered the chicken fried steak.  Both were very good, but a warning, the pork chops were brined which made them very juicy but also VERY salty.  Sides were also good, but it was the service by DEREK that really stood out. DEREK went out of his way to provide top notch service.  The food gets 4 stars but DEREK gets 6!"}
{"text":"Great food, Great service, got the 16 oz sirloin, you don't need no steak sauce, just a great, tender steak! Our server, Vanessa, was very attentive and took great care of us!"}
{"text":"2nd time I have been to this place and both times my steak was cooked so wrong the waitress said wow that rare. Sorry I will not be back for a 3rd time ever again!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Love the peanuts that you can throw on the floor. Good menu choices. I always get the steak, but last time I got the chicken critters. SO much food and they were delicious :-) Had lunch for the next two days with my left overs. Husband got the pulled pork sandwich which he also enjoyed. Will return for more... :)"}
{"text":"i ordered the bbq babby back ribs. i was sort of dissappointed...basically oven baked with some too sweet sauce poured over the top..i expected more."}
{"text":"The food was GREAT! The waiter in my area was super awesome and attentive. The waitress that served my table was absolutely RUDE! Her name was Brie. I asked her if she could get the plates out of the way so I had space for my food and as I handed the plates to her, not only did she not say a word, she snatched them out of my hand. Next time I go here I will make sure that I do not get her as my server. I was not happy with the service I was given."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is great for a dependable family option.  Though my kids are generally very well behaved when we are out to eat, I don't have to worry about getting the stink-eye from a neighboring table when our toddle shrieks with excitement about something.  We are early diners, so we don't often have to worry about crowds. But I highly recommend the call ahead option if you want to eat there during prime time.    Texas Roadhouse is known for their freshly baked rolls and the sweetened butter they serve with them- always a hit.  I alternate between the roasted chicken (most times very juicy and moist, but I have had several times where it was dry) and a small sirloin (well seasoned, but I tend to ask for smaller steaks cooked a level less than what I would usually ask for- i.e. medium-rare as opposed to medium).  The sides are good. The baked potato soup is really tasty.  Mashed potatoes are good.  The salads a good and generous (tip: the standard salad with a meal comes with egg on it - make sure to ask for them to omit the egg if that's not your thing).  Husband leans towards the pulled pork, as he is obsessed with it.  The kids like the chicken fingers. One area of complaint- the kids' mini hamburgers were the tiniest piece of meat I have ever seen on a bun.    Service is generally anywhere between competent to good.  On occasions where we have had a problem, management has always been quick to resolve it.  On certain occasions they will bring out plastic cowboy hats for the kids, which are a huge hit.  Warning to those of you with birthdays- if you tell them it is your birthday, they will bring out a saddle for you to sit on while they sing their happy birthday song to you!"}
{"text":"Sirloin was great.  Baked potato was good.  Beer was really cold but too forever to get.  Do not order the pulled pork sandwich it was horrible.  The waiter was a moron and was difficult to understand, not because he wasn't American but because he was an idiot."}
{"text":"Horrible food, service and not worth the trip. Shrimp is chewy, meat is tough. We will not be back!"}
{"text":"This is a family event.  Loud music, free peanuts and lots of excitement.    We really love the ribs and only come for those.  They are the best however from time to time they get really charred.  This time was one of those times.....but still fall off the bone.  Potato skins appetizer was pretty overcooked and some pieces were inedible.  Everything but the rubs were mediocre, have the ribs!  Note:  only one men's stall and it was taken for more than 20 minutes - had to take the young man into the ladies.  Oh and be careful, I watched a number of people slip on the food and peanut shells on the floor."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon at 1pm, we arrive with our party of 11 amd were told another party of 11 had called in and would be seated ahead of us at the only large table resulting in an hour and fifteen minute wait. Hmmm...well the birthday boy really wanted to go here and they have the barrel of peanuts to keep them occupied, so we decided to tough it out.  The hostess came and asked if we wanted to split up and we did not, then later returned to ask if we wanted to be in booths back to back and we did not. Finally on the third try, we were told we would be seated in booths across from each other. But when we were escorted to our tables we were indeed back to back. Had it been me alone, I would have politely asked to be seated as we had requested...but alas other family members were running the show, so we sat where delivered.  I love the yeasty rolls and cinnamon butter, so I was happy to munch away on those while our orders were taken. I had the chicken critters, steak fries and salad with honey mustard and it was okay, nothing super special but I didnt really expect it to be. Our waitress was helpful and our glasses were only empty a couple of times, but the pitcher was nearby, so we just did our own.  We had a variety of dishes from burgers, steak, chicken salad and my chicken fingers at our table and all were approved and enjoyed. No dessert for us, but a rousing yee haw birthday song for my father in law was, ummm interesting.  It is a chain and decent food, but you probably will not write home about your meal here."}
{"text":"Most of the time Texas Roadhouse is a dependable restaurant with gods quality food and service. Last night my son and I ate here with some friends. We waited about 10 minutes at our table before we were even offered any drinks. The service was extremely slow for a Texas Roadhouse, there were large gaps of time between our appetizers, salads and entrees. My son got the ribs and after one bite only ate his fries. My steak was just okay not the quality that I was expecting and my baked potato a little on the not done side.  When my son complained our server only said sorry and then offered him a box to take his food home. When the bill came we were charged for both entrees and no adjustments were made. Not the experience that I have had in other Texas Roadhouses."}
{"text":"I love coming here. The bread, the steak, the service has always been spot on, and I get to watch the games all under the same roof. Not much to complain about. No complaints, only compliments. We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This time we had Regal as our server and I have never had a more friendly and accommodating server! I mean, I am a server and I have experience with large crowds during busy seasons and let me tell you--it is not easy! However, our drinks were never empty and we were never faced with anything less than a huge smile! He even shook our hands after the meal! I wish he would serve use every time.  Service is great and the food is always good. My family comes here in large numbers so I get that we are a bit hard to take care of, but they always do a magnificent job!   Give this guy a raise!"}
{"text":"The main manager & his 4'2\" assistant treat the waiters & waitresses, so horrible, that the door is constantly revolving with new staff.  They both have chosen their favorites & are abusive to everyone else.  I got fired over a $3.00 discrepancy & I had been here almost a year with no other issues.  My friend was fired for eating a french fry.  Many of the decent waitresses are jumping ship & running to other locations.  If you chooses to eat here, please make sure your meal & experience is a 5 star.  So ask to speak to the abusive \"Gordon Ramsey\" wannabe if you dont get treated like royalty, or your food isn't on point!  He really is the worst boss Ive ever worked for."}
{"text":"I love this texas road house because the food and service is amazing every time i am there"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before stopping along the way on a random road trip. The food was AMAZING. I ended up taking half mine home cause it was so filling. The bread they serve at the beginning is hands down some of the best I have ever had. And how can you go wrong with fried pickles??"}
{"text":"I think that the biggest draw to Texas Roadhouse has to be the fresh, hot rolls that the host brings to your table as you are seated. I think that's why people keep coming back. It can't be for the blaring music that is just so annoying. The service is consistently excellent. The salad is always brought to the table within minutes of ordering, too. My wife just gets the loaded sweet potato and I usually get a steak, potato and salad. One criticism is that they will not seat your party until everyone is there. We had to walk out one time because our son had to work late so they would not seat the rest of us."}
{"text":"Every Texas Roadhouse is about the same everywhere.  I came here for lunch with my brother and mother. My mom ordered the mushroom chicken and it was pretty salty and her frys were kinda burnt. My brother had the roadkill and he said it was pretty good as always. I had the chicken critters which were also very good and mashed potatoes. Overall it was a great lunch except for my mother's dish. Great atmosphere, great service."}
{"text":"So I was on a date with my husband and the service good. We left a great tip for our waiter. As we were leaving I needed to use the restroom. as im using the restroom one of the workers com in to clean.  Than another worker comes in and they began to talk about another worker that just got hired and why the manager is thinking about promoting her and she just start working there. That's not that worst part. One of the workers leave out and and one stays in. The one that stays in is sweeping the floor. While I'm in the middle stall she sweeps my jeans and immediately apologize. IM PISSED!!!!! My question is why are you sweeping in stall #2 when you are in stall #1. That tells me you are not paying attention to what you are doing.  So I come out to was my hands and notice that my pants were wet. I also notice that floor was really and there was no wet floor sign. The young lady was in the 3rd stall sweeping so while washing my hands I said to her \"dis you just sweep my jeans with that dirty ass broom\" she says I said I'm sorry I say what is your name she says I said I was sorry I say I didn't ask for an apology I asked for you name. She doesn't say anything so I walk into the stalk that she is sweeping in and ask for her name again and she REPEATS herself and says I'm sorry.  Now I'm irritated and ask why she won't give me her name she meekly says ALYSSA. I walk away and go to the host and ask for a manager.   IT GETS WORST......  I asked for a manager and I got a manager I don't believe she gave me her name neither do I remember asking.  However I do remember that as she walked up  with ALYSSA telling \"her side of the story\" the manger was very defensive when I told her what happened in the restroom.  The manager wanted to know WHY was the employees name so important to me and if she was wearing a name tag why did I need the employee to tell me. I explained that ALYSSA was inside of a restroom stall and I could not see her until I walked into the stall. The manger than told me that ALYSSA was intimidated my me and she was on the verge of crying. I said well I'm sorry this is her job she works around PEOPLE everyday I don't care about her crying she swept my jeans with a dirty ass broom. The manager said well I talk to her. I looked at her dead in her eyes and said I JUST SPENT OVER $100 IN THIS PLACE TO BE TREATED THIS WAY. I WILL NEVER BE BACK HERE AGAIN!   THE SERVICE WAS GOOD BUT THE MANAGER WHO WAS THERE ON OCTOBER 17, 2014 ABOUT 10 PM YOU SHOULD TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS WAY BETTER."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. Molly is awesome. Very service forward.  Food was very good Prime Rib mashed potatoes and a salad.   Place is packed.   Will be back."}
{"text":"I am always happy to go eat here!  Food is yummy and I feel like a complete slob when I come out of there.    Had one HUGE issue tonight. The hubby is on crutches and on the way out one of his crutches slid a good foot and a half on the greasy floor.  Just an FYI....that could have been a EXTREMLY large lawsuit had he hurt his fresh out of surgery ankle because of a greasy floor.  Otherwise very please with the food ad service."}
{"text":"My husband loves the prime rib and other steaks, so we return time and again.   Unfortunately, I like to try other dishes like chicken or salad.  I have ordered the prime rib too.  It's perfectly cooked every time.   Today, I thought I'd try the salmon salad minus croutons.   The free house salad my husband got with his prime rib looked better than my salad! It had tomato, cheese, egg.... The salmon was overcooked and dry.   If you want a prime rib, this is your place!  If you want chicken or salmon, it will be very dry and barely edible.  Bread is great, though!"}
{"text":"Our waitress Glenda did a wonderful job... took very good care of us!! The girls at the front were horrible! When is it appropriate to be grabbing each others butts and crotch while at work?? Completely inappropriate!! The manager was standing there during this ridiculously   embarrassing behavior!"}
{"text":"We lucked out and got a seat at the bar.  Drinks were fantastic.  Service was great.  And the food!!!  My husband loved his steak.  This place is great and will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Food is fairly good.Generally my boyfriend and I go about once or twice a month. Sometimes the steak is perfect and others not quite. However the rolls are awesome and food is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Love the food here.  I try something different each time and have not been disappointed yet.  Today was the steak medallions, and they were excellent.  Also got the New Kenny Cooler and it was delicious.  The atmosphere is always fun, and sometimes includes line dancing servers.  The service has always been good.  I don't get to go to Texas Roadhouse often, but when I do, it is always an absolute treat!"}
{"text":"I took my lovely niece to eat at Texas Roadhouse for late night dinner because she's never been. While eating we heard yelling and screaming in the back.  I assume it was an irate customers.  It turned out to be 2 employees arguing and using profanity in the back.  When I say arguing, I mean yelling to the point where it sounded like a fight was about to happen.  It slightly frightened my niece.  She was concerned and so was I.  My niece got out of her seat and sat beside me and said \"I'm ready to go!\"  This really saddens me that my niece had to experience this on her first trip to TX Roadhouse.  I didn't pay for her to come hear employees argue.  I would expect behavior like this from customers because the population of people change from day-to-day... BUT EMPLOYEES!  Why ruin your reputation like that... was it worth it?  Besides that altercation, my waiter was very pleasant and checked on us frequently.  My food came out warm... i prefer piping hot so i know it's cooked fresh but i was so tired I didn't feel like asking them to heat it up.  Despite that, the meat was very moist and tasty and the green beans and mash were good!  They lose a star due to lack of professionalism and warm food.  I'm sure my experience will be better next time!!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed ..my son wanted to take the family out to dinner and I suggested Texas Roadhouse the last time I ate there the ribs were to die for, not this time. I ordered the half rack of ribs & steak the steak was raw and had so much gristle I could hardly cut the ribs were burnt had every little meat and was covered in BBQ my son's was the same.  Not like I remember. I was glad I ordered the baked potato because the potato and bread was all I ate could not believe the ribs nothing on the bone the last time I was there the meat fell off the bone not this time you couldn't find the meat and what was there was burnt they were cut up not all together like I remember. BTW I ordered my steak medium well and everyone at the table laughed and told me to kill it ..it was still moving."}
{"text":"Jessica our waitress was SOO NICE! She made our dining experience great! We waited about 20 minutes to be be seated for a party of two, but hey, it's Texas Roadhouse, I could've waited another 20 minutes!   The food was great as it always is! The steaks are flavorful, the sides are delicious, and the atmosphere is that of being in a country type of club. (It can be pretty loud in hurr) The music of course is country and they play all the new hits! Oh yes!   The rolls here are to die for! They are warm, toasty, and the cinnamon spread you get with them make it 263783x better! You get rolls as soon as your seated and of course don't be shy, you can ask for more if you'd like!   I love Texas Roadhouse!!  *During the week anytime before 6pm they have great offers and deals that go on!   *Sign up to their vip list to get a free appetizer!  *There are peanuts for DAYSSS here!"}
{"text":"Man I have been to a lot of Texas Roadhouses but the quality of service here is a level above. Excellent staff friendly and prompt. Brought in six young boys for a birthday party and they were treated like kings. Great job!!!"}
{"text":"Honesty was pretty disappointed. I really wanted mac n cheese for one of my sides but didn't see it on the menu,  decided I would ask just in case and I was excited to know they actually did have Mac n cheese, it just wasn't in the menu. I ordered the New York steak with mashed potatoes and corn also. Everything was great until I got my mac n cheese only to realize it was just kraft mac n cheese. I wish they would have told me that before I was told I had to pay and additional   2+$ when I could have gotten my own box for .99! Not cool Texas road house.. not cool.."}
{"text":"Best steak ever (ribeye) with the combination of Cesar salad/steak fries ...good environment also and good to celebrate Bdays \"waiting list\" move real fast so definitely we will come back!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend calling ahead to get on the waitlist. Even if you have to wait, it's so worth it! Everyone was so friendly -the hostesses, servers, bus boys; the manager even came by to see that everything was okay. My husband had the catfish, I had the bone-in ribeye. Everything was cooked to perfection! Thank you for a wonderful dining experience, I'm so full but can't wait til our next visit! A great big thanks to Joe, our server, he was so much fun -thanks for suggesting the sangria margarita (delish)."}
{"text":"Received a gift card for this restaurant. Really do not understand the attraction. So many people waiting inside, I wondered if a fire code was violated =) Was able to get on the wait list through Yelp \0/  Waitress lost our order, but she was in the midst of finals week. (I have a college student). Even so, the food was good, but nothing special.  The sangria margarita my college student got was tasty.  Very loud. We do not like tv's in the restaurant. Once the gc is spent, I probably won't return."}
{"text":"We always come here for the bread baskets and cinnamon butter. Salads are good, steaks sometimes get overcooked. The potato skin appetizers are awesome! Ribs are either hit or miss. I usually come here every once in awhile."}
{"text":"Nice addition on North side. Their steaks are Juicy and made fresh . The cut fries are crispy . Chilli is awesome . The strip steak was out of world. One of our favorite Restaurant now in North Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"best steak salad, best steaks, best pork chops and price is very reasonable and the rolls are to die for, staff always friendly. love the peanuts."}
{"text":"The portions are absolutely gi-normous.  The servers are very thorough and gave me a sample platter of their sides to help me decide what sides I wanted with my entree.  I think the samples made me stuffed on their own.  The quality of food is just average, though."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Food was absolutely hot and fresh. I sat at the bar and Sarah was amazing! I definitely recommend this location, and sit at the bar and let Sarah take care of you!"}
{"text":"You can never have a bad night at Texas Roadhouse.....country music, fried food, good drinks. A little chilly in here tonight, but I'll get over it.   Waiter is doing an outstanding job and the food so far has been spectacular.  I've miss that apple butter. Just got pace myself with fried foods and I'll be good."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better places to eat in this small town. I got the bbq ribs but my friends steak was a lot tastier. The rolls with the honey butter was good. The servers do a line dancing routine every hour so that was interesting, they also do for your birthday. Its like a hyped up Black Angus. But I guess thats what I get for going to a \"Texas\" roadhouse in North Carolina."}
{"text":"If I can give this place a 0 star I would. I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD TO EXPLAIN TO A MANAGER about how much I ate and how much I drank in order for her to decide if I  can order another drink. She also approached the table with major attitude before we even spoke. Such a terrible experience!"}
{"text":"First time here at early dinner. They just opened for business recently so appeared to be overstaffed a bit. Seated right away with freshly cooked yeast rolls with whipped cinnamon butter. Very very good. Our Server was Christina. Very pleasant and attentive. I hope she makes the cut. We would come back for her alone.   Ordered the Cactus Blossom appetizer, prime rib and Ft Worth Rib Eye with a salad and baked potato. Food was very good - a bit over seasoned for my taste but that can be remedied next time. Drinks, appetizer and salads were served way to fast and main course came while we were still working on the salads and appetizer.  Beef was cooked to order and really, really good - the best my wife remembers having.   The music when we first came in was crazy loud. I measured it at 83 db (yes there is a app for that). I mentioned it to our server and she spoke to the owner/manager. It was turned down to 77 db. Any sustained sound at and above 75 db can cause long term hearing loss in both youth and adults. Anything above 70 db can permanently harm a baby and would be an OSHA concern for employees. I mentioned it our server again and she once again explained to mgmt my concerns and it was turned down to 67 db. I appreciate their listening to me and their consideration.  To review: Great service. Thank you Christina! = 5 stars Great food overall = 4 stars Ambiance -3 stars for volume + 1 for listening = 4 stars  Over all = 4.25 stars.  I recommend them. Just consider the seasoning if you need to watch your salt intake and slow the service down if you want to catch your breath between courses. The other Roadhouse across the street is in really big trouble now.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"By far the BEST steak around. I've eaten here many times and have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Back for another visit to the Roadhouse and this time it was Xmas eve. They had limited hours, but still good service. I ordered the burger and although it was average, it will not be ordered again. It was a thin patty and had no real memorable qualities. Another steak had to be returned due to being undercooked, but I think the rest of the table enjoyed the usual boring rotation of either ribs, chicken critters or chili. Of course, the bread and peanuts are better than the food, so just go to the bar and buy a drink and eat those items for free."}
{"text":"Steak was great, ribs were very tasty; crispy on the outside with meat falling off the bones. I really liked their sweet baked potato too. Get there early if you can...I also really like eating peanuts while I wait for food."}
{"text":"This location is my favorite. The food was good. Our server was good as well. I wish she had checked back a little bit more and didn't seem so rushed when she did. I do understand it was busy.  Other than that, this is visit was a great one. Our steaks were cooked to perfection and the bread was delicious! The wait time wasn't bad either considering the amount of people that were there."}
{"text":"Great steak, ribs, great sides, great rolls , peanuts, all at a very reasonable price-what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"Call ahead. Eat lots of rolls. Get the double pork chop, and you will be in heaven.   Key is to call ahead.  Ive never had a problem here and always loved my food."}
{"text":"Went about a month ago. Had the prime rib.  Loved it. 7 of us went we all had a good meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had Traveled from Southern California, last minute , unfortunate and exhausting day in Glendale, AZ we were absolutely starving and looking for a good dinner and a cocktail. Texas Roadhouse not only had the best steak 's they had an amazing service staff as well. Our server Jonathan, a.k.a J.B. Recommended a beer called \"The Kilt-Lifter\" from a local brewery and I had a peach tea vodka drink. Both hit-the-spot. The steaks were great especially the Bone-in Ribeye. Food was fantastic and the service was friendly and worth mention to the manager."}
{"text":"Due to the horrible service from the \"Service Manager\" Meghan, I will never return to this location. My family and I have many great experience at this location including friendly service and great food. This time the food was not too great. My mom and dad ordered ribs that came out burnt and very dry. Of course they ate a couple ribs before making a complaint, which we hardly ever do. After I kindly asked the server to bring over her manager so we can address the issue to her, the service manager meghan came and agreed that the ribs were burnt and should have never made it out of the kitchen. She did not offer a replacement meal, instead took the meal and said she will take care of it. When we received our check, I noticed that a partial discount of $6.00 was taken off of the bill. I kindly requested the server to bring her manager back so we can address this problem again. Meghan comes back with an attitude and decided to argue with me about the food. She insisted that there was only a partial discount because my mom and dad ate a couple of ribs. I tell her that sure some of the food had been consumed but over half had to be thrown out and the total inconvenience should have been enough to take that meal off the tab. She decided to interrupt and give me a lecture on how the food should have not been consumed? I told her I don't have a problem with the $6 discount so long as she would have offered a replacement meal! She was very unprofessional, very rude, with a nasty attitude. She failed her job as a \"service manager\" and ultimately made matters worse. Her horrible \"guest service\" was an experience that I never had before, and because of this I will refrain from coming to this location. I'm disappointed it had to come down to this because usually the service and food is great.  Thanks a lot Meghan.   Sincerely a family who was looking for a nice meal to eat."}
{"text":"When we entered The Texas Road House we were greeted with a warm welcoming greeting  and seated quickly. It all went down hill from there.  We waited for 15 minutes before we had to get up and order our drinks from the bar. The waitress then came to the table and ask what we wanted but saw that we had drinks so left. She was friendly but seemed overwhelmed and left for another 10 minutes before finally taking our order. My wife ordered the chicken fried chicken and I ordered the filet medium rear. My steak came out well done and then took 25 more minutes to fix it (it's medium rear). At that point I said I don't want it because I'm ready to go so the manager offered to take 50% off my steak which I didn't eat????? I told the waitress that I'm not paying for a steak I didn't eat. She said she would take care of it and did but the manager didn't follow up with us. No response or stop by to say sorry???"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with my new boyfriend.... First time for me... We were both treated very cordially, & had our food served just right. .. Service was on time,& food was excellent! .. We both ordered stakes, one rare, the other medium... They were cooked to perfection, & the bread, special  cinnamon butter, was a special treat!... Good family atmosphere,  & friendly servers... The drinks, ( we both had iced teas,) were very good...      We will certainly be going there soon ...As we both enjoyed our food & experience there! ...Highly recommend that anyone looking for a great a great dining experience,  give this place a try!... You won't be sorry... Thanks Texas Roadhouse,  for a memorable enjoyable evening...Two thumbs up from us!..."}
{"text":"This place has been knocking it out of the park for years. Little baby Jesus himself comes to the Mesa location, just for the Cactus Blossom.  I can't find a better non-franchise BBQ joint that can give you better full-rack. Donald Trump himself admitted that he came up with \"ITS GOING TO BE HUGE\" after being served a full rack at TR-House (true story). That's right...WINNING!........God bless you, Texas Roadhouse of Mesa."}
{"text":"Texas Road House has some of the best ribs I have ever eaten! Their steaks are marginal but the ribs and pulled pork are to die for. The portions are very generous and I really like the bucket of peanuts on the table; Oh I forgot to mention the hot rolls melt in your mouth and the chili is the absolute best in the world. You can go and eat a bowl of chili and rolls and make it a meal!"}
{"text":"We decided to have supper here last night and we were not disappointed.  The restaurant was full and the staff was very attentive.  Candy was our server and she was great. The hot food items were hot and the cold food items were cold,  everything was  cooked to our requests and delivered in a timely fashion. We would stop here again."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times.  On this last time, the waitress asked to see our ID's before serving us alcohol.  I'm 43.  My wife is 41.  She refused to serve my wife because my wife didn't have her license.  WTF.  On the previous 3 visits, no ID was required.  I asked to speak to the manager.  He came over and reiterated that they would not serve my wife alcohol.  I raised hell (sort of).  I asked him to use some common sense and look at my beautiful wife (hoping that comment pays off tonight) and see that she is older than 21.  No go.  WTF.  I left him a strongly worded note on my receipt.  He actually said my wife was breaking the law by not having her ID on her at all times.  Dumbass.  Food was not good this time mostly because I was pissed at this manager."}
{"text":"Our waitress was exceptional, but the food was nauseating. Literally. My date and I just went to our respective restrooms to throw up. They took some off of our bill, because we barely ate anything and we looked super sick, but I wish we'd just never gone inside. As we were waiting for our table in front of the restaurant, an old man with a walker whom had just come out of the restaurant started urinating immediately in front of the Texas Roadhouse. That should have been a sign. Would have preferred to eat gas station hotdogs."}
{"text":"Tonight our server Victoria was awesome!  My dinner (out of 6) simply wasn't placed. She explained and didn't throw the kitchen staff or anyone else under the bus. Her honesty & integrity was refreshing. Her attitude was amazing and very funny. Vanessa (manager) was also fantastic. All in all a great night. Thank you."}
{"text":"I was there with a group of six.  We all ordered different items and all felt the food was mediocre except for one member of our party that ordered a hamburger.  He commented that the burger tasted funny and left most of it uneaten.  He decided later to try another bite and found a piece of plastic in the burger.  Who knows what else was in it. The rolls were good.  The sides were decent.  The beer was cold.  That is the best I can say about  the experience."}
{"text":"I'm glad that someone commented previously about Ben B. the waiter at Logan's in Mesa.  He is superb and better than any waitstaff we have ever had there.  He knows everything about the menu and suggests variations including items not on the printed menu.  He couldn't do enough for us and we will always ask for him when we return--even if we have to wait.  Richard McTevia"}
{"text":"Love their rolls, haven't had a bad experience with any of the waiters/waitresses yet. Although we did get one who just seemed to always forget about us, but we haven't seen him since that night so that's good. Their steaks are never any good, always either over cooked for what you asked, dry, no taste at all so you have to use steak sauce to get any flavor whatsoever and very, very, very chewy. We love coming here and just don't order the steak, everything else is good and tasty though."}
{"text":"Service was not very good today eat here many times and service is usually pretty good but not today food was good but service thumbs down."}
{"text":"so sad , been eating  at Texas road houses for years, they have been consistently good. At least as far as the steaks are concerned. This trip was awful, no prime rib left , it was only 8 o'clock, so I ordered a bone in rib eye , unbelievably tuff, had a hard time eating it. Would have complained but I was in a hurry to get somewhere else ."}
{"text":"Well the service was very good both times. Attentive ,no mistakes. The Porterhouse steaks and prime rib were very good ,  but the ribs were dry and not very tasty this time. In the past they had been very good, but for now I will skip them . But for a chain it's not bad, an affordable steak house in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several texas road houses across the country, and this by far has been the worst one I have tried. They run out of prime rib, Bad service, no apologies from manager, one time we wee overcharged for the number of  drinks we ordered. Thank god it didn't turn into a nightmare to get that off our bill."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday. We were sat right away by a pleasant hostess. Our waitress came by promptly, and our drinks were ordered. The food came out at the right time. Not too long or too short. I like to compare places based on their filet mignon. This one I ordered medium well. I allowed them to fan it out so it would be cooked properly. They cooked it perfectly and it was great. Fries tasted good as well. Corn was ok. Other person liked their shrimp and no complaints about the food. We all actually loved our food!  The bread rolls were great as usual. As for the margarita at our table, person stated it was the best one in a long time. Overall, we had no complaints & had an excellent time. The one issue if I had to pick one out was that there are no paper towels in the bathroom, only blow dryers."}
{"text":"I. Am. Livid.   My drink order was wrong. My food order was wrong. My supposed med rare 10 oz ribeye was literally 6 oz of cold l, blue-rare FAT, like it was this thin, mushy, jagged flap of meat on my plate, and the grilled shrimp I ordered was mia. At this point I give up, take the last of my \"steak\" and my untouched loaded mashed potatoes to go with the intent to finish at home. I do so, and I ALMOST VOMITED. I NEVER spit food out, but something in my potatoes tasted like a combination of rancid cheese and sour spoiled milk, idk about what you'd do, but I'm not going to taste test the cheese and sour cream to pinpoint he culprit. I sat there gagging because I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth. This was within 15 minutes of getting home, and I live 5 miles away! I am just utterly disgusted and furious with the GARBAGE I was served. That was not worth what I, my fiance, and my friends spent. I will NOT be returning and will be contacting corporate."}
{"text":"Great service and fun atmosphere!!  Love the bread and peanuts. All of the sides are good. Pretty good sized portions."}
{"text":"Some chain restaurants get a bad rap, but having gone to Texas Roadhouse at least 30 times in the last 3-4 years, I can honestly say I am almost always very satisfied.  This place stays BUSY! Expect to wait for a table. When you are seated, the greeter brings fresh (and I mean FRESH!!) baked bread with her. The butter is a soft whipped butter with cinnamon and let's just say I could eat the bread and butter alone all day, every day... Super good!  The servers usually approach the table within a minute or two to start you off with a drink or appetizer. In most cases, they follow up at appropriate times to take your order, explain the menu, and answer questions.  I have never once had to wait long for my salad (very basic iceberg lettuce with cheese, croutons, tomato, etc) and I have mine with their delicious honey mustard dressing. I also have never had to wait for my entree. In fact, it's not uncommon to receive it while working on the end of my salad.   I usually have the filet mignon and only once out of all the times I've had it has it not been cooked properly. It is almost always seasoned perfectly and is tender and juicy. They simply do steaks well in my opinion. Even if they aren't using the highest cuts, their steaks are still tasty and very reasonably priced. Having said that, I honestly don't know what level of cuts of meat they serve. The service is almost always excellent. I don't think the servers get more than 4 tables at a time, which allows them to give each table all of the attention they deserve.   I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Texas Roadhouse to anyone. Oh, I almost forgot. I don't care at all for any kind of shellfish but the last time I was there on a date, she had a shrimp dish. The shrimp were on a skewer and I tried one. Holy moly it was delicious! I did have their ribs once which I did not care much for. I think I'll stick with Lucille's at Tempe Market Place for ribs but have otherwise always been happy at this restaurant."}
{"text":"LOVE Texas Road House, great food and atmospere! The pricing is really great, especially for a steak house. The have a cactus bloom that is better then outbacks blooming onion....but outbacks dipping sauce is much better. That is literally the only downside to any of the food I have had at Texas Road House."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. However, I was quite surprised that people were throwing peanut shells all over the floors. I understand that this is acceptable and ok, but I found this action to be quite barbaric and disgusting. Won't be returning to a place where people willingly are capable of acting in this manner."}
{"text":"Wow new management.  Change for worst. 3 50 Miller and Coors are gone.  Miller lite on tap is  gone.  Now plenty of space at the bar and shorter lines outside . Servers are not happy.  It used to be a fun place offering good value on a beer and an appetizer.   Guess they have gone uptown.  Looking for a new place .  Old review below. Great Food Fun and People - Always a great value.  It can get a little crowded but it is worth the wait.  Call ahead seating is a great help."}
{"text":"Try the portobello mushroom chicken.  Best I ever had!  And YES this place is loud.  My ears are still ringing the day after.  A terrific fun place and the prices are good."}
{"text":"I went out last night in search of a restaurant with good soup, but instead decided to try Texas Roadhouse. As soon as you walk in, you feel welcomed and right at home. The staff are all smiling and welcoming you, and just the atmosphere of the place was great! Roasted peanuts await you at your table, along with some delicious bread! I had a bacon cheese burger, which I could only finish half, while my husband had a steak that he actually enjoyed! Our waitress kept up with the drinks and checked up on us enough, but not to much to where she was bothering. All in all the service and food was great! I will definitely recommend it to others, and be back myself!"}
{"text":"Food good for a chain. I gave it 4 stars for the above and beyond service fromJohn our waiter . And when you want to sit and visit with friends they don't try to push you out."}
{"text":"Went there for first time Friday very busy even though we arrived before five.  Plenty of parking, no problem.  Seated immediately and got free unlimited rolls delivered without even asking.  Some of the best ever.  She ordered a house margarita, excellent.  Also the ribs were excellent, falling off the bone.  I had country fried steak, not bad but the mashed potatoes were home made and excellent.  Had the best service ever in Surprise from Stephanie, what a pleasant person."}
{"text":"For only being open for a few days, with only dinner hours, this location is doing FANTASTIC.  They are super-crushed busy during open hours, and they are handling it impressively. While we were here, we ordered drinks, appetizers, and meals. All were out in respectable time!  The service was impeccable!  If they continue this effort, they will do great here!  Very impressed!"}
{"text":"High energy, excellent food, excellent service, excellent management team.  You could even say it's legendary!!  Love the new building too!"}
{"text":"Every thing is excellent from my Margareta to my food, great service , friendly clean, luv it.."}
{"text":"Good food they know how to make steak Cute waitress's  Food time is what it is  if it's busy expect a little wait.  But it does come hot to your table  just like it should !  Salads are real fresh a little expensive but good!"}
{"text":"This is One of our favorite sit down restaurants. The service was outstanding we had a very attentive waitress who checked in with us often to make sure everything was ok. The food was great and very reasonably priced. We come to this location a few times a month so we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"have to say the food was a huge disappointment... fried chicken was greasy,  and flattened boneless..  vodka tonic flat..."}
{"text":"This place has wonderful food and friendly service. The food is consistently good too. Be sure to call ahead during busy times and they'll hold a table for you. The only downfall at this place is that they play the music very loudly so it's sometimes difficult to hold a decent conversation."}
{"text":"For ambience this place is good.   For food quality it gets only 3 stars.    I had the small filet and if there was any seasoning on it I could not detect any.  Good steaks can be found at The Keg or Firebirds.  My mate had a chicken salad which was decent.  However, one expects a place with \"Texas\" in the name to have outstanding steaks.  Warning: If you have any peanut allergies stay far away.  There are buckets of peanuts on every table.   Fortunately, there is a small notice posted at the door about this.  By the way, we called for reservations and the hostess said that they do not take any.  She said that we can call to see how long the wait time is."}
{"text":"We had dinner tonight at the Goodyear Texas Roadhouse and it was awesome  our server Stephany was right on, she was smiling and made us feel at home right away, she checked on us often always smiling. Food was great. Hubby had the ribs and I had the end cut of the prime rib, best ever, but our server was GREAT. Will go again soon.  All the server we smiling and happy"}
{"text":"I have always  loved this place. The hot rolls are so good I could eat just those and still  be satisfied.  I'm a steak girl I must admit yummo."}
{"text":"Lemme tell you... I've never ever ever had a chicken tender I never liked.  Till now. I'm not sure what was wrong with it, but it just tasted disgusting. I only ate 1. The girl came & asked if I wanted a box, of course I said.. No. She was like \"are you sure??? It's so good??\" Didn't have the heart to tell her it's disgusting. The chicken inside of the breading was like mush. Didn't look like chicken. & its was maybe room temp.   It got 3 stars because... The rolls were delicious! Fresh baked and yummy. We were seated quickly but it took over 30 min to get our food. That is ridiculous. My boyfriend liked his ribs, he had no complains. But if it were just me, I'd give 1 star... I wasted my money on the chicken. :("}
{"text":"I'll start by saying this is not the type of place that I'd normally go to, I was invited.  The music was very loud outside, but blissfully lower when we entered, which was a plus. All of the staff were very polite and moderately fast with the service. I ordered the grilled chicken with corn and vegetables. It was okay but not enough to bring me back. Corn was drowned in pepper water, steamed broccoli was dripping with butter sauce, and the chicken was coated in plain bbq sauce....  To sum it up: Great staff. Bleh food."}
{"text":"We had a party of 24 and they were able to accommodate us with very little wait on a Sunday lunch when we used the call ahead option.  Our wait staff was great, had a few hiccups but what can you expect with that many people.  They were all friendly, attentive, and timely.  Celebrated my daughters baptism and they made sure she felt special and even brought out the saddle and ice cream for her and did the big yee-haw.  She was the one who chose the restaurant, so she was excited they did that for her.  Way to go guys, thank you."}
{"text":"Meh. Typical chain steak place but with an odd, chaotic layout and unhappy staff. My steak and shrimp combo did not have much flavor(nor did the potato and veggie sides) and the steak was fatty and overlooked. Had to ask numerous times for drink refills, extra napkins and our check. Hubby thought his Ny strip was decent, but not as good as at The Keg or even Logan's. The buns were not nearly as tasty and sweet as Logan's either. We will not be back with so many options nearby."}
{"text":"Just left this restaurant an hour ago. Asked to not be sat by young kids as we had a group of adults looking to have a conversation without screaming children. The hostess tried to sit us down at the ONLY table in the place that had 3 little kids at the table across from the table she wanted to sit us at. She had also asked them to move their diaper bag that was on the seat of the table she wanted to sit us at......at that point you think something would of registered in her head from the conversation with us moments ago.....what part of not by kids did she not understand? When we confronted her about this, she laughed and put the menus on the table anyways. We asked for manager,  and when he came out to talk with us he only said \"well it's a family resturant\"! Really,  out of all the seats in the whole place you want to sit us at the only table that had babies next to the table! The manager just smerked and didn't care. Oh well it's Texas Roudhouses loss, as we did go there a couple times a week. Me nor anyone else in my party will ever come back, I will tell everyone I know about this experience as well.  Corporate Call me....."}
{"text":"My favorite spot! Great friendly workers always happy and loud! Love the atmosphere! Best place to take a group or just one on one. No reasons to give this place lower then a 5 star! Very we'll managed!"}
{"text":"We were greeted. The hosts were nice. The wait was only fifteen minutes in a Thursday night on December 2nd, 2015. So far so good.  The server came up and greeted us but didn't seem excited to be there. He took a while to take care of me and my family. Our beverages took a while to arrive. The refill of bread took a while. Our actual meals took about forty minutes to arrive and it wasn't even up to par. My mothers veggies were cold, french fries stale, and steak was dry and flavorless. My steak was cooked fine but it did lack a little bit of seasoning. Our server barely checked on us and he even forgot about us for a while. At least he said sorry.  Our server was Tyler- blue (or green eyes) and a hat. About early twenties. Maybe he was just tired or is stressed. Whatever the case may be, I hope everything is okay in his life and that he gets it worked out so that it doesn't conflict with his serving again.  Texas Roadhouse usually doesn't disappoint but sadly this time it did."}
{"text":"3 stars because of how much I loved them in the past. 2 starts because of last night. My last  2 visits, service has been poor. Last night was a disappointment. Service was slow and neglectful. Hard to get refills, or napkins when a spill occurred. A salad ordered without croutons came with them on. Salmon ordered with the butter sauce on the side came like that but also still cooked and drenched in butter. We finally got a hold of a manger who remade the salmon and came back with salmon that was not cooked thoroughly, did not ask for a 3 try. Also, I ordered the steak fries, there is no mention that they come with seasoning. I told the manager that I could not eat them (due to allergies) when she removed the salmon. She never offered to replace them with another side. The salmon came back alone. And yes, we were charged in full."}
{"text":"Had lunch on Saturday and had a terrible experience. My mother and I came in and sat in the bar area. When my mom sat down she had soda on her arm and on her legs. I guess the waitress doesn't like cleaning up her section because we found used plates under the bench pushed to the corner. I'm also guessing someone spilled their soda because our table was soaked in soda. We decided to move to another table because of how messy our table was and due to the fact that our waitress never came to greet us. Had a good experience with our new waitress until our food arrived. The women who brought our food literally said \" I would of been your server if you didn't move\" with a very bad attitude. I was beside myself. What makes her think that she can talk to her customers like that. Maybe if she cleaned up her section I would of stayed. Never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Today I wanted steak from Texas Roadhouse.  I ordered a ribeye with steak fries fully loaded and a salad.  I asked for a well done steak.  When I got the meal the steak fries looked like they were under the warmer for a very long time. Very dry.  And the steak was not well done.  I asked for it to be more done.  The watress was awesome to make sure I got fresh fries. The manager came with my steak to make sure it was well done and then ran off.  It was so unedible  I told the watress and the manager just took off $10.  Thanks for a discount on a steak I can't eat.  The watress could see I was not happy.  Clearly if they can't cook a well done steak with making it taste like rubber, maybe you shouldn't offer it on the menu.  Maybe the Texas Roadhouse on Power Rd can cook a good steak."}
{"text":"I'll admit - the food isn't the healthiest or the best tasting chicken or steak that I've ever had.. but for the price for 2 people (I got roasted chicken, mashed potatoes with brown gravy, steamed veggies & he got smothered chicken, and the same sides as me, the total for $21.90 ain't so bad.  This was our second visit for pickup and it really is hard to disappoint especially when we are too lazy to cook most of the time, and want something cooked fast and has a sense of comfort food/bbq embodied in the menu. I'm not complaining since I would take this over over Chili's any day."}
{"text":"I.  Love.  The.  Food.  Out.  Here.  And.  The.  Cheesecake.  Was.  Awesome.  Im.  Here.  For.  Mother's. Day.  Dinner.  I.  Enjoy.  Every.  Bit.  Of.  It.  To.  I'll.  Come.  Again."}
{"text":"A fun time is to be had here. We enjoyed the design of the restaurant, the line dancing waitresses and the huge portions of food. My husband and I split an appetizer and an entree and had left overs for the next day.  The filet steak was tender and cooked perfectly. I'd recommend it. Don't risk having the sirloin, which is generally tougher and not marbled. If you're into it, the loaded sweet potato or loaded baked potato are delicious!   Our server was attentive and friendly. Despite it being crowded, we were served quickly and refilled on rolls and drinks twice.    It's always busy so they must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food! We didn't have a wait and everyone smiled during our entire service. I will most definitely frequent this location more!"}
{"text":"Okay so this is the story of when Applebees ran away to live in the Southwest... Except they seemed to have lost something on the way down. Granted, it's a Saturday afternoon during the lunch rush but it was the little things that just made it.... Meh.  When I walked into the restaurant I seemed to have broken the seating hostess; she just started at us until she realized she should seat us. Our waitress was nice enough when she finally showed up. We had to ask other servers for our silverware, straws, and the remaining parts of our meals. My glass was broken too... Found out the hard way.   Food was dry and boring. Don't order the green beans, for the love of god."}
{"text":"Let me just state that I am very picky when it comes to restaurants, mainly because I have been a server, trainer, and assistant manager before in this industry.  The few times we have gone - they have been professional, fun, and the food is amazing.  I have several severe food allergies, and I feel very comfortable eating here.  The staff is well trained, the food is cooked well."}
{"text":"Recently went here for my daughters Birthday. We called ahead to tell them we had a big party in which they told us they could accommodate. Well, this is where it all went bad. They have no room for a big party, wish they would have made that clear up front. When I asked to be put in a spot in which would have made sense they told me it was reserved. They stuck 13 of us in two booths that seat maybe 6 per table. and when a couple more showed up and they still could care less.. As far as the Management goes, we spent over three hundred dollars and he never once came by to see how things where going. He just didn't care. By the way. the area I asked for was never seated except for one small table. Very poor customer service. Only thing I can say was good was our waiter, he knew we were not happy but did his best to take care of us. I give him 5 stars, and the manager a big zero. I called corporate the next day, was told they would investigate and call me back. They never did. Beware of a establishment that cares less about its customers."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional, friendly staff. Food was good and came out In a timely matter. No complaints"}
{"text":"This place is fine for a quick stop on your way to Indiana, Chicago, or Kentucky, as we wanted something good to eat that wasn't fast food.    I didn't know that this place was a chain, but the place was packed, so we figured that people loved coming here.  I like the fact that you can order different types of sides with your meal options.  Sweet potatoes, steamed veggies, and a salad were okay.  I gave it a few stars because the service was great and they offer fresh options and varieties that most chains don't have.  Also, the price was super reasonable and we got a free appetizer.  If you don't mind a bit of country, try  it out."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Loved the atmosphere, not too bright, not too loud. Crystal was a great waitress. Thanks for a good experience."}
{"text":"The portobello mushroom chicken was surprisingly good, sweet potato was delicious. The service however was terrible. Good thing we enjoyed our food, not once did the server ask how the food was, in fact we didn't see her once after giving our order. Do not come here expecting above average service."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today. I have been to Texas Roadhouse before and its redeming qualities were missing.  The rolls were dark and on the hard side, like they had been reheated.  I had a sirloin, sweet potato and cooked carrots in lemon sauce. The veggie was the servers recommendation.  I got my steak med well, which they classify as pink in the middle. The steak was grey it was so cooked...almost like it was microwaved. The carrots on the other hand were not cooked and no lemon sauce in sight.  My husband and uncle like their food and our server was great, so a star for each of those.  Maybe lunch people get left overs."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurant chains due to great customer service and steak. I enjoyed the ribeye and a margarita with a shot of \"patron\" in there. There is normally a lengthy wait but bar is walk-in and I had zero wait . I ordered two meals plus two drinks and paid around 38 bucks. Not bad. Definitely recommend this chain location."}
{"text":"Food is decent but super unhappy because, we walked in the restaurant and it was cold but we just thought we would adjust but it stayed cold. When we sat down we still tried to wait and see if we would adjust to the temperature, we finally asked two servers to see if the air could be turned down because my nose is running and I don't want the air blowing on the food, one server even told me that there are a lot of complaints about it being cold in there and she even said that she is always cold. The waitress came back to tell us that it has been turned down but it wasn't we could feel the cold air the rest of the time there"}
{"text":"Called 10 minutes ahead of time was told to let them know when everyone was there then they decide to tell me that it would be an hour +. Mallory done this on purpose for reason I don't know why.  Our group was pushed back to wait on purpose because of size of group, had to wait over hour -14 minutes. Waitress had bit of attitude as if she didn't want to wait on our table. WILL NOT GO BACK FOR SURE"}
{"text":"Walking into Texas Roadhouse, I was immediately reminded of the beleaguered Loan Star steakhouse chain.  With its log cabin furnishings, large central bar and tex-mex motif, déjà vu started to set in rather quickly, and I began to quietly lower my expectations of this place.  However, I also had good reason to cast doubt aside, as this restaurant was near capacity when we arrived.  Friendly servers, clad in humbling \"I Love My Job\" t-shirts and blue jeans, buzzed around the cavernous, all-booth dining room with apparent efficency.  Our particular server was a lovely young woman who recited  menu items and offered suggestions in a well-meaning, albeit rehearsed manner, even going so far as to address me as \"sugar\", when taking my order, no doubt adhering to a training edict suggesting the practice of using terms of endearment to address customers; a common custom in parts of the southwest U.S.  When used in a chain restaurant setting in suburban Pittsburgh, it came across as uncomfortably forced.  Nevertheless, our service was outstanding, and she demonstrated a complete understanding of the menu, which should be expected at these price points.  The menu includes many popular steak cuts, including porterhouse, New York strip, prime rib, and fillets in a range of sizes, including medallions, with sautéed mushrooms and onions offered as the requisite add-ons. Sides are all \"made from scratch\", while burgers and sandwiches will sate the lunch crowd. Several chicken and seafood items are available for those who prefer lighter fare, along with absolutely succulent ribs and pulled pork.  A kids menu is available for the \"youngins\", along with a variety of southern-style cocktails for the 'elder folk.'  The Texas theme is ever-present at the Roadhouse. From the neon cowboy hat glowing atop the sign outside, to the menu's \"Dallas fillet\", the Lone Star state shines on in this loudy, rowdy joint.  At one point during our meal, the servers gathered near a booth somewhere across the room and began a raucous birthday song for a guest, which we were later told involved propping the celebrant atop a portable saddle during the performance...impromptu silliness reminiscent of \"Chi Chi's\"--fried ice cream not included...The noise level, in fact, was a bit excessive due to the music volume.  Lively music can enhance a dining experience, but should never take precedence over conversation. Fortunately, our booth ran along a short wall, offering a buffer against the ensuing din.  If you are looking for surprisingly decent steak, sides and service, by all means consider paying the Roadhouse a visit...if you want an intimate quiet dinner, keep roaming the prairie."}
{"text":"We ate there tonight with our two kids since it was kids eat free night.  Kim was our waitress.  She did a great job.  Drinks were always kept full.  The food was excellent.  The steaks were cooked perfectly.  I would highly recommend this Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Loud place. Home country cookin. Good eats. Not super high quality but very good for comfort food. Fun.  Not for those that dislike taxidermy on walls."}
{"text":"Left hungry.  Ordered food - asked for well done and medium well - we were served very rare meat.  Wine glass had about 3 ounces of wine in it.  We finished our drinks long before the food arrived and could not find anyone to get a us a glass of water to drink with our meals.  No salt on the table or any other table in the bar area (still no server to be found) so we walked around the restaurant and finally found a section that did have some.  We flagged down a bus boy and asked to speak to the manager.  A kitchen manager came out after several minutes and said the store manager wasn't available.  The kitchen manager agreed that the steaks were not cooked right but said she would not do anything about it.  We left without eating but still had to pay for it!  Very disappointed.  We will never go back.  This used to be one of our favorite places."}
{"text":"Just landed from Texas and my family and I were starving when we walked in to Texas Road House. We were seated and waited 15 minutes before leaving since no one had noticed our family of 5. This is no Texas Road House, come to Houston if you want to know what real hospitality looks like."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Texas Roadhouse, my family wanted to go for an early dinner.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  Our server was sweet and patient. They give you these hot rolls when you are seated with a sweet butter, they are good but dont eat too many or you wont eat yer supper ;)  There are also buckets of peanuts to snack on as well.  The sirloin was recommended and I was leary because sirloin tends to be chewy and dry, however, I was very happy when it came out and was perfectly pink and delicious.  The other diners with me had the roasted chicken which looked good and sweet potato as a side dish which was tasty.  I had lemonade and the server was quick to bring another at the sight of mine being 3/4 done which was great, it tasted homemade but I didnt ask if it was.  Overall a good experience"}
{"text":"Four of us waited too long to get seated, once seated  we were once again waiting for our food to arrive. We tried to give this establishment a chance to self correct but to no avail. They still have not learned from the reviews they consistently receive. SERVICE: Piss Poor at the very least. WAIT STAFF: Piss Poor, Matthew our server was deplorable, makes us wonder how he was raised in LOW DOWN AZ, food not fresh, hamburger bun hard as rock. did not come around to check on us and didn't offer any condiments. Bottom line the tip did not reflect the service. Matthew needs to find another line of work. Shame on TX Roadhouse for hiring such low quality employees, probably the pool of employable people are at the bottom of the barrel in AZ."}
{"text":"Good food, good service , reasonable prices. Been there twice and great both times. No wonder you have a wait no matter when you go"}
{"text":"I am done with this sorry, fast food restaurant.  The management appears to be very, very poor every time I have attempted to dine here.  I gave this place 4 chances!  The same manager is there too.  She is uncaring, unable to execute remedies to complaints landed in her lap and shows that she is uncaring that she do so.  One feels exceptionally devalued with her responses.  The service is poor too.  The steaks have either come to me over or undercooked, each and every time that I have dined there too!  I am just done!  Never returning!"}
{"text":"The only good part about my birthday dinner here was the sampler platter before the meal... it was freezing cold at our table (I guess they don't want people sitting there very long) and my new york strip steak was okay but needed more for flavor (bummer) and for my birthday acknowledgement I received no singing but some nasty fried sweet potatoes balls with whipped cream... rly dissapointing... so that will be my last trip to this place especially since birthdays are once a year and life is short ppl... I encourage you to go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"Just your average streak place. My parents eat here a bunch and they bring me along when i visit them. They only get 2 stars cause in a state like North Carolina if you only serve mass produced beers your doing something wrong."}
{"text":"Service was terrible! Sorry Courtney, it is managements responsibility to train you. You didn't even take our dirty plates away from us so we could have after dinner conversation."}
{"text":"We have dined at this location many times and have enjoyed their food.  I called today to ask what the ingredients are in their French fries since I have a child with a chronic illness who can sometimes eat French fries. I was careful to call during off peak hours so that the employee would be able to look up the ingredients. The caller abruptly and harshly told me that they would not tell me the ingredients because of copyright. I explained that my son had a very limited diet (ie pears and potatoes only) and he abruptly told me too bad. I was disappointed that as a consumer I am not even allowed to ask what the ingredients are in my food. That is so dangerous for anyone with diet restrictions.  Turns out it was just this location because when I called the location in Gilbert to ask the same question, they got me a manager who told me each ingredient. UPDATE: I emailed the gm and he promptly responded to my email with an email that included the ingredients that I was looking for and asking for the name of the person who had spoken to on the phone. He reassured me that they take allergies seriously and apologized for the experience that I had."}
{"text":"Reasonably good food. What you'd expect. Competent service .... but the place is really really loud!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was quick. Love the peanuts and appetizers. The Prime Rib was great! and gotta love a salted baked potato.. The background noise takes away from the music and performance of the dancing waiters."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Priced very well. I ordered the 6 oz sirloin with mashed potatoes and green beans. The steak was cooked perfectly! It was moist and succulent and well seasoned. Restaurant staff were friendly and outgoing. I would definitely recommend coming to this Texas Roadhouse!!!"}
{"text":"Overall we had a good experience. It was a pretty good value for the money. The steak was cooked just right and the kids meal was a good portion. But if it was a good experience, then why only three stars??? Well...  The waiter wasn't very attentive. We had to flag him down. The ribs were charred a bit too much.  The waiter asked if we wanted everything on the baked potato.. We replied yes. What we didn't know was he added the loaded option. I only realized what he did when I received the bill."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday with my wife. Had the chicken fried steak with cream gravy. Yum. Really good service. The bread rolls are awesome.  Really a great bargain here. Good food good prices great service."}
{"text":"Shannon was our server for Veterans Day and did an outstanding job. Pork chop and gravy were delicious. Love their baked potatoes. Will be back."}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience ever at the Texas Roadhouse Willoughby.    Called the establishment 3 times as they suggest all over their website and at the building itself?  We had a party of 10 meeting for Father's Day dinner.     We were not told our party would be split . We also had 2 different servers.  One table had drinks and the server was taking their food order.  The other table had not been served yet.   To make matters worse, a pipe above our table was dripping condensation on our table and in our drinks. We asked to speak to a manager and after an extended period and asking a second time for a manager,  When the manager finally showed up he couldn't understand why we didn't want condensation dripping in our drinks (food hadn't been served yet)He said it's just condensation and it's clean...REALLY?  We asked to speak to another manager.  After another extended period of time the \"owner\" finally came.  He also couldn't understand why we didn't want condensation dripping on us.  He finally offered a different table but our party would be separated.    The staff said the table was closed all day.  The owner told us that no one else had complained about the condensation.  When we said of course no one complained as the staff said the table was closed.  He said it wasn't closed so we asked why the staff would say that, his response \"they are lying to cover their butts\".  The server didn't seat us, why would they need to cover their butts...???  I would not recommend the Willoughby Texas Roadhouse location at all!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our anniversary dinner. An appetizer wasn't necessary, especially with the unlimited supply of peanuts and the delicious rolls with cinnamon butter. We both had the 8 oz. sirloin steak for $12.49 each, which included salads, along with a second side (my husband had corn and I had a baked potato with butter and sour cream). We each had two glasses of the house cabernet at $5.50 each. The waitress surprised us with a brownie covered in covered sauce for an anniversary, with other waitresses and waiters coming by to serenade us."}
{"text":"When to Texas Roadhouse for Fathers day told them we needed a table for six and a high chair. They tried to give us a booth when we had told them we needed a table. They said all they had were the high tables we said that was fine. Got the table and a high chair, someone from the wait staff came by and took the high chair away. We told them that we needed the high chair and they said we couldn't have it. So we left and went to Longhorn Steak house and got treated better by the wait staff."}
{"text":"This place is so nasty and completely over priced... The ribs are boiled and disgusting.. I would never recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Order something else besides steak.  Cannot cook a medium steak even when butterflied. Blossom was good though."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight with a party of 7. Waited only about 5 minutes.                                                                             The only issue was 7 people in a booth isnt ideal.             ****************************************************** The waitress was quick and on the spot with rolls and drinks and she kept the table as free of clutter as she could.  Everyone's food came out perfect. We ordered the sirloin,  ribs, chicken and prime rib dinners.  All in all it was a great dinner:)"}
{"text":"Not a place you can go if you have severe peanut allergies unfortunately.  However, for the rest of us we can all enjoy this wonderful place!   Last year TX roadhouse exploded big time in AZ opening up numerous locations across town.   This location in Arrowhead is ideally located right across from the Peoria Stadium Sports complex on '83'.  One of the older established, well run locations where you will always meet a friendly, happy crew to wait on you.   As you walk in you are not only met with a friendly welcome and all you can eat peanuts while you wait, you also get to meet the meat in the fridge and see the cuts.   RIBBED for your pleasure! Not being a sauce person everything i order is cooked plain and I have to say their ribs are not only one of the greatest full rack prices I have seen, but also for just smoked meat; they are really great!  Falling off the bone? sure sometimes its like the meat is treating the bone as the annoying little brother and doesn't want anything to do with it!  On a budget or do not want a full rack, they have an appetizer size of the ribs!  Again with the fussy eating, I do not eat potatoes so this is one of the places in town that i can get a baked sweet potato!   Baked potatoes are also great (so i am told) but vegatarians beware TX R uses bacon grease on the potato skins, something that we only just found out :(.    Oh did I mention the peanuts? they are at every table and bar stool too.    I also recommend,   Snake Bites!  Cactus Blossom (blooming onion equivalent.,   Salmon, great steaks (for the price range probably the best meat for the value) Forth worth Ribeye & bone in Ribeyies have always been great.   From a vegetarian point of view, they also have a dish on the menu where you can order 4 sides (including 1 salad) for a good price.   There is a decent sized bar area where you can sit, drink, eat peanuts and watch about 10 TVs.   Do you have a cowboy/cowgirl birthday coming up?  tell the server and your Bday victim will be given a hat to wear and a wooden horse to sit on while they whole team announces the birthday!  The staff seem really highly trained and always happy to be there for you, even if something was missed or not to your liking, (which is really rare).  The company prides itself on supporting VETs and numerous charities.  Oh yeah, did i mention free yummy peanuts!   Good food, good price, take out and call ahead makes this an ideal quick no brainier for us when it comes to being flexible!"}
{"text":"Don't understand why it takes 45 min for two to go dinners called in when there is no one waiting to be seated when I got there 20 min after I called it in."}
{"text":"I love Texas Road House and this location did not disappoint. The wait at 5pm on a Friday was 30mins! The place was BUSY but probably because the food and service was spot on. Our server was friendly and we couldn't have been more happy with her. The food was prompt and delicious. My steak was cooked perfectly and I'm pretty picky with my steak expecting it to not be over cooked. My children really enjoy the rolls and they kept them coming with out us even having to ask. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"This location usually has a 20-30 minute wait time. They offer call-ahead seating so we try to utilize that.  This is a decent restaurant chain in my opinion. Lots of flair, fun and frivolity each time we visit. The steaks are great, the beer is cold and the music is right! Plus the staff is friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price.  Have visited a couple of times. The complimentary bread is nice and we like the shrimp starter. The main courses are good too and the ambience is not bad."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for her birthday earlier this year. It was my first visit to a Texas Roadhouse in a while, as I'm the first to admit that I'm not enough of a carnivore to be a regular at this particular chain. (I don't avoid it by any means, I just don't frequent it, either.)   For my dinner I ordered a BBQ chicken combo with ribs, which was a decent choice. The ribs are the primary reason I'm leaning toward \"ok\" on the food. They were tender and enjoyable enough, but I had hoped for a little more flavor in them, as ribs are a rare treat for me. The chicken ended up being the more memorable part of the combo, as it was perfectly cooked with the right amount of seasoning and sauce - very tasty.  As for the service, our waitress left a great impression. She was attentive, and she happily put in for a replacement steak when my friend's medium rare order came out well done. A replacement was brought to us by a manager who wanted to make sure the meal as a whole was satisfactory, so clearly the staff were paying attention to their restaurant that night. It was nice to see that given the number of other complaints on Yelp about incorrectly cooked orders.  Based on the food and service during my visit, Texas Roadhouse is a solid 3.5 in my book. The service was definitely good. Admittedly some of my food was more on the \"meh\" side; but considering how affordable this place is for the amount of food that I got, the combo was still a good deal overall. (Since the combo came with a couple sides of my choice as well, I ultimately boxed up about half of the meat for later.) I would definitely consider returning if the right mood struck me - particularly since I know they'd fit into my budget more easily than other steakhouses and BBQ establishments."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant to celebrate my daughter's birthday. Our server, Mike was welcoming and friendly. We ordered 3 specialty lemonades. They were all flavorful, but I especially liked the Blue Lemonade and the Strawberry Lemonade. They had peanuts in shells in a bucket, and warm bread with cinnamon butter waiting for us at the table. Nice touch. I liked this location better because there wasn't too much shell debris on the floor.  We had a coupon for an appetizer, so we ordered the Blooming Cactus. We enjoyed two orders of Caesar Salad and a House Salad with a tasty homemade Ranch dressing. For our main meals, we had a huge rack of ribs that we shared and also a 16 oz rib eye steak that was cooked to perfect medium rare. So far so good. The loaded baked potato was also lovely. The mashed potatoes with gravy was okay. The chili my son had some robust flavors working to is favor. Our favorite item was the sauteed mushrooms. Yum! I could've enjoyed two servings. The sad dish was served to our guest of honor: smothered chicken. They did not serve it with the cheese or the sauce. We returned it, and it looked like it was microwaved. That made the dish utterly unappetizing, and she hardly touched it. I ended up taking it home to be re-purposed.   Mike honored our coupon and gave us $5 off our bill. We used a gift card and paid the balance off. It was a nice meal except for that one dish. We will be back."}
{"text":"My first Texas Roadhouse experience was alright. The steaks were well-seasoned and cooked well to my medium-rare specification. At first the peanut-shell on the floor was a fun novelty, but after a while, it was a little disconcerting as I considered the trash all around. It wasn't for me. It was also very loud, and I realize that it was not my favorite ambiance to enjoy steak. I wonder if it is quieter during lunch time."}
{"text":"The service and food was really good. My only complaint it's very loud in there, so it's hard to talk."}
{"text":"Texas-sized wait for a table (one of only places left in desolate Elyria).  Got table in bar, games on tvs and nice server.  Got tenders / sirloin combo. Meats cooked right. Love their honey mustard. Side salad was nicely loaded, chili was chunky.  Steamy Sweet Rolls w cinnamon butter is always a hit!  Wife's salmon was bit fishy, but sweet potato was a fluffy delight. So much we had some doggie bags. In & out in an hour flat on a Friday night.. Dang!"}
{"text":"I. love. this. restaurant.  Seriously.  When my wife and I were first dating she asked me to surprise her for dinner. Her one condition for this date was that they needed to have good bread. Two restaurants ran through my head: Texas Roadhouse and Olive Garden.  My wife is Italian and at the time I didn't know about her fiery distain for Olive Garden. Boy am I glad that I chose Texas Roadhouse.  The first thing served is a basket of hot, fresh-baked bread with some of the best cinnamon butter ever. After that bread basket everything else was just additional. My wife and I split the Filet Medallions (a regular dish that we order now) with mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes. Heaven on earth."}
{"text":"Called for a reservation for 8 last week. Told to call one hour before we were coming. We called one hour before to confirm, arrived on time, and we were told to sit and wait while they sat everyone who came through the door (40 to 50 people) When we asked what was going on we were told our party of 8 had only 6 people and we had to wait until all of our party were present before they would attempt to seat us. Their policy made no rational sense in that they were missing all of the cocktail and hors d'oeuvres business as well as our time to review their menu. When we were finely seated we ordered the 20 ounce prime rib with two sides and two glasses of Merlot. The plating was sloppy, one plate had the entire side of au jus spilled on it, the horse radish ordered was missing, all of this was accompanied by poor service. The next time we want to throw away $84.00 on a forgettable meal and restaurant we will choose to go elsewhere.  P.S  .If  you love to scream to be heard you will like this place. The only place louder is the Cardinals stadium during their touchdowns!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place. They are always friendly. I get to-go stuff too it's very good. I've had the strip steak which was awesome and I've had a couple different burgers which I heard were good so I had to try them. There salads are good and I like rattlesnake bites for my appetizer. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Terrible. My wife got the pork chops which were raw throughout.  I had the ribs. Very dry and tough to chew. The service was ok but not good. They make the servers do a weird line dance which is annoying when you need to tell the server about the raw pork. I guess their motto is -- salmonella won't kill you!  Maybe they had an off night, but I won't be back to try again. Plenty of other places around that look the same and have much better food -- right across the street in fact."}
{"text":"1. Complimentary first time customer sampler was nice. Chilly was delicious. No beans with medium spicy.  Green beans were excellent too.   2. Rolls were a little dry and cinnamon butter made it all better.   3. Ribeye steaks were good.  7 of 10 quality. Good for the price.    4. Great customer service"}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse used to be one of my go to places for a decent meal on a weekend of running errands. Today I sat down with my girlfriend and we started to order drinks...I was advised that we could not order a margarita with a shot of Cointreau in it. Not allowed per corporate guidelines. I could add in their kicker for $2 more but according to the Bar manager and their corporate responsibility guidelines. No customer can order two drinks at a time. Nor, increase the alcohol content of any drink unless preapproved.  Just to qualify: I drink seldom and I never drink to get drunk. I've never heard of such a thing, ever. So...I will drink my glass of water today and eat my meal. However this will be my dead last visit to Texas Roadhouse ever. They've lost me as a customer. There are other dining choices and I will go where I can drink what I want.   Goodbye!"}
{"text":"Knowing what I know, I should Know better. It has been a while since I have been to a restaurant like this. Logan's Roadhouse, Roadhouse Grill and Texas Roadhouse are all one in the same. There actually is some kind of extended founding member split apart and competed with one another type relationship. Anyway we went for lunch and I remembered pretty quickly \"Oh yeah I do not like these places\". Ribs were actually DRY. Yes Dry. They were tender just DRY. Baked potato was old. The texture was dry as if it was a re-heated potato..maybe it wasn't but it tasted and appeared as if it was. Ribs were not heated through. I know thy just grill them to finish them to order but they needed another few minutes on the grill. Caesar dressing tasted like ranch dressing. All in all..yeah yeah yeah the schtick of peanuts on the floor and meh food. If you think it is so great I am sure Olive garden and Red Lobster also appreciate your business. That does not make any of them good !"}
{"text":"We use to go here when we lived in TX. The food at this one seems to be consistent with our other location. Come here if you want a good affordable steak! I usually get the steak medallion kabob and loaded baked potato. The bread and garlic butter they bring to the table is delicious."}
{"text":"Consistanly great steaks and flavor for sure.  Today was our maybe 10th visit to Texas RH and we keep coming back.  Today's waitress Stacie was an absolute DITZ and let's just say it's a good thing I was in a good mood.  My Ribeye was as tender and tasty as I expect, wife tried the Ribs for the 1st time and they were tender for sure.  Bring your appetite and some time (if you come Fri/Sat after 530) as I am sure you will enjoy as well!"}
{"text":"Service is always top notch and food is second to none. If you have not had the pork chops you don't know what your missing"}
{"text":"I have since visited this location twice after my initial review. I should mention I was contacted by the GM through a private message from my initial review. I accepted the offer to revisit this location in hopes they could earn my business again.  Both times it was my wife and I and we sat at the bar. Shanda the bartender was there both times and she was great! Tentative and made sure we enjoyed ourselves! Actually remembered us from the first visit. These two visits were a drastic improvement from before. Granted initially it was a group of 6 and this time 2 people. We will continue to go back until something further happens."}
{"text":"I love the place and the food but I  think it's very disappointing tthis year for Veterans Day that they are not serving military spouses. What change from last year to this year. Very unhappy  about this."}
{"text":"21 Year Veteran whose Daughter took him to lunch yesterday for Veteran's day. The Server's name slips my mind, but she had the row of booths on the right side of the bar when you come in and she was the BEST Server that I have had in a LONG TIME. Professional, attentive and even wanted to Shake My hand and Thank Me for My Service as we were leaving... which was a First for Me. The food was Excellent and I had an very pleasant experience and will be back real soon. Thank You."}
{"text":"Food was decent, but the noise?? This is hands down the noisiest restaurant I've ever been to. Word to the wise, check the acoustics."}
{"text":"The worst service ever! Then charged extra for blue cheese crumbles on a salad that was listed on the menu. Sorry Bailey."}
{"text":"Oh my God!  This place rocks. And our Server Monique is the best. She was very attentive to every thing my wife and I needed. The food was perfect!  I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his birthday.  We both love barbeque and our favorite rib place has gone out of business in Arizona, so at the recommendation of a friend we decided to try Texas Roadhouse instead.  It was a Friday night and we had to wait for about 45 minutes.  In the waiting room they offer peanuts to munch on while you wait, and everyone just throws the peanut shells all over the floor.  So don't be shocked by the atmosphere.  I\"m not a peanut fan and it made me feel a little uncomfortable crunching on peanut shells as I walked, but my husband loved it.    The food, though... the food won me over.  SOOOOOO GOOD!!!!  We will definitely be eating there again.  I can easily say this is our new favorite restaurant!    It was funny, too.  When they found out it was my husband's birthday, they made him sit on a saddle and sang to him, and brought him a complimentary dessert.  I laughed and laughed at that!  (Remind me never to go there on my birthday! LOL)  My only complaint is that the table that we sat at had no light overhead and was pretty dark.  It was pretty busy, though, and our waitress was great!  And the food is worth the cost of peanut shells stuck to my shoes.  Oh man, that food was good!"}
{"text":"Well  what can I say catfish horrible . Had to ask for butter for my bread had to ask for peanuts . My grandson chicken meal was almost  burn  so sad this place is down the street from our house and  I will never come back. Waitress was horrible as well no knowledge  . Against will never come back ever  . I would rate them a negative one but I had to put one star"}
{"text":"First off, DeShawn is awesome, probably the best waiter I have ever had at this location. He was efficient and down to earth and made the evening a positive experience for myself and my kids. We will definitely ask for his section again. I deducted stats because of the stupid policy about not seating until everyone is there. We had a party of 10 for a birthday and I was arriving 15 min later due to work. They would not seat everyone else until I got there, even though they would have ordered right away. When a party is that large, 1 person should not hold up seating everyone. They didnt even seat us at one table, we were split in 2. Why does 1 seat not being filled for a few minutes matter when they would have filled 2 tables anyway? Anyhow, DeShawn was great, the food was good, but the seating policy sucks. Regardless of that, we will return."}
{"text":"My family and I go out a lot Texas Roadhouse is a place we like to go to really good service and food is great! The dancing is very entertaining they all have to take classes on line dancing just fun!"}
{"text":"Everytime I visit Texas Road House I indulge in their hot sweet bread :)  The steak is always good and very affordable! I tried a fruity Margarita for the first time here a few nights ago and loved it! I have visited multiple locations and would recommend them all. Great time, good food and nice fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite location. We sit at the bar and order there. We have only ever been disappointed here once but management handled that and it's been smooth sailing since. We've been going to this location for years, and this only happened one time in many many years. An awesome place for date night or to bring family. Exceptional food and margaritas on the rocks are always amazing. I would recommend this location to everyone. Very family friendly."}
{"text":"Always a great place to come. Anniversary dinner was great. Love coming here. Not always great customer services when you're entering..  girls always seem so frantic and hectic they can't ever greet you w good smiling faces."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if there is new management or a new cook but my past 3 visits have been horrible. This last time I was in was the absolute worst. The server forgot to put in our appetizer so we got it at the same time our food came. My friends steak was WAY undercooked it took almost 45mins for her to get it cooked longer. I was already done eating by the time she got her food. This happened the past two times we've been there!! The waitress was extremely slow. I sat there with no water for 15-20mins. We lost our keys and the lady at the front could have cared less. Didn't want to help us find them at all. When I asked again she seemed annoyed. I understand they were busy however as a returning customer who would come in often I feel we should all get good service. I will most likely but be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time because my friend recommended it. I was not disappointing I ordered the chicken fried steak and oh my god. it was phenomenal. Honestly the best one I have ever got from a restaurant. The service was fantastic and I look forward to coming back"}
{"text":"Seated much fast than was estimated. Server, Lisa was very attentive and nice. Excellent dining experience and food is always great here. Chicken portion was significantly smaller than Texas road house in Denver but still tasted graat"}
{"text":"Started out great...but the waitress lost interest. It was our third visit here and again third time with no prime rib. Our waitress decided to take a smoke break before our food came out and right after we ordered some drinks. She stated another waiter was going to take care of us while she stepped outside. Apparently the other waiter wasn't happy as we saw and heard him complain to another employee. We waited a very long time for our drinks and finally asked the waiter that covered for our smoke breaker for them.  When our food arrived one order was completely wrong and another was missing a side. Too bad:( we like the place and definitely started out good but went downhill"}
{"text":"Don't they line dance anymore? Have been to a couple different Roadhouses lately and didn't dance at either.  Ordered pulled pork and it was as good as from most bbq joints. Wasn't mushy, had some crusty pieces in there and not too much fat. Tasted great. Usual rolls, salad and sweet potato good as always."}
{"text":"This is the second time we been here and so far the food has been the best one. For the second time I have got the 16 oz rib eye and the meat is soft juicy and delicious. I really recommend this place. Servers are nice and always check with you, for a busy place it only took us like around 15 mins to get seated and this is on a Friday!!"}
{"text":"I have been on a steak kick lately and Texas road house did a great job at fixing that and more. I love the ambiance of the place and once you are seated the service is pretty fast. We made sure to make reservations for Saturday night because this place gets packed! The food was delicious! The steak was overcooked but the manager fixed that right away with a new steak for my husband and I. We will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Im reading through these reviews and am shocked there are one and two stars! I love this location! Come here every chance i get and am not sure why i havent left a review yet. I have never had a bad experience here! I bring all my family for birthdays, special occasions, etc! Everything is always perfect! Affordable prices, fantastic atmosphere, and steaks cooked to perfection every time!"}
{"text":"Matt was our server tonight and he was the best server I've ever had, my drink was never empty!! Love love love him and my food! Best service I've had in awhile and I'll most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I came for just dessert (and the complimentary bread and butter!) while in town from California. It was a quick date, but much needed. We were sat quickly and our server was quick. I got apple pie with a scoop of ice cream and my husband got a slice of cheesecake. Everything was very good."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We were very disappointed in the one on Power, the One in Gilbert restored our faith in Rosdhouse"}
{"text":"Me encanta este lugar cada vez que visito esta ciudad. Invitamos a los amigos a pasar un grato momento y cenar los deliciosas carnes."}
{"text":"My husband always enjoys the Prime Rib, and I love their Chicken Tender Salad.  This last time we went, it was around 5pm- much earlier than normal.  This gave us food that wasn't as warm as it should be, we're not sure if it was the time of day or if it was just a bad day.  Normally, they're tasty and good, this time, it was just ...meh."}
{"text":"Every time I have been here it has been a wonderful experience. The steaks (even the sirloin) are the best I've ever had. It's the only place that you don't need steak sauce to give it flavor. My favorite is the Dallas Filet. I've also had the pulled pork here and it's better than some of the BBQ places in town. The rolls with cinnamon butter are super yummy. Service has always been great and never been pushed out the door. The prices aren't too shabby either for the quality of food that you get. They could probably use a bigger parking lot, but folks don't mind parking in the grass to get this great food."}
{"text":"Service not so good at this location steak came not really hot, potatoes were okay but not as hot as they should of been, waitress was slow to check on us, the Gilbert location is always right on maybe just a bad night here"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here on New Year's Eve, and everything was delicious. There was a long wait (30-40 minutes), but we called ahead to put our name on the list and only had to wait about 10 minutes once we arrived.   The fried pickles are tasty (and cheap at only $5), and their bread is amazing. I'm not too picky when it comes to steak, and my sirloin was cooked to perfection. This place had a super fun atmosphere, and our server was really friendly. I'd definitely recommend coming here for a good time when you're in the mood for some steak. The prices are about average in comparison to other steakhouse chains, but I personally think it's a lot more fun and upbeat here."}
{"text":"My buddy, Matt took me this restaurant and it was great. All around great food and great service. Janelle and Derek were amazing servers."}
{"text":"The food is always great but the customer service, especially for a Mother's day evening, has left much to be desired. Our waitress was very snippy and short tempered. I get it, it's been a \"long day\" (according to her 'manager') but to me that's not an excuse for poor customer service. Our table was never clean unless another waitress came along to clear the table. Infact it took 4 additional waitresses to get our experience to an acceptable level. Waiters/ waitresses have the ability to determine your night out so even a hint of 'bad attitude' is a turn off. ESPECIALLY ON MOTHER'S DAY."}
{"text":"$2 Margarita Tuesdays equals automatic 4 stars! Solid staple chain restaurant, always get what is expected and most days that's good enough!!"}
{"text":"During my time at \"Texas Roadhouse\" it was extremely delicious. From the complimentary bread to the grilled shrimp with the bread on the side. The waitress was kind of rude with a hint of sarcasm. But the food was still good!"}
{"text":"My husband brought me here last night to celebrate Mother's Day. There was quite a crowd and we were told that is we wanted to be seated sooner, we could choose the patio. It was starting to cool down, so we decided that would be fine. We were served blueberry lemonade as we waited outside under the misters, that was an awesome touch. A waitress came by offering menus so that people could choose what they wanted prior to being seated. Our orders were written on a slip of paper that we were instructed to hand to our server at our table. It only took about 30 minutes to get a table. This outdoor section is much quieter than inside and there is more space between tables, it is very intimate, but you can still enjoy the ambiance of the place. Our dinner was amazing as always, and our server Krista was fantastic. Our drinks came out almost immediately, followed very quickly by our salads. BY the time we were nearly finished with our salads, our steaks were delivered. We didn't have time to need anything else. The service was absolutely outstanding! Thank you so much for a great date night out Krista! You went above and beyond for us."}
{"text":"FRIED PICKLES. 'NUFF SAID! ;D  No, when it comes to a fried pickle, tho, and my sister and I have sampled a lot, nothing beats a Texas Roadhouse fried pickle. -heart- Creamy ranch, golden batter, and the pickle isn't lost in the whole thing!    Much like most of their fare, food is simple, unassuming, love of the land kind of grub.  Sure, there's peanut shells under foot, and people yelling 'Yeehaw!', but that doesn't detract from a diverse menu just filled with amazing options!  It's really the ambiance, and the warmth of this place that lends to its charm.  Priced right around the $10-$15 a plate, you'll take home leftovers (a promise!), and you'll leave stuffed.  You can even drink, here, without breaking the bank!  Like I said, while this food is pretty stellar all the way around, the place only loses a star for its... well, ambiance and charm.  LOL.  Those things are so perfectly fine and if you're comfortable with a boot scoot going on about ten fingers' width from your table, this experience is for you!  However, if you're looking for elegance  and up-scale fine-dinery... pass on by!  If I didn't say it before, GET A FRIED PICKLE (basket)! ;D"}
{"text":"Oh yuck. Not impressed by any means. The onion turned my stomach and made me so sick. I couldn't even eat my pulled pork sandwich. Not one bite. Spent dinner in bathroom while my family enjoyed my nieces birthday. Kids loved it. Waiter and waitress that helped us (party of 16) were fantastic, cheery and fun. Very attentive to our table. My niece loved sitting on the saddle. Hey that's why we were here, I didn't even know the place existed. To be far I am not really a fan of BBQ. I won't be back but I am sure the rest will. The place was pretty large and every table full. Food came out pretty quickly."}
{"text":"The PROs: Reasonably priced; Generous sides; Service can be quite good (though it seems either great or terrible and nothing in between).  The CONs: The place gets hideously noisy, especially with the stomping line dancing by the waitstaff. That and the loud music are not conducive to table conversation; Steaks are flavorless (Upper Midwest types like my father-in-law love bland, though, and I'm not from here); Liked it a lot better before they crammed a lot more tables into the table area, as if they took lessons from the airlines; They have prime rib on the menu yet often don't have rare or medium rare available; Waitstaff service can be very spotty, so don't count on drink refills. This is a go-to place when my father-in-law is with us; Otherwise I'll pass."}
{"text":"Had a great time with the family, the food was good. The service was good, our server was just a bit too high strung but other then that I'd go back."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful, had leftovers as always! Hostess was very nice, the smaller blonde young lady. Our waiter Christian was on top if it! Didn't have to ask for refills, was very courteous, and checked in just the right amount. Wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Great experience, all around. High-energy kids are sweet and very attentive. Thanks, TRH."}
{"text":"It's a quite energetic western environment. The food was really good. Their rolls with cinnamon butter were amazing. Our server was friendly and attentive. I would definitely come back just for the rolls. I recommend the ribeye steak cooked medium well. The flavor was so good and it was almost melt in your mouth soft."}
{"text":"We had eaten at this restaurant in May while here on vacation and had great service and food. Tonight we went back and my husbands 12 oz New York Steak had fat around all if the edges and about 1/3rd of the steak at the end was nothing but gristle and fat. When you pay for a great steak the last four inches should not be entirely fat! Did the cooks not even look at the piece of meat they were throwing on he grill? What's even worse even worse is the fact that when our waitress came back at the end of the meal and we pointed out the supposed to be steak that was just fat that he had left on the plate, she said  \" oh that's too bad\" and picked up the plate and left the bill. No \" I'll tell the cooks\" or anything remotely acknowledging that it was a bad steak. The bill was $100 that we would have been happy to pay for great steaks, but not for a pile of gristle and fat."}
{"text":"Dinner last night was a great experience,  my prime rib was cooked to perfection. The rib eye my wife had was great.  My nephew ordered sirloin with melted blue cheese,  all the food was expertly presented. The salad was fresh and crisp.  The servers were on time and not over bearing. Great dining experience."}
{"text":"Steak was fair as usual. They just don't quite get it right at this location. Our server, Austin, however, was awesome. If it weren't for him, I probably would have made more of a fuss. Thanks Austin for making it enjoyable."}
{"text":"The 6oz Dallas cut is great.  The most tender of the filets they offer. The mushrooms where $2 extra and really not needed.  The meat is seasoned well and delicious.  A nice side of veggies with the side salad made this meal delicious without weighing you down/"}
{"text":"Wow, what happened?  The last time we came here (before yesterday) was four years ago, and it was the worst experience we have ever had in a restaurant, bar none.  Well, someone told us the restaurant had changed hands and to try it again.  Boy am I glad we did!!!  The steak was so tender you could cut it with a butter knife, the sides and bread were above board, and the service was exceptional!  The restaurant was packed, yet we were seated immediately and we watched as the tables were instantly turned over as soon as the diners departed.  I haven't had this good a steak in a long while and it completely beat the last great steak I had, which was at a restaurant called The Woodshed, a restaurant owned by locals in a neighboring town that prides itself on its steak, plus it's CHEAPER.  So we basically got upscale steak house dining for a pretty great price.  We're definitely going back!  Oh, and a note to the prior poster on here complaining about the ID problem.  I don't see why you should complain and give a bad review to a restaurant that was basically obeying the LAW.  I don't care if your wife looks like she's eighty; the wait staff acted appropriately.  Shame on you!"}
{"text":"Sweet amazing bread as you walk in, All you can eat peanuts! One of the best steaks, and the best service by waitress Samantha! What else can you ask for? First time here and def adding as a favorite"}
{"text":"Oh mah gah.   First time here and at first glance it appeared to be your typical run-of-the-mill chain steakhouse. As soon as we walked in, at least two hostesses greeted us right away. We were given a buzzer only to be seated like 30 seconds later anyway. Awesome!   We immediately were served a basket of warm rolls and cinnamon crack butter. I ate so much of this I barely had room for dinner. Our waiter, Derek, was the cutest little thing. He was super attentive, despite the restaurant being very busy on a weekend. We ordered drinks which were delivered quickly. Refills too. Derek was on it. More rolls and crack butter.   Our food came out, super hot and delicious. I ordered the sirloin and bbq chicken. Hot damn. My steak was cooked perfectly! Literally no fat on it, and even being well-done it was delicious. The fries even had their own flavor. Drool. I'm a fry fanatic and most places don't seem to give much thought to their fries, as they're often a side dish. These were cooked perfectly and well-seasoned. They make their own ranch and that is tasty as well. Thick and creamy and very ranchy. Love. Oh, here comes Derek with refills! Do we require more rolls and crack butter? Surewhynot.   Overall excellent experience. The hospitality was awesome. Everything very reasonably priced and worth it. They even have peanuts in buckets at each table should you choose to snack on those as well.   Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Server was super rude to me and my family. It was a busy night when we walked in, but that is no excuse for her terrible attitude. I really think she should consider another job, anything that doesn't have to do with \"customer service\". When the food came out, we told the server about our time constraint because my brother needed to be somewhere at a certain time. As a server myself, it is reasonable to let the server know about time constraints, no matter how busy it is. And we were super polite when we let her know. She snapped back at us and said, \"Really?! Youre asking me to hurry?! That is so rude.\" Rolled her eyes and walked away to talk crap right in front of us to the manager. The manager came over and asked us if we wanted a new server. I said, I only want a new server if she doesn't want us. Sure enough, a new girl comes up to take care of us for the night. Correct me if im wrong, but we got denied service by a server who didnt understand a simple request. Rule #1 of serving handbook: Never deny service unless guest is drunk or harassing you. I will be back, but I really think they need to reconsider their wait staff. Maybe hire some new servers who can give good service during a busy night. I have never in all my years been mistreated like that when out to eat."}
{"text":"You have to try the California chicken salad!  The perfect mix of flavors. I am affraid I will crave this one."}
{"text":"We had the prime rib it was very good, not like other places we've been to. The service was excellent. Like the line dance the employees did. All in all had a great time with our guest's from out of town. Good bar"}
{"text":"A well oiled machine.  I just left this Texas Roadhouse on a Friday night on a race weekend no less and it was a perfect experience.  Our waitress was very attentive, the food arrived very fast, and the entire restaurant was very well run.  You guys are amazing!"}
{"text":"Really like texas road house very good food and the rolls are the best with the honey butter the food is just that good everu time i go to texas road house."}
{"text":"Angie and I had a craving, one only a slab of beef could satisfy. We took ourselves to the local Gastonia Texas Roadhouse. We are big fans of the chain, and decided to roll the bones and try the one close to home.      We were surprised, not disappointed in Texas Roadhouse, but pleasantly surprised. For a reason I cannot name, we have been disappointed in some national chains in the Gastonia area. Service has been the biggest culprit, thus our pleasant surprise.      Restaurant was clean and inviting. We chose to leave selecting our steaks to fate. Angie had a beautiful Ribeye with Mushrooms. It was cooked as she requested and our Waitress provided us with the sauces, sides and other fixings we desired. We asked a lot, but tipped her well. Service was very good, food well cooked and flavorful. We left agreeing that we would be back when the need for beef set us to prowl."}
{"text":"Believe me, I would much rather write great reviews than bad ones. But sometimes an experience leaves you SO disappointed that you have to share.  So I'll just dive right in. After a relatively short wait for a Saturday night, we were seated. Before we had a chance to get the kids settled and scoop up a menu, our waitress was asking for our drink orders. No big deal, she's on her toes today! Thirty seconds after putting in our drinks she came to take our order. I asked for a few minutes to actually look at the menu. She turned around, checked on another table, and asked us if we were ready yet \"because she's really busy tonight.\" Again, we asked her to please give us a few minutes. She came back 26 minutes later.  Once we got our food (yay!), I cut into my steak. Unfortunately I had ordered medium rare, and this steak was extremely well done. While the rest of my family ate their food, I waited. And waited. And waited for her to return.  When she finally did, I told her about the steak. She proceeded to take her phone out of her pocket, turns the flashlight on and shines it into my face while asking what I wanted her to do about it. Shielding my eyes, I told her again, it was over cooked. She took a look at it and said, \"Fine, but it's going to be about 20 minutes.\" Then she took my whole plate, including the potato I was actually eating. At this point, I'm going to call her out.  Mary-Anne, maybe find a more suitable career.  By this time my entire family was done eating. 15 minutes go by. Then another 15 minutes. At 36 minutes she brings me a new steak (this one was cooked perfectly) and hands us our bill.  I hadn't EATEN YET. While I tried to scarf down some potato before my young children fell asleep, she returned for the bill.  I couldn't even take another minute, so we paid for four meals (including one I didn't get to eat, and left.) Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Okay, it's a chain. I get it. You expect hit or miss times if you go often enough. That being said this particular location gets worse with each visit. The food quality has dropped and the prep of the food is even worse. Portions are rather inconsistent  as well. Not sure what is going on at this unit but it definitely needs work. Maybe I'm the one that is goofy because this place seems very busy most times. Perhaps it is the BOOMING loud atmosphere. Peanuts? Could it be the constant singing and jumping around of the staff? Whatever it is, I have dropped this place way down on my list. For a few bucks more you can find a much better product and a more suitable atmosphere in which to consume it. Dinner for two ran $50 before tip with no alcohol and one app which was a grease soaked (and I mean soaked) blooming onion. Do what you will but don't get into a car accident rushing to the Bridgeville Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Now, I know that Texas Roadhouse ain't what's known as a local joint, but YEEEEEHAW, y'all, they serve powerful tasty vittles and don't make ya pay through the nose for 'em, neither.  Me and The Wife have gone to this here dinin' establishment several times, now, and each time we receive a heap o' great cookin'. Sure 'nough, there's food aplenty before y'all's seat is even ready: they got peanuts in barrels in the waitin' area, and ya just throw the shells on the floor when yer done -- this place don't pretend to be somethin' it ain't!  Then, when the fine young folk take ya to your seat, they slap down a basket o' the grandest, most bully bread buns and cinnamon spread this side o' the Mississippi. Now, me and The Wife call them there buns \"crack buns\" 'cause they are so darn addictin', and, truth be told, we always have the server fetch us an extra basket or two.  Pretty much every time I go to the Roadhouse, I get the same darned thing: a 10 oz. Ft. Worth Ribeye - medium rare - with a salad and sauteed onions on the side (I must admit, though, that I sure am partial to the steak fries, so I do switch 'er up every once in a harvest moon). They cook up the steak right proper every time, and it is always better than any steak I've had elsewhere (even better, I swear, than them steaks I've had in them fancy restaurant establishments up in the big city o' Madison). The flavor does hit the salt a little hard sometimes, but ask for some raw horseradish on the side, and you'll go home even happier than a dog on the hunt.  If yer lookin' to go on a bender, or jus' want to bend yer elbow, there's a bar servin' all manner o' spirits: the fine folks takin' yer order are happy to bring ya some soda, beer, wine, or liquor.  And, if it's yer birthday, the staff'll shine a light in yer face, scream some words at ya, and make the whole restaurant yell a big ol' YEEEHAWWW for ya."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness... we love this place! We go once or twice a week!  Service is always amazing and food is always perfection! Honestly,I husband and I are so happy we stumbled upon this place. When we don't have the kids we sit at the bar and the bartenders are always super friendly and attentive. They actually remember us by face! And when we have our kids the servers in the main restaurant are always friendly. We can't thank management enough for doing what they are doing. It's clearly working! We just love this place so much."}
{"text":"The service was fine but the food was inedible, unless you are a dog. My steak tasted like leather, the shrimp was greasy and the French fries were soggy.  My dog loved the steak."}
{"text":"Great place for food.had bbq  chicken and steak great salad. Love the tools and the peanuts  I had the baked potato as well was so good."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday for dinner with my wife after checking the reviews and I have to say- I can't believe we waited so long to check this place out.  Our experience was about as good as it can get for a reasonable steak dinner.  Our waitress Jordan met us at the table after the hostess led us over.  Good to note- we arrived here right around 4:30 and walked right in.  On our way out- there was a waiting room full of people.  But- back to Jordan- she offered us 'frosty cold beers' or a specialty margarita but it was a very warm end of April day so we requested ice waters.  She provided the perfect amount of attention for us to enjoy our meals but not too much that would be considered annoying.  Our waters were delivered in a minute or 2 and we ordered the fried onion.  That came out in about 5 minutes and that's the way our entire meal went.  No reason to walk you through the whole meal.    The 'highlights' of the meal were my 16oz Cowboy cut Sirloin that was simply DELICIOUS!  My wife ordered the Filet and BBQ Chicken breast and hers was delicious as well.  Very few places earn a 5 star rating from my wife- there are 3 times more places on her 'Do not go back list' than are on her 'Go Back' list and she even said- 'We'll definitely be going back\".  Btw- neither of us was able to finish our steaks so they became Monday nights' chicken & steak salad toppings and were just as delicious.  :)  I'd also like to acknowledge the cooks in the back, the 'unsung hero's' who never hear the thanks & praise that diners bestow on the wait staff.  Thank you guys!  Our meals were PERFECT!   Thank you servers & Managers for the perfect dining experience."}
{"text":"This is THE steakhouse to go to if you want a really good steak and you really don't want to pay steakhouse prices.  I've never had a bad steak here and my wife & I have made it a point to eat here at least every other week.  Reading other reviews- I can't comment on anything other than their steak, and their steak is DELICIOUS.    The servers are always nice & friendly and try to be as accommodating as possible.  My one issue is that sometimes the entrees come out way too fast- like when we're only half way finished with the appetizer and we still have our full salads in front of us!  The server told us that it was because the kitchen basically runs the 'meal service' and when it's ready- they gotta get it out to the customers.  Our next visit we will order each item ourselves, and take our chances with how long it takes the kitchen to get it out.    Keep up the great food, TR!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. From freshly baked bread down to the succulent 20oz Ribeye (RARE). Luis was extremely attentive to the needs of his guests making sure everything was 100% without us having to even ask. He was a great host!  P.S. the bread is like small sweet pillows filled with BabyJesus hugs and kisses! Everything was amazing and I certainly encourage people to check this place out! #leDrool"}
{"text":"We drove past 4 of our favorite restaurants to try this Texas Roadhouse location. I used to go to TR all the time in Oklahoma, but never tried the Phoenix location..  We walked through the doors, and even though it was busy for a Wednesday, we were seated right away. The table was ready with silverware, just waiting. We were really impressed. The host staff really had it figured out.   Then, we met our server who had a trainee. Both were very nice, although the trainee kept dropping straws in our food and reaching across throughout the night. She was nervous, so I have no complaints over her or our server. Both were bubbly and friendly.  My favorite thing about Texas Roadhouse was always the big, fluffy rolls. These rolls were about half the size as they usually are, and they were crusty and seemed a little stale, almost microwaved. But, at least they still had the great Texas Roadhouse taste.   The problem, was were given our starters- the peanuts and the bread, and had ran out of drinks. The trainee ran over to us and told us the tea was brewing- so she couldn't refill right now. Before I could ask for something else, she was gone. I have a huge fear of choking because of a med condition, so I always have to have something to drink with my food. I understand restaurants run out of tea sometimes, I would have been fine with a water in the mean time...   The worst part? The 4 of us had all ran out of drinks and sat there for 5 minutes with no drink, before a coke and water was brought to my kids, but we were told again, the tea was out. My husband asked if we could just have a coke. She asked if there was something wrong with the tea. I was irritated, and snapped a bit at the server, and said 'Nothings wrong with it. We don't have it. I just need something.\" She was nice, but didn't seem to understand why I couldn't wait. She told me again that she was waiting for the tea to finish brewing... Another couple of minutes later, I had some warm tea brought to me.   After that, service picked up. The atmosphere was fun, very busy with lots of birthdays.   The kids ordered burgers with fries. Both were great, however, after they delivered our food- the servers just disappeared. Our ketchup bottle was completely empty, not even a drop in it! It should have been in the trash, not on our table. We waited for probably another five minutes for the trainee to return so we could ask for new ketchup.   I ordered a prime rib and asked that it be only a little pink, my husband wanted his a little redder. My husband's steak didn't even appear to be cooked. It looked like they removed it from the package and placed it on the plate. He pushed lightly, and the fingerprint stayed. The server took it back, and the manager returned a few minutes later with an apology. We were disappointed that the same steak was taken to the back and recooked and brought back to us, instead of starting over fresh. Most of the juices had been cooked away and it was now a brown color.   I expected the manager to offer us a dessert, or something for the chaotic night, but instead we were given a recooked steak. Very disappointed on that.   As for our actual service, I know those servers were working very hard, and it was a very busy night in there. I hope this store finds some more help so the servers aren't having to scurry and neglect tables.. I say this because my servers were very patient and nice, they just seemed stressed.   I love Texas Roadhouse, but I hope the rest of the staff at this location steps up to the level of the awesome host team. Those guys held it together all night, and knew exactly where their empty tables were, and filled them immediately."}
{"text":"DOMINIKKA. MVP!!!!!! Blown away with the service and food here at the roadhouse.  If you're lucky enough to meet Domonikka she will make you feel like family.  Thanks for the AMAZING service."}
{"text":"Fantastic in every way!  We used their call-ahead option and were seated within 5 minutes of arriving.  The food was excellent and everything that we hoped it would be.  Even the complimentary bread was mouth watering!  The service was outstanding - got refills on my drink quickly and without having to ask - and they gave great recommendations.  The manager introduced herself to us personally.  Everyone had smiles!  I will be coming back here for date nights with my wife, and anytime I want to celebrate a special occasion with my son (who loves steak).  HUGELY recommend this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"I have to shout out to two AWESOME individuals who wait on us each time we go. Anthony is excellent he doesn't miss a beat making sure you are taken care of and drinks are full all the time and the same goes with Courtney Joe. If you want the best service ask for these two!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service!! Beats any restaurant in Wickenburg. Short drive to Surprise. On Grand near Trader Joes.  This will be our new place to eat. I had the grilled chicken salad and hubs had one of their burgers. Large portions. We took half home. Two meals for the price of one!! Give it a try."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this steakhouse for the longest time and finally got the chance to have lunch here. The atmosphere is typical of western-style steakhouses with the expected kitsch and dim lighting. Our server was very attentive and the food came very shortly after we ordered. I started the meal with a Caesar salad, which was good. For my entree, I picked the 8-oz. sirloin and added sauteed onions and mushrooms to the order. The meat was properly cooked to medium, just as I ordered, but it was definitely lacking in flavor. It didn't have the savory grilled-meat flavor I had come to expect from establishments such as this. The onions were not sauteed enough and were just a tad away from completely raw, while the mushrooms were overcooked and dry. While I did enjoy the casual, relaxed atmosphere and fast, friendly service, hopefully a future visit will be a better experience foodwise."}
{"text":"Friendly service..but the food honestly tasted heated up from another day. Came with the family and we got full off there bread instead. The bread they bring in the beginning was very yummy and soft! But the food is not worth it, I didn't even like there fries because they have too much garlic, and I'm a person who likes garlic but felt it was too much. Not coming back unless its for the bread lol"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, leaving full! Awesome dinner for Fourth of July! Came here with the family and always enjoy eating here! Service was fast and proper, the food was fresh and was cooked to desired taste and always enjoy their dinner rolls! Would recommend getting the rib eye and the ribs! Very tasty!"}
{"text":"So far we waited just under an hour. When we were told we have a a 30 min wait.  Hostess is rude and wouldn't look at me while she talked to me.  I've never had such bad service and I didn't get food yet. Not standing around to find out."}
{"text":"We went here for my BFFs boyfriend birthday now we had a party of 20 people for different tables this place is not really good if you have more than 15 people they don't have places to mix tables together so when we ate we had to turn around not a big deal if you have someone sitting behind you that you don't like fortunately for me it was my BFF behind me. The food was good but for a steakhouse and while I realize this isn't Peter lugars Still for a franchise place come on food was good service was slow but again there was 20 plus of us so plan ahead let them I know that you will be there and how many"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of this restaurant every since I moved to the area.  It was my favorite restaurant chain for ribs, grilled salmon, French fries and roasted chicken.  However, I just visited and the quality of the food has gone down?  Their \"hot-out-of-the-oven\" fresh bread was like a big dry round biscuit.  Their \"fall off the bone ribs\" were dry and had no taste unless I drenched it with bbq sauce. Their vegetable medley used to have sort of a warm lemon butter flavor but my broccoli was gross and so overcooked, I couldn't even pick it up with a fork... it was like eating mashed potatoes?! And their salmon used to be moist and flavorful but now it's dry and overcooked, with little to no taste.  They've even stopped placing lemon slices on the salmon?  Really Texas Roadhouse, I can't get a slice of lemon for my fish?  Overall, the only thing that helped on my last visit was the side salad that came with my entrée. I like their Caesar dressing, so I found other leftovers at home (chicken, tomatoes, carrots) and threw them on top of the greens to make my meal. I would have given them one star but after speaking to the manager, he apologized and stated he'd give me a credit so that my next meal would be taken care of.  Unfortunately nothing was done for my inconvenience of having to find other food to eat that evening."}
{"text":"First visit, party of 8 - Sunday at noon. Promptly seated and the place was hopping.   No wait and kitchen was well staffed.    Server Sean, was friendly and on top of it.   They place buckets of peanuts on your table and bring you warm fresh rolls with whipped cinnamon butter.  I would have been happy with just the warm rolls and butter.     All 8 of use enjoyed what we ordered and all cooked perfect.   You get your choice of sides and there are a lot of them.  Cesar and side salads perfectly chilled and fresh.  The roadkill was my selection with grilled onions and loaded potato and salad.    Sister had salmon and she liked it better than Mastros.  Of course the portion was smaller but it came with two sides and a much smaller cost.   The others had steak and shrimp.   Presentation was nicely plated.   Great selections for all, well prepared and excellent friendly service.  Great location.  They have a nice kids menu."}
{"text":"We really enjoy the dinner rolls they serve right away.  The filet is very good and the servers are awesome. They offer a wary bird menu which is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Just ate at the Texas Road House in phoenix, AZ.  It was all good.  Had the 6 oz sirloin steak.  Was really good.  My husband had the pork chops.  He says was good.  Fast service,nice server.  (Name of Leslie).  Checked on us periodically.  Nice experience. We eat here when we come to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  Especially when they have excellent service.  Food was perfect and it came out quickly after our order was placed! Servers were extremely friendly too!"}
{"text":"This was my first and last visit to Texas Road House. We waited 50 minutes for a table which I understood since it was Saturday night. The service was good. Our server Julia was great and very attentive. The food was good. The noise level was so high that I could not speak with my dinner companion. We tried talking and couldn't hear each other, so we just ate and left. When I eat I would like some calm so that I could enjoy my food. That didn't happen."}
{"text":"Second visit even better than first. New Year's Eve was packed. We called ahead, went smooth, waited in the bar for our table and decided to just eat there. Bartender Kevin handled it for us. Food was very good, service outstanding and the employees have fun. We will be regulars here."}
{"text":"I've been to this Texas Roadhouse many times and have always been satisfied. The service is always good as is the food. For a chain restaurant this place is top notch. The only thing I have ordered here that I didn't like was dessert, but you're going for the steak anyway, so stick to that."}
{"text":"This is not a good place for a steak. Great ribs, chicken dishes and burgers. Steaks are tough, good luck getting them cooked to your liking they always come warm not hot. Waiters and waitresses are great"}
{"text":"Our waitress was anastasia. She was AMAZING! She was super friendly and was on top of everything. Calvin, my fiancé,  had a great birthday dinner thanks to her! The food was delicious too!"}
{"text":"Went here because I could not eat at Haris's Pita Grill...sad sad sad...  But! I like the food at Texas Roadhouse. I have been here many times and have ordered either their steak or salmon and have always enjoyed them very much.  I also really like the rolls! Just thinking about them makes me want to stuff my face with doughy goodness again.   The restaurant is very casual and laid back -- it can get loud at times so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you plan on having a deep conversation with someone else.  Also the place is always crowded so just be prepared to wait, especially during the weekends or around dinner time."}
{"text":"This place is a total dive and I am completely baffled as to why it's so popular, you have to wait forever to get in. The floors are littered with peanuts, classy. The food is nothing special, way less than mediocre compared to other chain restaurants. The restaurants are always crowded and very loud. I was forced to come her for my sister's birthday, too bad my family loves dive restaurants otherwise I would of never come here."}
{"text":"I love their steaks here! They have a real upbeat and friendly staff! Everyone is always smiling and they have this cool thing they do where they dance. Did I mention they have real great steaks!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food! Great service! Reasonable price for what you get. I had the pulled pork last visit. It was excellent! I think I have tried all of there sides, and I have not been disappointed with any of them. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I went there, for the first time, with a group of ladies (7 of us), and we all had separate checks, which was not an inconvenience to our waitress. The atmosphere is a fun one, the bread basket with honey-whipped cream was delicious, however, I had to stop myself from eating it all by myself, because, I started to eat more low carb. But it was really yummy! The peanuts in a bucket seating on the middle of the table was our welcome to the place, really neat! I ordered the \"Roadkill\" platter, with a cup of chili and a Caesar salad. The salad was good, and it came with an extra item, a mini MARSHMALLOW!! I don't know why? But I didn't mind at all, it was just funny! The chili was good too, and the roadkill, which was ground chuck steak with mushrooms and onions was good, the flavor of the mushrooms was really good, but the size of the onions were too big, and they were not cooked through, so it had a strong raw flavor to me. And I don't hate onions. Our waitress treated us very good, always minding our empty glasses, and was never in a hurry to turn our table.  Kudos for the wait staff!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family. The ribeye steak is the best. Very filling. My family and I enjoyed it"}
{"text":"The ribs aren't as good as Famous Dave's, but they're good.  The house salad and baked sweet potato are both good."}
{"text":"What an awesome experience!  Our waitress Destinee was so attentive and provided excellent service and went above and beyond to make sure we had a pleasant experience!  The food soo delicious! I would totally recommend this location and I will be returning!"}
{"text":"We have been to almost every TRH in the US. And this place just simply gets a 2 star rating. I walked in and gave the hostess my info, she told me to stand to the side and she will get a table for us. There must have been about 20 people behind me and she began to send people to be seated (did she completely forget me??) NO!!!! I was right in front !!!! She sat 6 tables from groups of 2/ 3/ 6. My husband came in from parking the car and asked me what was going on??? He jumped in and asked her what's the prob. We got seated immediately ?????? When we where walked to our booth I was expecting the usual greeting ( Hi!! Have you been here before). Nope that didn't happen. Our waitress was pleasant, but overwhelmed. Food was good, but hospitality could use some improvement. I don't think will be visiting this location again. The front staff NEEDS more training!!!! There attitude and arrogance don't help either."}
{"text":"My sister has classes on Tuesday nights at a dance studio nearby and I was in charge of driving her, so we stopped here to eat an hour beforehand.  At every other Texas Roadhouse I've been to, I've enjoyed myself. However, my experience at this particular location was much different.   First, the hostess was rude and hardly spoke to us. She didn't say anything as we sat down at our table, which was extremely wobbly. Also, our rolls were not brought to the table by the hostess when we were seated like they normally are. As people around us were being seated, they were immediately brought rolls and we were not. And they were NOT out of them, there were several baskets sitting up front as we walked in.   Our server, Robin, was very unexperienced. She awkwardly talked to us for a literal 4 minutes before taking our drink orders. Having previous waitressing experience, I found that this was a waste of her time and ours. She brought us our drinks and we ordered two baskets of chicken fingers, knowing that we did not have time for a steak because by that time we only had 45 minutes until my sister had dance class. Ten minutes later, Robin comes back and asks for our order... AGAIN. We explained that we had already ordered and she nervously shrugged off her mistake and assured us that our order was in the system and on it's way. We also mentioned that we needed to get out of there somewhat quickly and she assured us once more that our food would be there shortly.  FORTY MINUTES LATER, our food was still not at the table. Other guests who had been sat ten to fifteen minutes after us were munching on their steaks and ribs while we were still waiting. She came over and explained that she didn't know why our food wasn't ready and asked if we wanted our food to-go, to which I said yes. A manager brought over our food all boxed up and gave us two free appetizer cards for our next visit. She also brought over drinks in to-go cups, which I thought was a hospitable touch.  The food was hot and tasted mediocre, though my sister shoveled hers down as I sped off to the dance studio. She was late, and I was not happy eating my dinner out of a to-go box in my car.  The only reason I will be returning to this location is to use my free appetizer card."}
{"text":"This is the first one in Arizona we tried and the rib app was great, the rolls were awesome and the steaks were cooked as we ordered them. I had the smothered chicken which also was very good. My only complaint was how loud the dishes were banged when tables were being cleaned got to wondering what the breakage on them was. As on many occasion they startled us while we were in conversation. We will come back for the food for sure."}
{"text":"YOU CAN PUT YOUR NAME ON THE LIST WHILE YOU'R STILL AT HOME! So much for wait times lol. But seriously they allow you to call ahead and put your name on the list and avoid the wait, which is super convenient for people with children who cant be without paw patrol for 5 minutes!  But okay to the food!  Arrived on a packed friday night, no meat for lent my booty! this place was PACKED. Surprisingly we got seated right away. They actually have this really awesome system that lets the hostess know when a table has received their check to speed up wait times. Very cool very cool.  Bloomin' onion for the win. Ours came out perfectly fried with the horseradish sauce to compliment it. They also give you endless bread rolls with this pretty tasty cinnamon butter spread. I ordered a steak and rib combo, complete with cheese and bacon fries. it took 35 minutes to come out, and by this time i was annoyed because other tables around me who had gotten there well after me received their food before me.  Pricing wise it is your standard franchise menu, $15 for combo meals, full steaks were a little pricier but for fair market value.  Atmosphere was extremely loud, and they do this really annoying and over the top birthday thing like i literally had to cover my little ones ears. He has a sensory disorder and the restaurant should give people a heads up that this occurs otherwise it just ends with an upset toddler.  Staff was friendly and fast, the food was decent and exactly what you would expect from a franchise place."}
{"text":"The chefs didn't seem to know the difference between raw cold purple and a medium rare fillet. Once it came back the 3rd time raw, we gave up and ate sides instead. Great customer service though."}
{"text":"They should change their name to TEXAS SALT HOUSE.  Been there twice and both times we had the same experience:  Steaks were tender, but tasted like they had been marinated in salt.  Side vegetables were so salty that I was unable to eat them.  Servers were pleasant, but it seems a little silly that they stop in the middle of serving you in order to dance in the aisles.  No desire to return."}
{"text":"I have to thank my Yelp buddy, John D., for posting some pics from a recent visit to Texas Roadhouse.  It's been years since I've been to one, but I remember that crack bread very well.   I asked my husband how long it's been since he's been to a TX RH and he said, \"probably 20 years.\"  Well, let's hit it up after the movie and see if it's still good.  We knew what we wanted before we even got in there:  bone-in ribeye.  Add some caveman grunts here.    I had a small cold Bud ($4) and he had a tall cold Sam Adams ($7) and we split the ribeye, green beans, and broccoli ($24.99).  Of course we had some deliciously addictive crack fresh bread and peanuts.   The food was fantastic and you could have rolled us outta there.  The steak was grilled a perfect medium rare and those green beans with bacon are always just like grandma used to make.    The only low point was our server who was painfully slow.  Slow.  Slow.  So slow.  No sense of urgency whatsoever, but when she did show up she tried unsuccessfully to up sell us on something, so she's got that going for her.  Next time I'd probably want to sit at the bar.  Overall, the food was just as delicious as I remember and we definitely won't take so long for a return visit."}
{"text":"Good service food was decent. Busy but we called in ahead of time and got seated quickly."}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience!! Used the app to put our name in the system so had a short wait to be seated. Had fast and super friendly service. Our waitress was checking in on us to make sure everything was perfect and was fun to talk with. Our food came out on time and cooked perfectly. I ordered a 8oz sirloin med rare and it was actually med rare....how often does that happen these days lol one of the best experiences I've had at a chain steak house/restaurant in general in a long time. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I attended culinary school, and I know a good steak; not only did I choose the steak I wanted, but the chef here cooked it a perfect blue for me, very impressive for a chain restaurant. Service staff was friendly, welcoming and provided excellent service. Our visit here was my wife's first time at a Texas Roadhouse, and the peanut shells on the floor was not a pleasant surprise for her (OCD slightly), but she said the butter alone was worth tolerating the floors, from her that's an amazing compliment! Lol all in all this was the end to a great date night and I highly recommend this location to anyone who wants a perfectly cooked steak with fantastic service!"}
{"text":"We came here again for Dinner. Yes, we love it a lot! Food was fantastic as always. Fresh vegetables, really good salad, as well as great Potaoes.  But, of course the best part is the meat. Ribs this time. Oh so good~ Really cannot be beat.  We as well love the rolls and the free peanuts. But, of course you can fill up on those peanuts and not be able to eat too much of your dinner. We had great service from Kailey(think that is what it was) We bought gift cards and got along with them $5.00 off coupons as well as a certificate for a dozen free rolls to take home when we come back next time."}
{"text":"First timers here and loved it. The dinner rolls and sweet butter were so good. We had Justice as our server and she was awesome! Food and drinks were tasty. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a long time.  In the past service was just okay, but they were spot on last night.  Food was out quickly, hot and the steaks were prepared exactly as requested.  The sides of baked potato loaded were huge and okay for two to share.  The house salad was very good with hard boiled egg, cabbage, carrots, tomato and onion plus if course the lettuce.  The Caesar salad was just okay ( nothing special) made in advance,  service was outstanding this time ( cute Texas Two Step in the middle of dinner).  Lots of fun but noisy if you want to talk. As always the honey butter and rolls are to die for but get them not to brown on the outside so they aren't to chewy,"}
{"text":"Stopped in here this afternoon with my girlfriend Double Dee in an effort to please her as she demanded a steak.  Not much of a meat eater myself, I ordered tater skins and small bowl of chili while DD ordered a 6 ounce sirloin with a loaded baked potato and expressed her satisfaction with a post lunch low yet audible belch. My skins were okay, didn't care for the chili."}
{"text":"I just recently went with my family over the weekend. And I had a 16 oz steak and a caesar salad. The best Caesar salad I've ever had in my entire life to be honest their homemade dressing is amazing.  Before I went to another Texas Roadhouse and I wasn't having a great experience so I thought I'll give them one more shot and actually impressed. Everybody has different experience I know that and sometimes people write reviews on the stupid s*** just because I feel like it but I highly recommend anybody that wants to try good steak to go here all you have to do is communicate with the waiter and they will provide the food that you looking for so be realistic on comments.... And happy hours actually pretty good"}
{"text":"Had the best ribeye and best service drinks were always kept full and food came out fast definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I really enjoy dining here. I feel that they always have fast service ( I think we may have waited for a table once in all the times we have been there) they bring the delicious rolls to you as they seat you, which I find particularly nice. The servers have all been very professional and polite. My favorite thing to order here is hand down their ribs, they are super meaty  and  have such great flavor.. all of their food are in such big servings often my husband and I just share and order an extra side. Overall this is my go to place for ribs and I can always count on quick and polite service!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time and it was great. Wait was long, but I could see why. The ribs were excellent and the steak was good. The complimentary rolls went well with the food. Oh, and by the way, the employees were good and cheerful. Lindsey did a great job on everything. Hope you get her. The best thing was that the drinks were very well priced. Will be back if and when I come to Arizona"}
{"text":"Love the steaks here.  Best in town.  Service is always great on any day you go.  Always a hit with my family and friends."}
{"text":"We have been here 4 times in the last few months.  Each time the food and service are great and the prices are reasonable.  We have tried various things on the menu, appetizers, salads and steaks.  Everything has been really good.  They consistently refill drinks, clear dirty plates and are friendly and welcoming.  We will continue to visit Texas Roadhouse!"}
{"text":"2nd time coming here. They don't do reservations. You can call an hr before arriving so they can get your table ready and don't have to wait long.   I love the filet cause it's soft & moist. The potatoe skins are good especially with sour cream & so is the cactus blossom (it taste like onion rings, but in a different shape) the horseradish sauce is really good with it. *Don't get road kill cause literally that's what it feels like ur eating, it's so dry!   They give you ice cream for your birthday & if you want they do a saddle call. Wasn't sure what that was and asked it for my dad and they brought a saddle and you sit on it and yell ur name and age it was hilarious especially for older people, I think it's more for younger people, you can ask for just the ice cream if you want."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday night.  Restaurant was full.  They do have a gluten friendly menu but all the meat is without seasoning/sauce, except salt and pepper and there are very few options.  I ordered a burger without the bun and fries.  They didn't get me sick, but the burger was burnt and both it and the fries were too salty.  It was also supposed to be a bacon cheese burger but no bacon and no tomato or pickles or anything on it. My husband had the fried chicken, which he said was pretty good and my son had the ranger ribs and he said those were great.  They brought out the kids meals first (we didn't ask for that) and then it took another 20 minutes for ours, which was an extremely long time.    I will say the server was really nice and attentive and the coke zero was good.  Those were the only pluses for me.  I am only giving 3 stars because my family thought it was ok."}
{"text":"The food/drinks are fine. No problems with that side. Last night my server told me the $50 gift card I tried to use has a zero balance. After thinking about it, last month my wife and I used 2 gift cards. That server, by fault or theft, gave me the zero balance card instead of the $50 one. That sucks hard!"}
{"text":"great service great food and the type of customer service that keeps you coming back."}
{"text":"The ribeye steak was good and  the rolls with cinnamon butter was excellent  and the staff was good to us."}
{"text":"Ate there last night, had chicken fried steak, wow was so glad she left handful of cocktail napkins on table because that's where my steak went, it was so grizzly I could not chew it! Was surprised how bad it was, went to Texas and and had same dish at a Roadhouse there, it was so good! But apparently this Roadhouse does not get the same meat! Won't be ordering that ever again!    Crazy us went there for our anniversary dinner, it was prime rib night. We were early because we know how busy they get. We asked for a booth, she said how about a half booth, I thought okay, but turns out it's right In Front of bathrooms, really, I said no not tonight , as we walked all the way back there, we saw countless empty booths, when I asked she said, no servers for them, yet people were being seated in them. She finally went to front left us standing and came back with a seating in a decent booth. Okay, server came right away, unusual since she stated no server a few minutes ago. Got the prime rib and it was awful. My hubby said it looked microwaved, I had ordered it medium,it was all brown and raw inside. Tasted like leftover warmed up meat. All and all way to ruin our 48th anniversary. Guess we will try a new place, and try to salvage finding a great anniversary dinner. Thanks Roadhouse!"}
{"text":"I went here for a 'nice' steak dinner. however, i think 'nice' is actually 'bleh'.  All I wanted was a big, fat hunk of delicious meat and some healthy vegetables. Apparently they have vegetables but I wouldn't call them healthy. They have green beans, and I'm sure they are delicious with all the butter and bacon they are cooked in but I am 100% sticking to my New Years resolution. I asked instead if I could have fresh green beans cooked by themselves. My waitress said NO.  NO?! you mean you don't have fresh vegetables?  Everything they have is already premade and nothing is fresh. GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The steak was bland and I pretty much used an entire mound of salt for flavor. It ended up being like $20 bucks after tip. Totally ridiculous.   I don't understand restaurants that don't use fresh vegetables and nothing can be cooked to order. that totally grosses me out. I will not be back. If I was by myself I would have left when I found out nothing was fresh, but I was with people and didn't want to insult them because one of them chose this place?"}
{"text":"If I had to add a star I only do so as requested. Im very disappointed! What happened? We got seated straight away to a dirty table w peanut shells drinks dishes etc look over to right say bus boy yapping w lady waitress\" hey clean off table!\" After that we ordered Our fav Rattlesnake cheese curds what we call them Michigan they use to be hot melted cheddar cheese balls that had spicy kick these were ice cold frozen ugh a turnoff I had lunch chicken fried steak grizzle fat fried in greasy crust  that was gross! My friends lunch size steak was a kiddie portion not lunch sized She asked if she could get fried onions or mushrooms on it? We never got answer. And Skimp on those delicious rolls only six in basket? In past got more than 6. Only thing good was buttered corn &mash potatoes and ice tea sweetened. But We don't think we will be back it went down hill! Sorry but true!"}
{"text":"Got thee worst disrespectful racial unprofessional experience from the manager Jill! After being told I would wait 5-10 minutes,  30 minutes later I got seated,  and excited about my steak I had been wanting.  To get my plate messed up and a rude manager! Not only did she argue with me about the doneness of my steak in which I sent back,  and it came back again under cooked,  she went as far as to have my fiance open his carryout and claim it was part of his steak... That she has no idea where I got this meat,  that she brought me, Management here is a joke!!! Never will I go back to this location!"}
{"text":"I've given this place too many chances.   The only thing good about this place is the servers.  My food is either over or under cooked.  I ordered a medium steak I didn't say put it on the grill and forget about it.    Only good part is your food is always free because you have to send it back four times!  I wish I could give it less than one star."}
{"text":"I have been to a Roadhouse before, in Texas. This one served me a sirloin steak that was to fatty. I was chewing for what felt like 10 minutes before the steak was broke down enough to eat. It spoil the mood and meal.  The location is surrounded by steakhouses.  The atmosphere was pretty festive. The servers began to dance for a little girls birthday party.  The service was good.  The price was pretty standard but I would want to come during their happy hour."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 2.5 but since I can't I'm going to give it a 2.  I was not impressed with this place although I should have been.  The place was lively and comfortable.  Peanut shells on the floor and a Jack-elope bust on the wall always make me feel at home.  The waitress was great but this is where this review takes a turn for the worst.  I ordered the full rack of ribs and my wife got the steak.  The appetizer salads they brought out were so filled with cheese and very buttery croutons that there was less veg than toppers.  The big problem were the ribs for me.  They were dry, and I mean bone dry which is no good.  My wife's steak was huge and done well so no complaints.  We finished it off with apple pie that had a strange carmel topping on the side that spread like warm taffy... not impressed.  Not the worst but I have definitely seen better.  Price isn't too bad for a \"steak house,\" but Ill take my business elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"I've been here prior for dinner and given it a 5 Star every time.  The service has always been great!  The food outstanding!  The atmosphere Awesome!  This is why, when I drove into town I immediately wanted to take my Girlfriend to lunch there for her Birthday!  She loves this place and we have religiously always seen the employees make the birthday person feel super special.  However, maybe birthdays are only celebrated at night?  Which ever the reason, on her special day at her favorite place we left with the question, \"Why didn't they do their birthday dance thingy?\".  I have no complaints about the food and we have always visited for dinner.  However, we were bringing an elderly family member that doesn't get out much to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday at her favorite spot.  We figured it would be great to do a lunch!  The food was great and as soon as we got seated I let the waitress know it was her birthday.  We even had two waitresses asking if everything was okay.  However, the only thing the waitress remembered was to bring us the bill.    Driving 6 hours and going there the moment I got into town, to make her birthday special.  Was just a huge let down.  I've seen how cool they are prior on peoples birthday's.  Definitely not going here for birthdays, and if we do, not expecting anything."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Texas Roadhouses, and they're pretty consistent. Good food (not incredible, but on par, or maybe a little better than the competitors - Outback, Black Angus, etc). I like Prime Rib, and rarely get one cooked properly at this class of place. It was good, but a bit lifeless. The others' meals were good. We had a little trouble getting much service from our waiter - looked mike maybe it was not a regular issue. I did get a bit frustrated when we're trying to get the waiter's attention and they go into their dance.    I'd go back, but I'm in a great hurry."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much my go-to for BBQ ribs. Their ribs are always tender and flavorful; I've yet to be disappointed. The bread and butter can definitely fill you up if you don't remind yourself that you ordered a full meal. My fiancee likes the chicken smothered in portobello mushroom sauce; the sauce can seem like a lot but it's actually proportion to the amount of meat. She doesn't usually order chicken at restaurants but this is always tender when she has it.   For a while now, they've had a Yelp deal when you check-in: free cactus blossom. Two of our servers weren't aware of the deal, so make sure someone asks the manager."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!  They say everything is bigger in Texas... just not the portions at Texas Roadhouse. Eat a snack before you go. The food is good just be ready for toddler portions."}
{"text":"Omg the Rattlesnake bites are yum.. had an awesome time and they made my daughter feel special on her bday."}
{"text":"This place is a joke anymore and they will never see me again. I'd say out of the last 5 visits here the steaks were overcooked 4 times including tonight. We ordered 1 sirloin & ribs, 2 forth worth ribeyes which they overcooked both   and 1 salmon. My sirloin even though it was medium rare tasted dry. The salmon was prepared accordingly and tasted good.  The ribeyes were supposed to be medium and came out well. So upon 2 of us eating while the other 2 waited the replacement steaks finally came out after about 10 minutes. They were juicy pink this time but the amount of fat was ridiculous. (Picture included) Obviously I was very unhappy with everything and the manager Ron initially said he'd take care of the meals. The bill came out full price and Ron basically told us oh well. That was until I intensified my voice and he took care of 1 meal. The waitress was sweet as pie and told us we were correct in what we did. It was also stated by another table that they work at Longhorne and there would never be a question upon our complaints and both meals comped because it's good business. In addition, the loaded mushrooms were doused in salt."}
{"text":"Ive decided to give this place another try.  Received feedback from the owner and a complementary meal.  I took my time coming back, beause i was so unhappy with the previous service and food.  I must say, this time was AWESOME!!! My server was Kris, she was very attentive, polite and just great.  The food wasnt like licking a salt lick like my last experience. It was MLK day, so you opended later in the day.  There was a line, but it moved very fast and we were seated quickly.  Overall, it was a way better experience and i WILL be back.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff and delicious food. I usually get a steak with fries and a salad with Thousand Island dressing. it is always cooked perfectly and delicious."}
{"text":"My parents had just finished helping my girlfriend and I move into our new apartment and I wanted them to eat at a place we'd been to before instead of trying a \"hole in the wall\" place that might suck  We'd been to the location in Wisconsin and thought it was a lot of food and would be fun and different....it is.  1) The bread you get when you sit down is the best tasting bread ever 2) The country fried chicken/steak is a honkin' large slab of meat you won't finish (prolly cuz you just ate a bunch of rolls) 3) It comes with amazing chili and great cheesy fries 4) The beer on tap tasted good   Peanuts on the floor everywhere, great/fun waitresses, fun atmosphere, a ton of food for the price, etc...what's not to like here?  Bottom line....go there...it may not be the mom and pop tiny location where you feel like you're park of a small town hidden gem...but with this type of variety and environment who cares?  4 people, 2 bbq pulled pork sandwiches, 2 country fried steaks, 2 salads, 2 bowls of chili, 2 tall glasses of beer, 1 big frozen Margarita, $63"}
{"text":"In town on business and this was best choice nearby.  Wednesday night. Seated at bar. Semi-crowded and typical ambience (good music, sports on tv's and noisy...which I enjoy).  One bartender who's ok. Not too attentive, but available when you need something.   I ordered NY Strip (Med rare) with baked potato and green beans. Steak was a great cut but it was overcooked - more like medium. I was disappointed b/c it looked to be a nice, thick cut. I considered keeping it but it's expensive and asked for a do over. She took it away (along with potato and left green beans) and said she'd bring another in a few minutes.   The new steak (and potato) came about 10 mins later (great!) and it definitely wasn't as nice a cut. It was much thinner and almost looked like a sirloin  but can't be sure if it was or not. It was cooked properly and tasted ok. Potato was dry though and now green beans are cold.   The manager never asked if my second steak was cooked right and I wasn't offered a discount on it. I expected at least an apology from someone for the inconvenience. I did get the tab and was charged for one beer instead of two. Not sure if that was a mistake or a freebie for the issue but if I had to guess it was a mistake.   Overall, it's kind of what I expect from Texas Roadhouse in any city. I really want to love the food here BC everything else is usually so great, but most times I'm a little disappointed in the food given the prices they charge.   I will come back to TR for sure but maybe not this locale. The food lacked as did the service here."}
{"text":"With my out-of-town guests and family members, we had a grand time at the Texas Roadhouse in Arrowhead center. Our server Kylie was fantastic, ensuring we had everything we needed. She was patient with our numerous questions and special requests. The food, which included six varities of dishes, was exactly as described on the menu, and most importantly, was very delicious. We'll be back. Sincerely, Karen & Art Huseonica"}
{"text":"Went here last night and food was good as usual BUT there is no excuse for the sorry service we received last night! At first the service was great as soon as we put in our order it went downhill from there. A party was sitting behind us and they had no problem getting prompt service from 5 waitresses but we could not get refills on drinks and purposely got ignored. When she would come to our table she was on the rude side. At one point our waitress decided to sit down at a corner table and have full conservations with wait staff, while we were waiting on her to bring our check and to go boxes. It took us over 30 minutes to get to go boxes,get the check and for her to bring back out debit card!   We won't come back to this location!"}
{"text":"Ah big corporate chains. You are \"hit and miss\" depending on the management, staff, stock etc. This location (or more likely, this visit) was more of a miss. There was another steakhouse right next door that we almost went to, but for some reason, I just wanted a comfortable steak...nothing too upscale. So we chose the Roadhouse.   We were told there was a wait, so we went into the waiting area to munch on the famous peanuts. There were no seats available EXCEPT right next to some floor mats that they rolled up and placed on the bench. So we sat in the empty spots next to them. I suddenly knew why they were empty because there was an overwhelming stench of mildew coming from the mats. It was a great way to kickstart our appetite.   The staff was great. Our server was very nice and did a great job. My medium rare ribeye came out and I cut a piece and took a bite. It was very chewy and I looked and saw that the steak was a bit purple inside almost like liver. It was too rare. They took it and brought it back. Still purple. They took and brought it back again. Although not perfect, I just said it's fine and ate it. It was a terrible cut of steak because it was mostly fat with small areas of meat hanging off. If I was the cook or manager, I probably wouldn't have served that cut.   Overall, the experience is usually good at Texas Roadhouse, but this one visit was not very good at all. But I'll probably still go back in the future!"}
{"text":"I have had at least 50 steaks here since they opened, everyone of them perfect. the salad served with the dinner is amazing. the baked potatoes are large and cocked to perfection. definitely the best value to quality of any steakhouse I have been to. my girlfriend is always very satisfied with her meals as well."}
{"text":"I was staying right next door at the Hampton and I just wanted to grab a quick bite to eat. I have never been to a Texas Roadhouse but I liked it here. All of the servers were super friendly and nice and did a great job with the service. I got the grilled chicken with onions and mushrooms, a potato, and the veggies. The chicken and potato were good but the veggies were a little more raw than I like and had a lot of butter on them. I am trying to eat healthy people! The chicken could have used a little more flavor as well but it wasn't awful. I would come back again, especially since it is about 50 feet from my hotel room."}
{"text":"The food was good the price was right the staff was GREAT! Maddie our server was wonderful! She was knowledgeable professional and friendly. We would come back just for the great service."}
{"text":"Again, wish you could rate for and server separately. Food was ok. I had the ribeye (med rare) and loaded mash potatoes. Service was great (Danny was server). He was great. Checked on all his tables. Suggested non menu items. Cleaned tabled--mean really cleaned--like he was getting ready for surgery--went not checking tables. Looked like he was running bar items when he could. Great guy."}
{"text":"The family went here for dinner tonight.  Now this was the worst food experience we have had with a Texas Roadhouse by far.  The ribs were tough and not fall off the bone.  The shredded pork was dry,  The sides were  cold and the catfish really was not good.  My father in law had a piece of a plastic bag in his ribs.....wow.  The manager offered up new ribs, but did not take it off the bill until we had to question why it was not removed.  The server though was awesome.  His name was Michael.  He was on point in a busy place and joked right along with us.  The women in our party swooned over him also which made him blush when I told him that.  Texas Roadhouse is not my first choice in restaurant.  The overall handling of the plastic in the ribs was not handled properly by the manager.  The food was not the best tonight, but the server himself was good."}
{"text":"The waitress was nice but extremely slow.  15 mins to get a refill after the waitress was at our table and said she would be right back with them.  This happened not once but twice on our visit.   When they finally brought some food to us they dropped a ranch dressing cup on me.  It took them 10 mins to come back with water and napkins.  On top of it all their was not a discount or anything on the check.    It was dirty in the restaurant.  Layer of dust on the lights.    Never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Our family of 4 ate here for dinner and we eat here quite often but tonight was exceptionally  awesome! We got seated fairly quickly,  and our waitress Sarah Jo was Great and very accommodating. My steak was cooked perfectly through-out! My husbands pork chops were delicious and like always we had plenty of leftovers for our furry friends at home! :) So thank you Texas Road House, for making this a good family dinner experience!"}
{"text":"Just dined in today and I had such a great experience. Someone gave me a coupon for blossom app, so I decided to visit this place one more time. Different from most of the nights during the week, we got seated briefly within 10mins. Morgan was our server, and I have to give credit to her by her dedication to customers and a sweet personality.   The cactus blossom is fried onion dipped in flavored ingredients and it tasted very crunchy and delicious. However with the amount of food we were getting, we couldn't have enough room to finish this plate.  Steak are good as usual and bread was brought out without having to ask. I will revisit this place very soon."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times, and the bread is a must that keep me coming back here. There is no complaint about the food, but the service was kinda here and there. First time I was there, I got a really crappy service, but I gave them another chance and I was not disappointed.   Loved the steak, however the green beans as add-on wasn't meet my expectation. It was soggy and opened from a can I think."}
{"text":"First time last night to eat here. We decided to do take out so I put the order in on line for pick up at 6. I was there early and waited with everyone else. The waitress was on the ball and very pleasant! My order was ready at 6 and was correct. The food was ok. It wasn't anything spectacular but wasn't bad. It was warm but figured that was due to taking it home. I ordered a cheese cake for dessert and it was frozen in the middle, which wasn't bad but not fun. Guess next time I will eat there but will do an early dinner since the place was packed and the parking lot was full!! All in all, the food was good enough to try this place again"}
{"text":"Love the ribeye steak and caesar salad. Their crutons, free bread, and cinnamon butter are my favorite. However, not a fan of the messy peanut shells on the floor. Great atmosphere. Also fun to watch a game at the bar."}
{"text":"I brought my family here following a baby dedication. Prior to arriving - I had my father called for Call Ahead Seating. He explained we'd have 3 small children and asked how long the wait would be - the young lady could not confirm but not long.  Upon arrival- I went in and asked before we unloaded small children and seniors and were told a table was being checked on. Once everyone was in we were informed it would be 45 minutes to an hour.  Never again- sorry. You lost A party of 8 today and going forward for disrespect. On another note - kudos to you for having a Wounded Warrior  parking."}
{"text":"After reading previous reviews we almost didn't dine here.  I am so glad we did.  Our server was Shana and she is awesome.  The Road Kill was delicious as was my rib eye steak.  The baked potato was the best I ever had.  The music wasn't too loud,  and the place had a nice cowboy vibe.  We will be back."}
{"text":"First time at the Happy Valley Roadhouse location for us.....great food/great service. We were seated in about 10 min. Recommend the Fried Pickles as an appetizer. Steak and Shrimp combo was excellent with Green beans as a side. Our server was Ashley.....she was absolutely fast and friendly. Kudos to the manager....great job selecting professional and friendly staff members. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place offers great food, atmosphere, staff and prices are very reasonable for the quality of steak along with other items on the menu.   Recommend the baby back ribs, always on point.  The prime rib is a hit and miss at times. Last time mine consisted of mostly just fat.  Not happy however steaks are always great!  Drinks look great too, definitely would like to do a quick happy hour when possible."}
{"text":"Had a long wait out side with a lot of tables open then server was going to take us to our table then took anther group   food was ok i have had better for that price i understand you can throw peanut oin the floor but with that being said there floor was still very dirty with other stuff"}
{"text":"Service is really slow had to get up and get my own water the food is really really good that's why they got three stars I understand you're supposed to have peanuts on the floor but I didn't think you were supposed to have trash and old food and other stuff restaurants really dirty I really like eating here cuz the food is really good if you don't mind crappy service then go ahead and eat here cuz the food is really good expect a long wait time just to sit down try calling ahead see if that works"}
{"text":"While the food here is good. We are up to 24 calls to try and talk to someone or place a Togo order. We have been hung up on 4 times and the phone is constantly ringing busy. They tell you to order on the website, however it doesn't let you customize like they do in the restaurant. Completely impersonal able and rude! Don't bother they don't want any business.  After my 25 call I finally spoke to a manager who took our Togo order and said she would comp our meal. It should never take 25 calls to get through. I paid full price since the Togo girls hadn't been talked to about our ordering experience. We have been back and haven't had nearly as much trouble."}
{"text":"Food was decent - service was horrendous. Multiple mistakes on food order. My 2 year old daughters hotdog was delivered 10 minutes after the rest of our food. I ordered steak and shrimp - came out no shrimp. From her reaction I could tell she made a mistake, she then came back said they dropped the shrimp on the ground in the kitchen and that's why I didn't get them. Finally received after I was done with my meal. Took 22+ minutes to get my check after we were done. I know this because my 2 and 4 year old who had been very good the whole meal were starting to lose patience and I was constantly checking my phone. She said the computer wasn't allowing her to access my check. Finally the manager came to help her at the POS at about minute 20. We were 5 feet away - manager did not stop by to apologize. Looked right at me and turned around and walked away.  Been going to various Roadhouse for years....going to have to think twice about returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, perfect steaks, good salad & rolls, ice cold beer, everything good or better.  We picked our own music from the free jukebox near the door.  Only negative would be that it's loud because it's busy.  We're going to try the early dinner next time for an even better value and, hopefully, a little less croud."}
{"text":"12/28/16 I placed a to go order.  Once I got home I realize I didn't have all of it.  After eating what I did receive I also had food poisoning until 2 a.m.  I don't think I'll be eating there again ever."}
{"text":"My recent experience with Texas Roadhouse was not good to say the least. I ordered a bacon burger without cheese. It came out with cheese on. The server apologized and within two minutes brought it back. It was obvious that the cheese was just scraped off. You could still see scraps of cheese. Therefore, I sent it back again. After almost 30 minutes of waiting for a new burger, the manager brings it out. The manager was not friendly. She did not apologize for the mistake. She did not ask how everyone else's dinner was. She set the burger down and said bacon burger no cheese and walked away. At this point my family was done eating and now had to watch me eat. The server came over and asked if the burger was good and told me her manager was taking it off the bill. The server brings us our bill and I notice the burger is still on the bill. So I mention it to the server. She says, \"sorry I guess my manager decided to not take it off.\" At this point I'm pissed. I have no problem paying for my burger. But you should not tell me that it is being taken off the check if it actually isn't. And if I have to wait 30 minutes for a meal that you screwed up , it should have been taken off the bill. I sent a email to this restaurant about my experience and was told that they would be contacting me. I have yet to hear from them."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic and our waiter Derek was just as wonderful as well. Probably one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a long time. I have never had a waiter/waitress go above and beyond like Derek did to make you feel special. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Meh is the theme of this review.  Just OK.  The steak was OK.  The frozen drink I had was OK.  The inside didn't seem that clean.  The wait staff was OK.  Decent food but nothing screams \"I want to go back to Texas Roadhouse\".  Meh."}
{"text":"Went their last night and ordered the chicken and steak dinner it was a good size chicken and a nice cut if meat for $17.00 I go their for the sweet tea it is real southern sweet tea so goooood but if you go on a Friday or Saturday make sure you call ahead"}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse gets 5 stars all because the 2 bartenders DJ and Anton! They were amazing! Friendly, attentive, and hardworking. They made our dining and drinking experience pleasurable."}
{"text":"Love Texas Roadhouse! Obviously the rolls and butter are amazing but the service is great too!"}
{"text":"It's rare that our dining experience is above expectations.  Today was one of those awesome experiences.  The wait was shorter than we were quoted.  We had, arguably, one of the best waitresses we've ever had.  It is Mother's Day, extremely busy, and Tania was so attentive!  She refilled our drinks when they were half full, replenished our bread without being asked and yet she was not invasive.  What a refreshing experience!!  To top it off, the food was amazing!!!  The steaks were perfectly cooked and full of flavor!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I avoid chain restaurants all the time but decided we would try Texas Roadhouse, now I wish we wouldn't have wasted our time or money.  The food was terrible which is unfortunate because the waitress was really good, the most attentive waitress I've had in a while."}
{"text":"First time here today at around 4 pm. Great specials and great service.  Got the chicken fried with white gravy and mashed potatoes. Awesome!  Great sweet tea and great cheese fries. The chili is fantastic!!! Ask for Hayley for great service!  Fast and delicious."}
{"text":"Yeah, meh. MEH! The steaks are par for this course! Outback, Black Angus quality. Sides are ok as well. The rolls however shine! Shine on you crazy rolls, shine on!!! They are sooooo good. You can watch them make them while you wait for your table! And wait you will!!! Even if you call ahead you will wait!!! The other plus is you can throw your peanut shells on the floor. . . just like a regular saw-dust on the floor whore house! The reason this place gets the 2 stars and not 3 or the elusive 3.5 is the salad! Twice, that's right I said it, TWICE now I've gotten a salad with bad lettuce. Gross lettuce. Lettuce past the prime of it's life! Not knowing or caring that the best days are behind him now. Just clinging to the chance to be someone's salad.  What I'm trying to say is that the lettuce on my salad was bad. Both times the server said \"We've been getting bad lettuce lately.\" It must happen often because they have a whole little spiel about it. 2nd time I asked for the manager and some 'ol boy named Garrett (He looked like a Garrett too!) saddled up and gave me the Manager's Special of the same story I just heard!!!! People. . . How hard is it to find good lettuce?!?!?"}
{"text":"Amazing! The rolls where rally tasty and the steaks where we'll prepaired; 10/10 would love this place!!"}
{"text":"I think they have some of the best Ribs I have ever ate...  Also it is a fun place to have dinner dates."}
{"text":"The pull pork was really good. The ribs were above average. The steaks were terrible, ordered medium rare but received a medium that was too salty. However, the service was good and the manager / red shirt guy offered to provide a new steak and when I decline the offer, he gave a significant discount on the bill instead. Received really good service."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place! Food is always great! I have never had a bad steak, and the service is always fast...sometimes too fast...lol. Meaning my food comes out before I am done with my salad."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  The fresh baked rolls and cinnamon butter alone make it a worthwhile trip.  Prices are low and the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Chains have a reputation for being unreliable. This chain, I find, is the exception rather than the rule. Every one that I have been to the staff has always been great. Always leave with a smile on my face or in stitches. Comfort food at its best"}
{"text":"Not the best steak but not the worst. I feel like I want to give this place another try, but then again I don't. I didn't take pics of my food because it took so long to get, I was starving. The salad was good, that is literally the only note worthy part of the night."}
{"text":"It's a chain and all Texas Roadhouses taste the same, which is a good thing. Overall a good experience. Food came out quick and the staff was friendly. The bread and butter is the best part and they can good pork chops well. Only reason wasn't 5 stars because the bathrooms were awful and only one stall had to toilet paper. $-$$"}
{"text":"I can't believe I would ever put a one star on Yelp, but I had no choice here. The food was fine (the combo app was a bit skimpy and nothing like the picture), but the service really lacked. By this, I am talking from someone who has worked in all areas of the food service industry.   After ordering, my server came back to tell me the roasted chicken was sold out (understandable - those take a long time to make), so I ordered something different. My husband's food came 10 minutes later; mine: 25 minutes AFTER his. Now, if I was the server, I would have communicated better with the kitchen regarding this; I would have tried to find a way to compensate us (free drink, app...etc). Basically-little to no empathy or attempt to reconcile this issue was (visably) made.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Great service. Quality food done well. Even the unsweetened iced tea was very good. Everything was obviously fresh and the attention to detail is certainly there. Family loved the bread too.  If you ever find anything wrong or not to your liking they have no problem making it right so speak up.  It is very noisy, but that is desirable with many people in appropriate circumstances. The atmosphere is anything but subdued."}
{"text":"Service is great. Came in on a busy Saturday night and called ahead to be put on the wait list. Once we got there we waited an extra few minutes before we got the text saying our table was ready. We had a party of four and all the food and drinks came out good, except mines. I felt like my ribeye was a little bit too fatty. Our server Kellie took care of us and got the manager, Collin. He was happy to take care of everything. Besides that everything was good. Biscuits and butter was the bomb and I think they had the best ceasar salad I ever had lol.."}
{"text":"Last night we decided to eat at Texas Roadhouse.  Mind you the restaurant is a little out of the way, we live in Medina and this place is in Stow.  We were seated right away (we got there at the right time).  And our Server Daniel came and took our Drink order right away.  The servers treated the customers like friends. I like that.  Anyway after ordering 2 appetizers plus the 5 Drinks they came back soon.  He took our order (due to Allergies I have to order mine specific)  He wrote it correct but mine came back wrong.  But the situation was corrected real quick.  And I mean way beyond what was needed.  Only problems I have is the distance.  We need one of these places in Medina.  So to Daniel and The Crew, my family thanks you."}
{"text":"At six o'clock, we called to be put on the wait list to be seated by 7. We were told that that was fine but once we showed up, we were told that we had to wait 30-45 minutes for a table. They should have told us that they were unable to do that since we drove pretty far..."}
{"text":"Wow. We came here because it's usually a guaranteed decent food, full tummy, and good service. That sure as heck backfired and I never heard the end of it.   We are seated quickly, and started out ok. Stingy on the butter. Ordered food and  waited. And waited. Iced teas were super watery... Which is sad because normally their tea is great. It makes me prediabetic, but it's delicious. They ran out of rolls....Which I'm sorry is like red lobster running out of cheddar bay biscuits. At that point you should closer your doors or offer a discount.   food was  suuuuuuper slow. The order before us I think went back and forth several times with errors our changes our missing items. Yay.  My fillet medallions were cold. Not lukewarm, cold. Rice was not the same as usual either, lacking somehow. Was almost done eating by the time my sweet potato finally arrived, which at least that was hot.   Everyone else was on the same boat. The kids steak bites were mostly that middle piece out of the steak you leave in because if you cut around it you will destroy the steak, but you really don't want it in there because it's unpleasant to chew into. Yeah so must of her steak bites were just stringy tendon y inedibles. Yum.   Overall it was not a great experience. We did get a five dollar discount for my potato, which is better than nothing. I am sure it was just a bad day, but come on. I'm as loyalty member...I'm.a patron.you can do better."}
{"text":"So I will start this out by saying my husband and I just had a baby 5 weeks ago.. So we decided we needed a date night! So we got grandma to baby sit and decided to go to Texas Roadhouse!   When we got there we were terrified there were a TON of people, we waited for 5 minutes if that after being told 20-25 minute wait. We sat down and had an amazing server! & it was his birthday! (Saturday 2-20) our food was amazing! The rolls were beautiful. My husband enjoyed eating just the butter.    You rock!"}
{"text":"Tonight we decided to try Texas Roadhouse. and glad we did.  The food here is always top notch.  But tonight we had EXCELLENT service as well.  Her name was Sarah.  We hope management sees this and is aware of the great employee they have.  Will be back and hope Sarah is our waitress"}
{"text":"It was a very busy Valentine's Day and the restaurant was humming! I was flying solo, so I grabbed a seat at the bar. Another gal was sitting next to me while she waited for her to-go order. The bartender was great and took my food & beverage order. It didn't take to long for my order to arrive, considering how busy they were. The gal next to me got her order and left.  My luck changed. An elderly man sat down next to me which was fine except he took his sweaty hat off and placed it next to my plates of food on the bar. I asked him if he wouldn't mind removing it from the counter and he replied \"I come in here every week and no one has ever asked me that. That's an unreasonable request and NO! I'm not going to remove it\". Appetite ruined.  Okay, well, I got my order to-go and left. So if you don't want to sit next to a rude old buck, wait for a table!!!! See my photo. : (  I mentioned this to the manager on my way out and they replied that they could not ask the customer to remove his hat from the counter where people were eating. Lost my appetite and will try Outback Steakhouse next door next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Lost quality and service.  New management team I notice.  Before, I used to remark to wife about how efficient they were with a long standing General Manager overseeing everything.  No longer...  They have gone downhill fast.  Ordered a salad, sirloin (medium well) & baked potato.  4 bites into my salad, food arrives.  I asked if they could hold food until at least 60% of salad was eaten.  They did, & came back with the sirloin that was RARE, if even that.  I sent it back for a medium well & girl manager asked if I wanted to hold onto the baked potato? I said I wanted all my food together.  She(used to be the bartender) brought back the sirloin & at best it was cooked medium.  I told her it was too red & she instead gave me a lesson on steak preparedness instead of going the extra step to please the customer.  I toughed my way thru about half & then gave up.  It was tough, full of gristle & spongy to chew.  I brought the remainder home for my dog & even felt bad for my dog although his stomach muscles could handle better than mine.  Wow!  How fast the quality, service and customer service disappeared.  It was an awful meal and awful experience.  This was at 5 pm on 4/9/16."}
{"text":"Just moved to Avon Lake 2 weeks ago and wanted to find a steakhouse nearby. We tried Texas Roadhouse last minute on a Saturday night hoping it wouldn't be a long wait (with our 18 month old lol). We were told it would be a 15 minute wait....more like about 3 minutes and our buzzer went off!! We sat and had Lisa for a server...she was fantastic!! Knew her stuff and was all over refills and checking on us. Our 18 month old didn't like the green beans and she happily got her applesauce instead with no problem and quickly! Great service especially when we expected a long wait. We will definitely return and hope to get Lisa again!!"}
{"text":"We have been here at least half a dozen times, and every time they have failed miserably. Why is it so hard to cook a steak to \"medium\" temperature? The last 3 visits we have had to send our bone in ribeyes back at least twice because they come out well. I wanted to pay 25.99 for a piece of shoe leather, I would stay home. Not to mention the 3 potatoes they have sent out each visit for each mistake. You would think the back of the house manager would be a little more concerned about food cost. If the front of the house manager Kelsey was a little more concerned about food quality and her guests instead of a conversation about her ex boyfriend at the bar with a friend of hers, maybe she wouldn't have fumbled the last chance of trying to save the my business and make up for the last of experience that her kitchen manager supplies. I'm sure that the line cooks only make 8.50 per hour at best, so corporate should probably take care of their employees a little better to try and keep their guests coming back. Their bone in rib eye is great, when it's cooked right. But it takes 3 or 4 wasted steaks to get that quality to their guests. At least some waitress got fed tonight if it wasn't for the food cost aspect. The ONLY positive aspects was Brittney P. Who is a fantastic server and apologetic for her lack of teamwork. She was super friendly and was on top of our beverage refills while we waited 2 hours for our meal to be edible. 5 stars for Brittney, however I wish yelp didn't make me choose 1 star for Texas Roadhouse, because they are unworthy. Next time I want a quality piece of meat, I will go to Delallos. I'm done with this overrated chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Every girl deserves sweet potatoes so good they make you wanna slap your momma.. The bbq chicken fell off the bone and the rest is history.. Good eats for a fair price"}
{"text":"I love the tx rdhouse we have been eating at this location for years. We live in the foothills and even drive to pick up carry out its fantastic. I love all their food I have had there. My bf and I get a tx sized combo each time we go the steak, chicken, ribs and pulled pork are great. I didn't like the pulled pork one time years ago I remember. A couple times my steak was over cooked but it was still really good so I can't really complain about that I'm not that picky but I enjoy the seasoning. I love the chili, and steak fries the most. I never do salads out here they don't do French in WV they have an excellent French non creamy dressing if they did have it here I'd get the salads. The rolls are really great I can't stand the ppl that throw the nuts on the floor enough said."}
{"text":"A Saturday night with a few friends. We had to wait  20 minutes in the Phoenix sun. Service was impeccable. I loved the rattlesnake eggs and my steak was cooked perfect. Everyone had something different and there were no complaints on the quality of the food or taste. There were pork chops, chopped steak thing, prime rib, filet and a NY strip delivered to our table. I have one regret. I am not a fan of their flavored lemonades. I tried the peach and strawberry and they both have a very odd and off-putting aftertaste (IMHO). I will stick to Iced Tea when I return."}
{"text":"Food is ok, nothing special.   Service is a FU*King joke. While these clown dance around for some sort of entertainment a customers food sits, drinks don't get refilled, no utensils, no condiments on the table. Completely pathetic. I'm here to eat not to watch some morons attempt to dance and waste my time on this crap."}
{"text":"Not bad for a chain. I like that they have the peanuts. :)  For the celiacs... they have a gluten free menu!  I did not get glutened when ordering off that menu.  The steaks... PERFECTLY cooked.  It couldn't have been done better, and that's rare these days."}
{"text":"A good place - I should come here again sometime soon.  The food was deliciously well done, and the service wasn't too long and was friendly.   The only thing is that it is really loud - I would recommend toning down the rather obnoxious music - and it's a tad too dark for my liking.  Other than that I can say that the food is scrumptious and the service was well delivered."}
{"text":"Tried the place several times but everything we ordered was always too salty.  Sad, liked the theme."}
{"text":"I really don't see why people wait for a table at this typical chain style restaurant.  It is loud with peanut shells all over the floor and serves  average to below par food.  The waitstaff seemed overly programmed and are more into turning the tables then getting to know the patrons. Honestly folks there are much better places to eat in Matthews that are locally owned and actually care about your business."}
{"text":"Experienced extremely poor customer service yesterday at lunch time.  Upon entering the restaurant, I was not greeted by the staff...but that is alright.  As I patiently stood by the counter, the staff completely ignored me...acting like I wasn't even there.  A few minutes later, a couple walked in, they were greeted and immediately seated.  I don't know if it was because I was a solo diner or what...but they continued to ignore me.  I'm not sure if this was poor management, rude employees, or just a simple oversight.  Keep this in mind before visiting this restaurant at this location."}
{"text":"One time I threw up in my mouth and thought that was the most disgusting taste I ever had, but then I ate at Texas Roadhouse and I can now stand corrected. Thanks goodness we had a gift card to this place, otherwise I would've paid in toilet paper. The atmosphere is pretty baller. I like the HDTVs and the woody feeling that the place has got going on. Oh, and the service is 5 stars. I've never had so many people say hi to me - I felt as popular as my facebook page. And my water was always filled, so I do appreciate that. But when it comes down to the nitty gritty, the food tasted like boo boo. I had the portabello chicken and I ate half of it. It just tasted like I was swallowing fat and grease. The cesear salad side was pretty tasty, but you aren't coming here for a salad. My girlfriend had the sirloin steak, and that was mediocre at best. I didnt think there was enough taste to the meat. I just thought our food was bland. Only go here if you have a colonoscopy scheduled the next morning - I guarantee you'll be clean to go by morning time."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for dinner now.  The best thing is being able to call ahead to be put on the wait list, by the time you drive there you can get seated almost right away, while others sit and wait.  Excellent food, good service, great pricing for what you get ;)"}
{"text":"Kim always takes such good care of us. We always ask for her section specifically b/c she's quick on the drawn attentive and SUPER PERKY!"}
{"text":"My wife loves the bread here! Steaks done to perfection. Drinks are delicious. Its always quite busy here. You are able to call in 45 min ahead of time to hold your place. They dont do reservations. We will be returning here as well."}
{"text":"Free hot fresh rolls were delicious. It went downhill from there. Our server wasn't really feeling us. Maybe she was just having a rough night. Like I said, the rolls were good.  I ordered ribs and they were dry, like they had been sitting out for a while. The waitress brought my wife the wrong salad and then begrudgingly replaced it. I was parched waiting for her to bring water around. Maybe she was just having a rough night. There is always the rolls."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here, it was gratifying. Ordered a sangria margarita, house salad, cowboy cut steak and loaded potato. Thats all you need to feel as full as thanksgiving.  I probably wont eat till tomorrow.. The steak was at its perfection, staff was friendly and attentive..  too full to write more but moral of the story you should try it :)"}
{"text":"I usually don't care for chains, however I forgot how great Texas Roadhouse is. Keep in mind as I always mention I'm pescatarian so you would think this place isn't for me, but I must say the salmon here is made to perfect. From the fresh dinner rolls to the honey butter spread given with them, to the crisp cool Caesar salad and yummy baked potatoes. Of course you can load the potatoes too whether it's a regular one or sweet potato( which I'm kind of interested in trying one day if no meat is involved). This was a dinner suggestion made by my bf that I greatly appreciated! Besides the great food, the service was impeccable. I really hate that I can't remember our servers name because she really deserves a shoutout but if you ever go to the this location look for a dirty blonde server maybe around 5'5 with big curly hair pulled into a ponytail she was great. She stayed on top of checking on us, was super polite, and made sure all of our food came out fresh. Now that I remember, I'll be returning soon"}
{"text":"Steaks were ok at best, and ordered green beans as a side. I love green beans in almost any preparation, but these were *disgusting.* Limp and canned, with some god-awful liquid smoke/bacon flavoring, and so salty I could only take two bites. I had my friend try some, and he agreed they were awful. They would do much better with steamed or lightly buttered green beans - at least one healthy veggie side besides salad anyway!  I will say it's a good place for families with kids, but I don't know if I'd personally go back."}
{"text":"Had a great time celebrating my daughters bday this morning at the arcade and bowling/laser tag. So by 1pm we were hungry and tired from the activities. We needed something hardy and delicious. We opted for Texas Roadhouse. It was conveniently close by as well as having yummy food.   Since it was lunch time on a Saturday, we expected the wait to be longer, however, we were seated right away. Thankfully we had an amazing server. I wish I had remembered her name. Oh wait. I have the receipt. Let me go check. ................ok I got it. Her name was Gabby and she was great. Very attentive and readily available for anything we needed. She was on top of her game.   So with all the running around and party planning,  I was excited to sit down to a big steak lunch with some sort of alcoholic beverage. LoL . I chose the Kenny chesney , at least I think that's what it was called. It was good. Although for my taste, it was just a blue kool aid drink.   Pure sugar and water. But who doesn't like blue berry ice kool aid. Am I right?  LoL"}
{"text":"We were running late and decided to stop in for a quick lunch. I've never had a problem with my meal at any of their locations. My husband ordered a burger which he really enjoyed. And let me day I've always enjoyed their fillet and ribeye. Today I decided to go with the prime rib. Our meal arrived quickly and the server was very nice and polite. However, my prime rib was very rare even though I ordered it medium. I didn't think it would be a big deal. They took it back and I expected it back quickly. My husband was halfway done with his burger and my steak was still not back. The server came back twice to inform me it should be out soon but it wasn't.  My husband literally finished his meal when my prime rib arrived looking like it has been ran over and later burnt. It looked black and gray. It smelled old and could I barely cut into it. They also forgot my baked potato when they brought my plate. Overall, I expected for the manager to come over and apologize for the long wait. I took that one bite and asked for a to go box. No discount, no customer service. The place was nearly empty and the cooks should have made a better attempt at cooking my steak. So much for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Bad experience. We had a large party (8 people) and the food came out in sections. Told us the food had touched down at another table and they had to remake a few plates. That is fine, no problem. We asked to speak to the manager due to it being really late even though remade and the managers story was that the waitress did not hit the \"large order\" button and that's why the orders didn't come out together and No food was dropped anywhere else and had to be remade.  Ok.... Who's lying to us? We really didn't care until we got the two stories. At that point it would have been ok except, the waitress NEVER came back! All drinks were empty!!!! The food was dropped by another waiter with a.... \"Here's your food\" and no drinks! You would have thought complaining to the manager that they would have stepped up their service. NOPE, from that point we had to ask someone else for the check, another person for a to go box.   Hey Texas Roadhouse--- it's time to get another restaurant manager and kinder servers with some customer service skills, preferably ones that don't lie when there is a mistake made. Get it together or you will lose more customers. I am not recommending this restaurant to anyone unless it changes. Read some of the other one and two star reviews as they have a lot of validity. This will go on Facebook too."}
{"text":"Was craving some beef and so headed over to this joint. The restaurant was packed and they don't take reservations so waited about 40 minutes for a table of 2 at 6pm.   The prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge.  Come hungry as most people were leaving with doggy bags."}
{"text":"It was Friday before Christmas and all through the house; not a person was cooking, so we headed on out!  We were in the mood for some ribs and fix'ins, and only Texas ribs would do.  If you've been to Tex-ass, you know what I mean. One of those full racks of ribs, or pull pork meals.  Gooo-dd!    Short of twelve hours on US Highway 10, we decided to go to Mesa instead. Our choices was Logan's Roadhouse, Famous Dave's or Texas Roadhouse; we decided to come here since it's been awhile.   What can I say, some things never change and TR is real good at filing a craving. As I said in my tip, the wait time on a Friday night before Christmas was short, only seventeen minutes. They have nice little setup where one of their two managers has a headset connected with the bus'ers. So, as one customer leaves, the table is cleared in seconds. My guess is fifteen seconds, tops!  Beauty in action.   The three of us ordered: the Pulled Pork Dinner for $9.49; the Chicken Tenders dinner with biscuit gravy for $9.99; the Full Slab of Ribs for $17.49 and a whole bunch of sides that came with the dinner. The only extra is what I call the cardiac arrest, Loaded Steak Fries.  It was topped with cheese and bacon, a $0.99 up charge.   Lemonade and pop ran us $2.39 each.   The music was loud, the food was okay and it hit the spot.  One of the fun things about Texas Roadhouse is how the wait staff does some line dancing every 30/45 minutes, or so.  It's fun to watch, but none of the customers near the bar joined in.   Our server Megan and the rest of the staff kept all our drinks filled and tag-teamed our table with biscuits and services. We thought the bill for three of $45.63, was about right before tip and taxes.   We do not get down this way much, but we'll be back."}
{"text":"This is THE steak place.  I have been to other Texas roadhouses in the local area and have found them to be inconsistent in regards to quality, service and product.  This is on of the great ones.  I have the 8 oz sirloin steak.  It was about as good as any filet I've had at other more up scale restaurants.  The service was excellent and the sides were also as good as the steak.  This location evidently is know for quality since I have found it a bit crowded most days.  I have had to resort to the bar area to capture a good seat, without the wait.  If you plan on going, go on-line and put your name into their list.  They do not take reservations, but, by signing in on line it will minimize the wait at the restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant has continued to maintain a very high quality of product since my last review.  There are times  when a restaurant opens it is at the top of it's game and as time moves on, things start to diminish.  Not so for this location.  I have eaten here numerous times since the opening and the staff is till friendly, helpful, accommodating and well versed on how to treat customers.  I have talked to the management staff and they too have the same attitudes as the wait staff.  The overall success of this location is a result of good management and attention to detail.  Not all Texas Roadhouse locations are the same, this one stands out from the rest for its quality and management style.      The food is still great and the before 6 PM specials are a good touch and a very good value."}
{"text":"I took a couple of my friends for an early holiday dinner. We ordered the Cactus Blossom Appetizer which was loaded with grease. I understand they deep fry it, but I've never had one so greasy. The service was OK. It wasn't the worst I have experienced, but definitely not the best. One of my friends ordered a 12 ounce ribeye cooked medium rare. I ordered a 10 ounce ribeye cooked medium. Our steaks arrived and I noticed mine was slightly larger than my friends. My friend cut his entire steak and was eating eat. I had a couple of bites and noticed that my steak was still mooing... I realized that they completely messed up our order. The size and cook on the steaks was wrong. I told the server and she said that she would send it back to cook it longer. I ate a roll while I waited. Eventually, the manager came back with my steak. He nonchalantly asked me to check it. I said it was fine. It really wasn't, but I didn't want to send it back again. This time it was overcooked. When it was time to pay, I noticed there was $2 taken off of the bill. I assumed it was the Veteran discount that the restaurant offers on Mondays. My friends told me it was supposed to be a 30% discount. I asked the server and she said oh, that was for the steak being cooked wrong. She applied the local hero discount. I couldn't believe for two errors in the kitchen that the manager applied a credit of $2. The cost of the steaks were $35.98. I felt insulted. I really wanted to like this place because they have lots of good specials that I noticed when I was walking up to the restaurant. And, a great appreciation for military veterans. My Dad is an Air Force Veteran. I was going to tell him about the discount, but this experience made me not want to tell him."}
{"text":"Ive been to many Texas Road houses across the country but this one was very dissapointing. The food was cooked sloppily, my steak was supposed to be medium rare but it was overdone and chewy and grisly, my side of rice was overcooked and tasted like mush. The waitress forgot everything we would ask for and had to come back several times for something as simple as steak sauce.   The only redeeming factor is the bread was always delicious and amazing as usual."}
{"text":"I like popping in here early 4pm grab a seat in the bar area and order some nice cold beers and a steak. I have to say I really like the rolls and cinnamon butter. I would have to say easy on the salt on the steak and meat. My steak was done right just like I like it just saltier than what I am use to in a rib eye steak.  I will be back and maybe I need to request no salt.  Happy Travels Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Steak was very thin and fatty! Yuck! And the bartender was awesome and sweet! Just wish the food was presented with more honor and respect when presented to the table! That's all!"}
{"text":"Overall 4 stars- I was not expecting the Country Fried Chicken to be the way it was. It wasn't my cup of tea. BUT!  The ribeye and chicken breast grilled was good.. The fried pickles almost like home cooked and the bread is to die for! Will be going back for more maybe try the ribs.."}
{"text":"Good food. But I ended up calling ahead and they said that the table will be ready for us at 6:30. But when we finally showed up they told us that we have to wait 10 to 20 minutes. 30 minutes later we ended up getting seated. Very unacceptable."}
{"text":"We visit this place the first time on new years eve with our kids  they love that place . We called earlier that day to make reservation but they said they will not take any reservations for that day  and we should call a hour a head of us coming so we would not have to wait that long,and we did that but still waited 55 min with lots of other people. First the Place is not very clean ,they give out free peanuts ,the floor is full of peanut shells(great place for elephant) and waiting as long as we did  we had a lot of time  to checking the place out ,look up or up and around you,not a very clean place.  The place is extremely loud  and if you have people with you who have a soft voice you have a hard time hearing others on your table. I think our waitress was fake can't stand fake people at all. We waited about 30 min for our drinks ,our waitress had enough time to do some country line dancing and then came up to take our order but we told her we would like our drinks first and we got them right away.  Don't like the cinnamon in the butter at all  ,love the rolls. I had BBQ ribs that were good,but I can get them also that way someplace I enjoy more then that place that is for sure. The rest of the table had steak and they loved it ,good for them. I also had  2 glasses of  wine $5.99 a glass wow I can almost get a bottle in the store for that price .   I guess that place is for younger generation . Oh and they play country music that I  can't stand either,lol. The prices are some what ok  ."}
{"text":"Our second time there in the last few months and again we were dissappointed. I think we will try other steak places for awhile, there has clearly been some changes in staff, managers etc. The quality of the service and food was sub-par. We were there after 1pm , hardly anyone there and waited over 45 minutes for our food or even the salad that came with our meal. Meanwhile, as we waited we witnessed other people sending their food back. Sad really."}
{"text":"Do not stop,  do not sit in the restaurant,  go see Haley in the bar for the best  service and most enjoyable dining experience. Roadhouse is what it is.   Good steaks at a price less than the competition. This is not  fine dining, nor does it pretend to be.  Servers like Haley make the difference.  Professional,  fun,  attentive.  Hoo ray! Well be back."}
{"text":"We've come here a few times over the years but I always forget to write a review so I can remember if we like it or not. Long story short... the service is good and the food is decent but it lacks that special something to make it worth the wait.   Our server was really friendly and attentive on a busy night, unfortunately the music was so loud it was hard to have a conversation. The food was decent but not memorable."}
{"text":"I like that they have a little bit of everything to please the entire family. Trying to be a little healthy I still had options like the pork chops or grilled chicken. I went with BBQ grilled chicken, salad and steamed vegetables. Very good! Good service and friendly. Several dinners priced at 9.99 so that's good also."}
{"text":"We love Texas Roadhouse! If you go on a weekend it will be packed and you will have an hour or more wait they do have  call ahead seating so I recommend using that. During the week it's way less congested we didn't have a wait at all tonight. We are always promptly greeted and when you get to your table they serve you delectable hot fresh rolls with cinnamon better and you can have all you want. It is quite nosey in here again more so on the weekend or holidays so be prepared to talk loudly. Tonight I ordered the 8 oz sirloin medium with mushrooms, loaded mashed potatoes and a house salad. The salad is fresh crisp lettuce, tomato, bacon, egg and croutons, the dressing my choice ranch is exquisite. The steak was served perfectly cooked and the potatoes were luscious. My niece got a loaded sweet potato which comes with cinnamon butter and marshmallows this is her favorite. I have had the rice, corn, baked potato, green beans , and chili on other visits and they are all very good. Our service was really nice and very attentive and I have never had a problem with the staff they are always very nice and willing to do whatever you ask. I recommend if you are in the mood for delicious steak Texas Roadhouse is where you want to go. Its way better than its 2 competitors down the road."}
{"text":"I came here two nights ago with my boyfriend to celebrate his graduation from ASU. I know he wanted this because of one thing: the rolls. The only meat I'll even TRY to eat is chicken (after being vegetarian for 2 years) and he's not much of a steak person.  Anyhow, it was about dinner time (6ish) and we were seated right away. Our waitress, Kimberly was her name, was very friendly and helpful and kept getting whatever we needed even when she accidently brought a sweetened tea to the table instead of an un-sweetened.   Our food was pretty good. I hadn't had the chicken \"critters\" in over two years, but they were just \"ok\" this time. Maybe because I hadn't had them in so long? Either way, it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Just leaving the parking lot and had to write a review. Food was very good. We had the onion blossom, ribs and steak combo, and the catfish.  Everything was super good, but those rolls?? Oh my gosh those rolls..... with the whipped cinnamon butter..... so good. Bought a dozen (only 4.99$) to take home. Portions were great, we have a huge take home bag. To top it off we had an AMAZING waiter,  Derek.  If you go there ask for Derek!! He was so attentive, yet not over bearing. He has a fantastic personality and makes you feel very welcome and it's a nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle this time of year.  First time in, definitely won't be our last!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant close to home, the food is excellent, can't beat the rolls and cinnamon butter, I either get a steak and baked potato with a side salad or I get the chicken critters with fries and a salad.. Best Ranch dressing around!"}
{"text":"Though I've had some decent food at Texas Roadhouse out of the area, this location, unfortunately, did not do well the several times I went there for lunch or dinner.  Service was great, or at least our waitress had an amazing nice shaped arse which made up for some of the otherwise poor dining experience.   On to the food - wifey ordered a steak and it was so tough she couldn't chew it. We were going to send it back but it took them too long to notice -- on the plus side, they took it off our bill and apologized. Thanks +1 star for that.  There are TVs on, not loud. There is music, also not so loud, it's just overall loud as hell  and I don't mean because of the constant barge of yeehaws or call/response for birthdays.  I don't know if it's bad acoustics or what, but if I were a sound engineer I'd map that place out, then do something to dampen the noise.  I ordered a ribeye, medium rare. On the plus side, it was cooked perfectly. However, although these are hand picked and carved, I guess they cut corners better than meat, or maybe the chef missed this was about half fat which I had to trim off, along with stringy parts I wasn't able to cut.  Evidence of a bad slice left for the waitress to see, she got a good look but stayed silent as she removed my plate at the end. Not a question \"Did you enjoy your steak? Was it cooked well? Did it taste ok? Was it a bit too fat?\" None of that. -1 star there.  Drink menu has a few fruity cocktails and margaritas, beer selection awful unless you like commercial lager/pilsner in a frozen glass, then go ahead. They were out of the seasonal Sam Addams brew so Boston Lager was the thing and it tasted stale, also served in a chilled mug. I happen to like the taste of beer, don't mask it with ice cold containers please.  For a steakhouse, some darker brews compliment the meat. (Point here: Texas Roadhouse doesn't have them). Try a Guinness or a porter, really. Room temperature glass. You'll thank me. You're welcome. Every other bar in the area has at least a few locally produced ales and usually given in a proper glass. It's a science like wine, different shapes for different tastes. Keep the cans of cheap beer for hot summer days where you don't care how many or how often you drain them. Nuff said.  Parking is decent though at times odd because of the way these places are right angled along 75th, you may have to circle around or use adjacent parking for Desert Sky Mall.   Tip: They have lunch/early dinner specials so come earlier to get in on that or for when it's less crowded.  Note to management or brand owners: I really really want to like Texas Roadhouse, and not just for the cute staff. Please fix the problems with the food and the beer selection, so we can enjoy the full experience like a Texas Roadhouse is supposed to be."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. Our group had steak kabobs w/baked potato, ribeye w/sweet potato, beef tip w/mashed potatoes, prime rib w/fries and sirloin w/fries. Very tender and hot. We all had salad with very crispy lettuce. All could not have been better Service was great and it was very clean. Very crowded but that was expected for a Friday nite."}
{"text":"Big chain restaurant.  I mention this because I've yet to eat at a chain restaurant and give a 5 Star rating.  Saying that, 3 Stars is pretty amazing.  If you're looking for a steak, it's not a bad place to go.  The food has always come out on time, and the help has always been great.  The food is just \"typical\".  Nothing earth shattering, just good."}
{"text":"Been here a thousand times and usually very good. Tonight the Mac n cheese was definitely out of a box, the potato skins were pure grease and our steak was fatty. Sorry Texas Roadhouse but I'm done, won't be back"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service....enjoyed great meal with my brothers...Levi provided first class service...great location!"}
{"text":"This place had been good the other times I was here. The wait time is always ridiculous, its really not good enough to justify that long of a wait. I had to meet co workers here for a business dinner, I thought I would try the \"fall of the bone\" ribs that the menu advertised. When something is cremated, it usually does fall of the bone, they were way overcooked, and I have never been one to send food back, so glad I wasn't paying this time. The rolls and butter, and peanuts were good though."}
{"text":"I go here frequently, and i can honestly say i've never been disappointed.  On my most recent visit, i got the Bone in Ribeye and it was exceptional.  Again, the crowd pretty much tells you all you need to know."}
{"text":"First time here and we have reservation for 1800  but the manager told us our table  not  available yet and bec we r a grouñ of them they cant do anyghing abt this IT Sucks for  big groups even with reservation"}
{"text":"My husband and I rarely go out for date night but we decided to for New Years Day.   When we sat down, we knew exactly what we wanted because we have gone to the TRH around Metro center and it was AMAZING.  So we ordered right away and our server was very nice.  Both of us ordered the filet medallions done medium.  We waited longer than the other tables (who were all sat after us) for our food.  Maybe 40 mins or so.   When we finally got our food- one was missing rice.  And both were cooked well done.  They took our plates back and we sat for another 20 mins waiting to eat.  Manager came by to appoligize.  We told him we understood- it was busy after all.  He told us he would \"take care of it\".  Then our server (who was still very pleasant) came back with our new plates.  She said she was sorry and that the manager was going to take care of it.  Apparently \"take care of it\" no longer means taking it off the bill btw. One of my filets were still well done and my rice was cold.  Not cool.  Cold.  But I was pretty hungry so I just shut up at that point.  The loaded mashed potatoes were awesome.  And I have to say their house salad is amazing too. Waitress comes by and asks if it is way better. I just smiled and asked for the check.  She asked if we wanted refills on our tea.  I said no thank you, just the check please.  And she said ok and left.   For 30 MINUTES!!!!!   I was so flaming mad.   When she finally remembered us I got the check and it had a $10 discount on it.  So that is how the manager \"took care of it\".  2 hours later we finally left.  :( date night offically ruined."}
{"text":"Super Awesome... Steaks were great... Sarah was so sweet and perky... The sweet tea good and plentiful. We went for my daughter birthday but she didn't want to do the sit on the saddle thingy"}
{"text":"We celebrated our twins' birthday there (and our aunt's birthday too). I wish I could remember our servers name, he was a younger guy, a little reserved but friendly and efficient without being overbearing; the perfect server! Always there to refill drinks and checking in at the perfect times without annoying us constantly! I think from the bill I remember his name had four letters but I can't remember what his name was!   We were there last Wednesday and we sat our party of 14 on the patio, which was perfect. It was a beautiful night, the patio is covered but there's still air flow. They turned the music down outside so we could hear each other talk and we were the only ones out there. It was quiet and it was nice to catch up with family with a good meal.   The salad was really good. The last time we came here the lettuce was bad but this time it was good. Maybe they listened to my complaint last time :). Most of us got the 8oz sirloin with 3 shrimp which is a great deal on Wednesday nights. The steak was so good. Really perfect. And the kids had ice cream for their birthday. Very nice. Only no one sang to them, maybe because we were outside. Bummer. Lose a star for that... birthdays are a big deal to a kid and I think they should have known that and got a group to come sing to them. Texas Roadhouse isn't exactly cheap so we deserved that at least. Oh well, everything else was good. We will be back."}
{"text":"If I could give this place is zero I would. this is the fifth time we have been here and every single time they say 20 to 30 or 40 minutes whatever it maybe and it always ends up being almost 2 hour wait time and the food comes cold people are nasty and rude I'm so done with this place"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Angry Crab Shack and after that experience headed directly here for the standard Excellent Service and Excellent Food.   Always great good and great service.!!!"}
{"text":"Called last night @ 4:30 and tried to do call ahead seating for 6:30 for a party of 9. We are in town and are here to see some friends. Explained to hostess that some in the group are seniors so would need to have assurance on reservation. I was told to call back in an hour, the thought process by her was that it was too soon to give me a time and they weren't that busy yet. So I did as told and called back and after about 10 minutes of confusion and other waiting I was told we couldn't be seated until 7:30 or we could have seperate booths. I explained that we needed to sit together and 2 hours was the best she could do. I was so frustrated I told her no thanks that we would find other arrangements. She said ok and that was it. Nice job Texas Roadhouse. NOT!!! There is no excuse for not having a reservation system in place, like Open Table. One day there will be no customers to disappoint, then maybe you will get it."}
{"text":"Have eaten at this location multiple times and have always had a pleasant experience besides tonight. We sat there for awhile before we were even greeted by our waitress (Erica). She hardly payed any attention to our table. We were never offered refills on our drinks and the mushrooms we ordered never even came out. We were pretty disappointed by the service we received tonight."}
{"text":"I understand that the place doesn't open until 3. But why leave people waiting outside in the Phoenix 102 degree heat when they could let people in and let them wait inside the waiting area !?!?!? I would give ZERO stars if I could......"}
{"text":"I have been to Texas Roadhouse before, but not this particular one. Our first time was out on the west side, and that was several years ago.  Its every bit as good as I remember it!  First off the rolls with cinnamon butter - WOW!  I shared the rack of ribs with my wife and they were off the hook. All the veggies were good. Even the UNSWEETENED tea was good!  Seating and service was good. Not a single complaint. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"This is a fun 'once in while' restaurant for us when we're craving steaks and those amazing rolls.  Our experience last night was pretty good.  Our server was training another server so they were very attentive.   My medium well steak was undercooked so it was taken back to the kitchen and I was brought an order of fries to snack on.  Because of the long recooking time, the manager visited our table and my part of our dinner was taken off our bill, which was very generous."}
{"text":"Prime rib was great. Only complaint was server took some time when refilling drinks. @4pm I wouldn't think they are all that busy, there were plenty empty table and we had not wait time. My kid got \"road kill\" and was nothing more then hamburger meat under cooked. That and drink refills was only issue."}
{"text":"First off, I have been around to many restaurants and I live and breathe hospitality.  My wife and I decided to come to this place to dinner because I had never been there. Yes when you walk in there are peanut shells everywhere and country music playing. My kind of place and what else would you expect from a place called Texas RoadHouse.  We were seated within the 20 minutes we were quoted and greated immediately by our server Cathy! She was very attentive no matter how busy she was while the entire restaurant was really busy. The only thing I can say is that this is the best customer service by a server in a really long time.  We are concerned about being in the back corner but our attitudes had changed as soon as Cathy had shown up! She honestly was the best server with placing our child's food first and being on top of it. Cathy is the best and if I owned a restaurant I would be happy to have her as a server or a floor manager. Long story short, my wife and I will be back for another great experience with Cathy!"}
{"text":"My margarita was really watery and you couldnt even tell there was alcohol in it such a disappointment but my steak was made perfectly!!!! And my loaded potato was to die for! And their rolls and their butter just on point everytime i go and very economical ! Must visit"}
{"text":"I'll pass then.    I heard when the employees line dance , basically that's their top priority and then you get your food.  For example: there was a waitress bringing food to a customer, and it was line dancing time, so she put the food down, danced, then handed it to the customer."}
{"text":"I went here this past Sunday 2/15. I must say I was very pleased. I definitely recommend it and I will be going again"}
{"text":"It's A-Ok.  It's decent.  It's a good value.  So here's what I like: - It's large, with lots of tables, so you don't have to wait long for a table. - The peanuts are fun. - My kids like it, and they have good kids meals. - It's a good value.  Here's what could be better: - The steaks are inconsistent and some times kind of low quality. - The rest of the menu is okay, but nothing special (e.g., salads, sides, etc.). - While servers are usually friendly, it gets very slow sometimes."}
{"text":"I've always loved Texas Roadhouse where ever I go because they're very consistent with food quality and service. They have great food at reasonable prices.  The atmosphere is always fun too.  I've been to almost all of them in the east valley and it's our go to for dinner and drinks before concerts on the west side. This particular establishment has the same food quality and service but's freezing inside!! My food got cold right away because the fans are on so high the cold air blows your napkin around.  And it doesn't matter where you sit.  The place in an ice cube.  I asked the bartender and a hostess if there was anyway to lower the fans and vents but it was no help.   The draft beer is ice cold and served in chilled mugs which would have been nice to enjoy if I didn't feel like i was sitting in a cooler.  We live in always sunny Phoenix but that day was about 67 degrees outside and inside felt about the same. I looked around at other customers and I could tell they were cold as well.  Later we went to visit with some friends and they told me that this Roadhouse is always freezing inside and to that they bring a hoodie when they go there.  I'm not kidding!  So the food was great even though it cold before I could finish it and the service was nice but I doubt I will go back to this restaurant unless I'm wearing proper cold weather clothes.  JAH"}
{"text":"Bad service, we ordered a salad and my dad ordered a grilled pork shop, pork shop came out raw super pink inside, he tells manager manager says I will be out with a \"new\" one for u, I'm so sorry this happened, he waited 25 min, by that time we were done with our food and she brings him the same piece of pork chop STILL raw inside he got upset and just said my family is done eating just cancel it, CANT EVEN COOK a pork chop right for crying out loud smh, hire better cooks that actually know what there doing"}
{"text":"I just want to say that this has been the best Texas Roadhouse I have been to in the valley, I usually go to Peoria and the Goodyear location, this is by far the best, my waitress could have been a bit more on top of things and our order but let me tell you they have a manager by the name of Megan, she is awesome.. Really cares about her job as a manager and makes sure by going around to all tables asking if everything is ok with a smile, like it says on her shirt, I can tell she really loves her job, good job Megan keep it up"}
{"text":"My family and I love Texas Roadhouse, we stopped in at this location, which we've never been to and will never return. Our server, Rachel was less than amused to be working and it showed big time. She never smiled and seemed bothered that we were sitting in her section. She went to the table next to us 5 times before coming to our table. She never refilled our drinks and took our steak sauce, even after I told her, I was going to use it. We practically had to beg for our check, as she wasn't taking no to dessert for an answer. We did not feel welcome and will never return to this location."}
{"text":"We love love love Texas Roadhouse, when we first arrived there was a 15 to 20 min wait to be seated. It didn't take that long and we maybe waited 10 mins total. That's a good thing. Our server Kaylyn was fantastic, super nice, checked on us often and had a great attitude. The food as usual was also fantastic and we also didn't have to wait long for it to arrive at the table. We were happy the whole visit and will be sure to return to this location. Thanks again Texas Roadhouse!"}
{"text":"Good food, good price. The only negative remark I could make is that the serving sizes are too big. We took home the leftovers had them the next day and they still tasted good. The place is a bit noisy, but we knew it would be."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely fresh and delicious!  I was even more impressed with the service we had.  Our waitress was extremely good all the way down to the very polite bus boy that took our plates.  I rarely get over to the east side of town but this is one place that I will make the exception for!"}
{"text":"I generally enjoy their rolls and butter cinnamon butter.   I had their burger and a salad this go around but typically I would order their petite sirloin and baked potato.  It is always packed and loud.   I absolutely enjoy being able to select music from their juke box!  The kids got the pleasure listening to my beautiful singing."}
{"text":"The steak was grilled to perfection, just like it always is at Texas Roadhouse. And to top it off our server was awesome. She made the experience top notch. I personally recommend this location... Or any Texas Roadhouse for that matter."}
{"text":"I have been to the Roadhouse numerous times before - the food is hit or miss depending on the day. However I wanted to make reservations for a party of 15 there for a birthday - when I called to do that the manager then told me we would all have to sit apart because there is no room to put 15 people together.  We had gone here last year and this hadn't been a problem - he then told me they remodeled and the restaurant was mostly boothes now.  I was very disappointed - so no large parties can do anything here anymore otherwise they have to sit separately? I told him that was too bad and I wouldn't be having the birthday there then.  I am just totally disappointed to find this out - not a very family friendly environment if you can't sit with your whole family...."}
{"text":"Love going to this Texas Road House  Since first open way back 2000  Staff always Friendly helpbfull  Food always AWSOME. Prices are reasonable. I love my Sirloin Steak medium Rare always comes out excelent. They had once Trout there but they took it  off.  But like I said before Texas Road House at this location they are NUMBER 1 ."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I gotta tell you the ribs are amazing. The few times I've been lucky enough to be seated in Shelly's section I'm treated like a king. Thanks again!!"}
{"text":"I've always had really good food here. It's pretty overpriced for what you're getting but the service is always really great."}
{"text":"First if all, I love Texas Roadhouse! They are consistently good no matter which location you go to.  This TR has been open a couple if weeks and so it is still extremely busy anytime of the day! We did a call ahead on a Friday night at 5:30 and were told to arrive at 6:00. When we got there we were given a buzzer and told it would be just a few minutes. We walked outside to sit down and the buzzer went off. Granted we were just a party if two but still I totally recommend using the call ahead feature!  My husband got the prime rib and I had the filet. Both were outstanding! The rolls are always to die for and the margaritas are yummy as well.   They did do one of their line dances while we were there so it was entertaining to watch while we waited for our food. Even though they were packed, and will be for some time, our food arrived quickly and correct! Can't wait to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"It's good but not great. You can choose your steak when you come in. Service was excellent but food was soso. It's worth a try."}
{"text":"This place is always crowded.  Be prepared to wait for 5 - 10 minutes for a party of 3 even on a Monday night.  I like the warm rolls and honey butter that you get served right away.  The peanuts on the table are a perk for some also.  Really like the 21oz bone in rib eye.  The salad with blue cheese is also good.  Was not as much a fan of the Sirloin but I usually am not."}
{"text":"I have been to Roadhouse places all over the country, and this was not one of the better ones sadly, especially since it's the new one close to me. Service was okay, but they didn't bring us any hot rolls until we asked when dinner came. They hand tons of staff standing around not doing much lots of the time.   As for the food I had my usual pork chop dinner, and the chops were well done and very salty, as was the peppercorn sauce that comes with it. Thankfully I like salt, but it was over the top. My wife like her Chicken salad, but it didn't look like anything special. I was shocked the the maybe 3+oz of wine my wife ordered was $8.99. Across the parking lot from this location is Total Wine and More, and I could have got a whole bottle of the same Kendal Jackson for $5.99. Talk about markup!   Most locations I've been to are active, and lively. This one is quite, and slower. There were no birthday call-outs, no line dances, no activity at all. It is a new site, so maybe they'll get better as time goes on."}
{"text":"I met friends for dinner at this restaurant. It took the server more than a half hour to take our orders. My meal was so extremely salty I couldn't eat it. The server was kind enough to offer to have it remade but I figured it would be the same so I asked for a side salad instead. She didn't charge me, which I didn't expect. We stayed and talked for a while and when our waters were refilled they had soggy bits of paper at the bottom. We asked for fresh glasses and those also came back with paper floating in them. She decided it was the ice that might have pieces of paper from straw wrappers or napkins that had fallen into the ice storage. Eeew! I feel that quality control is definitely missing at this location."}
{"text":"Good as usual!  Gotta love the free peanuts and delicious rolls. I also like the chili cheese fries. Mostly 4 stars because the meals are so cheap."}
{"text":"Another great experience!!!  Our server Kelly was fantastic!  The bone-in Ribeye and sweet rolls were dream worthy."}
{"text":"Very good food, the steaks are delicious! 11 oz vs. the 8 oz steak is recommended though. The freshly baked bread so good. we dined there numerous times and the only issue I have is that our high pitched speaking waitress was digging in her teeth in the floor length mirror and then came back to the floor without a beat, serving customers which is a concern health-wise."}
{"text":"Just moved to Belmont from California and decided to try this for my birthday dinner. It's not a fancy steakhouse, but we knew that. The food was good. I had the country fried sirloin and my wife had the 6 oz sirloin. I often find this lacking salt at other restaurants. Not here. Everything was well-seasoned and cooked just right. The rolls and cinnamon butter they start you with is amazing. The \"cactus blossom\" was better than any \"awesome blossom\" I've had at another popular steak place. Their first timer sample plate was a nice touch. Next time I get the country fried sirloin, I'll be having the mashed potatoes which were obviously made from scratch and delicious. The chili is also awesome with chunks of steak in it. Service was friendly and quick in spite of the place being packed full. Megan was always around making sure we got drink refills and everything we needed in a timely manner. Definitely a great first experience and we will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"A steakhouse that has trouble cooking steaks to order. We had four in our party, one steak medium rare, two mediums and one medium well. All cooked medium. Don't get me wrong it was a nice cut of meat at a reasonable price, but that's useless if your cooks suck. Be very specific about how you want your beast cooked."}
{"text":"We have mostly had good experiences here but last night was so awful so here's my review.   Two $7 margaritas and I walked out completely sober. (Tried two different ones even!)  The waitress, Amber, tried to explain to me some frat bullshit she was told about having a drink that was cold, sweet, and sour and how you therefore don't taste the alcohol. I am usually toast after a half of one of the Top Shelf margaritas...and no joke, I could have passed any field sobriety test.  She was an awful waitress to begin with - although not intentionally - she just seemed to be way over her head and have some sort of short term memory problem.  She did however do what she could to make sure we left barely happy - but still charging me for $7 margaritas that I disliked was crap.  We are done with that place and that will be absolutely the last time we go back."}
{"text":"Service and food was excellent as usual. This is my favorite place to eat. Leah was a very attentive server and I noticed she didn't waste a minute of her time. Hats off to the cooks because my Fort Worth Ribeye and loaded potato were perfect and my bf's porterhouse was out of this world. You never let me down. That's why my bf brought me here for my birthday dinner. You always impress me. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Third time to Texas roadhouse and most likely the last. We ordered food at 8pm and did not get our meals until 9:15. Our server apologized for the long wait and offered us free desert, then walked away. Our food was delivered shortly... not to our surprise, the order was incomplete and not to mention the server had his fingers IN our food....I asked for mushrooms on my steak and the server completely forgot. My wife asked for a 8 oz filet and was given what looked like a 6oz. The applesauce did not come with a spoon, which you would think would be automatically assumed(it was at the last roadhouse we went to in Goodyear).I finished my water early on and was never offered a refill...  the server did not check up very often and was nowhere to be found. Later on he asked what we wanted for free desert... I said that we would pass on the free desert and he didn't offer to do anything else to make it up. We know what happened as my wife and I both previously worked in the restaurant industry... our server forgot to put in our order, then remembered about 30+ minutes, then put in the order quickly as he panicked... forgot parts of our order, then blamed it on the \"slow\" kitchen, and he didn't want to tell his manager so he offered free desert because he could get that without telling his manager. We don't care that you forgot to ring in our food into the computer, what we care about is that he did not try to make it up to us or take any accountability. We will never go back to this location again. As for the server, that was the worst service we have ever received... and we are very very nice people who know stuff happens...."}
{"text":"Texas road house has never failed for my cravings of steak!! Awesome service as always every time we go, the delicious steak cooked perfectly medium the way I wanted and always a pleasure seeing the manager greet himself! They were super busy the day before Valentine's Day and my husband and I still had a very pleasant experience and was very happy with the food portions price and quality!! You guys rock!!"}
{"text":"Came here after Spring Training. The line to be seated was quite long but for a party of two it took about 20mins. Service was great, our server was very nice. Our server brought us piping hot dinner rolls with cinnamon butter.... they are addicting! We ordered the 8oz Sirloin and Rib plate which comes with two sides (we did Ceaser salad and loaded mash potatoes; both were very tasty). We requested the steak Medium and were not disappointed, it was flavorful and juicy, possibly one of the most flavorful steaks I've had from a chain steak house. The ribs were ok, I prefer juicy ribs, these came out a bit burned and dry but our server quickly replaced them when we brought it to her attention. The second time around they were as advertised \"falling off the bone\" and tasty. The drink we were recommended was the Jamaican Cowboy Margarita and it was Amaze! I hate super sweet syrupy margaritas and this one with a salted rim was perfect. I think we'll make this part of our yearly AZ Spring training tradition."}
{"text":"This is a restaraunt that I'll frequent about once every 4-6-8 weeks or so depending on the occasion. The meal starts out with super yummy dinner rolls with the extra yummy cinnamony buttery spread (whatever it is). I normally don't go for sweet things. But I do have a soft spot for things with cinnamon in them. And these rolls with this spread was marvelous as usual. I've taken a picture of the items and have uploaded it to the photo section of this restaraunt.  Next up is a 10 oz Ribeye. The cut of beef with the best marbeling for grilling. As anyone knows, it's the fat (or oil) that transmits flavor in food. The steak arrived and looks absolutely marvelous (also took a picture and uploaded it).  A perfect medium that I will dig into very shortly. Very, very tastey steak.   The server was exceptional. When my coke got to about half full, she brought another.  Very nice attitude.  Good visit.    5 stars.!"}
{"text":"BEST service I had since I moved here in Phoenix. First waiter I had that was very attentive. He made sure our drinks were filled. That's what I like about waiters/waitress. Also, very quick service. Coming back more often :) steak was delish."}
{"text":"I love coming to this restaurant. Every visit is a pleasure. The staff is friendly, the good is the best in steakhouse fair and is very affordable. They offer endless freshly baked rolls, with cinnamon butter that is just to die for. Beer is ice cold and delicious, their mixed drinks are huge, however I've never tried one. The beer is good enough for me. Free peanuts while you wait :)"}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse provided free lunches on Vererans Day to all Veterans and they did a wonderful job. The restaurant was very crowded, but the staff worked hard and was very friendly. The food arrived hot and was delicious. Texas Roadhouse made a lot of families and Veterans happy.  A special thank you to Katie, who worked at the bar, for delivering exceptional customer service and for taking good care of the Veterans who were dining alone and sat at the bar.  Katie made the Veterans feel appreciated."}
{"text":"This review will be brief and it saddens me to write. Texas Roadhouse has ALWAYS been that chain steak-house that stood out loud and proud as the exception to the rule! You can IN FACT get an exceptional steak at a reasonable price with fantastic service.   Unfortunately my last two visits to this chain, specifically the Willoughby location resulted in food quality reminiscent of a chain. The food was fair at best. The steak on both occasions slightly overcooked and lacking in flavor and texture.  One of the two steaks was so tough that I never made it past the first couple bites.  I had for years enjoyed this restaurant and may give it one last try soon. I am certainly hopeful that I simply hit a bump in the road with Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Management talked to me once after this and I waited several months to see if they would help me resolve this bit I guess stealing from their customers is ok with this restaurant, so hold on to your wallets here"}
{"text":"I went in the other day with my family, 4 young children, my wife and I, and we were seated right away. Our server was amazing. She made sure we were taken care of during our meal, which was freaking delicious. She was attentive but never annoying about it. I will definitely be going back and hopefully she will be our server again!"}
{"text":"What Aloha! We had a huge group figuratively and literally. Offered us bread baskets while we waited. Our waitress was so accommodating to our crowd and very patient. The food was terrific and service on point."}
{"text":"Round #2 at the Roadhouse and still... surprisingly... 4 stars.  Telling my mother I wanted to take her and dad out for their 47th anniversary (47 years!), instead of the nicer places that I rattled off, she picked Roadhouse (she must think I am one pricey dinner away from living in my 4runner, she won't let me spend any money on them).  So at 4:45 on a Saturday, we hit the silver fox crowd at the Roadhouse.  No wait when we arrived, since most people are still digesting lunch, Haley's section wasn't available (the great waitress from our previous visit), so we were sat in Joey's section - and we hit the server lottery again - he was fantastic.  Drinks stayed filled; he had suggestions for my diabetic, salt-sensitive, picky eater dad; attentive without hovering - he was top notch.    And I say this with a straight face, and it pains me mucho, but my order of the 20 oz. bone-in ribeye may have been one of the tastiest steaks that I have had in years (this goes up against steaks from Firebirds, Ruth's Chris, Capital Grille, etc.).  (I know!)  It was juicy, cooked to an absolute perfect medium and not overly seasoned as the mid-range steak places tend to do.  The accompanying baked potato was fluffy and jammed with butter, sour cream, BACON and cheddar (one of my last meals before starting Weight Watchers, I wanted to make it count).  The onions that I got as a side needed to be cooked a little longer for my taste, but they were okay.  The salad that came before everything was served in a chilled bowl with fresh ingredients.  And the rolls were warm and soft, served with their cinnamon sugar whipped butter.  Mom was happy with her ribeye (even though she thought she ordered a prime rib) and dad was satisfied with his salmon, but I think I got the top meal of the night.  Excellent service, surprisingly good food - good job, Roadhouse!"}
{"text":"Ok so we had a pretty bad experience we had a party of 5 and the service was terrible. Our waitress seen us a total of 4 times in 1and a half hrs the stake and mushrooms were Burnt both times and horrible if it wasn't for the blond manager  we would have left"}
{"text":"Not the best place, everything is greasy and the service is terrible. If you want to wait an hour and a half to be seated, this is the place for you. They even managed to make my salad disgusting once."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Really good potato skins!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner on a Sunday evening while family was visiting. Was seated in about 15 minutes and our waitress was great. Very helpful with the menu and getting anything we needed right away. She did an excellent job of suggesting items from the menu. Will definitely be back, great atmosphere, great food, excellent service."}
{"text":"Okay I feel bad giving them a 2 star review, but I will explain. We went to Texas Roadhouse twice in  two weeks.  My boyfriend, myself and a friend went, we all had the onion blossom , pretty good, the fried pickles we're better then expected and of course a few beers and stawberry banana margarita, can't go wrong with any of those. We all had the huge Tbone steak, salads and potato. Everything tasted great and I was super thrilled for my first time there. A week later we went back a took my brother, same deal same food, good stuff!   Now for the bad. The fist visit my bf and his friend felt miserable and spent forever in the bathroom. I know its gross but unless you want the same experience, I'd keep this review in mind. So after being miserable the day after we chalked it up to over eating. 2nd visit, all 3 of us same thing all over again. This time had nothing to do with over eating because we left more then a little on our plates. Everything seemed to taste fine, so I can't rule out any one part of the meal that caused it. All 3 steaks were cooked at different temperatures, we each had a different type of potato and only 2 out of the 3 of us had Caesar salad. We shared the baby blossom which we also did the 1st time, so maybe that was it. Not for sure.  So as far as my review goes, the food tasted fantastic, but I've never felt worse after eating. I really wish it was just a fluke because I was so psyched about this place. :("}
{"text":"Great place to have a great meal!  The staff is very welcoming, the cleanliness is obvious from the moment you walk in the door  This is a family friendly atmosphere where you can enjoy good company & great meals."}
{"text":"Amazing food, awesome service, great ewww at company.......all the makings  of a remarkable meal."}
{"text":"I love this place. All the ones I've ate at are great. I have never had bad service at this one."}
{"text":"Been to many Texas Roadhouse restaurants. Always great food. Huge portions. Management is very nice."}
{"text":"You don't go to Texas Roadhouse if you have a peanut allergy. The shells are everywhere in the air and on the floor. Isn't that a health code violation?   This place is a legit steakhouse --but, I can't vouch for much else on the menu."}
{"text":"We received a coupon for a free appetizer and invitation to visit their restaurant. Upon going there, we were told they couldn't accept our coupon because their system was down. I found this to be in poor taste when a manager could have easily voided it on our bill. The steaks and service were mediocre anyways, so we won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place is good, starting with the warm buns and cinnamon butter, then the deep friend cactus blossom, never leaving out one of the best side hpusr salads to many main dish choices. There are many choices of beers and are always ice cold. I have never gotten a dessert since I am always so full! Gave them 4 stars because sometimes a dish is too salty, today's it was the cactus blossom and the sirlion fried steak ... so it could be the batter??"}
{"text":"We live a few miles from Texas Roadhouse, but have only been there one.  Well I made a point to go there for dinner a few weeks ago and I am glad that I did.  The food is great and the staff is friendly.  I love that you can eat peanuts and toss the shells too.    They have some great early bird specials served until 6pm, it is worth the price.  I am going to make more of an effort to dine here more frequently with my family."}
{"text":"Today my husband and I went to this Texas Roadhouse for our anniversary and it was a FANTASTIC CHOICE! The service was quick and friendly. Our waiter kept our refills coming before we could even finish our first drink, and the bread roll came at the same pace! We both ordered the sirloin meal with Cesar salad and steak fries. Our steaks were cooked perfectly to our liking and were so juicy and flavorful! For dessert we ordered the strawberry cheesecake and I probably could have eaten about 5 more slices... so good! This is only one of many great experiences I've had at this Texas Roadhouse and what keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"I have always had amazing experiences at the Mesa location and this was my first time visiting the Tempe location.  Did call ahead seating and that worked well.  The rolls were not buttery as much as I like them and had to keep asking for more butter and rolls.  The last time they never came.  Was bummed to find that they don't (or no longer?) have a $3 margarita at all times - just during happy hour.  The ribeye, salad and sweet potato were good.  The biggest negative was that the waitress spilled an entire glass of ice water on me and inside my open purse soon after we were seated.  She was very apologetic and it wasn't a big deal - until the end of the meal when I realized my daughters iphone was in the bottom of my purse still swimming in ice and water. I let her know and she got a manager.  They were both helpful and gave me a gift certificate for two free meals.  (Paid for the two meals we had eaten last night.)  I gave the manager my name and phone number and he gave me his and the owner's business card.  Went home and put the iphone in rice overnight.  It didn't help.  The button is not working consistently and there are problems with the sound.  I am hopeful that this situation will be resolved with the restaurant but also still nervous at this point.  Fingers crossed!!  Update that management was very helpful in buying my daughter a replacement phone.  The experience was simple and straight forward.  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"There are two road houses I love, Logan's and Texas road house. If I was rich I would eat at those two places every day.  The steak is always fresh and juicy, the bread is always fresh, and the happy hours here are pretty nice. I love eating the peanuts and just throwing them on the floor that is what a road house is suppose to be like. If you come on your birthday and someone in your party tells the waitress they will pull a sattle over to your table and make you sit on it and sing you happy birthday. I went along with it since my meal was being paid for :)   If you are a fan of big steaks for under $22.00 come here and enjoy, and don't forget to stap on the A-1"}
{"text":"First rate steak done to the proper temperature (med-rare) and never over-seasoned! I would give the service and food 5 stars but come here to sit and eat only, because the atmosphere is just to loud and overbearing to enjoy conversation and company of dining companions.  Try Longhorn Steakhouse for a more pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Typical Texas Roadhouse except this one is ALWAYS jam packed on the weekend.  Call ahead or don't bother."}
{"text":"Disgusting. The Rattlesnake bites were so spicy that they had no taste, just heat. We asked the server prior to ordering how hot they were and she said a little spice. Ron, the manager??? If you can call him that..in all honesty he was a pathetic excuse of a manager and should not be in that job position. I told him they were terrible when he asked how we liked them and his response was \" they are a big seller, we make them in house\". Not I'm sorry for your experience....made in house or not, Ron, they are awful!  The ribs were tough and inedible and the bowl of mashed potatoes that we paid extra to have \"loaded\" had very little cheese a few bacon crumbles and no butter or sour cream. Ron was useless with this as well....told us he was uncomfortable talking to us and went and got a different manager...she was good, Ron, you need a new job choice..you are lousy at customer service. She comped our inedible uneaten meals and we left...our server did offer to box them up but my guess is ribs like rubber in the restaurant will still taste like rubber at home. Save your money and go elsewhere...terrible experience every time we go there."}
{"text":"It's nice that Texas road house only offers free meals for veterans until 4. Wonder if next time our troops can only put their life on the line until 4. Or my dad can trade in his broken neck at 4.... And when you ask a manager because that isnt written ANYWHERE they say \"everyone has their promotions\" Ohhhh to make money off of. Maybe they should change the saying on their shirts to we love our troops until 4. Don't worry Texas road house I proudly paid for my dads dinner and I wish I saw another veteran in there I would have paid for his or her meal too. Thanks for thanking him for his service too."}
{"text":"Not impressed, wasn't first visit. Ordered....well wanted to order the half roasted chicken and was told they are out of it and the bbq half chicken (on a Sunday at 6pm). OUT OF CHICKEN??? So proceeded to order the \"country fried chicken\" w/ mashed & gravy. When the tables food came it looked great, big fried piece of chicken w/gravy but upon eating it....let me just say \"COUNTRY\" fried you better believe it. That gravy is beyond country. You taste the whole damn farm. It tastes how cow poop smells, No other words to describe it.  I took one bite and about vomited on the table.  Sent it back and got a different replacement meal to go as the party I was there with was about done eating before to go meal came.  A manager then came to our table and asked if I still wanted the chicken, it was \"now available\" Why wasn't I told by my server that it was cooking and WILL be ready shortly?? I still would of just ordered that and waited.  Appetite was ruined after tasting the whole farm in one bite. In conclusion it wasn't our first trip, as my family likes their steak but that made it our last. I'm NOT impressed....the ONLY good thing on the menu/served are the sweet yeast rolls n butter. Oh and by the way, don't expect HALF a chicken...a baby chicken or maybe a pigeon...but this is the smallest half chicken I've ever seen in my life."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Called earlier in the day to see if we could get seated around 5 for 18 people. They said it wouldn't be a problem and to call back around 4 to confirm the seating.  I offered to put a deposit down on the reservation just to make sure we could be accommodated and the girl said it wasn't necessary.  I called back at 4 as she said and was told it would be 2-3 hours before they could seat us!  Really poor customer service in my opinion, we planned on driving over 45 minutes to get there as a surprise for one of the guests coming.  Makes me mad that I was told it wouldn't be a problem and to call back an hour prior to confirm we were coming.  Needless to say we decided to go elsewhere.  Sorry Roadhouse you lost out on a big dinner ticket tonight for lack of customer service skills."}
{"text":"A good choice for loud groups and it serves decent food at reasonable prices. Seems a big hit for Birthday party groups. Serves a decent Prime Rib."}
{"text":"We were in the area on a Saturday night around 8pm, looking for something to eat. My boyfriend gets so excited when he sees Texas Roadhouse because there really isn't one near where we live. So we stopped in and put our name into the waiting list- 45 minute wait. Typical for a Saturday night. We stopped two free seats at the bar and chose that option instead. The bartenders were friendly and extremely attentive to our needs for our dinner. They were great. Obviously, the rolls were incredible (that cinnamon sugar butter though?! *drooling*), our house salads were fresh, and we both liked our entrees a lot. My boyfriend got the burger and steak fries. I ordered the chicken critters (chicken tenders), which were SUPER fresh tasting to me. I loved them! I also love their thick steak fries- yum.   We may return for a game sometime- my bf loved their bar area and kept talking about how great it would be to come back for a Pens game."}
{"text":"Prices are climbing. But that's everywhere. Still delicious steaks every time. Our server on this visit was terrific. The front desk staff : not so much. Teen girls gathered and gossiping while customers waited. Not the first time. Management needs to address this and see that customers are greeted better. After all, we are spending a lot of money.   The drinks are ok if you order scotch and water, like I do. But beware of the mixed drinks. They are made in strict compliance with corporate directives. Which means: you have to drink several at five bucks a pop before you realize you actually had an adult beverage. Suggestion.  Be a Little less stingy on the booze. Nobody appreciates a watered down drink. Otherwise, we really enjoy the place."}
{"text":"Totally an awesome experience. Uber friendly staff, great value for steaks and quick service.   Manager even checked in to see how are first dinning experience was going. The bread is fantastically nummy..."}
{"text":"What A Great Experience.I'm so glad we now have a Road House here in the North Hills! CC our waitress, went out of her way to make our 47th Anniversary A Really good one! She's Full of personality and her attention to detail was perfect.We at one time would drive all the way to Their other location in Bridgeville. Now that we have one in NH. We will be asking for CC the next time for sure.She's only there on weekends. I was also there on Veterans Day.They treated us like KINGS! The Food Was Perfect."}
{"text":"I should have stuck with a salad! Or gotten a steak since it is a steak place. I had the grilled shrimp over rice and the shrimp was rubbery and didn't taste crisp and fresh. The rice was gummy.  The chocolate brownie dessert was hard as a freaking rock! I could barely cut it with my fork. Rolls are delicious."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!!!!!!!!!! We have been here before and the last time we were here they ran out of ribs....gave them the a second chance and once again they ran out of ribs and also had no mixed veggies!!!! Are you kidding????!!!!! They are known for their ribs!!!!! We will never go back!!!!! If I could give them less than one star I would.  The one positive was our server.  She was super delightful!!"}
{"text":"I agree with other reviewers:  Why the line dancing in the walking aisle and right at my table.  I could do without.  I did my best to ignore as did 98 percent of everyone there.Painful to watch the server who didn't know the dance and try to learn it there.  Teach them in the back room.    Food ok; I never use steak sauce and rarely use salt but felt the need to salt my steak for flavor.  The biggest turn off:  THE PLACE IS LOUD.  Louder than I can stand while I eat dinner.  Decide if you want to be a restaurant or a loud bar, adjust your stereo accordingly and the atmosphere.  I know it sounds prudish but this is no place for trying to catch up with anyone."}
{"text":"Good customer service, nice cold dining area. Food was horrible! Went here for Father's Day per my husbands request. I don't care for steaks or burgers but he does. I ordered the shrimp plate as it was one of the only 3 options I could really eat. It was awful! SUPER SALTY rice and shrimp! Small shrimp were over cooked, salt and loaded w butter. My side of steamed vegetables were practically raw and all carrots w 1 small broccoli floret. The cocktails were super small, filled with ice and over priced. My husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich which he was disappointed in, very bland and NO sauce. He had to ask for it on the side."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is probably one of my favorite place in Arizona.  The staff is always friendly.. The entrance is not very clean due to all the free peanuts by the door. Lol but that's a good and bad thing depending on who you are.  The seating time all depends on the size of your party.  All my experiences here have been relatively great.  For the past while I've tried to go in at least once a week to try and see if the taste remains consistent and so far none of the food has failed me.  But being completely honest one of the main reasons I go in is for their rolls and cinnamon butter(i think that's what it's called) I probably could just eat those and be satisfied. Haha  Like I said earlier the staff is always friendly.  this evening i was helped by Katie she was incredibly nice and personable. The all the food is reasonably priced as well in my opinion and I don't think you can really go wrong with anything on their menu. Point is that I'm always down for some Texas Roadhouse and I always recommend this place to my clients and friends."}
{"text":"Really good food.  Really good service.  Sat at the bar on a busy Friday night.  Food came out super fast. Bar tender was very attentive. Food was way better then our local outback or longhorn.  We use to go two those places frequently and don't anymore  because of the quality of food and service went downhill.  Managers both came up and made sure everything was great.  No one was overbearing.  Just really good service and good food.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonable good dinner.  Just make a reservation if you don't want to wait or sit at the bar.  Keep up the good service and the good food guys!!!"}
{"text":"Let me say the service was absolutely amazing! The place was packed, I called ahead and they put me on a waiting list. That was nice since we only waited 5 min.it was family night out with my parents and sister. Our order included steak, chicken and ribs. Food was good, only negative part was the bloody steak. We did request it be well done a couple of times when we ordered. It was sent back so it did get better. I would not rave about the ribs, they were good. They serve you warm bread as soon as you sit down, that was yummy. They serve two sides with meal, so I had a lot of left overs. Every table has a bucket full of peanuts. Country music and peanut shells on the floor, welcome to the southwest partner! I will probably go back to try the burgers. Nice place, full of energy, and great service."}
{"text":"Love this place  we  come here every year the food is great and the service as well. Steak and ribs are the best."}
{"text":"visited on  5/4/2012 . The 2 stars are because we did call ahead seating and when we arrived they didn't have our confirmation number but the girl remembered my name. Was told it would be about 15 minutes but was seated in about 5. Was given a table for 4 with a party of 5. Don't know about everyone  else but the table gets very crowded with 5 people sitting at a table for 4 with a  5th person at the end. Can't move at all no room for your food. Asked about a differant table and was told we'd have to wait 25 minutes .., really? We told you half hour in advance we had a party of 5. Was not happy this time around."}
{"text":"They made a lot of mistakes with our food order and they put music super loud that you practically have to scream to talk with your group on the table. Ordered 4 catfish and they only give 3. Ordered steak with shrimps and they give the steak without the shrimps. Ordered side of corn and no corn. Ordered plain steak without any topping and the steak comw out with mushrooms topping. Ordered sweet tea and I end up have to put sugars myself. The service super suck and they make a lot of mistakes on all of our orders. Maybe the servers are high on weed or something."}
{"text":"This place is busy, maybe that's why they don't cook with care. I order my steak medium and it came out raw. I had them recook it and when it came back to me a piece of my steak was cut off? By then all my side dishes were cold. My recook steak was no longer a medium, but a well done with no flavor or taste. I was disappoint didn't even finish my plate, such a waste."}
{"text":"The food & service is always good! Staff is very friendly & professional. Sirloin, new York& prime rib have all been equally delicious. Why I didn't give 5 stars is because the corn and green beans... corn taste like lemon juice was added and also the green beans were super salty.. aside from that everything was great!  ROLLS AND CINNAMON BUTTER= to die for."}
{"text":"Have always had good dining experiences here, friendly staff, good food and service. Just recently we had ordered take out. we had no idea where to go to pick up, as it was our first time. So, we went into the main entrance after seeing 3 smaller unmarked doors, thought emergency exits. We were told to go to the far end of the building and go into that door, which is fine, but annoying. It was annoying because the girl was annoyed telling us that, and because we were in a hurry and had to fight the crowd coming out to get in. Iasked the girl about the lack of signage and she had stated they bring it up all the time with managers but they don't care. It really is not that difficult to get vinyl lettering to say \"TO GO\" or \"TAKE OUT\". It isnt a huge deal but it is nice to have the clarity so first time pick up orders arent walking around confused and gettimg the run around. I think I am more irritated that staff have expressed that its an issue and has been blown off. Seriously....$40 fix, not that hard. Meanwhile at outback they bring it out to your car....too bad their food isn't as good. But I get take out from there more often simply so I dont have to drag out my baby and 2 year old out of the car."}
{"text":"Visited here for the first time.   We didn't know what to expect and I have to say we were very pleasantly surprised!!   We were seated within 10 minutes which was a bonus.      I ordered the 6 oz. filet and shrimp.    It came with two sides so I chose baked sweet potato and applesauce.      Besides the applesauce just being the stuff out of a jar and not homemade, everything else was great.  Steak was cooked perfectly.    Had great flavor.   Very tender.      Other 3 people in our group had great food also.      We all gave it a thumbs up and agreed we would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"PORK SOAKED VEGETABLES!  Now, I'm sure I know what you're thinking, don't eat at a steak house if you're vegetarian but I've done it many times over the years and been completely satisfied since other restaurants are honest about what's in their food. This joint has an item on the menu for vegetarians to pick 4 sides to create a meal, what they fail to mention is all their sides contain animal products.    They cook their baked and sweet potatoes in bacon fat, their mashed potatoes and rice contain chicken broth, even their green beans have pieces of pork in them.  To offer a entrée of four side dishes for non-meat eaters is an awesome thing for a steakhouse to do, but to have all those sides contain meat is disgusting. If I hadn't inquired about the potatoes I would have never known until I was throwing up that evening from eating hidden meat products.   The ONLY reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because they were accommodating enough to microwave a potato for me. I ordered the salad without animal (wasn't washed), I asked for steamed veggies (raw) and fries (horrible choice but what can ya do?)   My boyfriend's steak was supposed to be medium rare, it was well done and no thicker than your finger. The 11 year old with us ordered medium well, hers was borderline raw.    Even the meat eaters in our group were unsatisfied. We will never be back!!!"}
{"text":"Awful. Awful. Awful. I have given this place numerous chances and will never visit again. Steak was cheap and atmosphere was like a carnival. Never again.."}
{"text":"As i was eating my rotisserie chicken, i looked down and noticed blood ooozing out! Yuck!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect with Texas Roadhouse. I've driven past many times over the last few years and it was always busy. My friends wanted to meet up with our lady friends one Friday night so we thought lets have a rodeo at TR.  We called in ahead of time, it's not a reservation but basically like waiting in line, only your not there waiting. Our table was ready by 6:03, just as planned. We all (6 people) ordered different drinks, margaritas, some other tooty fruity drinks and I had a Blue  Moon with an Orange. Drinks were all good, they then delivered dinner rolls with cinnamon flavored butter, YUM!  We ordered different entrees, fall off the bone ribs, haddock, prime rib, NY strip steak 12 oz, smothered chicken and another steak.    I had the 12 oz NY strip steak, This one was a tough call. I'll tell you why, I've never had steak in a restaurant before so this was a daunting experience. I ordered mine the way I grill mine (medium well). It came out more well done. I thought whatever. The quality of the steak meat wasn't what I expected. However I remembered this isn't exactly the Tornado Room either. I'd go back, however I wouldn't get the steak. Everyone else enjoyed their food which maybe leads me to believe I'm just picky about my steaks. Who knows?"}
{"text":"My husband and I always have such a great time eating here- the servers are so friendly and the service is fast... Not to mention the yummy margaritas!!"}
{"text":"We had a horrible time at this place! We waited an hour to eat, after that hour we got terrible service and my good sucked. I ordered well done steak it was pink sent it back and it came back as rubber. They put the same steak on the grill and it was gross. We complained to the manager who could careless. We will never eat there again!!"}
{"text":"They definitely know how to cook that meat. But just like any steakhouse this one is nothin' special. It's poorly lit, cluttered with Texas ephemera and peanut shells. Good place to take those relatives you only kinda like."}
{"text":"We came to Surprise Az to start making arrangement for the move.  We have  been to Texas Road House several times in the Chicagoland area.  NOTHING LIKE THIS.  We had a server named Kylie, and the service was excellent.  We did not have to ask or wait for anything.  The appetizers, chili, main entry, refills ,  water or more buns etc.  ever needed to call her she was there.  Like I said excellent service.  The restaurant was clean and tidy everyone was friendly.  The steaks and meals were cooked to perfection.  The early bird special were told to us and that there was a prime rib special on Tuesday.  All priced great.  You must tryout this place."}
{"text":"I used the yelp app to check in at this location unfortunately according to the hostess they do not use the yelp app. There was not much of a wait so we decided to stay. The waitress was super nice and the food was great. Just disappointed its advertised as somewhere you can check in and then upon arrival told something different."}
{"text":"Arrived for a birthday dinner for our daughter.  Table of 9 of us.   Over a 2 hour wait limit when we were told it would be 45 minutes when arriving at 5:30pm. (on a Friday of course)   Host were very rude and unprofessional. Young girls need to learn some manners. Manager at the front was apologetic and seemed sincere. Did comp appetizers for the trouble.   When we were finally seated the rest of the evening was great.   Our server was on point and the food came was really good. Even embarrassed my kiddo for us and provided her with a birthday dessert."}
{"text":"My uncle loves this place and gave me and my husband gift cards for here so we decided to try it out. We tried once on a weekday night but the place was WAY too packed and had a huge wait- so we didn't stay. We went back early on the weekend for lunch and it was better. The staff were very welcoming and friendly and our waitress took the time to explain a lot to us. She was great. The rolls were delish. We got the lunch deals- the steak and chicken fried steak. The food was brilliantly cooked and on point. The mashed potatoes were good. The salad was fresh and crisp. And the steak fries were tasty. No complaints whatsoever- and if you know me then you know thats pretty good! We had enough to take half of each of our meals home. I am happy we tried this place out. They were great... and I am not a huge steak house person. I would come back for sure. But not if it is crazy crowded because that's just not me. Thanks Uncle Russ! :D"}
{"text":"Ok, first and foremost, we are are not CHAIN restaurant people. It's 8pm on a Sunday, my girl wants a steak, so here we are.  Super busy, immediately got a bad feeling right away. BOY.....we were wrong.  Devon our server, was outstanding, friendly and attentive. He was like a little puppy just aiming to please. THIS IS TEXTBOOK FOR GREAT SERVICE THIS KID. The rolls were from heaven my wife says, I got one bite out of 3 rolls.  I had the bone in ribeye and my wife had the small ribeye. Even the house salads were great, I ordered another one after my steak!! This is one chain, I'll gladly come back too.  THANK YOU DEVON!!!!"}
{"text":"We are huge fans of Texas Roadhouse but very disappointed with multiple experiences at this location. We became regular customers at the Power Rd location but recently moved and are now closer to Stapley. Tonight was our last visit there as we were disappointed with the service and food quality. We sent back two of our three meals (one was lukewarm, the other was incorrect). The server unapologetically took them back, brought back the corrected plate, and a manager brought out the re-heated steak kabob plate that was lukewarm. The server or manager never rechecked to see if everything was improved and in fact, the server seemed to do everything she could from then on to avoid our table (stopped bringing refills, didn't offer more bread, etc as she was before). Our bill was completely full price, not even the $5 appetizer comped for the poor experience. When I asked for a to-go cup (they usually offer one when a refill had recently been brought to the table) the server brought a used styrophome cup to the table (it looked like it had been used for something and then poured out, completely obviously used for something). I have spent many years as a head server at Outback Steakhouse who has very high standards to customer service which is probably why I expect at least decent service for a $70 steak dinner. To top it off, the server's name tag says \"Legendary Trainer\"... it is no wonder this location has such poor service if that is the standard that trains new employees.   Will make the drive to the Power Rd. Location from now on or another restaurant before trying this location again."}
{"text":"Just heading home and decided to swing in with the wifey and kids.I tell ya the salad the drinks and even my roadkill burger kicked ass!Inside is a lotta fun , peanuts , bread to start your meal with , can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Whenever we I eat at the restaurant food and service is always Great .We get a lot of take out which has Been kind of hit miss lately the proportions aren't the same and the food quality is not the same."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying I LOVE Texas Roadhouse. But this location was... awful, it was so awful. I'll tell you why, and no, we won't be coming back to this location.  We were seated immediately after calling ahead. We arrived to our table, weren't given any plates for the bread, so my Husband, myself and our kids were using the table for plates. one basket of bread was close to burnt. We were never asked if we wanted more.  Our bucket of peanuts were sitting on an extra chair next to the table, instead of on the table. Had to get it ourselves and who knows whose butt has been on that chair.   2 of 5 drinks were messed up. Salad arrived before our silverware. My Husband's fork had a bent spoke, we already had enough at this point and asked for the manager. She apologized, took our bent fork and had to bring us more silverware.  Rest of the food came. My Husband was missing his ribs off his plate and my steak was over cooked. I was seriously fed up at this point. But I was hungry and needed to eat so I sent it back for something edible in return. It took over 15 minutes for a replacement (it was cooked to perfection). Another manager came to ask if the steak was better, I told her it was so much better. But dang I waited a long time for it and by the time it arrived my family was almost finished with their food.  After all the mess ups and complaints, we received our check, nothing was compensated for our horrible dining experience.   I've never asked for a discount for food but this time the experience was so bad, no way was I paying for this disaster. After I told the waitress that I was shocked nothing was compensated,  she went back and talked to the manager. Apparently one was going to take my meal off but didn't (forgot I guess) and the other manager tried giving me $4.50 off (whoo hoo! Sarcasm)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. The food is great and the prices are decent. The only thing i really hate is the long wait times. The hostess always say 20-25 minutes and like last week we were there for 1 hour and 15 minutes until we said enough is enough seat us now. Even when you do call ahead seating you still wait 30-45 minutes. I love the place so I suffer."}
{"text":"I love Texas Roadhouse, and this one is no exception. Great service, food is excellent, and as a little tip for these cool nights, the tables outside are fair game with no wait!"}
{"text":"First experience here was not good, maybe an off night. The staff here genuinely care about their customers as I was contacted within a few days of that visit and review. In a city where there are restaurants on every corner, this matters, and makes their five star rating well earned.  I LOVE Texas Roadhouse. The chili is amazing, some of the best filets, who doesn't like bread with cinnamon sugar butter?! Downside of moving, we don't have one up in Flagstaff, so this is a must stop once a month when I am in Phoenix. Location is close to my Phoenix office, and walking distance from my preferred hotel in the area. Service was good, steak was prepared as ordered and fast (under 10 minutes from ordering to the table), and the tv's everywhere around the bar ensured I did not miss Monday Night Football. Jordan was great, made sure my sweet tea was full and even brought me one to go at the end of my meal. All in all a great experience, I will be back again and again and again."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for over 10 years and love it every time I go. From the nuts to the steak, I'm happy! I usually order the same things all the time, I have tried most everything on the menu and haven't found anything I'll spit out! It always crowded so get there between 4-5 p.m. or have a seat after that and chew on some peanuts while you wait for a table. It's a good place for the picky eaters and kids, or if you like your salads they have those too. If you don't like noise and have an issue with stepping on peanut shells STAY HOME!   Feel free to make sure they cook your steak perfectly I have had it happen to me a few times....*new cook*  equals raw steak YUCK! No mooing steaks for me please. Send it back til they get it right or don't pay for it!  Anyways, enjoy have a good time and be relaxed when you go and you'll be fine!"}
{"text":"I hate to use computer lingo but OMG !!  We had a blast.  Food was great. Server was great.  And so close and convenient to home.  And, as every employee walked by, we were greeted and asked if we needed anything.  As for the noise, well, that's the charm !  It's a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is a great value. Big portions that you can actually split and share to save money and still be full. Unlimited peanuts and bread rolls. My only negative is that I always have to send my steak and or prime rib back because its never prepared as requested."}
{"text":"Decided to give this location another try a several times after my last post. I can honestly say that I am truly done with this location. I still like Texas Roadhouse I just won't be visiting this location again. The \"Owner\" Kerry is a prick and does not care about his customers. During our last visit which was late March 2016 my wife started choking and vomiting while eating her prime rib. We did our best not to make a scene as we didn't want to gross the other patrons out. My son even almost vomited (normal reaction when you see someone else vomit). We didn't mention anything to anyone other than the server that the peanuts container needed to be discarded because of my wife vomiting in it. Afterwards, we took my wife to the ER because some of the meat was still lodged in her esophagus. Basically, she could still breathe and function but she couldn't drink or hold anything down as there was the blockage. Our family friend when she found out called Texas Roadhouse and explained to the \"owner\" what had happened and that since my wife and I were loyal customers as we go to Texas Roadhouse at least once a month if not twice a month for dinner passing up several streak houses along the way that it would be nice if Texas Roadhouse comped a meal for us. Keep in mind I did not know or expect that my friend called the restaurant on our behalf. She simply texted me and told me she called the owner Kerry and he wanted us to call him when she my wife was okay. Well my wife was stable and in the care of the ER department so I decided to call the owner Kerry. After waiting over 10 minutes on hold he finally gets on the phone and I tell him who I was. I told him that I was calling him because my friend had said that he asked us to call. While I was talking to Kerry I could not believe how uncaring and how such a prick he was. He said how is it his (Texas Roadhouse) responsibility for what happened. I told him we weren't looking for a hand out (complimentary meal) that I was simply calling him back per his request. I explained to him and out of respect of other customers we kept the commotion down as to not gross out the other nearby customers. Kerry was such a prick and not empathetic at all. His attitude over the phone came across that he didn't care and that I was simply bothering him. So now it is my mission that others know how the owner at this location does not care about his customers. This location is the not best at customer service anyways at least not consistently. We simply over all of our visits since this location opened chose to ignore the poor customer service, routinely having to send our meat back to be cooked the way we asked for it to be the first time. We still chose to give our business despite Black Angus having much better tasting steak and Long Horns both located next door having much better customer service. I sent an email regarding my complaint and the general manager called me back and left a voicemail asking me to call him back but I didn't bother because I am done with this location. After posting my experience on social media I will be letting corporate know as well."}
{"text":"So we sit down and our server says, \"hi I'm Shelly Mac and I'll be taking care of you tonight...\" and then something to the effect of \"and you're gonna have a great meal because I'm the best\".   Settin' some pretty lofty expectations...    Well, she was not bs'ing... she's legitimately the best... not just at this Texas Roadhouse or even the chain... she may literally be the best at what she does universally.  She's the nexus of energy, hospitality (like Mom makes you feel) and entertainment (she's the person you wanna hang with in Vegas).  Ridiculously great service aside,  the rest of the experience was solid.   Pork Chops were nicely done.  Ribs were literally falling off the bone.    Drinks (margarita & Kenny's cooler) were decent but a bit sweet (though what should I expect when I order a blue cocktail?).  It's been a while since we hit a Texas Roadhouse.   I almost forgot what a great place it is for a casual dinner.  There was one slight oddity this evening.  For one reason or another, there was an awkward, sullen young lady (looked at least a few years too old to be a Girl Scout).  drifting thru the restaurant carrying a vendor box (you know, like how they sell cookies and popcorn at a ballgame?) full of Girl Scout cookies that read only \"We Accept Visa / MasterCard\" across the front.   It had a pink fun noodle around the strap (ostensibly to provide some padding for her neck).     It is that time of year and obviously she was there to sell cookies, but all she did was walk around aisles of the restaurant - not a word, a smile, or even eye contact.  Basically, a Zombie.   After the fifth time she passed by, it was kinda creepy.   This went on the whole hour we were there.   She must have floated by like 15 times.    Then, as we left, what I think was her partner was sitting outside in the bed of a truck right outside the door.   At least he was selling as you might expect...    It clearly wasn't a restaurant-supported charity thing (not a mention from staff).  It's like the management just them set up shop.   Just odd."}
{"text":"This place is fine if you just need somewhere to keep the kids entertained for an hour.  It's a slightly above average chain that keeps a good mix of reheating frozen foods and presenting decent steaks.  We found their booths towards the south windows to be entirely too small for an average size family of four wearing jackets.  Add to the table the public feces peanut bin, and the peanut shell/garbage pail, plus bread and bread plates and there's no room to function.  Our latest server was pleasant, good with refills and didn't hesitate to grab the balloon making man for our children.  Their margarita was served entirely too cold and it took forever to thaw. The food is average and what you'd expect of Roadhouse, no problems and everything was to our liking.  Their bread rolls are sweet buttered and addictive.  The facilities were clean and we didn't have to wait for a table, as many after us did."}
{"text":"This place is so hit and miss on Service, Food Quality, and Overall Jackassery management policies that I almost left a 1 star rating.   Management policies : if you are in a \"group\" and even 1 person is \"late\", that despite the rest of the group wanting to sit down, order appetizers, get talking and looking at the main menu you will be flat out told \"NO, sorry you can't be seated until your entire party is present\", despite 5 out of the 6 being there and wanting appetizers. No exceptions. This can mean the reservation you made being struck from their book and your table/seating given to someone else. Management does not like special orders they deem \"unsafe\" (such as an extra rare or Bleu steak) even if the person (myself) has Eosinophilic Esophagitis which can make eating and swallowing a rare steak unsafe. Food can actually become lodged in my Esophagus causing choking. This is the REASON the steak was requested to be cooked as I asked.   You might get hot food, overcooked food (oh those poor sides that have been residing under the heat lamps too long) or even better NO food or missing dishes. Some servers are great, others act like you've hauled a huge chunk of cactus in and asked them to sit on it. The great servers are just that, GREAT! Hope you get one. The place is extremely loud and if conversation is a planned part of your meal kiss that goodbye. Also, hailing down a Server to find out why only 1/2 your order is there is quite a feat to itself. I advise tripping one, that will get their attention.   This review gets 2 stars instead of 1 for one reason only. The choice of sides includes one of the best dinner side salads I've ever repeatedly received. It's a wonderful mix of ingredients served in a chilled bowl. I'm mainly vegetarian, but do need to occasionally eat meat due to anemia, and these salads are worth a whole Star unto themselves. Pretty sad for a review of a restaurant that regularly has 30 - 45 minute wait times.   If you are looking for a place to celebrate a birthday, they'll do a cute little some and dance for you. Just hope that the food is having a good day along with your server."}
{"text":"This is a review for the bar. The food is always decent, but the service at the bar honestly goes beyond that. This place is an absolute zoo on the weekends, but the service always seems to be spot on at the bar. Shanda (sp?) is totally on top of it and super friendly. It isn't often you can go in a restaurant and get the same quality service on a Saturday night you would receive on a slow night- but they totally pull it off here. Kudos."}
{"text":"Well Done Steak, Loaded Mashed Potatos, Corn and Shrimp Skewer!  Always a pleasure to eat here! Great food, great price and atmosphere.  However, the staff? Very immature. Their side comments that they have about their customers are very unprofessional and rude."}
{"text":"Ive been to Texass Roadhouse numerous times now and have really not been impressed. The rolls are good but I personally think that Logans Roadhouse has better ones (Logans are always soft and never overbaked, Texas's have been the last few times). Am I the only one that has noticed though that almost everything is wayyyy too salty? Every time I order fries here, they are doused in salt. The husband got the chicken fried sirloin last night with fries and both were super salty. The green beans have boatloads of salt too. Additionally, the ranch dressing tastes like crappy bottled Kraft dressing. One final thing that was a no go for me is that their fresh steamed vegis were terrible. Last night, their broccoli was not trimmed enough the ends of it were very hard and fibrous and the carrots were not cooked enough so they were still hard. Booooo. I am not a fan of vegis as it is but when eaten this way, I really despise them. Now what has been good is their chili although it is a bit rich. Its very meaty so if I ever have to go here (with a group of people, I wont come here on my own), I would just get a bowl of this and have some rolls. The husband also says that the ribs are great. They are always fall of the bone tender. Aside from that, we are unimpressed with everything else. One other thing is that their portions are fairly large. However, the food, as mentioned is kinda crappy so if you like eating lots of crappy uninspired food, this is your place. I have nothing against chain restaurants but this is one of those that I don't get what the hype is about (see my list of overhyped places). This place is always busy and the wait is at least an hour each time I have been to this location. They don't take reservations or call ahead. I would advise to try Logans instead. Not only do they have better rolls but their menu is better and has more selections. Logan's food is always better as well and they have sweet potato fries which is one of my weaknesses. Also, their wait is never bad. Sorry Texass but in my opinion, you kinda suck.  PS: If you hate kids, DO NOT COME HERE. They are everywhere! The staff also seems to have a hard time accommodating large groups and there is not enough space in the area where they pile the large groups. You literally cannot move and the waiters have a hard time getting around the tables."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday night. My gf and I had just worked 12 hours shifts and wanted a decent dinner. We order, the food comes out and my gf's steak is undercooked. The server offered a new steak or to re-cool it. My gf asked for a new steak. A couple of minutes go by and the manager on duty brings the steak out and waits to make sure that it's satisfactory. It wasn't. They had re-cooked the original steak even though we were offered a new one. We point out that fact but the manager feels more like arguing with us about policy instead. Being as I am in a very customer service oriented industry, I understand that policy is policy but I also know where to draw the line and just take care of the customer. This manager clearly did not. She made my gf cry because of the stress of the long day and the situation.  I can honestly say this is the WORST Texas Roadhouse I've ever been to and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Went out to try this place with friends and was very disappointed. 3 people ordered 3 different steaks and all 3 came out cooked incorrectly. 1 was almost raw & the other 2 were way over cooked and cold. The side of a sweet potato cake out hard as a rock - they brought a new one to the table with the SAME exact problem. Inedible. The manager even came over and argued that the steak was sent overcooked. They ended up comping the steaks but definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Just opened this past week. The food and service was awesome. The filet steak was perfectly cooked and no knife needed!  The wait was a little long but it was well worth it. Highly recommend this new location.   Coryn, our server was efficient, friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I'm out here on business and have eaten here a few times since it's so close to my hotel.  If you're alone or with another person sit at the bar.  My service experience has been great every time.  The steaks are super tender and flavorful.  My recommendation is the roasted chicken.  It tastes incredible.  The seasoning is spot on and the meat falls off the bone.  I have no idea why it's so good.    I'm not sure why it's rated at four dollar signs.  It's not an expensive place to eat."}
{"text":"The food was very good , the waitress cute and efficient however the women's rest room was filthy as was the floor in the restaurant near there also dirty . Makes you wonder about the kitchen"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the 1/2 rack ribs and hubby had 8oz sirloin steak. Both were excellent. Servers were friendly and attentive. Place is loud and lively and always packed with customers."}
{"text":"I normally love Texas Roadhouse. I love the smothered chicken and roadkill Tonight was not one of those nights. Both my mother and I had problems with our medium rare roadkills. My mother and I both get no mushrooms due to stomach issues. My mother's came with just mushrooms. No cheese, no onions, etc., just mushrooms. Mine came OK, but instead of medium rare with a pink center, was well with an extra crispy outside and a grey center. It got taken back and my mother's came back fine. Mine came back later after 15 minutes of waiting and just munching on French Fries. When I asked the manager how it took that long I get the response of \"we needed to cook it\" meanwhile it takes maybe 8 minutes to cook one chopsteak to medium rare. There was little accountability which is greatly missed. My experience was horrible, enough to turn me off to this location. I'll gladly go to other Roadhouses because they are pretty damn good, just not this one."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a great place to bring the family and sit back, pig out, and have a beer or two. It has that bar feeling, very busy and fast paced. Since I'm a mom I don't get to go out a lot anymore, but this place gives you that feeling like you're at a bar but with the kids! I had the hurricane margarita and ribs. It was delicious! Great friendly service, and good food. Love it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a gift card to Texas Roadhouse. We went on a Monday afternoon and I got the $8.99 dinner special which included an entree and two sides. In my opinion, the amount of food for the price was worth it, but you're pretty much getting what your paying for. The quality and taste of the food was very mediocre. My sirloin steak tasted like the grill it was cooked on was dirty and my husband could of got a better tasting burger at In-N-Out. Keep in mind that my husband and I are not fans of chain restaurants, so if you like places like Chili's, Applebee's, etc. there's a solid chance you'll like Texas Roadhouse. One star for the restaurant, an extra star for our kind and helpful waitress. We will not be back."}
{"text":"ORIGINALLY POSTED TO MY OLD YELP ACCOUNT IN DECEMBER, 2011.   SINCE THAT POSTING WE HAVE ALSO BEEN TO THE ONE IN MURRIETA, CA, AND WE FOUND BOTH THE SAME GREAT SERVICE AND QUALITY FOOD AS WE FOUND AT THE PEORIA, AZ LOCATION.  We found this restaurant almost by accident, but I'll take accidents like this any day!  We drove to AZ specifically to eat at a restaurant that apparently closed down about three years ago.  Since there were was almost no place to park at this one, we decided to check it out.  When we first walked in and saw that they were crowded at not quite 5PM, we knew we'd hit  paydirt!  This place hand cuts their own meat, and they have a display counter showing patrons the meat.   While waiting for seating and then the meal, we munched on peanuts and could throw the shells on the floor (just like our own Northwoods Inn).  I ordered the 20 oz. bone-in ribeye, which comes with two sides.  Out if the several sides offered, I chose the green beans and the sweet potato.   My other half chose the catfish with the same sides.  My ribeye was cooked to perfection, and was very tender.  The green beans were full of bacon, just the way I like them.   The most pleasant surprise was the sweet potato.   It was baked with butter, cinnamon, brown sugar, and  lots of marshmallows--just as good as when I bake them at home!   Don's catfish was very good as well, according to him.  The staff was very courteous, professional, and helpful.  When our server, Jessica, found out that we had never been to a Texas Roadhouse before, she spent a lot of time explaining our menus choices to us.   The manager, Budd, also came over when he found out we were newbies, and gave us a coupon for a free appetizer at a later date.  All in all, a most pleasant dining experience.  There's only one complaint I have-- WE NEED ONE IN RANCHO CUCAMONGA!  (The closest one to us is in Murrieta)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in a few weeks ago and we left happier than ever. I have never written a review about an establishment, but this location blew me away! I love Texas Roadhouse, so when this one opened up my standards were pretty high. Our waitress was Sierra, she was absolutely amazing....to the point where I still remember her name and this was maybe 3 weeks ago and I have just now gotten around to writing a review because I have the most difficult time with yelp. However, Sierra made my boyfriend and I feel so welcomed and she seemed genuinely interested in how we were doing. She asked questions to get to know us and told us about herself. She made our visit so personable and we didn't just feel like another table. She joked around with us and made sure we were stocked up on the delicious butter and rolls...definitely a plus!  We also encountered Niko, who is the most down to earth guy I've come across. You'll know it's him when you hear his Irish accent, so I love to hear him tell me stories about his experiences! He has been all over surprise and never forgets a face! I see him everywhere and he always is so cheerful and such a hard worker. He creates such a fun energy anywhere he is...so Texas Roadhouse is lucky to have him!!   The food was your typical country style food. I got the smothered chicken with the sweet potato.....with the AMAZING BUTTER. The only thing that didn't  go as planned is we didn't get the green beans, but that's no big deal it was insanely busy and everyone is not perfect. Plus we were pretty full from the blooming onion and the rolls!   You'll definitely want to call ahead though, the line gets pretty long. We called ahead and bypassed the entire line and were seated within 5 minutes!"}
{"text":"Great Steaks and Good Service  What makes this place unique is the steaks.  It's like many other local Chain Steakhouses where you walk in the door and feel like you are in West Texas or at a NASCAR track.  In this case, it's both.  What sets them apart is the Steak.  You walk in the door and right across from the Hostess Station is a meat counter.  You can pick your own individual steak and they will cook it just the way you like it.  In my case, I picked a 16 oz Rib Eye that was almost an inch thick. I requested Medium Rare and I got Medium Rare. For a side, I had a cup of a very good Chili and Steak Fries.  Only problem I had was the Steak Fries came out half raw but when I brought it to the servers attention, she immediately brought another order and told me that if they were nor correct, I could substitute anyelse on the menu for that side.  Fortunately the replacement Steak Fries were perfect.  My wife ordered a Steakhouse Filet Salad with Blue Cheese Dressing substituted for the Italian.  She really enjoyed the salad and the protions were hugh.  Our server was very good and earned a good tip. Atmosphere is as I described,  Charlotte Motor Speedway meets Amarillo.  Stil, with all of the wood interior, it's a very warm and comfortable feeling."}
{"text":"Ok, to be honest I shouldn't have had very high expectations coming into the place, but I was hungry, it was late(ish), and they were open. The service was fine, but I can get that at McDonalds. What I came for was a steak. I ordered a rib eye, blackened, medium rare. What I got was blackened all right, but not how it is normally prepared. Blackened steaks are seasoned, then seared to order. This steak was basically Pittsburgh style, charred to a crisp, and raw in the middle. I actually like Pittsburgh style steaks, but this was over the top. Like eating a raw steak coated with charcoal.  Stick with the basics here and you'll probably be just underwhelmed instead of utterly disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent server, Marlene. Food is great . Lots of noise because very full . Definitely worth it . And again Marlene was awesome"}
{"text":"As far as chains go, Texas Roadhouse is one of my favorites. Peanuts on the floor, loud music, live people, cold beer, and fried pickles.  This was a planned visit during my baseball/NASCAR weekend so we stopped in here after the baseball game. We started with the fried pickles (as I always do) and a cold Budweiser (as I always do).  Really having a good time here: Celebrating my Padres winning their ST game, watching my Tar Heels win the ACC tourney, watching the waiter-waitresses dance, and converting one young lady from being a Jeff Gordon fan to a Kevin Harvick fan.  Oh....the food. Well, I had the pulled pork which was delicious (as always) and the wife had the country fried steak. I tried hers and it was one of the better ones I've had in years anywhere.   I think you really have to be a fan of this kind of establishment to really enjoy it. If your'e a \"foodie\" then you probably don't like chains anyway so this might not be you're cup of tea.  If you're redneck like me, you'll love it."}
{"text":"My mother and I were visiting from boston and went  out for lunch with our family hich consisted of my grandparents,uncle,aunt and cousin. We walked in and immediately the hostess brought us to 2 seperate tables. I being in the food and beverage business suggested putting them tables together and was reprimanded by an extremely rude server who should have gone to the manager if there was a problem. We decided to leave and take our business elsewhere to smokey bones in mentor ohio which was a much better experience! Neither I or myself will go back to that establishment due to how awful we were treated. I thought my experience should be shared with others because of how awful our experience was."}
{"text":"Sometimes a long Waite. But it's a good place to dine.  Haven't had a bad experience yet.  Staff is always fun and attentive. Great atmosphere. Steaks are always awesome."}

{"text":"Texas Roadhouse used to be my favorite restaurant. The apps were great, the salads great, my steak was always done to perfection and service was top notch. At least at the metro center & arrowhead locations.  This one opened up close to our house so I was very excited. However, 4 times we've been here: I've had to send my steak back 3x. Twice the seasoning on the steak was overdone (too salty). Service has been meh at best. Once, our potato skins didn't arrive until after our main meal. On that same visit, they weren't even on the check at the end so I thought ok cool they took them off because they were late. I give them my CC, and the receipt comes back higher. Waitress said she had forgotten them on the original bill. Sigh...  Whoever is running this place needs to take a hint from other locations. I liked Texas Roadhouse because they were consistent and I always knew what I was getting. This location is a crap shoot.   My wife & I plan on making the extra drive to the arrowhead or metro center location so we can get what we have always expected."}
{"text":"Oh the taste of Texas! What a great feeling and experience I had on my last trip to Texas Roadhouse. I stopped in a few days ago with a friend who had never been there before. It's been years since I had been in. Matter of fact the times I ate there I always chose a poultry and vegetable entree as I did not eat beef. This time I decided to experience something new.  The moment we walked in around 5pm we were greeted and seated with some warm fresh bread. Our drink orders were immediately taken. My friend decided to try the Sangria Margarita with an upgraded double shot. I settled for water. Looking through the menu we did the two person dinner for $42.00. This included an appetizer which we ordered the onion blossom. It still has not changed. Very tasty. I ended up getting a rib eye now that I beef sometimes. Along with a sweet potato and buttery corn. My friend ordered the Shrimp and Sirloin with green beans and a loaded potato. I was highly impressed with the taste of all items. The fact that they cut there meat there fresh and serve us our food in a timely matter we were very pleased.  Observing the service at other tables I have to say everyone was please. Great service from all staff who even had a chance to line dance. The manager made my friends day by giving her a bag of peanuts to go along with a free appetizer for her next visit since it was her first time there. We will be back again."}
{"text":"This was my brother's choice for dinner while we were visiting Arizona! I've always wanted to try one and am so glad we did!!   We took a short drive to the restaurant had a short wait for a table. Our server was Jessie and she was very friendly and informative! We told her it was our first time here and she gave us a quick rundown of the menu.   Checking in on Yelp! offers a free appetizer and we got the blooming cactus blossom. It was a great presentation and we ate most of it.   We ended up getting some steaks and sides and really enjoyed our meals. On Wednesday's they have a sirloin special for $10.99 which was cool! My brother and I got ribeyes. The meat was cooked very well and so tender. My only small complaint is that my piece seemed a little heavy handed with the salt. My brother's piece was perfect!!   My favorite part about this place is their rolls!!! I don't even know what they put on them, but W O W. They come out hot and fresh along with a cinnamon butter!! It is seriously addicting!   We will probably be back to this franchise again! We had a great experience!   *if you have a sensitive peanut allergy, be cautious as there are peanut shells everywhere!*"}
{"text":"Omg I will never go to this location ever. We arrived at about 930p on Friday night. It took about 30 mins or more for our food to come out. When it came out, it was cold steak. The chicken was dry and covered in BBQ sauce. The baked potato was under cooked and the butter, cheese, and sour cream didn't melt. We asked for a manage it took him forever to come out. Then he said they turned off the equipment to heat the food. He gave us coupons, but then brought us the bill and charged us full price for food we didn't eat. Finally, another manager came out out took the food off of the bill. The process was over 30 plus mins."}
{"text":"Steaks aren't cooked as you've requested them to be.. Slow to get your food.. The place has changed.."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for many years but I may have to think it over and go to another location. My friend and I got there exactly at 4 PM  there was a long line of people already the manager and another employee were standing there where you check in and they were talking and  doing something on the computer but they didn't tell any of us what was going on or apologize for the delay. We stood there for 10 minutes before they started seating people. We sat in the section closest to the entrance because it is quieter, other section, the music is too loud. We both ordered the prime rib for the first time, the other steaks are good so thought prime rib would be also. Well we were wrong. It had no taste and didn't have a good crust on the outside. My friend's was the same, no taste or flavor. Very disappointed. I asked for extra butter for my baked potato and that didn't come, but it's like this always. I can't forget this, there was a spilled drink on the floor and peanut shells in it. We had to step over it to sit down. Asked if someone could clean this mess up, the server took our bucket of peanuts, poured them on the liquid and kept smashing them with her feet. Said the shells would absorb the liquid, couldn't believe my eyes and nobody ever cleaned up this mess. I will try another location or the steak restaurant next door."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the food, but not the loud atmosphere. That keeps me away most of the time, but when I just want a decent steak with a sweet potato...you know where to find me.  Doesn't hurt that they serve drinks in a fishbowl either"}
{"text":"Dinner for 4. Everyone was happy for the most part. My salmon was a little salty. Hubs steak was delish! Everything looked great and our waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Another attempt to eat at this location. Rolls were okay, but still doughy in center, same as previous visit.  Received our Caesar salads once again with mayyyybe only one leaf with very little dressing.  My husband received one crouton, while I received two.  My side of chili was brought at the same time, in a plastic to go dish, got cold immediately.  They were out of dishes per the server.  Mind you this was between lunch and dinner and the place was probably half full.  Not sure what was happening, but we chose not to continue with the meal afraid this would continue. We immediately notified the staff that did try to rectify by offering to bring it out again, but we politely declined."}
{"text":"Came to this location last night for dinner. It was my first time ever coming to a Texas Roadhouse and will certainly not be my last. Right from the start the service was amazing. Hostess was very friendly and polite. Took the liberty of telling me her favorite dishes and recommendations   since I had never been a Texas Roadhouse before. Our server, Jett was flawless in every way. Very polite and friendly and always super fast as well as attentive, even though it was peak dinner time and he had a full section. The food was spectacular. Had the cactus onion as an appetizer and the country fried sirloin with loaded mashed potatoes and green beans as my entree. I've worked in restaurants for five years and now manage an establishment and can say in my professional opinion this restaurant is run to 100% quality from the staff to the food and drinks. It was an amazing experience and will definitely be back very very soon. Most credit going to Jett. Management should feel as lucky to have him on their staff as I was to have him as a server."}
{"text":"I called to order take out on a Friday night like I have done for the past couple months.  I was on hold 17 minutes before I was able to give my order. I drove from Buckeye still on hold. Normally phone linr is good. But I love the bartender."}
{"text":"The food and service was great for the money. Downfall my husband was sitting off the side of a vent and had dust and debris all over his shirt. The bathrooms had a sewage odor."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night.  I ordered the Ceasar salad. it was not good. The lettuce was white and yellow, it tasted sour. I pushed it aside, my husband had the house salad, he said it was ok. (Not good - just ok)  The server asked how our salads were and I explained mine wasn't very good.  She took our plates and walked off, didn't say anything!! *not even sorry*  The bread/rolls were dry and stale, they didn't even give us any butter for them. The food came, I had country fried steak, and husband had sirloin. this part of food was ok (not good - just ok) Husband had to ask twice for refills on his drink, then the server vanished. We had to ask another server for our check. Then our server came back with it, the folder had smeared butter on it!  GROSS!!!   We were not happy with the service, or the food."}
{"text":"Went out to dinner tonight with my husband. I ordered steak tips over rice, no gravy, well done.   What I received was SMOTHERED in gravy and the steak tips were raw ! HATED IT.  Waitress came around to take our order and to give us a bill. THAT IS IT."}
{"text":"Busy, but seated quickly. Unfortunately that was the only good thing. Took over an hour for food to arrive and it was not hot- tepid at best. Waitress was absent. Dropped off salads and left. But we couldn't eat the salads because we were not given silverware. Had to wait for server to finally come back and she made a snarky comment that the hostess should have given us silverware. Finally dropped off entrees after an hour and left. Didn't come to check on us or the food or get drink refills. Hungry so ate a bit of the food. She came back with the check, which had items we ordered but didn't receive. Had to have her correct the bill and tell her she would have known about this and the food temperature if she had come to check on us. Paid over $60 for food we boxed up to bring home and will give to our dogs."}
{"text":"I usually don't write negative reviews, but I'd be doing everyone a disservice if I didn't share my experience here:  ONE AND HALF HOURS from the time we checked in with the greeter, to the time the salads were brought to our table. And this was on a Sunday night.  When the steaks arrived finally, one was over cooked (medium was well done), and my children's medium steak was raw (not rare, but raw). And they completely forgot their side orders. For the first time in my life, I sent food back. It was simply unsafe to eat. They shared my steak with me, because after waiting an hour-and-half, we couldn't possibly wait another 30 minutes for them to correct their mistake.  Javier, our waiter, was no where to be found for long periods of time. Twice we needed drink refills, and after waiting for long periods of time, I asked another waiter/waitress to kindly find him...  Although I spoke to the manager and he apologized, the damage was done. Never again will I subject my kids or myself to such poor, careless service again! Way to go ruining a birthday dinner, Texas Roadhouse! Thanks for nothing! I'll spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place every time we go it's a great experience. The only drawback is that they only open late on week days but that's no biggie. Our service today was on point the food was delicious as always! My husband and always get an appetizer, this time it was the chili cheese fries, and share a full rack of bbq ribs. We normally share a baked potato and side salad but this time we got steamed veggies and rice which was also very good."}
{"text":"By far the worst service.  Server actually asked us to clear our dishes. When we ordered, the waiter evaluated our selections.  Very dissappointed"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and had a great meal and good service. However, the last time I was here the food was not prepared to temp, the service absolutly was aweful. I brough friends to dinner. One friends steak was supposed to be Med-Well, the damn thing was still mooing. The waitress did not come check on us for 20 minutes after our food was delivered. She told my friend to be a big boy and eat up they didn't have doggy bags. Then she walked away.  He was very disapointed and got up and walked out. I had to get another waiter to get the waitress for me. She said oh I though I was doing a good job. UM really how?  This experience has ruined it for me. I will not be back. I gave away my giftcards. Will not return."}
{"text":"Got a medium 16 oz ribeye with fresh vegetables and a baked poatato with everything on it. Good cut. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Went in here at 5:30p and there was no line - by the time we left, there was at least a 45 minute wait by 7p.  The food is good, a little to processed, but for people that eat this type of food all the time probably think it is A-ok.  A nice treat going here, but I would not go all the time.  The bread and butter is delicious.  The filet was ok - a little overcooked for me even when I requested medium rare.  The kid got mac and cheese and she liked it...good place for kids.  NOTE - 3 stars for food & 4 stars for atmosphere - but atmosphere wins out here (especially when the waitresses do their line dance)"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight after road tripping all around AZ.  No wait at 7:15, the girls at the front were lovely and sat us right away.  We had Derek as our server and he was great.  You sure couldn't tell the restaurant was winding down after a busy Sunday.  Derek was great - just the right amount of guidance, check ups, drink refills and enthusiasm.  He was great - we'll request him on our next visit.   Food was great as usual - ordered too much so we have leftovers for tomorrow.    Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I like the food. Waited 30 mins when we were told 15. When I asked how much longer, the hostess  was pretty rude about it. Waitress did not get our drink orders right and they placed 5 adults at a 4 person table. It was a holiday and they were very busy, but I was pretty disappointed. Food was good and the price is inexpensive for a steak. Steak was cooked correctly, I ordered mine medium."}
{"text":"My husband ordered a salad and I got the prime rib. Everything came out great and the service was excellent. Our server was Emily and it almost seemed like she knew what we needed before we even asked! Two thumbs up!  If there was any complaint about our visit, it would be that the coke delivered to the table was flat and tasted funny. However, as soon as I mentioned it Emily gladly switched it out for a sweet tea which tasted great.   Overall a great visit and we'll probably return again when we're back in town."}
{"text":"This was freaking fantastic!   My friend and I were in town visiting with family and just happened to be in the Metro Center area. We decided we felt like hitting a steakhouse and on the perimeter of the mall there were three in a row near I-17. Since this place was recommended by a co-worker of one of my family members, it won out. We checked Yelp! and noticed it had 3 1/2 stars, so my expectations were somewhat tempered, but we went ahead anyway.  What a pleasant surprise! We were immediately acknowledged by the host with a big smile and, even though the place was pretty busy, were immediately led to a booth.   Now it is loud in there, but we very much enjoyed the atmosphere! It was lively and festive..very upbeat! Our waitress came out and asked if it was our first visit and answered a ton of questions regarding menu items and hooked up our drinks right away. She was very personable and engaging. We were already impressed with the service level at this point and now were anxious to check out the food!  I ordered the 11 oz. sirloin steak with a caesar salad and mashed potatoes(14.99). The steak was so thick and juicy, cooked perfectly to the medium rare I love!   My friend ordered a large porterhouse T-Bone steak (24.99) which was huge! I was jealous! I'll have to grab that next time!  My other friend grabbed the \"Road Kill\" (14.99) (sounds appetizing, doesn't it? lol), which is a 10 oz. chop steak smothered with sautéed onions, sautéed mushrooms, and jack cheese. He was able to add a side of ribs and a bowl of chili to that as well.   It was fantastic how they staggered the dishes! First we had the salads and the chili. Shortly after finishing those dishes, out came the main dishes! It was just perfectly timed! Everybody at the table was raving about how great the food tasted!  All the while, the staff would announce when a member of the military was in the restaurant or when someone had a birthday! They would than lead the whole place into a Yee-Haw!! to celebrate! lol We got a kick out of it! It was fun! Than near the end of our meal the staff came out and did a whole sing-dance-line dance routine. We were really enjoying the atmosphere! I've read other reviewers complain about these things, and I say....shut the hell up! Its called TEXAS ROADHOUSE! What did you expect?? Miserable pricks...  On top of all that, as we were getting ready to leave, the manager approached us and acknowledged it was our first visit, thanked us, and presented us with a complimentary bag of peanuts. I know it was just a bag of peanuts, but I was really impressed! It was a class move and it just sealed the 5 star deal for me!  So to re-cap: Great service, great food, fun and festive atmosphere...all at an insanely affordable price! How can you lose??? Get down here and check this place out! You won't regret it!  5 stars."}
{"text":"Jack, hope you are listening!!!!! We have been coming here long before you took over the Texas Roadhouse in Peoria AZ. Since you have taken over there seems to be something missing as far as the personal touch and the appearance of the building in general, for example, the faucet in the men's room has been leaking for a few months now, the management staff has seemed to not be in touch with its employees. The whole place doesn't seem to gell like it used to. There are  some great people in place but, the rest of the staff don't seem to be on the same page. I don't want to put down the good people like Jessie, Tiki, Anna, Kim and Karly. There are a couple more that I did not mention. These people are all 5 stars but, the rest of the staff seems to have lost touch with the customer.  I could go on but, I think you should take a good look at your establishment. The.food seems to never come out on time and is wrong most of the time on how it is cooked. Today and for the last year or so I give you Jack a generous 3 star should be lower"}
{"text":"We went to dinner here on a Sunday evening. The line was longer than expected for a Sunday but it wasn't horrible. Your dinner starts with warm rolls that taste like they are made with a slightly sweetened dough. Cinnamon sugar butter is served alongside them. We ordered the baked salmon dish with a side of steamed vegetables. The salmon was cooked perfect with a slight crisp on the outside. We also ordered the T-bone steak and rib combo. You are given the option to add mushrooms and/or onions atop your steak.  I opted for both. I had a salad and sweet potato as my sides. The steak was juicy and ribs were tender.  The house salad was a fail. It will only anger you. The lettuce wasn't crisp and the rest of the salad was eggs, cheese, tomatoes, and croutons. Bland and boring. So aside from the sad salad the rest of the food was good. During dinner the wait staff performed a dance routine which was entertaining to watch."}
{"text":"Teresa was amazing! First time coming in and she was so helpful when it came to my food restrictions! We will definitely be coming back! Food and service was great!"}
{"text":"Their bread rolls with cinnamon butter are to die for! I've been comming to this location for 6+ years & have never experienced bad service."}
{"text":"I was very displeased with not only the food but the service. We ate there yesterday for dinner for the first time. My steak was 80 percent fat and had no flavor. I had to ask our server 4 times for refills. The wait times for our food and drinks was ridiculous. My son ended up choking on fatty meat and vomited all over his plate. We sta there for 10 minutes with throw up before our server even came over."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! We have been here 4 times for the Dallas Fillets and never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Come several times a month. Never fails us. We like sitting at the Bar (booths). Always same two waitresses They are Professionals. Fast. Friendly. Always checking.  Oh the food...... Roadhouse is Great on all. The 6oz is enough for me. Always perfectly done. Ribs have lots of meat. Get the loaded baked potato. Worth it. Salads always the freshest.  Lots of TVs in bar but not too loud. Just great place."}
{"text":"Most Roadhouses are the same. My daughter wanted to come here for her birthday so I did the call ahead when we were in our way. Dec. 9th. Ashley answered the phone and was very nice and accommodating. I actually feel bad that I don't remember the server's name because she was good and nice and efficient. She was older for a server with a short name, dark hair and in the top area booths.  The bidders stood in the middle of the ramp with their bus tubs when I was trying to get to our table and I had to tell them that that was not a god spot for them to stand and that they needed to move. I had my kid's dad order for me since they got there before me and they were trying to get to a game. I timed it just right that the food would arrive when I got there and it did. She walked up with the food just after I sat down. My medium rare steak was more medium well. She asked if they could remake it but I told her that we didn't have time for that but to let the managers know and to let the cooks know that they should be able to properly cook a steak. The bathrooms weren't too bad, but the rug in it moves and I almost fell when it slipped while I was walking.  On our way out, I let one of the MoDs know everything, and they were just like, \"thanks! Have a great night!\"  Seriously? Didn't even seem like they cared at all. I used to love Roadhouse, but will have to try the other steakhouses, it seems like they are letting the quality of their employees and restaurants lag"}
{"text":"Went on a fri night...they are the busiest here but with the call ahead seating we got a table right away.  We love Roadhouse... consistent food and service and the two of us and sometimes my kid and usually leave full with leftovers for about $35! And...fried pickles= YUM!!!"}
{"text":"The steak, shrimp, salad and sides we had were very good and the service was decent. Loved the rolls. However, although we liked the music, it was ridiculously loud making conversation nearly impossible. We will not return."}
{"text":"When this place opened, I would've given 5 stars but now it's just a gimmicky run of the mill steak house that can't cook steak properly and If you're like me, that's a no go. Each and every time my girlfriend and I go there we have to return our first steaks. Every... single... time. I secretly hope that the \"next\" time will be better but this last time was the same again. Even our waitress was disgusted with how bad the steaks were. Also, it just feels like a Chuck E Cheese anymore. Kids run rampant without supervision while every 15 minutes there's an anouncement that it's someone's birthday and a line-dance, stomping party follows afterward. Spare me the noise, the sodium and the atmosphere and teach your cooks how to cook."}
{"text":"Okay, not bad, not bad. Great fun restaurant with good menu, fun ambiance and good service. Been a TRH in Cleveland many times while working there on business. This is the firs time for me in the Pittsburgh area and specifically in Monroeville. This place opened not more than a month ago. In that time they have worked through most of the 'opening day' issues and troubles.  I used the 'call ahead seating' option and was seated within 5 minutes of arriving. That is good system management let's just say. We were seated in a booth in the bar area, which was just fine with us. Our server/waiter was very professional and cordial and prompt with his attention and service. We had three different stake selection all of which came out just a tad over done but very tasty nonetheless. The sides are 'kind-of' 'homestyle' but adequate accompaniment's to the main portion of the mean which is steak; which is why everybody is here.  The menu is quite varied and offer may choices from ribs, to burgers to many kinds of steaks. I think everybody could find something interesting to eat here. Everything is moderately priced and full of flavor.  Left well satiated and happy. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"We had a party of 10 and they were super accommodating on a busy Sunday evening. The hostesses and waitresses were super friendly and very attentive. It was my father-in-law's birthday and they came and sang and made him sit on a saddle.   All-around we had a very pleasurable experience and we must say that we have never been disappointed at any of their locations.  Texas roadhouse always seems to be well staffed and well-trained. That goes along way in adding to a pleasurable experience. We never went more than a few minutes without the waitress coming to our table asking us if we were okay or if we needed anything. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Do not go on Tuesdays. Apparently it was superhero night.  Was the worst service experience in a long time.  Waitress was more involved in a boyfriend who was at the table next to us than us. Music was over powering and food was just humdrum.  In general quality has gone down since opening."}
{"text":"I swear TRH was better than this. First of all how many hostesses do you need- there was 8 standing around doing nothing, I repeat 8. Food was so salty my lips are like pruned and chapped. But two words CHEESE FRIES-nom. Overall just so mediocre. Oh and if they ask me one more question I'm gunna go crazy. Constantly being bothered is far from \"good customer service\".  PS my friend absolutely loved her shrimp she doesn't eat it from \"anywhere else\""}
{"text":"Server was great! Filet was not done like I wanted it..  Waited long time for my food to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a great time here with my boyfriend it was his birthday dinner we got the chili cheese fries omg so good ^_^ also BBQ Chicken plus he got a steak he loved it! Great Service, Nice workers! But only thing one worker was watching the game on the bar don't get me wrong I'll all for that but he was being noise hearing us talk and kept looking over."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse has it all for sports fans and steak lovers! Great prices, service and quality food.   I've had both the chicken and filet salad and have to say the filet is phenomenal and the chicken was tender and flavorful.   The sirloin is a bargain with 2 sides for $10.00. Burgers and side salad are good as well.   Big secret: you can call ahead and reserve a table. This is necessary on busy nights."}
{"text":"The first one came out very salty and got exchange.The second steak cooked perfect and tasty, best bone in rib eye. The chef brought it out personally, very nice person. Thanks"}
{"text":"Great visit...they can handle busy days without sacrificing service or quality.....my  family stopped in on a Saturday at 4pm and they were really crowded so we ate at he bar and didn't have to wait...but I can see they were doing to best to get people in and out"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, and a good family restaurant. Not good at accommodating large groups, and the Ribs and steak fries were mediocre at best. Otherwise a good place to eat. Short wait for food and drinks, appetizers came within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Horrible service, horrible management., food mediocre...and watch out for their site specific rule of only 3 alcoholic beverages.  This is the only Texas Roadhouse with this rule...doesn't matter the size or strength of the drink..you only get three so drink slowly! Won't be back..."}
{"text":"This was just a disappointing and awful experience.  We have been to other Texas Roadhouses in other states, and none of them were operated like this. This store bought grocery store buns for the hamburgers! Not their usual handmade buns. They were slow with service. The food was awful. So bland and boring. Horrible burger. They do not employ enough bartenders to handle the bar and tables. And the bar is ridiculously small compared to others. You can't get a drink! What a disappointment. The only redeeming factor- the hostesses were very nice. But I would not waste your time eating here."}
{"text":"The steak shish kabob switched recipes and is now overcooked, tiny pieces of steak. Not to mention there is a three drink maximum! I have never been to a restaurant with such ridiculous restrictions. The service is excellent but the changes they have made will definitely keep us out of that Texas Roadhouse!"}
{"text":"This place is everything that's good and bad about America. It's a loud, excessive, over-the-top contributor to the nation's obesity epidemic. These are also some of the reasons that it's so damn popular. Using a sort of Texas meets commercial country/wild west theme, Texas Roadhouse is a decent place to get a good steak without having to take out a loan first.  We arrived around 5pm on a Sunday and the place was packed. People were spilling out of the waiting area and into the lobby, the hostess was doing her best to take names and pass out little electronic buzzing things, and the giant moose head hanging over the entrance looked on with cunning apathy. This place is not for those with a fear of loud noises and crowds. The decor is a combination of neon beer signs, steer horns, knotty pine planks, and cowboy. I was a tad unnerved by the giant mural of a Native American that took up most of the wall next to me. Disturbingly ironic.  We waited about 10 minutes before being ushered past the meat display case by the roll-carrying, black-shirted escort. The staff here is mostly female with an average age of about 19 and they're always moving. Unfortunately we got a two-top stuck right out in the middle of the floor. It had the same problems that all two-tops have in restaurants including lack of space (due mostly to the big metal pail of peanuts, salt and pepper shakers, menus, and steak sauce) and poor placement (I was constantly getting bumped into as servers whisked by to deliver food to the surrounding tables) but I was hungry and I was seated so I sucked it up.  The first of what would turn out to be three servers we'd have throughout our meal - apparently they've got a team approach to service - stopped by after a few minutes and took our drink order. Now for some notable highlights/lowlights:  Very limited beer selection - First, there's no Shiner Bock or Texas beer of any kind and the rest of the beer offering reads like a frat house mini fridge. Luckily they had the good ole Cleveland staple Dortumunder Gold and a surprisingly tasty Leinenkugel Snowdrift vanilla porter. Chilled mugs, ugh. Chilled mugs are for floats not beer. They also offer a \"short\" and \"Tall\" option. I went with the short and would highly doubt they were more than 10oz pours for which I was charged what most bars charge for a full pint. Anyway, I had low expectations on this front and they were met.  Good value-priced steaks - On par with the likes of Longhorn and Outback, the cow prices here are comfortably affordable and intended for the masses. I got a 12oz ribeye for $17 and it came with two sides. Not a bad deal considering I got dinner for the next day out of it, too. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, marked and seasoned well, and slathered in butter. The loaded baked potato and green beans did their best to stop my heart on the spot.  Alternatives for those into swine - If steak isn't your thing you can get ribs, chicken and even fried catfish. My wife opted for the pulled pork and it was pretty damn tasty. Not covered in sauce the meat was tender and juicy with just a hint of smoke. It definitely reminded me of the BBQ we grew to love when we lived in Texas.  The rolls, my God, the rolls - These things, which are available in a seemingly endless supply, are fantastic. They're yeasty, sweet, buttery carb grenades that come served with a sugary, cinnamon butter. Make sure you get a basket to take home with you. These things would be great as buns for pulled pork sliders.  It's loud and it's country - I personally can't stand country music of any kind so I had to go to my happy place while I was here.  It's blasting out of every crevice of the restaurant and there's no escaping it. Luckily the steak I was noshing on was there to take my mind off of the audible assault.  Manic, Ooompah Loompah staff - It felt like there were about a hundred staff members running around the place, their black t-shirts emblazoned with \"I Love My Job\" melting into smears down the narrow aisles. They talk very fast, walk around the tables in a constant hurry and recite their script-like pleasantries with pinpoint precision.  Not normally a fan of chains, Texas Roadhouse is a solid, middle-of-the-road steakhouse with good service, good steaks, and killer rolls. If you're part of the \"I Love This Bar\" crowd you'll feel like you just came home and if you're not you can grin and bear it for a well-cooked piece of meat and a damn good baked potato. You'll know you did it right when you can feel your already winter-pudged belly pressing against your belt and a slight sickening feeling washing over you. You've just been \"Roadhoused\".  P.S. You should check out the video on the Roadhouse website with founder Kent Taylor. He sort of reminds me of a combination of Dave Thomas and Ted Nugent."}
{"text":"We had wonderful service and our steaks were cooked perfectly! The staff was very attentive. We never went without anything. The restrooms were very clean and well stocked."}
{"text":"Ugh!!! Second time in a row they've screwed up my food!! Not only did it take FOREVER (on a Tuesday), but it was completely burned!! I always get the steak kabob no rice, extra grilled veggies and I'm used to them screwing up my side, BUT I ordered it medium and the meat and veggies were super well done. I sent it back, and my replacement came back after the rest of my family was finished with their food... no check discount, no visit from the manager, Nada. I asked the server if they don't typically do anything about burnt food and he said, \"we replaced your kabobs\"... ummm yeah, and I got to watch my family eat and get a box so that I can eat mine tomorrow... alone. Thanks for nothing!! P.s. the waiting area at this place is ridiculous. I mean really, ridiculous."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food. I had a burger, which was decently priced and fairly tasty. While this place was all right, it's definitely nothing to write home about. Maybe next time I'll try a steak and see how that is."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time about three weeks ago and it was great, the drinks and the prices! We went again this past weekend and it was excellent... The food and our waiter Ian was awesome. Very talkative and in a great mood the entire time and really gave us that welcoming feeling. Will be back!"}
{"text":"So my visit started out good but didn't end too well.  I ordered chicken fried chicken with white gravy and got chicken fried steak instead.  Then the waitress got an attitude with me and pretty much told me it was my fault for not saying it louder. My thoughts are if you didn't hear me then ask me to repeat it don't just put whatever you want. It really is that simple."}
{"text":"Three back to back to back sub-par experiences.  One visit they over cooked my \"medium\" steak twice.  The most recent visit two people in my party also had over cooked steaks and my sweet potato was burnt on the inside of the skin.  I'm not even sure how you burn the skin on the inside of the potato.  The one saving grace is the service is usually above average otherwise they would have gotten two stars.  I won't be back to this location for a while."}
{"text":"It was 5:40.  The wait was forty minutes and we weren't sure whether or not we should wait...  but, two words..  worth it.  The food was delicious and Justin couldn't have been a more attentive server.  Well done!!"}
{"text":"Delicious unlimited freshly baked rolls with honey cinnamon butter!!!    That is all the reason you need to go to this restaurant.  Just for the rolls and butter.  Plus you can peel peanuts and throw the shells on the floor, how fun is that!?  The service is good and the entrees are consistently pretty tasty.  The entrees are not culinary works of art, but this is a good place for a quick, casual steak."}
{"text":"From Las Vegas and each time we go to visit friends, My husband and I always manage to come and have dinner to this place. We enjoy it very well. The staff are very friendly. And food are awesome!"}
{"text":"I stopped at Texas Roadhouse for lunch yesterday. I ordered the 6oz sirloin steak lunch. The mashed potatoes were very good as well as the salad. The steak was average and cooked to my liking. The waiter was very attentive and helpful. Overall I had a pleasant experience especially for the price."}
{"text":"When I walked into Texas Roadhouse one of the first things I noticed was a deli style meat case to my right. They proudly the centerpiece. We were seated at a table of two, and the majority of the menu revlolved around steak items. I know literally nothing about steaks but our sassy waiter will sure did! My boyfriend wanted one steak which they were out of, Will (the waiter) suggested the rib-eye stating \"It's the same steak basically, just a different name.   Another cool touch were the bucket of peanuts. Shuck your peanuts from the bucket on the table as you wait and toss them on the floor. I ordered the ribs, with mashed potatoes, and baked beans. I wanted to try something for southern-American. While the baked beans were derived from a tomato base everything else was killer. A picture of my meal is in the gallery for this restaurant.  All and all this is a classic steak shop with a southern/Texan twist. The meats are high quality, which is something to be respected. Our wait to get a table was instant, the waiter knew the menu like the back of his hand, and the drinks weren't bad either.   If you want a high end steak with flair, this is your place!  Revised  3/14/11: Changed from 4 stars to 5. Well deserved, this restaurant was perfect in every way for there demographic."}
{"text":"Steak place that cannot cook steak the way you order it. The waitress was pleasant and the food was delivered quick but if you cannot cook steak the way I ordered it then what is the point?  The man sitting near me ended up returning his steak back as well because it was undercooked."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times in my lifetime and every time I go I experience the worst service. 18 year olds that could give two sh*ts. With 4 table sections I expect a lot more. All I ever see if staff standing around doing nothing. I have been in the food industry a long to time so yes i know i am my own worst enemy when i go out to eat, but find some better servers. You get 3 stars for your food. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Good Service, great atmosphere, girls can show a little enthusiasm into the dance when they do their little show, not just look like a dancing zombie... Food is good, not great. Ribs ARE fall off the bone but a little too over cooked, it had one VERY dry spots. Steak is good too, I had a rib-eye stake and my girlfriend a T-Bone steak. T-bone was pretty good as for the rib-eye, it was OK. The side were awesome though, I got the chilli and a Caesar's salad my girlfriend a loaded potato and a house salad, all delicious.  The amount of food is great, we both still had some leftovers to take home for lunch. Not my #1 choice for a steak or ribs. But it will definitely a spot to drink some beers and margaritas for the price, and enjoy some appetizers."}
{"text":"Me encanta , uno de mis restaurantes preferidos ! La comida y la atención del personal agradable , un lugar para compartir en familia !"}
{"text":"Great ambiance! When I arrived the servers were doing some type of line dance. Service was awesome, my server Nicole took our orders and follow up was spot on! She recommended the steak with the cheese and pepper, great choice! The bread with the cinnamon butter was interesting. It wasn't too sweet, but melted in my mouth. Oh yah, the bucket/pail of peanuts was an excellent touch as well. When I return to Arizona, I'll make sure to come back to this place."}
{"text":"I'm a Dallas raised proud texan. This place is pretty damn good. Barrels of peanuts that is policy to throw the shells on  the ground. Decent menu with plenty of options for a picky family. Check it out. Reasonable prices and is a nice change from McChili's, olive garden, or the likes."}
{"text":"Called ahead @ 6pm with special seating request, ee had 2 out of 5 people needed chairs( handicapped), they said no problem. Hour and 20 mins later still tried to seat us at a booth. Very poor listening skills"}
{"text":"Been to a few Texas Roadhouse locations. This is one of the better ones. Crew were very courteous, and began service right away. I had the pork ribs with fries. Very good, and tender. Gave us plenty of bread, and of course the peanuts were already on the table. Overall had a very good time."}
{"text":"On our way home to Cali, stopped off to eat and found this place. This place wasn't bad. But it's not great either. I did enjoy my fried chicken. Daughter did not like her salad and cheeseburger. Yes the bread was good."}
{"text":"This place was the worst steakhouse I've ever been too. We are currently sitting down writing this review while EVERY WAITER/WAITRESS walks by both of us asking not one asked us if we had even wanted water. I've already asked to move once to the bar and they had said it was not open seating. Yet still no service, place blows I would rather eat at Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Went to Texas Roadhouse a few times and I am a big fan. I order to eat and yes I ordered the NY Steak (18 or 20 oz), it was delicious! I also ordered the onion appetizer dish which was out of this world.  Highly recommended.  Service is always spot on too."}
{"text":"Go here to EAT, not to nibble. You'll be bombarded with tasty comfort food that will make you very happy for the moment but you might find yourself sitting on the couch for a couple hours after asking yourself why you ate so much. The rolls with cinnamon butter are classic and delicious.  Try not to fill up on free peanuts so you can save room for he giant portions of food you'll be presented with.   The margaritas are very tasty and the staff is incredibly friendly. The vibe is fun and casual and they can accommodate big groups with some planning ahead of time."}
{"text":"MR extra char. Is that a foreign concept to anyone else other than the the cooks at this location? Tried them twice. Fail, fail. I didn't think they could make a ribeye taste worse than the last time I was here, but, alas, I was mistaken. No char. Barely any grill marks. This is my 37th Texas Roadhouse location and it is by far the worst. I've had better steaks New Delhi!"}
{"text":"Been to a Texas Roadhouse a few times, but this was my first at this location. This location recently opened. Took me a bit to stop by since the waiting is obscene. New business in town, plenty of people are going to try this place out. However, I did find out is this place takes reservations. I will highly advise you to do this.  I was happy this place opened up, I love BBQ, and they have BBQ, So I decided to order their Grilled chicken salad!! Have to come back again to try the ribs! The salad was great. Comes with bacon, eggs, crouton, and carrots. Chicken is delicious. Serving is huge, you can actually share it with someone if needed. So I ate the whole thing by myself! They make a big deal about their bread. Its good, but I think its funny when they seat you, they tell you we are going to grab your freshly baked bread for you. Just bread, its good, but just bread.  Our server was great, good looking, funny, and made sure the wife and I were fine. Loved how they are supporting the local spring training teams. Have Royals and Rangers pictures up. Not a fan of these team but like how they showed local support. Overall we had a great time, food was great, service was great, price are reasonable. Going to come back again."}
{"text":"Since the daughter likes this place, we ended up here. I am not a huge fan of Texas Roadhouse. Just another steakhouse chain that offers good bread. Now I am not saying this is a bad place! Food is good, service is always friendly, nothing really to complain about! Just nothing special here. Now we have had other experience with Texas Roadhouse at other locations. They are all the same, daughter loves their salad, and cheeseburger! I don't remember what I have had their? So I guess it wasn't that great? But! I know we will probably end up coming here again?"}
{"text":"The food is great. But the one thing that keeps calling me back to this place is those damn dinner rolls with the spread that's served on the side. I've gone in there and ordered those to go just by themselves. Damn you dinner rolls! Why can't I ever resist your warm yeasty goodness?!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this location for years and for the most part have always had a good experience.  Today on Mother's Day it was especially busy and I could see some waiters and waitresses were stressed but when they got to their tables they had smiles on their faces.  Our waitress Nicole was very good. We had a fairly large party and she brought everything out quickly.  As always food was delicious."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for my bday. Waitress checked my ID before giving me a beer but I guess not the date since she didn't say nothing about being my bday or anything. Took them About 20 min to give my food and it looked really crappy compared to other Texas Roadhouse. My BF  has to wait another 20 min to get his food since they gave him the wrong steak and the waitress seemed like she was on a hurry for us to leave and pay. ?"}
{"text":"The roadhouse was busy and hopping even at 10pm on a tuesday night when we popped in for dinner.  We were seated immediately at one of those awkward tables squeezed between two booths.  The kind of table that forces you to invade the privacy of both groups silmutaneously.  Seated there more for the convenience of the waiters than the comfort of the patrons.  No big deal.  We could have asked for a different spot if we were that upset.  Fast service.  Waitress was polite.  Took our orders then brought us a basket of the freshest baked mini loaves of bread with cinamon butter.  Each loaf was about the size of a medium large baked potato.  They were almost undercooked so very doughy and piping hot.  They were delicious.  We each ate two while we waited for our entrees to arrive.  Something must have happened with the doughy bread in our stomachs.  Almost as if the bread continued to rise inside of us.  We were both uncomfortably stuffed when our 20 dollar entrees arrived.  The food looked good but we were to full to eat it.  So- don't eat the bread!  You've been warned!"}
{"text":"Always a great deal - with a friendly staff.   Make sure you checkin online to save wait time. Also leave yourself time to park on busy nights."}
{"text":"First time I have ever been to this restaurant.  It was a mind-blowing flavor explosion!  Awesome food combinations and super knowledgeable, and ultra friendly  staff.  Our server was Steph.  A special shout out to you for making us feel welcome.  Thank you.  Great knowledge of the menu and a super sweet demeanor and personality.  Hopefully your manager is reading this and hears me say:  Job well done :-). Thank you to the whole staff for making my \"State Board Barber Exam Victory Meal\"  a rockin' good one! Cheers y'all!"}
{"text":"Very disgusted with this place.. to start out we were told the wait was only 25 minutes but they wouldn't seat us until our entire party arrived.. no problem but then we ended up waiting over 45 minutes for a table... still not a problem until we finally got our food and I found a long black hair in my corn which I proceeded to send back .. ok still not a problem ... then my granddaughter found ANOTHER long black hair in her rack of ribs..... ok no problem she for some unknown reason said she would just eat it anyway.... then the humdinger!!!! A f'ing cockroach crawled across the table and under my daughter in laws plate .. my son began chasing it to kill it.. he smashes it on the wall. My daughter alerts a waiter standing nearby and his response was \" hmmm, that's weird\" and walked away...a few minutes later the manager comes up and says \" what's going on here\" when we explained what happened they said they would move our food to sit us in another section.!!! REALLY???.. at this point we were not about to take one more bite of that food !! The manager says she will \"take care of the bill\" and walked off. Not another word, no apology...you're dam right you're gonna take care of the bill. How DISGUSTING!! I got the feeling they thought we made it up.. I will Never EVER return to this location!!!!"}
{"text":"I spent my college years going to the local Texas Roadhouse so I was excited to move close to one when I came out to AZ. I have never met anyone who isn't satisfied with the bread and butter. I think the onion is the perfect size for an appetizer and the rattlesnake bites have a nice zesty kick. My standard is the prime rib, but I also enjoy the occasional steak kabobs or roasted chicken. Always greeted with a smile and the service is solid."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Food is decent. This location isn't as good as it once was. I haven't been here for about 3 years. Service was pretty crappy. We come in at 230 on a Sunday \"10 minute wait\". Tons of tables opened. They asked us our favorite number for a pager. Waitress was pretty dumb. Half way through our meal we had to ask for rolls. I got the smothered chicken was pretty good. Sweet potato was okay, only thing that saved it was the cinnamon butter. Fresh veggies more like a frozen bag thrown in the microwave"}
{"text":"Omg where do I begin with this place! Service was fantastic! We were served by one of the O.G.'s of the place and she was the nicest, most informative and SOOOO observant - we were literally lacking NOTHING. The food was delicious! BBQ pulled pork dinner, Porterhouse T-Bone and the bone in Rib eye were cooked just the way we wanted. My mom referred to my T-bone as \"the butter\".(ex: let me have another bite of that butter!\") LOL. The rib eye was \"like biting into a meaty cloud\" haha.... The house steak sauce was the bees freakin knees - and only $3.99! Mmmmm!   Also, it was my BF's first time stopping in so they brought him a big sack of nuts, a coupon for a free appetizer and a thing to sign up for their email list. Very effective marketing move given his reaction"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place last night because the Outback down the road has been pretty bad lately. This place always seems busy so we went searching for an app. Turns out they have one and you can check in via the app to save time.  We were glad we did, as the wait was easily over an hour when we arrived. The place was packed and there are nice little benches outside to sit and wait. Because we checked in before we left home we were sat after only about 10 minutes.  We ordered drinks (Coke for me and a beer for the hubs) as well as their version of a blooming onion, which they call a cactus blossom.  For our meals we ordered a New York Strip and a Ribeye (both mid rare).  The blossom arrived fairly quickly but I was not happy with the flavor. The breading was more like tempura batter with no seasoning and the sauce was a combination of ketchup, Mayo, and relish.  The flavor was strange for sure.  They did provide free rolls but the butter had cinnamon in it which was strange.   The steaks came out within about 20 minutes. They were cooked correctly. The entrées all around tasted good.  With all being said this place is a solid choice for a steak dinner.  The prices are reasonable and the service is prompt. We will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Was very pleased with the ribeye steak that I had.  It was perfectly seasoned, and cooked medium rare as I requested.  The steak prices are actually very reasonable considering the high quality of the steaks.   I can see why this place stays so busy!"}
{"text":"I'm curious to know if people who live in this side of town even know what good service is because I frequently have issues with the restaurants in this area. This establishment has been the worst of them!  I have ordered to go dinners from them twice now and each time they have screwed it up royally! The last instance was the icing on the cake. I was missing the shrimp to my shrimp and steak meal and then the steak was so over cooked it was rubber. The time before that they overlooked the steak and they offered a redo. This time with the shrimp and over cooked steak they offered a refund and after 10 days of waiting for it to be credited back to my mother-in-laws card we never received it! Needless to say, there won't be any returning. Learn to cook a freaking steak if you're in the business of steak houses!"}
{"text":"For the money, this place rocks.  The food is consistent, it's a fun atmosphere and as everyone says the rolls are awesome.  There's a reason it's always packed, and it's not for the peanuts!  The steaks are more reasonably priced than outback, and you get a simliar quality of food.    For those who put low stars, they are probably snobs.  This doesn't compare to a place like Maestros or Mortons, but it's not trying to.  It's easy to feed a family of 4 on a modest budget and have everyone grinning ear to ear.  My experience is that they aren't perfectt, but if you want something fixed they fix it.  Yes, they sing and dance, but that's part of the charm.  Obviously they are doing something right, so come join the fun with and open mind and your wallet will be happy too!"}
{"text":"I had been running some very stressful, difficult errands all day long and had not had time to eat since 4am and now it was 3:30pm. I look around and realize that I need something more substantial than fast food. I spy this Texas Roadhouse as I am zipping up Stapley and my rumbling tummy screams, \"I WANT STEAK!\"  I hustle my bustle into this country and western themed steakhouse and was seated right away. I was surprised that the place was about 80% full of customers at this time of the afternoon, but soon figured out why. They have \"early bird\" specials for $8.99 (served 3pm-6pm Monday-Friday). I responded to the cry of my rowdy tummy and ordered the 6 ounce sirloin steak with a salad, sweet potato, and soft, warm white rolls with cinnamon butter. The rolls are awesome and the salad was a surprise--it was very large for a dinner salad and included egg and cheese as well as the lettuce, red cabbage, croutons, and tomatoes. The sweet potato was perfect with butter and brown sugar on the side. The steak looked more like 8 ounces instead of 6 ounces, was flavorful, and tender (I was expecting a shoe leather consistency at this price point). The steak was grilled perfectly to my desired level of doneness.   The server was excellent and checked back several times during the meal to see if I needed anything. Parking is plentiful and close to the door. Overall, an extremely excellent value for the money with the bonus of tasty food and great service. I will be back."}
{"text":"First off, the floor is covered with peanut shells. Barrel of peanuts as soon as you walk in the door. We called ahead and was seated within 10 mins of our arrival. Hostess sat us, never saying that the menus were at the end of the table. While reviewing the menu all the servers stopped and started clapping and dancing. Um, hello? Your place is packed and you have time for this? Ewe. This places is loud ! You can hardly hear other people at your own table talking! The table next to us was sat about 5 mins after we were and they got their drinks and we still have not gotten ours. It seems the hostesses like to yell and shout when a new comer arrives. I'm guessing that's what the shouting was about. The house salad was light and fresh. Nice topping on the salad as well. Rib eye arrived perfectly seasoned and cooked to my perfect temperature. It was slightly fatty but delish! Veggies were steamed perfectly and not mushy. All and all the food was great the ambiance is not my cup of tea. Next day, after our visit, diarrhea all day. Yeah. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I have to say the hostess Even, was the sweetest hostess ever! She guided our party to our table and sent late comers directly to us. This was the highlight of this visit.  Once seated the bread and honey butter were delish! Sadly the menus were FILTHY! Some one didn't do their job! We ordered an appetizer and that was just ok. Got the combo and substituted fried picked for the rattlesnake. Heads up, all wings are nuggets aka boneless. Our party ordered and now it's been more then 15 mins and no food. I'm not a fan of all the nut shells on the floor but I guess it hides the dropped fork I keep stepping on.  Food finally arrives and it's cooked to perfectly. Mashed potatoes were super salty tho... ick. The servers, runners and busters couldn't have been nicer. Not my favorite place but others seem to really like it...."}
{"text":"... We've been to this location several times as we live down the street. On occasion we have less than stellar service, or food, but for the majority of the time all is well. I enjoy that they have in-booth child seating so we can sit side by side to our 15 month old instead of her at the end of a table in an awkward high chair while getting bumped into by anyone walking by. At our last visit, our little one took quite a liking to our server and our server was very pleasant and cheerful about it. My only \"complaint\" is sometimes when you need your server, they are doing a group dance. While I understand it's part of the atmosphere, sometimes it's exactly when you NEED something. Granted, the little one enjoys it and claps along so it's still a cute gimmick! Now, if you asked my husband about food, he would flip a lid because he swears the 5 ounce steak is well under 5 ounces. I told him it's weighed before it's cooked.. BUT we do have steak once a week at home and we weigh our food for macros so I can see where he would be a little grumpy about it since we notice a difference compared to a 5 ounce portion at home.. he can write his own review about it though because I don't order the steak here ;)"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving three stars instead of one is because our server (Matthew) tried so hard to fix other mistakes that weren't his fault AND because I like their damn rolls! We had a party of 9 plus 2 high chairs.. But when served, only one half of the table received their food while the other half (my half, of course, and I'm pregnant so what the hell) waited with anticipation since \"they're right behind me\"..... Ten minutes later my husband received his steak by a manager and we heard again the rest was right behind them and then eventually the rest of the table received their food after the other half was about done.. Except that I ordered the hamburger and fries and they served me a hamburger on a big plate.. Soooo.. Where are the fries, right? Server Matt grabbed me some and an extra basket for the table since it had taken so long except now.. guess what.. the fries literally taste like fish sticks.. All of them did.. Not sure what happened since I feel like more people would complain if they always tasted like that but sure as shit, everyone tasted them at the table and were like \"yep, fish sticks\".. Don't fucking fry anything in the same oil as fish.. What the fuck? That's cooking 101.. My mom said her grilled chicken was black because it picked up whatever char was left from what they cooked prior.. My husband enjoyed his steak, though..   It's not nearby and this is the second time I've been here and while step up in service, but not food, since our last visit, it's unlikely I'll willingly return..   PS - last time we are here was for Mother's Day a few years back.. Try crammed like 9 of us on a booth (not a pull-out one) and we had to stack our own dishes on the ground since no one would properly wait on us and move crap since it was such a cluster fuck of too many people in a booth!"}
{"text":"Called 2 hours prior to accommodate a party of 10.  Person who answered phone said, \"let me connect you with the large party division.\"  Told us to call back in 1 hour to get on the list.  Showed up at time requested, waited about 15 minutes, which was not a big deal. Once seated, we were sat at 2 different tables.  Jennifer, our waitress said \"it's a fire code violation at their restaurant to ever seat a party of 10 together.\"  Manager confirmed fire code policy and told us we could speak to the owner if we liked....   not good enough!!!  Train your employees on any policies needed prior to conflicts with potential customers."}
{"text":"Food and service were great - no complaints there. Complaints are with the NOISE level of the restaurant, oh my god - do NOT try to have a first date here. I was out to dinner with my wife and felt like I was shouting at her and she was sitting right across from me. ROWDY is one word to explain it. I honestly walked out and breathed a sigh of relief, I could hear myself think. I honestly don't know if we'll be back due to how loud it was. We've been to other Roadhouse's and nothing has compared to this. It's not like I wanted a quiet, romantic dinner. I just wanted to have a normal conversation about my day but could barely be heard. Ruins much of the experience."}
{"text":"We checked in and were told 20 minute wait. No problem! But, when people are being seated before us even a table of 8 come on! My husband asked the girl who gave us the buzzer how much longer will the wait be she said how many? He said 2! You told me 20 minutes and it's been 30 minutes she said ok your next. Another girl took us to a booth no problem but I did ask her did the girl upfront forget about us? She said no!  Our waitress was great but the girl up front definitely needs to get it together."}
{"text":"Summer is coming. That might not mean much, but to women it means everything.  Like how they're going to stuff that size ten butt into a size four bikini in the next few months without looking like an overstuffed sausage.  Well, here's some bad news for all you hungry girls. You have no chance of losing anything (maybe your boyfriend or husband) if you come here with any regularity.   Remember the name of the place? Texas Roadhouse? Well these folks take pride in serving 'Texas' sized meals. Which for the normal person should put them about two meals ahead of their eating schedule.   Service was friendly and fast. Food was superb. And judging by the looks of the women in this place, they have no clue we'll be in triple digits in about 90 days, relegating them to a nice big onesy at the pool  this summer.  Nice job TR. I enjoyed my pulled pork. Fried pickles, salad, and bucket 'o peanuts.  I thank you. Lowes Home Improvement center does not however, as I went next door after lunch and farted my way through every aisle, crop dusting as if I was a  former WWll pilot."}
{"text":"Was in town a few days for work and thought I'd try this place for dinner. Ordered a sirloin steak with baked potato and was rewarded with a very tasty cut of meat which was cooked perfectly. Their rolls are also really good and the peanuts are an interesting treat. To top it off, the service was amazing!"}
{"text":"Service was on point it was Father's Day I get it was busy my ribeye wasn't as exactly cook the way I liked but over all was a decent experience with my family."}
{"text":"Our food was fantastic. Service was great. (Thanks Jenna!) Everything exceeded our expectations!"}
{"text":"While the waitress we had was great, the restaurant itself was not up to expectations.  The floors were sticky, the bathrooms were dirty, and the food was very salty.  While  we have eaten at other restaurants in this chain before and will likely stop at one in the future, we will not go back to this one again."}
{"text":"Took my dad and family to Texas roadhouse for Father's Day lunch/dinner had a serious long wait and the food was terrible. Had to send steak back twice, still didn't get it right. Chicken dish was too salty and my ribeye was fatty and undercooked. The sad part is this is my dad's favorite restaurant and the experience was beyond horrible. Next time I will trust my instincts and go to Flemings. At least the manager was nice and tried to fix the problem, but the damage was already done."}
{"text":"ATTN: ALL OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE HERE ARE TRUE!! This is clearly not how it's done in Texas!! What an insult to the great state! Server was rude to us, tried talking to manager and ended up getting the owner. He couldn't take the hard truth about how poor the customer service was so he kicked out our group. Poor customer service is a result of a poor hiring process which is clearly a reflection on management here. Well in this case a reflection on the owner. There are obviously better locations and restaurants. You truly get what you pay for here... a whole lotta nothing! Hey, at least our alcohol was free!"}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is phenomenal! Great food, service, prices, and atmosphere! God Bless."}
{"text":"I love Texas Roadhouse back in Maryland and this location was awesome! I've never seen them randomly line dance but they did it twice while we were there. I heard our perky really nice young 20 year old waitress tell a customer that she couldn't give her something she needed because the company required that they dance. That's strange. Sure it's fun but maybe they need to hire dancers to line dance instead of making staff stop their serving to dance for five minutes. Food can get cold and waters will need to be refilled. But I was fine. There are a lot of birthdays at this place so be prepared to listen to the staff sing and announce birthdays all night. I got the filet and it was sooo amazing! I'm glad my fun knowledgeable waitress recommended the shrimp to accompany it! The shrimp is sweet seduction ! Big sexy thick grilled shrimp basking in the most amazingly seasoned juice ! My steak was perfectly cooked but the steak fries were struggling and rather limp. I love the green beans here. Their rolls came out piping hot and don't get me started on that amazing cinnamon honey butter! Our waitress was awesome and there was a cute young guy who also helped us! My margarita was very good"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying if I could give NO stars I would. When we first arrived with our party of 5, two of us ordered beers. It took us reminding her about about the beers until she brought them.. The server was ILENE (horrible). When she brought our order 1 was supposed to be Oven Roasted half chicken with ribs and she brought out Grilled Chicken breast. When I told her the order was wrong she told me \"Oh we're out of that chicken\" and she gave me no option to send it back or to even ask if I wanted something else. Also my whole family (4) ordered a cup of chili and when she brought it out we asked for spoons her response was \"I don't think we have any\" and she never came back with clarification if they \"had\" spoons. About 40 minutes later we reminded her if she ever checked for any spoons. She said \"let me check, I don't think so.\" I said \"I'm sure you have spoons somewhere.\" When she finally brought the spoons our chili was already cold. Mind you this was around 920pm and they close at 11pm. When the two that got beers asked for another one she said \"it's last call\" (@ 930PM). WTFFFF!?!?! When finally brought the second round of beers one asked for lime and her response was \"They threw them away...\" Without any ATTEMPT to find one. The last annoying thing she did was ask me if we wanted cups for our DRINKS to go and we said \"Yes\" this lady brought out To Go Containers for SOUP. (like are you kidding me).  By far, the most unpleasant experience I've ever had with a waitress. She will definitely make me think twice before coming back. AGAIN THAT WAS ILENE FROM TEXAS ROADHOUSE ON 75th & MCDOWELL."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the food and atmosphere here many times over the years, but recently the service has been lacking. Today, I ordered my usual with the house salad as one of my sides, with blue cheese dressing, like I always do. When Emma brought it, there was also a small container with blue cheese crumbles included, as well as the dressing. I thought, \" what a nice touch\". When the bill came, there was an up charge of 50 cents. I asked the waitress about it, she tried to tell me that she asked me if I wanted it and that I told her yes. What she really said when I ordered the salad was something along the lines of, \" everything on the salad ok?\" She reluctantly offered to delete the charge, but I declined. I ate it, so I am willing to pay for it, but I detest deception. I think she was being sneaky about trying to add a little to the bill, thinking I would not notice. Apart from that, her whole demeanor was that she could not get away from the table fast enough. I think if she could have tossed items on the table as she passed by, she would have. When she dropped the bill, she tossed it on top of the peanuts bucket, with no check presenter. Overall, she is a tacky, graceless server. Texas Roadhouse, you can do better. 1 star is for the \"service\". The food is 4 stars."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Good meal, good service.  Started sneezing immediately upon walking in, due to the peanut dust. My little tiny family members have SEVERE peanut allergies, and I IMPLORE you to please put your peanut sign on the door, much more visible than it is now. A bucket of peanuts on every table and all over the floor warrants a very large warning with flashing lights and sirens ( joking, but not joking) While they were not with us thankfully, even the smallest amount of peanut dust can send them into a severe allergic reaction. Your sign is not noticeable, please make it stand out more."}
{"text":"We've been here quite a few times over the years and have only had one bad experience a few years ago. In that case we talked to the manager and he not only comped our meal (there were 4 of us), he gave us a $50 gift card toward our next visit.  As I said, that was our only bad experience. Four of us went there last week and once again, fabulous. I can't say enough good about this restaurant. It may be a little noisy but the staff are very friendly and attentive. The food is absolutely delicious whether it's the appetizers, entrees or desserts.  Their steaks are so juicy and tender, they just melt in your mouth. No sauces are even required. I'd love to know their secret so I could grill them like that myself.  I believe I'm a customer for life!"}
{"text":"Last night I decided to take my wife out to diner to celebrate a special occasion. The service was horrible. We got there, ordered our food got it. When we got our stakes they where 50% greasy fat and 50% meat. My wife and I asked for a well done steak and we got medium well. I explained to a manager that we asked for well done because my wife was pregnant and he blew us off he didn't even bother to ask us if we wanted different steak. Our sides where also cold and where brought out as we were leaving. We only saw our waitress twice. Once when We got our order and a second time when she brought our food out. I had to get up twice for refills and walk over to the bar. I also had to ask the front end people for our bill. I was very disappointed and feel like we got crappy service. Our waitress Reba was horrible and so was her ignorant manager. I will never visit this place again!"}
{"text":"Too busy yeehaa all over to bring our dinner salad. Saturday is not the night to go, even though it was our anniversary celebration."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for any meal! It's always so fun when you walk in! The staff for the most part is friendly and the food comes quick! The prices aren't bad especially the dine in early menu! Also major pops to them, first place I went out to eat that didn't make me throw up(I'm pregnant) can't say enough great things!"}
{"text":"although they have them at home in california, i have never been to one. i was dragged out here by a bunch of colleagues right after work for dinner and drinks. the place was loud but that worked out great for my group of cackling ladies. we all had a margarita and let me tell you, they did not skimp on the tequila, we could taste it through the fruity flavor and we were def ok with that. we never got our peanuts, i'm going to assume that'd the appetizer, but we did get baskets of warm delicious bread. i couldnt help but stuff my mouth with a warm greasy roll as soon as they landed on our table. i ended up ordering the three piece catfish meal and wow - after 2 pieces i was already stuffed. our server was great and super attentive and we had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Bar type vibe, which isn't surprising. I would not have chose to visit this place, my co worker wanted to go here. In any case the service was nice / friendly, which was to highlight of the meal. I ordered a sirloin, which was just not good. No flavor and not tender at all, it was also overcooked based on my request for rare. I did get a mashed potatoes side, which was the best part of the meal.   Overall: service friendly/good. Food, mediocre at best. If I was solely judging on food this would be a 1.5 stars."}
{"text":"Food was ok . My husband had the prime rib and i had veggies and Potatoes and mushrooms. Our waitress was awesome but the food was not what we are used to in NJ. Would not return to this location."}
{"text":"Portions are Texas sized, food was tasty, and Rose was a great server (knowledgeable and oh so friendly)!"}
{"text":"just had dinner tonight and we had a great experience.      everything was on time and fresh.   bread and butter and entrees were all fantastic.  the server Brooklyn was a sweetheart funny and really nice.  anybody that reads this if you had a bad experience with a server ask for Brooklyn you  will love her.      I will be back for more laughs and great food  and service.   I even got rolls to go."}
{"text":"Always can expect the same meal. I have tried the higher priced steaks. Maybe I'm just super simple; the sirloin works well for me with a salad and sweet potato. Service is always great, perfect timing. It's already stressful with kids, but they are all super nice. Even when they are packed, we call ahead and don't really have to wait long."}
{"text":"This is one of the places i go to for some good steaks. I usually order the largest ribeye. Then usually share it with someone. It's plenty steak enough to fill you up. I love the bread too.  I would recommend this place for steaks. Really haven't had anything else on the menu.  Service was good, they usually take good care of me. It's rather loud during busy times. So not a nice quite place to talk over dinner kinda place. Especially when the waitress line dance, and there's them birthday songs too.   Hope you enjoy."}
{"text":"And down we go. The quality of the food has gone way down, the last few of times I had dinner were complete letdowns.   One rib-eye was so salty I had to send it back (\"Golly gee Mr,  that's the 3rd customer who said that tonight!\") the next one was tough as leather, I gave up -my dogs enjoyed it together with the potato and rolls.The Caesar salads had no dressing (twice), the roasted 1/2 chicken was still all pumped up, barely roasted enough to be eaten. The prime rib was a bit tough and mainly boring. The corn was not on the cob, looked like frozen and the bacon on the potato tasted totally artificial.   I still like their Margaritas with an extra shot but I got nothing good to say about the food. The reason I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 is that service is always very good and it's cheap."}
{"text":"Squeezed 5 of us into a booth for 3-4. Noise level is very loud. Lots of echoing. Personnel could be more customer friendly. Better come early this place fills up quickly. If anyone has a nut allergy don't come here. Peanut shells all over the floor, buckets of peanuts at every table. Seating is wooden benches. Not very comfortable but ok. Appetizer plates brought to the table had dried food on them, we had to ask for clean plates."}
{"text":"Our first visit to the New Texas Roadhouse in Wilkins Township wasn't as I expected. We love the Texas Roadhouse In Greensburg and was hoping to have the same experience. It was horrible. First time mishaps  Our second outing was Wonderful! Gabriella was wonderful attentive and a great server.  Food was out timely, as was ordered and hot.  We highly recommend and excited a Texas Roadhouse is so close to home !!  We will return !! Ask for Gabriella you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I returned yesterday (7/26/15) for a try at the steak selection.  The 16 oz Rib-eye was calling my name so I gave it a try.  My description of it was \"Mouthwatering delicious\".  I love a quality cut of steak, usually ordering at least a rib eye or prime rib, so my expectations was set at high and they did not disappoint.  Theis steak was flavorful, nearly a fork to cut it, and the veggies were pleasing to the pallet.  A definite return spot..."}
{"text":"Really enjoy my visits here. The steaks are delicious and priced well. The staff is friendly and on-point. They accidentally overcooked my steak once and brought me a new one free of charge, no questions asked. Overall, well-priced, cool environment, and a great place for a steak dinner!  I have no complaints aside from myself not making a reservation and having to wait... but they have call ahead seating, so don't forget to call ahead!"}
{"text":"Always a good choice.  Always a favorite  A bucket of peanuts and  a basket of hot bread, served with cinnamon butter from the moment you sit down.  How could it get any better than that?  Well it could get much better if you remember to get to Texas Roadhouse before 6 p.m for the early bird specials.  I had steak and rib dinner, my sister had the sirloin, and my nephew had the chicken critters. The portions at Texas Roadhouse are large and cooked to perfection.   The ribs were fall off the bone tender and delicious.  The next time I go back I'll have to bring my rib eating friends. The steak was so tender,  it really was like cutting butter.    Great food, great prices, and amazing customer service.  If you enjoy a good steak stop by Texas Roadhouse you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"MY FIRST TIME ..  BUT NOT MY LAST   A bucket of peanuts and a basket of hot bread with cinnamon butter from the moment you sit down. How could it get any better then that!! It could get much better if you remember to get there before 6Pm for the earlier bird specials.  I had the steak and rib dinner. The portions were large and cooked to perfection.  The ribs were tender fall of the bone delicious! I will be back and bring my rib eating friends.   The steak is so melt in your mouth tender it really is like butter!  Better than any Ruth's Chris or Morton's out there and at a great price!! The service is as good as the food. Lots of attention from the staff.  This place is amazing - its #1 for me in the steakhouse category and will be my go to spot when i want to have an amazing dining experience and great food!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. I also had the pulled-pork sandwich which was flavorful and tasteful. Nice \"roadhouse\" decor. It gets a little loud but nothing too crazy. The drinks are decent but don't expect any type of buzz from the cocktails."}
{"text":"It was a very busy night but the service was excellent and the food was good. I had to have them Refire my ribeye and the manager was blaming it on the lighting which perturbed me but after that it was all good."}
{"text":"The roadhouse is great! Who doesn't like the unlimited fresh sweet rolls and cinnamon butter, and the peanuts in shell while you're waiting. I love the trashed shells scattered throughout the restaurant floor, it gives it character and a unique \"country\" feeling. And if that mess on the floor bothers you, you've got a stick up you a** and need to take a deep breath and relax a little. Haha Anyway, the bbq chicken was pretty good and the price was great at $9.99 and that comes with two \"homemade sides.\" (They preached the word homemade about 6 times while we were there). My buddy got a half slab of the \"world famous\" ribs and he said they were pretty good but needed just a bit more bbq sauce. The drink prices were reasonable and the location is great, just north of interstate 10 and 75th ave. in the west part of the phx valley.  Service was above average and the music volume was at a good level. Nothing crazy awesome, or really special, but very good and at a good price!"}
{"text":"What can I say thhhey have great steaks, cooked to order.  The atmosphere is laid back and chill with country music is the background. Try the rattlesnake bites they are awesome ! Don't for get about the awesome bread and the butter!!"}
{"text":"Best stake house in Champaign. I also like the free peanuts they serve before you order your meal. Atmosphere is very warm."}
{"text":"It was Super Bowl evening and I thought it would be perfect to avoid the evening crowd at the Roadhouse!  Little to no traffic and I was right, plenty of parking at the restaurant.  My wife ordered the 8oz sirloin and it was delectable, grilled perfectly, tender and delicious.  I ordered a half rack of ribs as I have had them before and they were always fabulous.  It didn't work out that way however.  They were burned black and dry and chewy.  I took one bite and returned them,  You get 2 sides with your meal, the wife had a loaded baked potato which she said was \"really really nice\", and I ordered the steak fries, which were just OK.  Our second side was the house salad, cold, crisp fresh lettuce, tomatoes, shredded cheddar, croutons, and chopped hard boiled eggs, a truly lovely salad!  The waiter agreed with me that the ribs were burnt and I wonder why he didn't do anything about it before he served them.  I had to wait almost half an hour for it's replacement and by then the wife had finished eating and I had lost my appetite.  As usual it was very very loud with the three major sources of noise being generated, the guests, the staff singing Happy Birthday and the overhead sound system playing loud music.  Several staff members apologized for the ribs and I was told I wouldn't be charged for them.  They even offered to send a new side along with the new boxed ribs, I declined.  There was a bucket of fresh tasting large peanuts on the table which I am sure helped cut my appetite in absence of my ribs.  We will probably return again some time in the future to give them another chance."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe how busy this place was on a weekday. Got seated quickly with Bread when we sat down. Loved that! Food was great. Service top notch."}
{"text":"Well, my mother, my two kids and myself stopped in just before 5 for dinner. When we got there the place was about 3/4 full. We were seated after about 5 minutes- not bad! And the hostess brought the delicious rolls to the table as we were being seated. Sadly, there begins and ends the positives about this \"steakhouse\".   First, whatever sadist was in charge of the music kept it at an ear splitting volume. Like, dance-club make-your-ears-pop volume. Then, for some reason, it gets turned down (Hallelujah), only to have a server SCREAM at the top of her lungs something like a birthday cheer a-long. Everyone around her looked really uncomfortable and irritated, but kudos for the party spirit! Seriously, TR, even TGIFridays has abandoned this awfulness. But the staff led fun was just beginning. Periodically a group of staff would line up and do a kind of half-hearted line dance that, literally, everyone was awkwardly trying to ignore.   The food. I ordered the filet medallions covered in mushroom sauce. What came out was 9 ounces of medium rare salt cubes covered in salt gravy and seasoned with salt. My son ate all his Kraft Mac n cheese (to be fair, they're very honest about serving Kraft). My daughter got the mini cheeseburgers and kinda played with it. My mother had the regular filet and was neither impressed nor disgusted.   I feel like TR missed the boat on campy 90s chain restaurants. If they'd work a little on improving the quality of their food and less on really bad ambience (I'm a native Texan, I'm just praying people don't actually associate us with that stuff), I might return. Not holding out hope."}
{"text":"While my Husband loves this place for the steak, I would tolerate it by getting the crispy chicken critters, which WAS the best chicken strips out there, the batter and quality of chicken was so good!  Welp, that has all changed!  Might as well go to Dennys or BK for chicken strips!  The quality of the chicken has gone way down to pink slim lol with its regular bread crumbs breading blahh!  I hope they bring back the original recipe! While thats my only complaint, staff is always friendly, sides were still good."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of big chain steakhouses.  And I'm not going to cheer for this one before I try it again.  But first visit was very pleasant and the food we had was well prepared.  Next trip will tell the tale.  Didn't have a steak, but the guy next to me did and he said it was perfect--and it was a true medium rare!"}
{"text":"Not that great. Food is sub par. I am always cold when I go."}
{"text":"It's not the best barbecue in Arizona, but it's not bad for a chain. The steak is normally a really nice cut of meat and the ribs fall off the bone. Definitely load up on the bread. These rolls are bomb dot com. The staff is overall pretty great, although I've seen some pretty stupid patrons of this establishment here."}
{"text":"The only reason it gets 4 stars is because can't  rate in half. The waitress we had was rude and abrupt. It took a while for the waitress to even come for our drink order. We finally got to order. We got our salads, then suddenly the food was at the table didn't have time to rest a minute between salad and main course. I ordered chili as well and that never came til I asked about the chili. The food was very enjoyable. I really liked the chili, it's different in a way, its got a nice suddle bite at the end. I got chicken and ribs. The wife got her prime rib, which was cooked perfectly. Overall it was a good experience though, despite the waitress. Love the decor, there is a huge mureal of a native American in the one dinning area that caught my eye, it's very intriguing."}
{"text":"This is not my first time here.  It's kinda cool that they have all-you-can-eat peanuts.  And their bread rolls are really good.  The rest of their food is just average.  Not great, not bad.  I'd probably give 3 stars for the food.  Maybe 2.5 stars (if Yelp allowed).  But they are inconsistent.  This time was particularly bad.  This is the second time we have walked out of here. We sit for a half hour and don't get water or menus.  I ask for them, receive many apologies, and then the server disappears after bringing them.  He did come back after about 60 seconds to see if we had decided, and then was gone for at least 15-20 minutes before I got up and left.    That's right.  Sitting at that table for nearly an hour and getting only water and menus (after asking for them), and never getting even to submit our order.  Never again. Food was always average, but service was either very good or very bad.  This time very (very) bad.  The food certainly isn't good enough to tolerate that.  At least I got some peanuts, otherwise I would have been getting a headache from hunger."}
{"text":"Food was great!  Ribs were amazingly tender. Steak had great flavor.  Wait was long and they don't accommodate larger parties. Other then that... We really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Love their ribs and rolls. Always friendly, fast service. They always send us home with warm rolls ---irresistible"}
{"text":"Love Texas Road House. I've been to several across the US and the steaks are excellent and the service is great."}
{"text":"This is always a solid choice for a nice steak dinner. Fried pickles are always fabulous, steak well cooked. Service is good. It's usually a really long wait, so make reservations online when possible or call y get on the list. It definitely has the chain restaurant feel and that's basically why the three stars. It's a good weeknight stop, nothing fancy just basic good food and drinks."}
{"text":"Filet medallions were the most tender steak I have ever had!! Peppercorn sauce was great"}
{"text":"This placed was packed on a saturday night when I came here for a birthday dinner. We had a 15 minute wait, which wasn't bad considering there was several big parties. There were several \"yee haws\" yelled throughout the dinner. Let's say when restaurants are busy, they want people in and out. In result this makes food orders come out extremely fast and I feel as if we were rushed in eating.   I have to make a comment about their rolls: CINNAMON BUTTER?! What were you guys smoking?! I mean, whoever made this up must have been intoxicated or absolutely a cinnamon lover or something. I personally think this is disgusting. There's nothing better than a nice roll (which they have) and nice normal butter. (Even though I think rolls with gravy is absolutely to die for)  Salad wasn't bad. I thought it was pretty good, their ranch dressing though is absolutely chunky though. At one point I was wondering if it was bleu cheese. Chili was my other side, which came loaded, which I have to say pretty delicious. I wish the onions were a little more cooked though. Other than that no complaints there. Anyways, on to the steak.   I ordered the New York Strip, cooked medium rare. (oh yeah, those who don't like blood, it's all about that juice!)  I enjoyed the steak. Lets say it was cooked really well, and it got me full! (I attached a picture if you want to see the inside) I also ordered the extra that topped the steak off with \"sautéed\" mushrooms and onions. Yeah, \"sautéed\" is key here. Mushrooms, yeah not bad it was pretty good. Onions? ABSOLUTELY RAW. You read that right.  My suggestion: Skip the extra sautéed mushrooms and onions on the steak. Spend that extra 1.99 on a drink and have more fun. Also, order that natural butter, because it will make that roll irresistible."}
{"text":"On an impromptu road trip to Arizona, my family stopped in on the way home to grab some lunch.  We waited about 15 minutes to be seated, and when our turn to be seated arrived, we had nothing but grade A+ customer service.  The hostess greeted, welcomed, and sat our party of six into a booth.  Our server Ethan then came up to the table, introduced himself, and started taking our order.  He recited our drink, and appetizer order by memory, and returned within minutes with our beverages.  Now, getting a drink, and appetizer memorized and accurate isn't much difficulty for some.  However, Ethan's personality, attentiveness, accuracy, and genuine likeable demeanor made the entire difference in the experience.  He could've served us slop on a tray, and it wouldn't have really mattered because he was just that phenomenal.  Now, don't get me wrong, the food was FANTASTIC!  I had the sirloin, bbq chicken, with a baked sweet potato, and house salad.  Everything from top to bottom on my plate was incredible, and let's take a moment to savor the thought of a ooey, gooey, warm baked sweet potato with butter, and brown sugar on it!  I chose these set of toppings because I was afraid the marshmallow topping would be too sweet, but that is next on my next visit!  From start to finish, EVERYTHING was nothing short of incredible in service, speed, efficiency, and quality for food, and staff.  I'm extremely grateful to have had this experience, and with many more treks to AZ coming up, this will be a DEFINITE pit stop on the way home!  Thank you Ethan, and to the Goodyear team so much for the superb experience!  We can't wait to see you again, soon!!"}
{"text":"The food is quite tasty. Of course it is usually more cooked than you ordered. So, for example, order medium if you want it to be medium well. The service is usually acceptable."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fun, great food but most of all, amazing prices!!! For a family of 5 to go out for less that $100 bucks is amazing. This mom is all about it! Lots to choose from and the amount of food you get is incredible. Don't forget the amazing rolls and butter! Oh, and cowboy dress is totally acceptable!!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a big fan of themed chain steakhouses.  After enjoying my first dinner here earlier this year I was pleasantly surprised.  We have been back several times over the last few months and have not been disappointed.  The steaks are tasty, tender and always cooked to the requested temperature.  The side dishes are good and the salads are fresh and chilled.  They must have a good training department because the staff is consistently friendly and efficient.  Try the prime rib on the weekends.  Good meal at a good price."}
{"text":"This was our second visit. Everything was delicious. Food was served promptly and hot! Our Server Jimmy, was attentive with out being annoying."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service everytime I've been here. Always hot bread and cinnamon honey butter at our table. I've noticed this location gets very busy around 5pm during the weekend."}
{"text":"The food, the atmosphere, the price and the server Anthony were all excellent. Call early to get on their waitlist it saves the waiting time."}
{"text":"I needed 3 dozen rolls on Sunday and Jose went over and above that I got those rolls on time for a big family dinner.  Kudos to this great staff during this busy time of the year...they really stepped up.  Great service!!!"}
{"text":"Go BIG or go home, folks!!! To kick Father's Day Weekend off on a Texas size steak my Dad ordered the 24 oz Ribeye & was literally catapulted into HOG HEAVEN!!! The 45 minute wait was SO WORTH it....& as other reviewers have mentioned, this place is ROCKIN' BUSY, yet the Staff does an EXCELLENT job!!! Special shoutout of THANKS to our server, Miss Jessie for taking care of us & to our hostesses who all went above & beyond the call of duty :) My Dad is a handicapped veteran & y'all treated him like a king. That doesn't happen often. Dining with you not only made him smile, it gave him a sense of confidence I hadn't seen for awile. GOD BLESS YOU for your hospitality & kindness!!! We'll most DEFINITELY be back with the rest of our family...WOO HOOOOOO!!!"}
{"text":"Decided last minute to go have dinner with a girlfriend. Place was crowded for a Thursday night was wondering what was up. Bar had open seating and able to sit right away. Everyone was courteous and conversational. Food typical comfort food at a great price. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I am updating my rating for this restaurant. My change is to add a star to the rating and make a compliment about the service. In general, the staff at this location is stellar. Always fast at refilling drinks, correcting mistakes, bringing bread and cleaning away dishes, the staff has a good and consistent approach.   Additionally, the steak is pretty much always prepared to order correctly. The last several times my precious complaints about sides being dry (broccoli specifically) were not true, as they've been prepared hot but juicy not tasteless and dry.  Prices have risen slightly with costs over the years, but pretty much to be expected and in line with the market.  Texas Roadhouse still is our weekly steak dinner out location."}
{"text":"Ok so I've been to a few different locations across the country but this was my first time at this one. The food is always pretty good. But this location has the service thing down! Everyone was super nice and polite. I've never seen so many smiling employees. They were fairly young so I imagine many of them have cell phones - didn't see them hanging out and texting. I wish I remembered our servers name - she was great. I had the veggie plate - Love the green beans here and everything tasted fresh. My salad plate wasn't hot and the salad was crisp and fresh. I suppose my only complaint would be that I would have preferred a couple of actual bacon slices to what appeared to be store bought bacon bits for my salad. They were ok but fresh is always better!"}
{"text":"If you've been to Logan's Roadhouse, you've been here.  The similarity is uncanny, right down to the peanut buckets and birthday ya-hoo's.  The service was good, the only drawback was the food.  I had the smokehouse burger, and it has the distinction of being the single worst restaurant burger that I have ever had.  It had everything - meat cooked well beyond what I ordered, enough salt to bring you to tears (salty, salty tears), and bread so hard it could safely do time in county.  My wife enjoyed her steak, so I'll tack an extra star on for that."}
{"text":"The only complaint ever about Texas Roadhouse is the line to get in.  Great steaks, this one is run well, it has a honky tonk atmosphere and they serve peanuts at the table, so if you don't like this atmosphere don't go.  They do great at what they do.  The staff has always been good when I was there, and they DO take reservations kind of if you call you can put yourself on the wait list.  I am normally too disorganized to do that.  One of my wifes FAVORITE restaurants (she would be offended I only gave it 4 stars)."}
{"text":"Coke - Always great this is a new location for us. Busy..  but service is good. Call ahead! Love the rolls and the smothered chicken and the sweet potatoes! But we all love this place. Saw that the ribs have the same calories as the fried pickles..... cool"}
{"text":"The first TR I tried was in Hickory, NC.  Perhaps it was because we were on vacation, visiting family, but I was initially enamored with the Texas theme and general country style friendliness. I loved the peanuts on the table, the plethora of TV screens blaring all manner of sports contests and the friendly waiters all coupled with a few beers and lots of laughter.  Having been a few more times, I still like the vibe but I can take it in small doses - occasionally.  Their steaks are pretty darn good and cooked to order but I can only take so much country music and cowboys."}
{"text":"We usually are big big fans of Texas Roadhouse and came out to Mesa to see friends so we recommended we go to the one by their house.   We came after the dinner rush and were told it would be about 15-20 minutes for our party of two families. We waited, and waited, and waited and after about 45 minutes we asked the hostess and she said they were waiting for the \"only place to seat us\". After another 10 minutes they sat half our party and another 10 minutes after that we all were finally seated.   Since we had waited so long we already knew what we wanted to order and put in the order right away. After 20 minutes the food came out and our California Chicken had molded out avocado on it and when we brought it to the waitresses attention she said \"what would you like me to do about it?\" and offered to scrape it off and bring us fresh avocado. The avocado didn't come in time to accompany the rest of the meal.   They were out of several things our party tried to order as well (which is tough to tell kids who have been waiting). Thank goodness there were rolls as that was singular highlight of our experience."}
{"text":"My first impression was clean wait was not that long at all. However, one set of silverware was very dirty but, the waitress quickly brought out a new set. But,  during our meal our waitress kept disappearing she would go chat to other waitress or just stand someplace else. If it was not for the manager I do believe our glasses would be empty. The rolls would have been gone as well. At the end she did bring us to go boxes but, she did not bring lids for the ranches. And when ask for them you could see her standing by the kitchen taking her time. At the end my husband had to go get the to go bag. Now on to the food it was pretty delicious 8 OZ ,steak, shrimp corn ,and was cooked to perfection. However , loaded baked potato was uncooked. The  next dinner 8oz steak, shrimp, rice and chili all cooked to perfection. The  appetizers we order were  the Cactus Blossom was overcooked but the Buffalo wings  were good.  Let's not forget about the rolls THEY WERE WONDERFUL!   MOIST ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"The food was gross so greasy and nasty ,the service was great they were very nice and kind ,you do get a lot of food too so that's nice"}
{"text":"On our way to LA from Texas and We just couldn't resist because you can't get this in So. Cal. It was great. The bread is soooo good. Had a little bit of everything. Ribs literally fell off the bone. Steak was perfect had the sautéed onions on top. I had the chili with cheese as a side. I just felt no onions woulda been better on chili because they over powered it. I think next time I'll go with a baked potato instead of mashed though. I can't wait to go back! The service was good too very friendly!"}
{"text":"Love this Texas Roadhouse.  Hate their parking.  There are not enough spaces, or enough room for driving through to look for a spot.  It's even worse for people picking up takeout.  There aren't any designated spots for takeout, and anyone who parks outside the entrance gets in the way of the already poor parking situation.  To expound the situation, for the 5-10 employees standing around doing nothing, you would think takeout orders would be ready when you get there.  Instead, it's like they don't even bother starting your order until you walk in to pick it up.  Then you have to wait for 1 of the 5-10 teenagers to find the 1 person who handles takeout and is allowed to pack your food and ring you up.  What the heck are the rest of the kids doing, other than standing around flirting with each other?  Our 15-20 minute timeframe is usually a 20 minute drive to get there, then another 35 minutes waiting for our order."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! I'm not much for chain restaurants but this is new to our area and we live so close we had to try it. First, if you're going to call yourself a steak restaurant then you better do steaks well, right?  They did! I had the 6 0z filet and it was done perfectly medium and hot the entire way thru. Husbands ny strip also perfectly cooked as well. We sat at the bar, we we're waited on right away and our food came our very quickly. We went early, around 4:30 and only one other couple was at the bar, within 1/2 hour the bar and entire restaurant was packed. It was a very good experience."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, but the wait is excessive and the noise level have me a headache. I'll avoid it on the weekends in the future. Was told 25 minutes when we got there, we checked after 20, \"10-15 more\", it ended up being 45 to be seated and 45 to be served. Too long!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed. The food is usually really good and most of the time the service is friendly & on point. Today we had a waitress that was so flaky! She clearly forgot to put our order in because people that arrived to the restaurant after we placed our order got their food before we did. Then when she split the check she tried to charge me for a steak I did not order. She was slow, flaky and talked way too much. It took us over an hour and a half to order, get our food & pay for it. We beat the lunch rush so there was no reason for this delay. I'll go back, but I will not sit in her section again."}
{"text":"Super disappointed tonight. Call ahead seating for 4. When we arrived, the hostess had our name wrong and then told us that it would be 5-10 mins. We waited at the bar literally 30 mins. When I went to the front to ask about the delay, I was told that they page us but had accidently registered two pagers and would seat us right away. We are taken to our table and its dirty and full of dishes. We said we were fine with sitting in the bar and rceicwd prompt service, however the food was awful. All 4 steaks were cold and my steak was MD. Rare when asked for MD well. The baked potatoes were overcooked and dry. Finally the end is near and we received our check. We asked to have the check split and our server messed up running the entire check on one card. She voided the transaction, but the pending charge will take 24 hours to drop off. Everything that could go wrong, went wrong. Happy Birthday, sorry the restaurant screwed up royally."}
{"text":"First time back in years & now I know why we stopped going..as soon as we are seated the booth seats are ripped & the foam is coming out. HORRIBLE service. Even my daughters ask where is the waitress.when she does show it's another bit of time just to get the drinks. And once again disappeared. In short mine & one daughter ribs over cooked - other daughters Mac and cheese ICE cold. That was a joke finding waitress to send back. Had to give it to another one to take back.1 star because the rolls are still good."}
{"text":"Really good buns and catfish but bartender is low quality and inattentive    Plus  the margaritas aren't good they are artificially flavored and certainly not classic by a landslide   I'm from Texas and I've never had a margarita that bad there"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday, but called ahead to place our name on the waiting list.  When I checked in was told 15 minutes at most.  25 minutes went by so checked in again and was told I had already been seated.  Our table was given to someone else.  The issue with this is why give me a pager if you were just going to call out my name inside, especially if we were waiting out side.  They got us seated in about 10 minutes after that.   I would have expected to get at least a courtesy drink or dessert for the delay, nothing.  The only good thing about the meal was the rolls, awesome.  The meals were medicore.  My daughters ribs were burnt bad and they did comp us for those.  Server was nice, but that did not make up for the meal or wait."}

{"text":"I'd love to give this place 4-Stars but they had issues with dirty forks and knives.  The setting at the table was dirty and I asked for a replacement; they brought me a different serving set with dried food on it...dam. Assuming you don't have this experience I suggest you try their half dinner portion because it's quite filling.  The pork chop was juicy, my side of corn was good, and the chili I ordered wasn't bad either.  I got to taste some of the other dishes too and liked the flavor of their six ounce steak and house salad.  All in all a great value at $38 for three dinners with drinks.  Side note, stay away from the peanuts on the table, they're not fresh and you'll want to leave room for the food."}
{"text":"I love Texas Roadhouse... usually. Unfortunately this location desperately needs to get with the program. They've been open for nearly 6 months now so things should be running smoothly now. Since opening, I've probably visited 6 or 7 times. I've tried desperately to give them the benefit of doubt but I think we'll travel to the Stapley location. The issues are poor customer service, wrong orders, and over cooked meat."}
{"text":"Hmm, first to review a restaurant that's been open for months  Anyway, Similar to Lone-star or Outback.  Reasonably good steaks at a fair price.  Mostly booths, don't like booths.  Don't like loud country music that much either.  Don't like the wait staff stopping to do line dances either, that may be my steak sitting under the heat lamp.  Steak was OK.   Compared to the nearby restaurants, probably last choice."}
{"text":"Nothing beats their ribs, so amazing every time!! Love their mashed potatoes!! Service is always great, good prices on drinks."}
{"text":"Like most Texas roadhouses, place is really noisy. In fact my ears were ringing for about a half an hour after we left. But I have to say I had one of the best prime ribs I have ever had in my life. It was cooked to perfection and I could cut it with a fork. Absolutely perfect. I would highly recommend it. I've had their bone in ribeye before, but this is the first time I've tried the prime rib and I'm glad I did. Our bartender was extremely polite and helpful. But I'd be surprised if he still has a voice or could hear anything after his shift. They really need to put some kind of noise dampening material in that place. If they would do that I would give it easily a five star rating"}
{"text":"We've been here well over a dozen times in the past few years and have been so disappoint this last time. Ribs were day old and dry and the sirloin tips were tough and hard to chew!"}
{"text":"It had been quite awhile since we ate here. My husband and I took our niece there for dinner 2 nights ago. We were seated promptly and warm yummy yeast rolls were waiting on the table for us. Our server had our drinks to us quickly as well. I ordered the sirloin steak (medium well) with salad and the loaded baked potato. I don't know if cheese, bacon, and sour cream counts as loaded, but it great. I didn't realize they put eggs on their house salads as most restaurants don't. I hate eggs so the young lady who brought our salads replaced my salad with an egg free salad quickly. My steak was think so it didn't get to the level of wellness I preferred. It was more like very medium. Our server offered to take it back and cook it a bit longer. Shortly she returned with the steak and another baked potato. The steak had no fat on it - which I love. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, TR! My good friend Troy Claudio used to cook for them, but I think at a different location. I have been here only a few times, but my boyfriend, my kids and I there last night and everything from food to service to atmosphere was such a delight."}
{"text":"Server, Robin was outstanding but the food was not. Order Joliet medallions with rice and veggies. Filet was very tough and fatty and the rice was super salty. Bread was very good and very hot. Restrooms were not clean."}
{"text":"Best place for a steak. The service is 5star. There is a server Timmy.. He is amazing . he should be management but then we wouldn't have him as a server. Great price. Always cooked perfect with great flavor."}
{"text":"One of my favorite meals is a good steak and a potato, and I must say, I have never been disappointed coming to the Texas Roadhouse. I love the peanuts at the table. I start eating some of those right away. Iced tea is good and they keep it filled up for me. I've never had a bad waitress here. They wear really skippy short shorts here, which doesn't bother me, just an observation. I imagine that for the guys to get the good tips? The rolls are pretty good, but I wait till the end to eat one due to the honey butter that comes with it. I don't like my sweet at the beginning, only at the end. :) I order my steak medium, and it came out flavorful and juicy. I eat the whole potato, skin and all, its so good. I have met the creepy balloon guy. He's just an old man trying to make a living, cut the guy a break. I just politely said no, I would not like a balloon and he went away. Pricewise, under $20 for lunch, which for a steak restaurant, not a bad deal. If you want that nice feeling of fullness after eating a good meal, I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"It's a typical chain restaurant. The steaks are good but the sides aren't very impressive."}
{"text":"Parking is a nightmare, took 20 minutes, another 20 to be seated at 8:30 on Saturday night, lead to table and left with a basket of cold buns, every teenager in town works there, stumbling over each other, server brought wrong drink, I waited for it to be replaced, she never came back, so I asked the gal who brought our boneless wings to replace it, wings were great, dinner was good, but didn't get sautéed mushrooms and onions for my steak, so I stopped the same girl to ask her for some, by the time they appeared steak was cold anyway.tried this location as we were hoping it would be better then arrowhead, but won't be back,"}
{"text":"Brought a friend here for lunch the other day.  I had not been to a Texas Roadhouse in over a year, maybe even longer, and all I remembered was the bread.  Oh and also the peanut shells you can throw on the ground.  Well the bread did live up to my memory of the wonderful warm fresh roll glazed with honey, and with a tub of sweet cinnamon butter to compliment it. It is so good that it sticks in your memory years later.  We both ordered salads, one caesar with chicken, and one chicken fritter salad.  I only ordered a salad because I had dinner plans later, so I wanted something light.  My friend enjoyed her caesar,  but I really thought mine was just okay.  It was basically chicken strips on some greens with cheese.  I will not order the chicken fritter salad again, I wish I had ordered the chicken fried steak or a filet instead. Something more substantial and satisfying.  The server was attentive, but almost to the point of intrusive.  He was a very nice guy, BUT he had asked us like every 2 mins if everything was alright.  It was a tad annoying, but I cut him some slack for trying to keep on top of things.  Other than that, I had no other problems with service.  This place is okay.  It is solid, and you really can't go wrong if you decided to settle on this venue over the many other dining options in the area.  Grade C"}
{"text":"Overall this place does a decent job.  That being said, it is super clear that pepper is their favorite ingredient.  I ordered a pork chop for dinner and it comes with a pepper sauce (thankfully on the side).  I chose sides of mashed potatoes and buttered corn.  The corn had so much pepper in it you could almost not see the yellow.  It barely tasted like corn at all and I couldn't eat much of it.  Our server was exceptionally friendly although really slow to bring things like butter or water refills out.  She did bring fresh rolls because she took so long to bring the requested regular butter.  Apparently they were having a server meeting in the kitchen and you can't leave the meeting even if you have a guest requesting something.  I don't think that is a good practice at all - your guest requests should come before a staff meeting.  All the servers had to do a line dance of sorts during dinner also and it was pretty clear none of them were jazzed about having to do it.  Seemed kinda hokey - something more appropriate for a bar in Mexico than a restaurant in Phoenix.  But back to the food, my pork chop was absolutely delicious and the mashed potatoes were very good also.  Only thing I would advise is lay off the pepper. And if your buttered corn is actually peppered corn, it should be advertised as such."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time recently and was pleasantly surprised. We got there about 8pm on a Friday night and the place was still packed. We only waited maybe 5 minutes to get a table which wasn't bad at all.   My date had the BBQ Chicken Sandwich with a side salad. While we were waiting for his salad to come out the server came over and said there was a mistake as he should have already receive his salad and it would be right up, which it was so not a huge deal. A few minutes later our meals came out. While he was hoping it was shredded chicken it was a chicken breast but said it was still quite tasty. I had the 10oz rib eye with sides of green beans and applesauce. The steak was cut perfectly and it was a perfect size portion. The green beans (which the server suggested) were awesome and the applesauce was a nice sweet finish so no dessert was needed. Another bonus is everything (steak, beans, applesauce) were all served on separate plates so no runny juices mixing all over the place which was perfect!!!!   The prices were very reasonable as well.   Overall, we both enjoyed Texas Roadhouse and will certainly be back."}
{"text":"We got there after they closed and they still gave us 2 boxes of Free bread!  You really cannot complain when you show up and Yelp said they were open but they were not and they give you a load of the yummy sweet buns...   Friendly Staff and tasty buns!"}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is a favorite!!!  Sweet tea is amazing Fresh buns are awesome Loaded sweet potatoes are the reason to be there! Steaks are even a 4 out of 5 stars to me!  A bit loud but a cool place and can accommodate groups and parties...  Worth a taste for sure, you will come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome Sweet Tea and Sweet Buns!  Reliable go to for decent steaks, awesome loaded sweet potatoes, properly made southern sweet tea and endless yummy buns and peanuts.   Cool environment, a bit loud but good.   Great for birthdays and get togethers.  Staff is usually outgoing and friendly.   Stop in for a feeding!"}
{"text":"Reliably Tasty Food & Good Service   Texas roadhouse is one of our reliable favorites for an easy getaway for a tasty piece of meat and a loaded sweet potato.  It doesn't really matter which state or city you are in, Texas roadhouse always delivers the same quality and good service with the exception of only one location that we ever went to that was terrible.  Our waitress at the bar was Shawna and she was very polite and nice and kept my sweet iced tea flowing all night long.  Texas roadhouse always has decent music, and lots and lots of people there. So if you're going to go on a Friday or Saturday call in for a reservation or show up there a little bit earlier than normal.  My only criticism of this location is that I wish my loaded sweet potato would've had a little bit more sweetness to it like most of the other times that I get it. It wasn't bad though.  Stop by and give them a taste!"}
{"text":"Boy oh boy was it packed tonight!!!! I wanted a steak dinner..  i know this place provides a good steak at a decent price.  We arrived at 5:42 pm and there was almost a 1 hr wait.  So we waited.  Talked with other people and enjoyed the outdoors. We were \"buzzed\" with the electronic thing and showed to our table.  It was wayy in the back in a corner. But since just 2 of us, It was okay this time.  The waitress came over, friendly, and on auto pilot it seems. Was too busy making het spiel to listen to my order.   It was loud and crowded. But still order came out correct. However the steak was lukewarm, the broccoli was good, the carrots undercooked.  Overall not too bad!!"}
{"text":"After waiting a long time (which is expected on a weekend) we get walked to our table and asked the unnecessary questions \"is this your first time here? When is the last time you were here\" blah blah blah. We get sat in the waitress' section and she takes about 10 minutes to get our drink order, mind you she only had 3 tables...including ours. Well it turns out she knew the people at one of the tables because she spent a lot of time talking to them. By the time our food got to the table, our drinks were empty. She left them empty, she asked if we needed something else, we told her what we needed, she was gone for at least 10 minutes and came back with nothing. My husband had to take all of our empty cups to the bar for a refill. My steak was over cooked but that wasn't my biggest complaint, it was Anna our \"server\" she was horrible."}
{"text":"Good steak, cooked right, with great service. Our waitress was very nice, my salad was great, my baked potato was great and my steak was excellent. The beer was cold and the bread was good as ever. My only complaint was the Texas Chili I ordered was cold. We were here on a Monday night around 08:30pm and it was pretty busy"}
{"text":"This was the first time I had the pleasure of going to the Texas Roadhouse.  We took a friend there for his birthday and the steaks were excellent.  Factor in the fact that I had one of the best loaded sweet potatoes I've ever had in my life and I would highly recommend the Texas Roadhouse to anyone!  The ambience and service were excellence.  I really can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I love their Ribeyes & the fact that they carry an IPA on Tap. They forgot me on their Roadhouse App :(. My ribeye was a bit thin, but very tasty and cooked to order.  The service was excellent, and the food was delivered fast."}
{"text":"My second time at a Texas Roadhouse and bf's first time. We were craving BBQ and this is where we ended up.  First things first, the server was great. She was fairly new but she was attentive and made sure we were okay.  Atmosphere was great. Probably the busiest restaurant we've been to in Madison so far...and it was on a Wednesday night. A few birthday celebrants as well so it got louder from time to time. Yeeehaw!!!  He ordered the full rack of ribs with butter added on the mashed potatoes and a side of vegetables. He said the meat was very tender and easily came off the bone. I thought the ribs at Lucille's (BBQ restaurant in California) was better, but he disagreed and gave this one two thumbs up. Still tasty to me though. He loves mashed potatoes and adding the butter on this one tasted even better for him. Got a few bites and I agreed.  I ordered the BBQ chicken and shrimp combo with caesar salad and steak fries. Caesar salad was good but a little too much dressing. Steak fries were plentiful and yummy! BBQ chicken wasn't too out of this world but the shrimp was my favorite. Next time I'll just order that on its own if I can.  One of the places we've been where we left very satisfied and have nothing to complain about.  No dessert this time around but we'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great oven roasted chicken! I couldn't believe how good it was for a corporate chain. I'm sure it wasn't health food, but, how bad can oven roasted chicken and broccoli with no butter be? I'd go back to this location if I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Great service , the food is awesome, try the Dom Nico w) mushrooms n grilled onions!! The restaurant has the best management, I have ever experience, very well DN, under z!!"}
{"text":"I normally love Texas Roadhouse and I am A regular customer. I don't always order to go though. Last time I ordered a to go order they forgot my drinks and I mentioned it to them. I went back today and again they forgot my to go drinks. Instead of them apologizing for forgetting again once I mentioned it, Lauren (who is a team lead who I thought was being very rude honestly) her response was \"oh no one ever gets drinks to go that's why\"... instead of her saying \"oh I'm so sorry let me get your drinks\" that was her response.   They need to hire a WAY nicer manager.  Anthony is a nice manager, Lauren on the other hand, very rude. Makes me not want to come back to this location, unfortunately."}
{"text":"I love Texas Roadhouse but I'm so disappointed with my visit tonight. We specifically asked for a table (no booth) and they put us in a booth a stuck a chair at the end. It wasn't like they were so busy a table wasn't available.  More important....how do you run out of baked potatoes AND sweet potatoes by 8pm on Saturday? You're open until 11pm!!! Someone failed at their job. So disappointed.  On top of that, no one came by to fill our beverages. Even after we asked no one came by. The bucket of peanuts was empty and we had an empty ketchup bottle."}
{"text":"Out of all the chains; Longhorn, Outback, and Roadhouse I think Roadhouse has the best quality of meat. Which is why we go out for steak, isn't it?  I had the prime rib and it was as tender as any I've had. I was disappointed with the \"fresh\" horseradish they served. Mostly water and little old. I'm guessing not to many people ask for it. Loaded potato was very good. My date had the filet. Why anyone want a boring steak I will never understand but it was cooked perfect for her. And that's what counts. Great service, especially for a Sunday after church let's out.   Only big Negative was the peanuts were very Very stale. They really should check and replace or get rid of them all together if your not."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for an early dinner tonight. I had some dietary requests. When the food got to our table one of the requests were not met. I decided to just accept it the way it came. When our waiter Colby came to check on us a few minutes later he noticed, and insisted that he get it fixed. A few minutes later the manger showed up and apologized for the error. WOW guys! this is what Old Fashioned Customer Service is all about. Thank you for a enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"Went here with a party of six last night. Reservations are a must on a Friday night, and we skipped past a full waiting room. You must have at least six in your party to \"reserve\" a table.  The ribs were delicious, and, as other have described them, fall off the bone tender. My wife's ribeye was too salty, but they quickly brought out another when we told the waitress. We had ordered a combo meal, with a 12 oz ribeye and some ribs, and this was more than enough for the two of us. In fact, all of us ended up bringing home leftovers for the next day's lunch.  Our waitress was very attentive. She also participated in a staff led line dance next to our table. They made my son-in-law's birthday special with their birthday saddle and free ice-cream.  We all had bought drinks, and shared two appetizers, but still got out of there for under $120, including the tip.  I'm just taking off one star because it was very loud."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants. We've never had a bad meal here. The steaks are very tender, the portions are good size and the staff couldn't be nicer. It was packed tonight but with call ahead service we didn't have to wait too long. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and the food came in very late. I think they should be more organized and train their servers to be nicer overall."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Love New york strip omg"}
{"text":"Got the 14oz boneless Rib eye and a add on Rack of ribs. The ribs were okay, a little dry and the BBQ sauce was mediocre.  The steak was nearly a third fat but it tasted good, except maybe a bit on the salty side. Decent everyday quality cut."}
{"text":"It's always a hit or miss here. My husband almost always share a full slab of ribs and ask for them to be well well done. One time we got them and they were still kind of slimmie. We couldn't finish eating them so we just ate our sides. Other times they're perfect,  but my husband is tired of not knowing when we'll have a good meal.   Make sure to call ahead and make a reservation if its on the weekend if not you'll be waiting quite a while."}
{"text":"We ate here two Saturdays in a row and it was fantastic both times! Great service, fair pricing, and some of the best Filet Mignon I have ever had! There's usually a wait on weekends but it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"We went in tonight and had a great experience! We did the call ahead seating, which again is ONLY call ahead seating. This is not a reservation, even if you call ahead, you'll probably still have a short wait.  We called ahead and were told 25-35 minutes. We got there about 30 minutes later and only waited 10 more minutes and in those 10 minutes we enjoyed a beer :)  JB was our server and he was excellent, I had some concerns about the steak options and he made great recommendations. Kept our drinks full and had a smile the entire time!  We will definitely be back soon and we will be requesting JB's section!"}
{"text":"Came in on Veterans day, fast service and delicious food even with a packed house! My kids always enjoy conning here"}
{"text":"My husband had the rib eye and said it was good.  I had the filet with shrimp.  Filet was pretty good but shrimp was just ok.  Wait staff is nice but its a very busy place."}
{"text":"This location is ALWAYS super clean and super friendly with excellent quality food. We always get the prime rib and it rivals any great steakhouse with their meat quality! The rolls are also a main reason for going, they're so delicious! They also have call ahead seating which is so convenient. Every time we come here our service is always top notch, everyone is so friendly and our food always comes out so fast and always amazing. This place must be managed VERY well because it shows. This location is not the closest one to where I live but we always drive because this location is truly the best!!!"}

{"text":"I really like the Texas Roadhouse.  They try to make your dining experience fun.  The people that work there always seem tot be in a good mood.  The food is great.  Ribs are the best around.  Fall off the bone like advertised.  Steaks are large and sides are large portions.  No complaints.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hadn't been in a while and we were craving some BBQ and with some of the other bbq joins being closed already this place popped in my head. I got the chicken fried chicken with a side of chili."}
{"text":". Always busy on a Friday night so get there early.   20 min wait turns into 45 min wait. Mixed up orders and over cooked steak. You would think a steak house could get it right the first times. Comes backs e come time and it's cold to the touch and even the grease has hardened on top."}
{"text":"Had a great time here with a friend! Customer service was excellent and on top of our needs. We were greeted upon entering and wished a goodnight when we left. Our wait time was reasonable and food was delicious. I will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here twice and we have been disappointed both times. We live here in Surprise and would love to make this our local hang but the quality of their food has left us wondering what's going on in the kitchen.  We love Texas Roadhouse but we will continue to drive to the I17 and Peoria location."}
{"text":"Grabbing lunch with my wife.....bbq sauce everywhere! I love a good steak and although this is a chain style restaurant their steaks are consistent as is the rest of the meal! My favorite location is at Metro Center, although we do stop in at the Arrowhead location from time to time."}
{"text":"FREE peanuts (albeit a little stale?) are great!  Onion blossom, too much coating and boring dipping sauce - NOT a blooming onion.  Salad, blue cheese dressing with little character.  Country fried top sirloin, sodium overload covered with a bland white gravy!  Baked potato, nothing special.  Might want to order a more classic steak?   Desserts, nothing special going on here - might want to thaw the cheese cake?  Service - not very attentive and our large party of 8 was seated in a long deep booth that requires food and drink be passed down the table.  Not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had birthday dinner for my granddaughter and all I can say is I doubt I will come back.  I had salmon and sweet potato.  By the time I arrived home I was deathly sick and spent the entire night in the bathroom.  I contacted them the next day and have still heard nothing back. Poor customer service if you ask me.  The only reason they are getting 2 stars is because the rolls were yummy and our server was great."}
{"text":"Best prime rib you will ever have! Fun atmosphere and awesome service. The bread and sweet cinnamon butter is amazing too. Best part is you can throw your peanut shells all over the floor. :) My husband and I love this place and it makes for a great/fun night out."}
{"text":"Below average service, solid food.  I am mildly disappointed about the chili. They used to be beanless which made this place heavenly for me... but times have changed. It's a standard steakhouse chain but it's good food. The ribeye was very juicy and you can't go wrong with the dinner rolls with whipped cinnamon/sugar butter.  I'd say the food is a solid 4 for a chain, but the service we received today was not exactly on a par with other restaurants. One of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to being waited on is not clearing tables.... Especially when other tables around are getting cleared. Don't get me wrong, our waitress was nice, but for some odd reason she was refusing to clear our appetizer and salad bowls. We even stacked them for her and she still refused to take them. She comes to our table with three plates of steaks and makes some joke about how she's playing Tetris (while still not clearing).  You see, the objective of Tetris is to clear rows. As real life analogy, the waitress/staff are supposed to clear plates. If you don't, blocks/plates accumulate making it harder to manage. So we ate at an unnecessarily crowded/cluttered table the entire time.   She also forgot my fathers beer and blamed it on the bar. Other servers were bringing it to their patrons. No sense of accountability is very very off putting to me.  Although we enjoyed the food, the staff did not meet essential functions. I waitressed before and I was taught that that kinda of negligence does not fly... not that any does. Oh she also cleared the salad bowls of the table behind us. Fishy fishy. She thought I wouldn't notice. I've considered maybe she got overwhelmed, but then I see her chatting with her colleagues as if taking a salad bowl and two chili cups is a boat load of work."}
{"text":"How do you get a great seat at Texas Roadhouse?  You sit at the bar and eat.  Kristin is a great bartender,  she makes sure your happy with your order, and you can watch  the game while you eat at the bar . The food is excellent, the atmosphere is great, the servers care and the cost is reasonable.  I've had cattleman's, Black Angus, but nothing beats a Texas Roadhouse  Fillet or Prime Rib.                                                                Note I would not recommend sitting children at the bar because there is adult talking.  ps I just moved out of state to Citrus Heights CA can you guys build a Texas Roadhouse here please. One in Roseville CA maybe?"}
{"text":"As others have stated, really loud!  Went for a birthday and we sat and looked at each other as we couldn't hear each other talk. Ok, the service was bad, Becky took our order, someone else delivered, Becky came buy just after to check on us.  We hadn't time to check our steaks yet. She disappears, never to be seen again.  One of the steaks was ordered medium and came out really well done.  I had to go to the bar twice to get more water.  Lots of staff, but no one came to the table and they were gathered in groups away from us.  Yes, I thought about hollering over the music to get someone's attention, but by then it was easier to get up from the table and walk to the bar to get a refill. I finally had to grab a waiters attention as he walked by and asked him to find our waitress so we could have the check.  We sat near the bar area, so at least I could watch some football as we couldn't talk to each other. I won't be back."}
{"text":"My fiance and I decided to stop by for dinner yesterday afternoon. Let me begin with stating that this restaurant's level of customer service is OUTSTANDING. I reached out to them to inquire about wait times & reservations and they responded right away. They were very helpful & informative. The app was easy to use and once we arrived, we were seated almost immediately. We had prime rib (medium rare) with a side of rice and sauteed onions & t-bone (medium) with a side of the loaded mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms. Both were absolutely DELISH!!!! The hostess was very pleasant and our server Rachel was just AWESOME!!!!! Honestly, there were SEVERAL servers that were awesome by stopping by and making conversation. It added to the experience! The food was on point, the service was stellar, and the vibes were just right!! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"In a city where an ice cold Shiner Bock is hard to find, I thought for sure I could count on Texas Roadhouse to have it. Not so much. I'm still dumbfounded. However, for a chain, this place ain't bad. My steak was cooked just as ordered (medium) and it was very tender. I love how the mashed potatoes come loaded and the rolls with cinnamon butter are good.  I'm not sure if Logan's Roadhouse is a knockoff or if they're in the same family or what, but I think Texas Roadhouse does everything just a little bit better, including the ambiance. Not bad. I'd rather come here again than Outback or something else comparable.  Just don't try and get me to do any line dancing when it's one of the many birthdays you're likely to see here."}
{"text":"The ambience of this place is so lively  Upon arrival we were seated in less than 2 minutes and our server took our drink orders She's a sweetheart  Peanuts with buckets and bread and butter are complimentary and they're good  Server brought me another coke and I'm not done with my first one, she is prompt I ordered the 6oz sirloin and for sides I chose chili and fries... There are a ton of people here for a Sunday My guess is that it is mostly families that got out of church  This area is a very family oriented area  My meal was very good and very filling The steak was cooked very well  Medium The chili was actually very good and I gobbled it down in a heartbeat The steak fries were good too Oh I got the steak smothered in mushrooms too and it was yummy  Our server really made the visit great She was nice and very prompt It amazes me how servers can remember drink orders and food orders for like their whole section... She was great!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!! Can be a long wait, but you can call ahead and out your name in. Totally worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great service and even better food. Best bread and cinnamon butter out there!"}
{"text":"I know. It's a chain. But why do you think there's always a line out the door? They do everything well. Yes, it's the Olive Garden and Applebee's crowd, so food snobs need not apply. But if you want predictably excellent, well prepared everything, this is a good bet. We use the carryout option often, because it's close to Waite Hill. But we could also hang at the bar, as the service is always excellent. Just don't tell anybody you saw us there"}
{"text":"We go here just about every Sunday after church. We moved a year ago from update (Albany) NY area and they had just opened one that we did not care for so we were hesitant to go here but my brother insisted as he goes all the time. We are no hooked on the place. We don't make it as much after church now as we go in the other direction but we are still close enough to go when we can. Servers are great, prices are very reasonable for what they give you."}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving steak, so we thought we could come here for dinner.....bad mistake. We came in around 9:30 pm and was sitted right away. We were served with a lightly buttered roll with cinnamon butter, and peanuts (both free). The steak was good and cheap! Everything was good except our waitress. She was friendly, but really inattentive! She came to our table only two times! First time to take our order and second time to give us our bill. She didn't even serve us the food, a bus boy did. I don't mind whoever serves us our food, but I do mind that our server was chatting away with other servers across the restaurant. She thought we didn't see her, but we did. For the whole duration of our meal our server did not even pass by once! My water glass was EMPTY and my chilli did not come out until I pointed it out when she came by to give us our bill. HORRIBLE SERVICE!  Overall,  Food: 4 stars Service: 0 star"}
{"text":"Good service with big portion great tasting food. You definitely get your moneys worth. Plenty to choose from on their menu."}
{"text":"We went out to dinner here last night.  It was busy, but we were seated quickly! Our waitress had a great personality and awesome service! Everyone's steak came out to order, the fries were not fresh but was quickly corrected!"}
{"text":"World's worst experience. Music blasting so where you cannot even talk or hear yourself think. The waitress says oh it's the way we do things. People screaming and yelling trying to talk over music. Very disruptive unable to even enjoy a meal here. Would not recommend it to a dog catcher"}
{"text":"I'm so tired of coming here and having the hostess act rude and snobby to have my food fucked up every time recently never cook my steaks so why even bothering asking how I want it cooked same with my baked potatoes just gonna drive to a different location next time done with this bs."}
{"text":"Ok. I have been here 3 times and same problems every time. The cook takes no pride in what he serves. My chicken looked and tasted like it was 3 days old, lettus was old. I'm a Texas road house fan, but not this  one. I give up, never going back."}
{"text":"Likes: Everything!  Dislikes: The wait, but bring something to do or call ahead and you will be completely satisfied!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place! Best grilled chicken salad I've ever had and the hot rolls and cinnamon butter are always a hit!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service by Kristin. Very attentive made sure we got everything we ordered.  Steak was fork tender."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is our \"go to\" restaurant. Usually love the food, but every once in a while, it doesn't meet all our expectations. The service is generally good, unless we sit at the bar. We've never had a good experience when we sit at the bar. The servers are pretty attentive, while the bartenders are really not. Have to love the rolls and cinnamon butter!"}
{"text":"I have stopped recently taking the family to Texas Roadhouse due to the constant 45min wait to get a table.  I know why they are busy, good consistent food at reasonable prices.   Well we had time to kill so we came Sunday evening.  Normal long wait.  We got our table and server promptly got our drinks and biscuits.  It took nearly 30minutes from the time we ordered our food to actually get it.  There was only 4 of us.  Normally they are faster.  Everything was pretty on part for the norm except my half slab of ribs was dry and had nearly no sauce.  Pretty dissapointed.  It was an average experience at best."}
{"text":"If you've read a few of my reviews you would know that I don't frequent or recommend many franchise restaurants. But Texas Roadhouse is one of the few. I've probably been to 8 different locations in 5 different states and the service has always been good, the steak cooked the way I ordered and the value excellent. And this location is no exception. Our server was great, food was tasty and well prepared and the call ahead seating made our wait, oh, about a minute!"}
{"text":"Fabulous Caesar salad,  steak fries and Filet.   Alexis at the bar is super sweet and great service.  And she said MERRY CHRISTMAS!   Atmosphere is great and busy.   Lots of TVs with sports."}
{"text":"You just can't beat this location.  They really know customer service and great food."}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant and this location. There is usually a wait, however you usually never have to wait more than 15-20 min on busiest nights. Their food is always super delicious. Those rolls!! Need I say more! The food comes out fast. My husband and I have been to this location at least 20 times. Yum!"}
{"text":"The worst service I ever had, we reached there at 10 and they were suppose to close at 11, I ordered sirloin med rare and my gf ordered fillet med well, I got mine rare and her's med rare. My server took forever to clean up my table and handed me my check when my gf wanted to order the desert, server never bothered to ask us if we wanted dessert. When I called her back and ordered dessert she brought that in to go container saying that I asked her to bring in to go container. I felt so unwelcomed, y would I order dessert to go when we both were there and we live 30mins away, by the time we got back brownie was stone cold and ice-cream melted thanks for to go container. Save your money and time the one in Elyria is way much better."}
{"text":"Where do I start... I love this place!!!   I can't believe I'm just writing a review. This is by far one of my fave places to go to that's close to home.  The food is always made exactly how I ordered and it is always quick to come out. The bread and butter they give us is flippin amazing. Yes yes I know too much carbs, but every bite is worth it.  Last night we sat at the bar and Ian was our bartender. He was super friendly, attentive, and was  able to deliver great customer service. The mugs they use for beers on draft are the best because they are super chilly and keeps the beer at a perfect temperature :)  You must try this location! Just a heads up they do get very busy so if you can call ahead or if you don't have the kiddos go straight to the bar no waiting to get seated.   Honestly the wait doesn't even bother me because I know I will have a good experience."}
{"text":"Steak and delicious bread is the reason this is one of my favorite spots to eat! They have locations all over the valley and have a variety of foods on their menu. I usually always go for the filet mignon and they always cook it exactly how i like it. You can choose from 2 sides and my go to is the house salad with ranch, and i don't know why but this salad is so tasty even though it's an average salad. I mentioned their bread and it's a nice perk that they bring these out to you as soon as you sit down with butter that must be spread on your roll! I promise you won't be disappointed you will only leave being addicted to their rolls."}
{"text":"I have zero complaints.  The service is always fast and friendly. The atmosphere is cool and laid back and their steaks are ohhh so delicious! This is our favorite steak spot. We just try nor to get so full off of their hot rolls and sweet butter"}
{"text":"I love it so much I'm on my way now while the doors are opening up. The manager was cool and down to earth. Staff super friendly and attentive. I have always been well taken care of when I'm at Texas Roadhouses"}
{"text":"Yes, they're a chain, but the food was great and the service was exceptional.   I wasn't the only person to mention that the bartender (Jamie) is an invaluable employee."}
{"text":"No matter what, the rolls and honey butter are 2nd to none.  Also, I don't think I've ever had a bad salad here.  Unfortunately, that's where the goodness ends.  The steak was dry and lacked seasoning, and our service was lackluster.  I don't mind the country music, but the shouting / screaming / dancing for someone's birthday just needs to stop - and I don't just mean here."}
{"text":"What do you do in a failing economy next to a failing mall? You blow up the old Benigens and open a new TX Roadhouse. ??  I think I saw Patrick Swayze there too? j/k  The service was nice a tad slow but nice. The food was good, prices were good.  I had the pork sandwich which did not disappoint. In fact if fed me and my kid. The free bread is better with the normal butter not the flavored one. IMO  The do an annoying yet entertaining dance thing every 1/2 hr or so.. it was fun to watch the first time."}
{"text":"We went here for my husbands birthday on Saturday night. We were pleased we could call ahead and get a pager number 20 minutes before we arrived which only led to a 15 minute actual wait time. The place is loud as usual, so if you are looking for something intimate this is not the right place for you on the weekend. The ribs are simply the best, they are like BBQ pot roast, fall right off the bone and the loaded mashed potatoes are just the right size portion for me. Make sure you ask for extra caesar dressing on the side if you get one, as sometimes they do not have as much as I would like. Our server was very speedy and even with a very full station she was right on time to get us drinks and check in. If you order ribs and steak like we do you will pay about 80.00 for a family of four, but the food is very good!"}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is probably one of my favorite places to eat at when I come to Arizona. I really come here for the bread rolls with cinnamon butter. It reminds me of Hawaiian sweet rolls, but way better because they are warm and fresh. Our table got about 5 baskets of them.   For the entree, I ordered the 16oz ribeye to share with someone. It comes with 2 sides of your choice. I chose the mashed potatoes with white gravy and Caesar salad. The mashed potatoes were very good but I felt like the Caesar salad was bland even though I could see the dressing on the leaves of lettuce. The steak on the other hand was perfect. I ordered it medium and it was cooked perfectly and was so tender and juicy with the outside seared to perfection. I've had average steaks here before but I thought this time, it was cooked perfectly. I would definitely order it again. If I wasn't so full off the bread rolls, I would have been able to finish all 16oz! But too bad I had too much bread.   If I had the experience that I've had before with the steak being a little dry, I would have gave this place a 3. But I think this visit was really good because the steak was surprisingly cooked very well so I would give this place a 4."}
{"text":"This place is always busy, but that is a good thing cause you know the food is going to be good. Don't go in starving though cause you know it will be a bit before you get your seat or food. Once your at a table though it is fast, friendly, and just a good place to go grab a steak and beer."}
{"text":"Service was great. There was no wait to be seated, no wait for the server, and food arrived fast. I had a steak and ribs combo with broccoli and sweet potato. The food was delicious."}
{"text":"At six pm on a Saturday evening our party of eight had to wait one hour for a table. The staff was nice and efficient and, the food was great. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I am so impressed with our server and our service! We got here at 9:45. Never once did she make us feel badly for coming in late. Food was perfectly cooked and came out fast. Even though they where closing the restaurant was still pretty full. And all the servers where happy."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I usually sit at the bar when I go, bartenders are super sweet and very attentive. I love the atmosphere of this place!"}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is my favorite steak house.  I really appreciate them even more on Veteran's Day, thank you very much for the steak dinner, green beans (amazing with plenty of bacon!) and an tasty side salad with chunk bleu cheese dressing.  Jordan provided excellent service keeping the diet coke full and clearing the dishes during my meal.  Many Thanks!"}
{"text":"Seriously love this place!!!!! this location is one of the best locations to eat at I always get a super nice server which makes the experience even better!!!!"}
{"text":"Used to go to this place on Friday nights after work for some drinks and food around 7:30 to be exact (after traffic/rush hour).  Everything was awesome until they stopped making prime rib.  About a month ago, went there and ordered prime rib, but the excuse was that a someone had a party and everyone ordered prime rib within the party.  It's understandable in a way, but at the same time, if hosting a party, you'd think a place would prepare a little better for the party guests and for the other patrons coming in as well.  Tried it again a couple weeks later, same thing, all out of prime rib, except no party.  The week after, again, out of prime rib and the waitress/waiter said that I should of came in sooner than 7:30.  Well, I would if I or my friends didn't have any other responsibilities and if we all lived close by.  So, to my conclusion, they must not make prime rib anymore, because they're always out.  Great steak, but anyone can grill and prime rib takes hours to make, hence I always order it.  The Keg on Tatum and 101 still has prime rib at 10 PM, maybe even Firebirds next door.  Other solution is Logans on I-17 and Happy Valley."}
{"text":"My wife and I were out to dinner trying to celebrate our Anniversary. Things were going well until I found a long black hair in my potatoes...gross.  I get that things happens, but I think the problem was that the manager seemed put out by the fact that I asked her to take my plate away. I had only had one or two of the ribs on the rack and they didn't replace the plate...I assumed they'd at least take the rib dinner off the bill being that they threw majority of it in the trash. Instead I get a $5 discount with an uber tacky memo reading \"hair in pot\"...I'll go to outback next time.  We've been to Texas Roadhouse many times and never had this kind of service...it was our first and last time at this location however."}
{"text":"Usually get good service here but not today. Stephan was our server and paid little attention to us."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is always one of our favorite spot to eat, drink and socialize.  First visit to Happy Valleys TRH.  We were not disappointed.  Allie the waitress was very professional and helpful.  Our food was hot, cooked to the correct request and plenty of it.  Hubby stated the catfish needed to be cooked longer but taking it home and reheating can solve the problem.  4 of us left happy, satisfied and pleased.  Going at 3 pm it is quiet and not crowded. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner, service, and entertainment at this Roadhouse.  Visiting Phx is always fun but completion of a 5 day mini vacation with 7 people can be a hassle.  Not tonight, we were welcomed with smiles, quickly sat, and waitress allowed us to order kids meal first, served and then the adults meals.  She never missed a step.  Every meal was really well prepared, eye pleasing and tasty.  The dancing of employees was so much fun and kept us cheerful.  I highly recommend this establishment.  Thank you for doing what other business forget, pamper your clients."}
{"text":"Noisy,terrible food,bad waiters/waitresses .burnt ribs covered with bbq sause. Please  dont go there."}
{"text":"My first visit to the Texas Roadhouse in Peoria, AZ was a bitter experience.  Even after calling the day before to reserve seating for a party of 13 it still took over 40 minutes to seat us.  Most of us ended up at the bar eating peanuts and drinking cocktails.  Our bartender,  I won't mention her name, was very attentive and nice.  When the time to be seated came our party (it was my Grand daughters 21st birthday) they led us to a booth with a second small table on the end that seated 9.  The other 4 party guests sat at another table across from us.  What kind of restaurant can't accommodate a large group?  It would have been nice to have been told this when the reservations were made!  Service was substandard as our waitress was overwhelmed by the number of tables she was working. This also made our experience disappointing.  Now on to the food.  The salads, both House and Caesar, were good.  12 of the guests had steaks, which ranged from excellent to slightly undercooked (better then overcooked)!   While my BBQ ribs were fall off the bone, they were extremely dry, leathery and somewhat burnt.  Interesting and sad since these were supposed to be \"award winning\" as was the bland Chili side dish the grand kids had.  Guess it all depends on who is giving the award!  Our Steak fries came late and very hot with a little to much seasoning on them.  The baked sweet potato received several thumbs up!    Overall, or in a peanut shell, the food was average,  the service lacked, and the seating for a large party was totally unacceptable!  I don't expect to return again, but if I do it won't be with a group of 4 or more!"}
{"text":"The rolls are divine and you can't beat the price of the sirloin steak.  It's usually well cooked and flavorful.  I always enjoy it, and when I need a steak but don't want to spend a lot of money this is where I come.  There are some downsides to this restaurant but it's a chain and many of the downsides are expected.  Rushed service, sticky menus, inconsistent sides.    All in all I appreciate Texas Roadhouse when I have the hankerin' for a moderately priced steak."}
{"text":"Was super disappointed they didn't dance once in the entire hour plus we were there. Although the food and service was excellent. Part of why we look forward to coming here is the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Displeased with Janelle's solution to our invalid wait and grossed out by how her dark hair waving everywhere when it should've been pulled back since working with food and could easily contaminate any meal with a hair - she rudely ignored us and pushed to the side, making us feel unwelcome."}
{"text":"I would have given it FIVE STARS- but removed TWO stars for the server, service. Usually I get their dinners for pickup/take out only. I really enjoy the food, it is quite good and never have had a bad meal.  My first Dine In experience is my LAST dine in experience, ditto for my diner-mates, as it was their first T.R. experience and they were turned off.  First, we (three adults) were seated in the \"Noisy loud children and families\" section and in the VERY furthest seating all the way to the back and in a corner. We were not asked where we would like to be seated, and whether this seating was fine (it was not).  The ambience: depressing. The very large and loud family seated next to us (no fault of the restaurant of course) after finishing their meal, got a To-Go box and literally scraped every last crumb, crust, and condiment left on plates into the boxes to take home. I noticed another table unrelated was doing the same- I mean scraping off every little crumb.   Our server was a way too familiar. She spoke to us as if we were close friends and often interrupted our tables conversations without asking for her advice or help.  Our table was in the midst of deciding what to order while our server waited beside us (we're fast orderers by the way, I already knew what I wanted) I urged my friend to \"get their mashed potatoes and brown gravy, they're dreamy\" the server then butted in and said she (and I quote) \" I mixes [sic] up my mashed potatoes and the rice together and eat it up, it's so goooood\"  ... I told my friend \"well, this is the first time I've ever been repulsed from ordering something on the menu, by the waitress!\" We received our dinners just fine, everything was fine. Server comes back- \"is everything ok?\" Yes, yes everything's fine.. Waitress : It's GOOD, huh?!\" she pronounced \"good\" like \"geeeuuud\". and nodded her own head up and down at us energetically.   The whole atmosphere of the place, and the server, gave our table a sad and pathetic feeling, like we were there just to get \"filled up\" and were lucky not only were we receiving food, but LOTS of it.  Just sad and I felt dirty and icky when we left. Dining is supposed to be a fun, happy and better experience than what you get at home, not lower.  What's bad is, Texas Roadhouse probably will have no idea that their servers are like this, and probably won't care they lost at least two diners. Me, I will continue to order, but only TO GO orders, never dine in."}
{"text":"I normally don't go to chain restaurants although Texas is still one of my favorites! I went here with my co-workers for our holiday party. (Yes it's Feb) Our server, Kim did an awesome job, made sure we got everything we needed. I ordered grilled salmon with Caesar salad and steak fries. Portions are huge and prices are cheap! I love the free peanuts especially their bread! The best bread ever. The 2000 calories were worth it!"}
{"text":"My son and I ordered road kill. Mine was supposed to NOT have mushrooms. When it came to me it was SMOTHERED with mushrooms. My son ordered Road Kill medium rare. It actually came out as ROAD KILL! He waited over 15 minutes for his reorder"}
{"text":"Very good food here! Pretty good staff, though some waitresses there are a bit too ignorant and rude, overall experience isn't bad when you get past the greet counter in front."}
{"text":"Went to TXRDHS and ordered the ribs and sweet potato and my sexy bearded husband (SBH) ordered the chicken tenders, the big boy plate. We had a really great time and had an even better server named Septembre. She was on it and a lot of fun...thanks girlfriend for making our experience super fantastic. My ribs were ridiculous and I ate every last bite and wanted to lick the plate, but I refrained. They were juicy, smothered in tangy yet sweet goodness, and they fell off the bone. I'm clapping for their BBQ master as I type. The SBH really enjoyed his chicken as well. However he said his fries were super dry, and they were kinda whak. Which was ironic because for his two sides he ordered a side of fries, and a side of fries. Although when he went to the restroom I did sneak a few fries and I thought they were just right. (Yes, I'm that person who does that:))  Overall it was a good experience, a fun environment and a place that will for sure make your tummy smile."}
{"text":"Food is really good here.  Bread and cinnamon butter are excellent.   The last three times here they are out of prime rib.   I guess you need to get here about 3:00 for dinner.  Waitress took a smoke break halfway through our meal.  Was a little in incident since we just ordered drinks.  Overall good food, good atmosphere and hit or miss on the Servixe."}
{"text":"The food is pretty darn good along with the atmosphere. The bread they bring over with the butter (I think some kind of honey butter) it's good !! The service is good and a fun place to be at. A lot too choose from on the menu,decent prices. The prime rib is really good. If your into that, the steaks are really good. Good service,good prices & over all good and worth a visit, if you haven't tryed it yet."}
{"text":"After waiting 25 minutes to get our food and it came out cold, I am disappointed in this Texas Roadhouse restaurant.  I have eaten at least 25 times at this location.  Anytime that i have ordered a steak, at least half the meat was fat.  Texas Roadhouse used to be one of my favorite restaurant chains. Not anymore!  Hoping things would get better but only kidding myself.  Yesterday, I looked up the Texas Roadhouse hours to find that the rating on Yelp for this restaurant was three stars. Now I know why!"}
{"text":"Way too noisy over priced for the quality Space cadets for waiters I'll skip this place"}
{"text":"The best bang for your buck!  You like steak?  You like eating out?  You don't have much money to spend?  Here you go!  My family loves this place.  I'd definitely go there anytime I want to eat out at a good restaurant but not ready to splurge."}
{"text":"Have tried several steak houses within 5 miles of here looking for a great ribeye and a baked potato worthy of a review, as always tracks road house has cone thru again!!! Molly the bartender was very a tentative the entire time I was there even though it was a crowded Friday night!"}
{"text":"True, you throw your peanut shells on the floor. And yes, my Asian family has gotten some curious looks when we've ventured here.   ALL worth it. Great steaks, the sides that come with the meal are SMASHING, and the sweet bread rolls and cinnamon butter? Those are worth the trip alone, for reals. The portions are huge - and you know how sometimes food tastes worse when made in large quantities at restaurants? everything is still really good (I recommend the house salad and the chili). Did I mention that bread? We always ask for a basket refill and then take it home. haha.  My family's go-to restaurant for a good steak dinner. I could do without the hokey Western thing, though. Yeah, not much for theme dining."}
{"text":"Food is always wonderful and so is the service...but note to self...do not ever take a booth around the bar! Customers who are waiting to be seated hang around your booth-breathing down your neck while you are trying to eat."}
{"text":"The rolls and sweet butter are a great way to start! There was a mixup in my order (my fault entirely) but the server and manager changed it all up and all with a smile. The service was terrific. Chili was delicious and chunky. Roast chicken was flavorful. DW didn't love her steak though complaining it was over-salted.  My original meal (part of the mixup) consisted of BBQ sauce slathered chicken breasts that were unspectacular and ribs that were too dry and tasteless. We've had the ribs at other locations and they were quite good so this was something they could improve upon here."}
{"text":"Now I know this is not the \"best\" steak in the land, but it never fails.  A nice steak cooked to medium rare..yup, I like mine bloody, a fluffy baked potato with just a touch of butter and sour cream, and some of the yummiest caesar salad I can think off.  Very friendly service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The staff did a good job, all were timely, friendly, hand very helpful.  We found the food to be more than satisfactory in price and taste.."}
{"text":"This was the choice for  my birthday dinner and boy I picked a good one!!! We came in almost peak dinner time at 6:00. I figured since it was Wed. night we didn't need reservations and the parking lot was full. I am in and put my name on the list thinking I would have a long wait but to my surprise we were seated in 10 min.,it must be my birthday luck. The host already had fresh rolls & cinnamon butter set out for us which were delicious. The waitress came quickly after took out drink order and appetizer .  I did  order a giant strawberry banana margarita it taste like a virgin margarita I have to admit. I also ordered the fried pickles . I never had fried pickles before . They were delish and the cheapest on the app menu only $3.99 what a bargain and well worth ordering again. The steaks are A #1.  I ordered the 12 oz. hand cut rib eyewith two sides. All done to perfection,very memorable and by far the best steak I've ever had. My mother in law ordered the prime rib and she commented that it was the best prime rib she's ever had too. Both cuts were tender ,flavor full and seemed like prime beef. We were talking about my birthday and my husband & mother in law were  threatening to tell the waitress about my birthday but I know they didn't mention it to anybody . The next thing I know the waitress came out with a little sundae ,had me sit on a saddle with the patrons saying a big her had for my birthday.  The waitress was attentive & I'm sure over heard our conversation about my birthday. The over all experience was memorable. The prices were sooo reasonable and I highly recommend it to everybody. I will definitely come back again. I will also measure all my future steak orders to the best steak I ever had."}
{"text":"This is one of the best chain restaraunts you can go to here.  My kids absolutely love this place for the atmosphere, peanuts, and those warm rolls with cinna-butter they bring to your table as your seated.  Staff here is always pleasant, and attentive.  The ribs here are pretty good and it is usually all I order when we go, went last night and decided to try something different.  I went with the sirloin tips served over sauteed mushrooms and onions. WOW!!!!  Absolutely delicious, much better than the ribs!!!  And for what you get, the pricing is right.  Portions are big and very satisfying.  We just enjoy this place, great for families!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed  in my experience here. I love Texas Roadhouse and go quite frequently. I have never been to this location though. Myself and two friends, and a child came here last night to eat. We were sat around 6:35 or so, after waiting just a little while. First: when we were walked to the table, the hostess did not get any rolls for us. Which I found weird because every other table was sat with their rolls, and I know this is custom. Our waitress came right away, took our drink orders, and said she would be back with rolls. Didn't happen. We asked 2 times for rolls, they finally came about 5 minutes before our food came out. Second: we ordered a blooming onion, when we ordered we asked for the sauce it comes with and Ranch. We didn't get ranch, and I asked the food runner for ranch. She never came back. then I asked our waitress, and we finally got some, but by that time we'd eaten most of the onion without it. Our food was good, never anything to complain about there. But I was disappointed in those two points in the service. Very weird to get service like that at this chain, I know they are normally on top of everything. Not sure I would visit this location again."}
{"text":"Went there last night.  We did not have much of a wait to get in.  The onion blossom was really salty very spicy and took at least 15 minutes to get which was just a preview of things to come.  We order our dinners and it took 30 minutes to get.  The two steaks where over cooked and the prime rib was not as ordered the chicken was the only thing done right.  The manager came over to remade the steaks and left the sides rather then taking everything back and reserving the whole plate omg. He said 5 minutes for the remake well almost 20 minutes as we where ready to leave here come two steaks.   They where cook right but you this time who was hungry anymore.   Too top it off The waitress needed loots more training and thought it was not unusual said the kitchen help was not good We will not be back.  Poor food to much noise and management that does not care"}
{"text":"We have been to this location several times and I think last nights visit will be our last. We ordered the dinner for two combo which is an app and your choice of 2 dinners. Unfortunately our waitress (I don't remember her name because we only saw her 3 times, we actually thought she left for the evening at one point) put the entire order in at once. Therefore we got our app then 2 minutes later our salads and about 3 minutes after that our meals. When my wife spoke to the manager her response as well as the waitresses was \"well that happens sometimes\". Of course it does when you either don't know what your doing or you have more interest in turning a table over than providing a good guest experience. I wish I could say this was an isolated incident but as I said we have tried this place several times and last night was it.   The servers don't care about service or their customer and the management at this location cares even less.   I gave it 2 stars because the food was still pretty good despite all arriving at one time. Lesson learned, next time I will have to force the server to come back for the food order and don't expect common sense."}
{"text":"We visited the Washington, PA location whenever we were down that way. My wife and I were thrilled when they opened in Bridgeville. Unfortunately our first visits there were a major disappointment.  We complained to management and were persuaded to give them another try after a new management team took over. We were glad we did. The food now is actually better than the Washington, PA location. Our server Jamie was excellent as well. Our ribs and steaks were better than at any of the other chain restaurants we've tried. We thought the food was actually better than our local specialty restaurants as well. Texas Roadhouse is an excellent value for the money. Even the rolls were perfect.   The only thing we didn't see was the staff dancing. In Washington, PA the staff would do a line dance to entertain the customers. I can't say I really missed it. I always wondered who's food was getting cold while they danced.   Even though the Bridgeville location was busy the noise level was low. We could actually hold a conversation without speaking up. I'll trade the lower volume for a line dance any day.   If you're looking for an excellent steak at a good price I'd recommend giving them a try. If you were there more than 7 months ago and were less than happy you need to give them another shot.  We think you'll be glad you did.  Update 4/14: We revisited about a week ago. The service was still good and the staff was dancing. Unfortunately problems in the kitchen have re-surfaced. My steak was over cooked and my wife's cooked veggies were nearly raw. It took them three tries to get her veggies right. We complained and they did try to make amends. We hope that we just caught them on a bad night. In the meantime there's still the Washington, PA location.  Further update 12/16:  Their steaks are always over cooked, so we order ours medium rare to get the steaks to be delivered medium. Their rolls are usually slightly burnt and are not consistent in size. Still the place is a good value for the money. A six ounce steak dinner will set you back $9.99. On Tuesdays margaritas are only $2.  Further update 8/17 We've adjusted and simply order our steaks medium rare when we want medium. Great value for the money. I've upped my rating to a 4. Their birthday salutes are highly embarrassing,  but great fun."}
{"text":"Just went back for the first time in a year... the previous manager has finally been replaced. .. We now have the quality that we used to get... This time the food was as outstanding as the service has always been.... This is now a no brainer for a fantastic meal at an exceptional  value. My family is thrilled that we get our \"go to\" spot back.... thanks again for fixing the glaringly  obvious issue ( the previous  manager)... we will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times in the past. This last time, my son chose to go here for his 13th birthday dinner.  The night started fine, we walked in and were seated right away, the server brought drinks and bread. I mention to him that it was my sons 13th birthday and he nodded and said okay. As we where finishing our meal, he brought our check and no offer of dessert or singing to my son. I was greatly disappointed in this,as another party there was also celebrating a birthday and they were being sung to very loudly by the staff. My son, a little shy anyway, didn't seem to mind, but I certainly did! I paid for I meal and we left. We celebrated instead at home."}
{"text":"Our waitress was amazing! Can't remember her name but she's a pretty blonde. She made sure we always had plenty of sweet tea & fresh rolls! Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"So today I ate dinner with my family and paid over $200 for the meal I went to the bathroom and came back to the table when I noticed my family had left to the front and my Steelers hat that I had just purchased the day before was not with them or at the table when I asked the Busser he said that he had sent it to the hostess station when I approached the station I was informed the had given it to my family I Then ask them as they were still in the parking lot if they had been given my head nobody in my family had received my hat sell Texas roadhouse either gave my stuff away to somebody or somebody that works for them Vera decided that they needed my stuff more than me I will not attend a place where I can't go to the bathroom with worry that my stuff will get stolen from the table or that just randomly gives people stuff away"}
{"text":"Had my 21st here a few days ago. The was what you'd expect from a steak house. And the drink were okay! But some of my friends weren't able to order drinks here because the staff wasn't clear on the law for ID's and didn't pay much attention to details! I don't think I will volunteer this place to people but if they asked me to I would go back. Also not sure how much the staff likes their job. They didn't all seem happy and at times like cared. They do have their good moments like you'd expect but it's when things don't run according to plan they get weird"}
{"text":"I usually never have a problem when I come here but we called ahead and still had to wait a very long time and almost left. There was a miscommunication and we asked to speak to the general manager. He was very professional and easy to talk to. He made it right and our server Caleb was awesome! Definitely going to keep coming here."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the first time and my experience was great!  They offered me their delicious soft rolls and they also allowed me to use my coupon. Food was still warm when I got home !!!"}
{"text":"Yummy, Yummy Rolls! Yep, that along with one of my best girlfriend's birthdays convinced me to drive all the away across town. (I would have done it for her regardless but still, the rolls were a plus) I wasn't really hungry but I did order the veggie plate in which I got a salad, two sweet potatoes (one loaded) and some sauteed mushrooms for about $8.00. I thank my lovely waitresses who's name escapes me right now :( for letting me know it would be cheaper to order it that way instead of how I was a going to order. I ended up only eating the salad and taking everything else, along with about 4 rolls home with me. ( Greedy much? yep)  It was a great evening, the staff were great, including convincing my friend to get up on the saddle to have the entire restaurant wish her a happy birthday (so embarrassing) but she had a blast and that was all that matters :)"}
{"text":"There is a guy that I am dating that really likes this place. So much so that we come at least once a week and the waitstaff are starting to take notice. He orders the same thing every single week, and me, I like to go rogue and change it up. At the rate we are going, I will have tried everything on the menu soon. So far my favorite is the BBQ chicken that only the fabulous waitress Melissa knows how to order for me. Every time I try to order via another server, it always comes out WRONG, WRONG, WRONG! Their croutons (yes croutons) are delicious as they are made fresh daily every single day. I am a little obsessed with to the point that I only want my side dish to be one HUGE salad with a ton of croutons. Oh and don't forget about there fresh baked rolls. There have a been a few times in which they tasted stale. Not sure how that is even possible but it has happened. I will say that as long as I am dating this guy, this place will be on a constant rotation. SMH! until next time...."}
{"text":"First and foremost, be prepared to wait. This is a VERY popular location and even at mid-afternoon times it's busy.   With that said, I had never heard of Texas Roadhouse before a few months ago, but even so, I've been about 4 times since my initial visit. The portion sizes are huge, flavorful, and very reasonably priced. I'll go here for dinner and have enough leftovers for lunch the next day. Plus the yeast rolls with cinnamon butter are fantastic!   The only downfall of this location is service. I've had some fantastic waiters and waitresses, great attitude and excellent suggestions, but this location seems understaffed. Tables often stay dirty for a while and even though my waiter/waitress is running around constantly, my drink goes empty or I need something with my food order and no one is around to assist. This is a busy location and I don't expect someone to hover over me, however, 20 minutes between check-ins is a bit much.   This food and atmosphere will continue to bring me back here. And while I've never had absolutely poor service here, it's a bit frustrating to need something during a meal and not being able to ask for assistance for quite some time. The wait staff always ends up apologizing for not being around; saying they are swamped with tables. This is preventable from the correct actions from management."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times & don't remember ever having a problem.  Keep in mind they are NOT a lunch place during the week since they don't open until 3pm.  My favorite is the sweet tea & the free rolls with cinnamon butter. My husband's favorite is the steak kabobs & ribs appetizer. They have baked sweet potatoe with marshmallows which is hard to find. I find that the pulled pork sandwich is a bit salty than I'd like. The atmosphere is always loud & they have country music on the Muzak which is good or bad depending on your taste."}
{"text":"Katie was awesome!!! Best service ever! She was great and really took care of us. We were super needy and kinda a pain in the butt. The food was awesome! Bread is amazing and our food all came out great, fresh and hot"}
{"text":"I always love Texas Roadhouse. I usually get the ribeye steak which is fabulous. For lunch, I opted for a chicken sandwich which was also terrific. The salad and their homemade croutons are the best. And those rolls... those rolls though. Awesome place to eat!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about?  Had a gift certificate to use, waited for 45 minutes amongst the peanut scrapes.  Finally get to our table about 5:30 to find out they are already out of prime rib.  Huh?!   The cuts of meat are not great quality.  Not sure why I'm taking the time to write this, this place is always busy anyway!"}
{"text":"The staff is nice, but the food not so much.  I asked for a rare steak and got a medium.  I sent it back and the steak they replaced it with was between medium-rare and medium.  The first steak actually looked nice and seared, the second steak had no sear at all.  It looked like something I'd get at Denny's for 10 bucks.  Severely unimpressive for a $26 steak."}
{"text":"Stopped by the ole Roadhouse on Saturday to meet the family for lunch. They like it. I'm slowly trying to convince them there are so many places that are worth a try... Work in progress. Anyway... the only reason I've decided to write a review is because our server was excellent. Truly excellent.  I can't for the life of me remember her name but will go out of my way to call or stop by next week because she was that impressive and deserves recognition.   Service = 1star - the server deserves 10 stars but I refuse to contribute to the overall rating with that.  Rolls = 1 star - fresh and fantastic!  Sirloin steak. Sad and pathetic tiny piece of meat. AKA McSteak. Actually, that would probably be a better value.  Grilled chicken. Dry. Killed repeatedly and if that wasn't enough, drowned in sauce in a sad attempt to make it better. Did not work.  Catfish. Mother in Law loves it. I've never tried it so I remain neutral.  So yeah, it's a chain. Below average, inedible, chain food. I might actually prefer the Olive Garden. At least they have awesome salad and breadsticks."}
{"text":"I love this place. I keep coming back. Steaks are fabulous and their ribs truly do fall off the bone. They are really good. I especially love their rolls.."}
{"text":"I have been disappointed the last few times we have been here. The very last time was an absolutely awful experience. My husband and I have had very bad service 2 times in a row but my mom wanted to go out for her birthday and since some of my family can only eat certain foods she choice Texas Roadhouse. We called ahead for call ahead seating. Once we arrived the table was not ready and we had to actually wait 20 more minutes. When we were seated the waitress took our drink orders and returned quickly, We then place our orders and had to wait close to 40 minutes for our food. When the food arrived my steak was burnt and my dad's was close to it. We both had ordered med well. I sent my food back and told him just to take it off of our bill because I was not waiting another 40 minutes for a steak. My dad ate his piece of leather but was not happy about it. The waitress did not try to go out of her way to make us happy she actually acted as though she got mad when we told her about our food. We had to ask for items such as butter and refills on drinks several times and had to ask for to-go boxes for times. My husband actually had to get up go to the front of the restaurant and ask where our waitress was so we could get our check. We had to sit 20 extra minutes waiting on our check. I had to get fast food on the way home because all I had to est was bread. I called the restaurant the next day to speak to a manager and was told a manager was not in but they would take down my information and have someone call me. I still have not received the phone call and it's been a week. This was the final straw and I will never return."}
{"text":"Just ordered carryout but the staff was still friendly and professional, and the MR porterhouse I got was cooked perfect and everything else was fabulous. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very friendly service, and I always like places that allows you to throw peanuts all over the place.  I had the steak with veggies, and it was good, nothing special, but decent.  If I have to pick between this and Outback, I'll probably do Outback first."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have enjoyed myself each time. I am reminded of Texas with the country music, laid back decor and of course, the food! You walk in and see steaks in the chiller...mmmm beef!! You are immediately greeted with amazing rolls ad cinnamon butter as you sit down...both are amazing! Service is attentive and prices are really reasonable. If you don't eat meat or are on a diet, I really wouldn't suggest going here because eveerything is meat and butter here. I've ordered the BBQ chicken and filet medalions, both are cooked perfectly and taste good. I haven't ordered their speciality cocktails but they look amazing!! Good beer prices though...overall a thumbs up for me and will keep returning!  TIP: If you go on a weekend night, expect a wait. Last time I went on a Saturday, the wait was over an hour. But, if you go on a week night, there isn't a wait at all!"}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is a good young family spot. Having a 15 month old here throwing stuff on the floor although not what we want him to do does not seem to be an issue as there are shells all over the floor. The food is good we mainly get the prime rib and it has always been medium rare the way it's ordered. The drinks at also Good I would like to see the margaritas made with fresh juice, however, the pack a punch so be careful. Service is usually on point. We will continue to come here as it is a quick, easy, fairly evening out."}
{"text":"I'm being totally ignored at the bar right now. Although I got my drink in a \"reasonable\" time. I've got no service since. People to left and right who sat down after me already have there appetizers. The bartenders Mya, Hannah and another female bartender. Aren't that busy. I've been done with my margarita for 15min but no conversation or anything. This will be the last time I come here. There are other places to get my prime rib fix."}
{"text":"Overall we had good service.  You get charged more than the prices on the kid's menus for the actual kid's meal.  The portions are large but the crispy chicken tenders lack any actual flavor.  We also ordered the chili cheese fries; the chili tastes like canned chili and the cheese was not melted on the fries when they come out.  We had to ask for silverware and plates even after our appetizer was brought out.  Our waiter was really nice and did keep our drinks full though."}
{"text":"The house was beautiful but sometimes loud. The food was delicious and the service was good. Come here with my friends next time."}
{"text":"Visited this TR three times now and been pretty satisfied, food was good, service was good, atmosphere was horrible. When a certain song is played all the waitresses stop, clap there hands as loud as they can, scream something that doesn't sound like english and wave their butts right near your food on the table. I enjoy having a casual conversation with my wife when we go out to eat, yes even after 40yrs of marriage we enjoy talking to each other. TR can't quite decide if they want to be a restaurant or a beer swilling bar. Maybe they need to separate the bar section from the restaurant, would make me happy."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and it is always consistent. Yes, it is a chain but the atmosphere gives you a feeling of uniqueness-almost like you are out of town.  Servers wear shirts that say, \"I love my job\" and it is easy to believe with the friendliness and aim to please attitude.  I must say, I don't get that vibe from the hostesses though. Food is always excellent!!  Oddly enough I always get the veggie plate at a steak joint!  But always fresh and delicious. My Husband & Father love the ribs-they smell intoxicating.  Mozzarella sticks are by far my favorite over any other restaurant.  Peanuts on every table are always a plus.  Family favorite!!"}
{"text":"Yeehaw! Good cow and drinks! Always enjoy coming to a Texas Roadhouse. Staff are usually fun, upbeat and energetic. Service this time was a little dull. Took the waitress a few times to get drinks and orders correct. Otherwise nice timing for food and saw waitress a decent amount through out meal."}
{"text":"They have the best rolls in the world.. chicken critters are amazing along with the staff"}
{"text":"my experience here was just OK.  Our server was VERY pushy it his attempts to upsell, almost to the point that I was getting frustrated.  You shouldn't have to come up with creative ways to say \"no thank you\" but anyway... Other than that, the food was decent, and for as busy as the place way, it was relatively decent service.  Could have been better, but definitely cool have been worse."}
{"text":"This is horrible. I asked for a booth and was seated in the middle of the hall. I have been here for 15 minutes and have not seen the waitress.... I was told we could Not be seated on a booth because there isn't a waitress there... Where in a hell is the waitress to whee we seated! Love roadhouse, I guess this is just a bad location."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and great service! I would recommend to anyone looking for a great steak dinner."}
{"text":"OK, so apparently we returned a couple more times, even after our past mediocre visits. The key to being happy with this restaurant is to order their ribs. I really enjoy their ribs and feel so-so about their other entrees. I will keep returning for their ribs! The staff is also nice."}
{"text":"Food, service, ambiance - Id give this place 10 stars if I could!!!!!! BBQ was amazing! I had the prime rib- to die for!!!!! Mom had the BBQ platter with ribs and chicken, OMG!!!!!1 The ribs fell off the bone.... But the flavor! This was the best meal of my short weekend stay in Arizona! Highly recommend ! Every table as packed with people!"}
{"text":"Food was horrible...and service was even worse. All food was over salted and tasted horrible. It didn't seem fresh at all.  Had to wait multiple times for drink refills. Had to wait 10 minutes for waiter to pick up our bill. \"Budd\"...u might want to find a different line of work!"}
{"text":"They have free peanuts. Loud place not the best for conversation. It seems that it is everyones birthday that goes there, as they have to sing the song every 13 seconds. My baby hates this place, dad loves it. Meals are good sized good for splits. Steak is ok nothing to shake a stick at. I still prefer outback."}
{"text":"Great steaks but today they are carding everyone so if you want alcoholic beverage bring your id"}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in last night and thought there would be a long wait but we got seated right away, had excellent service, great food and drinks - We will be back! Thanks Texas Roadhouse for making our night special."}
{"text":"Jestin was an incredible server, the food and drinks came out fast and super fresh and tasty! We got wings as an appetizer and wife my got the steak and I got BBQ chicken. Excellent staff and ambiance. Too full for dessert because of the yummy rolls and peanuts at each table"}
{"text":"First time here.always sit at bar. Faster service for food and drinks. And TV are usually around the bar. First off bartender was very helpful on what's good, etc. also on drinks his suggestion was perfect. Margarita. Not too strong and not too much lime juice.  To start the rolls are amazing. The butter by the way is butter, honey and cinnamon blended. Easy to make at home. Then I got the combo BBQ chicken and steak. Chicken perfect, not dry. Steak small but again perfectly cooked and spiced. The BBQ sauce on the chicken is not thick and overly sweet. Very nice  The bartender Haley is a totally hot motorcycle riding in shape babe. She is super nice and you can tell she just loves he job and life in general  Just a few notes:  place is slammed busy and it is noisy. If you want a nice quiet dinner don't go here this is a party kinda place. All the staff was nice and helpful. Kudos to the manager. Keep it up. We have become regulars."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and service. Was promptly greeted upon arrival and was seated and drink ordered. The 11 dinners for $8.99 before 6pm I thought was a fantastic value and upon receiving my food I was right. Plenty of help and service the day I was there, and arrived about 5:45 a little early but I'm on east coast time so it was just right"}
{"text":"We have eaten at this location twice and both times our steaks have been cooked completely wrong. The first time we ordered medium and medium well and got all very well done. The cooked a new steak for me that time but my husband was done eating by the time my food came back. This time my husband asked for medium well and got rare. So we sent it back. They brought it back very quickly and it was still very red. By now it had been cut into several pieces. So the manager took it back again and brought back for little charred pieces of meat. We just gave up after that. Not going back. Rather drive to arrowhead and wait longer or just go to outback."}
{"text":"Quality: I had the Chicken Tender meal with the corn dish and the steak fries. The quality is delicious and it doesn't taste like it came from a frozen bag. Everything is really fresh, especially the complimentary rolls and sweet butter they offer. It makes me come back again and again.  Service: The service here has always been exceptional. The servers seem genuinely interested in assisting you and go above and beyond to make sure you are consistency refilled with drinks and rolls  Speed: If you get here early enough, you won't have a wait. On the other hand, going at 7 p.m. on a Friday night can be up to two hours. Make sure to plan ahead if you want to eat here. It takes about 15 minutes to receive your food from when you order, but you'll receive unlimited rolls and cinnamon butter in the meantime. As a tip, utilize their \"Call-ahead\" seating. While they don't accept reservations, you'll receive a table faster if you call anytime before you arrive. I often call as soon as I get in the car!  Price: The prices are very modest. I tend to leave with a $16 bill including tip and always leave more than full. If you come before 6 p.m. on most weekdays, you can receive an \"Early bird\" meal discount on many food items.  Atmosphere: The restaurant is covered in country and \"America\" decor, and they play music to fit. It feels like a very casual and great place if you aren't looking for something fancy. It's very loud and has a \"roudy\" feel to it, so if you aren't looking for this type of atmosphere, this won't be the place. For those looking for a fun, laid back time, you'll fit in just fine.  Location: The parking lot can often be very full, so get here early. The location itself is located not terribly far from campus or the main part of Champaign. It's not difficult to get to if you have a car, but a bus can be more difficult to time correctly.  Variety: While they don't offer many healthy options to my girlfriend's dismay, they have your typical american fare. Not a place to take someone on a diet or who is a vegetarian, but you'll find your favorite meat item here (Chicken, steak, shrimp, etc.)  Consistency: I have constantly received excellent service, and while the food is better some days than others, I constantly want to go back.  Final thoughts; I love Texas Roadhouse. It's been one of my favorite places to go and has consistently delivered on both quality and service. Make sure to come early to avoid the long waits, but it's definitely worth any wait!"}
{"text":"We went to the Roadhouse to try a different Steakhouse. We were first seated at a booth that had no waiter we finally got a waiter he gave us complimentary appetizers to make up for the 20-minute wait. We ordered the top sirloin steaks. One 11oz well done the other a 16oz medium well. The bread rolls were good the salads we're fine the baked potatoes we're hot and large. But our steaks were very overcooked and dry which disappointed us. The servers and service was great, the place is clean, the appetizers were okay but we are disappointed in our steaks."}
{"text":"I score this not because of the food but because of the service . We sat down and took for ever for the waitress to come to our table.  We had to ask for the complementary roles while the other waitress friends were sitting next to us received 9 baskets of roles  and we waited . Then my Meal comes with no sides not kidding there not done yet . Meal was warm at most . I guess this locations caters to their friends . By far the worst Texas road house I've been at ...."}
{"text":"Always a good time.  Keeps the kids entertained when they dance in the mail aisle - usually ends up being one time at each of our visits.  Peanuts are always something else to keep the kids occupied as they wait.  Peel away!    Use the all ahead seating - it works amazingly.  Though you might have a small wait it does not compare to the up to 2 hour wait that can often times occur.  We always have prime rib on the weekends and I also like the filet.    Something about their house salad with the tangy french is delish."}
{"text":"In general, I like Texas Roadhouse. They have a great variety of food that my husband and I like to eat. We made the mistake, however, of meeting friends at this Texas Roadhouse. It was way, way too loud such that we couldn't hear each other.  I'll definitely come back, but when I'm dining with someone I don't care to talk to or listen to. The loud birthdays are a bit much. What are we little kids? It doesn't need to be that loud. Otherwise, the food is good."}
{"text":"My 1st experience at a Texas Roadhouse and I was not impressed.  We did the call ahead to get seated faster and we still had to wait for 25 minutes before we got sat to a table.  Once our order was put in we had to wait 30 minutes for our food to come. Server was nice enough to bring us another round of bread while we waited.  I ordered my steak med rare and it came out medium at best, it was a thick lumpy piece of meat so some of my meat was actually well done.  It was extremely chewy. I also ordered a half rack of ribs which was dry.  My side Caesar salad was so so.  The best part about my meal was the dinner rolls which were hot fresh and tasty.  Overall it was not worth the money or the wait in my opinion."}
{"text":"My husband LOVE this place for the cheap eats and free peanuts. I acquiesced and agreed to go with him for a belated birthday meal. This location just opened recently and was packed on a Friday night at 5pm. They have deals on drinks for happy hour. Monday - Thursday there are early bird specials that my husband particularly appreciates. But, alas, we went on a Friday night. The salad was actually better than I have had at other locations. Free rolls and peanuts. Hubby had a sirloin, mushrooms,  and a side of ribs. He liked his steak but I thought the ribs had too much sauce. I had The Roadkill chopped steak. It comes with onions, mushrooms, and cheese. The meat was pretty tasty, but it came with a side of grease and salt. The baked potato was dry, a bit disappointing. It is also VERY loud, so be prepared. I would have given this place a 3 star , but my husband loves this place. Did I mention he loves this place? Service is always prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Arrogant and incompetent, period. Have been here a few times for after work happy hour, drinks and apps were typical. However, we started ordering to go orders that at first were fine, then they must of had a management change or they just don't care. The first few problems were incorrect orders. I know it is not a huge thing, however if you ordered your salad with ranch and they give you a dressing you don't like, your out your salad. The the problem was our order was 30 mins late after we phoned in ahead.  I called the manager after 20 mins and she was so nonchalant about the situation and could basically care less and blamed it on new training. So today, I called and was on hold for 9 mins, called back and on hold for 6 mins, called back and asked for a manager and lucky me I got to speak with the \"nonchalant\" manager. She was nice and borderline bubbly and explained away my hold time for more training issues. I told her briefly of our past experiences and she could again care less and asked what we wanted to order. We ordered 2 steaks, one med well and one med rare. One with white gravy for the potatoes and one with brown. We pick up the order and it was ready, cool beans now I don't have to listen to my roommate complain about the wait. HOLD ON, put on the breaks. They gave us two med rare steaks when I wanted one med well and both had brown gravy.   How does this happen? How can a manager take an order from a customer who has had problems in the past and not check it? Well, I tried calling but was on hold for 7 mins and for my sanity decided tio just call corporate tomorrow. Oh they did give us 2 extra rolls though. I took a pic of the raw meat that is still in my fridge.   There are literally 2-3 other steak places next door, do yourself a favor and skip Texas Road House, clearly from their phone takers to management they are all incompetent."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on impulse en route to Hobby Lobby and upon seeing it was 5:30 I realized I was in time for the early bird specials for $8.99.  I ordered the six-oz Sirloin with two sides.  This time I was aware in advance that when they ask you if you want toppings it costs extra even though they don't tell you about it.  The green beans were probably saltier than is healthy and cooked in the \"mushy\" style, which I like fine, and had lots of good bacon pieces and flavor.  The Caesar salad couldn't have been much better, cold, crisp and crunchy with just the right amount of good dressing. The rolls are delicious but awfully sweet to blend with the meal, more like a dessert unto themselves, especially with the cinnamon butter.    I was impressed with the steak which was so thick it was almost an ovoid.  It was cooked more rare than medium rare but I like that fine, too.  The impressive part was how nicely the knife cut through it and how easy it was to chew.  I've gotten steaks twice in the last few months from Outback for a couple dollars more that were so tough you couldn't stab it with a fork, had to be a lumberjack to saw through it and it chewed like your grandmother's old shoe leather.   It was a real treat to eat this one and have it be the way a good steak should be.    I would come back easily, and hope I will sometime.  My only objection is that they constantly try to upsell you to drinks, appetizers, toppings, etc.  The waiter was very nice and efficient, I just don't want the times I have to say No, thank you to outnumber the times I say Yes, please.  It sets a tone of negativity in its own way."}
{"text":"Dec. 2010: I ended up here by accident, having gone to Golden Corral to try out their dinner only to be told at the door that they were closed for an employee party.  I spent about 15 minutes in their parking lot (phone server was running slow) poring over my options in the area and decided to give this place a try.  It was about 8pm.  It wasn't crowded at all so I was seated right away. The waitress kind of surprised me when she plopped down across from me and started talking to me like I was somebody she knew, but I kind of got a kick out of it.  I had looked at the menu and the hostess told me on the way in that her favorite was the sirloin so I decided to get it. It was under $11, which I thought was reasonable. It came with two sides so I got green beans and seasoned rice.  Rolls are provided right away and there is a bucket of peanuts on the table to hold you while you wait.  The rolls were excellent, soft and yeasty, with a cinnamon butter that was delicious but sweet and better suited for dessert.  The green beans were kind of salty but cooked in bacon and had good flavor, the rice was unimpressive, sort of reminded me if a rice-a-roni, but that steak was perfect!  It was so tender I barely needed a knife to cut it and had a nice grilled flavor.    I found out they had an early bird special menu and returned 10 days later to try it.  I got a  Chicken Fried Steak smothered in gravy with sides of Caesar Salad and mashed potatoes.  For a dollar extra I got them \"loaded,\" topped with grated cheese, butter, onions, sour cream and a side of brown gravy--more toppings than potatoes!  All were good although the steak was very salty.    I wanted to get back there again before I left town but didn't make it since I returned to San Diego a week later.  Nov. 2012:  I'm back in town and finally got back here, barely squeaked in by the 6pm deadline for the early bird steak dinner.  I ordered fast and my waitress submitted it a minute to six!  This time it was a 6-oz sirloin with sides of green beans (very bacon-y but not so salty this time), and mashed potatoes.  Because of the rush when she asked if I wanted the potatoes loaded I just said yes and forgot to ask if it was extra.  It was.  I think they should let you know this.  I probably still would've gotten it for a dollar but I think it's fair to tell people.  When she asked if I wanted the steak \"smothered\" I did think to ask if that was extra, and she said yes it was 99cents.  It turned out it was $1.99.  So my $8.50 steak dinner ended up an $11.50 dinner, not so much of a bargain.  Next time I'll know. But she should have told me the truth.  Other than that she was a great waitress, checked back frequently to make sure everything was ok, etc.  I would return because the steak is so good.  And I should mention that it was extremely busy on a Wednesday night at 6pm, so there must be a lot of people happy with the place."}
{"text":"every time I go, I get really good food, the wait is minimal if any, the service is nice if a little slow at times, but there's really nothing I could complain about. I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time I've gone, my waiter/waitress is always in a good mood, helpful, & patient! The staff makes me feel welcomed & the food is fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great people and awesome service. Every time me and the wifey come here there is no disappointments."}
{"text":"Amber was our waitress this evening and she was fantastic the food was absolutely delicious and the service was outstanding had a great time have a great meal with my family I highly suggest going to Texas roadhouse in Gilbert after Jermaine and Gilbert Road it's a fantastic place to dine"}
{"text":"Okay, everytime I go to a steak house, for some reason they seem to think that medium means rare. I absolutely cannot stand the sight of rare meat so when I get my steak back almost walking, I tend to get upset. But the manager here was very very nice and professional about everything. He made sure that everything was perfect when he came to our table. And then he only charged me for one meal. So I couldn't be upset with the service, but the cook needs a little refresher on how a steak is cooked correctly for the customers wants. That's all. The waitresses have such great manners and a lot of hospitality. I love that."}
{"text":"Well, wasn't sure what to expect, had not been to one of these before! Steak was excellent, prepared perfectly (I am a Medium Rare guy). Yeast rolls were OMG delicious, side of a baked potato, done perfectly, nice soft and hot, this meal was a real treat.  Pros: 1. Great steak 2. Reasonably priced 3. Great service 4. Great sides 5. Peanuts on the table in the shell, love that!  Cons: Nothing  Summary Easy parking, easy access, right off interstate, great food, great service. I will be back when in the area, I come up to visit family so not here that often but this place just made my list of must visit while I am up there!"}
{"text":"My husband, son and I go to Texas Roadhouse on occasion as it's usually good and affordable. Today, we drive home from Philadelphia and only stopped once for gas and the restrooms.  We decided to go to TR because we hadn't eaten all day...but we would have been better off not doing that. My husband and son wouldn't finish their burgers,  they said the rolls were stale and the beef was mushy. My 17 year old son was given 6 french fries so we asked for a side order, which they charged us for (the fries were good). I ordered the salad with chicken but it was so overwhelmed with cheese that I could only eat about a third because you couldn't taste the egg, tomato, lettuce etc. I told our waitress and her reply was a giggle and a \"yeah, I thought they put too much cheese on it too.\"  And there you have it...$37 bucks and we all left with food on our plates. Thankfully we had hotdogs in the house because that's what's for dinner."}
{"text":"Didn't even have to eat here to have a bad experience. I wanted to go here for my Bday dinner but unfortunately they make it impossible. First off, you can't make a reservation so good luck trying to have a party larger than 5 seated in a reasonable time. Sure you can \"call-ahead\" an hour before and they will try to get something put together for you by the time you plan to show up, but no promises. And you better have your whole party there on time or else you SOL because they apparently aren't there to cater to you. And to top it off, I hope you didn't want to sit with everyone you invited... because that's not going to happen. But they will do their best to get you all sitting in the same general area in booths that are side to side or back to back. Makes for real great conversation when you can't even sit next to the people koi invited. And I hope your ok with picking and choosing which family members and friends are good enough to sit at your table. Anyways, I made the easy decision of changing my party location to Logans across the street and they took my reservation without issue and will be seating us all together."}
{"text":"Moths. Long wait for food. Stuffed in corner. 2011 mike on tap.  Mike was a great server. Carrots undercooked. Steak overcooked."}
{"text":"Went there with my family for my little brothers birthday. It was very very busy. Still managed to get us in 30 min but other than that experience was good. Food was good. Service was good."}
{"text":"Went in today for dinner. Our server was Christina and she was outstanding! Extremely friendly, helped us with some questions we had, and very prompt service. My fiancé's steak was a little under done but she stayed right there till we cut into the steak and took it right back so it came back a few minutes later hot and cooked perfect. We understand it happens but her great service of waiting to make sure instead of us having to flag someone down made it quick and not a problem at all.   We love the Fort Worth ribeye. So tender, juicy, and a ton of flavor. My fiancé gets his smothered with everything and I steel his caramelized onions. We also love the side salad with Italian dressing. I think they make the Italian home made because it's nothing like I have ever tasted before. It's strong flavor and amazing. Don't even get me started with those rolls though... yum!   Highly recommend to go here. You can't beat their prices too. One of the lowest price quality steak places in the valley! Make sure to do call ahead seating as it gets busy. And if you want a great tasting steak, go for the rib eye!"}
{"text":"My family has been here many times and the food is delicious. The sirloin is tender with a great seasoning. The pork chops and ribs are tasty too. You have a full bar to plodder from as well."}
{"text":"I was really surprised by everything here on Saturday night! This was my first time here, the in-laws decided to take us out. To be honest I wasn't totally excited about coming here, thinking it is just another \"typical steakhouse\". I was wrong. Service at the hostess stand was the definition of chaos. We had called ahead, gotten a number, then when we got there realized they had given someone else our number as well. So the other table was sat, and we had to wait. 5-10 min we were told, after 15, we went back up to the stand to ask when we would be seated. We got a confused look, and they just said, \"Oh we will seat you right now!' Ok whatever, just get us seated and give me those rolls with cinnamon butter that I have heard so much about.  Service was incredible, our waitress was very sweet, and we never had to ask for anything. I ordered the ribs, with chili and french fries. Ribs = A OK. Fall off the bone for sure. Fries, were fries. The chili on the other hand was great!!! Menu says its \"house made Texas red chili\", tasted home made for sure.  Everyone else at the table was very happy with their steaks, all cooked as ordered. Overall great experience except for the little hiccup at the hostess stand. But that's what happens when you leave the entire front of the restaurant to be run by 16-17 years olds."}
{"text":"They have an $8.99 lunch menu and entire menu is available for lunch. The bread is warm and fresh and very sweet as is the butter. The salad had fresh hard boiled eggs and the Italian dressing was tasty but also very sweet. The ribs do fall off the bone and the sweet potato, which is actually a yam was very firm. If you like over cooked meat and everything loaded with sugar then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"My family and I have always enjoyed TR's in Gastonia. Great steaks & wonderful prices. My mother in law has a gluten allergy and they are always understanding and ready to please. Good atmosphere & service. Definitely one of my favorites when in the area!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best chain restaurants around. The service is always fast and friendly and the food never dissapoints. The bone in ribeye is amazing."}
{"text":"I LOVE Texas Roadhouse. The restaurant i give 5 stars. However i was very upset on how i was treated by the hostess. I called in to see if i was able to do a \"reservation\" for a large party this was around 8:15pm. The hostess asked when would i arrive and the name for the table, I had arrived by 8:30 and had my fiance go up to the front to let them know we were there. The hostess let my fiance know they were waiting on a table it would be about a 45 minute wait, he then asked what was the point of getting our info down and calling to reserve a table her response was \"we really don't take reservations we just bump you up to the front on the waiting list\" So we waited and three other parties were seated ahead of us. At this point i was very irritated and it was already 9:45 i decided to say forget it got the managers name and the hostess didn't mind that we were done waiting. A simple sorry about that would have been nice but all she said was oh, ok. I hope the next time i go in i am given an accurate time and a simple we do not take reservations will be GREAT!"}
{"text":"It had been a while that I've been here.  I had the grilled bbq chicken with green beans and cesars salad. The green beens were very good but the salad had way to much dressing. The Chicken was delicious. I could not finish it because we also ordered appetizers. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Been a couple of times last year . First time wasn't bad. But it got worse. We had a waiter that weve seen a few times,and once he sat with a fat bitch and skinny one that I assumed were employees,and they kept going back to get drinks. And took him forever to bring our check. These people are downright lazy asses. And another time, we barely saw our waiter. Hire better waiters and waitresses. Oh and managers don't care. They walk around and talk to other people."}
{"text":"Our meats came out med-well and blue, we ordered them both med-rare. The host didn't seat us with a bread basket, and while that's okay, they didn't drop one off later, and the nice guy that dropped off our salads brought us one after it was brought to his attention. (Kinda wish he was our server) Our server set down her book on the table to rifle through her numerous pages to find our table number every time she stopped by so she could write down what we ordered. Between this and the blaring speakers so the servers could perform a line dance/birthday song near the bar, I think we may fire up our own grill from now on."}
{"text":"Just had a great meal with my family,service was excellent particularly our server Deborah.Great job!"}
{"text":"Incorrect online info!! The website indicated this restaurant's hours were 11am-11pm daily, yet when we arrived at 9:30pm on Sunday, they were closed."}
{"text":"So we are kind of obsessed with this place and apparently so is the rest of Mesa.  There is always a line out the door.. I think the only time to come and not wait that long would be 4-5 on a early week night.  They welcome you with a basket of warm, soft rolls.  I've had the smaller steak and ribs.  My fiance really likes their blooming onion.  The caesar salad was also very good and I consider myself a connoisseur.  We've always had outstanding service here and think it is quite affordable for a steak house."}
{"text":"This place was just an outstanding value. 50$ for a Ribeye is starting g to piss me off.  Let's start with entering the building. Greated by someone as we walk in, they seat is at the bar and bring fresh warm bread as we were being seated. Server promptly greeted us and told us about the concept. We went with the 16oz ribeye. We selected a rather attractive steak from the case. 20$. Are you kidding me! We each ordered a salad and is was quite nice.   Streak came out a ver nice medium rare smothered with onions and shrooms. We split it and still took home a nice portion of it."}
{"text":"Catfish was GREAT 5 out of 5. My wife liked the steak 4 out of 5 steak fries was GREAT 5 out of 5 and the baked potato was good 4 out 5. Overall 4.5 out of 5 will go back"}
{"text":"Employees here are wonderful as always. They are trained very very well and are good at their jobs, I do however have a few issues with the restaurant itself.   I called ahead to get into the queue line, and it took them 15 minutes to even answer the phone, and it was not during a rush time.   Our waitress was very nice and get the rolls coming which my party appreciated.  But about halfway through our meal the music started BLASTING at a loud volume. Everyone around us was complaining about it, but they did nothing. You could barely hear the person across from you."}
{"text":"I have tried to visit this location numerous times and try to disregard the bad experiences I have had while dining at this establishment.  The only reason I've returned was because I do love the fried pickles, but at this point I feel the negative far outweighs the positive.  I am trans woman and because of that I feel every time I visit this establishment I've been made to feel quite uncomfortable by employees of this restaurant on multiple occasions.  It's to the point where it's not worth having to be treated like your less than because of the fact your trans.  It pains me to write this review because I was a server for a long time and spent a lot of time working at restaurants.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS ALL PEOPLE NEED TO BE TREATED FAIRLY AND EQUALLY REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY ARE."}
{"text":"I have been to this Texas Roadhouse before and the food has been acceptable.  In fact, on Veteran's Day we went in and I ordered the cheeseburger and asked that it be cooked \"rare\" and it was perfect and delicious.  I wanted to experience that great burger again so we went back tonight.  First, I requested no lettuce on the burger - it came with no lettuce, tomato or onion.  The waitress was absolutely wonderful - she took it right back and had the problem fixed.  The problem arose when I bit into the burger and it was cooked to the point that no taste was left.  I had eaten a portion of it when the waitress came back and I told her the problem.  She said she would get me another cooked properly but I was half done at that point.  I have a healthy appetite and almost never leave food on my plate.  Half of the overcooked burger was all I could stomach.  While the waitress was sweet and very apologetic I thought that a manager might have come to smooth over a disappointed customer, but that never happened.  Service is generally good but the food is inconsistent but fairly cheap, so just be aware that this the situation before you go there."}
{"text":"I wish there were more locations.  It's difficult to get into because you have to enter off hwy 51 and are unable to enter the shopping center from independence boulevard.  I think they have great prices for the quality of food.  You can pick out your own steak from a meat case upon arrival if you wish.  Those steaks are larger and more expensive.  Everyone at my table either had the 6 or 8 oz sirloin with different sides.  I really like their side salad because it comes with a boiled eggs on top.  Great home made ranch dressing. They have early bird specials that are great deals that I believe are served from 3pm-6pm Monday through Friday.  I will warn you, it is extremely loud and not a great place to have a conversation with your fellow diners.  They serve peanuts in a shell at the beginning of the meal.  They also have amazing yeast rolls served through out the meal that are bottomless.  There is a large bar area with plenty of TVs available for viewing.   I had a friend book a small private party and request a private room.  The restaurant said they could accommodate however, upon arrival the \"private\" dining  room was actually just a very small corner inside the main dining room.  There was nothing private about it at all. Beware of that if you ask for a private dining room. I will go back here again."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse seems to have it down when it comes to consistency.  We ate here tonight with another couple and had the usual sirloin steak, mushrooms, sweet potato, and delicious rolls.  The service was friendly and timely.   They do the birthday celebrations on the saddle and the big Texas \"Yee-haw\".  I find it better than the annoying songs some places half-heartedly sing. As a friend put it, \"This place offers a high quality steak at Denny's prices\" (Thanks, George)."}
{"text":"You can't find a better steak at a better price than TX Roadhouse!  I was so excited that a location opened up near my house.  The service is usually very good.    The menu has everything from steak to ribs to chicken to burgers.  I have to admit, I have only had the steak here.  Smother it in mushrooms, onions, oh ya.  TX Roadhouse has always cooked my steak to order.  Go figure, a steak place that can cook a steak properly.  Hmmm...  The sweet potato loaded is another treat covered in cinnamon butter, brown sugar, caramel sauce and marshmallows.  The green beans are a must try, all cooked with pork, onion... yum.  The rolls are the best.  Soft, sort of sweet, and served up hot with cinnamon butter.    Good thing is you can get a big meal for around $12 a person.  The map on this one is a little off.  This location is in the Target parking lot on the south side of the 202 closer to Ray Road."}
{"text":"How can you say anything bad about Texas Roadhouse?  You just CAN'T!  They are one chain restaurant that you can rely on to be delicious no matter what location you visit.  Let's talk about the location here in Gilbert, AZ.  If there is a wait for a table, which there tends to be most evenings and weekends, grab yourself a handful of some roasted peanuts and flick the shells all over the floor; they don't mind!    When you get to the table, a warm batch of rolls and cinnamon butter gets delivered, but don't stuff yourself on those, the best is yet to come!  I always get the 6oz sirloin cooked medium with a loaded sweet potato (butter, brown sugar, and marshmallows - yum-o!)  and the green beans.  Not just plain old green beans, these melt in your mouth.  Cooked with pork, and onion, oh-ya!   They do have good BBQ, ribs, chicken and some seafood.  But you go to a steakhouse for the steak!  Service is good, birthday celebrations are loud (practice your \"Yee-haws\" before you go!), and the price is right!  My steak with 2 sides runs less than $10! There is a good variety of beer, and a full bar.  Good for families, too.  Round up the family for a rootin' tootin' good time, and some GREAT food!"}
{"text":"One of the best steaks I've ever had.  So juicy and perfect.  I asked for medium rare and they actually did it medium rare.  Friendly servers and this place is busy!  I know chains get a bad rep, but I just had one of the best ribeyes I've ever had.  And you don't know me or why my opinion matters, but I am fat and I'm a fan of food.  Go here!"}
{"text":"Good food ok pricing. You know the atmosphere here. Loud. Not a good place for a date you want to get to know. But for us married folks who can just \"look\" at each other to communicate it is ok. Food is consistent. They prepare steaks EXACTLY as ordered. Bone in ribeye is the only way to go. Yummy!"}
{"text":"This is my First time at Texas Roadhouse,,and I knew I was in trouble,,moment I stepped inside I knew,, because I didn't have my Tony Lama boots. Those who don't know, they are not made of Lama, although some may be but mine are Ostrich,,handmade,,I even told them to leave the Ostrich Feathers on,,makes for great conversation, especially at Church, but not to worry, I only wear them when its my turn to do the Sunday reading. So back to the review.  This place is pretty cool and incredible,, walked in and you won't BELIEVE  this,,but the hostess was 7 FEET TALL!! She greeted us and I freaked out! Then, realized she had to step down from the hostess podium and man, I was relieved! Whew! That would have been the conversation all night long at our table! Everybody else's table too.  Our hostess guides us to our seats (we are a party of 3) and I almost get whiplash when we pass this beautiful showcase filled with hand cut meats! (please see picture) Ok, first star! I mean, come on! When you go to the Supermarket and tell the butcher at the meat counter \"this one waay up front\" don't you secretly wish you could also say, \"can you please fire it up back there, medium rare?\" I know I do.  Wonder if they'll do it? Hmmm... We arrive at the table and notice the restaurants decor is really cool,, wood high beams, neon signs announcing Beers, and lots of TV's (seemed like 30!) Every game being played on Earth was on some TV! Think even a peewee football game was on-going!  So each table had a bucket O' peanuts,, nice; no peanut allergies here!  Tip, if you do have high peanut allergies, stay away, cause you won't leave walking.  Menu was extensive and varied- Second star--If you like STEAK,, they have all kinds of cuts! Ribeye (my fav), Sirloin ( Royalty wooo, Sir Loin), NY Strip, T-Bone (sounds like a rapper). Please Read the menu to know more, as it is impossible to recite the whole thing..Please see picture, thank you.  Our server Miss Jacky was at the helm,, she was fantastic! Third Star- Being our first time here, she was sooo tolerant and patient explaining the entire menu and showing us all the nice photos,, I'm talking really courteous! SHOW ME THE WINE LIST! please,,,  Tip: Miss Jacky even told us about ordering a side of ribs on our entrée for only $6.99 extra,, super deal! Also: **Free appetizer on the Yelp app!! Even the laziest can push the button to get a free appetizer!! Come on!,,, put your finger to good use!! We ordered the Cactus Blossom! Please See picture... I heard Angels sing and Heavenly Trumpets going (but to be fair could have been all the TV's making me Bubble-headed) when I saw,, Bone-in-Rib-Eye ! This entrée comes with 2 sides. Therefore, Our order consisted of:  3  20oz Bone-in's  (easy now)  2 Caesar Salad, 2 baked potatoes, mash and one Garden salad,,, and VINO!!(prices are super reasonable but meager selection) Pretty Epic! (plagiarized this from Yelp since it keeps blinking) ((pictures)) Fourth Star- The taste was way beyond- The steaks were well seasoned and cooked just perfect-medium rare. I did not even salt the darn thing! Happy happy indeed. The baked potato had all the usual suspects,,,butter, sour cream, bacon bits, cheese. All Were Found Guilty! So I lined them up, handed down a sentence, and as punishment, ate the whole thing with a John Wayne squint pilgrim!  Prices? Traumatizing!! Ok,, Wow,, the pricing was so reasonable, it felt like I was robbing the place!! Look at the pic's! I wanted to turn myself in and looked all over the place for the SHERIFF to haul me away, but no sheriff in sight (Guess Bob Marly is in town!) Saw a manager walking around checking! Oh! Is she going to escort me out cause of the way I was ripping and tearing at my meat,, that, or she found out about my Boots? Nope, she was checking in on patrons at the restaurant making sure all was well...Star #5 Altogether, it made for a pleasant dinner! Will definitely be back! Ok so now to do the Star math ( throughout my academic life,, Yes! I went to skool silly!) my professors always used 2 words- Excellent Guess! Made me feel good to hear the word Excellent,,so,equation below: 3 X 2 = 6minus 2 for the weak wine list, carry the 1 for scaring me with the hostess ===TOTAL= 4 Stars!! Plenty of parking! Check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Ryen our waiter was very helpful and attentive. The salad was very fresh and tasty, I had the ribs and they were spot on, I keep forgetting how good TX Roadhouse is for a national chain."}
{"text":"We like Texas Roadhouse.  The one in Tyler TX was our first and we loved it there.  When they came to WI we were very happy.   Great food and wonderful steaks.  Have never had a bad steak here and the prices are more than inexpensive but very affordable and appropriate for a good steak.  It is a little bit crowded here and at all TRs.  The waiter was good but not great.  The place is clean and the bathrooms are clean.  It is noisier than we would like and they do the stupid birthday cheer like other chains.  Hate it.   The waiter didn't go the extra mile and the atmosphere is not as nice as other TRs.  This is why I gave it a 3.  3 of 5 stars for a casual dining, chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I have dined here a few times. The prices are reasonable if not cheap. I have the filet which has been cooked inconsistently half the time.  I like my steak medium and it often will come out rare. I am a bit surprised as the waiter always asks if I like it with a pink warm center. The music is too loud as others have noted.  I had not been here in a while and this time the steak was cooked as ordered."}
{"text":"Was treated out to dinner tonight. The hot buttery bread was great. We didnt have any peanuts. We split the sampler and a burger. It was a lot of food and that burger was piled high with shrooms and onions. The service was quick and the staff public performance was entertaining."}
{"text":"We visited for a Birthday gathering. The Prices & Portions Are Great. The Cinnamon Butter & Rolls Are The Best. The Flavor of my Porterhouse Steak Was Fantastic But They Didn't Cook It To My Requested Temperature Of Medium-Well. Instead I Received Extra Well Done. Also the sides were lacking a bit of flavor. Our Server Was Perfect & Extremely Accommodating. The HeeHaw Part Was Fun."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and it was nice to be able to call ahead and put yourself in line. Unfortunately the the food and quality was very mediocre. The steak was a little bit tasteless itself. However the service from our server was totally excellent."}
{"text":"I think I have been here before...Where is my review from that?  Who knows?  Anyways, we waited 20 mins for a table for 4 on a Saturday night at 7pm.  Not too bad considering the place was PACKED with people.    I wanted prime rib and they are OUT.  Bummer.  So I got the New York Strip with mash potato with cheese and bacon, and buttery corn.  It was good.  The bread and cinnamon butter is the BOMB.  The service was great.  Why the 4 stars?  How can you be out of prime rib?"}
{"text":"Not going to lie. I wasn't impressed. We had a fairly large group so we called ahead. When we got there they said it would be just a few minutes. No big deal. 30 minutes later we finally got our table. We ordered our drinks and food. Saw several other tables get their food before us. An hour later we finally got our food. Thankfully it tasted good. And the only reason they saved themselves and got a 3 instead of lower is because they ended up giving us $40 off our bill for the ridiculously large wait."}
{"text":"Food was good. Fried pickles were okay. Ribs were truly fall off the bone, but OMG t he rolls and cinnamon honey butter were amazing.  Amy, our server was awesome !  Brought back memories of Ground Round in NJ as a kid. Use call ahead seating if you can."}
{"text":"We took our kids here for my son's 13th birthday dinner.  There was a man making balloon figures, and made our son a birthday crown.  Also made the 5 yr. old a spiderman balloon.  Our waitress was nice and very attentive even though they were extremely busy.  Food was amazing!  They made the steaks perfectly and have the best cesar salad ever!  They make their own dressing, steak sauce, even croutons!!!  At the end of the night they made a shout out, announcing my son's birthday and let him sit on a saddle for a photo-op.  All-in-all, a great night and a fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"Best dinner rolls ever! Best butter ever for the delicious rolls. I always want to take some home. Great selection of food. They offer steak, prime rib, chicken, pork chops and even salmon. There is something for everyone. I have had the salmon here and it's really good. I really like that they offer a great selection of sides. And they have gravy. Who doesn't love gravy. The staff is super nice and everyone is very helpful. They really do work as a team. I always enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"We go to Texas Roadhouse for most birthdays.  My kids always want to go so they can sit on the saddle. LOL  The food is usually good and the kids meals are reasonably priced.  However, the food wasn't so good this time around.  My dad ordered the Country Fried Sirloin.  It was anything but a Sirloin!  It was so grisly that he couldn't even chew through it.  It was like eating leather!  The manager came over and replaced it with another one.  I can say that the customer service from the manager was ok.  She came over again to see how his 2nd steak tasted and it was just as bad as the first one.  She gave him an actual sirloin the 3rd time ...which was much better.  Oh and the chili...my husband loves their chili because it has pieces of steak instead of hamburger meat.  But every time he orders it as a side dish, they forget to bring it out before his meal.  He again had to ask the waiter to retrieve his chili.  Their excuse last time was that it comes from another window and nobody is there to run it out to the table.  That's funny...I thought that was our waiter's job.  I don't imagine we will stop going here for special occasions.  I hope the food gets better."}
{"text":"My wife andI decided to have an early diner on Sunday afternoon. It was moderately busy, but still all lot of tables were empty. We were sat a table near the restroom. The table and floor was dirty so I asked the waitress if we could sit somewhere else and she sat us at another table. All good right? Not. She came back and said we would have to sit at the dirty table. She didn't offer to clean it nor even get someone to clean it. She said we would have to sit there. I told her we would just go somewhere else. She said ok. So we left. We have been to this place 15 to 20 times in the 6 years we've lived in the area and have never been treated so poorly. We went to the Thirsty lion and had great service and meal."}
{"text":"Not for us. The bread and butter at the beginning is AMAZING, but the food other than that is just meh. We wouldn't go back. Sure wish some non chain places would open in 85085."}
{"text":"Love the call ahead service. Called in a hour ahead of time and then walked right in. Great service and the food is always amazing! I always get the prime rib but I had the filet last night and it was Perfect!"}
{"text":"So we usually love texas road house (stapley location) but we came to this one because we were in area. It started ok because we went on a Friday night which usually means long wait times but they had us seated in about ten minutes. Then when our server came thats when it started to go down hill she really didnt engage us it was just what do you want and I will get it attitude. Well we all ordered and my father was with us he ordered the half chicken they came back 5-10 minutes later to tell him they did not have any chickens so on a friday night how do you run out of something? it was not even late we ordered around 7:00, so then my dad asked to order a burger cooked medium she said that she couldnt do that its against company policy I am sorry but you are a steak house you cook steaks \"rare\" and you just told him his first choice he cannot have and now he cannot have his burger cooked how he enjoys? The food came and wasnt the best we have ad there my wife couldnt finish her dish which was a bbq pork plate she may have eaten a 1/4 of it, if i were a server that would prompt me to aks if it was ok but no. I had the country fried sirloin the meat tasted ok but the gravy seemed to have maybe three times the normal salt put into it.Also when she served my baked sweet potato the plate seemed to be on fire she said it was warm no this plate was fricken hot and my hand stung the rest of the night. The server asked how the table was once we didnt answer and she moved on.  so yes I will not be going to this location for a while"}
{"text":"While I am a regular at my local Texas Roadhouse I was looking for a late night meal and went for a known commodity. This place provided the same great food and services this chain is known for. I went with the grilled chicken salad and it was good and satisfying. The place here is very well kept and clean and the service provided was great."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite budget friendly steak joint with FREE entertainment lol  I almost always get the sirloin with steak fries and loaded salad. Their rolls and cinnamon butter are to die for, but watch out they are about 400 calories a piece! Someone get me a wheelbarrow because I'm not sharing :)"}
{"text":"Our second visit to this location.  My son and I ordered a half rack of ribs, wife had the rib eye and daughter opted for sliders.   We were seated in the bar which was fine, some might like to know that before going in.     Our waitress was good and the food came out timely considering they were full on a Tuesday night.  Ribs were good, the meat fell off the bone, no need to use your fingers.  Rib eye and sliders got two thumbs up.  Side dishes were a little disappointing... Broccoli was undercooked, not the best baked potato, and the green beans were average at best.   Fresh rolls were too good to be true.  Yummy.  Remarkably we were in and out the door in 45 minutes.  Not in a big hurry to leave but no reason to stay either.  We will visit again, usually about once per year."}
{"text":"We went last night for dinner and it was Amazing!!! Love the call ahead seating and server Samm yes with two M's did a terrific job!!! I thought being that it was brand new would be risky but the food was flavored and cooked to perfection and the service was top notch!!! Way to go Texas Roadhouse!!!"}
{"text":"We visited the Texas Roadhouse in Goodyear, AZ.  We were told there would be a wait of 10-20 minutes, it was actually less than that.  Although it was quite cold in there, it wasn't enough to detract from the experience.  We love the warm bread and the peanuts. The time to order and receive our drinks, salad and dinner was minimal. The waiter, Paul, was fantastic. He got everything right. We were impressed that he was professional without having to write anything down. Although we have yet to get the steak cooked medium well, everything else was perfect.  The salmon and baked potatoes are delicious every time.  My husband and I really just wanted to thank Paul for his outstanding service, his warm and welcoming personality and his attention to detail. Texas Roadhouse must be doing something right to hire and retain someone like Paul. He is the reason we are rating this experience 5 stars."}
{"text":"Only good things about my recent visit was family time, the balloons, and the food.  Our server rushed us throughout the meal, the rolls came with hardly any butter and we did not get to relax and enjoy our celebrations.  We came because we were celebrating two birthdays and an anniversary...  But it turned out we were just taking up space in our servers' section.  I used to love this place, but I don't think I'll ever go back, at least not to this location."}
{"text":"Best steaks at a reasonable price. They are so tender and moist!  The bread with cinnamon butter is to die for.  Salads and side dishes are good as well. Service and wait time can be spotty."}
{"text":"Ordered a sirloin medium with mushrooms. When I received it the steak was cold and we'll as the rubbery mushrooms. I sent it back. Waited 15 mins for another steak. By the time I got my meal my family was finished eating. My second was in a plate of blood and at its best medium rare. I wasn't welling to wait another 15 mins so I ate the outside edges and not the center. I was offered any discount and the manager never addressed the issue. This is the 3rd time in the last 6 months I have sent something back there. I will not return. I can go to The Ribeye and get an all around better meal for about the same price."}
{"text":"I would come here for just the sweet rolls & cinnamon butter! I love how they come right out when you're seated.   I got the chopped steak aka the road kill. It was topped with mushrooms, onions, cheese & I got a side of brown gravy to top it off with. The meat was juicy & cooked perfectly! It went really well with the brown gravy. I normally get the chopped steak from Brown Derby Roadhouse but, this chopped steak is so much better than Brown Derby's. The chopped steak came with 2 sides so, I got the rice & sweet potato. The rice was mushy & tasted off & the sweet potato was also very mushy. I could of skipped both of the sides.  I guess if you come in from open til 6 Monday-Friday's, you can get this meal & other meals for only $8.99 which is a really nice deal."}
{"text":"Eh, Texas Roadhouse.. you break my heart.  If I wrote this review a year ago, there would be no question this would be at least a 4 star spot. But with great popularity, this Texas Roadhouse has lost its way.  The steaks used to be cooked exactly as asked for. I was never disappointed. Now, I often find myself disappointed at what comes out.  Service used to be the best in the area. Now, its just okay. The last two times, I have been lied to about wait times by the front host. The 15 minute waits are not 15 minutes, so beware. You might end up waiting for 45 minutes to 1 hour."}
{"text":"Excellent service and high quality meats. We love this place! Keep it up. They always get the Sirloin right."}
{"text":"Love TR! Probably because it is new there were hiccups.  Very busy for 3:30 on a Saturday.  Our server disappeared on us for about 20 minutes.  We had to pull another over to get us refills.  Wait was not too bad.  Food was good.  I ordered 1/2 BBQ chicken and initially they brought me the 2 small boneless breasts.  Quickly rectified though.   I debated 3 Stars, but I will go with 4 on our history, TR."}
{"text":"Everyone at this location is always so pleasant. Very fun, upbeat environment. Food was delicious as always!"}
{"text":"yum! the food is good. never really busy. The steak isn't really anything to write home about but the atmosphere is cool"}
{"text":"Called in last week to get a usual order we always make, a bone in ribeye cooked medium and a kids Mac and cheese meal. Up until last week we've never had any issues with this place. So anyways, they cooked my steak to hell so I politely called and made sure they took note of it and the girl offered to remake one for me to come pick it up..AGAIN. I declined as it was already late in the evening but said if I could do it next time, she agrees. Called in tonight for our usual order, again. The girl says that it was never noted, nor it was even mentioned to any of the staff what happened. I'm actually appalled that this happened tonight. Definitely not the service I was expecting from such a friendly place. I'll go elsewhere. Thanks."}
{"text":"I had been to this Texas Roadhouse a couple of times before and the food and service was good, but that was not the case tonight. We walked in and stood at the host stand and were never even greeted or acknowledged when there was a host standing three feet away!!! After waiting 5-10 minutes we just gave up and left. Probably not going to come back here again."}
{"text":"Good place to go if you like a fun lively diner. Service is good, food is good and they get it out in a fashionable time."}
{"text":"I was here on Monday night for my moms birthday dinner. I had ordered a chicken salad and when it was brought out there was hardly any chicken on it, no croutons, no egg, and no onion. It looked like it might have been dropped. When the expo brought it out she had said that they were making more chicken for me because there was a \"casualty\". Then our sever came back out and I told him what my salad was missing. He then said that they were just going to remake the whole salad and he then took my dropped salad back.   Definitely seems like they had dropped my food and they were going to let me eat it."}
{"text":"So came back to Texas Roadhouse today & it was like going to another place entirely. Steak was great perfectly cooked & waitress Kari was great. I guess everyone deserves a second chance. Good job Texas Roadhouse"}
{"text":"This review is about 5 days late. The wife and I went there last Saturday, our first time here. I enjoyed the peanuts as you waited for a table.  We were seated fairly fast and our server greated us for drinks. The beer was very cold and in a frosty mug. We ordered the Rib-eye steaks.  They came out in a reasonable time, hot and very good flavor.  Seasoned great and cooked as we ordered. The sides we good and well portioned.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great Service for a place packed to the rafters with customers. The chili is worthwhile to try.  Nice and spicy, a welcome surprise. Fried pickles are very good."}
{"text":"Service is always incredible.  Great staff. Very very attentive and positive. Steaks are reasonably priced and perfectly prepared. Nice char and very flavorful. I am super picky about steak. Roadhouse is consistently excellent. In my opinion,  no other steakhouse can compare."}
{"text":"Never going to eat here again. Planned a nice birthday dinner for a party of 16. Knowing they don't do reservations, we called.early in the day and asked about when we should call.ahead. we were told.call.at 4:30 for a 6:30 time. We called and got on the list and we're told, see you at 6:30. Knowing that we still needed to arrive early, we checked in at 6:20 with 10 of the 16 present  and we're told  it would be 15 mins or so. After waiting about 10 mins we checked in the status. Still had to wait. Keep in mind there is no waiting area and only a few benches outside with what looked like 100 people waiting. Waited about 10.mins more and asked again. This time they said the party was done eating at the table there were just waiting for them.to leave. They could sit is back to back or across an Isle  if we wanted quicker seating but said maybe another 10 mins. I was like I called 2 hours ago to get the long table so we would.wait. another 15 mins goes by and we are starving. We have been getting bumped into by staff and customers because there is no.where to stand. My husband goes to get some peanuts after they finally filled the bin and was almost body-checked by a staff member retreating peanuts for a table. He was like hey watch out and was barked.at by the server. He went to ask.about the table again. Now 45 mins after the time we asked about and the peach of a manager, Kelly, asked what the problem was. He said we had a reservation, which he didn't really know the call ahead thing and was quickly told they don't make reservations in a condescending manner and at any rate told the man we had been waiting a very long time.for calling so far in advance. He also mentioned the rude incident with the peanuts.  Next thing I know my husband walls out and says we can't eat there. The manager was no longer going to swat us because we were harassing his hostess! Seriously, asking about a wait is harassment? I was so embarrassed. What was I going to do with 16 people on a Friday night after we waited nearly an hour  already to be seated. I told the pager inside and he smirked and told name to have a nice night! Really, this was my birthday dinner. Thanks for ruining it.  I will.never eat here again.  UPDATE: I called customer service and they had the owner contact me about the situation.  Ultimately he apologized and asked me to please have dinner for my family on him at one of his other restaurants. I agreed and waited about 2 weeks to get the vouchers.  Keep in mind the manager turned away 16 of us!  I got 2 vouchers for dinner for 2 up to $30 value.  That's all good but I have 5 people in my family and so now I have to decide who gets to go, or pay money to eat a meal that is supposed to be comped as a gesture!  And what about the other 12 people who were with us that night, my elderly parents, my brother and his family, my nephew and his wife.  They still all experienced the same thing as I did. Oh and what about my free birthday appetizer, guess I don't get that either!  Still not happy but I guess they \"tried\""}
{"text":"Good food, but the atomosphere is a little on the YEEHAW!! side.  It's best to go before 5pm unless you like huge crowds and waiting for a table for an extremely long time."}
{"text":"My 4 year old and I have been coming here regularly for months. Sadly we are moving out of state to CA. Hopefully there's a Texas Roadhouse by us. This location has excellent service, quality food and the legendary bread and peanuts."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday withwife, son & his wife were to meet us. The waitress Savannah, seemed nice & pleasant. Told here we were waiting for other two to arrive. Ordered a beer as right away, wife hadn't decided yet so she ran & got my beer. Came back and waited while my wife was still deciding, she hurried up to order as she wasn't going to ask if she needed more time soy wife just ordered something. Our other members showed up within 5 minutes, and as soon as they sat dow she returned, and asked if we were ready to order. I said we'll have an appetizer, and they hurriedly ordered a drink. She returned quickly with app & drinks and asked if ready to order again, I had checked menu previously, wife and company hadn't checked. We said,could you give us a minute. She returned in a minute, maybe 2, we had no time to talk amongst ourselves, so I ordered while everyone else were quickly trying to decide, while she waited. Obviously we weren't ready but she wasn't leaving or asking about more time. Again they hurriedly ordered. Service was decent. And she returned w/check when we were 2/3 finished with our meal. I understand, the more tables you can flip on your shift, the more money you can make. She's a good waitress, but rushing customers through their entire meal is not going to get much of a big tip. The burgers seemed nice the two poeple at are party said they were good. My country tips dinner, not good, every bit of steak was fatty. Kind of ruins the meal. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"Today was my last visit to this location -it was not pleasant. My husband and I visited and we did expect a wait because it was a Saturday evening, no problem there. My issue was that several people were seated before us but they had arrived after us. After this happened about 3-4 times I asked about it. I was told that all of those people had called ahead to get in the wait list. I was surprised by that but returned to my bench to wait. Then, the couple next to us was \"buzzed\" on the pager after having arrived about 5 mins before, they commented on how fast it was. I asked if they had called ahead, they said no. Coincidentally we were called next. When we were seated I asked for the manager. When she came over I explained what happened. She proceeded to explain how the \"call ahead\" program works. I was not confused about how the program works - I was frustrated that the people next to me told me they didn't call ahead but were seated first. She was very uninterested in my concerns and dismissive towards me so I just gave up. Now, jumping to my meal - it was not enjoyable. I had chicken with canned gravy on it and vegetables that were nearly raw. (My husband was content with his meal.) I didn't complain about the food because that seemed useless. In the end I did not have a good experience, I tried to address it and that made it worse, I then ate my less than enjoyable food and now I'm home with a stomach ache. Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service was ok. Bone in ribeye cooked to perfection . Great overall experience Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was a surprise.  I've eaten here a few times, and the food and service have been pretty good although drink refills were pretty slow and the front entry where the peanut barrels were was a mess. Bathrooms are not always well maintained.  My last visit was an embarrassment.  I brought family here who go to Texas Roadhouse  (TR) regularly back home in Virginia.  Our server that night was extremely rude and arguementative.  My cousin has a severe pork allergy and his wife is kosher.  We were asking about potatoe preparation. She told us that both white and sweet potatoes were rubbed with pork fat.  Since I have only eaten here a few times I don't really know.  My cousin's wife was shocked. She says she eats at TR all the time and said her TR doesn't use pork fat on the sweet potatoes. At this point instead of offering to double check or get a manager or offer to ask if her potatoe could be prepared without pork fat, our server proceeded to tell us how she knows they do rub them with pork fat. Includibg adding that she used to own a TR.  Really??!?? And now you are a server, not a manager or new owner. Interesting... Not a reassurance and definitely a rude and condescending way to handle a customer concern. My cousin's wife was angry.  We salvaged the rest of our visit, but were completely appalled at our server. After this exchange, our food was mixed up. Our sides were forgotten. Drinks went unrefilled.  It was deplorable service.  Food once we got it was good, but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I may try a different location since this was so bad, even though this is is so much closer.  Too bad.  I see others have been complaining about their service. I hope this location cleans up their act."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty great, the prices are reasonable and the wait was only about 15 mins on a busy night. Not bad at all. My favorite part of my visit was our waitress Giselle (I think that's how you spell it, lol) she was on top of everything and very sweet. I'll be eating here again soon hopefully I get her again."}
{"text":"Another year, another birthday. Was looking for place to get a steak and my Mom pulls out a $25 gift certificate to Texas Roadhouse. I've heard of the place, but had never been. A little research shows me that they score pretty high on Yelp and in national rankings. We had excellent service from the moment we walked in. To start, I ordered a frozen margarita (hey it's my birthday after all), which was fantastic. I ordered the 20 oz ribeye, medium with a baked potato and house salad. The wife ordered chicken fried steak with green beans and mashed potatoes. The house salad was ok, came with hard boiled eggs (not a fan). The ribeye came out and was cooked perfectly. Was it the best steak I've ever eaten? No, but it was pretty darn good. Cooked just as requested and super juicy. The baked potato was also delicious. My wife reported that not only was her chicken fried steak delicious, but she liked it better than her all time favorite at Cracker Barrel.  She loved her sides too.    Ended the meal with the chocolate brownie, which I wasn't terribly impressed with (lactose intolerant, so I had to avoid the ice cream). Overall a great experience and a very convenient location (right next to the movie theater), may be our new dinner and a movie spot!"}
{"text":"I hope this was unusual for this place as I have note had this messed up service before. Waitress took exceptionally long to get to table after we were seated, we requested a table and I have to admit that we received one, however it was so small that with the peanut buckets, menus, and all the advertising, condiments, etc there really was no room for food one the drinks were brought.  Order was taken, salads brought were not only not as ordered but wrong dressing on both. Sent waitress for correct dressing, before she returned 2 more salads brought out by different server, which were correct. Finished salad only to have yet another server bring out 2 entrees that we didn't order. Correct order finally arrives with no place on table to put them as the tiny table had not been cleared of salad plates. Food was as expected, typical of a chain. Steaks were actually cooked perfect to order.  I believe if they had only one person waiting a table the mix ups would not occur. We had at least 4 different servers and I do not believe any of them were communicating with each other which is why so many mix ups occurred. I would give 1 1/2 stars if possible only gave 2 because when correct order finally arrived it was well cooked and tasted good. Service needs serious help."}
{"text":"Great food yelp app helped us get in line before we left the house"}
{"text":"Worst trh location. U call ahead for seating and wait close to 45 minutes for a table the waitresseses are little girls with attitude worst location to eat at but its a crummy side of town so"}
{"text":"This has got to be my favorite spot to eat since I moved to Glendale AZ! My god their food is amazing! Steaks are the best but the baby back ribs are to die for! Literally \"fall off the bone!\" Good price for good food and employees are always in a great mood! Good family atmosphere! Will forever be my special occasion restaurant to go to! Gotta love BBQ!"}
{"text":"My review is probably biased. This is not my type of restaurant to start off. However, if you like loud and obnoxious type of restaurant settings then this is the restaurant for you. It was very chaotic and I wasn't fan of the demographic of people. It seemed that it was only older caucasians that came here and were looking at me at a very judging manor. Also, there is a long wait even if you call ahead so beware. I don't think I will come back.       On the otherhand, from what I ordered-the rattlesnake bites and brownie were very good. The rattlesnake bites doesn't actually have rattlesnake and they are basically fried cheese and jalapeño balls but the cheese is gooey and melts deliciously. The brownie is a hot brownie with ice cream and is very good. However, I got the pulled pork dinner for my main meal and to be frank, it was mediocre. I would recommend Pittsburgh Barbecue Company over Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"First off, got there at a good time. Went there once before & there was an hour wait for a table. We didn't have an hour to wait.  Very nice wait staff. Received fresh-baked rolls as we were taken to our table:very tasty. My wife had a grilled chicken salad that she said was very good & was too big for her to finish. I had the smokehouse burger: WOW! Very large &  extremely delicious.   Will return, hopefully soon."}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  I came in for prime rib on a Sunday at about 4 and they were out. They were unwilling to offer me a substitute and the manager was a total jerk.  The server brought me sweet tea after I asked for unsweetened tea.  I am diabetic and sugar could kill me. I say avoid this place.  What a joke. I walked out and went to Cracker Barrel next door."}
{"text":"Went to another Birthday dinner with my family. We had a great cactus blossom, watched sports, and drank beer. Overall a good time! I got to sit in the saddle, and got a whooping Yeehaw! Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Great food and fabulous service. The food was hot and delicious. They were busy, but my server kept the drinks full and made sure that we were taken care of. We tipped 25% and wished that I could have given more!"}
{"text":"Good location and nice food! Enjoyed my steak and would go there again when I stay in Glendale"}
{"text":"We were very excited to see a Texas Roadhouse coming to within 2 miles of our house.  We went to the opening on May 11th and it was awesome.  I had 12oz piece of prime rib.  It was the best I'd ever had.  The salad was great, the rolls were fantastic, and the cheese fries were out-of-this-world.  We went again the 17th and a restaurant has never made a faster 180 degree turn.  I wanted some more prime rib.  I ordered medium and it came to me with grill marks and no cooking.  As raw as could be.  My wife's was a little better but not medium either.  The waitress took my wife's back to the kitchen and left mine in front of me.  About 5 minutes later, the manager came over and asked what was wrong.  I told him I'd ordered medium and got raw.  He agreed and took it back.  About 20 minutes later, he brought back the same piece of meat and although better, it was still purple on the inside.  He said he was sorry and asked me if I wanted something else.  I asked for BBQ chicken.  It came out in about 5 minutes and it was good.  The manager said he would wipe it from the bill.  I had already given the waitress a coupon for a free appetizer.  The bill finally came and I noticed that I was charged for 2 prime ribs and even the appetizer.  I told the waitress about the bill and it took her about 15 minutes to fix the check.  All in all, we were there for a little over two hours.  DEFINITELY NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE."}
{"text":"Is the place to be. I went there on a sunday expecting it to be calm and mellow instead the place was a full house,I end up waiting 15 mins to be seated assuming it was gonna take for ever jus to order and eat but i was wrong. Our Server was \"FANTASTIC\" never once i had to ask for a refill. My new york steak strip was right on the money and my salad was fresh. Love this place good atmosphere great service and good beer."}
{"text":"We had a meal with our family last night (party of 9) and we actually seated in the bar area within 15 minutes which was a pleasant surprise. Raina was our server and was very pleasant and attentive, I fortunately a large glass of beer was spilled all over the table saturating mine and my significant others clothing. Accidents happen and I am ok with that, however disappointed in how the incident was handled. Raina was very apologetic however a manager never graced their presence at our table to follow up or offer any service recovery. Half of the family's meal came out at least 15 minutes prior to the rest and I honestly have to say that two of the prime rib plates were dissatisfying and tasted like \"ham\" and the rest of the plates were just mediocre. The final check came and there was no discount at all until we mentioned something about the incident. Raina took the check, returned and the one beer was removed.  We paid and left an adequate tip. I work with the public in healthcare and it is our policy to attempt service recovery and I'm sure thy is the case in the restaurant business. In fact, I have dined in numerous restaurants and witnessed the managers rounding on tables just to make sure service, food etc was good. I don't expect to have a fill meal for nine people taken care of, however I do expect at least a minimum of a supervisors presence and offer to provide some sort of discount. Needless to say, very disappointed with this restaurant and based on this experience I would definitely opt for another restaurant in this location."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was at best pathic, kitchen manager and entire staff should be fired. Not a single entree came out at ordered, by the time it was corrected  the rest of the food was cold. Don't waste your time or money, too many other places to eat that are better choices."}
{"text":"My family and I are regulars here and we absolutely love it. The hostesses are so friendly and always bubbly, which is refreshing from all the other restaurants where hostesses look and act like they are miserable. Any way back to the point. From the moment you walk in you feel welcomed. The wait staff is just as inviting!!     Now. Let's talk food!! The bread is probably my favorite bread in the entire universe. I have to give credit to the butter that comes with it but hey give me some bread and butter and I'm happy!! My kids would only eat that if I let them, and if I didn't feel like I might be judged by the surrounding tables. We usually don't get an appetizer cause we all know what we want, and instant gratification is kind of our thing. I always order the Road Kill, medium well, with a side salad and baked potato. My husband is always trying a different steak. The food is always seasoned well and just well prepared. Texas Roadhouse is a well oiled machine that is a good restaurant that will get it right!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!!! The food and service was way better than expected. I've had Texas Roadhouse in Utah, and wasn't as pleased as I have from here. The food was fresh, the beverages remained topped off, the rolls...the famous rolls were hot and perfect. Fresh tasking food, great service, great location, and a fun time. Will for sure go back here. Great job and keep up the great work. Thanks for a great dinner and I look forward to seeing you all again soon."}
{"text":"I normally stay away from \"themed\" restaurants but Texas Roadhouse has a really cozy atmosphere and good food. I usually get the half roast chicken and a Coors Light and my evening ends up being great. Service has always been great and I love the house steak sauce. Actually, I can't get enough of it. It's the best steak sauce around I'd say but then again I'm a saucy kinda guy. I've been to this location as well as the Arrowhead one and I'd rate them equally."}
{"text":"Ate here last night. Everything was excellent. Great food, good seating, and wonderful service. Our food came out hot and how we ordered it. Chopped steak with everything on side. They were smart to put the mashed potatoes and gravy in a bowl, so it does not go on everything else. Chicken critters were hot, crispy, and not greasy. One steak was not cooked enough. It was quickly taken away back to the grill. The manager brought it back to make sure everything was alright. Nice move on their part.They were very busy and our server was spot on. She kept up with all our needs. We have not been here in years. Usually go to a different roadhouse.  So glad we tried it. We will be going again, and soon. Thanks for the great experience, keep it up."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times over the past year hoping something would of changed, BUT each time had HORRIBLE experience!!  Not once out of those 3 times was my meal ever correct. I usually order a steak medium and it's never been right once, either undercooked or burnt to a crisp. Had to have it redone and finally get it after everyone else was done eating.  Not Cool!!!  Plus they've forgotten a side dish. You go out to dinner with family and friends to enjoy things together. Not once did the manager come over to apologize or offer to comp.  Been to other restaurants and they bend over backwards with apologies. I'd never recommend anyone to go there or would never go back myself.  The servers we've had were very slow and hardly came around.  I'd pick Outback over Texas Roadhouse. May cost a little more but they really care about their customers and get things right!!"}
{"text":"First time here and I have to say this place is absolutely amazing Becky was our server and she knocked it out of the park! very friendly and knowledgeable about their steaks. Our appetizers came to us and everything just melts in your mouth with a massive amount of flavor. I can't believe I've been missing out on great food and staff. Thank you for making an absolute great first impression you will see us more often!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT. This was my 5th time there and each time is better than the time before. Food and service outstanding. I went with the burger this time, never disappointing. Our server, Jaclyn was great, very attentive. Can't wait to get back there. Ribs and pulled pork combo also a great choice."}
{"text":"The food is great here and the price is reasonable. They give you complimentary warm rolls with apple butter. My only complaint is that when my family and I are waiting for our table, there are plenty of benches to sit on but there are a lot of people sitting with us that smoke cigarettes and E cigarette. There needs to be a designated smoking area away from the front door and away from families with children."}
{"text":"If you like being sat right next to the bar with two kids, this is the place for you!   How about a waitress who shoves a plate at you because she's too self centered and oblivious to your space to care that the plate's in your face -- a hot one at that.  Refill on a soda? Forget about that! And we were right next to the bar! How does that work out?  The food is always good, but the service needs major work."}
{"text":"Good food at very reasonable prices. Just stumbled upon this place, glad we did. Ask for waiter named Matthew, hes the best!!"}
{"text":"The food was great! My wife is not a steak eater and enjoyed her steak. Bone in rib eye was the best steak i have had in a while. Servers were friendly and attentive. My only knock on the place is that we were sat next to a table that had a table added on to it and made things very tight. Actually it was quite awkward at times for both parties. Other than that, we are looking forward to our next visit!!"}
{"text":"Tonight my husband and I came here to eat dinner. We asked how long the wait was when we were told 20-30 minutes. We made a reservation 30 minutes out so we wouldn't have to stay and wait. Upon coming back the girl hands us a beeper and says it'll be another 10-15 minutes. Ironically the beeper says \"call ahead to reserve\" Reserving did us a lot of good. I also mention they were dancing, singing, and pointing vs. working. Literally. Oh and while we were told to wait longer, they were seating other guest. Fuck this place."}
{"text":"I really like coming to Texas Roadhouse. The bread is awesome (buttery, but awesome). They have a few good dishes but I personally love the ribs. They are extremely tender and slide right off the bone. Would highly recommend this order."}
{"text":"First I would like to say that our sever was wonderful.  Our party was sat in the time allotment that was given to us.  I ordered a sirloin steak well done along with a sweet potato on the side.  When I received my steak it was dark red when I cut into it, also the potato that was served was undercooked and hard to cut into.  I talked to the server who apologized and took the plate back.  20 minutes later I had still not been served.  I asked the server about my plate since my friends had already finished their food.  He said that since my steak was so rare it is taking a long time to cook.  When I was finally served, I was given a steak that was so black in color and hard.  It looked like charcoal.  The manager had just dropped it off without saying a word.  I asked to talk to him again and he said if its over done he could give me au jus.  I declined and asked to have the meal removed from the  ticket.  This manager never apologized. The waiter even said wow I can't believe that this steak was seen by three people and still served.  I am sad to say that this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had.  It was so late by the time we settled the bill I couldn't eat after that.  Just extremely disappointed!"}
{"text":"The only mistake was going on a Friday night. This place was packed. Waited an hour (not sure I would do that again). I have been here a few times. Food is good (not great) but consistent. You know exactly what your getting. Service was slow. And this place is loud. Screaming kids, yelling servers and loud music. So if you don't mind those things and am looking for something you can count on, them this could be it."}
{"text":"We stopped in here as a meeting place to meet my wife's nieces. It is a place that is active and a noise level that can get loud. If you are looking for something quiet, you might want to go somewhere else. We all hard the lunch special 6 ounce sirloin. Cooked the way I ordered it, the steak was good. Baked potato didn't have enough sour cream but it was my fault for not asking for more. The lunch special was price correct for the serving size. Don't forget the peanuts!"}
{"text":"A reminder of why I rarely go to chain restaurants anymore. This was HORRIFIC. The food came out burnt twice. The server knew it was burnt. Service was extremely slow. FOOD WAS TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"Rolls were very good as usual. The Saladin was over cooked and the vegetables were not cooked, it was like eating raw carrots and broccoli. The bartenders were very nice and can dance."}
{"text":"I ordered a southern grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and a side salad. We had a cactus blossom as the appetizer. The food was very good. The waitress was very polite and had an excellent attitude."}
{"text":"If it's a Saturday night, call early and make a reservation. I've been to TR in FTW and this is my first stop at the one in AZ.  Waited 45 minutes for a table but it was  weekend and spring training so... Food was good and service was as well. Wish they had a better selection of craft beers on tap but oh well.  A good place to go for good steaks/ribs at a decent price."}
{"text":"Always visit a Texas Roadhouse whenever there is one close. Never had a bad steak or ribs and the beer selection is usually pretty good although this one didn't carry more than one IPA  Service is always good and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This is a recent gem I discovered on the west side.  I let my friend pick a spot for us to dine and this is the chosen one.  I was thinking---BBQ.  When I stepped through the door we were greeted with glossy dinner rolls- SOOOO DELISH! Such a fun environment.  My only complaint is the music were TOO loud! My friends and I were screaming at each other.  What's Good? -Double blossom: hand-battered onion, golden-fried, and served with our Cajun Horseradish sauce. -HOUSE Margarita -Ceasar Salad: it was done just right! I love it! I'm a meat girl but I commend the salad- so that must say something this dish. -Grilled Salmon: A fillet salmon steak, grilled moist and tender and topped with our special lemon pepper butter- add a couple drop of fresh lemon squeeze- and BAM! perfect dish. -Waitress line dancing to a song- although the girls look like they were forced (you can tell on their face).  I think it's a good change and that's what makes Texas Roadhouse so fun!  The NOs: -Loud music -Pulled Pork sandwich:  too dry  What makes my experience at Texas Roadhouse even greater was our waitress Jessica.  She has such a sweet smile and knowing that it was our first time there she went over the menu with us and was being very courteous about it.  She was also the only one smiling when all the waitress got out to line dance.  That's what makes Jessica so cool!  Such a fun restaurant!"}
{"text":"Fun celebrations. Happy staff and a fun, ready to serve attitude. Maybe that's why thus chain can handle being sandwiched between On one bey 2 major steakhouse players.  Just a team worth giving a real shot to wow you"}
{"text":"Always huge, yummy portions. The green beans are the greatest thing that's ever happenedto me."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Our server, Fernando, was EXCELLENT! Very attentive, excellent timing of food, excellent customer service! The food was very good too! It did get a little loud from time to time from other customers around us. Nevertheless, the crew went out of their way to make the experience as good as it could be! We were there late too - till after closing and the crew never appeared in a hurry or irritated about that. They continued to provide excellent service and made us feel welcomed, despite the time. That's the mark of a GREAT crew!"}
{"text":"We stop here every time we come to Arizona. I ordered the pork chops and they were very moist and tender. I love Texas red chili because it doesn't have beans and the heat is perfect!  Service was great too."}
{"text":"I visit this Texas Roadhouse 2-3 times a month. More often than not, I have good food and good service. I wish they hadn't switched all but two of their tables to booths. If you're fluffier than a skinny person, the booths are not comfortable. Other than that, it's one of my regular spots where I can count on getting a good meal."}
{"text":"One my favorite restaurants. I'm from Texas. So it's always good to have a go to place for a wonderful meal. That you know will be great every time you eat there."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 30+ people after a graduation that didn't have plans on eating somewhere after the commencement.  I live on the opposite side of town and would never come to this Texas Roadhouse for lunch/dinner.   I will say....I was very impressed.  This restaurant not only accommodate the entire party, but the staff was awesome.  Although, we couldn't all sit at one table they gave a section and we took over several tables.  The staff was accommodating, patient, courtesy and friendly.    Food-great selection on the menu.  I think in our party alone we ordered one of everything from the menu.  I am not a chained restaurant person, so I ordered a classic burger  to be on the safe side, it was awesome!  Someone else in our party ordered their sweet potatoes and they were delicious.  My son is a mac n cheese guy...and it came out cold he had to send it back, but it wasn't an issue.  They were very accommodating.    All in all, I was very impress with the staff and how they handle our 30+ party situation.  Kudos, to the staff for being so friendly, accommodating and very patient.  I will seek out a Texas Roadhouse -East Valley.  In the future, if some asks let's try Texas Roadhouse, I won't say no."}
{"text":"Great service super friendly and  And a thank you to our server yoly Now let's Talk about the food steak and shrimp amazing love myself some Surf and turf"}
{"text":"I realize \"Texas Road House\" actually has nothing to do with Texas (as they are based in Minnesota) but come on, beans in the chili, there are no beans in chili that is chili with beans. I ordered chili and had to give that bean laced concoction back to them.  They ran out of rare and medium rare prime rib before 6:10 pm. Very disappointing!!!  Why do they not even carry Dr Pepper, the only soft drink from Texas??? Chain wide they substitute a nasty coca cola product called mr pibb that bears no taste resemblance to Dr Pepper, in Texas we call that bait and switch!  Friendly staff, quick service and the sirloin is much more than tolerable! Love the bread and cinnamon laced spread (butter would be better) usually the bread you are seated with is not as warm as the bread refills so wait and get it fresh from your server.  This was the best close selection to the hotel for a -17 degree evening. Pleasantly quiet for a TRH! Looking forward to getting home to the local TRH on the north side of Fort Worth, w/o beans in the chili!!!"}
{"text":"Checked in around 6pm they told us it would be an hour and 15 minute wait. Ended up waiting nearly 2hours and every time i went up to go ask they said 10-15 more minutes. On top of that the manager that we talked to was very rude. I love coming to Texas Roadhouse but i will not be returning to this location. Such a horrible experience."}
{"text":"This is the second time Ive called in an order and it always takes forever and a day for someone to come to the phone. I always end up calling twice and being put on hold. If you're that busy hire another person for to go orders. The person that took the order added an additional meal to my order so when I picked it up it was more money that I was ready for. However that wasn't the issue, the issue is CUSTOMER SERVICE. The manager (Tiki) had to come and override the order and when she came out she didn't even speak let alone look in my direction. Lead by example manager.  Nice enough the girl at the register (Natalie) apologized for the error (it's the little things). She's the only reason they received 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"Frequent customers at the Peoria location. Quality of food is always good. Service is adequate. Wish they would stop the \"canned\" conversations from staff to patrons- i.e- just as soon as you round the corner- same question- how is your day so far? Servers great you with the same greeting..hello my name is.. i will be taking care of you today, Would you like a legendary margarita? Cold beer? Coke Products? Set drinks..would you like an appetizer. Even if you are asking a question they stay on script and do not listen. Very robotic. Today- the hostess- yep-scripted. Server- Rebecca- Was not scripted but really knowledgeable, personable, efficient and welcoming."}
{"text":"I will never come here again. The waitress was nice but in not helpful. My husband ordered the catfish and it wasn't good nor was it fully cooked. He clearly didn't eat it at all and were still charged for it. We went at 8:30 at night so it wasn't busy. Everyone there was very unprofessional; on their phones and having conversation that customers shouldn't hear. My dish was good, salty but ok. Overall, not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently good and the wait times are consistently long so they must be doing something right.  Never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Love the environment- music, beer signs, tv w/ sports, great prices, especially on draft beers, and okay tasting steaks. Really cool that you can make a mess on the floor w/ the peanuts. Friendly servers and staff."}
{"text":"Was told 15 to 25 minutes for a table. Was seated in 5. Our server, Steve, took really good care of us. Always had drink refills before we asked. Portions are huge. Steaks done exactly the way we ordered. Seasoned just right. Mushrooms were more than just others butter and mushrooms. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place will surely send you home on a full and satisfied stomach.  I ordered the steak and rib combo with the loaded mashed potatoes.  The ribs were definitely my favorite.  I've had better, but these were decent.  I really enjoyed the dinner rolls with the cinnamon butter.  It's that killer sweet tooth that I just can't seem to kick.  Excellent service.  The manager came by to welcome me as a first timer.  Gave me a card for a free appetizer on my next visit.  Now that's customer service!"}
{"text":"I love this Texas Roadhouse. Every other TR I've been to has a cramped lobby and you are waiting 30-45mins for a table. This location is fairly busy, yet we get sat quickly each time. The staff at this location is always friendly too!   On to the food... I am a creature of habit here and the food is consistent at each location. The rolls, the warm wonderful awesome butter rolls; no better way to start a meal. Anyways, I always start with the Cactus Blossom, that horseradish concoction is delicious. I opt for the house salad. The house made dressings are on point, but I wish they'd make french already. I know I'll upset a bunch of folks, but I like my steak well done. TR is one of the few places where my filet arrives with no pink and doesn't look like a hockey puck. My favorite side is the loaded bake potato. What's not to love about a coarsely salted potato smothered in sour cream, cheddar cheese and bacon?    So basically this is my go to place for a steak dinner. You get good food, great service and it doesn't cost more than my car payment."}
{"text":"This place is like a well-oiled machine. We came in at 12:15 in Father's Day and were seated immediately by a friendly, roll-holding hostess. Our waitress was friendly but service was very fast. Everything came out as ordered and at a quick pace - important when you have a 2 year old on a schedule! Great lunch, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to at least 35 different Roadhouses and you get the same great food at all of them.  Ralph"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends who wanted to buy us dinner so we were limited in sending back food but we both would have sent back the steak. It was an 8oz sirloin that was cooked spot on med rare but had a ton of salt on it, flavor was lost in the salt, if we order steak again we'll ask for no salt just seasoning. The salads are very good.   BTW for those who advertise \" fall of the bone ribs\" they are way overcooked if they fall off the bone, it's no longer tender but mushy instead."}
{"text":"Atmosphere very upbeat, good food and great service!! The hot, hot butter rolls are so addicting with that cinnamon butter! I think I ate about half dozen of those and almost needed a wheelchair to get out to my car. Definitely recommend this restaurant.."}
{"text":"Customer service is lacking.  Received a beeper and told it would be a 10-20 minute wait last night.  I started walking towards the bar to wait for our table and the manager asked me where I was going.  He thought I was going back to seat myself at a table.  While at the bar I saw several available tables and asked about them.  Apparently some sections were not available for seating because they didn't have enough servers.  After what seemed like a long time at the bar, I went back to check on our table.  The hostess, VERY SMUG, said you have been waiting 17 minutes only and I said 10-20!  Any place else would have apologized for the wait, rather than acting smug about being correct about the 20 minutes.  We finally got our table and the waitress brought cold rolls.  We ate them because we were starving.  The waitress took our empty basket and didn't come back with more.  We had to ask about more rolls.  When she brought them, they were cold again.  We asked for hot ones which she did finally come back with.  The rolls are what people come for!  The service last night was very disappointing.  Normally we sit at the bar but because there was 4 of us, we wanted a table.  There are many restaurants in the area.  One shouldn't have to put up with a snooty hostess and bad service."}
{"text":"I was on vacation so I stuck to the familiar restaurant scene. Excellent service, food and drink! Parking was easy to come by as well."}
{"text":"My service was typical at this location disappointing. Once again, I tried the filet and it was doused with a lb of butter. I would rather eat at home. Also, my desert, the apple pie I think was bought at a discount from Walmart. Absolutely pathetic. Please consider other steakhouses other than this Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"One of my favorite steakhouses because it has quality meat that's prepared perfectly, all for a reasonable price! And words can't describe how dang good those complimentary yeast rolls with cinnamon/honey butter are! Service here is great, I visit at least once a month."}
{"text":"We first became aware of Texas Roadhouse in Waco Texas. We have since eaten at 6 different locations. Love the consistency from place to place. The dining room has a fun honky tonk feel with the bar and televisions in the middle. The steaks are always tender and well prepared and the choices of sides are good (salad, baked/mashed/sweet potatoes, green beans etc) But those warm yeast rolls...They start you off with a fresh basket and just keep them coming. This is the place to carbo-load. It's hard to stop eating them. The best thing about Roadhouse besides the good food is the value. My 8 ounce sirloin dinner with 2 sides and all the rolls I can stuff myself with is only $12.49. Hard to beat that price for a complete steak dinner."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. If you call ahead the wait isn't bad. Yummy steaks for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"great service but worst meal i have ever experienced. filet so raw we brought it home and cooked it. chicken fried sirloin had so much grizzle  half was not edible. gravy and side of corn were so salty it ruined the meal. never again"}
{"text":"We been eating here for the past 11 years.  Everything is good, the only thing is the wait when you come at a buzzy hours.this is why it's only 4 stars. If they send out coupons for coming at slow hours I'm sure they will be buzzy all the time.  We come here 2-3 times a week."}
{"text":"We go here every once and a while. Never disappointed. The service is always good. The steaks are usually cooked to the correct temperature.   The thing that I always look forward to is the bread. Mmm. It's just so warm and tasty."}
{"text":"Let me tell you how much I love Texas Roadhouse.. or maybe I shouldn't because I could go on forever.   As far as chain restaurants go, this has to be my favorite. So let's discuss why; first and foremost, THE BREAD IS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER HAD. No exaggeration. I could eat that stuff all day. I don't care for the cinnamon butter stuff too much but my boyfriend really enjoys it.  I used to only get their caesar salad, (which by the way is amazing too) but then I finally started to branch out and try other things.  I have not been let down yet.  Another awesome thing about this place is that the employees are all super nice and friendly and you can tell that they don't completely loathe their jobs... which is nice.   So, Texas Roadhouse, I will continue to dine here with you for many years to come."}
{"text":"Dinner w/ Lesley, Savannah and Ava.  Why 5-stars? Easy...Place is packed and they still get us seated in less than 15 mins. Server (Faith) arrives before we even open our menus. Great smile and very personable.   Dinner was better than expected, best sirloin around. For the critics, I didn't want a filet. Their sirloin is perfect for a midweek steak craving or perfect for a guy not eating carbs!   Cooked to perfection (medium) covered in sautéed mushrooms (what I like best is they are fresh mushrooms and no onions mixed in). Topped off with a skewer of grilled shrimp. The deal with Texas Roadhouse is you can ALWAYS count on great food, great service, and a management team floating throughout the restaurant. Perfect dinner tonight, thanks guys!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here coming in from Las Vegas and we love this restaurant so luckily we found one! The staff are so very friendly and attentive and even the manager checked on us! The food was great! We ordered the steak tips and the steak salad.. yummy!!!   But the most impressive was what we noticed outside. There was parking spots with signs for Combat Wounded parking. My boyfriend and I were in awe and never have seen that. My boyfriend is a Combat Veteran after serving in the US Army for 26 years. So it was very touching to see that posted.   Thank you Texas Roadhouse. We will return back to Vegas and share the wonderful experience and how your company pays tribute to those who have fought for our freedoms."}
{"text":"Super bummed!! My hubby and I came here today for an impromptu date and we didn't even stay. When we walked in they were on a 20 - 25 minute wait. We gave our name but only waited about 10 minutes! I guess they failed to mention the rest of your wait time is at the table! We sat, and, sat, and sat, aaaaaaand sat! 2, 3, 4 different people walked right by our table and not one person even acknowledged we were there. The kicker...there was a table eating directly behind us and their server was present!! Why couldn't that person have said hi, or taken drinks etc. Nope, nothing, from anyone!! We sat long enough to eat the basket of rolls and decided to leave. I mentioned it to what appeared to be the manager on our way out bit he could have cared less. He offered to \"get us sat\" and I let him know again, we WERE sat, for 12 minutes!  We had zero service. Too bad, we won't be back."}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night four of us. We were sat in a timely manner. My mom was elderly and wouldn't you know it they sit us in the far back. Before seating people maybe you should check the party out. Food was great no complaints. However, there were 6 servers standing around talking by the order machine in the back. They weren't putting orders in to the machine, they were just talking and having social hour. My husband had to ask for refills I'm not sure what happened to our waitress we never saw her again until it was time to pay the bill. I saw the manager stop by at the table across from us due to there order having an issue. But she didn't ask anyone else how it was going. My rating will be on customer service."}
{"text":"I am updating my rating from a 4 to a 5 based on value alone.  We bought a Bucky Book this year and it's been fun trying out new restaurants.  We have more than gotten our value out of it.  However, what we've learned from it is so many restaurants are just overpriced for what they are!  It has made us appreciate Texas Roadhouse where we can get out of there for $20.  Granted, this during the M-Th early bird dinner specials and often times all I need for dinner is a bowl of chili.  Still, at 9 bucks for a 6 oz sirloin which satisfies Hubby, we can't go wrong.  Sometimes minor complaints about service, but that happens everywhere.  Texas Roadhouse will continue to be our weeknight eat-out treat."}
{"text":"The only thing good about Texas Roadhouse is the bread. The bread is amazing. I wish I could eat my weight in that. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger (I know it's a steakhouse, hence why I did give it 2 stars instead of 1). It came with no sauce. Literally just a beef patty, cheese, and lettuce. The meat was dry and the bread came out soggy because of the melted cheese that was on top. For some reason it took forever for our food to come out. It took almost an hour and we went for lunchtime so there wasn't that many people. Our server didn't really seem to care for us and it took forever to get our drinks refilled. I did hear from my group that the steaks were good, but other than that, their food kind of suck. Will definitely be here for steaks (nothing else)."}
{"text":"First off let me say that I hope this place remains a staple in this city but it doesn't have the old Texas Roadhouse feel to it anymore. Our visit was filled with loud, constant music to the point in which you couldn't hear yourself talk and weren't sure if family friends and wait staff could hear you well either. Roadhouses typically have a slight elevated ambiance in terms of volume normally but it was obnoxiously loud (very loud audible music, more so than normal/usual) during today's visit which may or may not have effected how well some of the food was prepared for tonight's order. They (waitress, etc) tried really hard to ensure that the service was good and that the food was good but it the experience, at least for me, didn't have the typical Texas Roadhouse feel to it. Too noisy and I truly think it may have possibly affected the preparation of some of the food that was ordered. I rated 4 stars but I truly felt it was more like a 3, 3.5 star experience/review."}
{"text":"Very little wait and it was a crowded Saturday night. Our waitress was wonderful, drinks were always filled.   The food was all amazing, steak was perfect,  the rolls and cinnamon butter was the best.   The environment was fun,  my kids loved when the staff danced."}
{"text":"We had Erica today and she's amazing. We had issues with food and drink, but she was on top.of fixing it right away and with a smile. She also made sure I didn't feel like a complainer, which is rare to find when you complain about getting diet instead of regular coke and the sending your steak back for being medium well instead of medium. I cannot say enough about her, she was one of the best waitresses I've ever had. Btw... turns out the coke was hooked up to the diet, she investigated that because we weren't the first to complain. The fact that she actually checked that without my suggesting it was also a rare thing. The steak that the cooked after sending the other one back was perfect.  If you come by, ask for Erica!"}
{"text":"Love the cinnamon butter and ribs.  Take-out service is always very good and the kids have a good time when the balloon man is there on kids night."}
{"text":"Great food great service. We had fresh food that was delicious and well made. The servers were attentive and kind. The atmosphere was fun and appealing. The only downside was management allowed bar area shenanigans to go a little too far."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with the chain. The portions are humongous, and they have the best yeast rolls I've ever had! I got two baskets of yeast rolls, and I almost didn't have enough room for the rest. Every time I come here, I bring almost half of the steak home for lunch the next day. The steaks are huge, but dry and overcooked sometimes.  The service is all right, and the atmosphere is fitting."}
{"text":"Your steaks need some help!  but as far as service Kristi/bartender and Joe/waiter you two  ROCK!  Thank you for being so friendly. :)"}
{"text":"Service is poor at best. Sat at the bar, had a couple of drinks and ordered a dinner to go. The dinner comes but it is not boxed and ready to go, bartender tells me he is getting me some warm bread and utensils, waited for over 13 minutes and decided it wasn't worth it, left the dinner sitting on the bar. Totally disgusted. Will totally remember next time when i leave over 25% as a tip,,,, wow what a waste of my money!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The customer service at this place is horrible. My wife and I just moved to Phoenix and we are huge fans of Texas Roadhouse, the moment we walked in one of the servers refused to serve us due to it being the end of her shift. That is very unprofessional, most of these people get paid by the hour and you cannot refuse service to someone just because your shift is almost over. I work in fast food and although I am ready to go home an hour before my shift, if a customer walks in a minute before I close the door I have to serve them. If you want control of your own schedule, become your own boss."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get a steak. It's always great. If you haven't tried their honey cinnamon rolls, you should."}
{"text":"This location has gotten much better lately. They have the best balloon guy here. He does great balloon- items. Kids got a motorcycle and a helicopter today. The service has gotten much better. They are actually starting to remember to bring silverware instead of making the customers ask for it. The only thing that is better at other locations is that the rolls are usually overdone at this location, which is why I only gave 4 stars. Keep up the good work, Gilbert and Germann location. Just take the bread out a bit earlier so it doesn't overcook and this location would be a 5-star location"}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse. I know it's a chain, but it's just so fun and the food is always plentiful and delicious.  I always have to start off with fried pickle chips; they are tangy and the batter is light enough to not be overpowering. I usually substitute the homemade ranch dressing in place of the blossom sauce, which is also good, but I think it's too much flavor for the small pickle chips.  My SO got a half rack of ribs with a Caesar salad and a loaded baked potato. By the time the food came out, he was almost stuffed from the rolls and salad! The Caesar salad is definitely his favorite. He isn't a huge fan of dryer ribs, he likes them to be coated and sticky in BBQ sauce, but these fall off the bone unlike some other dry ribs which can be tough. Also, he gets a side of the BBQ sauce to dip the ribs in.   I got a combo of chicken fingers and a half rack of ribs, with a side house salad and a cup of chili, and I too was almost full by the time the meal came out. The house salad is always delicious and very cold with chopped iceberg lettuce, diced tomatoes, diced eggs, shredded cheddar cheese, chopped bacon, and some homemade croutons on top. The house ranch dressing is so incredibly good and I cannot help myself to just pour the whole cup on top right when it comes out, even if I don't need it all. :D  The chili was absolutely underwhelming and quite gross. It looked and smelled good, and was topped with shredded cheese and onions, but it tasted a week old and out of a can. I took one bite and pushed it far away from me and quickly asked the waiter to take it. I double checked the menu and it does say they make it homemade, but it does not taste like it is. It tasted like Hormel canned chili and I will not ever get it again! Yuck.   The chicken fingers were very unique- they were definitely hand breaded and fried; the batter was soft and not crunchy at all, but they were very good in a home style way. They would be really good dipped in gravy. Again the ribs are the dry smoked kind but they fall off the bone and I like to drizzle a bit of steak sauce on top.    There is absolutely never a time when you can get dessert, just face it. The good thing is I am not a dessert person, so that doesn't affect me. However, you need to be very hungry and in some type of expandable waistband pants to even set foot in here. Haha I'm not kidding! It is an awesome choice for a birthday, a date night, or a night out with friends! Also, a side note, a manager almost always stops by to make sure your meal was to your liking, a nice touch. Check it out, you won't be disappointed! If you are, I give you permission to come find me and yell at me for recommending it. :)"}
{"text":"A great place to eat , the food is always cooked to perfection.  The service is great too.  Just one small problem that I have encountered was the butter they make had a long blonde hair in it.  Hey Texas Roadhouse please make your employees wear a hair net  Thank you"}
{"text":"Damn good food here. Some of the best ribs, steak and shrimp I've had. Great job! I can come here every weekend if I lived near by."}
{"text":"It was ok. Chicken was moist and flavorful and the steak was better than I thought it was going to be. Green bean side dish was quite oily, probably from the bacon. Ribs were salty, baked potato was good. Service was good. All in all it was a basic mass production theme resturaunt steakhouse. You can definatly do worse and you can do better. For the price it was better than expected."}
{"text":"Meh...just meh.  This is an Outback Steakhouse type of place.  Franchise steakhouses are pretty consistent and this one is the same.  It seems this place is strangely VERY popular.  The girlfriend and I arrived at 8:30pm on Friday to find the place with a 20 minute wait still.  This is Matthews, NC folks....that's just nutty.  Anyway, after a short wait we sat and I had the NY strip and she had the Dallas Filet.  I found my steak to be cooked to order (medium) and full of juicy goodness.  The Dallas Filet on the other hand left my better half a little disgruntled.  Apparently it was fatty which shouldn't happen on a Filet.  On top of that she wasn't a fan of the green beans that had a infusion of bacon in them.  Me, I'll take bacon in any form.    All in all the service was good, the food was average and I'd probably go back but it might be quite a while."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere at the Roadhouse. The food is just ok though. I usually cut my own fillets off of a full tenderloin, so I have high expectations. Flavoring is good, but tenderness of the meat is just fair. The staff is very nice and supports their tables very well. Not bad overall."}
{"text":"STEAK WAS AMAZING!!! Actuslly every bite was amazing. MEGAHN was the sweetest server ever!! Would have got a 5 star but the add on charges on my bill were not correct. I asked to have it fixed and they did not fix it.. Very strange .. I actually asked 3 times !!  Weird"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal from Texas Roadhouse. Delicious food and always friendly! Everyone is always pleasant, and the service is quick. Always a good \"go-to\" restaurant!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. The food is okay but the service is great and the restaurant is always packed. No complaints -- I'm sure my wife and I will be back!"}
{"text":"So we usually don't go to steak places because my husband is a vegetarian, but I found out kids eat for $.99 on Tuesdays.   So I thought it was a good night for steak.  I had the sirloin  with awesome sweet potato and corn. Excellent and I have  lunch for tomorrow.  The rolls with butter were too good- I had 3.  Kids ate a hotdog and chicken nuggets , steak fries, a free sundaes with a put your own toppings bar. They also had face painting and an armadillo  in costume."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have had just about everything on the menu from the fish, to prime rib, to roadkill. Always delicious. The rolls and green beans are amazing and u can usually get a free appetizer. Prices good too"}
{"text":"Went here with my mom and brother the first night we moved my mom to AZ. The wait was crazy. We got inside and was told that there was about an hour wait. Well we wanted some steak and took about 30 mins driving around trying to find the place since my GPS kept taking me everywhere but here. Anyways, we proceeded to the bar which had 2 open seats, so the three of us grabbed them. Ordered some drinks and waited for our name to be called. The bartenders were very friendly and told us that there was full service at the bar, but we opted to wait for a table.  The atmosphere is just like a Texas roadhouse, or kind of like Lone Star. They serve peanuts, and encourage you to toss the shells onto the floor.   So after about a 35min wait, we were seated. I ordered the prime rib medium rare as usual with a side ceaser salad and mashed potatoes. Mom had the fillet, and brother had a rib eye/ chicken breast combo. We ordered some fried pickles for an appetizer. The fried pickles were good, just couldn't eat much because they were very greasy. All the food was really good, my brother wished he had only gotten steak. The chicken was good he said, but liked his steak a lot better. The night we went, seemed like it was everyones birthday. Every five mins, they were moving their saddle and having the birthday girl/boy sit on it while everyone sings to them.   I would definitely come back here again when I go back out to AZ."}
{"text":"Ok... this place isn't where you want to take your date for a romantic dinner. It's loud, it's busy, it's very kid-friendly, and the floor is littered with peanut shells.    Our server was incredible and that tends to set the tone for me. She was quick with our refills and kept the bread and cinnamon butter coming.    I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my husband ordered ribs. We also ordered the Cactus Blossom appetizer.     My steak was cooked to perfection and I felt that aside from the lack luster side dishes, it was worth the money. My husband's ribs were good, but on the dry side. The appetizer was delicious! The apple pie we ordered for dessert was ok. It came with this weird caramel topping stuff that had the consistency of mucus. Not very appetizing.     I didn't show up expecting a Ruth's Chris experience. But I was happy with the place as a whole. I probably wouldn't go again on a weekend, but I could see coming here again with my family."}
{"text":"This is our favorite date night place for some great BBQ. We have never had a negative experience at any locations which we have gone to, however this location was different. We arrived around 8:45, with an hour and 15 until closing, we were not welcomed and they seemed short staffed. Following this we were notified after asking, that there is no bread as something was broken. Everyone around us was upset and the management handled the situation non professionally with no hospitality. Our waitress was so anything but accommodating. I'm very disappointed by this experience and I would recommend a different location."}
{"text":"Way to loud. 12 of us crammed into a back corner. My husband and I ordered country fried sirloin. Total mystery meat. Gravy tasted like flour. Neither of us could eat it. Caesar salad dressing was flavorless. Baked potato had chunks of sea salt rubbed on the skin which transferred to the potato and we don't eat salt so couldn't eat that. First time we've been to a Texas Roadhouse and it will be the last"}
{"text":"The wife and I have been here four times so far every time we had attentive staff superlative service and everything is always been cooked perfectly appetizers always show up first and everything seems to work perfectly the flavored tea is always perfect the meat is perfectly cooked the only thing I would have to say is their chili is weak  for a chili head it has a slight zing"}
{"text":"Our food was fantastic!  The fried pickles were awesome.  We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"The best kept secret in Bridgeville! I was hungry and decided to eat here before the Beyonce concert. Maybe I take TX Roadhouse for granted being from Texas, but this place reminds me of home! They also have $2, 18 oz Margaritas (frozen or on the rocks) on Tuesdays! You can get an extra shot of tequila for ~2 bucks! And we are talking the big drinks! I just came from Miami and these size margaritas were $25. Come here at least for that!   Kids night is Sundays and Mondays, 99 cent kids meals (amazing deal)! If you're a family of 4 eating before 6 pm with 2 kids meals, your meal could literally be 25 bucks! Friday night also has $5 long islands. I'll be back for that.  I sat at the bar for an early lunch/late dinner, and met an awesome bartender by the name of Mercedes. She was Super sweet and extra attentive to everyone!  I ordered the 6 oz sirloin, medium rare with a sweet potato loaded and chilis I also got a side of bread and that sweet cinnamon butter. My meal was $12.82 with a margarita. Hello!?!?? No mistake here. I'm excited about this! I will DEFINITELY be back, much sooner than later.   This place is so ridiculously priced it's CRAZY! Perfect for anyone on a budget. And the food is good! I'm in love!!!"}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to go seeing an average of 3 1/2 stars on Yelp, but we had been to another Texas Roadhouse years ago. We were a party of 9 and everyone loved their meals. The best part of our experience was certainly our waitress, Donnicka. Seriously the best service I've ever had. She was friendly, sharp, courteous and attentive.  I'd go back in a heart beat. Thank you Donnicka"}
{"text":"Good food for the price, aways great service. The prime rib is always delicious, service is great, get there early, normally a wait, the atmosphere is fun, I'd recommend to anyone that doesn't want to pay 30-40 for a piece of prime rib, the medium piece is just right, got the large cut and it had lots of fat, probably came off of a large end."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar as usual and received great service as usual along with consistently excellent food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I hadn't visited Texas Roadhouse in several years and it will be many more before or if we return. I ordered the trio tenderloins cooked medium. All three came cooked differently ranging from rare to medium well. The peppercorn seasoning ordered was non existent. The Long Island Tea tasted like liquid hairspray and was refused without substitution. We were never offered peanuts."}
{"text":"Everything was good. Brought the family. Wife, 5yo, and 1yo. Biscuits were hot and good and came with honey butter. Beer served in a frosty mug. Potato skins were good. Caesar salad was good. I ordered the 8oz filet with side of corn. Cooked med rare like I ordered. Not the very best filet I've had, but it was good (especially for the money) only $20!! Horseradish sauce was good with it. Wife ordered country fried chicken. Wished they had regular fried chicken. 5 yo had hotdog.   Server was friendly and quick. Nice, country atmosphere."}
{"text":"I haven't tried their food yet, but this place is definitely worth more than 3 and half. Their server is so thoughtful. So I don't even have to try their food. 5 starssssssssss all the way!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was horrible. The hostess was nice and seated us quickly. The waiter seemed lost and confused. I don't know if wait staff was under staff or what. They were horrible. Got our food order wrong. Do not go here unless it's a slow time or better yet not at all. I would never return. Our servers name was Charlie."}
{"text":"Love the rolls and the salmon. Such a fun atmosphere. Every waiter/waitress I've had at this restaurant has gone above and beyond my expectations. They are always so polite and seem excited to work there."}
{"text":"Consistency is key and will keep good customers always!!! We have been to many Texas Roadhouse locations and never had any issues with food and or service.   My fiance and I came in 2 years ago and met the most efficient server Amber. The second time we were fortunate to have her again. This time our steak wasnt cooked to perfection but I didnt want to complain. She took care of it with a smile on her face and has been the same empathetic and caring server since.   Now when we come we only sit in her section and she always remembers us! She  is also always excited when she sees us!! We really enjoy spending our few and far in between date nights here at Texas Roadhouse with Amber!! Thank you all for the great treatment."}
{"text":"I'd rather go to Zaxbys or outback.  The salmon was just average. The rattle snake bites tasted like breading with a sliver jalapeños .   Plus they came out after we had our food."}
{"text":"we ate here on 8/1/14 around 1:00 pm.  there was no wait and our party of 3 adults and 2 kids were seated immediately.  the free rolls and honey butter were good.  our boys loved it.  we ordered roasted bbq chicken, 10 oz ribeye with ribs, kids mini cheeseburgers, and all american cheeseburger.  all the entrees were good.  not the best obviously but good.  our server was trying very hard to be funny but all we wanted was just great service.  all in all we had a good experience.  our meal was approximately $59 before tip."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place. It's in a shopping center closest to the highway. It's an experience I never had moving from Chicago. The restraint is large. Came in on a Thursday night and was soon seated. They offered that I pick out my steak from the window if I wanted one. Upon being seated there was a large bucket of peanuts. They also brought fresh bread that had a brown sugar mix with it. The server was nice she really took her time to explain things to me and even brought out mini samples for me to try the sides to see what I wanted! I loved this. I got the hurricane which was light and fruity. It was recommended. For dinner I had the barbecue chicken with mash potatoes and veggies. I like that the veggies were steamed and didn't come with any seasoning I could do it myself. The mash potatoes were made fresh. The staff went above and beyond to ensure we were accommodated. Didn't get a photo of the main course by the time the food came out I totally forgot and ate it up. I was hungry. The place was clean and I will probably return. I recommend."}
{"text":"Good food and service.....just another chain restaurant...."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place out for months. Service was great and the atmosphere was nice. However, the food was well below average. Had Sirloin Steak and Ribs with sweet potato. Steak was bad, ribs were too charred and the potato was soaked in butter with too much brown sugar. Not likely to go back."}
{"text":"Sooo good! I love their bread! Love the butter. Prime steak and bone in ribeye, perfect! With fresh veggie and sweet potato. Freshly baked sweet potato, wonderful! Strawberry cheese cake, very good too! We have 6 people, everybody enjoyed their food"}
{"text":"Definitely a big fan of Texas Roadhouse.  I've been to this location multiple times. Its in a great area. Its close to the nearby Harkins...so its fantastic to catch Dinner and a Movie.   Let's be honest, who doesn't come here for their rolls. If you don't, you are lying to yourself. They have a decent size menu, so you can always mix it up without being bored on your next visit.  Customer service has always been really great. While were here, I'd honestly like to give a HUGE shout out to the waiters, cooks, and managers etc...here. They put up with so many annoying customers and somehow keep a smile on their face. Have you seen how many people are in this restaurant around 6-7pm? Its amazing how they keep their composure to make you happy.  The wait time is long unless you get there closer to 5 or after 8:30ish. Thats obviously for good reason though. People love place.   I think the ONLY thing I could communicate to management is to somehow put heaters our on the patio, or the waiting area for us Arizonians. We get cold outside and don't know how to handle 60 degree weather LOL.   I'll definitely be back to try and make this a 5 star review.  Food 5/5 Customer service 5/5 Value 4/5 Restaurant cleanliness 4/5"}
{"text":"Not very good. Started off wrong with the snotty little brat at the reception desk snipping at me that it would be at least 20-30 minutes for a table when I checked in.  I never asked for shortcuts or tried to slip by her so I'm not sure why she had to talk to me like I was asking for a free meal.  30 minutes later we did get seated. Waitress was nice and great sense of humor. Food on the other hand was not very good.  Prime rib was dry, baked potato was cold. Half the filet was great, half was chewy and not so great. Filet medallions sat under the heat lamp just a bit too long which really toughened them up. Sides all looked like they were out too long and average tasting.  I spent over $200 and did not feel very good about it. If it's great food , no worries, when it's not like tonight, left with a wasted my money feeling."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I always order my steaks MR. And every time it always comes well done. Bummer. But what makes me give them 5 stars is how well they take care of the situation. I always get my server at my table as soon as the food hits the table. Just enough time for me to cut in the steak and see I need a recoook. I'm very thankful they take quick care of the situation. And I eventually get the right temp. They are very friendly!!"}
{"text":"Since it was my first time stepping foot into any sort of steakhouse, I did not know what to expect when I first walked into the Texas Roadhouse located in Mesa, Arizona. I could automatically tell it had a very Western theme to it from the wooden interior from the chairs to the tables, the animal heads placed on the walls and just the overall items scattered throughout the restaurant. Also, there were peanut shells dispersed all throughout the floor which gave it an even more Western feel. Right when you walk in, there was a big basket of peanuts that you could eat while you were waiting to be seated. Since it was a Sunday night, it was fairly busy and there was a 20-minute wait but that was expected.   Before going to Texas Roadhouse, I was told about how good the bread was that they bring out to you when you first sit down. I definitely was not disappointed, as it was basket of warm, delicious rolls paired with an amazing cinnamon butter. At that moment, I knew it was worth coming to this restaurant. For my main meal, I decided to go with the California grilled chicken. It was a marinated chicken breast with jack cheese, fresh-sliced avocado, pico de gallo and a honey lime sauce which also came with two sides, and I chose the mashed potatoes and rice. The tender chicken paired with the sauce and avocado was a perfect combination and it was delicious. While my only complaint would have to be that there was too much gravy on the mashed potatoes, it was an easy fix as all I had to do was pour some of it off but that definitely did not take away from my meal. The rice was also perfectly cooked and had the perfect amount of seasoning. Going into this meal starving, I was very satisfied once I finished as it was just the right amount of food. It also only cost $10.99 which is a reasonable price for the amount of food that was on the plate. My friend that I was with decided to go with the grilled chicken salad which is priced at $10.49 which is also reasonable for the amount that she got.    The service was good at this location as all the employees seemed on top of things as our server always came by to ask if we needed anything and to fill up our waters when they got low. I could tell that they enjoyed their jobs as they were always smiling and dancing. Overall, I was very happy with my first experience at a Texas Roadhouse. The atmosphere was nothing like I was used to being in and the food was amazing and at a good price. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to a friend and I will be back soon to try even more items on the menu. I also signed up to receive emails from the restaurant, and by doing that I received a free appetizer so it will be worth it to go back."}
{"text":"We have never had a bad steak here.  They are consistently good.  The salads are fantastic.  The ribs are fall of the bone tender every single time.    Love it."}
{"text":"Awesome value , great food and they put out great coupons. Their ribeyes are great !  Great bread as well ! Staff is always happy to help you. Busy?? Sit at the bar and enjoy dinner ..... Their earlybird dinner specials are great but beware of snowbird season (nov- april) This is a very popular location and there will be a wait."}
{"text":"Great steaks. Friendly staff. Good prices. Large portions.  Better call ahead 1/2 hour before arriving. They don't take reservations but put your name down. Always enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Chelsea is a great waitress. She quick, friendly, able to multitask, and good at her job on a busy night. Ask for Chelsea. The 20 oz ribeye was amazing as always."}
{"text":"I haven't had Texas Roadhouse in probably 4 years. I noticed that they had them here in Arizona and took my girlfriend there who has never been. The wait was long but it's well worth it, the food and customer service is unbeatable. My girlfriends steak was a little bit undercooked and so was mine. I'm a man and I'll eat red meat raw so I had no complaints. She told the waitress and the waitress very kindly took it to the back to get it cooked more. The manager came to our table with the steak and apologized and took her steak off the bill. Her steak looked perfect after they cooked it a bit longer and the manager was very professional. We will be back frequently."}
{"text":"Love this place the food is awesome chose when you come wisely because this place is always packed service is always good I'm glad I live close to this restaurant"}
{"text":"The food is great. However, the noise level in this restaurant is very loud. I am not sure why, but every time I go, I can barely hear the people I'm eating with. This is an issue for me. Be prepared to wait if you go because this place is crowded all the time!"}
{"text":"This was an above average restaurant experience, but not great. I recently ate at Longhorn Steakhouse and everything there was just better. Longhorn Steakhouse steak was better, the bread was better, the service was better. However, Texas Roadhouse was still a good meal."}
{"text":"Love this place! Manny the bartender is excellent and we love his dry sense of humor. We appreciate that they are very military friendly and offer free meal to Veterans on Veterans Day. Best steakhouse in Surprise, hands down!"}
{"text":"We called ahead so we didn't have to wait, we didn't get the constant asking about our food or anything like that.  In fact we didn't see our server very often at all.   We waited a long time for food, drinks, and refills. I asked about 5-6 times for some bread before he brought any.   Food was only okay.  I ordered pulled pork dinner and it was tasty, but kinda dry, wife and son said same thing about the ribs, very dry, my wife had to ask for more BBQ sauce.  Oldest son had cheeseburger, and he seemed satisfied, but youngest son ad sliders and took one bite and wouldn't eat them saying they were nasty. He's 4, so take that as you will.   It was my middle sons birthday, we let the server know and they brought out a saddle and Sunday and announced it was his birthday and for everyone to give a bid loud yeee haaw.   Overall it wasn't a horrible experience, our server seemed nice, but very busy.    It won't be my first choice of place to eat again, but I may consider eating there again some day."}
{"text":"We Visit this Location Today 5/14/2018 After Our first Visit around 2012 we decided to give it a try because The First Time that we went there was terrible.  Today everything was going well untill my Wife found a Fly in Her Ice Tea. We call the Server : Sandi and pointed to Her the Disgusting fly.  .She Gave us the Excuse That Was this Time in The Year when Fly's are all over I ask Her immeditly  For the Manager.  After She brought us the Check the restaurant was still charging us For that Dirty and disgusting Drink . I again Ask Her For the Manager and She TOLD me that the MANAGER , ZACH L. was to busy to come and give us the attention that We demanded. I asked Her to Show Me where was the manager.   After several attempts she finally complied and when I approch the manager to demand a explanation about why was unable to come to our table to give him our Complain.  HE JUST TOLD ME WITH EXTREME ARROGANCE .YES it WAS A FLY I KNOW.   AT THAT MOMENT I TOLD HIM IN HIS FACE THAT I WILL CALL THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT And For Him was No difference . He apologized only After He Saw Me raise my Voice which at The End was the only Defense that I was able to Use in order to vent my Frustration. From that Point On I raise my Voice even louder to Advise all the Customer about the poor Health Conditions of this Restaurant . PLEASE KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN IN THAT PLACE , BETTER YET DON'T GO THERE . THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE WELL BEING OF THE CUSTOMERS . I DEFINITELY NEVER WILL VISIT THIS LOCATION EVER AND I WILL CONTACT ARIZONA HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND Texas Roadhouse Headquarters ."}
{"text":"Trenton was literally the best server we have ever had! He had diet cokes on the table before I was even half way done with my first one! He was so kind, and helpful!  The steak was a little overcooked, but everything else was great!"}
{"text":"Not sure if they are under new management or have new staff. I go to Texas once a month and the last couple months have been horrible. I was extremely disappointed not only with the quality but service as well. Me and my girlfriend always ordered medium ribeye and they brought out something beyond well done. I had to wait about 11 minutes until our server came back to ask how it was. I show her the steak and she said wow yea not medium at all sorry about that. They brought out new steaks. Which were thin and no joke rare. It's a steak house. How do you mess up the steak 2 times?! Beyond me. I didn't want to complain again so we just dealt with, not only was it under cooked it. The quality was horrible. I don't think I will be coming here again. Not sure what happened with this spot"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Steak places. My things that I like are the cactus blossom, fried pickles, rolls, prime rib, porterhouse T-bone, w/ sautéed mushrooms, onions, green beans, baked potato, and mashed potatoes....."}
{"text":"Food okay, wait staff okay.  Rolls were delish as always. I had the Chili before my meal and that was pretty good. For my main course I had a Steak (strip) and Sweet Potato. That was fine not great as ordered the Steak Med-Rare and it came Med-Well so that kind of ruined that for me.   Waitress was nice, talked about her kids and the recent snow day they just had from a blizzard that hit them not long before we visited. Can't remember her name but I would give her props if I could, sorry hun!!   Overall, Texas Roadhouse is Texas Roadhouse, its a chain and if its your kind of thing you will like it. Just not particularly my cup of tea, but good for a change up every once and a while.  Food was not bad and wait staff was friendly, if you just want something different but does not really stand out this could be a place to try.   Cheer folks!!!"}
{"text":"Typical steak house, to be fare my cousin wanted to have her husband's fiftieth birthday here. Being a veg head I figured I am not going to find much on the menu that I can eat, and I was right. I ended up with a giant sweet potato without butter, just brown sugar and a small salad. I still had a blast with all the family and of course teasing my cousin in law about his upcoming leap into the big 5-0 area of life.  Everyone's entries looked good, most of the kids had burgers and fries. Everyone who had steak said it was good. It reminded me of your typical Bonanza, less than stellar cuts of meat in a family (western) atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was recently at this location and I am not one to complain but I left regretting not speaking to a manager! My server was the absolute worst, came to take our drinks never came back to see if we would like refills, when she came back took out order left I believe it was her fault that the food was wrong and not the kitchens I ask both time for new bread and she said that they had none left if was a good hour and a half before close, the next time she came back she gave the check and took literally 2 minutes to come and take that! Horrible service!"}
{"text":"My family and I had always enjoyed eating at Texas Roadhouse so we were thrilled when it was being built near us. We have tried in numerous occasions to get into the establishment but the wait time is ridiculous. So, today we thought it was our lucky day cause we seated righted away. Typically when you're seated a server is there within minutes to help you, that was not the case we waited well over 15 minutes. And to make matters worse everyone else around us was being helped. Frustrated by the situation we got up and left! Everyone was saying have a great day oblivious of the fact that we'd NOT been helped. I did mention to the hostess my concerns and as we were leaving another dissatisfied customer mentioned he waited 45 minutes for his food to brought. No stars.. Simply disappointed. Thank you for old faithful Outback is right next door!"}
{"text":"Lunch was just OK.  I ordered my burger well done and it arrived with pink inside.  The burger was not seasoned very well.  My husband ordered a pulled pork sandwich and he didn't like it.  He tried to eat the meat but the sauce was over powering. His sandwich came with a huge unedible onion ring on it."}
{"text":"I love this place and eat here at least twice per month.  I have had most of the items on the menu.  Main dishes I can recommend:  pork chops, porterhouse steak, chicken critters, sirloin steak, pulled pork dinner.  The green beans are the best in town.  Also love the loaded sweet potato. The homemade yeast rolls are something you will crave.  The chili and macaroni and cheese are subpar and I would not recommend either of these items.   If you order a margarita make sure you add a \"kicker.\"  The 1800 is the best.  It can be loud at times especially when they turn up their music and do their western dance routine.  Very reasonably priced for high quality food."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is awesome. I hadn't been in years because none are close to me but we had a gift card so we went on Wed at 6pm and oh my gosh was it crowded. The wait was about 20 minutes, who would have thought for a Wed night! Anyways, our server Issiah was really good&all the food we got was delicious. Steaks, sides, the bread (to die for), and even the drinks were perfect. I forgot how much I liked this place."}
{"text":"I may be a little bias being a Texan, but this place is awesome. I've been to Morton's, Fleming's, Ruth's Chris etc. The steaks here are great at a fraction of the cost of others. Start off with rattlesnake bites, 16 oz Ft Worth ribeye, side salad, and broccoli. I almost forgot the rolls and cinnamon butter"}
{"text":"1st time here! Been in AZ for 3 years & I'm kicking myself in the ass for not going any sooner! Now I know why the parking lot is always packed! Great friendly service. Hot chicks with great smiles. The bread is ridiculously hot & fresh. The beers were supersonic cold. Ribeye was juicy pink & tastey. The mushrooms were explosive. Sweat corn was nothing like I've ever imagined. The mash potatoes with the works was intense. It was an orgy of food. I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Went with friends visiting from overseas and had a great time and the server was so amazing . Lots of people and can be busy but still very entertaining and the line dancing was enjoyed by our friends . We know this place from our properties in Texas so familiar with the food . Delicious food and all were happy . Recommended place to get lots to eat and taken care of .."}
{"text":"This was our first time going to Texas Roadhouse and we will definitely be back! All the service was awesome and the food came quickly. The steak was cooked to my specifications and was delicious! We are excited to be able to go again."}
{"text":"This is the one of the only steakhouse I have found that makes my steak rare....Everywhere else it is over cooked.   Staff is friendly and aalways aim to please. Yes it is loud but it's fun. If you are looking for a quiet romantic dinner this is not your place."}
{"text":"During my last visit.  I was looking for a good place for kind of dinner.      Never hear about that place. But my partner say let's try it.   We walk in. Saw all the fresh meet by the window there. It's look great.  We got our seat.  Then we order.    Service was fantastic.   The girl was so helpful.  Nice.  Friendly.   Then we got the food. Was fantastic.  Lots of food.  So fresh and good.  I loved it it so as my partner.    Heheheh next day.  We went for lunch.   We had to. The food was so good the night before.   So we went for a lunch this this. Was just amazing.     I should look for a place like that in ca.  It was a pleasant surprise for me.   Will Go there again very soon"}
{"text":"I had a great time here with my friend for dinner on Sunday, but a few things added up for me to knock off a star. Despite coming on a weekend at dinner time, we had zero wait time because there were just two of us and staff were quick to get seated. PS I LOVE how they automatically bring a bowl of bread and their amazing cinnamon sugar butter over to the table with you. Their bread is honestly the best part of the meal for me.  Our waitress was very accommodating when we asked for an extra minute and was upbeat and excited to talk to us the entire time. We ordered the fried pickles (delicious and a huge portion, great for splitting) which came with ranch and a cajun horseradish (surprisingly good) dipping sauces. We also ordered a full platter of ribs and a 10 oz. ft. worth ribeye steak, both to split.  Each comes with 2 sides, so I got the corn and steak fries and my friend got the caesar salad and steak fries.    The fried pickles came out first pretty quickly, and while we were munching on those, my friend's salad and my corn came, and shortly after that, our meat. The steak as absolutely delicious, slightly salty for my taste, but perfectly medium and very tender. I thought the flavor of the ribs were great, but they were slightly dry. I was super disappointed in the corn though because you could tell it came from a can.  The real disappointment came with the fries, which...never came. We had to ask our waitress for them when she mentioned bringing over the check. She was very gracious about it and apologized profusely, but I was still disappointed that they didn't come on time, and after the fact, that we didn't get any sort of compensation for it. It's hard to track down your waitress in the restaurant because they're handling many tables at once and it's like a maze in there, so we didn't think it was our fault that they forgot the order.  Regardless, we still had a great time and would definitely recommend this place if you're having a craving for some good old steak and potatoes. But seriously, the bread is amazing (better than Red Lobster in my opinion)"}
{"text":"My friends and I chose Texas Roadhouse for our dinner destination last night and I'm so glad we did.   Ethan was absolutely the best server I've ever had. He has quite the personality and kept our drinks full all night.   Food was good, service was GREAT."}
{"text":"If you anyone is ever in a mood to eat a good juicy flavorful steak and amazing ribs that just fall apart in your hands, I highly recommend eating at this restaurant Texas Roadhouse!  There service is on point and the the waiters are ver informative with their menu.  They don't rush and are always returning back to our table to check up on us.  We gave it four star for their delicious food and amazing service."}
{"text":"Great location. Call ahead seating was key! The place was packed but we were able to be seated quickly. The staff was friendly and the food came out fresh. Our rolls were refilled quickly and the portions were just right. The atmosphere was fun and exciting. I would absolutely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Why do I find myself impressed every time I come here? Perfectly cooked steaks today, as usual. Tried the shrimp for the first time here and it was just as good as the steak always is.  I don't even like margaritas but I like them here.  Best service I've had in a long time, I think his name was Herman. Like so good that even if the food wasn't good I'd come back."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is, and continues to be one my favorite places to get a good & affordable steak.  Ordered the ribeye and shrimp combo tonight and it was delicious as usual. My date and I had a great time, had amazing service as well. Like over the top great service.   Come here pretty regularly and always leave extremely satisfied and full"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN!!! OK, I place a to go order of two ribeyes was told to pick up at 6:15pm..... Once getting to the place, noticed the take out parking spots were all taken. I drove around the parking lot, trying to find a plkace to park. 15 minutes later I find one. I go to the \"TO GO\" entrance, where I am met by a young lady. She informs me my food is right here on the counter in front of me. Then the phone rings,and she decides to take another order instead of finishing mine. After 5 minutes she returns to me. I told her  about the parking situtation, and make the coment of being the only person in take out. She told me busy night. While leaving, I see a family come out get in their car, parked in take out, and drive away.As I am leaving I see another family pull in and go in. I called the store, and asked to speak with the manager. I explained what had happened, and how I felt. The young lady said hold on I will get the boss you need to tell him!!!!! I was then on the phone with a man name BURT, who is not only the boss, BUT THE OWNER!!!!! I told him about what I had just went through tring do take out from his store,how I was made to wait to even get my food.......WELL, GUESS WHAT THE OWNER BURT SAID?????? STEVE, thats the price you pay for a busy store, he isnt the police,so parking wasnt his problem.... The girl, well she is the only one over there and if the phone rings???????? It took me 45 minutes to get take out!!!!  THERE IS NO EXCUSE!!!!!!!! busy stores with bad customer service CLOSE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here with my wife for lunch. It wasn't crowded too bad. Granted it was lunch time on Sunday. The service was very good. Our waiter, Josh, was very attentive.  He was really on top of it.   The Rib appetizer was real good. Falling off the bone tender. They had a good flavor too. I had the Rib eye steak & grilled shrimp. They were cooked to perfection.  When they brought our steaks to us, she asked us if we needed any steak sauce. I told her if I needed A-1 or 57 sauce, then it wasn't cooked right. Everything was excellent.  Being that it is my birthday, they gave me the rib appetizer for free.  Overall experience. .... real good."}
{"text":"I don't know what exactly it is about the food here, but I always wind up going home with the worst upset stomach of my life. I've given it several tries, varying what I ate (so much that I didn't eat ANY of the same things during visits... not even the bread/cinnamon butter that they hand up upon arriving). So, that's why I can't rate this place very well.   Otherwise, service is always good and no other complaints"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat been coming here for a while and glad to say the quality of the food is still great"}
{"text":"I ordered to go from here a few days ago and was so happy I did! I got the Road Kill (chopped steak) with extra mushrooms and it was so delicious. I am pretty sure I could make an entire meal off of just the mushrooms, they were unreal good. The rolls are always warm and fluffy. This is my new go to place!"}
{"text":"This themed resturant serves mainly steak but does really well with other species too. I ordered a medium rare 12oz Ribeye last time I was there. The server asked me to check doneness before leaving and will replace your steak if it's not done right (the table next to mine had that problem). The side steamed vegetables were cooked just so it's still crunchy and fresh. The side green bean was a little disappointing because it was too salty.  But with a name like Texas Roadhouse, most would think that their best dishes are of the cow persuasion. However, I beg to differ. They have the most delightful (barring Chik-fi-let) chicken fingers, named Chicken Critters, I've had anywhere. It's fried with a delicious batter and served with your dipping sauce of choice. Their default dipping sauce is honey mustard but you should order it with breakfast gravy (white) for a true Southern (Southwest) taste. There weren't too much peanut shells on the floor as the other TR I've been to in the South but I tell you what, the food tastes the same. So if you're lookin' for a grand ole time eatin' and listenin' to country music. Give this joint a try."}
{"text":"Great service. Had a bad experience at another TRH and they honored the free coupon I received from the other one. No mistakes and steak was cooked perfect.  We also got free entertainment of line dancing.  Thanks from my family."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio which has a mega blaster misting system (see pics).  It was a little aggressive and got us wet.  LOL  Good food, good selection, good service."}
{"text":"We were hungry for a good ol' steak and baked potato, and as usual we were not disappointed.  Food came when it should (steak came after our salads were done),it was hot, delicious served with a smile. JUSTINE was our server and was fun to watch.....she never once let that smile go away even tho she was plenty busy.  Besides some 2 tops she also waited on 2 tables of 6!  I gave up counting how many baskets of rolls she delivered and how many drinks she refilled...always with that smile and gracious attitude. Only downer was when a runner brought our food I asked for more butter and she replied that she wasn't our server and that Justine would have to get that for me!  J happened to be right behind us and  took care of it!"}
{"text":"I guess the word is surprised, it was surprisingly good. It's just after 6 and we were invited out for steak dinner. The question was where to go with quite a number of choices here in the area. We talked about Bobby-Qs, Black Angus and Texas Roadhouse. None of us had tried here at the Texas Roadhouse  so we poked our heads in and there was a wait but not very long. They handed us a pager, we waited about 15 minutes and we were seated. You never really know when a place is working at capacity if things are going to go well, but as I have already hinted... no problemo!  The waitress introduced herself on the way to the table, while grabbing some rolls and honey butter. Sat us down in a booth got our drink order and offered us appetizers that she said would be out in a flash if we wanted one. We picked the onion blossom, it was a good choice crisp and tasty with a pair of dips for flavor, one was I believe a chipolte remoulade and the other their ranch dressing, both were good the chipolte was a little on the spicy side.  The atmosphere was noisy but we were able to talk as well as hear each other. The music is in keeping with the name, country western. While we were working on the onion blossom all of the sudden all the employees are lined up in the aisle clapping, I was expecting them to break out in a round of Happy Birthday but no... They line danced through the song... That was a new one on me. The staff in matching T-shirts that say \"I love my Job\" was dancing and singing to the music. Some were beginners, some much more proficient it was a hoot to watch. And like it started when the song was over everyone was back to work.  The order for our main course was taken, The 20 oz porterhouse for me, Jo had the steak salad, with William rounding out the order with a grilled chicken. Each plate came with 2 side dishes from a long list. I had a salad with blue cheese dressing, and the home fries. I will mention that William picked one that he didn't care for the green beans, when he mentioned it to the waitress, she offered to switch it without hesitation, The drinks were renewed before anyone could  get to the bottom of their glass and the steaks were amazing. This was 5 star.  Opps, I gave them 4 pretty much for the noise and the loud music, and we will go back I am sure. This is a fun place, and the prices are not out of line, a Texas down home kind of feel to the place will welcome you back, we are looking forward to it."}
{"text":"It was good! There on a weeknight around 8:30p for a celebration dinner. Super busy for a weeknight. They still worked really fast and did their best. My blossom was hot but my mashed potatoes were not. Steak was great as usual. Server seemed a little stressed out and took a while for drinks/bread, but he was so busy that I couldn't be mad about it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. I've had steak,  shrimp, salmon, and salads here everything I've ever ordered is fantastic. The service is always outstanding. Their rolls are addicting and keep on coming throughout the meal.  I've always left highly satisfied and with a doggie bag."}
{"text":"I've gone to this location a dozen times and only twice had great service. The two most recent times were bad enough that from now on I will be going to the Arrowhead location."}
{"text":"We had some beers which are always good here for their 6 or so choices on tap. The bartender offered to let us taste some beers we were unfamiliar  We had the grilled chicken salad. The grilled chicken was especially good, the rest of the salad was very  fresh but standard. There warm rolls are always great.  They often lack good seating for parties of 5 or more."}
{"text":"I held a birthday party here for my wife and invited 10 of our close friends and relatives. The staff was very accommodating, early in the day I called ahead, and they were able to have two table ready for us on our arrival. I had also dropped the cake off early as not to ruin he surprise. Our servers were quick and very attentive, as our friends filtered in, our servers were there with rolls, drinks and quickly put in the order for our two Cactus Blossoms. The chaos and mistakes were made with the entrees as five of us ordered sirloins. Granted, three were of different sizes and cook temperatures. When the steaks arrived, they were mixed up and there was little organization from the food runner. I sent mine back, another steak returned at the wrong cook temperature, our server offered to take it back. Third time's a charm as it came back to my expectations. I didn't say anything or ask for the manager as I was more focused on my wife's birthday. The manager ended up coming the steak. Service was good, food was good, but the kitchen expo could use a little more work especially with large parties.  I bring my family here every few months and really do like the restaurant and the food, I'm hoping it was a bad night and that future experiences will be much better."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the worst meals we have ever had. Husband and I ordered the 8oz filets, medium well and my daughter had french fries. Fries were still partially frozen and steaks were bloody and almost purple inside. Sent my steal back and got a burnt sirloin in return. Waitress couldn't keep sweet tea vs regular tea straight and still charged us for root beer. We didn't pay for our steaks but it was a nightmare and we all left hungry. After husband and kids went outside the manager offered to cook us more food to take home which I refused since we were all out of time and patience. Service was extremely slow!  Will not be returning. Their \"service manager\" desperately needs training. Oh, and Lexi at the front desk was very very rude!  Corporate would do well to send in some help here!  Wish I could post a pic of the horrible food. :("}
{"text":"We ate at the one In Charlotte last night and many others. Tonight's meal and serviced sucked, four of us all had horrible meals! The service was equally bad we had to ask for silverware twice while we had out meals and the ribs were so dry we could not finish them and the steaks were over cooked and burnt and asked for a redo and then way undercooked ! The server knew we were not happy but could care less"}
{"text":"Always good service and the food is consistently good.  Chicken fried chicken is great! Thank you for saving us from Logan's across the street."}
{"text":"First time at this location for a family dinner.  The margaritas and beers are excellent! I ordered the 6oz sirloin and it was just ok.  It did not pop with flavor nor was a juicy as I had with pas experiences from other Texas Roadhouse locations.  My husband ordered the chicken fried steak, said it was just ok.  The service was a little slow to start but she picked up the pace once we finally got to order.  We will be back."}
{"text":"We went on Father's Day ... it was a huge crowd but we managed to get a table for 5 in 30 minutes. The service was great and everyone enjoyed their meal. Food was fresh and waitress was wonderful!! My favorite place to eat when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Where you are first greeted there is a  open glass fresh steak display showing off all there cuts of steaks. You can enjoy there unlimited peanuts in a tin bucket at your table and encouraged to toss the shells on the floor! Wide selection of steaks,chicken and burgers. Good selection of meal size salads as well. The bar has  big Tv's for sports fanatics and country music plays on the overhead speakers that adds to the ambience not take away from it. The service is fast and attentive. Smother your steak in mushroom and butter mmm-mmm-mmm!"}
{"text":"Best steak ever! Service was awesome! Wish there was one in the west side burbs...solo good!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. First time was great and was really busy but still had great service. This second time the kitchen messed up my order. Didn't freak out because it wasn't our server's fault. The manager came out and apologized for the mishap and said she would check on it. After the rest of the table got their porter house steaks, ribeyes & ribs I was still waiting on my filet. The manager came by again when everyone else was finished and I told them I still hadn't been served my steak. She said she was sorry and she'd take it off the bill and get it out right away. I ate solo but when it was time for the check the manager apologized again and comped the whole meal! I was shocked because I thought it woukd just be the filet combo. We made sure to thank them and tipped the server well because again it was not his fault the kitchen messed up. They went above and beyond to make sure our experience wasn't ruined. Will be back and happy to get another large steak!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with a friend who is an absolute fan of this place!   Texas Roadhouse is a fun eatery to go to with your friends if you're looking for a nice, casual dining experience. They offer a variety of very hearty, American-style foods. They are known for their steaks and their baby back ribs. I had the ribs and they were delicious!  When I came here, we had a super friendly male server. He was very attentive and made our dining experience a great one!"}
{"text":"love this place. friendly staff. great food...there were 9 of us and everybody was very satified. we need an location in OC, Ca"}
{"text":"I love Texas Roadhouse, and this location was just as great as my favorite ones in Louisiana. My fiance had pulled pork and I had grilled salmon. We both enjoyed our meals. The salmon is never fishy tasting, always prepared the way I ask and one of my favorite dishes. I like the steamed vegetables and steak fries with honey mustard as my sides. The service was perfect too. Our waiter brought us extra bread and lots of refills on drinks. We had plenty of food left over for lunch the next day and we only spent about $30 before the tip."}
{"text":"I rate this place so high because of the food. I would challenge anyone to find a better Ribeye for the price in the Champaign-Urbana area.  I would give it a 2-3 star in every other facet: Atmosphere, Service, and management. The atmosphere is a little stiff and the service is decent, but in my opinion, the food makes up for it all.  Great job to the cooks back there."}
{"text":"It's a chain restaurant... So really my expectations are very different then with a more local based restaurant.  The all-you-can-eat free peanuts is a good idea... Keeps people thirsty and ordering lots of drinks me because of the salt on the peanuts :-)  The bread rolls pretty good... The food in general is really basic. It's not outstanding but it's not bad.  I ordered the baby back ribs... But my first order of the rims they came out overcooked and one and was actually burnt. So I don't know who was working the pass had lunch... But someone dropped the ball on quality control.  The manager was really nice and promptly responded to the issue... She got me a new order of ribs out relatively quickly... And she also took my meal off the check which was nice.  This waitstaff stopping in the middle of service and doing the little dances... Is old. It just doesn't do anything for me. And actually is distracting. Because sometimes you don't get things as quickly as you want or the servers are not as attentive because they're busy dancing.  So if you're just looking for a decent steakhouse... With free peanuts and bread... This is a place for you. The food is good for this kind of chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Better than Longhorn. Food is made as ordered. Really good cinnamon butter with rolls. Atmosphere is ok, could do without the twangy music but the dining area is loud enough to make it hard to hear. Servers Frank & Elizabeth were attentive without being overbearing or annoying."}
{"text":"Food was cold. Mashed potatoes were cold and had huge Idaho potatoe skins in them. They were cold and I had to send them back, then my husband's corn was cold. My child's chicken strips came out without the fries. Told the manager who replaced the potatoes and corn but seemed over worked and tired didn't really seem to care too much.  They need to bring Reba and Burt back. Place is going down hill."}
{"text":"4 words.  rib eye medium rare. and cinammon butter rolls. hands down, the BEST steakhouse.  better than outback, ruth chris's, all the fancy places."}
{"text":"I was a little worried when i read some of these reviews but i had a great experience on a friday night. We had to wait about 20 minutes but once we were seated everything went smoothly. Our waitress was wonderful, promptly asked us what drinks we wanted and returned soon after. We asked for more time to order and she returned in just enough time. Our salads and entrees came out quickly. I was worried about the food not being cooked properly because of the reviews but our steak and prime rib came out great. We had refills without having to ask. Our waitress came to check on us after the food came out to make sure everything was ok and checked in on us again shortly after to see if we needed anything else. The manager also came by to ask how everything went. All around me i saw young kids hustling to keep the flow of the restaurant going. They were all working so hard. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"We get the Roadkill and share it.  It is ground sirloin with onions, really delish and you can get it cooked the way you like it!"}
{"text":"Best place in town...my family's favorite. From the peanut shells on the floor to the country music blaring, we love it. And don't forget the yummy fresh bread, bowl full of peanuts and great looking waiters! If you want good food for an affordable price, you can't go wrong at Texas, unless of course you're allergic to nuts. Then, I'm sorry my friend, you're just pure out of luck."}
{"text":"No question what I get when we go here. Steak. And sometimes accompanied with ribs. Great value for the price, as I always take enough home for a second meal. Service has never been anything less than good and quick. Occasionally, they try and up-sell, but not usually. Definitely will return.  [I had to update the stars on this review after eating at another steakhouse. This was a much better cut of steak, thicker and more well marbled.]"}
{"text":"The steak here is very good. I also liked the salad and rolls. It is fairly priced and the staff is very friendly. They have a few tv's to watch the game and it is very comfortable."}
{"text":"I have been to many different locations of Texas Roadhouse over the years and had pretty good experiences. Last night this location was just okay. Upon walking in there was an extremely loud country song playing (to the point of not being able to talk over each other) and it turns out the employees were doing a line dance in the middle of the restaurant. I do know that Texas Roadhouse employees do participate in various line dances throughout the night but this location is particularly \"enthusiastic\" about it. Maybe Saturday nights are country nights? Not sure? But quite obnoxious if you are not into that type of thing.  My fiancé and I were seated in a very small two person table in the back corner of the restaurant next to a party of at least twelve. Our waitress did come over right away and greet us and our drink orders were promptly served. We did find a mystery substance on one of the rolls we were served which was somewhat branch like, maybe a stem of some kind. We ate the other rolls in the basket which were still good and warm. Service was good despite being right next to a very large party. The noise level was quite ridiculous. I also a had a three to four year old child directly behind my seat who was in the most shrill way possible screaming in my ear throughout our dining experience. Yay great way to spend the evening. The Texas Roadhouse birthday announcement was done a total of four times while we there (lots of birthdays last night I guess). It is tolerable maybe once but NOT four times. It goes a little like this - ATTENTION TEXAS ROADHOUSE IT IS (insert name here) BIRTHDAY TONIGHT AND THEY ARE TURNING (insert age here) CAN I GET EVERYONE IN THE PLACE TO GIVE A BIG YEEEEEHAAAAAW!! The party next to us was particularly intoxicated and just about blew my ear drums out with every yeehaw given. After 4 of these I was going a little insane. I needed a shot of vodka stat.  The food was okay. Not bad. The steak that I had was good. Cooked just right and tender. My salad was meh and my fiancé's ribs were a little dry. I have had better Texas Roadhouse experiences in the past. This location is particularly lively. If you enjoy shrill screaming children, drunk obnoxious diners screaming yeehaw multiple times throughout the night and extremely loud country music with line dancing in the middle of the walk way, this is your place. I had never been to a Texas Roadhouse quite like this one."}
{"text":"I have been to this location of Texas Roadhouse a few times and it has always been pretty good. I came here a couple of nights ago because they were donating 10% of the proceeds of your bill to the families of the Yarnell Hill firefighters which I thought was a great cause and my family loves this restaurant.  We had a party of six and we were promptly seated. We were served warm rolls and drinks right away which was great. I ordered a house margarita and it was good and came out really fast. I ordered a sirloin cooked medium and it was cooked to perfection and seasoned well. Everyone else at the table was very pleased with their meal. Our service was also top notch. In classic Texas Roadhouse fashion there were a few birthday's in the house with loud Yeehaw's but it was not near as bad as my prior experience at a different location at Texas Roadhouse.  Overall this restaurant has quality steaks at a good price. A good option for those in the Queen Creek/ east Gilbert area with limited restaurant options. I will be back."}
{"text":"I have been to this location of Texas Roadhouse a couple of times. It has been okay. Not bad, not great. We arrived here pretty late the other night around 9:10 and they closed at 9:30. We asked the hostess if they were still seating for dinner service and she said yes, very kindly. Another young guy on our way back, who was not dressed as if he worked there, yelled back at her as we were being seated \"I thought we were closing - what the hell?!?\" I am figuring that this was her boyfriend or someone waiting for her to get off of work. Either way, it was rude. She tried to ignore him but I could tell it bothered her as well and she could not do anything about it, not her fault, he is clearly and idiot.  We were seated in the bar area and we were greeted right away. The rolls were a little cold but it was after 9pm so I will give them a little leeway on that. They still tasted good. I ordered a 6oz sirloin and my mom had the same. I ordered mine medium rare and she had her's medium well. My steak came out pretty overcooked but still edible. I have had better here in the past. Overall just okay. I also had a cherry limeade with my meal which was delicious. I highly recommend these, especially with a shot of vodka.  Overall my visits here have been okay in general. It is a good place for a decent steak at a low price. The ribs are also good. Have not yet tried a burger. I might be back."}
{"text":"Do not fall for the \"accepts reservations\", they DO NOT !!! and completely unhelpful when it comes to possible wait times even when you called ahead thinking you made a reservation"}
{"text":"We had the cactus onion which was ok. The pulled pork sandwich tasted like beef jerky, as well as smelled like it. The one drink that didn't have tequila somehow got tequila put in it..the rolls and butter were good as long as you like sweet butter."}
{"text":"So everything started out nice for Mother's Day lunch but it didn't stay nice. Received a flower before the meal which was nice but hard to hang on to while eating. Ordered my steak medium well and go it rare. Then they brought it back burnt.... waitress was nice and friendly but they were very busy."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here yesterday and everything was perfect! When we showed up we were worried with the packed parking lot but to our amazement we were seated immediately. Our server Anthony was extremely attentive and we were so thankful! He brought us drinks super fast and was helpful with menu choices. Our food was fabulous! My Dallas filet was perfect. It was done correctly a medium. The flavor was great and it was super tender and juicy. My husbands ribs were fall off the bone! Kids were happy with their choices and sat happily. They throughly enjoyed all the peanuts. Rolls galore! Great meal in a great atmosphere! We will be back positive"}
{"text":"Don't open till 3pm today boo! Meanwhile tgifridays next door is open and getting loads of business. Why don't you guys open for lunch?!"}
{"text":"The service has gone completely downhill. I sat at the bar for ten minutes while the bartender had her back to me, talking with other customers. When she turned around, she still didn't acknowledge me and rang them up instead. Losing Tia and Hailey was the worst thing ever that happened to this place. Well just go to native from now on."}
{"text":"Worst service ever at the bar today for a togo order.  No, it wasn't busy. The bartender was on her phone so much she must have forgotten she was at work. Needless to say I only left a very small amount of change for her \"tip\"."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I ordered my food at 9:00 pm today. I called once was transferred to the person that does carryout, she couldn't hear me call disconnected. I called back again and she took my order. I got there at 9:15 to get my food I ordered 2 catfish meals. I get home and one plate is perfect but my plate was horrible broken pieces of fish some hard, some with cornmeal still wet and yellow. I'm soooooooo disappointed with this Texas roadhouse I will NEVER GO HERE AGAIN. I HOPE NO ONE ELSE GETS THIS KIND OF SERVICE."}
{"text":"My family loves Texas Roadhouse! The only thing here that was comparable to the ones in Louisiana is the bread! The steaks were horrible!! I ordered a NY strip that was the texture of a low grade sirloin. Would not recommend and will not visit again when I come back to NC."}
{"text":"The place was clean and our server Karly was the best!  She was very gracious and attentive to our every need. No wait time and the food came out in a very timely manner.  Cooked to perfection!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Everything was OK until they brough out our drinks..... filthy glasses. They then brought out appetizer plate... big surprise.. also filthy. Then they bring out the chili.... Burnt tasting. They should immediately fire the dish washer. The chili was a fluke as we have had it many times before. The dishes are always dirty at this location. Our waitresses face probably would have broke into a million pieces had she even thought about cracking a smile. The steak was good like usual but that's not enough to earn them an extra star. Shit service and dirty = one star no matter what in my book."}
{"text":"I have had nothing but good experiences at this location. Tonight exceeded all visits, though! Colleen was our server and she is by far the nicest, most genuine person I've ever met. She's very attentive and polite, stating that she was very happy to have us with her tonight. The food was amazing and all around, just a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"The food is incredible, especially the ribs. their sides are A-mazing and their staff is generally friendly. the only con is that everything is way too oversized. I see extremely heavy people eating there and I can't help it but feel like they should make the portions smaller to help people with self control issues. also it would be nice if they carried a larger variety for salad dressings or at least a regular vinigrette for folks who are watching what they're eating. overall, for a protein boost, this is the place to dine!"}
{"text":"After waiting 1 hr for what we were told would be a 20 minute wait. .. we will have to see how the rest of the service is, I will update after dinner. But right now, very poor customer service, lied to multiple times by hostess staff, and manager just hid in kitchen looking at a tablet... not a good start!"}
{"text":"very slow took 45 min for my dinner,found hair in my food,and the steak was poor,very bad.very unhappy."}
{"text":"I love Texas Roadhouse!  My only problem is the consistency of the steaks.  We were recently at a Texas Roadhouse in Terre Haute and had the prime rib which was outstanding, melt in your mouth.  I ordered the prime rib in Champaign and the thing was awful!  Don't know if it is the cooks or the individual restaurant or what.  The last time we went I had the sirloin and it was absolutely the best steak I've ever had!  Having the sirloin next time we go.  Service is always great, Another beef....the veggies I had at Terre Haute were god awful, not even cooked through."}
{"text":"You're not likely to believe me - others didn't - but I spent a whole day pining, searching for a what they call a \"fancy\" pulled pork sandwich -- pulled pork with coleslaw. COLESLAW!!!  Sheesh!  Even Costco has a decent fancy pulled pork sandwich...WITH COLE SLAW!  I must've checked Yelp all day long, for total of at least an hour or more to find the best prospect. Sort of why Yelp is valuable, right?  Honey Bear was my 1st choice but closed too early. Next up?   Texas Roadhouse.   I got there, ordered a beer...find out, they no longer serve  cole slaw. Wait, what?  No longer slaw. Ok. No, not ok. A mess.  Hard to justify to you that my meal was now ruined. But it was.   That was a week ago. Last night, went back for a steak salad. Looked good on the Denny's-like picture-menu. Ah...  First up: rolls and butter. Ugh. If you like these rolls and butter, I'll bet you think those Starbucks frappucino-crap drinks are still coffee. They are not. This bread is so sweet...sweet like Hawaiian Kings which is waaaay too sweet for me.   Not since I last ate BBQ at a TGIFridays, RIP, have I eaten anything that sweet. Certainly not in a bar, that wasn't dessert. Cannot get that horrible sweet out of my mind.   The steak salad was a 6/10. Inferior, cheap cut of meat. flank not properly cooked?  Italian dressing waaaaaaaay too sweet. Outback same steak salad 8/10 -- at least. And not too sweet.   Listen, the place was packed. I'm probably the only one complaining. But if you want to get a cavity from just watching people eat, go to Texas Roadhouse. I'll be back in someone else's lifetime. Horrible food, sweetened beyond need or belief."}
{"text":"Excellent meal , we tried the 6oz and 8oz steak. Perfectly cooked and just the right portion. Definitely on the return to list."}
{"text":"The catfish is amazing..but we go for the ribs..my son is 11 and he can eat two full slabs. My two older kids love the ribs,cheese fries, and corn! I know we should try different things but don't fix whats not broken! Regardless of which location we go to we get the same excellent service! Oh yes...let's not forget about the bread and cinnamon butter...ooh la la"}
{"text":"Go to another chain.  I usually frequent the Texas Roadhouse in Matthews (excellent location), but last minute changes to a dinner plan landed us here at the Concord location.  I actually love this chain restaurant because the ribeyes are decent with a decent price.  Food: I ordered a 16 oz ribeye extra rare with light seasoning, Caesar salad, and plain sweet potato.  I forgot to order the salad with dressing on the side, so they sent my salad out drowned in dressing.  I mean, may have some actual lettuce with that dressing?  My steak was disappointing, but not intolerable.  My steaks usually come out juicy with small hints of juice seeping out, but somehow the fat marbles are still cooked.  This steak, however, was just blah.  No seasoning, no juiciness, it wasn't rare, yet somehow the fat marbles cut/tasted like heat never touched it.  The sweet potato... Oh sweet mama. How do you screw up a sweet potato? You screw it up by overcooking it, then have the nerves to serve it.  Sorry sweet cheeks, but no amount of butter/cinnamon/sugar would cover that taste up.  That may have been the issue, I ordered my potato plain, so perhaps they were saving it to drown it in diabetes?  Who knows? :-S  As for the other diners at my table, one dish came out incorrectly, and we all felt blah about our food.  We also ordered a round of drinks with mixtures of margaritas and beers.  The margaritas were weak, there was a lot of sour mix in it.  I ordered a 22 oz Sam Adam's seasonal, the beer came out in a warm glass, with a crappy beer to foam ratio.  I wasn't happy about that, but at least I got to enjoy the beer 10 minutes later.  Now here's the home run, our waitress was polite and patient.  A situation arrived where another table was being very unruly.  We asked that a manager handle the situation.  Instead of a manager handling it, a waitress went to talk to the table and snickered jokingly.  Hmmmm....?  Anyway, an actual manager came to our table to set things straight.  She apologized and tried to make us happy.  At this point we were already ready to go.  We tipped out our waitress and left.  I won't be back to this location and neither will anyone in my company.  I don't care if my dinner will be free or not.  I'd rather stick to the actual Charlotte area restaurants or grab a burger from down the road."}
{"text":"After the last two visits I felt I should write this review. Four and service have taken a hit. They were very busy so food took a long time. ( which is fine cause we are gonna get it hot right). NOPE. Good was cold. Done didn't eat hardly any of his steak.  Said it was cold.  We sent back both order of kids Mac n Chz I opted for the country fried sirloin and ribs.  The size of the steak was smaller and I still didn't finish it because it was cold as well.  I ate the side of Ribs because BBQ doesn't have to be as warm to enjoy. I hope this review helps the restaurant we used to love going there and the whole family agreed to wait in line there than go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Both the service and food were very good.  Their rolls are served with a sweet cinnamon spread which is delicious.   My prime rib was at the right temperature and the accompanied jus was perfect.   I would not hesitate to go back for my next steak."}
{"text":"I met some family here and after being told it'd be a 15-20 min wait, they proceeded to keep us in a pitiful holding pattern for the next hour.  About 200 people sat down in front of us and finally we left after the managers last lie about sitting us down \"in just a minute\".  The manager utterly fails at his job of \"managing\" his establishment.  I'll never come back to a Texas Roadhouse again."}
{"text":"Had Dinner with a friend last evening here.  The food was amazing!  The Service was impeccable!  My hat goes off to Raymond Garcia the General Manager and his entire team for a Truly Exceptional Dining Experience!  Keep up the good work Ray!  I will recommend your establishment to ALL my friends and family...  Thank You!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go to for a good quality meal without spending a fortune. Not only do they fill you up with peanuts and bread with cinnamon butter), but the meals itself are huge. I usually finish my plate, but I actually had to take some of my dinner home with me. The loaded baked potato was awesome and the steak was cooked just the way I like it. For two meals it only cost me less than $30. $15 a person for two steak dinners isn't bad! My only complaint was the salad I ordered before my meal. It wasn't bad but some the lettuce was a little hard and seemed to be from the core of the head. That just grosses me out. Good experience, though!"}
{"text":"Good environment, good service, good food. Prices are ok. Place is cool looking. Overall, ok restaurant"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food! Luke is a great server! My steak and finances was perfect and the mashed potatoes were on point"}
{"text":"Tried serving a strip and passing it as a ribeye  were willing to correct it but not trying to eat at separate times  They took care of the bill so extra points for doing it right."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time. I got the country friend steak and my girlfriend got the country fried chicken. Both were the size of the plate. Tons of gravy and a scoop of mashed potatoes for both. Which was awesome. This is a noisy restaurant. It would be perfect for kids, parents and the like. The food was good and the service(provided by Jason) was top notch. Thanks for a great first experience. We'll be back. Wicked cinnamon butter btw."}
{"text":"Our first experience at Texas Roadhouse was delightful.  Emily, our server,  provided perfect recommendations.  Our meals (4 of us) from start to finish was delicious.  The manager even checked in on us, making sure we were satisfied with food and service.  The meat on the ribs really does fall off the bone...no false advertising there!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite steakhouses !!! The service here is amazing with the best tasing steaks ! Defiantly my go to whenever I'm craving steak"}
{"text":"Jonah is the best server there!! Such a sweet guy with great service. He made sure everything was perfect and deserves a raise!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went there and requested a booth at the rear of the restaurant. We were quickly accommodated. It appears no wait staff was informed of our presence, but a waitress by the name of Maddie assumed responsibility for us, even though we weren't in her section. It was her outstanding service and initiative that saved our night!  The food was great as always, and staff was very busy, but our steaks came out swiftly, and we'll prepared.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. I usually come with friends but brought my family here. I ordered a steak with shrimp with Mac and cheese. My sister ordered a bbq chicken with a bake potato and some salad. My dad got the chicken with the baked potato. We also got the cactus blossom as well. I usually come here with my buddies to get a beer and watch the games. The service was amazing for a Saturday night. The waitress Cassie was awesome. She's going to school to be a physical therapist and the manager Lindsay was helpful as well. I will always come back here since you can get a good steak to go. Also the bread is amazing as well. They make sure the service is 100% on point. As busy as they were they still took care of me and my family and I appreciate it. They were honest with there wait time and made my families night a good night. Vanessa is a good person to talk to as well"}
{"text":"Good Food, Good Drinks, Great staff!   I am A sea food and pork fanatic!   I stay away from their seafood but LOVE their Fall-off-the-bones-Ribs!. They literally fall off the bone into my mouth!   Their potato skins are so yummy!  Their biscuits are so delightful  but their ribs! OMG!   I really enjoy their raspberry vodka and hurricane with an extra shot of patron!"}
{"text":"Food is generally bad. No seasoning on the steaks--even when I ask for extra. Waitstaff is slow and inattentive. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Dropped in after a movie at 8:30 p.m. and was pleasantly surprised to learn they are open until 10 pm on Weeknights and 11 p.m. on weekends. Nice to have a place open late enough and not feel rushed. Service was professional and pleasant. Not necessarily friendly, but attentive. The food is consistently good. I had the Wed night shrimp and steak special for $10.99. Sirloin and 3 shrimp. Shrimp was overcooked but tasty. The steak was excellent. Cooked to order and very tender. Husband had the rack of ribs with light sauce. Fall off the bone tender and flavorful. Salads were small but do-able. Cheesecake dessert had been frozen and obtained elsewhere, but flavorful. The dinner rolls come with a sweet, cinnamon butter. I wish I had thought to ask for regular butter instead. And ask for extra butter for your loaded baked potato. There isn't much there. The prices, for the food quality and quantity received, was outstanding."}
{"text":"Here with a friend I haven't seen in 3+ years. Great experience, Michelle was our server and was phenomenal. Drinks always filled, food great, etc. Yet another great experience, ty to our server and mgmt staff."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in town. Perfect cooked steaks and great service. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I love Texas Roadhouse. The staff here are great. My steak wasn't cooked to my liking but they tried to make it better."}
{"text":"not the best steak house in town, but it is good enough to feed my hunger.  been going to this location since 2003..  friendly staff.. great atmosphere...and  food is  comforting..    last friday. i was craving steak, so i decided to visit the place with buddy of mine..  waitress was so friendly.. i had to give her $12 tip!! she checked on us every 5 mins.. making sure our drinks were full.. service was great!   i ordered my usual.  rib eye steak medium rare, house salad with ranch dressing.. and cup of chili..  yummy!!   manger of this location knows how to keep their customers happy..  i would give 4 stars.. but you know.. i am picky with my steak.. so 3 is all i can give.. but if it was based on service.. yeah i would of given 4...  if i am feeling red neck and wanting my steak with ice cold beer with unlimited peanuts.. i visit the texas roadhouse... heeeeee  haw!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food for a reasonable price. They have great ribs, burgers and chicken entrees. Probably one of the best house salads of all time. Huge portions and again, the price doesn't break the bank. The freshly made rolls and butter are to die for! Expect a lengthy wait at, but just eat plenty of their free peanuts to tide you over and it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"The waiter brought our food and didn't return to offer drink refills. Leaving me with nothing to drink until I've finished all my food is a deal breaker.  My prime rib and baked potato were warm, not hot.  The mushrooms were ancient.  They were shriveled, black, and tasted bad. The onions were old and mushy.  We weren't offered more rolls as they usually do.   This place is always packed.  I don't understand serving old, warmish food.  You'd think they'd be constantly cooking fresh food for that many customers.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Our party of 10 on a friday night had a decent wait, about 30 minutes, less than expected so that was a good start! The waitress, Courtney, was on top of everything! Super energetic, attentive and friendly! She made the evening out with 6 kids feel like a dream!  Serioously on a friday night when it was jam packed busy we felt like we were her only table! That is an EXCELLENT waitress! The food was fantastic as always also, husband had prime rib (prepared perfectly) and I had pulled pork. Friends had ribs and country fried steak. Kids all devoured their meals also! Thanks for a great night out!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, I called ahead and got my name on the waiting list.  We arrived and it appeared to be at least a 1/2 hour wait.  I went up and checked in and we were seated within 1 minute.  Fantastic service from start to finish.  Great for the kids, including a balloon guy.  The manager even came over and said the appetizer was on the house since it was out first visit.  I had the ribs and my wife had a steak. A lot of food, very affordable prices and great service equals 4 stars."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous to eat at Texas Roadhouse, because of the poor reviews about their service, but my fiancé & I decided to give it a go anyways. We got there at 7:40pm on a Saturday & there was a 25-35 minute wait. Which wasn't a surprised since it was Saturday. There was a ton of people waiting & it made it a little awkward to find a spot that was not in anyone's way.  We waited about 30 minutes before we were seated. Our sever, Andrea (Drea on her name tag) was fantastic!! She made sure that everything was refilled before we were empty, which for me is a huge deal. She was very friendly & checked on our table regularly. I give Drea alone 5 stars!! I was pleased with my rib eye expect for the fact I ordered medium rare & it came out medium. I think the quality of food for your money is great!!  The only thing that was a little off putting was the loud music & every once in awhile the servers had to dance. It kinda felt like we were having dinner at a bar, which I didn't care for."}
{"text":"Service was good! And I had to slow myself down! The tea glasses had partials stuck to them. Then my salad plate was very questionable- if the dishwasher is working properly with its sterilization everything should be fine, but you have to ? If it's working properly. Then my salad bowl showed similar issues. Ordered the chicken critter salad I've had multiple times here and the Temperature of the chicken varies, sometimes hot, sometimes cold. When I asked the waitress, it was explained I got cold chicken because of the other meal taking so long. Oh, did I mention it did take quite awhile from order to the time  food was delivered to the table. I'm going to have to put the place back on the bottom of where to eat. May let the party I'm with eat here and I'll go to the other place just across the way! I did speak with a supervisor, then had a longer one as we left. It is one place I hadn't had a bad experience in a long while."}
{"text":"To begin, I have been to several Texas roadhouse locations all over the salt lake UT valley and in other states. This was the worst Texas roadhouse I have ever been to. They are known for their rolls, and a big reason I continue to come here. The rolls here were tiny and lacked in the cinnamon spread. Our second  batch of rolls has hair in it. I ordered a baked potatoe as my side and it was so burnt and over cooked I could not push my fork through the skin. My second side were steak fries but unfortunately I didn't get any fries with my salt (intended). Lastly the salad was very small and almost no lettuce. Mostly cheese and croutons."}
{"text":"Only gave them a 1 start because I like their food . First off I would like to say as yelper I've only ever left 1 bad review . Again this is my opinion so here it goes .  I absolutely LOVE the food and the bread is to die for ! The new your steak strip is my favorite !  Now customer service  IS HORRIBLE when it comes to the hostess. I understand that we came at a busy time and there is call ahead waiting but the policy I think. Reds a little revision. So you can call ahead BUT all your party has to be here . I think this is a little unfair I understand why they do it I've known people that have worked in the restaurant business before and I get it but my party of 7 was only missing 1 person and they wouldn't seat me . I was going to order for the person and everything but no couldn't even get on the wait list . I've been to places where if at least 80% of the party is here they would seat you.   Back to the hostess - when I asked if I can at least be out on standby she said \"um nope al your party has to be here \" but in a very snarky stuck up way . They she proceeds to talk to the other hostesses and say \"ugh I hate working weekends I have to deal with these people \"   Sorry you hate your job you choose to work in The food / customer service industry  So now we get seated 45 mins later because the 1 person wasn't here and my server took about 20 mins to get us drinks and our food took about another 30mins  Don't know if it was an off day or maybe the staff or location but never have I had this type of \"I hate my job\" environment. Don't believe I'll be returning to this location . Disappointing to say the the least"}
{"text":"This is the first time at the Texas Roadhouse. The reason I give them a 2 star is because of the parents who let their kids scream and jell  in the restaurant and no body on the staff does anything to quite them down.This is a complete turn off. You go there to enjoy yourself and you bring friends with you and this is what happens, not to come out of the restaurant a with your friends and myself saying this is the last time here.Now as for the food I did not find anything wrong the service excellent the food great , The management is a minus a star hopefully they will do something about this problem the next time."}
{"text":"Ordered online on a busy Saturday evening and took us 15 minutes just to find a place to park to pick up the order.   They told me on the phone to pick it up in the to go room which isn't labeled from the outside door.  Once we got there, they had an issue with their register so credit cards were taking 10-15 minutes for approval...wish I would have known that before and I could have grabbed some cash from the ATM or cancelled the order and gone somewhere else.  Waited almost thirty minutes and it still wasn't approved, not to mention the food was sitting there not under a heater or anything just getting cold.  Was told it would be heavily discounted if we wanted to wait...no thanks, I don't feel like waiting another hour or so.  Cancelled and went somewhere else that could accommodate the customers needs.  They had us wait almost an hour and after all the hassle couldn't do anything but void our order.  No free food, no nothing.  Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"One of favorite place to have steak! The steak was perfect tonite and this really pretty waitress I think her name was Brittany was so nice! Love this place !"}
{"text":"Had a Bone-in Ribeye and at the side (you are allowed to order two sides without any extra-charge) a potato and a sweet-potato. It was really delicious. Meet was on point and the potatoes were not to dry. You like beer, try the summer-ale. Refreshing ale really good after a hot day and together with a diner like that.   Staff is great!   Will come again..."}
{"text":"Great service! Yummy food! When we left I asked my husband - why don't we come here more often?\" Natasha is the best server we've ever had"}
{"text":"Food was good but watched two tables come after us and eat before us as our ticket \"was lost.\"  Go somewhere else; service sucks."}
{"text":"If you want of the best steaks you have ever had in Illinois. Be sure and ask for the Dallas filet with mushrooms. It will melt in your mouth if you have your steaks medium. And it will actually be cooked medium ! Many other places that I have gotten a steak from can never get it cooked right, and is tasteless. Be sure and try some of their house steak sauce also. It has a slightly sweet taste to it ! Usually I don't use any at all. But theirs taste really good. Remember a dab will do. Don't drown the natural taste of their steaks."}
{"text":"Just tried TR with the family - again.  My Ribeye came out too rare, made several cuts to find a good piece. They took it back to \"refire\". About 10min later I was given all my pieces back. I would like to say it was good, but looked too much like burnt dog food, too scared to try. I asked to have the meal removed and the waitress asked what was wrong with it. I explained that it did not look too appetitising and her comment was \"isn't it the way you cut it up or did we do that.\" After 15min my waiter came back with the check saying my manager took care of my meal.  Would have been nice to see this manager before we left. Total time in the restaurant was 1.5 hours."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. Food is generally fresh and tasty. Atmosphere just what you would expect from the name. Try the roasted chicken."}
{"text":"My family of 9 reserved a table here for Mother's Day and I was so surprised how amazing their service was! The whole restaurant was packed yet all the staff was busy making the experience top notch. Our drinks were never empty, our meals arrived in just the right amount of time, and our server was the sweetest and most courteous. I was very impressed!   I have been to many restaurants where they are not quite as packed yet the service lacks terribly. The servers are not friendly or attentive and the food would take forever to get there!  So this was definitely a happy surprise. :-) Our server made our experience wonderful, especially since it was Mother's Day and we were trying to make my mom feel special. Thank you so much Texas Road House!   Now on to the food: we ordered snakebites for appetizers which were very tasty! They were cheesy and gooey. I ordered a Bahama margarita with an extra shot. It was a bit too sweet but delicious. I also ordered the vegetable plate where I got to pick four sides. It was marvelous! I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Very very Dissatisfied. 2 days ago we ordered Takeout. 2-8oz Sirloin and 1-11oz Sirloin. Both 8oz Medium and the 11oz Medium Rare with all 3 getting Loaded. As I pay for our meal the Hostess or whomever kept Staring at me. I was on a phone call and asked the person Do I tip for carry out?  There was 2 other carry outs before me. The girl brought their bags out and handed it to them. She brings mine out and pulls me to the side she takes every bit of mine out of the bag spilling the salad. So she takes it to the back and brings me back the same container. You could tell because of the way the styrofoam was crunched. Ok now I get home and mind you it's 9pm. The 2-8oz steaks was so raw and the 11oz was dry and cooked well done. I called and spoke to the Manager Jestine(I believe). Rude as Hell.  Said I could pick up the same that night. It was way to late. So we asked about the next day. She advised no said she had no authority. But could mail us a certificate. We all know that will never happen. It's a dam shame I paid in cash. After a while if being very rude my boyfriend took the phone and she was ruder but said she would have Mike call us yesterday. No response. I called twice and got no where. I called today and OMG she was ruder saying she told us Mike had a Cater to serve. First off No she didn't. But you can argue that on the phone. But what I can argue, all of our phone calls are recorded. Thinking on sending the call to the Corporate Office. When we pay that much and FYI- we paid all the extras for Loaded potatoes. Wrong, they was plain and Very  Very Dry!!!  Yikes, it's making me give a star. I guess I will give that for the peanuts as we didn't get any rolls. Maybe because they was closing at 9:30 and I was there at 845"}
{"text":"I usually love the service here. The Bar tender Alicia was to busy taking care of her kids at the bar. Our beer mugs where empty and she did not bother to offer us more beer or if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"Once again, we had an almost thoroughly enjoyable meal here. We were greeted and seated immediately by a friendly hostess. It took a couple of minutes for our server, Kyle, to greet us, which was fine because I was waiting for my husband to come in from parking the car. Our orders were taken with a minimum of up selling. Tea glasses were filled before they were empty and the food was delivered within 15 minutes. Our steaks were juicy, and my baked sweet potato was amazing. My only complaint is the music. I get that this isn't an upscale setting, but it's still a family restaurant. If the music is too loud to talk over, then it's too loud."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in Phoenix before going to monument valley and were just looking for a reasonable place to eat! We were not familiar with Texas roadhouses and were pretty surprised by the whole experience! The handmade rolls you get when you take a seat are the most delicious! I could not get enough! We both had steaks with vegetables to make our stay the most healthy (which is really hard with the huge amount of food that is offered)! The steaks were actually amazing! I could not believe that we found this place by accident and never been there before! Everyone was so caring and nice!!"}
{"text":"To begin with, the bread rolls and butter you recieve as you sit are to die for. It's the best way to start your meal. It is the most perfect smooth and fluffy cinnamon honey butter on the planet. In addition, they give you a bucket full of peanuts. Then you order a starter or whatever it is you want off the menu. I always like to get a baked potatoe, mashed potatoes with gravy, and grilled shrimp with rice. In conclusion, Texas Roadhouse is where anyone can get a great meal and have a good time all for a good price."}
{"text":"Kraft Mac and cheese. Seriously. And don't come with a large party. They have no clue how to handle it. I really am in shock how poor this service was."}
{"text":"Wanted to take out the family for a great steak(from what I had heard) since we were visiting from California.There were 9 in our party. We called ahead so were seated as soon as we got there. Our waitress was great took our order quickly, kept our glasses & bread filled :) When the food started coming out they have you check your steak is done how you wanted. 3 of the 7 steaks went back, when mine came back it was still under done,sent it back again came back under done again!!!! Eventually came back done but by them I was full on bread. The manager took two of the steaks off to make it better. I may try it again(not this location)"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent customer of this place. My kids absolutely love coming here. Tonight (11/7)my son and I went in for a late dinner, they weren't as busy as they usually are but the hostess wasn't all there. She asked how many in my party is said 2 & she walked away to talk to someone else, after their conversation she asked 2 other parties how many people were in their party and had them seated. My son and I just stood there. I was so disappointed in the behavior & the customer service. I'm someone that's there twice a week sometimes 3 times due to work meetings & now this specific location has left a bad taste in my mouth.  We came back today (11/8) after church because my son really wanted it. The staff was absolutely wonderful  the manager knew about what happened last night and apologized and took care of us which he didn't have to. I'm going to assume Saturday's late night was a bad night for this location because Sunday lunch time was amazing."}
{"text":"We are visiting the area from OKC to attend my husband's work conference- a bunch of restaurant chain GMs who meet yearly. We LOVE Texas Roadhouse and visit often back home in OKC. Our home location has set the bar pretty high in all areas of restaurant experience, I'll admit, but this location really fell flat.   The hostess started walking us to our table before it was even clean. I found it very odd. We all stood there, just awkwardly watching the busser clean the table. Before he had even finished (we obviously hadn't sat down yet), the hostess sat the plates and silverware down and wished us a good meal and walked away. It seemed a bit rude, but whatever. Not that big of a deal, although odd.  It took several minutes for anyone to come by to greet us and get our drink order. It was probably about 7-10 minutes or so. As a former server, and sitting at a table with 3 current restaurant GMs, we found that outrageous. Finally the server came by and got our drink orders. We were also ready to order since we'd sadly had several minutes to decide before he even showed up.  Then, the food seemed to take forever. My 3 year old, whom I will admit was already tired, actually fell asleep before it arrived. At least the four salads came out fast and tasted good, but nobody ever offered more bread to us and the server didn't even stop back to check on us while we waited for the food. We stacked up our salad bowls, forks, and small plates at the end of the table and watched him walk by it countless times, empty handed. Again a big strike for us. He stopped by to grab the dishes after being stacked there for quite awhile, and didn't offer anything else or really check on us.  Finally he brought out our food but had another server pass it all out as he rushed away, saying he'd be right back. He did not come right back.   My husband and I both ordered medium rare steaks- mine was fortunately cooked perfectly (although had several tough, chewy pieces) but his was cooked medium. He mentioned to the other server that it was a bit overcooked but not to worry about it; we were hungry and not willing to wait any longer.  Our server came back nearly halfway through the meal to check on us. Honestly it wasn't worth us listing out all our complaints because he didn't seem too interested in us in the first place and we figured it would take half an hour before he got back with us, anyways. Ironically, his name was that of a very fast plane...  We had empty glasses and had to ask a nearby server to get our server for some refills. He didn't even bother asking the waiter to take care of it- maybe he's used to this happening. He grabbed us more drinks himself. I watched as a young couple (also in our server's section) waiting entirely too long to receive their first round of beverages.  It seemed he only had 3 tables total, and several times I saw him stand and playfully converse with coworkers at the POS station like he had nothing to do, so I was a bit confused as to why he wasn't more attentive. We are very easy customers who rarely complain but would not come back to this location if we lived in the area. I am used to seeing a manager walk around and touch tables, making sure everyone has been served appropriately, so it was strange not seeing that- I'm not sure I saw a manager at all, actually, and I was definitely looking for one.  We had to ask for our check and he didn't offer to split it. We were afraid it would take too long to have it corrected so we just used cash to chip in on our portions so we could leave. :/"}
{"text":"Very disappointed this evening to be told no baked potatoes. That's a big reason I go out for a steak to have a salad & baked potato! French fries not even close."}
{"text":"Second time here and the second time it was lousy. We walked in and they said they would seat us in a minute. Then they gave the beeper to everyone that came in after us, and then started to seat them while we waited. I complained and they still seated people that came after us. They did not seat us until after I complained loudly to the manager on duty. Then after we were seated it was more than five minutes before they came to take our order.  I will not come back again and I don't recommend this place just because of the lousy service."}
{"text":"Our waitress this evening was awesome ll Tallee great job serving us this Sunday evening !  The food was very well prepared! Expect peanut shells to be everywhere but food quality is right on par with the price.  Good family environment !  The booster seat that goes in the booth next to the patent is amazing makes dinner out easy and enjoyable !"}
{"text":"Despite living ten minutes away, I generally avoid going to Norterra as often as humanly possible. Several years ago, I bitterly nicknamed the round-about as the \"Circle of Death,\" due to the fact that few drivers in Phoenix actually know what to do when encountering one on the road.  This complaint aside, I do make occasional exceptions when the situation calls for it. When I noticed that a Texas Roadhouse was opening up in the shopping center, we decided we'd give them a try.  I'm typically not a big fan of chains. It's not just the food itself, but having to deal with the massive crowds all clogging up the restaurant, forcing you to wait ridiculous amounts of time for food that is never quite as good as they seem to think it is. Roadhouse, however, actually isn't too bad when it comes to their food. Former colleagues and myself used to frequent another location during lunch hour, finding that, while the food isn't quite mind-blowing, it's at least consistently good and cheap by the standards of many other places.  As another review pointed out, it appears that everyone who lives within a ten mile radius of the restaurant that isn't dining here is most likely working here. The crowd for an early 6pm Friday night bordered on flat-out annoying. But I guess that's always the case whenever you open up a new restaurant in an area that's largely void of any real entertainment besides going to Harkins.  Unfortunately, despite adding a new restaurant, they forgot that it might be a good idea to add additional parking as well. We were forced to park almost a mile away from the restaurant.  Wait time was about an hour to get in, but once seated, our service was actually decent. If they fibbed and claimed to have been in operation for a year, I could have easily been fooled. Their bread rolls with cinnamon butter were as good as they've always been. We both ordered six ounce sirloins, which were cooked properly and are actually pretty decent quality for the 9.99 asking price. I opted for loaded mashed potatoes and corn, as I was quite distraught to discover that they ran out of my beloved mac and cheese earlier in the day (those damned kids - I'll get them for this!). My girlfriend's salad was passable and she had no complaints about her baked potato.  For the standards of a chain, the food is decent, the price is cheap, and the service seemed to be spot-on. I don't see us becoming regulars, as there are far better places to go for a good steak (with significantly less wait time). But for what it is, I'm sure it'll serve the community quite well.  Recommended if you're in the right mood."}
{"text":"Food was ok, not good, just ok. Bartender/server very uneducated to specific requests (nothing crazy, requested pint glass... no extra booze just more soda). Manager acted like we were a nuesance when we gave the feedback, and snapped at us. So if you are looking for a mediocre meal, incorrect drinks, and management who could care less if there is an issue... this is your place. With so many places to eat around here, it would be nice to be treated like a customer, not gum on the bottom of a shoe. Not well played Texas Roadhouse, not well played at all."}
{"text":"Alright even though I'm leaving the restaurant and have to listen to Nicki Minaj I will say the dinner this evening was pleasant. We had to wait 10 to 15 minutes for a table but it wasn't so bad.  We went up to the bar and had a couple margarita, that seems to make things a lot more tolerable. Tara was our server tonight and I think she was awesome. Once again it could have been based on the influence of a margarita, it was a good margarita, but with an additional shot of  tequila how could it be bad?!  Anyway, I wasn't especially hungry and ate less than half of my entrée. Thought it tasted pretty good, delivery of the entree was within a reasonable period of time, Tara was consistent and checking in with us just see if everything was okay -bringing water if we needed it, ordering up another cocktail if we wanted one and offered to bring more bread if we wanted it ( oh my God, no more bread ). Meals were tasty, enough to share and all was satisfying. I can suggest you start with a couple margs while you nosh on the peanuts and just hope real hard Tara is your server. Another option, ask for Tara."}
{"text":"Had to wait 10 minutes for our server to greet us..after asking the bartender and another server where they were. It was 10 pm and really slow in there, ordered chicken tenders (how can you go wrong with those) and they tasted like they had sat out for hours."}
{"text":"The wait time was exactly what was estimated. The hostess was was nice. The waitress was awesome. Recommended a great drink and brought bread nonstop. My steak was a little on the rare side but that's fine I never eat the whole thing and it makes for great leftovers.  Both my waitress and manager asked how everything was cooked.  I would say it was a good visit"}
{"text":"Sweet potato was great Ribs were not as good as last time, bar staff ignored me once I got my  food and I'm still waiting for my check, probably won't come back to this place"}
{"text":"We heard this place was good. We thought that it must be, because every time we tried to go, they were super-busy, so we would end up going somewhere else. Finally got in one Saturday (mid-afternoon) and we weren't impressed; the food was just blah. All that build-up for nothing. LOL! The people were nice though. :)"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. The food is always good and so is the service. But they recently took away my favorite go-to dish. On top of that the wait is always ridiculous even on a weeknight. They don't take reservations but you can call ahead to get your name in the list but they ask that you come in the next 20 or 39 minutes and the wait is usually around an hour. Its gotten so bad that it's not worth waiting for anymore especially because I can't order what I want."}
{"text":"Predictable but above average fair.   Ribs were A- and the fries we're truly outstanding.   Green beans has a slight smoke to it - makes it interesting.   Red chili was a slight disappointment.   Overall a decent place and I would certainly pair it against any other chain.   A good choice if one is nearby and you just want to have a quick, predictable happy hour and meal. 2.75 stars if I could pick it..."}
{"text":"We checked out the newest restaurant of the Norterra area, the Texas Roadhouse. From the moment you walk in, you are treated like royalty. Greeted at the door, greeted at the hostess counter, and quickly taken to a table. Our sever was Hawley, and she was perfect! Our waters, cocktails, and bread never sat empty. Her knowledge of menu was appreciated as it was our first time, and she gave some great recommendations. The food was fresh and hot. It really feels like a team atmosphere with the staff. Every so often you get a little entertainment with a line dance. Go check it out. Don't let the parking lot fool you, because the theatre can take up allot of the spaces. This is a large restaurant it would take an army to fill it. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This a great place to eat. It's a great date night. Great food; drinks and the rolls are to die for. I highly recommend this place as the place to go for steaks"}
{"text":"Went last night with a couple friends and we were there a few months ago. Had very good meals both times. Last night, I had the traditional New York Strip and it was cooked perfect. Steak was delicious and the baked potato was very good too. Place was packed for a Thursday night and we sat at the bar. Nate the bar tender gave excellent service. For the price, you can't beat it. Looking forward to return."}
{"text":"Overall: Carry-out experience was great with the dedicated parking and staffed section of the restaurant.  Food was very good except for the mac and cheese, which like eating paper.   Food: 4 stars.  The ribs were excellent; fall off the bone.  Rib-eye steak was cooked perfectly and tasted good.  Fried pickles were soggy.  The worst part was the mac and cheese, which tasted like boxed Kraft Mac and Cheese.  For a claimed BBQ place, how can you have awful mac and cheese?!  Service: 5 stars.  For carry-out, they have designated parking and a stand alone section of the restaurant with a dedicated employee.  This makes it very convenient.  Pricing: 3 stars.  About what you'd expect for a casual BBQ/steak restaurant."}
{"text":"This is always a fun place to be. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the noise level was crazy the last time we visited and we had the hardest time talking to each other while eating. The food is always great-you need to have the rattlesnack bites for sure!"}
{"text":"This is the first time eating here but it was amazing! We told them it was our first time and we got a free appetizer and a coupon for another one! The food was all very tasty, the waitress made great recommendations, and our 3 year old enjoyed all the dipping sauces. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Oh, my, god. Essentially anything you get here will be awesome. Is it pricey? Yeah. Is it worth it? Ohhh yea!   Fall off the bone ribs, amazing pulled pork, oh my goodness."}
{"text":"So I love texas roadhouse. At least texas did something right! heyyy ohhh  Anyway, I always go to the one up on bell road, but it seems every time I go there, I get horrendous service. I came into this location today, great food as always, but I've got to give a big shout out to the server Thomas. By far the best service I've ever had at texas roadhouse."}
{"text":"Nasty!!!! This location was gross when we went in for dinner recently. They sat myself and my wife in the back were it appears they seat families with kids. The floors were utterly gross. The floor was covered in old food apparently thrown down by the younger diners. What made it worse was the fact that the employees and other diners were walking around in it. We said something to our server who wiped up a small section near us. The rest of the floor went uncleaned. It's apparent that neither the employees nor the management team cares as to what the place looks like, and we saw management walking around. The steak was mediocre at best. I had the boneless 10oz rib eye that looked like it had been hammered down. It was the thinnest rib eye i have ever seen. Subsequently, it got dry pretty quick. We have decided not to eat at this location anymore. If they don't care what the dining room looks like I can only imagine the kitchen."}
{"text":"I love this place! Cheap food and you get a lot. My go to is the country fried chicken with their white gravy so delicious. Service is always excellent. Will continue to go here!"}
{"text":"We informed waitress it was our 50th anniversary, not even a happy anniversary from her.  Ordered the 10oz rib eye with baked potato.  Ate only 1/4 of steak couldn't eat any more way too much salt.  Took the rest of the steak home washed it off thoroughly and invited our dogs to join us for our anniversary.  We won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Our waitress Sylvia rules. You are lucky if you get her!!  Fall off the bone ribs were perfect today.  bread was amazing!!!  If you have never tried the chili .... go right now and try it .... holy crap its good"}
{"text":"I came in for dinner yesterday, Mothers Day. Levi Jo was my server and let me just say he was INCREDIBLE.  I was a party of four. my mom is extremely picky and had one of the most pleasant experiences ever! our drinks were filled to the top at all times, we were given a free appetizer coupon which Levi suggested the cheesy fries and they were great! delivered no longer than five minutes after being ordered. our food came out hot and correct down to the tee! I love Levi and he made my first visit at Texas Roadhouse memorable.  I will be back for the amazing service and tasty food!!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for - If we are all honest here, TX Roadhouse is fairly cheap for what you get. I'll admit the long wait is annoying - So we always plan on that each time (or call ahead). They have awesome food and friendly staff. The staff has messed up my order a few times at different locations, but they are human and are trying their best. I realize I'm not royalty - As long as they're friendly, I'm fine. I love their bread, butter, house salads, ceasar salads, sweet postatoes, etc.... I love TX Roadhouse! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Great experience this time at this location. We eat at Texas Roadhouse regularly and this time was especially good. Our server was Shannon and she was friendly, efficient and did an above average job -- we want to be sure her manager knows !  We went on a Saturday early evening and of course, it was busy. We used Call-Ahead Seating and were seated quickly (what a great feature).  We always order the Dallas Filet steak and mine was excellent. I ordered it Medium-well because it is usually under-cooked. This time is came out perfect (Medium) and the most tender steak I have had in a long time.  My husband ordered his Medium and had to send it back (that's what usually happens to me). His steak was no where near as tender as mine this time. I ended up sharing mine while his was re-cooked and we took most of his home with us to eat the next day. We come to Texas Roadhouse because we know we will get a good steak and feel satisfied with the price."}
{"text":"Arrived at 6 p.m. tonight - We'd called ahead and only waited about 5 minutes.  Waitress Trisha (?) arrived promptly and explained menu to us (pretty self explanatory...these are the appetizers, the salads, etc), took our drink order and returned with our drinks.  Our dinner guests arrived - we waited 15+- minutes, flagged down another waitress to please take drink order of our guests.  Trisha arrived with refills for us - told guest their drink order was on it's way.  The margarita took at least 30 additional minutes to arrive!   Ordered, explained in detail, no pickle, lettuce, tomato or onions on cheese burger...plain - meat & bun; explained salmon order, sauce on the side.   Dinner order arrived, burger was not plain, pickle on plate and the runner forgot one of our sides.   Waited awhile, no one came to check on us - flagged down a runner and asked for other side.  Trisha returned to table to check on us, I explained that I was not happy, burger ordered, not delivered, missing side.  She said she was sorry but hadn't heard me order a plain burger!   Really, we had a huge discussion about it.  Skip the dancing and work on your people skills.   Very surprised a manager didn't arrive at our table to ask what the problem was.   Won't be back!"}
{"text":"I freaking love Texas Roadhouse. The buttered rolls and cinnamon butter are to die for. The margaritas are refreshing and delicious. Steak is juicy. This place is the bees knees."}
{"text":"I love Country Fried Steak! Few do it better! Real steak, awesome white gravy! Would give 5  except for the disappointing portion of mashed potatoes, and overall food temperature. Side salad also very satisfying (I recommend the Honey Mustard dressing)! Next visit I won't pass up my favorite appetizer: the blooming onion!"}
{"text":"This was an enjoyable evening.  Service an food was excellent!! The wait was longer than estimated, only cause the employees were so energetic with the line dancing. Didnt seem like patrons wanted to leave!! Been to most of the roadhouses in Phoenix. This is my favorite!! Our waiter was on top of everything. And this had to be one of the best steaks I've had!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! We went to Texas Roadhouse on a very busy Saturday night. Despite the crowds our food was served promptly, fresh and hot. The ribs were fall off the bone and the ribeye steak was tender and cooked to temperature. Our waitress, Sierra, was excellent. We could see she had many tables, but stilled delivered hot rolls, kept our drinks full, and stopped back to ask how we were doing multiple times. The manager even made time to stop and ask how our meal was. On the way out, 3 different workers told us good night and someone even held the door open. 5 stars for customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Food is top notch here!  Everything was so good,  my only problem was that I was full before I could finish my plate!  Complimentary dinner rolls that come warm and buttered.  Customer service was great even with the long line we are at our table within 5 minutes! Definitely coming back and recommend this location!"}
{"text":"So this location my family and I have visited several times. We watch large groups 10+ come in and are accommodated quickly even if everyone in the party has not arrived yet.   Today my family and I arrive (party of 7). My mother, sister and two nephews arrive before my wife, kid and I do. My mother is told that they will not accommodate us until everyone arrives our party even though we were less than 5 minutes away. That alone is strange but ok.  We all are now in the lobby and ready to be seated to only be told we now have to wait which immediately frustrated me. As we stood patiently waiting, we watched one large party after another walk in and are seated immediately. At this point I'm very frustrated and am ready to take our business somewhere else.   After some time we were finally seated and noticed we are under an air conditioning vent. No big deal however it got very cold for the young kids we had with us. We asked our server if the air could be adjusted. The server comes back and says that management will adjust the fan. Fifteen minutes later and no change was made. We asked to speak with management and basically received no response.   I'm not sure if we will return to this location again. We definitely are not satisfied with the service provided this time around."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. They made balloon animals for our kids. A nice time out of the house!"}
{"text":"It's a fun kind of place as chains go.  I've never eaten a steak here, as I typically don't eat a steak much of anywhere.  Just one of those things, I guess.  It's meat.  I can grill.  I don't need to overpay to have someone do it for me.  And, even though I avoid chain restaurants like a plague, this one stands out for the right reasons.  Regardless, I like coming here.  I tend towards the chicken and ribs combo.  The portion size is decent, and, in a handful of visits, I've never had cause to complain.  The food has been hot, it's tasted good, and it's been correct.  Drinks are typical with the level of quality and size of ChiliAppleFriday's, but, for whatever reason, I've only drank beer in the couple times I've been to this one.  And then, how can you come here and not love the rolls with the cinnamon butter.  They're right up there with the cheddar biscuits at Red Lobster.  And peanuts.  I don't seek out peanuts.  But, like popcorn, if you put it in front of me, I'll eat them.  And then throw the shells on the ground.  Best business decision ever.  If you know people are going to drop them anyway, just tell them to from the start.  The location is okay, but I feel like the area is just very quiet in terms of what else is around it.  I will say though, that the service provided here was a lot more on point than the location in Waukesha.  On our first visit, I was impressed because my girl asked if I was going to get another beer and I'd said yes.  The server heard from the other side of our aisle and had one over to me in two minutes.  Nice work.  And yes, this is a cookie cutter chain review.  But there are subtle differences."}
{"text":"The worst 50$ dinner I have ever had.  The only reason this place is getting 2 stars is because our server was awesome.  We got rattle snake bites, flavorless, tasted like they came from a frozen bag which im sure they did. My husband got a 16 ounce steak, garden salad and potatoes. The salad was so weird tasting, like no flavor and tasted watery. My husband said the steak was one of the worst steaks he has ever had, he left more than half of it on the plate when we left and didn't touch his mashed potatoes.  My daughters mac n cheese was kraft which is no problem but it was so dry she wanted nothing to do with it.   I had the California salad and I have no complaints about it, it was actually decent.  I used to go to roadhouse all the time and even worked at one for a short period of time and I do believe the quality of food has just gone downhill."}
{"text":"Free onion petal from Yelp. Why not? We were on the east side, en route home from Milwaukee and we were all hungry. Texas Roadhouse solved that problem with unlimited rolls and cinnamon butter, the onion petal and portions large enough to feed an average-sized Mormon family. After the rolls, the onion petal and the complimentary peanuts in the shell, the first of my meal's two sides arrived -- a nice cup of beefy chili covered with cheddar and onions. I was officially full by the time my rib-and-chicken combo arrived with a side of creamy, scallion-topped mashed potatoes. It was all above average if not swanky-steakhouse quality, but I didn't expect that for the price. The ribs were grilled not smoked, tender and the sweet sauce was nice, although not very Texas-like. The chicken was a juicy, thick boneless/skinless breast, grilled and slathered in the same sauce. The wife had the same chicken breast, but hers was on a sandwich. Her steak fries were nothing special. Our son's steak was ordered medium well, cooked right, and neither tough nor grisly; our daughter's chicken tenders were, well, fried chicken tenders. Nothing offensive other than the nutritional hell-hole in which we allow our kids to live. You can tell their meats are not frozen. Feather in their cap. Careful on your way to the restroom. The grease from the kitchen makes the floor back there as slick as the Beltline after a fresh December snowfall. The line dancing by the very friendly staff is a corny cliche that non-Texans apply to Texas, but I get what they're trying to do.   I wouldn't make a special trip to Texas Roadhouse, but if there's one in the neighborhood at the right time of day, I might stop in."}
{"text":"I had the 5 oz salmon with green beans and mashed potatoes. It was all very delicious! Not giving a full 5 stars solely because of the service. The server was very nice, however my fiancé ordered a water and our waitress gave him a coke instead. She noticed her mistake and apologized, but he never received his water. We will go here again."}
{"text":"What fun we had at Texas Roadhouse tonight celebrating my Nephews Birthday!  Our waitress Joni was great and so was the food. This place gets really busy on the weekends, so expect a wait if you have a good size group."}
{"text":"You know it's bad when you walk out of a restaurant annoyed and stressed....  My husband and father-in-law decided we were going to go out for steak, our experience here was horrible. The only reason why this restaurant is getting 2 stars is because the food was actually good. The rest of the experience was a nightmare.  We get there and we're the 1st people to get put on the waiting list. Our number is 102. We sit for about 5 minutes and then our number is called, so we wander up to the hostess stand. The girl seating people grabbed the wrong couple 108. Not sure how you go from 102 to 108, but she was clueless and her co-workers voiced their opinion of her in that respect. We get seated and ask for a sling since we can't shove the car seat into the booth. I guess the manager of the store doesn't have any common sense, because the slings they have are like 2ft tall, and the table is much higher than that. You pretty much have to sit on the very edge of the seat to see your baby, even when you've pulled the sling right next to you. If this wasn't bad enough, we were seated right at the mouth of the runway, so we ran the risk of having my child run over by everybody that went through. At this point, im pretty stressed, and we haven't even ordered drinks yet!  Our waitress comes up, some blonde bimbo (and I'm being nice), and I have no idea what she was saying because:  1. It was extremely loud. 2. She was talking so fast that everything seemed to run together. 3. The kids behind us were screaming... in my ear (I will get to this later).  Instead of asking her to repeat what she just said, I just ordered my food and hoped that it would turn out right. Through the meal, she didn't come back much, so needless to say our drinks were not filled and the rolls never came back after the 1st batch was gone.  While we're waiting, we try to have a conversation but this proved to be difficult. The way the seats are, if you're in a booth, the backs of the booth is connected to another one, so if you lean back a little, you'll hit the person sitting behind you. Now that you have this picture, put 2 really annoying and screaming toddlers behind you. During my meal, I had:  1. My hair pulled 2. Slobbered on 3. Screamed in my ear 4. Hit in my head and back numerous times by fists, feet, and balloon animals. 5. Kid fell on our side of the bench, had to shove it back over  Yes, I understand that the parents there should have contained their animals, but the problem I have is that this wouldn't have happened if the benches weren't hooked together in such a tight place. I also noticed that we were stuck in the section with nothing but screaming kids, I did not appreciate that at all. Just because I have a kid, doesn't mean it's going to act an idiot in a restaurant so please don't put me with the rest of the zoo.  Finally, we receive our food. The waitress hung the tray of food RIGHT OVER MY BABY. I wanted to slap this girl for not having any brains! I ordered the NY Strip, med rare with sautéed mushrooms, and loaded mashed potatoes. The meat was cooked a little too rare (it was still pretty cool in the middle), but at that point, I was ready to woof down my food and get the hell out of there. I ended up taking my time and enjoyed my food. The mushrooms did not overpower the taste of the steak and the potatoes were slightly seasoned with garlic, just the way I like it. My husband and father-in-law all had good things to say about their rib eye. We all pretty much had the same sides, salad and potatoes so overall the actual food was pretty tasty.   With all that said, this place does have good steak, but go either early dinner time before the crowd gets there or go for lunch. Hopefully you'll have better luck than I did."}
{"text":"Food is good, service in the carry out area is terrible! It wasn't busy at all and the girl doing carry out was Messing up orders left and right."}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse!  I love this place!  Their T-Bone steak is the best.  I love the flavor of their house salad and house vinaigrette dressing.  The bread is really good but it has changed a little bit over the years.  95% of the time I come here, I get an excellent server.  It seems like service is best around the bar area...at least the servers are the best 100% of the time around the bar...not that I drink or hang out at the bar...I'm a married man...I wouldn't be doing that kind of thing, right?  My kids and wife love Texas Roadhouse.  It's noisy enough to drown out their squeals of laughter or yelps of terror when their siblings attack...not that I let my kids go crazy in public...I'm not \"that\" parent.  No, for real, my kids are great in public and Texas Roadhouse is great in Gilbert.  Go there!  You'll love it!  Oh, and get call ahead seating on the weekends.  You'll thank me for it when you can walk past all the people waiting to get a seat and you get seated in minutes after arriving.  You feel like you should have an entourage or something...."}
{"text":"Wow. Never been to a Texas Roadhouse, and my only regret is that this is a chain--I'd love to be able to tell people we have an awesome steakhouse unique to us.   The food was mouthwatering. One of the few times EVER I've been happy with a restaurant steak over Home grilled ones.   The service was over the top good. People truly appear to love working there (as their shirts say). We were greeted by multiple employees on the way in and the way out. Our waitress was unbelievably polite and she was the correct amount of attentive.   Our only minuscule complaint was that we somehow didn't get the apple butter stuff with our bread--it somehow got left out of the basket. And then they kept forgetting to bring it to us.   Either way, we will be back over and over. Wow  UPDATE:  So, sadly I'm going to take two stars away, but with an explanation. The in-restaurant experience is still amazing, other than the fact they are always packed (can't blame this on them).   So, because of how busy they are, we've twice ordered for carry out. I won't ding them much for the fact the food has been 15-20 minutes late both times, but what I will ding them for is that the doneness of the steaks are AT LEAST 1 level below what we order them at.   I always get the bone-in ribeye, ordered medium rare. Arguably the cut of steak they're most proud of. I'm not exaggerating when I say that this thing looks like they seared it and then took it off the grill. It jiggles like jello. I love to consider myself as someone who likes steaks still mooing, but this is a little too alive even for me. There are lots of pieces that are completely inedible.   My wife always gets filets and orders them, to my eternal shame, Medium Well (it's a running joke). When ordering out, her steak comes home medium rare--at best.   I hate to admit it, but we both end up MICROWAVING our steaks just so we can get through them. Not what I expect for a $60+ meal.   Again, I can't stress enough that this is NOT consistent with the in-restaurant experience. It's just a hunch, but I think they're SO busy that they send things home undercooked because:  1) They won't have to deal with a take-out customer sending their steak back to the kitchen.  2) They would rather undercook than overcook, because you can always do what we do and put it in the microwave/over/grill.  3) They are so damn busy (literally 50 people waiting outside the door on a weeknight) that they are short grill space and prioritize in-restaurant steaks ahead of pick-ups.   I can almost guarantee you that my steaks don't hit the grill until I show up for the pick-up. That would explain the 20 minute wait and the raw steaks.   Still, I have to say, the staff is as courteous and professional as can be. I just know we will never again order takeout there. We will definitely eat at the restaurant every once in a while, but I gotta admit, the pick-up experience has me feeling a little ripped off and less excited about any meal there. They're no longer somewhere I'd feel comfortable with bragging about."}
{"text":"Food was very good. We came here for birthday. Steaks cooked perfectly.  Great Sangria Margarita. Birthday girl sat on a saddle and they sang to her."}
{"text":"I don't go to chain steakhouses expecting a Durant's experience, but usually Texas Roadhouse does a great job and we have had good experiences at their other locations. I don't know what this particular spot is doing though, because our visit was pretty terrible from beginning to end. We called ahead for seating - over an hour wait still. Alright, it's Friday night, it's the holidays, I get it. While we're waiting, someone slaps a sign up on the door that they are completely out of sirloin due to some kind of delivery issue because of weather. Alright, not their fault, they can't control snow. Get seated and no one shows up to our table for 15 minutes. People seated after us are getting their drink orders and we haven't even had someone say a word to us yet. Someone finally shows up and we order. I notice the price of their prime rib has gone up $5+. Tomatoes in my salad are not ripe yet and rock hard. Food arrives and is completely over-salted. Bathroom was a complete mess with toilet paper all over the floor in and out of the stalls and the trash overflowing with dirty paper towels. Order an alcoholic beverage, it never shows up until we ask the server where it is. Apparently it got lost in the system by the bartender, drink shows up 15 minutes later.  Our server was very nice, which was the saving grace of the evening, but this was the first and last time we'll go to this location, even if it is one of the more convenient ones for us. Disappointing and a waste of a date night and money to say the least."}
{"text":"PROS: The food was amaaaaazing! I am always leery of trying new places and really wasn't keen on trying out a steakhouse since I'm more into vegetarian dishes. Still, I had the BBQ chicken (with the BBQ on the side, so really more of a grilled chicken) with mashed potatoes and have been craving it again since I had it! The food was really, really amazing and our waitress was excellent. She was attentive and really did a great job of making sure we were happy--bread was brought out, drinks, orders were taken and she checked up on us several times and was super pleasant. We loved having her as our waitress! : )   CONS: The wait time to get in was pretty lengthy, even with a call ahead reservation. We were seated on really tall chairs because the one other table to large parties was being used by another party. This was more difficult for the oldest and youngest members of the family and would have preferred regular seating. They are only open in the later afternoon so if you're craving it midday, you'll have to wait for a late lunch or early dinner.  All in all, one of my newer fave places to eat at! I wish there was more flexibility in when I can go there--I would go more often if it was open around noon too! The food is excellent!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here after spring training game  today and had an amazing time! We were told seating would be around 20 to 30 minutes, but it only took around 10 minutes.   Our waitress Bri was a sweetheart! Super soft spoken and down to earth. She made sure we were doing fine the whole time :)   The rolls and cinnamon butter were amazing   Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I had a great steak. No need for steak sauce, was cooked to perfection. I would've given 5 stars had they not tried to seat us next to the big family with loud kids. The place was empty, just opened. Yet the booth next to the large table is where they wanted to put us, no way."}
{"text":"I will never understand why this place is always packed? The steaks although lean are never cooked the way you ask them to be. The pulled pork sandwich comes dry (no sauce what so ever). I also think they use more salt then any other eatery I have gone to. You shouldn't have so much salt on the fries that you have to search for signs of potato. I understand people get a kick out of throwing the peanut shells on the floor and all, but it also makes this one of the dirtiest restaurants around. Yes the rolls are flavorful, but tend to be on the hard side. One of my two stars go to their sweet tea. If you pick this place to eat give it a try.   On a side note the wait staff tends to sing Happy Birthday at the top of their lungs every five minutes. Be ready to scream to the person at your table if you want to be heard."}
{"text":"Was greeted with a friendly welcome, we were seated quickly.  Waitress was great, always stopping to see if we needed anything. I had Ribeye and it was cooked just the way I like it. Husband had Strip Steak was good. Their bread buns were Awesome with a yummy butter mixture that melts in your mouth.   We will for sure return."}
{"text":"Had my first meal at Texas Roadhouse Tempe, AZ. The atmosphere was nice, wait staff from the greeter to the waitress were very accommodating.  We all order the Ribeye Steak, cooked to order. I am a medium rare steak eater and my husband is a well done steak eater.  Our steaks as well as our sides were cooked to our liking.  The soft bread they serve when you walk in is delicious!  We will definitely be eating there again!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time yesterday for Sunday dinner. I had been to the Mesa location and enjoyed it and this one is closer to my house.  My daughter and I got the half rack ribs. Mine was so burnt it tasted like a charcoal briquette smothered in bottled barbecue sauce.  The mashed potatoes were congealed Into the shape of a splat where the cook had slopped a spoonful into the dish. I took a bite and got a mouthful of half a raw potato.  My daughter was too mortified to complain about hers (she's 15). Her baked potato was good. We paid an extra dollar for it to be 'loaded' which meant a handful of shredded cheese and some bacon bits.  Even the famous bread tasted like stale reheated King's Hawaiian rolls.   My husband liked his chicken fried steak, he got 'loaded' steak fries, which again was a hand full of shredded cheese all in one spot with some bacon bits. The side salads were the best thing there. Then they still charged me for my dinner until we asked to have it removed and only pay for the salad. (I had returned it after one bite) The manager never came by. So if you like Texas Roadhouse, do yourself a favor and drive to Stapley. Although there is usually a wait, now I know why this location didn't have a wait."}
{"text":"OK food, but you get what you paid for. 18oz Ribeye for $25, I can't  complain but won't be back."}
{"text":"Suzie was a great waitress, however we called and made reservations and still had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table... The buns are ways delicious, not to mention you also get free peanuts. The food is decent and the beers came out quick, good place to go considering the location."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places with decent food at a decent price. They also have an option to call ahead to put on their wait list. This place can get REALLY busy so the option might not be available since no one is available to pick up the phone. Other than that, food is always on point and customer service is always reliable."}
{"text":"Food is great for a casual steak house. They have one of the best ranch salad dressings ever and I never skip that as my side! Tonight me and my mom split the steak medallions and they were tasty. The food is great and the service is fine, but what kept me from making this a 4-star review were the hygienics of the bathroom. I won't go into detail but it's pretty bad."}
{"text":"This is my third chance for this location.    First visit was very disappointing, (1 star) so we waited a couple of months to give them another chance, the food was better but the service was still amiss (2.5 Stars).  This time we seemed to have the same type of disappointment  we used to get at the Pineville Location that closed down over a year ago.  For starters, we were seated toward the back of the restaurant, away from the the main dining area.  This is usually where the worst service occurs because it is out of the line of sight of the servers.  It took approx three minutes prior to a server approaching our table, and taking our drink order.  Since we were under a fan (circulating on high) we requested that the fan be turned off.  The staff quickly obliged, however they turned off the entire fans throughout the whole restaurant. I am not sure that this bothered me, however it may have effected others  as we were the only ones in our section.  I requested a house salad, no tomatoes, no eggs, no onions, with EXTRA cheese, no dressing, and my wife had the same setup with Ranch dressing.  When we received our salads, neither salad had ANY cheese at all.  This was quickly addressed with the server, and she brought out two small cups of cheese (which we were charged $1.00).  We looked at each other with what could be next, as we already started to have a bad experience. We proceeded to enjoy the salad, as it was fresh, and the plates were cold.    Now the steaks come out.  I ordered a 10oz Ribeye (medium), with fries, and my wife had the 6oz sirloin (medium )with a baked potato. My steak was cooked perfectly, the fries were hot and well seasoned.  I was quite happy.  My wife,  on the other hand now that is a different story.  Her steak appeared to be cooked perfectly, however it was well done, with no pink in the middle.  We quickly addressed this to our server and she asked if we would like another steak.  She promptly stated that we jut wanted to end this dining experience, as how hard can it be to cook a steak, if all you serve is steak.  A manager (Gary) promptly came over, we expressed our experience, and our previous disappointments at this location and he was generous enough to comp her meal.  The steak while overdone to her taste (not as ordered and as we like) was shown to the manager in front of the server and both agreed that this was not acceptable.  The explanation we received is that they had a new cook in the last week or so, and they were trying to improve the consistency to this location.   I am all about second chances, but this location fails to be consistent, except in its ability to be inconsistent.   Our server was very friendly, and after we were initially greeted by her, she did everything that she could possibly do.  The food being overcooked was not her fault.  In both cases, food runners brought the food out, and therefore she was unable to notice any problems that she may have been able to correct.  I may be back to this location, but it will be months down the line.  This place is a hit and miss for us, but I must say that the management did step up, admit an error, and comped the meal which was not satisfactory.  NCFoodGuy"}
{"text":"Considering it was crowded was surprised to see how fast we were seated and only had to wait about 15 minutes the steak and ribs were cooked to our liking... yes I would recommend as I have had to wait a lot longer other places which cost a lot more and was not happy with any of the food we ordered.  When i go to a restaurant I expect great service and even better food.(otherwise I will cook better at home)"}
{"text":"Wow, talk about being rushed.  I know you guys are busy and have a long wait... But after waiting 50 minutes to be seated, you think we could be allowed to sit and enjoy our meal for a reasonable amount of time.  We were given our check after taking only a few bites of our entree and our waitress stood waiting, and then asking, to take away our plates when we were still eating from them.  Good food though!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite location to go to. The staff are always kind and the food is always great. I am a huge fan of their road kill that come with a sirloin patty  covered with onions, mushrooms and provolone cheese. It is so delicious!!c with a side of loaded mash potatoes and their signature house salad.   Let's not forgot the star of the show their amazing yeast rolls and cinnamon honey butter. Can we safe AMAZING. I have been coming here for years and will continue."}
{"text":"Love the rolls. However, if you get stuffed on the rolls, you'll miss the savory taste of the main course.  I love ribeye steak, but most restaurants do not know how to properly cook it. At first I was hesitant to order it but was pleasantly surprised. It was prepared and cooked just right to be tender and flavorful. Definitely worth every penny."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what you would expect. Peanuts on the floor, and a fun atmosphere. We personally feel the stakes are a little overpriced for what you get, but not to the point where it should deter you from experiencing this at least once. The food is fairly decent, as you would expect from a chain steakhouse. This is a good fun time out if you want it."}
{"text":"Hubby and I ate here Monday Aug 7th, and I must say, the food & service was phenomenal! Our server Shelley or Melly chell, something like that was awesome. Hubby tipped her so good for her service, she ran out the front door, to say thank you again!! We didn't wait long for drinks, food, or anything. We'll be back"}
{"text":"I really like eating here, but arrive early to avoid the wait. Everything I have eaten here is delicious, especially the steaks. Bluntly this place makes Outback so second rate.  This is a family dining style place, not a high end steak house. Booths are huge, the atmosphere is roomy, country, well lit.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went out to celebrate ordered prime rib with shrimp I ordered my prime rib medium well come out HELLA RARE.  The waiter took it back they brought it back the first piece I cut was HELLA WELL DONE. I cut through the rest of the prime rib and it was all pink still. I told the waiter and he said sorry the cook said it was a weird cut of meat didn't offer to switch it out for a better even cut of meat so I could get what I ordered NOTHING. Just that it is a weird piece WTH! Yea SUCKS! So my celebration dinner wasn't what I expected it to be!"}
{"text":"I hate to sit here and say a chain like this has great steaks, but wow. Texas Roadhouse has impressed me. The steaks for the price (that is cheap AND includes 2 sides) is probably worth 5 stars. I've had the filet and the filet medallions here (see a trend?) and both were great and cooked just like they said they would be. The sides are big which I appreciate. The spiced rice that comes with the filet medallions is enough to convince me to order it again. Not to mention peanuts, a bread basket, three 3 oz medallions, rice, and two sides easily makes two meals out of one $20 entree.  Where they fall short? Crushed up peanuts all over the floor. They're always super busy so it can be hard to flag down your server (not an issue the past time I was here). I didn't care for their chili and would encourage a different side. Lastly it's a popular birthday destination and the \"YEE HAWs\" make me cringe, but hey, maybe that's just because I'm no fun.   If you're looking for a great steak and not looking to break the bank or dress up for a fancy establishment I think you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Me and husband use to be all about sushi and until we stumbled on roadhouse lol and now we can't get enough!! I love the prime rib and my husband loves the New York steak  mash potatoes and gravy is yummy too and my girls love their ribs!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Excellent service and very wonderful staff. The food was wonderful and the prices are comparable to other steak houses. I recommend the 20 OZ. bone in ribeye. Also the beer on tap is ice cold. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Every time we go there we have a great time! It's one of my daughter's favorite places. She gets involved with the dancing and loves the people! The food there is top notch and if for some reason we ever had an issue it has been fixed quickly with the most apologetic manager! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tempe location.  Service was painfully slow waiting 30 minutes to just get a drink.  Food was fine, but several mistakes in the order that they had to keep correcting.  Three hours for dinner at 6pm with a seating call ahead on a Saturday - beware.  My first time there and not worth going back."}

{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant to go to period.. the food is always amazing but I'm writing this review because our waiter tonight was seriously awesome!! I overheard him say his manager wouldn't allow him to pick up anymore tables because he already had so many and even so he was so polite and attentive to us. Never an empty drink or dirty plate on our table.. as soon as our rolls or drinks were gone he brought more without us even asking. Great friendly service.. thank you Anthony :)"}
{"text":"What an upgrade from the roadhouse in tempe. Waitstaff was on point until they forgot to bring out my salad. Ate that with my meal. Other than that we did not have to ask for refills on drinks or hot buns. It was so pleasant. Waitress waited on us just enough. Food cooked perfectly and big ol portions. We will choose this location moving forward"}
{"text":"Customer service here is pretty good. The food is hit or miss.  I've been there a few times and I've only had really good food the one time.  It wasn't burnt and had plenty of toppings. The last time we went they were out of the complimentary buns and we had to wait"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great service, good food at a decent price.  Drinks are huge."}
{"text":"The food was great! The buns are amazing there cant stop at one! The ribs were really good and my husband enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich! We check in using the Yelp app and got a free cactus blossom! Who doesn't love a free appetizer. Overall our experience was great! Definitely would come again and would recommend!"}
{"text":"I have had positive experiences here. The steak is great. The sweet tea is delicious. The sides are always tasty. The service is good. It is expensive, and there is always a long wait to get a table. But if you don't mind spending a little extra time and money, I recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I'll preface this with the fact that I did not eat here, just sat at the bar and had a beer. Drinks were well priced and cold, two of my must haves at a bar. The service was prompt and friendly, although I never knew who my server was exactly as there were 3 people behind the small bar and if you made eye contact they checked on you. My biggest complaint: STALE peanuts. What a huge disappointment. Everyone raves on and on about the peanuts and they were gross. I also have to question how often there are restocked, tossed out, etc. One person not washing their hands after a bathroom break and that whole bucket is done... ewww...."}
{"text":"Service. As always - service is everything.  I ordered my steak \"medium rare\". As I have accent - I made the server repeat and to make sure all clear. The steak arrives \"well done\".   How can one enjoy dinner when everyone else get their food and you are the last one? It's soooooo wrong. Just amazing how any manager allow himself that level of service.  And no - I will not mention refill etc - because it didn't come on time as well but \"who cares\"?"}
{"text":"This place has never disappointed. Service is always great and the food is consistent and delicious. Just went on Sunday and sat in the bar booth since there is only 2 of us. Our server was amazing. I did not catch his name but he was attentive and super helpful. As always we will be back again."}
{"text":"Meh I've experienced better.   I've done the trifecta of steak restaurants at Metro Center. Texas Roadhouse was better than Black Angus, but I don't plan to go back.   I had the steak and ribs combo with a sweet potato and caeser salad. Service was friendly but a little slow.  The salad was ok, but drenched in dressing. The baked sweet potato was excellent.   The steak was ordered medium rare. It arrived that way, but the meat wasn't flavorful. It wasn't overcooked, but it still tasted bland. The ribs were better. Not amazing but pretty good.   Overall, it wasn't a bad meal, but I'm not in a rush to return. The atmosphere is loud with birthday party songs etc."}
{"text":"Great service! If it's your birthday, definitely let them know... you get to sit on the mighty saddle! Our waitress was really patient with us since my husband and I recently started eating Keto... we had a lot of requests and changes to our dish. Love this location and you can never go wrong with Texas Roadhouse!"}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is one of those places that has never disappointed me.  I have been to two separate locations, the one in Stow and the one in Newark Ohio, and the quality of service and food have stayed consistent.    I never knew how much I enjoyed watching the kitchen staff take the steaks off the display counter straight to the grill.  The sound of that sizzle is making my mouth salivate as I write this.  The meat is fresh and is cooked to whatever temperature you please.    As for me, I order the 8 oz sirloin medium.  I like my steaks a little on the softer side hence the level of doneness I choose.  The last time I visited my two sides were grilled shrimp and buttered corn. The shrimp were nicely seasoned and had a pleasant texture as opposed to rubbery, overcooked shrimp.  The rest of my family members were very pleased with their meals.  They were from out of town and don't have a Texas Roadhouse in their area.  After this meal, they wanted to come back.  As long as their food stays tasty and fresh and the service is pleasant I will stay a loyal customer to Texas Roadhouse whether it be in Stow or Newark Ohio."}
{"text":"The place its really nice they have different tvs so won't miss the game they take a little while to get your food ready but the appetizers are really rich"}
{"text":"My kids love Texas Roadhouse.  We don't have them close, so when we are on a trip, they (the kids) always want to find one of these chain restaurants.   Stopped with a friend and 5 kids.  At the end of a camping trip, so I just wanted good food that I didn't have to prepare.   This was a great choice.  Kids loved the bread.  They loved the peanuts. We ordered the onion blossom, perfect.    Overall, the food was OK.  Cost is a little high.  They were busy, so the apps and food took some time.   The service was OUTSTANDING.  The waitress kept the bread and drinks coming.   One diner did not like the quality of her pulled pork.  The manager came over immediately, and rectified the situation.  Bravo.    I'd go back if I had the kids with me."}
{"text":"At first this place has a lot of potential. Free peanuts and all, like an upscale five guys. But then the sauce on our order got mixed up. I ordered the sweet and zesty sauce to go with my burger, but that sauce ended up at another person's burger. Then the well sought after(though i have never tried until now) steak fries were soo salty i could not consume more than 2. The smokehouse burger was equally as salty. I love mushrooms but these sautee mushrooms were drenched in salt. Even the burger buns were salty. The meat on my burger lacks flavor.   The best part of the dish were the free rolls. Consume them right when they come out, if you wait, they are not as good. Sweet soft and buttery.  Major stomach ache and food poisoning the night after my meal. Oh gosh, never again. Was it because I had my burger medium? But why present it as an option if it would not be safe to consume? I was sick for 1.5 weeks. Never have I had such a bad food poisoning experience. That night my stomach started to cramp, then I could not hold any food or liquid down the next morning. I had fever and chills and diarrhea."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today, overall it seems clean, until you unwrap your silverware just to find everything is dirty and greasy inside and your server says that she's told management a few times and apparently nobody's listening..... We had to ask for sugar caddies as there was no sugar packets on the table, we have been here for 45 minutes and we have  not seen a manager walked the floor or touch tables, it's just servers managing the floor; such a sad sad situation at this location that the management team doesn't care about their location at 12 o'clock in the afternoon"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here as always!  Tonight even more so than usual because of the 'Touch a Truck' event that was going on.  The restaurant really did a nice job lining up a lot of trucks and participation for the event. My son was in heaven.  Thanks to all of the community supporters that were out there. It was great.  Our meal was perfect and our server was outstanding.  A wonderful visit and a fun night out.  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place - steaks are outstanding, baked potatoes are always hot and steamy.  Wait staff are friendly, attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth filet steak medallions, delicious. I think they are heavily marinated as they need no seasoning at all. Comes with a tasty but salty seasoned rice. Mushrooms were salty too. Veggies were lightly cooked which I like. Very noisy room, couldn't make conversation easily. Felt a little rushed. The meal was all good. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"For the money spent Texas Roadhouse is a great deal. Unlimited hot buns with cinnamon butter, and stadium style roasted peanuts.  If you are having a steak I highly recommend you hand pick your own steak from the case to get one you prefer. The steaks range from lean to pretty fatty on the same cuts of meat. Whatever you do let your steak rest because they do not pre rest them before bringing  them to the table. For those who need to know resting allows the steak to redistribute the juices uniformly throughout the steak after cooking. That is the basic and easiest way to explain it for the average viewer.  The appetizers are pretty darn good. I love the steak fries. The bake potatoes I recommend asking for either a large one or small one to your preference.  The TX Roadhouse steak sauce in my opinion doesn't have much flavor and is fairly bitter. Ask for the A1.  Overall the easiest way to describe this TX Roadhouse location is very consistent in their cooking style. We have been here quite a few times and always the same results."}
{"text":"The ribeye here is always cooked perfectly and rivals many nice steakhouses.  Try it with blue cheese crumbles. By the way it's 8.99 and comes with a house salad and fries or a baked potato.... Incredible deal for how good this is"}
{"text":"Hello,  My message unreplied from last night on their message us tab here on yelp:  Really wanted steak tonight and since you're only steakhouse here we popped in.  Great service, steak great but the sides were all hideous: liquid smoke green beans, mashed potatoes (daughter who loves mashed wouldn't eat them and said tasted like sugar in them), freezer burnt broccoli/carrots and over cooked nasty sauces mushrooms.  Thanks, Eric"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. Great service and great food at a good price. I especially like the \"roadkill\", hamburger steak and steak fries. Fried catfish is also great. My wife had a filet that was cooked perfectly and was tender and delicious. I enjoyed the rolls and peanuts as well. They seem to do everything right. Be aware is noisy though."}
{"text":"I have now visited 2 Texas Roadhouse locations!  You know it's good when they both come in with 5 stars each.  I visited the Oceanside,CA location and the Scottsdale, AZ location.  Great service with a real smiles and great attitudes at both locations!  The bread is incredible!  Ask for plain butter and save the cinnamon butter to use on rolls for dessert! YUM! Sirloin steak seems more like NY Steak, excellent!  You can't beat the food and reasonable prices.  Go hungry, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We came here after a movie since it is conveniently located across the parking lot from the theater. There was a bit of a wait to be seated (to be expected on a Saturday night), but it was only about 20 minutes for a party of two. Our server, Lexie, seemed to genuinely enjoy her job and engaging with the parties at her tables. She never once came across as just being there to collect a paycheck. We've all had those servers, and while they are pleasant and efficient and do their job, there is just a little spark lacking. Not with Lexie - she was bright, cheerful, and even asked about my new handbag. Our food came out in a timely manner and exactly as we had asked it to be prepared. It was delicious! As we were leaving, other employees thanked us for coming and wished us a pleasant evening/weekend. All in all, the service and food were excellent and I will definitely be returning to this location!"}
{"text":"I'm am in town for a Convention. I am staying not to far from the restaurant. I had take out 2 nights. The take out girl (forgot her name) was great!! She even remembered what I ordered the first night! Food was prepared well, ready in 20 min! They are so friendly too!!"}
{"text":"Was there for my husbands Birthday celebration on Dec 26.  The place was busy but we got seated right away.  Food was good as always.  This has been one of our favorite places for some time.  But on this visit the place was filthy!  I mean I am fine with the peanuts on the floor but they seated guests at tables with food, paper and garbage underneath them.  A napkin was tossed on the floor by previous guests and never picked up....ruined dinner."}
{"text":"Somehow I missed adding a review. Texas Roadhouse never disappoints! We are always seated right away or within a few minutes. Employees are always friendly and the atmosphere is great. When I'm craving steak this is the first place I think of. Always cooked perfectly and appetizers are always on point. Last time we went I was even talked into the fried pickles and they were actually so good. I love pickles, but the last fried pickles I tried I wasn't impressed at another restaurant. Salads are huge and fresh. My kids love the ribs and could probably sit there all day eating and eating. Prices are great for how big the portions are. Do yourself a favor and check them out!"}
{"text":"I understand that things happen sometimes and restaurants don't always run smoothly but too many things went wrong tonight for it to be a fluke. We had a large party and called ahead to get a table we still arrived half an hour early at 5:30 our reservation was at 6 after complaining about not having our table yet the staff scrambled to get one ready and we were finally seated just before 7. We sat down and ordered and everything was fine until we got our food, I ordered my steak medium rare and what I got was cooked rare, my cousin also ordered a steak medium well, his was cooked medium rare when he brought it up to the waiter the waiter argued with him telling him it was medium well. Two of our partied orders were \"lost\" so they had to be completed remade those two people in my party did not receive their food until about half an hour after the rest of us. The whole ordeal was a Nightmare, I would not recommend this location to anyone! If you are in the area their are plenty of other options but if you really want to eat here I recommend you go to a different location even if you need to drive out of your way"}
{"text":"I usually start out restaurants with a two star rating and go from there. Texas Roadhouse is one of the MANY chain restaurants in Champaign that I have noticed and tonight after a PBL Basketball game, I decided to head on over!   The best thing about this place is the cinnamon sugar butter. Three words obese people love. In my fat days, I focused on the sugar. In my not fat days, I focus on the cinnamon and butter. Butter isn't bad. Neither is cinnamon, and sugar...not too much. Again, eating too much fat doesn't make you fat...eating too much of ANYTHING DOES! This is why I started the meal with my cup of chili and waited to have the aforementioned bread and butter for dessert and not to load up before! Kudos to me right!?  I ordered the HAND CUT (as opposed to robotic arm cut) sirloin steak (8 oz) with a cup of chili (very good...beans...I mean, come on, it is TEXAS ((roadhouse)), sauteed mushrooms, and some extra vegetables. I ordered it medium and it came out medium! You can't overcook a chain steak...and they didn't! I am not a HUGE steak guy, mostly because it is so expensive but I would put this on par with Chili's and Outback Steakhouse. Again, if you want a real steak meal, you will have to go to Ruth Chris', Morton's, Gibson's, Sullivan's, or Joe's Prime Seafood and Steak.   Again, service was good. It was a Friday night so it was pretty busy. Total bill wasn't too much...I ended up paying $25, so not bad!!! It's probably with all my add ons that the total piled up! The last and only other time I was here was after my brother graduated from NIU. I was at the Naperville location! I'd take this one over that one just due to Naperville being too snooty for me...hahah!  I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but I wouldn't avoid it."}
{"text":"Nice chain with yummy steaks and delicious cocktails.  I wish I had room to finish my steak though!  I filled up on the barrels of peanuts they have throughout the place.  We waited about 15min to be seated on a hopping Saturday night, so I had plenty of time to gorge on these delicious peanuts.  We also watched as a cute little kid enjoyed the shell-covered floor.  He was making sure each shell was turned into dust by stomping each one.  Such entertainment! Then of course they have a metal bucket full of these addictive peanuts at each table!! Shame on them!! I almost asked our waiting to take them away from me! lol  Good food, nice atmosphere, and decent prices.  Would go here again when visiting family."}
{"text":"Went around 530 and their was no wait me and my family of 4 sat right down and ate an amazing meal. Food was great and affordable and drinks were great too. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"First things first their bread!!! It's A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! I always get the sirloin steak with a side of chili and mashed potatoes, it never fails me... so delicious."}
{"text":"Love it! I always get ribeye rare! Make sure you do the call ahead seating so you can get seated quickly-trust me!"}
{"text":"Had great food and service. Shelly Mac was our waitress and did AWESOME! She was very attentive. Even though the Prime Rib was out she was more than willing to make up for it. She suggested a Ribeye that was great!  It was refreshing to see someone who is interested in providing service!"}
{"text":"Horrible cooks. Can't cook a steak to save their lives. Ask for medium and get extremely medium rare. Which is more closer to rare. Won't be back"}
{"text":"I had just moved to Arizona a few months ago and have been to this Texas Roadhouse quite a few times. Excellent food, really great prices. Honestly, I'm surprised they weren't more expensive. Their prices are similar to Applebee's but with better quality food. Only once was the service slow but you could tell they were short staffed because this guy was running all over his section he was charge of. Gave him a good tip because I felt so bad for him.  The bread rolls and butter they give you to start with.. ugh. Do not eat those delicious things if you're not starving. The first time, I was already full by the time my dinner plate arrived.  As far as the wait goes, I've only had to wait up twenty minutes at most. Call ahead and the wait will be less when you arrive."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant several times in Lumberton NC. This is the first time I went to the restaurant in Concord NC. Had the oven roasted chicken. Not the best ever but it was pretty good. The kids enjoyed it too."}
{"text":"Awesome. Great selections of food. I ordered a sirloin steak and shrimp with sweet potatoes and vegetables. Fat boy gotta eat!!! I also ordered a hurricane margarita. That was good but I could've had a couple of them so I only got one."}
{"text":"Ate here a few years ago, back when I lived in Chandler.  The only thing I recall raving about were the rolls!  Oohhhhh...  Now, if only TR served sweet potato fries, I'd be racing my way there for a good carb-loading!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to our meal.  I ordered ribs and chicken tenders. A baked potatoe and chili for the sides.  Tried a rib.. cold. Tried potatoe.... warm.  Chili did not melt the cheese.  I never complain. I did this time.  Everything was cold. Bad experience.  I the rolls were hot and fresh and good.    Manager came over offered to order new meal... I just did not want to wait.   Next time......."}
{"text":"Steak was absolutely disgusting. Had the prime rib and no words can describe how horid it tasted. Never received the bread they give each table when you are seated. I really like a Texas Roadhouse and never had issues with them in the past. The only good thing about tonight's visit was the service."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and really good food! I got the BBQ chicken and my boyfriend got the 8oz steak. I tried his and it was done really well. I'm not normally a steak person, but it was delicious. The chicken was also cooked very well and the BBQ sauce it was smothered in made it even better. Really impressed by this food.  The menu seemed to have really great options all around and the free bucket of peanuts at the table was nice to snack on! I would definitely recommend this place to someone and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with this place. I love the ambience and the service is pretty good. However the food is hit or miss for me I've been here a total of five times and on two of those occasions my steak was cooked properly. It's very frustrating because new go to a steakhouse and order a steak a specific way you expected to come out in the way you ordered it. I ordered a steak twice medium rare and one time it came out nearly raw, and when I mean rawI mean almost on cooked in the second time my steak him out closer to medium well or well. I come back here because my family when they travel and likes this place. But I wonder how much longer will keep going there if they continue to make these mistakes"}
{"text":"This place I think is the best place to get the best ribs in town; the meat is flavorful and falls right off the bone! They also have an awesome Pulled Pork Sandwich as well. The service and the atmosphere are both fun and energetic. The only downside for early birds and Sunday dates is that the restaurant is typically only open for dinner and when it is open it is generally always pretty busy so make sure you make a reservation! Bonus points for the awesome cheese fries appetizer!"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant and can't wait to go back again. It is a very long drive from our town, but well worth the time spent getting there. Some of the best food we have eaten.  I had the 12 oz ribeye steak, with a loaded baked potato and a caesar salad on the side. The steak was perfectly done (I ordered it medium rare), very nicely seasoned (did NOT need any steak sauce) and nice and pink inside. The flavor was amazing. The potato was perfectly done and I had ordred it loaded, which is optional (sour cream, cheese and bacon bits) which made it almost a meal in itself.    ordered the rack of ribs. Falling off the bone tender. He does like them saucy, so he had them bring some extra sauce,which they were very happy to do. He had a baked sweet potato with butter, and baked beans. The baked sweet potato was butter soft, it was very good with just butter. And the baked beans were smoky tasting and had just a little kick, without being overly spicy.   Both of us had more than we could eat, and were able to take home our leftovers and had them for lunch the next day!   We split a baby cactus blossom onion appetizer, and it was a lot for two people. The people next to us got the regular sized one and it took up an entire large dinner plate! Very very good and the sauce served with it is to die for.   I love iced tea, and they make it just like I was used to when I lived down South. I usually do not drink sweet tea, but here I did. The sweet tea was so good!   The only thing we didn't care for is the amount of noise in the restaurant, but that was a small thing. Sometimes though it was hard to hear what we were saying to each other. The servers were wonderful, and the manager went table to table, making sure everything was okay with the guests. They put a high priority on customer service.  If you have a peanut allergy, this is a place to avoid. They have tins full of roasted in the shell peanuts on the tables, and there are peanut hulls on the floor in the waiting area (and this place is busy in the evenings, so you would probably have to wait). There is bound to be peanut dust in the air...so this would not be a good place for a person with that kind of allergy to visit."}
{"text":"My best friend and I came here to celebrate my 4.0 semester in college. We were seated right away for a busy night. The waitress was nice and always checked on us. She was pregnant and was running around to all her tables checking on everyone. Very impressed with her being able to keep up on her tables. We ordered our food. We got a sample platter and steaks and salads. My steak was medium well and my friends was medium rare. Both steaks came out on point and were thick and juicy. I got steak fries with mine and she got a baked potato. Her potato was huge! The sampler had jalapeño bites (snake bites I think they're called), fried pickles instead of potato skins and boneless wings. Everything was great, not over cooked and on point. The table was cleaned and so were the booth seats. Fluffy people friendly as well. I would definitely come back to this locations again!"}
{"text":"Best ribs I have had in a long time.  I came here for Father's Day (Monday after to stay away from crowds) but this place was busy anyway.  I like that they do call ahead seating but it wasn't necessary when I showed up at 530....had I got there at 630 I would have needed to.  I always dream of their hot bread with honey butter (or maybe cinnamon butter), anyway it  is ridiculously good, hot and soft.  The place is very loud with music and the place is very casual.  I really enjoyed it and the service was fair.  I will most definitely come back since I am not addicted to the ribs and the bread."}
{"text":"Steak was perfect. Tons of food and we love those rolls! The waiter was always there refilling and then dancing- Fun place to go and I can always count on my order being right and Delish!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Texas Roadhouse locations I've ever been too. The place is always clean and everyone is very pleasant. Only had a minor issue once and the manger (Janelle I think was her name) was very accommodating and pleasant. Always a great place to come and visit.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"If you specialize in steaks, cooking one medium well shouldn't be difficult. After sending it back twice and being cut four times it was dead. Having the manager take it off the bill doesn't fix the dining experience."}
{"text":"big portion, enthusiastic service, not bad but not really my type of restaurant, gotta be really top notch barbecue for me to frequent a place, i go with family when they need it and have a salad which is always fresh and delish."}
{"text":"Your basic chain, sit down restaurant.  Now you will get filling food and the bread isn't that bad but it's not my favorite place on Earth.  It's convenient to the Concord Mills outlets so it does have that going for it but it was packed and crowded when we went and it seems we managed to beat the rush when we had our lunch.  I was just along for the ride so it was okay.  Not the best experience I've had but definitely not the worst experience either."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner steak & shrimp was perfect! The waiter best ever Derek was the best ! We will be deff be back !"}
{"text":"Took the family here for a nice lunch. I ordered the ribs thinking they were award winning. My ribs were over cooked and very dry. They had an odd flavor to them as well. I noticed there was no smoke ring like traditional Texas cooking. The waitress said they were oven roasted for 8 hours then grilled before being served. I don't know about anyone else, but ribs do not take 8 hours to cook. \"Spare\" yourself some grief and order a steak.   We were seated at a table and the waitress had us pass the food to the appropriate person. Odd service at best. Generally good food, but I think they're compromising in the wrong places."}
{"text":"was in town visiting and we decided to go here since it wasnt too far from our hotel.  I think I got the 12 oz ribeye with the loaded baked potato and a ceasar salad.  The steak was seriously one of the best steaks Ive had.  It melted in my mouth.  I felt like I was at a high end steak house...minus the bucket of peanuts on the table and the servers randomly yelling Hee Haw lol.  It was fun!!! The warm rolls with the cinnamon butter was also a treat!!! If I lived in Phoenix, that would be a regular go to place for sure!"}
{"text":"Very good food, service was ok. Waitor good have been a little more pleasant. Clean place."}
{"text":"The steaks and sweet tea are always very good.  I'm not too crazy about the country music or spontaneous line dancing but that's the kind of place it is so it's not fair to rate them on that stuff. :)"}
{"text":"This place is a fun place to eat we've always had good service good food their special starting at 4 o'clock in the afternoon is an excellent price and that's when we usually try to get in there they're busy and they're having lots of fun again the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Very good food. I love going here no matter how many times I've been before. The rolls are my favorite."}
{"text":"I regret my steak choice.  They didn't do very well on my ribeye.  20oz of regret on a bone.  There are other issues such as not having shot glasses (saddest Irish car bomb ever) but they don't matter when a steak place doesn't master steak.  Why is my review so harsh?  Wifey got a 20oz off the bone cut (not on the menu but was hand cut that day) and her steak was so much better.  This shouldn't happen.  My steak was cooked on the border of send it back or just shut up and eat it.  The flavor was lacking - more butter or salt when you cook it.  The color was off, didn't have nice hash grill marks (all the other steaks at the table did).  Longhorn Steakhouse has shown they can do this steak better than Texas Roadhouse.  I went to Texas Roadhouse to try it out before my Uncle visits, since his wife likes it the best of the steak chains.  Unfortunately my Aunt loves to ruin steak, she wants it so dry that it is dark brown in the center and almost completely black on the outside.  You know who else loves to ruin steak?  Texas Roadhouse.  I spent over $100 on my meal there, had it just been my wife and I then I would have given them what for when I was there.  She would have been mortified and stabbed me with a steak knife if I did it in front of our friend.  I also don't want to get my food molested by angry staff because I don't trust them once I send something back.  This is the second time I have gone to a steakhouse in Charlotte and had an awful time.  Unlike last time I didn't sit there and take pictures of everything.  I apologize for my lack of empirical evidence to backup my review - you will have to take my word for it."}
{"text":"Came for a family outing on a birthday. Ordered a bacon cheese burger and it was awful. All dry and the hamburger just crumbled all over the place. The fries were also left over from lunch all nasty not fresh at all."}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is good quality and the prices are good! Service is amazing if you happen to get Melissa!! The management is also very on point! We will always come back this place again and again"}
{"text":"Awesome it's fantastic  friendly staff  best steaks ever I recommend this place for special occasions,every week and more I would definitely go to this place again I mean seriously why not it's fantastic me,my dad,my aunt,my cousin where just there it's awesome who doesn't want steaks great prices too."}
{"text":"I haven't got a chance to eat yet, but when you see such a mess on a flor just when you enter, you start to wonder if you want to eat here at all"}
{"text":"The food was good but not great service. Our server came back twice to ask our drink order because she kept forgetting. I think it is great for the servers who have great memories but it will ALWAYS make me nervous when they dont write things down."}
{"text":"Went back again since the last time I was there the steak was so good. We were seated as we walked in the door, asked if we had been there before and since this was the newest of several visits, I thought I knew what I was expecting that is until we ordered drinks.   We both ordered a beer and were promptly asked for our ID. Now I have no hair on my head (not by choice) and look a ton older than 21 (I'm 34). I didn't have my id with me. The waitress said let me go check with my manager. After a minute or so the manager comes over and informs us she cannot serve me alcohol because I have no id. I told her about the money she would be losing tonite since I am obviously older than 21 at which point she said \"this is the sound of my heart breaking\" in the most you've mistaken me for someone who cares attitude.  What the sound actually was, was the sound of money leaving her restaurant and never returning. Had she simply explained why they couldn't, no problem. No need to be condescending about it. Due to her attitude, we left and found someplace else to eat and will never be back to the Texas roadhouse."}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazing but we tried take out a couple weeks ago. My husband had an issue with his salad and when I called Lauren was all over it. She really went above and beyond and made up for the issue."}
{"text":"Great flavorful food and great service! Always on point! Will recommend to others! Always seated immediately! Complementary bread and peanuts upon arrival. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"I'm totally disappointed. I spent $100.00 and nobody finished their dinner.  First, my mother-in-law like rare beef. Well, they served it raw. So she sends it back and it comes back after we have finished eating and it's now over cooked. I understand it is difficult to cook a stake rare but they are charging $15 for this stake and after all it is a stake house. She didn't finish her dinner. Second my wife orders a stake as well. She doesn't like pink in her meet (yes she is weird) she orders medium well. Again it's under cooked it's bleeding this is a problem as she is turned off at the sight. She doesn't finish her dinner.   Third  my daughter orders chicken strips and fries. I can't tell you what they served her. She said it looked like tongue. She didn't finish her dinner. Fourth I ordered a full rack of ribs. The meat was so dry I had a hard time eating it. I forced down half and I couldn't eat any more.  So, I paid $100 for bad food and good service. I got to say the staff was great but the food was terrible."}
{"text":"Recently went to Texas road house for Valentine's Day with my girlfriend and our children, we had to wait for about 30 minutes to get a table I tried making reservations prior but was unable to due to their first come first serve system... Well upon getting our table our server was very friendly. And after looking through their menu they had very few selections of dinners to chose from. My family and ordered their sampler starter which was delicious it had snake bites, chicken wings and potato wedges covered in cheese and bacon. I then ordered myself a ribeye with a side of cole slaw, mash potatoes and I had to special order Mac and cheese which I found odd for a steak house.. Most steak house have Mac and cheese normally. Well I got my plate my steak and 2 sides were delicious but my Mac and cheese looked and tasted like Kraft Mac and cheese I wasn't to pleased with that.. Overall my food was pretty delicious the waiter was friendly and checked on us periodically and gave us pretty fast service. The environment was very loud and crowded. So For two plates and one child plate our bill came out to $70.00 not including a tip. Upon exiting Texas Roadhouse a homeless person was waiting at the sidewalk and approached me and my family and begged me for our food which was very sad but killed the what was romantic evening.. Not one of the best steak houses I've ever been to and I don't think I will be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I am not terribly superstitious but where I come from ( I think this is a thing within the black culture) it is bad luck to throw peanuts shells on the floor so when I walked in and saw shells basically covering the entire floor, I immediately got erie.   Minus that, services and food was decent. I had the steak skewers. Steak was tender as were the veggies. I am not a huge fan of their dinner rolls however. They were too sweet for me and the butter seemed to have cinnamon which I don't like.   TX Roadhouse is an \"A-OK\" place if you want a quick steak, but if I am comparing it with other steaks I've eaten, I definitely have experienced much better."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience at this Texas Roadhouse! Our server, Justine, was awesome. She was extremely friendly and a great server. My steak was juicy and very tender."}
{"text":"Not many good things to say.   My. Steak tasted like a bottle of liquid smoke was injected into it   The bowl of loaded potatoes was literally hard as a rock.  I guess that happens when it sits under a heat lamp too long.  Salads came out after dinner was served Then there was the feeling that we were being rushed though dinner because they had to turn the table for the next group  The only good thing was the ability to phone in ahead of time to go on the wait list."}
{"text":"Always good. Texas Roadhouse is always my go-to restaurant when I'm craving a juicy steak. Never disappoints and the apple butter it just the icing on the cake. Beers are always cold and a great family environment!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, very friendly. Steaks are good for a value & without the need to dress up. Mix drinks are very good. Not much to complain about - used to be busy all the time with long lines but lately it seems they've figured out how to move people through quicker."}
{"text":"I don't see the big deal about this place, I really don't.  I frequently go to the Zx Gym multiple times a week, and every time I pass this restaurant the parking lot is crazy full. The last time we visited, it was extremely crowded, messy with peanuts everywhere, and the waitress was rude.  The food hasn't been disappointing though. I love their bread and butter."}
{"text":"Knowing we had a big party of 8-10 people I called ahead at 3;30p for a 6p dinner.  Upon arrival I checked in to get the buzzer because 3 of us had already arrived. Was told we couldnt be seated until the entire party had arrived. 615 rolls around and everyone is there so I informed them everyone was there. Was told the table they were waiting for was just about wrapping up so we would have to wait. We continued to wait and decided to go to the bar to grab a drink while we waited. Except it was dancing time so they refused to serve us anything at the bar because it was \"dancing\" time. At this point its now 10 til 7 and once I asked the speak to the manager our buzzer decides to go off conveniently. Even though we had been sitting by the front door the whole time and saw no parties leave to free the table we were \"waiting\" on. Absolutely worst experience ever. Will never be returning and recommend nobody else go there and get similar treatment. I can only imagine how bad the service would have been,once we were seated! What a shame I've always loved Texas Roadhouse they bring shame to the brand!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had been painting our house all day when we decided to treat ourselves to a steak dinner. We opted for take out seeing as how we were covered in paint and looked rather grungy. We had the 16 oz ribeye ( I think!?) but it was the best damn take out we have ever had. They included the rolls, the yummy butter, everything was awesome. Usually take out isn't as good, but not here at the Texas Roadhouse, it rocks!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Came here for a linner with my cousin, not my usually side of town but I was in the area. Staff very friendly. Our waitress Molly kept our drinks filled, kept checking in on us she was great. I ordered the sirloin medium and it was perfectly cooked. Everything was great!! I did visit the bathroom and it needed attention not quite clean, my only complaint"}
{"text":"Never been to this location and we were so disappointed.. The wait was 40 minutes which honestly was no biggie it was a Friday night. The issue was when we were seated, we were not given bread they said it's in the oven.. Ok again no biggie. It took awhile before we got our drinks, They took our order dropped off our salads and we weren't given silverware we had to flag someone down to get some... And still no bread... We flagged someone down yet again for bread... They brought our food dropped it off and here we were flagging someone down yet again for refills. I know it was busy but our waitress really wasn't doing such a good job she was to busy dancing which yet again I get its part of the atmosphere, but when your paying $17+ plate your service should be on point.  We had to ask for boxes and a bag, waited forever for our bill... It just wasn't that great of service."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night. For a chain steakhouse it is not bad. We both ordered the house salad which was on par with any other salad you would receive and bottled dressing to go with it.. My fiance ordered the filet and i had the ribeye. Both steaks were cooked welll. The green beans i got were a bit weak and could tell they were made earlier in the day and not prepared fresh. I also had the baked potato which was good and had a heap of butter in it when they brought it out... If in the area again and wanting steak we will probably be back."}
{"text":"Visitor from California:) we loved our experience. Girls come out every 30 min to dance a country song lol food was good and the wait wasn't too bad since the restaurant had a huge barrel of peanuts for us at the waiting area :) it kept us occupied . U throw Ur peanut trash in the floor , kind of like Hero's restaurant  (in California) friendly staff . Over all a good experience:)"}
{"text":"Huge shout out to Texas Roadhouse grill. Meghan Payan was awesome love the service she gave. Baked  potatoe was awesome steak was to die for some of the best steak ever cooked perfectly  so well season MY GOD!  Our waitress was so knowledge of the product. She told us the beef company's name and how the stores receive it. Once it is in the cutting and tenderize happens of premises. the high attention to quality sets this chain restaurant apart."}
{"text":"I can't compare this location to any other Texas Roadhouse, but this is my boyfriend and my go to weekend dinner spot right now. I've ate at many fancy steak houses--some that were phenomenal and others just *meh*--but there is just absolutely nothing wrong with this place and it's much more relaxed and affordable. We like to sit at the bar and the service is great. My filet has been cooked perfectly every time and thus far they have never been out of my boyfriend's prime rib. The loaded baked potato and the sangria margarita swirl are both so delicious here. I've never had a bad experience here, very consistent food and service.  Not losing a star because I'm not petty and I think a big part of the problem is due to bad customers, but the women's bathroom is really, really bad. It's always wet and in need of cleaning. The last time I was here I had to turn the sink off after a customer just up and left with the water running."}
{"text":"Good food, fast service, and friendly staff. I always get the ribs and my husband gets the steak."}
{"text":"what is great about Texas roadhouse is there steaks are not frozen before they are cooked which makes it much easier for the cook to make it how you want it, not to mention when you first walk in they have different steaks out on display so you can pick exactly which one you want.. not to mention they also use a grill be a flat top.. how many times has your steak been garbage from outback or longhorns? it's because they are frozen and cooked on a flat top.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped after we had been on the road from California. We entered in a daze and tired from the drive at about 9:45pm when they close at 11pm. We stood there patiently while two employees chatted at the counter together. Another employee passed us and went out the front door. Still the women at the computer wouldn't acknowledge us. I was about to ask if we could sit at the bar and my boyfriend said \"go ahead and go to the bathroom I'll get us a table.\" I came out of the bathroom a few minutes later and still no one would acknowledge us. My boyfriend said he felt uncomfortable so we left.   I understand if you don't want to serve someone because it's pretty empty and you're closing. So why not just greet us and lie? Say thanks for coming but we close at 10? Or say you're welcome to sit at the bar? The ignoring thing from several different employees while we stood arm's length apart at the hostess stand was pretty harsh.   This occurred on Thursday April 13, I was going to report to manager- I have run businesses and would definitely want to know if my employees acted this way, but honestly with a look at the dirty shirts and angry looks on the faces of the employees, I think this is the least of the restaurant's worries. There is obviously very low morale going on at this establishment, looks like the negative employees need to be plucked out and replaced: they're affecting the whole team."}
{"text":"Man that bread is SO good. I can eat a few baskets of it with the butter they offer. That's where the excitement ends though. I order a hamburger here and usually it is decent but nothing special. The staff is usually friendly but this place is pretty average to me. The prices are in line with similar places such as Chilis and Applebee's. I will still come here, but it's never really a memorable experience."}
{"text":"I thought I would treat myself to food that didn't come from a drive thru window tonight, so I drove a little further for dinner this evening. I have been to Texas Roadhouse multiple times - I love the rolls and the sweet tea. The first thing that was interesting tonight was the pager - they called it a pager, but it wasn't the typical pager device restaurants use - it was a piece of printed receipt paper with a number on it...did the recession kill pagers? Even more interesting was that they gave us a \"pager\" even though there was one couple in front of us and the wait was about 2 minutes.   The bread came out and was hot and excellent as always. The waitress was a bit overly perky - like Spartan Cheerleader perky. Maybe I am getting older, but the place was loud - I could barely hear from friend talking to me. The tea was definitely past-peak; the first glass was better than the second.   My friend ordered the roasted chicken and was pleased with the meal. I went with the sirloin and ordered it medium. The waitress brought the meals and I started on the sides, so when she asked how it was, it was fine. When I got to the steak it was well done - no pink, dry and chewy. Now the waitress wasn't to be found. When she finally returned she asked how it was and I let her know it was too well done. She did offer a new one, but I had things to get to, so I declined. She did take it off the bill.   The atmosphere was a negative for being loud, the steak was a negative for being miscooked. Although overly spunky, the service was good and she did offer to correct the food. i left her a descent tip, but left unpleased.   Dinner ended up coming from a drive thru window afterall as I hit up Wendy's on the way out (and it was overcooked too) :-("}
{"text":"Service is always great just don't order a steak because the cooks have no clue what medium rare is."}
{"text":"Tasteless food. Screaming kids. Undercooked steak-twice (ordered well done, got about medium rare, asked for it to be cooked more, still medium rare). Don't eat here."}
{"text":"VERY FRIENDLY staff.  In fact, at times they seemed to be just a bit too friendly.  I get that they train their employee's to greet every guest, but everytime you see an employee, or make eye contact, they are either welcomeing you to the place, or asking how everything is going.  It was a bit of an overkill.  And the place is loud. Very Loud.  So loud it is hard to hear your table companions.  And every so often, the music would go up a little louder, and all the employees would stop making sure every single customer felt welcome and aprreciated all the time, and they all did a cute little line dance.Other than that, the place is great.  Nice atmosphere, great peanuts.  The food is reasonably priced and so very tasty.  I am sure they know this, because they are constantly asking how your meal is.  Well, not constantly, but pretty darn close.  I had the T-Bone smothered in Mushrooms, and it was cooked to perfection.  The rice side dish was a little sticky and over-cooked, but other than that, the food was an 9 out of ten.    After we paid the bill and started to the door, again the service was overwhelming when no less than four seperate employess thanked us for coming and hoped we enjoyed our meal.  The place was packed, but still seemed a little over staffed.  I do like to feel welcome in a resturant, but not every time I turn around.  Still, I think I will be returning for a good, resonably priced meal."}
{"text":"Was in town visiting a friend and we came here. Texas Roadhouse is one of my favorite places.   This one was pretty good. The food was good and although there was a half an hour wait, we really didn't even wait that long. It didn't seem that way anyway. That's where the fast service stopped however.   Food was slow, server was a little slow. However any issues that I was about to have at the table were fixed before I left before I had to do anything about it.   Overall very happy with the experience."}
{"text":"Great food for a reasonable cost, friendly staff and great location. The food is so good, good portions and the rolls are addicting. The waiters and hostesses are always kind and fun. This place is always busy with a bit of a wait but it is worth it. It is close to the movie theater so we tend to always eat here before or after a movie. If we don't feel like waiting we call ahead and use take out."}
{"text":"ETA 1/2/11**** Went there the day after Christmas for dinner. We were seated right away, however after waiting 11 minutes and not being asked what we want to drink, we bounced.  Found it very ironic that 1/2 of their wait staff was perceived to be screwing around out on the patio....We let their manager know that this was absolutely unacceptable and we don't know when we are going back.  There should be no reason to wait that long for a simple drink order;  We eat here several times a month, so that outta tell you something.  No matter what we order, it's phenomenal.  The steaks are always tender, the ribs are fall off the bone and the salads are the best.  I was going to rate 5 stars, but will only give 4 because a couple of times we have gone there has either been a several HOUR wait time, or they were closed due to unforeseen circumstances.  I would highly recommend Texas Roadhouse for anyone who wants good BBQ."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that by no fault of Texas Roadhouse I expected this to be horrible.  As a vegetarian when my grandmother suggested it I was expecting no choices, but after a quick glance at the online menu I saw they didn't forget the veggies!  Now the one vegetarian item on there dinner menu is a selection of 4 side dishes but that was more then enough for me.  I had the house salad (others are not vegetarian), a baked potato, veggies, and I ordered the fries as well for my son.  The veggies were surprisingly delicious I expected microwaved and covered in butter, not the case. They were yummy, the potato was good, not exceptional but I prefer Yukon golds to russets (just a personal preference). We also had the Baby Bloom to start and it was so yummy, the crust is light almost like a tempera batter then anything.  Very yummy.  Also the best part of your meal is free, don't miss out on the rolls!  Also I want to mention service was fantastic. My only issue was the pajama shorts our hostesses wore, but I think it was a 4th of July thing because they all wore red white and blue.  Not a huge issue just found it odd.    All in all I'd return if the family chose it, obviously I'm not there target audience but I'd be happily dragged along."}
{"text":"Very good steaks! Place is always busy but they turn the tables quickly. Always have had a great experience."}
{"text":"they messed up the steak. over cooked and completely dried out. asked to be charged for price of sirloin since it was dry but MOD was only willing to offer for a new one to go which came out in exactly 3 minutes which surprised me.  When I attempted to eat my new steak it was completely raw. I have to say i'm convinced this was totally intentional there is no way they would make it this raw on accident. I do not appreciate this gesture I received"}
{"text":"Good food and service!  Can always count on consistency here."}
{"text":"Wait was about 15 minutes on a Tuesday evening but was definitely worth it! Awesome drinks and appetizers! Food took a while to be served and kitchen was out of a couple menu items however the staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was fun! Will definitely return with the family."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Amazing steaks highly recommendgreat ppl great service and the price is really good for that kind of food you all should try it"}
{"text":"We haven't been here in a couple years.  Had a meager 5 piece but deliciously grilled shrimp appetizer.  6 oz sirloin & rib combo for me.  Big Fort Worth prime rib eye steak for Harley hubby.  EVERYTHING was perfect.  I have never had ribs THAT fall-off-the-bone like these before,  EVER.  Our server Gavin was superb & we dined in the small room by the door that only accommodates pairs.  Our experience was exceptional to say the least.  I am very sorry others have had such lousy experiences.  We like this restaurant.  Deeply saddened by the rejected 3 dollar tip.  THAT server should have been fired and the franchise manager reprimanded."}
{"text":"I like this chain. Decent steaks, tasty bread starters, and consistent menu. My visit today, however, highlighted downside you can encounter at Texas Roadhouse.  The steak (10oz ribeye) came medium well, even though I ordered it medium. It's not a huge deal, but when you pay $16 for a steak, it should be cooked to order. The other issue is that 50% of the time the steak comes warm but not hot. Again, if I was laying $8 for a cheap steak or understand it not coming piping hot. But this should not be the case here.  Finally, one thing that frustrated me when using the restroom was that they don't have towels to dry your hand. No paper or cloth towels. Only an air dryer. Worse, they have skimped to buying the slowest, cheapest air dryers possible. Basically they are incapable of actually drying your hands within a reasonable amount of time.  All in all, a disappointment from a restaurant that I actually like their menu."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now when my parents come into town to visit. We all enjoy a good steak and this location isn't far from where I live.  The food is top notch, especially their prime rib! The bone-in rib eye is also really good! They provide unlimited peanuts to eat while you wait. If you come on a weekend, expect to wait for a while. I totally recommend calling ahead as it can help you beat the wait.  That atmosphere is pretty solid as well. I'm personally not a fan of the country music that they have playing, but it is what it is. Bottom line, it's a great steak and I give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse should make every native Arizonan absolutely sick to their stomach...  The steak is anything but good, and they actually have a mounted saddle that unsuspecting patrons have to sit on and yell \"yeeha!\".  What a joke.   I'm never stepping foot in a Texas Roadhouse again!!"}
{"text":"This has one star because I have to include at least one. Don't go to this restaurant, manager attitude was totally unprofessional.  I would never ever go here. They need to train their staff to treat customers better.  If your corporate office wishes to contact me, I would be more than willing to communicate my concerns to them.  As a matter fact I will probably contact the corporate office myself"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Texas Roadhouse in a very long time, so I remembered the peanuts, but had forgotten about the yummy rolls with cinnamon, sugar butter. I love sweets, so for me that's a good way to start a meal. My Caesar salad was okay, very heavy on the dressing and the lettuce wasn't super crisp. I ordered the oven roasted chicken and the meat was delicious. Very moist and nicely seasoned.   I was surprised how busy it was considering we went pretty early on a week night. The service wasn't stellar, but not bad either. Overall, it made for a satisfying week night meal, but not a place I'd choose for a special night out."}
{"text":"We went here last night for a last minute dinner. We were craving barbeque and its 5 miles away from our hotel. The food was pretty decent and the price. Onion blossom was pretty good and bbq pulled pork was so so. I wish they have a better barbeque sauce though. Serving size it is decent; you will get your moneys worth. Okay, thats the food part. Now, the service - SUCKS! I don't know if its just because it's a Friday night but I think the server should pay attention to their customer more. My review is fully based on the food quality and its price and it is a solid 3 stars. Customer service, I would've put a negative. Suggestion: If you like barbeque and you have a chance try Lucille's Barbeque."}
{"text":"I had two family events here - the service, food, and prices were excellent! The peanuts and cinnamon butter rolls were served first and were a great addition to the appetizers.  I ordered the country fried sirloin the first time and the second time was their prime rib.   Both of them were tender and very good, but the prime rib was the best of the two.  My only concern was that the environment was very loud, but I was glad when the music was turned down a bit on my second visit from a family member's request."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse used to be really good, but the quality of meat they use now is not good. Go to a different steak place, really. Pretty disappointed because I used to love this place growing up as a kid."}
{"text":"This place is growing on us.  But it's almost impossible to not giggle at the repeated, obvious script of the poor hostesses that seat you.  5 steps toward the table, hostess must turn (while walking - already awkward and concerned she may trip and fall) and ask how your day is going.  Customer will always say \"fine\".  Then she takes 5 more steps forward,  turns and asks (again, while walking), \"is this your first time eating here?\".  Always exactly the same.  Always painfully awkward."}
{"text":"I went there last night with my husband for $39.99 we got 2 12 ounce porterhouse steaks an appetizer two sides plus what they call a sidekick our sidekickwas baby ribs awesome the food was awesome I had so much food our waitress is awesome and the dinner last through Sunday"}
{"text":"First of all, it was extremely loud, and the servers would stop whatever they were doing and dance when a certain song came on.  At one point they blocked the whole walkway by the checkin area at front door, and we (including my 79 year old mother) had to just stand there to wait for them to finish to walk to restroom.  I didn't remember this from our past visits, and wonder if it was because this was on a weekend.  If we weren't really hungry, we actually may have left.  Plus the fact my mother was visiting out of town and wanted to eat there.  It was very hard to have a conversation, and I was worried my 79 year old mother would get uncomfortable.  Although, my steak was overcooked, the food was enjoyable."}
{"text":"We went with the family.. That means there where 5 adults and 1 10 year old on a sugar induced high. It was interesting. Ordering took a bit since my sister has a Gluten allergy but the waitress went above and beyond. I ordered the pork chops. When the food came I got a steak? They figured out the error and went about fixing it. There was a mix up in the beverages and my diabetic father got a glass of sweet tea when he ordered Ice tea. It was more or less one disaster after another. Through it all the waitress, the manager and even the rest of the staff went above and beyond. It will forever be a memorable experience of a night full of fail but in the end everything was fixed and we left happy. The staff is human and we all make mistakes, It's how you deal with those mistakes that makes the impression."}
{"text":"Always impressed every time I've been to a Texas Roadhouse. It's a chain, so I've been to a few between Ohio and Pennsylvania.   You can't go wrong with the cinnamon butter that they start you off with. It's so good, you may find yourself tempted to cover more of your dinner than just the rolls.  The steaks are always cooked just as you request. Tonight was no different. We had the filet medallions and a portobello chicken dish. Both were delicious.    The service could have been better. It's a busy restaurant and it appeared that most of the servers appeared to be younger, so I won't fault them too much for that.   During each visit, I've usually heard a birthday being announced. Tonight there were two. There was also a balloon artist going around to tables tonight, so it's definitely a place to bring a family or kids.   For how inexpensive the Texas Roadhouse is compared to other restaurants that serve similar items, it's really a great place to check out."}
{"text":"I will never be back  My husband and I sat in the bar area for over 15 minutes and were never acknowledged while tables all around were being served  When we left we told the snarky little girl up front and her response was there isn't service in the bar area... Really so we should go to the kitchen ourselves?  And then why were others served and not us??!?"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Stopped here last night for family dinner. I've never been dissatisfied here, although my sons steak was not done right last night.  They made it right with no questions, and took $10 off our check for the inconvenience.  Amazing food and service.  Always."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. What a feast. Their rolls should be prescription-only, they are impossible to stop eating. The strip steak was good, just shy of excellent. The baked potato was prepared well and was delicious. I'd stop here again for a good steak lunch for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"A decent place to go and eat when it's not busy. Just a word of warning to people coming here, its INCREDIBLY loud. I can't really discern the source either but it's likely just a mix of the loud country music, drunks, and loud mouthed people that shout over everyone to hear themselves speak. I love there fried pickles for an appetizer, as well as the mozz sticks. The big onion thing it's a bit much I think and I'm not a huge fan, but if you love to pack your face full of 12 oz of fired onion, by all means. Just do us all a favor and take a mint afterward so you aren't clearing out the dining room every time you speak. Ok this is a serious piece of advice for this place coming from someone who has ate here 20+ times: ALWAYS order your steak two levels of done above what you actually want. If you want medium, ask for well done. I can't tell you how many times I've ordered a medium ribeye not thinking only to get a steak that's still mooing. I can only imagine what rare means in this place, but I wouldn't be surprised if it involves simply walking the cow to your table, taking out one of there cell phones, and showing it a photograph of the grill. The deserts have always been pretty satisfying here so I would just say anything you may want to get will probably be edible. The prices are not bad; certainly more reasonable than longhorn or brown derby I would say. All in all, I would recommend this place just because even though I've been disappointed many times, I find myself returning every time. Just bring some ear plugs and if you like rare steak, a trailer to bring your cow home in."}
{"text":"Standard Texas Roadhouse.  We were seated as soon as we walked in the door.  I ordered the Prime Rib and it was excellent.  I also had a caesar salad with my food."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse has always been on the top of our restaurant list as a steakhouse.  We have been to this one in the past and it used to be our favorite steakhouse.  (Read my previous review)  However, not so much anymore.    To begin with our server was a little flippant.  Perhaps, it was when he discovered we were splitting a steak.  We also split because my husband isn't so much a meat eater anymore.  That was just our server.  We also had an opportunity to have conversations with other servers who were very pleasant.    Usually it's been the big bone-in we split and that has always been amazing.  This time we did the 12 ounce ribeye with the same salad and baked potato.  The salads here are wonderful!!  We were SHOCKED when we saw the thin cut of meat we were served especially since we NEVER buy thin cut meat ourselves.  Half the steak was cooked medium (overcooked) and the other half was cooked well done (very overcooked).  Needless to say, it went back along with the huge potato that came with it.  About ten minutes later a new thin steak and a much smaller potato was served. The steak was skinny but this time it was cooked a perfect medium rare and was absolutely delicious.  I can't say it was a great experience and now that we're in the area for the winter, I know we'll probably try out other steak restaurants before we go back.  Even though the 2nd steak was delicious, it was still a thin cut and our server was lacking.  Texas Roadhouse restaurants have always been our favorite but maybe not so much in the future."}
{"text":"It's been a year and we're back in the area.  On the top of our restaurant list was Texas Roadhouse.  To rate it with 5 stars this time would be wrong.    The server was okay, not great, just okay.  At first he seemed a little flippant and definitely not the same quality of service we've had in the past.  The good thing is we also had exchanges with a couple other servers at our table who were amazing.  My husband isn't much of a meat eater so we usually just split one of their ribeye steaks along with a salad and a baked potato.  Usually it's been the big bone-in which has always been amazing.  However, this time we just did the 12 ounce ribeye with the same salad and baked potato.  The salads here are wonderful!!

{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is usually our favorite place to get steaks.  We love the seasoning and have rarely had any issues at any of the Roadhouses we visited ... except for this year.  Our first bad experience was at the location in Mesa with thin cut steaks.  The 12oz rib eye steak we ordered there was very thin.  Half of the steak was well done and the other half was medium rare.    Then, we discovered the Tempe location and had to give that one a try.  The salads served with dinner are always very good.  We love the stuff they put in it.  It's not just a bowl of lettuce.    This time I order the bone-in ribeye.  This has been my favorite steak in the past.  When delivered it looked like a thick delicious piece of meat.  However, when I cut into it, I discovered it definitely was not medium rare.  It was over cooked and closer to a medium well.  The seasoning was also missing on the steak.  The waiter didn't ask if the steaks were right and we didn't comment.    So, what's up with the Texas Roadhouse restaurants lately?"}
{"text":"Food is great as always with the chain. Customer service is amazing, Too amazing really, Sarah is a waitress there and I fell in love with her as she served me. Haha"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a delicious steak dinner!??? This particular Texas Roadhouse is close to home, so its nice coming here for the convenience fact. Not only is that a perk, but each time I have visited this location I have never been disappointed. My food is always prepared exactly how I asked for it. We went here yesterday for my mom's birthday with a pretty large party. The restaurant was very nice at working around our large party and making sure we were taken care of. We had 2 very nice waiter's who went above and beyond making sure all 17 of us were happy. I ordered the 8oz sirloin and had it covered in melted jack cheese and mushrooms! The medium rare steak was perfect and the jack cheese and mushrooms gave the steak a great kick. The mashed potatoes were covered in cheese, butter and anything else you would like them covered in. Very impressed with the staff and was very happy with my food!  Thanks for making it a nice evening out for my moms birthday! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"One word of warning: This place can get absolutely packed, and the area of the parking lot it is in can make it tough to find a spot unless you want to trudge a bit, so plan ahead.  Once you're in, you are promptly greeted by a massive barrel of peanuts. Yes, a barrel of peanuts. After that, you will see a hostess stand, and if you get there at an off-time (there are a couple), you may be seated promptly, so grab a handful of peanuts and head to your seat - the buckets on the tables are often empty, or close to it. Otherwise, grab a handful of peanuts and be prepared to wait - potentially for a while.  Whenever you are actually seated, they stroll you past a case displaying steak where you can allegedly order a particular cut, which is a nice, fancy steakhouse touch. The problem is that even if you go here regularly, you probably have no idea that you want to do this, as most people like to at least sit down and get an idea for what else is on the menu first. Maybe re-ordering this step would be a nice idea, to after you have a chance to look over the menu? Or bring a few cuts by the table? I don't know - it would just be nice not to do it as everyone is walking by en masse.  Anyway, the staff is generally attentive, except for the bit every half hour or so where you get a line dance in the middle of the floor. Or when they are singing happy birthday to someone on a saddle. Or just not paying attention as you try and get a drink.  If you do get them to come by, they are really friendly, it's just getting that attention that can be difficult, so make sure when you do get a server to stop, you are ready to ask for drinks, ask questions about the menu, place your orders for appetizers, entrees, desserts, ask for extra napkins, have them bring some more peanuts and deliver the check on their way back (make sure you have your payment method ready when they come back, too).  In the midst of all that, and if you haven't filled up on all the peanuts, the food is decent, for a mid-level steakhouse chain."}
{"text":"we came about three weeks prior, had great food and great service, the second time around the server working the bar area was so inattentive, I had to get up out of my seat to get a refill and more bread, the manager walked around like a goofball talking to other employees instead of asking tables how their meal was. my boyfriend got his food on a child's plate with 7 cold French fries. what a joke !"}
{"text":"YAY!!!! I am the biggest Texas Roadhouse addict and this location is the BOMB! It's so big and the service was great! The food was absolutly mouthwatering, as usual!"}
{"text":"We arrived and asked for a wheelchair accessible table. We were told 10 min. 25 min later we were shown to a table that a wheelchair could not fit into. We waited 15 more minutes to be seated finally. The service was good after that but not recommended for someone in a wheelchair."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse used to be a great place to eat, but recently it has gone downhill. The rolls with cinnamon/honey butter are still awesome, but the food is about average. This used to be a regular spot for large family gatherings, but now they have a new policy that prevents parties of 9 or larger from sitting together. I thought \"Texas\" was about \"big\"? As a chain they are still about 3 stars, but this particular location has been suffering quality issues, and now the seating policy just ruined it as a common location for family gatherings."}
{"text":"Let start by saying we knew our wait for a table would be about 1 hour, and we were ok with that. However,  we did not think our wait for our food after we ordered it would be over 30 minutes. To top it off, when our food did arrive, all 5 orders were lukewarm at best. The manager did come, right before our ordered arrived to apologize for the delay. I was very disappointed by the entire experience."}
{"text":"I haven't had this place in YEARS!! My neighbors asked us to go because they were craving it. We went at a good time, found good parking and got sat immediately! Score!! Plus we got fresh rolls as soon as we sat down.   We got sat near the bar area and service was top notch. I got the chicken fingers tossed in buffalo sauce and a salad and a cup of chili. Salad had good toppings but there were some brown pieces of lettuce in it. Ranch dressing was good. Chili was pretty good. It was topped with cheese and onions. I saw a few pieces of corn in it, wasn't sure if it was supposed to be in there or not. My husband got a chicken and mushroom dish with green beans. He liked the chicken but thought the green beans were very salty. I tasted it and it was. Next time I'm gonna maybe try a steak!"}
{"text":"We come to this location every so often and typically have a positive experience.  Last night Mack was our server and she was fantastic.  She gets a 5 rating for sure.  But we have to knock ourw overall rating down to a four because 1) the sweet tea wasn't sweet, 2) the prime rib wasn't hot, 3) the seasoned rice was super salty, and 4) the rolls, which are typically fantastic, were overcooked, hard, and just not good."}
{"text":"Miranda was seventy-five kinda of awesome! OMG! Her service and her service alone pushed this review to the full five stars. We arrived after doing the online check-in which is a fabulous feature. Thumbs up for that! It allowed us to have less than a 10 minute wait at the restaurant.  When we were seated though the booth wasn't well cleaned and I had to wait for someone to come clean the bench seat so we could sit down. Thumbs down for that! But then Miranda arrived! She was friendly. She was knowledgeable. She was efficient. She kept our glasses refilled. She was fabulous! The food was good and came out just as ordered. Overall a very nice experience."}
{"text":"We've always had a great meal here. Usually a wait but the food is worth it. Only complaint is trying to find a parking space since the place is always packed. Good food and decent prices."}
{"text":"Never having been to the Texas Roadhouse  I didn't know what to expect.  I loved the peanuts.  It made me feel right at home.  My server, Keisha was the best.  She gave great service and was very social.  I like that in a server.  She never neglected us and I love the before six $9.99 dinners.  I had the six oz. steak and it was cooked just right--something that I rarely get.  It was so much better than the usual happy hour--value at a great price.  I will return to this Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Service is great at this location, food is a 50/50 shot some times. I have gone several times and it just depends on the day if your food is good or if its just \"eh\" I will say the management here was good they ruined our anniversary dinner, I reached out and complained due to the problems we had and they bought us dinner and it was great. I will go back but my expectations on the food are a crap shoot on quality. The main issue is the consistency with the food over and under cooking the meat is the biggest problem."}
{"text":"I am traveling through town and wanted to place a quick takeout order.... I had to call 3 times... Someone would answer and place me on hold... Finally the third time I got to place my order... I went to pick up my order and there were several hostesses at the hostess stand and not one of them spoke to me... Finally it must have been the carry out girl finally came and waited on me... Food was great but service was terrible... I would defiantly choose another restaurant!"}
{"text":"You'll find great steaks here at a moderate price. I loved the rolls and honey butter. Service was very attentive and friendly. But don't go here if you want to talk. I took my grandson and wanted a chance to get to know him better, but we could barely hear each other, their background music and other noise was so loud. My grandson loved the bucket of peanuts and being able to throw the shells on the floor."}
{"text":"Good as always.  friendly staff and good food.  They let the Peoria Fire Dept. fund raise money for the 19 firefighters who just died in the fires.  This really shows how they support the local community.  This makes them top notch in my book.  Will come back in the future."}
{"text":"Can't say much for the country music. However, the food was super delicious. But the best part was the service, Markus in particular. He went above and beyond with his service."}
{"text":"This place is facking loud. Imagine dinner at Chucky cheese, with hick music blaring,  and line dancing in the middle of the walk ways. And if that isn't enough every asshole on the west side goes there for their birthday.  This makes the staff extra happy as they get to go full retard as they parade through the restaurant clapping and singing happy birthday.  I'm am in a rock band, so for me to say this is a zoo, it's that bad.   Bread and butter is very good.  The steaks are full of sinu and grissel, and very fatty. I would rather chew on an old gym shoes leather, it's cheaper.  The only steak that is worth a damn is the cowboy cut 20oz .  Get that steak and split it with your date, if you are able to actually get a date.  I would avoid this place if you can. Eat at McDonald's you'll get better meat. This place really is a 3 ring circus.    Review time. The meats suck.  The bread is the bomb though, and know one cares it's your birthday. Go to Chunky Cheese if you want a parade, I'm trying to eat over here!"}
{"text":"This visit was so much better. Our server Kelsey was fantastic. Very attentive, friendly made sure our order was correct."}
{"text":"There were three of us that ate here last Friday, October 2. The waitress was a seasoned waitress and she was very good. The Texas roadhouse rolls  that they are known for of course are awesome.  We all had 12 ounce sirloin's. Cooked to medium rare awesome. Salads were a good size not too large and very fresh and good. Have a baked potato loaded it was $.99 extra to have it loaded potato was not very good did not compare to the restaurant next-door. The reason why I am only giving it two stars very very noisy loud you could not communicate with the person that was next to you or to the waitress. The night manager came by to see how we were doing and we complained about the noise. He did not want to hear that he said that is why people come to their place. I do I think the line dancing was fun to watch however we live in a very large large senior community area surrounded. It appears they could have a special room that would be not so noisy. Will have a hard time going back"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten out much the past few weeks which is why I forgot to review this place, whoops!  Me and the bestie went to dinner a few weeks ago, it was a Thursday so busy but not super crowded. We were seated immediately and I noticed they were getting rid of the peanuts on the floor. Super classy, haha  Anyways, it took about 4 pass-bys to get our rolls, but we got our water and I ordered the drink special which was the Strawberry Sickle...they had just started that drink and it tasted good but I can't vouch for the amount of alcohol in it, it was good though.   Since giving up beef, I was disappointed they don't have any stellar chicken burgers/sandwiches on the menu, so I got the chicken cluckers or whatever, which I realize I always ordered and then get an don't like. I got the chili and fries as sides though which held me over. The service was good, my friend left his keys at the table and they held on to them before we came back.   I'll definitely return, hopefully I just remember to order something different."}
{"text":"It had been a while since i had come here. I called ahead and got a number for. 15 -20min wait. First time I used the call ahead service. I arrived and they sat us within 3 min of our arrival. Initial contact at host station was friendly and cordial with a smile. Our waitress arrived at our table right away with a smile and got our drink order. She returned often to our table to check on us and every time was friendly and professional. I had the salmon which was cooked just perfect for my taste. Overall our service was excellent and our food very succulent. Will definitely return to this location."}
{"text":"Food was good however Way way to long for BBQ. Told 30 min wait turn out it was 60 min."}
{"text":"We came from Cali and wanted a decent steak for a decent price, needless to say Texas Roadhouse exceeded our expectations. Their service was most definitely legendary, and our waitress Kalani was amazing. Such a fun environment, amazing staff, and the most tender and delicious steak (hard to get all that at one place )They made my husband's birthday one for the books! Thanks Kalani and staff for the great hospitality! Next time we are in Arizona, we will definitely be sure to stop by! Until next time, yee haw !"}
{"text":"We love eating at the Texas Roadhouse. The wait is never very long, service is always great, and the food is wonderful. I have never eaten a bad meal here! My favorite is the salmon, side salad, and a potato. We eat there at least twice a month, if not more."}
{"text":"Been here 20 times and only once had a bead meal. Just ate here now the ribeye was amazing full of flavor and unbelievable price. The chili is fantastic and I love the sweet potatoes."}
{"text":"The steak was burnt on the edges, the salad lacked freshness and the baked potatoe was a little salty. The service wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is okay. Nothing great, but not bad either. This place is always packed. Went here with my wife and son over the weekend. We had a gift card and needed to use it before it expired. I have been to these all over the country and they are all about the same for service and food. Nothing bad, just ok. It's comfort food and a familiar name. I had the single pork chop with the sweet potato. Both were very good and full of flavor. One of my favorites on their menu. Of course the hot rolls a really good too. The only thing I don't like is the bucket of peanuts on the table. I don't touch those. I have no clue who's had their hand has been in there."}
{"text":"Used call ahead reservation and was seated in 5 min which was great. But, very disappointed in the quality of the steaks and they were overcooked. My medium rare large filet was about an 1/2 inch thick and medium well at best. My husbands porterhouse had so much gristle he could hardly eat it. Far cry from the awesome steaks just across the parking lot at Firebirds. Will not return."}
{"text":"I eat here too much i think!  I have this place down, as far as how to get things just ordered right and when to go.  ribs are great, and i always eat too much.  Went there last night (try to do my share of boosting the economy) and went with just 1/3 rack of ribs, because i knew i would have to finish my wife's and my two kids food too.  still too much and i had some weird dreams that night with my full belly.  love it!"}
{"text":"Time for a major update, some staffing changes have occurred as well as a major reduction in staff dancing that has made the service quality go up exponentially!   Depending on when you arrive the waits can be horrendous but they do a great job in turning over their tables. One of my favorite tricks is checking in the bar and avoiding the line at the door, if there is an empty seat at the bar, it's \"zip in and dine\" and unless I have a big party of 4 or more, it's worked successfully almost every time!  The food is consistent but there is one place that I have expressed concern to management the last 2 times I was there. First, micro-waved potato skins, they came out with half the cheese un-melted, I sent them back and you can see that they were micro-waved, they were hard and oily, not cooked under a broiler like they should have been cooked. Second, the steaks in the window seem to be for show and tell because I've ordered a rib-eye of the last 2 times I was there and I don't understand how a nice thick steak in the window can become a tiny little thin piece of fat when it hits your plate. They are doing something in the kitchen that did not sit well with me for a 50 dollar meal for 2.   Overall major improvements and some room to go in others."}
{"text":"Don't think I'll be going back.    This place has literally gone the way of other chains where they think they get to big to really care about the quality and people will still go.    Everything was terrible.  We came in for an early meal around 330 or so. Place wasn't busy by any means.  Waitress was completely disinterested in helping or even accurately taking our order.  She had to come back at least three times to verify what we ordered.  Even then once the food came our orders still were incorrect.   The food was just as bad.  For being a steak house they should know how to cook a medium steak.  Everything was over cooked and dry and over salted.  My steamed vegetables tasted like I was eating salt rocks. I mean it's steam veggies why are they so salty.  My girlfriend ordered the bbq chicken and it was an overlooked chicken breast completely engulfed by bbq sauce where you had to scoop away sauce just to find the chicken.    Everything was just so disappointing as I used recall this pace was decent.  But once again like other places I've been to. The best thing I had on the menu was the bread and cinnamon/honey butter."}
{"text":"I've been to some fancy steakhouses, but the bone in ribeye I just had ranks amongst the best!  And Cece will be happy with bone I'm bringing her."}
{"text":"We went to dinner here last night to celebrate my parents 28th wedding anniversary & this is one of their favorite places to eat. We waited forever to get seated even though we used the call ahead method. We were told we'd wait about 10-20 mins and ended up waiting about 45mins, that's the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars. First off, our waiter Matthew was amazing! Right from the get go he was so nice and attentive, made sure we had everything we needed and even brought my son an extra coloring book and crayons. The food was really good and everything was cooked to perfection. I tend to nitpick when it comes to my food and I  had NO complaints! Our waiter Matthew even gave us some free rolls to bring home :) . If you're looking for a place with amazing service & great food this is the place to go, it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Reminded me of a steakhouse version of Joe's Crab Shack. The service was very good and we got seated quickly on a busy night. The steak tasted good and was delivered as ordered. The green beans were awful and the baked potato was too salty. The grilled shrimp was good, but side of rice it came with was bland. It seemed like the main courses are done well, but the sides are lacking."}
{"text":"Great place to eat if you're really hungry and you want a great steak as the Steaks are of amazing quality.  The staff has always been really great and very nice.  Fun atmosphere although a little too circussy and kid friendly for my taste but I can ignore all of that for a great steak and theirs are the best!"}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is a pretty decent chain with a quality meat. It is a great value. My first trip to the Mccandless location was good. I had a free appetizer coupon so we ordered the onion and it was good. Too spicy for my 3 year old though. My hubby and I shared the 20+ oz ribeye. Ordered it medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. We got two extra sides, baked potato and salads. I ordered Cesar. Mistake. The dressing was gross. I was holding my 12 month old baby while he slept so I thought I would get a salad that was already spun with dressing. Don't do it. Yuck. I didn't even eat it. The regular salads are great and I should have got that. Baked potato was good as usual. Hubby told waitress his tasted different maybe a little sweet, once we had finished. She sent us one home no charge. Thought that was nice!  Good service!  I suggest going early because it fills up fast. Plus they have great early bird dinner specials for $9. A good selection too. Will definitely come back and eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is going downhill.  We were seated very quickly (Wednesday night at 7:00, 10 minute wait).   There were no rolls during the entire service, no refills, and just a big lack of attention.   The server was nice, pleasant and took care of us when she stopped by.   Not thrilled about this visit at all, and this has been par for the course here over the last few visits."}
{"text":"I'm not a big country or chain restaurant fan so I wasn't expecting to like this restaurant, but I REALLY LIKE THIS RESTAURANT!  From the shelled peanuts in a bucket at the table; to the line dancing in the aisles; to the delicious food; it's all a lot of fun and a great experience.  The service is exceptional, the employees really seem to like working there.  They are energetic, friendly and helpful.  The food is great, Love the dinner rolls!!!  I wasn't expecting the salmon to be anything special, but I must admit it is one of the best salmon dishes I have ever had, cooked perfectly and seasoned properly, it really doesn't get much better.  I also like that it's a place I can take everyone in my family.  My mom's a vegetarian, my dad hard to please and other family members have some diet restrictions, but the menu is flexible enough to accommodate everyone.  The servers know their stuff too, so special requests are not a problem and they know what is in their food so dietary restrictions questions are confidently answered.  It's a good time, with good food, and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"All the steak type places are pretty much the same.  I have the smothered chicken with sweet potato.  I enjoyed the meal since it was quick and filling.  I normally try to avoid chains but again it wasn't terrible.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Been waiting more than 30 minutes. Better be worth the wait! Really want to leave at this point.   Can't really say it was worth the wait. I was grumpy by the time we sat down. We ordered a Blossom and our food. All was delivered all at the same time. My Chicken Fried Chicken was actually pretty good. HUGE portion. My side of chilli (which I used to love) was cold. When I had it for lunch the next day it was horrible, tasted like burnt scrapings from the bottom of a pan.   Had this been my first experience here, I would not return, but I have been before & loved it. Hopefully this  was a fluke, I'll still give it another go based on past experiences."}
{"text":"There Ribeye steaks are the best around always fresh always perfect. Go late at night and there is no wait"}
{"text":"We arrived the Saturday night before Mother's Day @9:30 p.m. hubby almost wanted to leave it looked so busy but I spotted a bar so I checked in. They said 10 to 20 minutes. By time we got on the bar stools and got drinks our table was ready. We both ordered the full rack of ribs so we have some to take home. They're very good I got extra sauce too, smoky and tender $20 full rack with two sides. Hot rolls are good too. Took awhile to get our dinners for just 2 but they were busy.  We had 2 boxes of ribs leftover for Sun...yumm."}
{"text":"I had been here a few times and the food was decent. If you like noise this is the place for you! On my last visit I asked for Prime rib which I know is suppose to be on the rare side. My prime rib came out raw with it lucky to have been cooked more than 20 seconds in either side. Its was pretty much flesh from a cow with blood covering the entire thing. I told the server that this wasn't even close to how prime rib should be. He took it back to the kitchen where about 10mins later he returned and the entire thing was extremely well done close to charcoal. Apparently whoever was in the kitchen was upset I sent it back and was being a smart a** . I didn't even eat it, my entire table was done and they were all in shock....I couldn't be bothered complaining. I won't be back and Ill sure share this story with anyone thinking of going there."}
{"text":"Walked in to Texas RH with my daughter was seated right away, waited 10minutes for somebody to come ask us for drinks, nobody came. 3 waitresses stood by the front table and joked around. Asked another server to grab somebody for me. Nobody came after about 7 minutes. Got up and walked out nobody said a word to us as we walked out. Went right next door to LongHorn told them what happened and then even gave us a free dish. Thanks LongHorn"}
{"text":"Food is awesome service (Anne) was fantastic. You would have to screw up big time for me never to return. It's new so growing pains are expected."}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful. Delicious food.. Well worth the wait if it's the weekend... lol"}
{"text":"Honestly this has to be the worst dinning experence we have had in the last 10 years, and I am only posting this after a call to corporate to verify my suspicions that they use canned vegetables as side dishes.  Ws told by the person in corporate guest relation that they use secret spices to make their canned side dishes special.  Honestly I order a steak, my other half order salmon, and it was nothing sort of unspecular.  About the only good thing I can say about where we were served was the crustose on my salad were wonderful.  First & last time in this place.  Manager on duty said we should give themn another chance.  My mistake was not going to the Outback accross the lot after we waited almost 20 minute, never got call after bet old it would be a few minutes, and we told when we ask why were were not seated, we forget to call you."}
{"text":"The food tasted good it was very busy and loud though not good to go if you are wanting a nice dinner with relaxing conversation that's for sure.  Not sure if it was the food but 5 or 6 hours after eating the steak I was sick as a dog I contacted the health department and let them know what I had eaten just in case it was some kind of food poisoning don't know for sure but as soon as I got sick I was fine. Just a heads up!"}
{"text":"Very nice people servers staff I sat in the bar area great customer service steak was perfect plenty of good bread and good drinks definitely keep going back"}
{"text":"Probably the best steak in Champaign. Prize is good. But noisy."}
{"text":"I have been to other Texas Roadhouses here in the Valley and Back East. This location is my favorite. This has to do with the outstanding service we received tonight from Garrett. It was my eleven year old son's birthday, and Garrett made all of us feel special. He kept our drinks full and made sure all our special requests ( Extra Extra Crispy Steak Fries!) We did not have a wait because we got there at five o' clock, but there was a line out the door by the time we left. My son saw them dancing and said he wants work there when he is in college. The whole staff was on top of their game, and acted like working there was the real happiest place on earth. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant! The bone in ribeye is amazing! And the rolls and butter are even better! Call ahead so you don't have to wait in the long lines :)"}
{"text":"I just had to write in to express my thanks to the Manager Edmanda. I went in yesterday and the service from the waitress was not a good one. She totally forgot about us and it was just 2 people at my table. While waiting on condiments our food had gotten cold since we waited 15 minutes. So, the Manager smoothed things over by making us brand new meals to go and giving us free entrée vouchers for next time. My friend that was with me didn't request her dinner be re-made but the Manager showed up with a complete dinner anyway. She figured it was my friends first time dining at TR that she couldn't let her leave unhappy. I must say normally service is great and I will be returning. Just an off night for the waitress I suppose. Thanks to management for saving the day."}
{"text":"I will never go here again. I've never had a problem until tonight. First off our server was jeanie or some shit. My aunt celebrated her birthday here (I told them when I arrived to surprise her). If i wanted my aunt to be around whores I would've taken her to a strip club but I came here instead. Not only was our service bad but our waitress was a bitch & had attitude for no reason. She rather get groped by an drunk old white man than to serve her table. & I think that old drunk guy pissed her off by feeling on this other blonde chick so she took out on us. I told the manager (some black guy) her bad behavior & he did nothing. My other aunts & i had to tell the manager it was my aunt birthday about three times before they came over. The waitress didn't ask if we wanted desserts or anything. She just gave us our check (of course with an attitude). Then she told all the servers in the back something b/c all the girls came out looking at me with their weird ass stuck up bitch face. I seen one of the cooks i knew,he asked me if i was giving her shit & i told him no but shes being a bitch, then some goofy ass blonde chick said she wouldnt be a bitch if you weren't. This restaurant needs to hire better servers & managers. If these trashy girls want to be whores for some tips they need to work at a strip club not a restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It was better than I expected. I reminded me of an Outback Steakhouse food mixed with a Buffalo Wild Wings bar area. They food was delicious and the bar area was plenty of fun with the televisions playing multiple channels. The wait time on a Friday night was almost an hour but it was well worth it. The steak was delicious and cooked exactly to my liking. The price wasn't that bad either. It was very equivalent to any other restaurant since you are getting meat. The fresh peanuts that are given and around the restaurant was pretty cool because you can eat them and toss the shells. The employees did a dance performance to a song a couple times during the few hours I was there. They were entertaining and even invited customers to join in on their dance performance. Overall, I would recommend going there to anyone who wanted to try a new restaurant. I will definitely visit again the next time I am back in town."}
{"text":"Caesar salad was over dressed.  Baked potato was not cooked through. Prime rib was excellently cooked, au jus was a perfect match.  Service was friendly amd prompt.."}
{"text":"First off I'll start by saying I am a larger man and booths are rather uncomfortable for me. So when we arrived I specifically asked for a table. The young stick thin little girls working the hostess booth were less than happy to be asked such a request. At this point they could have said the could not accommodate that request due to lack of tables. That I would have understood and gone somewhere else. Instead they had us wait 45 min then seat us at a booth anyway. There way to fix the problem was to put a chair in the walkway which of course is rather embarrassing. The waitress was very apologetic. The manager offered to have us wait even longer for 1 of their 3 tables to come open. And to give us a free app. I don't want anything free. I just want to be comfortable and not embarrassed. The service and food was excellent as always. Wish I could give 5 stars but comfort and the ability to not be embarrassed has to account for something."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here, where have you been?  Very well priced steakhouse with tasty eats.  We go probably twice a month if not more.  Typically I order Ribeye, Filet, or Tbone.  But I'm also a big fan of their country fried chicken.  We also typically order a different appetizer each time, they are all good.  If you are looking for fancy steakhouse, this isn't the spot.  But if you are looking for beef and don't want to pay a ton, you have found the place!"}
{"text":"They have several menu options for $8.99 if you go before 6pm.  Great deal!  Busy when we arrived; service and food were good."}
{"text":"Pulled pork was too dry and tasted brunt. Took me 10 minutes to get a refill. The girls at the front desk were friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I love coming here! First of all, the prices are great and food is amazing! Today I got the Ft. Worth Ribeye and it comes with 2 sides! Barely ate half my food bc i ate many of the unlimited rolls and the delicious butter. For my sides, i had a sweet potato which was huge and green beans. Yummmm. The steak great. Very juicy and tasty. And the servers are great! Thanks to our server today Shayna(i think)Texas Roadhouse never disappoints. Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Very friendly atmosphere. Everyone said Hi as we walked in the door. It was very busy, but we got right in.  Our server Cheyenne was professional and very pleasant.  The only negative I would have to say is it took a little too long for someone to greet us after we sat down and take our drink order.  Minor!!!!  Food was good and served in a timely manner.  Atmosphere was fine.  My P's enjoyed the restaurant and said they would go back, not an easy task for them. Great Job Texas Roadhouse..."}
{"text":"Service was on point! No wait, smiles, menue suggestions...just very comfortable and friendly. Dee was our bartender, She was super awesome...thank you for making our 27th anniversary even better!"}
{"text":"I am always mad at myself after I eat at Texad Roadhouse because I get so carried away with the delicious appetizers that I never leave enough room for my entree or dessert! But it always makes for a satisfying leftover meal the next day :)  Totally delicious food. It's a tradition in my family to go here every time my parents come to visit. Great service, great environment, even better food. A+!"}
{"text":"This has become our regular go-to restaurant as it just keeps getting better. Try the Chicken Cesar salad with homemade croutons and Roadhouse fresh dressing...absolutely delicious. The best Cesar I've ever had. Their steaks are all delicious and well cooked. Love their hot fresh rolls and cinnamon butter....to die for."}
{"text":"Three words you need to know for this place: call ahead seating. I could probably leave it at that for crucial info you need.  If you have a peanut allergy, you should probably stay away any Texas Roadhouse establishment. #allofthepeanuts  We came to eat on a Saturday night before a trip to the movies. It was packed and there were a lot of people waiting. Luckily, Andrea's husband called ahead to put our names on the list. We walked in and were seated about five minutes later. Sorry to everybody else. Actually, no. Sorry, not sorry.  Our service was great. I got a ribeye with grilled mushrooms and onions, loaded baked potato, and a salad. We also went through two baskets of rolls. If you have no will power, don't agree to the second basket. My steak was cooked perfectly. I really liked how the server came back right after we got our food to ensure that all our steaks were cooked properly.   This is a fairly large Texas Roadhouse. It does get quite busy, so keep that in my mind if you plan to head here on a weekend night."}
{"text":"I had a pretty good steak here.  Out of the five of us, I was the only one not thoroughly pleased.  The medium rare they gave me was a bit too medium for me, but the flavor was good.    There are a lot of cute girls working there, and our waitress was attentive and courteous.  If I lived in the area, and was perhaps a bit younger, that alone would probably bring me back.    You can't make reservations, but you CAN call ahead.  That saved us a good 20 minutes. They were also spot on with their estimate, even though the lines were out the door."}
{"text":"Disgusting - bring me cold ribs I can understand it happens - super heat then so that they are rubbery as hell and put fresh sauce on them .... I'm a Texas Roadhouse fan but not this location EVER! Just shocked that they tried to pass that off as food, manager was useless, he was address a complaint but I got really mad when I could tell he didn't really care was just too quick to pull out his coupon, it's not about the money, come talk to me before you go check with the kitchen I really don't care what they think .... nuking my food to a mess and putting some sauce on it should embarrass you, period! Plus they charged me for my beer, which is fine because it's not like I was there to try and get a free beer but seriously, now it's almost 9pm and I need dinner. If you're in Madison don't fall for the location, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! Please!"}
{"text":"Perhaps just the time we were here; but it started out with my mother in laws water glass having some unknown substance in her water, then a fly in our rolls and then I had a hair or something similar in my salad. The waitresses are like a programmed machine where they try to get through their speech prior to you telling them what you want. The main dishes were tasty. And the beer was at least cold. Overall I think we were just having a string of bad luck."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and service.  I've been here dozens of times and have never had a bad meal or service."}
{"text":"Love the warm bread and cinnamon butter they give you. Salads are fresh. Good selection of sides. The food is consistently good no matter where you are. I've been to locations in MI, AZ, TX, WI and OK and they are all great."}
{"text":"Garrett our waiter, did an exceptional job at waiting on 6 of us.  He was on point with refills and making my brothers first time experience awesome! There were sometimes where we didn't see him but he made up for it by going above and beyond with his polite assertive attitude and followed through with filling our drinks and providing more bread. I ordered 8oz sirloin medium well with half slab ribs and the ribs were 40% dry but got extra BBQ sauce. However my steak was medium rare instead of medium well. He took it back and got it cooked.  The manager came and brought it to me personally and apologized.  She even asked my brother how his first time experience was and he was shocked. Haha. Overall even through there were a tad misses, they still followed through 100%.  Best service I've ever received at Texas Roadhouse!"}
{"text":"It's a roadhouse, if you've been to one you've been to em all. if you want a steak or a burger it's a good place to go and the prices are better than the garbage you get at LONGHORN. Plus they portions are decent. Endless rolls and salad i believe.....or maybe salad with every meal. Idk either way i always end up bringing food home. honestly i get forced to go there and don't necessarily like roadhouse......im sick of it but honestly thats the worst i could say and thats my problem not theirs. The resteraunt is decent and clean, staff is good, food is good. Although i dont like roadhouses, when i AM forced to go i prefer this one cause it has a better ambience/layout. It's a little smaller than some of the others but usually not too packed."}
{"text":"This location for Texas Roadhouse is the worst. We have gone here twice and both times ordered ice tea with lemon. Well the lemons had an insect of some kind on them. This location is not as clean as others we have eaten at. We will not eat at this location again."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place out tonight for the first time and I was literally blown away, something that does not happen very often at all.   Where to begin? We showed up around 5pm on a Saturday and were seated in less than five minutes, which was impressive. Everyone that greeted us seemed genuinely upbeat and friendly and this continued to be the case the entire time we were there.   Our server showed up and when we told her we were new customers, she took a few minutes to walk us through the menu and highlight some of the changes that weren't on there yet (coleslaw side, for example) as well as make some recommendations on what to try if we couldn't decide. We both really appreciated the help and it seemed very sincere, rather than just a canned spiel for new customers.   We skipped the appetizers and instead gorged ourselves on the ridiculously delicious rolls they provide from the get-go, the second you get seated. I have had the rolls at similar themed restaurants in the valley and these are 10x better than any of them, an assessment that my wife also agreed with.   For our meals, I went with the pulled pork platter with chili and coleslaw, while my wife got the BBQ chicken with veggies. The chili was excellent, just spicy enough and served at the perfect temperature. I loved it and would definitely get it again, hands down some of the best restaurant chili I've had. The pulled pork, that was deliciousness on an entirely different level. My mouth was watering when it showed up and I was hooked on the first bite. I have been to a lot of places that offered pulled pork, but never have I tasted any that was even half as good as this. I literally devoured the entire plate, save for the two bites I shared with my wife, who also loved it. I will definitely be ordering this in the future and can't wait to have it again, it was sinfully good. My wife's chicken was cooked perfectly and was very juicy and moist, and the BBQ sauce was spot on. My wife said she'd definitely order it again and had no complaints at all.   My only comment on the food, which is something I've noticed others mentioning, is that the steak fries are a bit heavy on the salt or the seasoning or both. It's hard to tell, but whatever it is, it's a little overpowering. I definitely wouldn't subtract a star for this, but I'm pointing it out in case people are picky about that sort of thing, because if so you might want to try a different side.   The service, I have to say, was spectacular the entire evening. I was asked if I wanted lemon in my ice tea and said no, as I prefer it without. I received no less than four replacement glasses of tea (I guess they don't refill but instead just bring a new one) and not once did I get a lemon. How awesome is that, considering the place was packed by the time we left? Our server was definitely on the ball. We also got a visit from a service manager who gave us a bag of free peanuts to take home and bring back for a free appetizer as a way of recognizing us as new customers and thanking us for our business, which I thought was a really nice gesture. It was also cool to see the manager and servers doing some clapping and dancing to the music at one point, my wife and I both got a kick out of that and it seemed like the servers were actually having fun with it rather than just going through the motions for the sake of it.   On the whole, I would say that this is definitely one of my new favorite places and I can't wait to go back and try the pulled pork again, along with giving some of the desserts a try. Between the awesome service and the top-notch food, I would recommend this place to anyone. If anyone deserves a full five stars, this is it!"}
{"text":"Good place if you are willing to wait for a long time to get a drink, receive the incorrect food, and have a mediocre steak.  They do have reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I told myself that I was not going to write a bad review for the night that my boyfriend and I had a couple of nights ago, so I won't. I will still frequent Texas Roadhouse, but I would like to offer some advice for the staff.  Unfortunately, Google informed us that on Sunday the closing hour was at 10. When we showed up at 9, we found out it was 9:30 instead. Being a server, I know how terrible that feeling is when people come in so close to closing. Instead of making us feel welcome regardless of the time we arrived, the hostess gave us the worst attitude that the face of a restaurant could give us. Not cool.. Our server was sweet and took our order, but failed to realize (our fault as well) that we did not have silverware after 10 minutes of us sitting there with salads. We failed multiple times to get the attention of any other waitstaff. It was really busy, so I understand. Things got worse when my medium-rare steak came out completely bloody, like they just cut it off the cow (lol). They fixed it, and offered complimentary food and whatnot. I was no longer hungry at the point of receiving my fixed food.. Everyone was very accommodating, including the manager. I really appreciate the server being wholeheartedly sorry for our service. And... I understand the reality of people still in a restaurant when you are trying to close and do side work, but it is super super important to keep checking up on your tables so that they can actually eat, or even enjoy their food.   We will come back! So no worries! Just work on some stuff please! :)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and not a big fan,  the wife wanted to go so that's why we went.  6 people in our party,  sat where we wanted as not busy. Got drinks and the combo starter,  then proceeded to open the cutlery which is rolled in black cloth napkins,  only to find that everyone's cutlery was filthy,  got the server who replaced them all,  opened them up again and they were all filthy again.  Asked for a manager,  who came over and laughed about it saying sorry it was a mistake. The FIRST time is a mistake,  the 2nd time someone is in incompetent and not doing their job.  My thing is the cutlery is all hand rolled so the person rolling MUST have seen they were dirty?  We walked out and the service manager heard me say the place was disgusting and he talked us into staying,  replaced everything on the table and said he'd take care of us.  Good was pretty poor and a $10 credit on the bill was insulting.  We will definitely not be back.  Outback Steakhouse right next door,  you guys just won a customer"}
{"text":"One of my favorite steakhouses in all Phoenix. Fair price for what you get; great service, mouth watering food, lively atmosphere. Madison at the front, Tori our server, and the gal that brought us to our seats all did such a good job. Clearly there is great training going on in this place... the reality of it is, they care; even on a small basis of life, it's that extra little bit goes a mile in a customers eyes. Thanks for the good food and good work!"}
{"text":"Always yummy! The steak is outstanding and the salmon isn't bad either. I love this steakhouse far more than other more expensive places. There can be a bit of a wait during dinner time but I don't mind because the food is always awesome. The appetizers are also good, especially the onion blossom."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Problem is you can not hear yourself think , the music is too loud. The place rips off the Crab Shack . Not good"}
{"text":"The family and I went to celebrate our son's 18th birthday.  There was 5 of us including a 2 year old.  The atmosphere was very upbeat and actually thrilled the baby.  He was non stop smiling, enjoyed the crayons and the Mac & cheese and apple sauce.  Birthday boy also enjoyed Texas Roadhouse.  He wanted steak and was a good enough sport to indulge his parents and participate in the birthday cheer by getting on the saddle thing and wearing the plastic cowboy hat.  We all had a good time!  The food tasted great but there were a couple mix-ups.  I ordered a 6oz medium rare and he ordered a 8oz medium, with different sides. I got his steak and he got mine but the sides were correct.  I knew my steak wasn't medium rare but didn't want to complain, but once I saw his steak, after we were eating, I realized what happened.  Too late to do anything about it so I just let him have the rest of my steak. Even with that mix up, we had a great birthday celebration.  I'm looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"I was very interesting coming her I was over looked by the Young Lady when you First enter to be seated I was very uncomfortable  with the service I receive by the server I Felt like I was been watched and mircomanage while eating my Food every she will keep Aporching my table i was very unpleasant"}
{"text":"I just want to start of and say our server Jody was great!  But the host was horrible!!For starters when we walked in she did not acknowledge us but she looked right at us. Then about 3 minutes later she said follow me. So we did, so she sat with bread and butter and no plates and silverware. She was just rude...I love that she was chomping gum!  But once again our server was GREAT. She was very attentive!! We will not be back!"}
{"text":"We made reservations and came as a party of 12, 3 kids and 9 adults for my father in law's 80th birthday. We sat at two separate tables.  The restaurant was super crowded. There was a table top of 4 and the rest of us were across the aisle. The restaurant was exceedingly loud. Obviously there was no conversation between us. We came from 4 different states for this. We know our mistake was planning something of this magnitude here. Rolls were scarce at this restaurant. Our table of 9 got 7 rolls after asking multiple times. The 4 top got 3 after about 45 minutes. The 4 top got someone else's food order. They tried to make it do and then took part of the order away. So the steaks were cooked wrong. They tried to say one person ordered shrimp instead of strip steak. I guess it sounds the same(?). Our table got what we wanted. We had the kids. It's nice to keep kids quiet. My salmon tasted great. Service was very slow, but they were busy. All in all it was a very bad choice to have an 80th birthday party. Do something special somewhere quieter and smaller."}
{"text":"Went here the other night with about eight other women.  They crammed us into a booth and added a table.  It was tight.  Everyone ordered something different so it was fun to see what the food is all about here.    We started with fried dill pickles which were excellent!!!  They were nice and hot (temperature) and tasted great with the Ranch dressing.  I ordered the 6 oz. filet with two sides--baked potato and salad.  The salad came with lots of cut up hard boiled egg.  I really dislike hard boiled eggs, so there I was taking off all of the egg I could take off.  My error because the waitress asked if I wanted everything on it, and I said yes not realizing there was egg on it.  My steak was cooked perfectly.  The other meals (I'm so glad I didn't order!) were:  beef tips (smothered in gravy--ugh!), beef kabobs (chunks of meat looked really small), sirloin steak (too thin for my liking) and grilled chicken with bbq sauce (chicken looked dry).    Service was excellent.  And the waitress didn't add the tip in for the large group which is a good thing (in my opinion) because I always tip 20% or more which I did that night."}
{"text":"I have been to many different Texas Roadhouse's in many states.  I has been a favorite restaurant of mine for over a decade.  Went here for lunch with my wife and and we were both very very disappointed.  In a nearly empty restaurant they sat us across from a booth that had an extended table due to a party of 8.  This was unpleasant to get in and out of but not a deal breaker. Next, the service wasn't terrible but wasn't great.  We believe the waitress was having a bad day, which is understandable because we all have bad days.  The worst part was the steaks and meals.  These were not Texas Roadhouse quality.  These were the type of meal we would have expected from a family diner or a Cracker Barrel, not a steakhouse."}
{"text":"Our service at this location was great ! He was on top of our refills he brought us bread anytime it was empty, and food came out at a good time  I recommend asking for Mario he was excellent"}
{"text":"Packed Saturday night and I'm a single lady looking for dinner and a place at the bar.  Service was outgoing and genuine.  Ordered small filet.  Wonderfully flavorful and tender - would have expected a much higher price for this quality steak.  Baked potato could have used more stuff on top.  A little dry.  Bread was fresh and plentiful.  Salad was tasty.  Only downside...bar was too small for this busy of a place.  Could have been doubled in size and still full.  I'l go back to try some of the other other food."}
{"text":"Be sure to call ahead for a spot in line on weekends.  We had great service and the steaks were to perfection."}
{"text":"I have been to many Texas roadhouses all over the country and the food here and experience is about the same... Very good! Now you ask why one star, I took my family to this location last weekend and right off the bat a our waitress spilled a whole water in my dads lap.  Really not a big deal until our waitress started to act very irritated towards us and her service was really bad...By this point, we had enough and my wife asked to speak with the manger whom never stopped at our table to see how my dad was after getting drenched!  As it turns out the manager was never told, but my wife went on to tell him what a problem the waitress was and for no reason at all... She spilled the drink on my dad, she never brought his salad and when we told her she just said...oh!  Plus, she doesn't know anything about the food on the menu!  We were offered a discount on meal but we said no thx... Just wanted to let him know what he has working for him!  On a side note, the waitress working the other half of our party was awesome and very helpful!!!"}
{"text":"I usually love this restruant  but this was our first time at this location.  Our blooming Cactus came to us half raw and we sent it back. They brought us another one which was much better. Too bad it was 20 minutes later. The waitress said she was bringing me another drink too but that took 20 minutes too. The service was extremely slow for everything. However other than the first blooming Cactus the food was good."}
{"text":"Went to have dinner here last night with my family to celebrate the Union of my mother and her husband. With that said we checked in as there were many people waiting inside and outside to be seated. The hostess asked how many people we reply 10 adults 5 children. The hostess so 15, she explained that there was no table at this time where she could seat all of us together, but if we get on a waiting list she could make this happen, but the wait was an hour long, great we will wait since this place has great food, prides themselves in customer service. Let me just tell you after waiting over an hour we finally were seated in one area three different tables. This was explained to the person seating us that we waited so that 1. we could sit as a family 2. celebrate my mothers wedding 3. Who wants to sit away from there family on a joyous occasion. We asked to speak to the manger, we got Janelle. I highly doubt she was a manager nor a supervisor since her communication skills are lacking and eye contact is non existent. She only wanted to talk to the person who spoke with the hostess since her hostess makes it known that they cannot seat a family of 15 at one table, which was not verbally communicated to any of us at the time of check in and when the hostess stated she could seat us together, we as the customer should of known that  three or four tables in the same area is sitting together. Well that didn't sit well with me because I don't know how you do it in your family but when you go out to have dinner after waiting an hour wouldn't you expect to sit with your family. Her response was it depends. I laughed I said it depends she said yes and what would we like to do. I would like to sit with my family we came to celebrate, eat great food, and toast to this union. Thanks to Janelle that did not happen. We want to thank her for ruining our experience of waiting and not accommodating the customer nor did she apologize for the inconvenience, but stated that we were more than welcome to leave! Janelle we did just that, we left and went to another restaurant thanks to you! As I left I told her next time that someone speaks to her look at them in their eyes and make sure that she has some type of remorse and communication with the customer! she said thanks have a good night. Thank you Janelle representative of Texas Road House for your hospitality.   Also in case the family of 13 that were before us has not done so they were also rejected by Janelle."}
{"text":"Rattlesnake bites are awesome for an appetizer! They are battered diced jalepenos and pepperjack cheese, taste a little pimento cheese-ish... our meals were great, steak cooked medium rare perfectly. We ate at the bar, Robin the bar tender was super attentive despite being crazy busy. I was very impressed with her speed and attentiveness to everyone at the bar!!"}
{"text":"I'm impressed. We came here on Easter with a party of 5. Call-ahead seating worked how it's supposed to work (but rarely does in other places) and we were seated in a few minutes. Despite being incredibly busy, the service was excellent. We never had an empty glass, and each course arrived piping hot.   The 8 ounce sirloins were a perfect medium rare, the sides were well-prepared, and we had several baskets of freshly made rolls, all of them hot.   If this place does so well when slammed on a holiday, imagine how good they'll be on a normal day? Next time we're in town, we're definitely going to find out."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this place so obviously I like it.. Where are you going to get a steak, salad, and baked potato for under 10 bucks. Oh I forgot the fresh rolls are as good as you get anywhere.. This is not fine dining folks this is a place you go when you don't want to cook at home.. It's noisy, there are peanut shells on the floor, there is almost always a wait but don't forget your are getting a steak dinner for under 10 bucks.. The people who work there are very friendly and they give great service...They have feeding a lot of people at a very friendly price down to a science.. I go away for the summer to a place where there is no Texas Roadhouse and I really miss having them nearby..  If you don't like to wait, there is almost always a seat at the bar, which is where I almost always eat. There is an advantage to this, they put their best people behind the bar so you get great service. This is not a place where drunks go to drink, and most people at the bar are there to eat."}
{"text":"Prob one of the few chain restaurants I like coming to. Lots of free peanuts and oh so good bread and butter, they have a promo for Wednesday's where you can get an 8oz sirloin for the price for the 6oz, and my steak is always cooked perfectly.   Bonus they have good salads  And they line dance!"}
{"text":"We usually try to avoid chain steak houses as of recently. Mainly because for about ten or twenty dollars more, you can get a perfect meal at a real steakhouse. Had the day off today and after a 1.5 hour massage, Jen and I went looking for a place to eat. We wanted something new but settled on Texas Roadhouse after driving around aimlessly for fifteen minutes.   We got there just after opening and I remember telling Jen, since we both have restaurant backgrounds, that the worst time to eat at a restaurant is when it's slow. Two or three in the afternoon they are running on a skeleton crew until the night shift gets there and they are trying to cook, prep, and stock up all at the same time. Throw a steak on the grill or cheese sticks in the fryer and go grab some veggies out of the cooler to keep stocking for the dinner rush. Whoops! Oh man, I forgot the cheese sticks and they exploded or I forgot to flip the steak so one side is way over cooked and the other not so much. Yes, anyone who had worked back of the house will say that this or similar situations has happened to them.   We were sat right away with fresh rolls and cinnamon butter. Yummy!  Ordered the app sampler with boneless wings mixed sauce which were great. The potato skins were drowning in cheese and bacon and were probably the best I've ever had. Jen's chicken salad could have fed three more people. Massive. My steak was edible. I jinxed myself as you can see by the pictures. Burned on one side and barely marked on the other. Should not have been sent out but they probably had chicken to thaw or mushrooms to portion out. Our waitress was very fast and efficient and she did ask how everything was an I said it was fine. Just wanted to be done and get to our movie. It wasn't her fault the steak was cooked horribly. Typical reason though as to why I am willing to spend the extra money to get what I want. To me I just wasted $50. I could have spent $80 at Charleston's and been thoroughly satisfied."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for a very long time. We enjoy their steak and our kids have always enjoyed the options on the kids menu. Their bread rolls are awesome. The loaded mashed potatoes are the best."}
{"text":"I loved coming to this location because its close to the University that I attend. Western International. The steak and fully loaded baked potatoe are the best. I just love their atmosphere with the dancing waitresses. The peanuts all over the floor. Makes the place unique,"}
{"text":"My husband and I usually take our kids out to Texas Roadhouse when we want steak we love the butter cinnamon rolls and their salad. I like that they have the waitresses dance to country songs it goes with the environment"}
{"text":"I ordered to go from this location tonight and there was a small problem with my order. The manager came to me right away and told me what happened and made it right. This place has amazing food but now seeing the great customer service they have has made me a loyal customer. I will definitely be returning. Gotta appreciate a restaurant that works hard to make their customers happy. Thank you Kenna for being proactive and making things right. You made my night!"}
{"text":"We came here on a busy crazy Friday night with a toddler. Would recommend call ahead seating so the wait is shortened. Loved our waitress Jillian. We are some very hard people to please, but she put up with snarky attitudes and yelling kid. I love when a waitress can adapt and still work while bringing our drinks on the fast. We will be back and when we do we will sit in her section."}
{"text":"This place is always busy .. service and food is always hit or miss .. from good to great.. this place shares parking lot with another restaurant so parking is always packed (easier to park far and walk)..   On our recent visit we were offered the pickle chips or cactus blossom at the hostess stand as she was grabbing the rolls for our table .. smart move! We said yes and they arrived as our drinks were hitting the table!! That was fast!   Pickle chips were salty goodness.. ranch on the side .. plenty to share with a party of four.  My ribeye (10pz) was cooked med-well just like I like it.. my boyfriends was more on the medium side (pinker then he expected) but was juicy and delicious (so no complaints).   I had the baked potato and veggies (nothing exciting).. the bf had the chili and loaded potatoe .. the chili arrived before our entrees ..  Our waitress checked on us several times and the food runners were all friendly ..   That loaded sweet potato I saw on my out the door is on the list of must haves on my next visit .. it looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Service was REALLY slow but good food for the most part. I tried the skinny margarita and it was pretty good - just lots of ice (hence why it's \"skinny\" )  love the bread and butter. Also the front staff were very helpful"}
{"text":"Thank you Kristin and Steven for going that extra mile and making our party happy!! You guys have great customer service keep up the great work. Thank you for making my family and I feel very welcome and helping us in every way to make our experience at this restaurant so warming..."}
{"text":"Oh what to say about Texas Roadhouse? I mean,  listen...if you don't know what you're getting yourself into by going to Texas Roadhouse, then you probably deserve to be shocked and appalled by your experience here. However, most people know the general idea of da Roadhouse: moderately priced steak and BBQ with a very...relaxed atmosphere that would make a person with a peanut allergy go into anaphylactic shock. That being said, being a casual restaurant does not mean that your service should lag.  We came here for dinner because a couple friends were digging it.  Peanut shells aside (like I said that's their gimmick, so cool), the line-dancing thing is cool for the kids, but I found that it actually made it so that servers were even more distracted from their customers than they were to begin with with such a busy restaurant. Again, I totally get being super busy and forgetting things your customers ask for, but it seemed like everything was awry, from the kitchen to the actual dining area.  My steak was ordered medium and my friend's steak was ordered well done; however, when we received our meals, the steaks were switched.  In addition, each of us ordered salads, which came out last (very odd, no matter where you are).   Food was good--like I said, da Roadhouse does a fine job, as long as you know what you're getting yourself into. Don't come here expecting Fleming's. Anywho, you guys, I wouldn't recommend this place for a number of reasons that won't really interest the typical clientele of da Roadhouse. Too busy and lacking in basic common sense when it comes to customer service. Plus, I was not feeling the fact that their green beans automatically come with bacon on them. Yo, if you are going to put bacon on something, tell your customers.   Keep on keepin' on, Roadhouse customers...but don't come here if you want to get what you ordered in any kind of punctual manner. Holla."}
{"text":"This resturant is clean and has amazing customer service.  We came around 4:30 so we didn't wait very long.  We were waited on promptly.  Our food came out in a timely manner.   The food was awesome and the salads were served crispy on a chilled plate.  We loved this place. We will definitely be back.u"}
{"text":"beautiful west-style steak restaurant, love the environment but the space between seats and tables is too narrow. amazing rolls probably the best I've had so far. first served steak was bit over cooked but the next served were really yummy. mutton chops were just so good except that  they're too sweet. nice waitresses and affordable prices"}
{"text":"Great food! Very friendly staff. Country style atmosphere. Best ice cold mugs of beer and variety of margaritas!!! Delish!"}
{"text":"People should turn around and leave if they dont like what they see. Its basic either you like this type of steak house or you dont you can go across the street and pay 20 more dollars per steak if your into that kind of bullshit or you can pay 20 bucks for a hand cut 8 oz filet that is actually better quality then at the stupid fake upscale restraunts you find not naming and names but texas is also the first word in this places name. I had my steak cooked to a perfect medium my beer was far from flat and they have the octorberfest beer from sam adams which i love and there chili was amazing. The food was not salt heavy either. I wouldent say that this is kid friendly but then again there where kids there whatever the steaks are great"}
{"text":"Was there Sunday 1-22-17 . This is the third time there that the steak I was served was as tough as nails. I could not finish it. I go because my daughter and son-in-law like it. But this is the last time. I much prefer Outback. The service was great and the atmosphere is fun, but the food has gone down hill."}
{"text":"Great service, but very poor food. The steak was good, everything else was very xheap quality."}
{"text":"Love their ribs. The bread and cinnamon butter I could live on! A great idea is to add chili cheese to your side order of fries for $1.00. Much better than getting the whole appetizer which is always to much food. Our server this weekend was great. Very attentive and fast. The prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is one of my favorite places for a great rib-eye steak. They are friendly and i like how they treat veterans. They are usually pretty crowded so make sure you plan to be there a while. Sometimes longer than it takes you to eat your meal. And we actually got our meals in good timing. It's a good place to go for a family dinner."}
{"text":"Going to keep this review short and sweet.  I LOVE the bread here. I honestly don't think I have had better bread in my whole life and it is great to see that they make it in house. It was perfectly soft and sweet and still warm when it got to our table.   The main dishes are good, but nothing to rave about. For the price I think they are well worth it.  Overall - I would definitely come back and recommend Texas Roadhouse to my friends."}
{"text":"We love this place!!! Coming in for a baseball tournament and had no idea where to go have dinner and yelp brought us here. This place is fun and amazing food. Definitely good for us (family of 5)."}
{"text":"Read Kimberly's review...its pretty good....though a little dated so let me add to it.    I believe it truly IS still the same.  Really busy every night and getting a table will involve a wait.  I like their food when I'm in the mood for a 'chain' type restaurant.  However, like most of my reviews, I usually just pony up to the bar, get myself a beer, and grab a cheap sirloin.    The prices are reasonable, they have free peanuts, and the beer is super cold, all of these things I enjoy.  I used to go just to hang with a bartender that took my BS and dished it out but she has since moved onto Firehouse (Brittany in case you were wondering where she went).  I do wish TR would do some more fun things with their appetizer options cause sometimes that's all I'm in the mood for, but who am I right?  This would be a good family night place, where making a mess is acceptable and encouraged.  If your out with the gf / wife, I'd go to the bar area or try to get a table / booth near it."}
{"text":"Not impressed. It was dirty, peanuts all over the floor. Average Joes. Steak was cooked well, corn wasn't good, mashed potatoes were ok. Drink didn't have enough alcohol. Server was really good. The place is big but waiting time was quite long. Would not come back here, I rather go to Firebirds."}
{"text":"I come here all the time but wanted to make sure I went out of my way to write a review today because not only was our food SO DELICIOUS (it always is here though!) but our server Derek was AMAZING!!!! He was super attentive, never let our drinks get less than half-full, and made sure our appetizer arrived with plenty of time to finish it before our entrees came out! He had us laughing throughout our meal, and we will DEFINITELY be requesting him on our next visit!!!!"}
{"text":"Another wonderful night at Texas. When you just got to have a steak, none better for the money shy of doing it yourself. Speaking of good value, their drinks are just that great taste and good value. Rib kickers awesome and oh my goodness gracious that BREAD. Jonathan was great as well and had great timing without being in our faces."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and maybe I just come at odd hours, but I've never witnessed these dancing servers that everyone else mentions.  Also, it's never been all that loud.  It's definitely not a quiet restaurant, but I could make conversation with my table without even having to raise my voice.  Loud to me is having to yell at the person next to you, who still doesn't have a clue what you're saying.  For food, I've stuck mainly with the sirloin steak and the pulled pork.  Both are excellent, and I would definitely recommend them.  I end up taking at least half of the pork home, and it makes very good leftovers.  I prefer my pulled pork a little saucier, but it was no trouble to get some extra bbq sauce.  There's a lot more on the menu I'd like to try as well.  I'm not personally a fan of the peanut shells all over the floor, but the peanuts were nice the one time I had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Very ecstatic this Roadhouse opened in late October. We met for a guys night out before Christmas and had a party of 12. The staff were very accommodating and since we had a large party we had to be split into two tables, but were right next to each other.   The bread and butter spread is to die for and the chili is amazing. I got the dinner combo consisting of grilled BBQ chicken and a sirloin steak that came with two sides. I got chili and steak fries. It was all amazing. My buddies enjoyed their meals also.   Great location and awesome customer service. Cannot wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is just as good as any other Texas Roadhouses I have been at. Parking is plentiful, you can call ahead to be put on the list and service is impeccable. The food and drink are always good. I had the Combo of 6 oz sirloin and ribs with loaded mashed potatoes and fresh vegetables. The carrots and broccoli can be tricky to keep them just done enough to still be crunchy and they were perfect. My frozen Margarita was also well prepared. It's a fun atmosphere and the rolls with cinnamon, honey butter are worth the visit alone."}
{"text":"Great family night out! First we stopped at the one on Gilbert road but the wait was 30-40 minutes(with a 15 month old we were not waiting that long) so I called up this one, said the wait was only 10 minutes and they were able to put my name on the list over the phone!.  When we got there we only waited about 5 minutes, they sat us in a booth(awesome!) And the high chair even fit on the seat in the booth so it was out of the way and I got to sit right next to my little one! Loved that feature! Was craving ribs and they were awesome! Didn't feel rushed to order, we order drinks, then appetizer. We didn't order dinner until the appetizer came out, perfect timing not too much food at once.  No one had any complaints about the food! Great Sunday dinner out! And the waitress was awesome!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and the only reason I return is because I somehow keep ending up with gift cards for the holidays. The staff is always super friendly but the food is terrible. The last time we went my chicken was pink in the middle. With so many other decent places around I would move on and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Stew is a great bartender! Nice guy- shots are tight :( seriously would consider going elsewhere if you're looking for a fair shot- they toe it to the line -  Would probably recommend going somewhere where the bartenders have some flexibility. They say - add an extra shot (dbl shot) for $2 which is probably a regular elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ft Worth steak is so flavorful and delicious, also affordable  love coming here when craving some steak and fried pickles! Also the bread is the best."}
{"text":"Just as amazing as other Texas Roadhouses I've been too. Service was above and beyond at this location however, Chandlar was very accommodating and definitely had the skills and knowledge to serve us very well. Great location next to the major highway."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss. It seems that quality of food and service is dependant on how busy they are. Love their bread and cinnanom sugar butter (if they bring you some, they should but tonight they did not), fried pickles are always ordered (too greasy tonight), previous visits the country fried chicken is 10/10. Better to try this place when they aren't too busy so they can focus on quality."}
{"text":"Great service great food! We go here a lot and are never disappointed! Beer is icy cold, food is cooked as requested!   A little hard for parties larger than 6....they do have some spaces that accommodate 6-8.  2-4 is the magic number to get seated quickly."}
{"text":"The food was heavily salted, and I mean steak fries encrusted with salt... after sending back the porterhouse t-bone with onions, mushrooms and fries that were inedible , the waitress returned with the steak and offered to bring the rest of the meal later.  When food arrived later the steak was cold although they said it was recooked, the steak fries had bowls of sauce placed in the food... Now I personally don't want dishes thrown in the middle of my food .  Our waiter JB was polite and professional,  he needs to be hired elsewhere ... the female waitress and I presume manager who returned with food with another server was rude and he was a lier.  THEN my son found a long black hair in his food and vomited.  Will never return."}
{"text":"Consistent quality of food and service. I always sit at the bar with the other business travelers. You have to try the filet mignon salad....weeeeee doggies!  I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"We gave the restaurant a 6 month reprieve, and it was a mistake.  Our waiter had the personality of a cardboard box.  Our partner ordered an 8oz steak medium rare, and the photo demonstrates they couldn't get it right.  Save yourself the frustration and hassle.  Skip the dancing and country atmosphere and get your food cooked to order elsewhere.  Order accuracy continues to be a problem here!"}
{"text":"So happy to have a Texas Roadhouse in Tempe. Ordered the country fried steak with a side of rice and baked potato to go. The crew was very welcoming and had such a great attitude even threw in some extra rolls for me. I will def be back again!"}
{"text":"We went here for my first time on Monday. Average casual steakhouse atmosphere but the service and food was above that for sure. Very attentive and as we were seated we had our baked bread and cinnamon butter. The service as very friendly and attentive. Im usually skeptical with steakhouses because my meat is always overcooked and never a real delight. But I gave ordering a steak a shot and I was very glad I did. Got the 9oz sirloin and added grilled shrimp for $6 more. So much good with the sides and all that I barely touched my potatoes. The steak was perfectly cooked as was the shrimp. Topped off dinner with a skinny margarita, which was just as much as the shrimp but I was in the mood to splurge. He had a huge bone in steak I believe called the \"big hoss\" and was just as pleased as I was. All and all spent $50 with a lot of food and two alcoholic drinks. Not bad at all. Only complaint was the atmosphere and noise level, the kitchen is loud so asked to be seated away.  Will definitely go back when I have another $50 to drop on red meat!"}
{"text":"The competency of the staff was severely lacking. The first pinhead who spoke to my party, when we walked in, was ignorant of the procedures to handle a party greater than four. After a manager assisted in writing our name down, she informed us that we were to be seated. After a score and half minutes passed, we were still not seated. She then informed us that we were waiting for a family to finish before we could eat. While we continued to wait, the manager had the stroke of genius to announce out loud that the kitchen was to stop production of food. She herself, was the alpha of the chimpanzees. Eventually we had the bright idea to leave and go to Paradise Bakery across the street, an equally poor experience."}
{"text":"OMG! I love this location. My husband and I are both military veterans and I thought they only gave discounts on Veterans Day. Well when we were about to pay she saw my husbands military I.D. and said we could get a discount off our meal (winning). The service is always great, the food cooked to perfection, and the atmosphere is always family oriented when we go. We come to this location all the time and leave out with a full stomach, sleepy and satisfied. I will definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"Our server was awesome but the food was horrible, and what I mean by that is it wasn't very sanitary. I ordered a baked potato and when I was spreading my butter I noticed something hard and black in it. My husband took it out and cracked it open and it seemed to be a hard piece of mold. Management insisted that it was a burnt piece of steak and it obviously wasn't, i'm not too sure how a burnt piece of steak would end up in a container of butter, and besides, why would they allow anything to do with meat around dairy products during preparation, wouldn't that be a type of cross-contamination?? Never will I eat at this restaurant again, and I feel maybe they should be visited by a health inspector."}
{"text":"We were disappointed with our meal   We had a salad with grilled chicken-bland   And ribs.  The ribs were not very tender and tasty"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and it was clean and quick. The bartenders were all attentive and helpful. The food came out in a time fashion and EXACTLY how we ordered it. If you don't know about the rolls... get to know about it!"}
{"text":"Great food and plenty to save for later. Nice service to boot."}
{"text":"I love coming here because I'm a huge fan of their rolls & butter.  I usually come here for ribs when I'm in the mood and I absolutely love it. They are made just the way I like it - falling off the bone. You so get 2 sides with it and it's nice because there are a lot of sides to pick from.   The service is always great and the servers and very personable.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"By far the best Texas Roadhouse I have ever eaten at! Excellent service by all staff we encountered from the hostess all the way to the manger Carly on duty. Our server Ashley was amazing! Definitely will recommend to family and friends traveling this way! If my travels bring me back this way I will definitely stop by again! Nothing but deliciousness from the meal that I ate!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here very often! We love the food and the atmosphere. Usually service is alright. Tonight we came in for my birthday, we had Loren as our server. Can honestly say that it was the best service we have had since we have been coming in! She was super attentive, knowledgeable, and very friendly. One of our favorite places to come for dinner :)"}
{"text":"Just not the place it once was. Folks very nice brought us both another steak but just not that good! Edith fried  steak first one had white gravy that tasted like flour and second one with brown gravy is just not eatable. My first my streak was way too done for medium and second one was cooked fine but not that good I've probably never took home left overs for me but I'm sure our dog will love them both. Oh well times change"}
{"text":"I spend about 100$ a week at this location. Placed a to go order that was suppose to be ready at 725. At 740 I was finally given a refund. The manager just ripped the receipt out of my hand and stormed off. No explanation as to what happened to the food or why it was taking so long. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Extremely dirty place!!!  Server brought dirty plates, notify manager and she did not even apologized... what a shame!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was great but I couldn't say the same for interior. If you want to sit less than 14 inches away from the table next to you and have people turning sideways to get past the table and sticking their backside your way for an hour than this is your place. I can't believe each time we come it seems they squeeze more and more tables into the building. This will be our last time here. Bobby Q's has similar food, better atmosphere and your not sitting on top of someone else table. I am really disappointed that it's become a number game vs quality."}
{"text":"Great food and perfect for birthdays. My daughter loved getting on the saddle for a yeehaw!!!  Highly recommend the steaks with onions and mushrooms.   Peanuts are always fun too"}
{"text":"A-OK, not bad for what it is . That is to say it is a a chain restaurant that serves up decent food a t a good (low) price. I had the sirloin with grilled shrimp for about $15. No complaints. The steak was actually cooked to an honest medium as ordered. Compliments to the cook! The shrimp were cleaned properly and smartly seasoned. I sat at the bar for dinner and the service was great served with a smile and cold beer. Nice job!"}
{"text":"We were here in Easter Sunday. It was strange for us to be in a restaurant on a family holiday, but that's how the cards landed. And we were not alone. They were swamped!  We were seated quickly. Out came water and bread. Bread was delicious.   Order placed, Hubs had giant chops but was a little disappointed in flavor. \"A little bland\" was the  gravy report.   I had a lovely N.Y. strip that was done perfectly.   And the server waited until I cut into it before leaving. I love that idea. If it would've been wrong, no waiting for me. Also, if I would've gobbled it down and THEN claimed it was wrong, no food payment scene after the fact for them.   It was a busy afternoon at a busy chain on a busy holiday weekend. Their prices are fair and we were fed. Done deal, no surprises and everyone was happy."}
{"text":"Went to Texas Roadhouse at Metro Center Parkway today. Order prime rib dinner expecting deliciousness. Nothing but Extreme disappointment from the service to the food and our of wasted time and money will never return again! Not to mention they had Girl Scouts hustling cookies throughout the restaurant really? Should have ate them instead would have been better than my dinner."}
{"text":"Apparently, you either really like the Texas Roadhouse, or you really hate it.    We liked it--a lot.  We didn't expect this place to set the bar so high for a slab of beef, but this place KILLS Sizzler on both quality and price.  We thought that it even edged out other prominent steak places like Outback, Longhorn, and Black Angus for quality, while totally beating them in price.  Maybe we'll go there sometime and they'll suck, but they didn't this time.  Good service, great steak and great price--we will be back to Texas Roadhouse.  Just one warning--allergic to nuts?  Don't get within 10 feet of the door.  There's peanut shells everywhere."}
{"text":"We were seated right away at 8:00 PM when we walked in! Service by Genevieve was wonderful. She was pleasant & very accommodating. Started with the fried pickles w/ ranch, just okay. Got ribeye's & cooked the way we requested. Great job to the cooking staff! Always get with our side \"option\" the green beans there delicious!  Again all around good experience, all staffed this evening did a great job in running the restaurant well & with the  friendly service we received even better!"}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is a great place to have a decent steak. It is affordable and the food is well prepared. The staff is friendly and you just have to know going in there will be some whoop and hollaring for birthdays and anniversaries. It is not a high-end steak house, if that is what you are looking for, this is not it...it is a simple, affordable and consistent chain restaurant. We enjoy it."}
{"text":"Service was great, as always.  We were kept fully stocked with those famous rolls and our food came in a timely manner. The abundance of peanut shells near the entrance threw me off a bit as walking through them in sandals isn't the most appealing thing walking into a restaurant. Great location; not many restaurants in the area so it's nice to have some options."}
{"text":"Cockroach dropped out of the ceiling onto a plate, manager did nothing. Gross.  Group of 6 people, dining late on Sunday 4/8, when a cockroach dropped out of the ceiling onto one of the plates. Everyone freaked out, I hadn't even started on my steak, which then I couldn't eat....talked with manager, he didn't make any adjustments or apologies, unreal. Paid then threw my steak away. I think a call to the restaurant inspector is in order."}
{"text":"Overall best place to eat in CU. Good food, fast service, and good prices. Yes it's packed and you might have to wait awhile to get a table. There's a reason."}
{"text":"Well it was time to take the kids out to eat. They like the bread here so this was the choice today. To be honest, I love the bread here also. We ordered normal kid fare of Mac & Cheese and fries. I ordered veggie plate (I'm a vegetarian who eats at a steak house, weird I know). My salad was a wilted, but not too awful. The chicken and gravy the husband got was excellent in his opinion. He said a little too much gravy, but really that is not a complaint. The best part was the service. They were awesome today and I always appreciate that."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, awesome customer service! I came here for my birthday and celebrate my parents 48th anniversary. We had ordered the T-bone steaks 23oz and they were amazing cooked perfectly as I requested. They even give you free ice cream and seat you on a saddle to give you a shout out firvyour Birthday as other guest cheer for you! Haha I had forgotten my left over steak when I left. I come back 5 minutes later and it was already gone bummer! A manager said no problem we will make you a new one! That's just awesome! Thank you for making it a overall great experience. Would highly recommend them for great food and service."}
{"text":"Went here for date night and waited an hour for a table, it was like the air wasn't on and the place was jam packed and after the highly anticipated food came out my shrimp was not even hot, or even warm it's like the were sitting out and not cooked to order. What a disappointment that was. I let the waitress know and she brought me out new  ones but after eating the first ones I lost all my appetite. Bummer! We will be back I'm sure at some point because the rolls are delicious but won't be ordering the shrimp again!! Cold"}
{"text":"Where Can you go to celebrate a strangers birthday, Texas Road House, Buca, Peter Piper Pizza. I was involved in three birthday celebrations, I like to have fun when I'm out so I cheered people on.    As for my star rating, I would like to give four stars but the corporate feel always pulls my mouse towards the left  The last time I ate Texas Road House was in Phoenix.  I can say the restaurant delivers what it says it does. I haven't ordered the steak but I plan to come back one day, and give them a try, the ribs were satisfying.    So what is my review, well give this place a try for a corporate Texas feel.  The place has a dedication to serve high quality food and is ready to get you wasted in a family environment."}
{"text":"Fantastic service with very attentive bartenders. Great atmosphere, servers all work well together"}
{"text":"Took my mom here for her birthday last week and we had a fantastic time. ( the added fun of seeing her sitting on a saddle and being YEE-HAWED! By a room of patrons didn't hurt!)    But the food was very nice. Mom had the prime rib and swears it's the best she's ever eaten. I had the Tbone and was very pleased. The thing that puts the roadhouse at the top of my list however, was the perfect spicy bloody Mary from the bar. Soooo good.     Give them a try.... Try not to slip on the peanut shells."}
{"text":"They can't seat large parties due to the way the restaurant is set up which is a bummer. The bread and butter are to die for!! However, everything else on the menu is just okay. Ordered my steak medium and there was no pink whuch was a bummer but it took so long I didn't reorder. The prices are right though so if you want to eat steak for cheap this is the place."}
{"text":"The food is sooo good. Let's start with the free salted peanuts. You can throw the peels right to the floor. It's actually encouraged. Yes make a mess with a smile! I'm done. But I'll keep going. If you're a steak lover you gotta order yours smothered. Not only are the steaks juicy and flavorful but the are cooked to perfection. I've eaten in fancy steak houses in Vegas and they got nothing on Texas Road House. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Chicken tender and juicy, hamburgers are big and delicious, shrimp are succulent. All of the side dishes are to die for, BBQ beans, corn, sweet bread with cinnamon butter, mash potatoes, Caesar Salad, and loaded baked potato are all amazing. The full Bar has the best margaritas. I can't say enough good things. I've been eating here for over 10 years and the staff is always friendly and helpful. Where it's a romantic date or a family dinner you will have a great finger licking time. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service and decent prices! They know how to work with large parties and even with such a large group coming in they stayed on top of their game keeping us happy and keeping the food and drinks coming!"}
{"text":"Two stars because our waiter was fantastic and our steaks were good, despite the...... Long wait time, plus broken pager so we waited an extra 15 min. Total wait time 35 min! Don't order the skinny lime margarita it was like pouring straight lime juice in your mouth- it's less than 200 calories because you can only have one sip. Orders were wrong and service took forever. Won't be back EVER! I hope our super kind, apologetic waiter finds a new job- and gets all our tip! He deserves it!"}
{"text":"2nd time is not the charm.  I visited this Texas Roadhouse about 6 months ago and it has not improved.  Yes, the service was great but the food was again disappointing.  I had the half slab of ribs with shrimp.  They advertise their ribs as tender, juicy and falling off the bone.  They fell off the bone but it was because they were burnt and dry.  I was there at 5:30 in the evening so there was no excuse.  The shrimp was under cooked and all you could taste was the butter and garlic.  I did have a great experience though.  It was their rolls.  Outstanding.  I have heard many complaints about the way they over cook their steaks and how tasteless their sides are.  I agree.  Too many good steakhouses around town to settle for this overpriced place."}
{"text":"We visited this location last week for my son's birthday.  Being a native Texan and having visited TR restaurants a number of times there, I was excited to see if the AZ locations were equally as good.  This location did not disappoint.  Our party ordered fried catfish, chicken tenders, the filet & shrimp, & salads.  Everything was delicious....just as tasty as I remembered and our server did an excellent job with our large party.  We were obviously not the only ones to enjoy this restaurant as there was a lengthy wait at the front door as we were leaving the restaurant.  I would recommend call ahead seating if you plan to visit!"}
{"text":"All I ask for is good food and good service. This place had friendly & attentive service and awesome food! YES!!!!   The wait was about 5-10 minutes on a Saturday evening. The hostesses greeted us with a friendly smile. Peanuts available from a large barrel while you wait, toss the shells on the ground?   I don't care much for chain restaurants, but this place had reasonable prices for delicious steaks and ribs. You can order a combo or add ribs or grilled shrimp to your entree for an additional cost. The food was fantastic! The salad dressing is made from scratch, not from a bottle. They offer fresh rolls. Our food arrived on time.   What a fun overall ambiance too! Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Always get my order right are friendly and priced alright. I usually find myself tipping pretty decent because I frequently have a good experience because yes I go there that much lol the beef tips meal is good try that :) lol and they totally hook you up on that bread before your meal they won't skimp hahaha"}
{"text":"Had Mother's Day lunch did the call-ahead. It was great had Martin as our sever he was VERY Attentive for be busy great service! Very personable"}
{"text":"Overall steak is great, moist and delicious. Sides were good I had sweet potato, honey butter on the side and seasoned rice. Honey butter rolls were a little over baked still pretty good but I like bread. Gabriella was my waitress she was attentive and nice attitude. This has become my go to place for steak please get some regular chicken wings and this will become the SPOT!!!"}
{"text":"Can only review on the drinks. Cabernet not so tasty and on the expensive side. Blue Moon ok. That being said, the house is full and all look happy. Everyone spoke and all have a smile. Free parking is always a plus. Looked at the menu and it is reasonably priced so a family can dine, have fun and not break the bank."}
{"text":"Have made it a point to visit a Texas Roadhouse at least once when traveling. Some have been eh, this one was not one of those.  We had Haley as our server and she was incredible. When we were seated she was at our table promptly and cheery, which after a day of driving is a nice thing to see.  She took our drink order and informed us she had a large table and wanted to make sure we didn't wait too long and asked if we were ready.  This was very much appreciated as I have been places where the server has those tables but doesn't tell you and disappears.  Even with the large table, her service was top notch and our drinks (or rolls) were never empty.  The only reason I didn't give this visit 5 stars is that the still have to figure out accuracy in the call ahead/online seating.  I checked in online and got there at the end of my window and sill had to wait about 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"They DANCE FOR YOU!!!!!  How is that not awesome!?!?!??!!!  Booooooooo!!!!!....!!!!!.....!!!!....  To whoever gives this place a low rating! Granted... The weekend staff is a bit different than the weekday staff. Some people definitely are there just because \"it's a job\".  You get that wherever you go though. I'm sure everybody can pretend to be happy in place where everyone makes $30/hr just for smiling and serving people...........  This is not that place. It is awesome though."}
{"text":"You know I have been to a few Texas roadhouses and it was for a while one of my favorite places to dine. I think the atmosphere was fun and different. Tonight was not so much. I travel often with someone who is disabled. As a result I try to find the best spot for them so its easy for them to get in and out. As we drove up we saw that someone who, though they did have a handicapped placard, was actually double parked in two parking handicapped spots and thusly taking up the remaining spots by the front door of the building. We had to park in one spot on the side of the building which was not enjoyable. We walked in and told the hosts who then got the manager. Who apologized and seemed semi reluctant to take down their plate number. So Then we were sat. And waited and waited and waited and waited. As we waited I noticed that behind us at a table of five or so a server was sitting with the group and talking. I was close enough to pick up that it seemed like they were friends, maybe family, and that something unfortunate had recently happened. I know I should not have heard that but they were right behind me and I was trying to see if that was our server. Anyways... so we waited. And guess what... that server sitting talking was our server. She finished her conversation. got up said she would be right with us and walked by. then came back... and took our drink orders. Then finally our food orders. I ordered a hamburger medium well a little pink. I got the burger and after a bit or two realized that there was a line of pink that took up the entire middle of the burger.. it was pink from center to edge. That's not medium well. So i said to the person I was with... o let me find the server... Where was she? Behind me talking again and again and again. So eventually i did something which is call over another server to try and get my order fixed. Since she was right behind me she heard me and immediately got up and took my burger to fix it. This after waiting what I think was nearly five minutes for her to finish talking and check on her tables. When she brought the burger back she acted like i did not know what Mid well is.... Ma'am I am going to be a health inspector... If you think I do not know what a mid well burger is let me go back into your Kitchen and we will see how many violations we have back there.... Maybe I did no describe it right but there was a lot of pink in that burger.  Wondering what happened with the person double parked? So were we. When asked the manager said she was still searching.  Ehhh nooo sorry... the manager was also sitting at the table behind us talking.  And I saw her walking around. Look if they did not have an intercom system and she had to go table to table and ask that would have taken a while. She did not do that. She said o I am keeping an eye out. No when someone says something like that you go table to table asking who owns this car or you call the police. Double parking especially in a handicap spot is rude and totally inconsiderate. I and the person I was with have both seen situations like this handled with a lot more assertiveness in the past. I wish I could give a better review but I can't thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"Great service! I was concerned when I saw the first reviews. ..but I'm so glad I didn't listen. This a fun place with happy friendly servers. Our food was prepared exactly as we asked. Everything tasted great. We had Kiersten  as our server and she was awesome. She was personable and she made sure we had everything we needed. Be smart we have the app on our phone and call ahead seating. This is a popular place and brand new so it's  going to be packed."}
{"text":"Great food inexpensive for what you get it's a good time! They must have a new crew and management as things have turned around here for the better."}
{"text":"We recently moved to town and, in spite of the fact that it's our anniversary, don't have a babysitter yet. Neither, for that matter, do we have a grill. So we wanted a kid-friendly, reasonably priced steak house and this absolutely was exactly what we were looking for. With much better cuts of steak than other comparably priced steak houses and cheap kids meals (about $4 each), we were all pretty happy. Our server Jami was attentive without being intrusive and was generally exactly what you want your server to be. My only complaint is how salty some of the food was (which wasn't really a problem for me but would be for those with hypertension problems). We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered 10 oz ribeye combo with shrimp and a sweet potato as a side. My girlfriend ordered ny strip with loaded baked potato. Great tasting steak and cooked to perfect temp. The bread you get with meal are so addicting"}
{"text":"Best rolls and great service. Last night when we left there was an accident in the parking lot. Young lady said she just dropped off boyfriend at work there at Texas Roadhouse. Boyfriend was there picking up parts off the road so no one would get a flat tire from the accident along with his father. He commented he is late for work to help his girlfriend and my husband said I can help your father clean up if you need to go into work and he replied Texas Roadhouse said he can take as much time needed to help girlfriend. I thought that's great management looking out for employees. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to sit at the bar on a busy night. We enjoyed the hand cut steaks and delicious side items. The Sirloin was very tender and the New York Strip was hearty yet tender. The best thing about Texas Roadhouse that beats out their competition is the food is made in house, the steaks are cut in house and the service is personalized. For the money it's a better choice for a cheap night out for steak."}
{"text":"Eddie has been our server the last couple times and has been absolutely wonderful! Will definitely be returning. :)"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my visit to this location last night. My husband and I are huge Texas Roadhouse fans. The food is always great, which is why we continue to go back. We got there at 7 PM and the place was packed, as usual. We don't mind waiting. We were told it would be about a 30-40 minute wait. That's ok. It wasn't until we had waited 50 minutes that I asked the host about how much longer it would be. We weren't exactly in a time crunch but we did have movie reservations for later on in the evening. After 10 more minutes of waiting, we were seated. Our server, Laci, was very nice but VERY slow. We sat another 10 minutes waiting on her to greet us. By that point, we knew what we wanted and requested that she take our whole order. My drink and our appetizer came out in a timely manner. Both were delicious. Our steaks then came out. Prepared close to perfect. No complaints. Laci checked on us once. We finished our meal and sat, and sat, and sat. Laci was nowhere to be found. By that point, it was after 9 PM and we had been in the place for over two hours. We finally tracked her down and asked that she go ahead and run our card. We didn't even look at the check. She came back ten minutes later with our boxes and receipt. Needless to say, we were very late to our movie that I had reserved and our night was sort of ruined. I understand that it was a Saturday night and the place was busy, but it should not have taken over an hour to dine when we placed our order upon being greeted. I may give this location one more chance. I will probably save my time and go to Matthews."}
{"text":"Menu had variety , not just a typical steak menu . Good portion sizes , flavor was just right , prices were good considering the amount of food you receive . Sides are well seasoned too so everything was yummy . Comes with a complimentary bread basket with Apple butter as a starter as well."}
{"text":"The server (Derik) was attentive but he was working hard to up-sell us throughout the meal (Drinks, Smothered Steak, Loaded Baked Potato, etc). Sadly, he was more worried about getting the up-sell than taking the order.  So, although I ordered my steak medium rare, they brought it medium well. I kindly sent it back to the kitchen for another. By the time my new steak arrived (18 minutes later) my family had finished their meal.   The server apologized for the mix up but there was no offer to comp our appetizer or any other token of their sincerity. Basically, they didn't care that I sat for nearly 20 minutes watching my family eat their dinner. Then, my family got to sit and watch me eat my dinner for another 10 minutes.  Not a great experience, we'll go to Outback next time we want steak."}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my family for as long as I can imagine. This place has a close spot next to my heart and this past visit was no different. Once you enter, the whole floor is covered with peanut shells. Don't fret, this is normal here. Texas offers complimentary peanuts while you wait for your table.   While you walk to your table, you are able to choose your own steak. Once you get to sit down, you're blessed with their signature dinner rolls with cinnamon sugar butter. Oh man, let me tell you about their rolls. I generally avoid carbs (you know, gotta try to stay healthy) but when it comes down to these suckers, I finished a whole basket and asked for seconds. They always come hot and the cinnamon spice in the butter is a nice touch.  My family always order the fried pickles as a starter. They taste better than most places I have ordered them. The pickles are always fried til they are crispy but still juicy in the inside. Now, onto the entrees. My mom loves ordering the prime rib but sadly it is only available on the weekends. I order myself a ribeye, cooked medium rare. When the steak came out, it was cooked as close to medium rare as I could ask for. A problem that commonly occurs in chain steakhouses is that they always overcook their steaks. Texas does not have this problem and I applaud them for that. However, the steak had a bit too much fat for my taste. Therefore, I had to cut out about a fourth of the steak and was left with less steak then I would wish for.  I have never tried their desserts as we are generally too stuffed to order them. Maybe next time, I will give it a try. For the price of their entrees, I would consider them a bargain. For less than twenty bucks, you get a good chunk of steak, 2 sides, and all the dinner rolls your heart desires. Will I come back? Of course! While the quality of the steak is subpar, what keeps me coming is the server's good attitude and the dinner rolls. Maybe next time I'll ask if I can just order a dozen of their rolls to go."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to have dinner for first time there,the attention when you come in was good .The service awesome,I did forgot the waitress named she did great,the food was perfect.We will come again more often,"}
{"text":"You can pick out your steak for them to cook when you first walk in the door. For drink I ordered the Sangria Margarita. It came in a nice size fish bowl and was yummy, I ordered it with a shot of patron. What a great price, only $2.00 extra for the shot. I didn't eat the rolls as I had already reached my carb limit for the day as far as bread goes. That didn't stop me from ordering a 11 Oz. Hearty Cut of their USDA Choice Sirloin* Medium Well plus corn and sweet potato topped with marshmallow. My date ordered chicken fried chicken with a Caesar salad and cup of chili. We both enjoyed our meals with no complaints at all. Came out in a timely fashion, our server was great, we left a higher than normal tip for her. We were surprised to see our bill was only $41 so you know we will be back. There's 3 or more steak houses in a row in this neighborhood and we have tried Black Angus but they are more expensive than Texas Roadhouse. We enjoyed the value and bang for our buck here."}
{"text":"Loved it!!!!! It was tasty and enjoyable for our family. It's a kid friendly atmosphere. The wait time was decent. We loved the starter bread... BEST BREAD EVER!!!!!!! It was awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent. Great service, timely, great flavor. Steak absolutely melted in my mouth. Love the rolls & cinnamon butter."}
{"text":"How can you not love the 24 ounce porterhouse steak the seasoned rice and the atmosphere here everything about this place says Texas and sports ..oh might I add the peanuts you eat and just eat messy..what's better than that come on in"}
{"text":"So I come from Northern California and there's a Texas Roadhouse in my hometown that I love so when I moved here this was the first thing I recognized. Unfortunately that is where the similarities ended.  I came here on a Wednesday night with a friend. so it was relatively quiet. We were sat right away so we were off to a good start. It took our waiter about 15 minutes to get bread and water to us and take our drink orders.   We were a bit confused but we gave the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe there was something going on in the back of the house. After bringing us bread and our drinks we ordered appetizers. The appetizers took 20 minutes to get to us. If it was super busy I would have understand. After the appetizers being brought by a separate staff member we asked for our server so we could order.  After about 5 minutes we started looking around trying to locate him. He was standing at the bar watching a baseball game.  A little annoyed we waited for the middle of the inning and he came over. I ordered some ribs and chicken. When they arrived, the Rib's were good, chicken was cooked nicely. Green beans were my side and they were stone cold. I asked them to be reheated or sent back and get new ones, whichever is easiest. They arrived as the check arrived, still cold. I was beyond annoyed and just all around fed up.  I will not be coming back to Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"We went to this chain restaurant many people waiting but despite this the wait was not so long the waiters very nice and after seeing and rereading the menu we were ready to order. There was our mistake, we ask to order an appetizer and also the main dish at the same time  Then they brought us the main dinner first and they totally forgot about the appetizer also my husband order as a side order a bake potato which he didn't get it and I need to reorder again to a different server ."}
{"text":"Today, June 28, 2018, I was thoroughly disappointed with my visit to Texas Roadhouse.  I called in a pickup order of the Chicken Critter Salad w/o bacon.  I chose the honey mustard dressing and asked for an extra small cup of the dressing, and I ask for fresh rolls.   The reason I was disappointed is the rolls were old; at least three days old.  They were stale, cracking and hard to bite into.  They were not the fresh buttery rolls I saw on the counter as I walked in the door.  Also, this was a togo order and they did not provide me with eating utensils.  Lastly, they did not provide the additional cup of honey mustard.  I believe the restaurants in the Charlotte and Concord areas sometimes employ people who intentionally mistreat Blacks because this is not the only negative review I am going to complete this week.  Why were my rolls old and not fresh?  I contacted the restaurant to try to explain my disappointment.  When they transferred me to the owner she continuously interrupted me, and discredited my disappointment.  I will NEVER eat again at this restaurant.  I have eaten at Texas Roadhouse for years (starting with the one in Atlanta near Busby Parkway.  That one was consistently AWESOME.  But this particular one in Concord N.C. has repulsed me with their service of the food, and the owner's attitude."}
{"text":"awesome service great food fantastic drinks will be back for sure !!! fun environment!!!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and atmosphere, we went here with friends from out of town and the service was great."}
{"text":"I have experienced better than Texas Roadhouse.  I came here after a recommendation from one of my co-workers. We started off with the butter rolls which were delicious. They had a cinnamon butter which was decadent and very tasty. We got the Cactus Blossom for an appetizer which is very similar to a Bloomin' Onion from Outback, just not as big. The dipping sauce it came with was very good.  For an entree, I got a half slab of ribs with mashed potatoes and a cup of chili as my two sides. My partner got a 6 OZ sirloin steak with the same two sides.  The ribs were disappointing. You can tell that they are reheated and they become overcooked because of this. They are not fall of the bone as they say they are, you really have to pull those ribs apart and when you do, the meat is stringy and chewy. I had to pick apart the ribs and I only ate the parts that were not overcooked. The mashed potatoes were not my favorite, I had maybe two spoonfuls of it.  My partner's steak was cooked well, but it was nothing to write home about. It was still a little chewy although he got medium rare and we had to use the steak sauce that's on the table to give it some flavor.  Our cup of chili never came, so we asked to get it to go and our server was kind enough to give us our appetizer for free.   I am not sure if we came to the wrong Texas Roadhouse at the wrong time, but we were not impressed, and a little bit disappointed towards the end. I don't think we will be giving this place a shot any time soon."}
{"text":"This has been the best restaurant i went on my trip to phoenix this time. Their rolls are to die for and really addicting. My ribs were so delicious and tender and the service was amazing, they kept bringing rolls and drinks everytime we were done with it and took time to ask if everything was good and the servers even did a little line dance, i kinda thought it was very cute and funny lol. Its just nice to see such a friendly place since i'm from canada and you know how it's here eh? I will surely come back next time i come to phoenix."}
{"text":"Solid experience at Texas Roadhouse (late december/early January). My rib eye  was made as ordered (medium), the service was excellent, and I left satisfied with the overall experience.   The ambience is loud and festive, however I easily could carry a conversation. It's a great place for young people, people with kids, or other loud talking adults. The Christmas decorations were fun, spirited, and did not take away from the Texas Roadhouse theme.  The service was friendly and prompt. They danced around for someone's birthday and they seemed to enjoy their job, which is hard to find these days.  The food was yummy and I enjoyed my rib eye, mashed potatoes, and Cesar salad. The dressing is apparently made in house, tasted good. Next time I would ask if they could add tomatoes to the Caesar though. They give complimentary bread and peanuts.   This isn't a fancy, organic Kobe beef upscale steakhouse. It's a solid family joint and if you know what to order you will have a good time. The first time I came here I ordered smothered chicken and so I'd suggest you stay away from that! Also, I was in a rather calm mood and was not having the loud noise. Make sure you're up for the steak and a festive time, otherwise you may not have the optimal experience provided."}
{"text":"Service was great. The food was fresh and hot. The place was very busy but our wait was only 4 minutes or so to be seated. Our waitress was prompt and very friendly. Everything was just as we ordered and the wait for our food wasn't very long. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Our server Kristen was very nice and she deserves the 3 stars. I was ver disappointed to find out after we ordered that they did not have any prime rib, which is why I come here, at 615pm on a weekend. I asked Kristen if there was anything close to prime rib and she suggested ribeye.  My ribeye had more fat that I desired on it.  The food was also brought to us less than 5 min after our salads were delivered.  This made the temperature of our food cold by the time we finished our salads.  Unfortunately I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"When being seated we were taken past 2 booths set and ready for guests and brought to a terrible table beside the entrance to the kitchen.  When I requested a different table the hostess took us back to the front of the restaurant and we were placed back AT THE END of the waiting list.  Why would you make the guests start the process all over again? Seems that Texas Roadhouse wants people with a reasonable request treated like a naughty child.  No wonder a couple of the guest's in front of us got mad and walked out when the confused hostess staff botched their entry experience."}
{"text":"We started eating before we were at our table.  We helped ourselves to the roasted peanuts that seem to be everywhere in this restaurant.  The peanuts are roasted just right and have just enough saltiness.  When we were seated we were brought some hot rolls fresh out of the oven.  They were so hot and fresh that we could barely pick them up.  They were served with room temperature butter - perfect for spreading - that had been mixed with a touch of cinnamon-sugar and I enjoyed 2 of these rolls.  I next got a salad as one of my side dish choices.  I chose a Caesar salad.  They put out a rather nice Caesar salad.  I found the dressing to be flavorful but not overwhelming with fishiness as some Caesar dressing can be.  I ordered a Blue Moon ale which they have on tap.  It is a nice, full bodied lager which I found quite satisfying.  The main course arrived and I enjoyed my second side item, baked beans.  They were somewhat heavy on BBQ sauce but made with hearty beans and plenty of chunks of flavorful pork.  Oh, they also brought out a slab of ribs, about 16 bones.  I ate one.  It was tender and delicious.  I'll eat the rest of the ribs tomorrow."}
{"text":"I usually stay away from chains but I offered to take an employee out for dinner and this was the pick.  I was surprised at the quality of the food.  I don't eat steak so I got the ribs.  I had to eat them with a fork.  Literally falling off the bone.  That's a good sign.  The atmosphere can best be described as Neuvo Bubba decor.  I've actually been to a real Texas roadhouse (Post, Texas and I did in fact make eye contact with most of the patrons) and this is cleaner (despite the peanut shells everywhere) safer (despite the Helter Skelter look from dude in the Lynyrd Skynyrd T-shirt) and tastier (still mostly fried)."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and the service and food were very good! I do wish the rolls would have been hotter but they were still good. I ordered the beef tips and they were great! We will be back soon for another dinner!"}
{"text":"This location is always packed when we go around 6-7pm. Usually it's a 45 minute wait on average. I'm not sure why they don't build another one in the Goodyear/Avondale area. The staff is always friendly and the food is always great. This location is too loud for my liking. It seems everyone is having a birthday and the staff is just way too loud when singing. One waitress was so loud that I had to cover my ears 4 tables over. That says something since I have terrible hearing from working around aircraft. They do give a military discount."}
{"text":"A full five stars for my waitress. And because someone in the kitchen knows how to cook mushrooms correctly! Great service."}
{"text":"Such good food for such good price. Waitresses are friendly and if they drop your food, you get 15 dollars off! But seriously best ribeye steak I have ever had."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 5 star mostly because of the service we got this last time. Baile was our waitress this time and she was the most pleasant server I've ever encountered. Very attentive and detailed with everything. We didn't feel rushed like we normally do when we come here by other servers. She made recommendations and did the whole service to her standards. Which really shows. She's great and some of the other servers could take a few lessons from her honestly. As long as she's working I'll definitely be back for that A+ service and great food!"}
{"text":"Not a country fan or of gimmicks in restaurants. however, I'll never step foot in a different steakhouse. bone in ribeye is delicious, always get a loaded potato(easy salt) and veggies. lasts 2 meals because of the free bread and cinnamon buter. ask for some rolls to go, eat half the meal. bam, 2 meals. I suggest rare to medium rare if you wanna do this so you can reheat. great service, can be slow when busy but that's a full house, what do you expect?"}
{"text":"My Children loves this place. if there's a special occasion, you know that all they want is this place....AWESOME....Steak and the bread yummy."}
{"text":"Ive never left a review especially a bad review... I understand things happen but I am not happy with my visit at all tonight. Starts with the restrooms where disgusting and I find it horrible service when you walk into the restrooms before even being seated and you have multiple employees standing in the restrooms up against the sinks on the cell phones texting/fb whatever it may be. Then you walk into a stall and there is nothing but urine all over the top of the toilet seat and the ground is all weat around it. But let's get to the rest of my horrible visit.  My husband, myself, one of our friends, my younger brother-in-law, and his friend went into eat tonight around 8:20ish at the champaign location. We walked in with there not being very many people in the dinning area. We were seated at our table and told that they would bring us some rolls. My husband, our friend, and myself ordered drinks that our waiter NEVER I.D. FOR....... Needless to say 5-10 minutes or so went by, we still didn't have any rolls or any plates to put any rolls on. My brother-in-law finally went up to the front and asked them for some rolls with the waiter finally coming to our table and saying that he is very sorry everybody in the building has worked a double today. (Again we understood) As they only gave us small basket with less rolls then people we had in our group....whatever we let it go. Our waiter comes and takes our order finally.... again another 40-45 min wait....when it's Sunday night and they close at 9:00.... (REALLY BUSY) we finally got our food. About this time until the time we got done eating there was two bus boys in the area that had swept the same part of the floor for 20 minutes, like it was a reason to stay in our area and check stuff out. After getting our food, I had to ask for ranch again with my cheddar/bacon fries with a side of RANCH that I had ordered to begin with from some other waitress standing in the area. My little brother-in-law had ordered the pulled pork dinner, with sides of a baked potato with cheese and bacon, and WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FRIES..... loaded with cheese and bacon.... his plate had the pulled pork, a baked potato with cheese and bacon, and a CUP WITH CHEESE AND BACON.... never any fries. Instead of complaining because it was after closing and we were half way done with our food we continued to eat and go on with our dinner. Our waiter brings us our ticket for $91.27... my husband and I paid for the ticket for all of us.... get our to go boxes, and leave at this time being about 9:30ish. We left get over to thortans gas station on Mattis when our friend of ours that was with us realized that he didn't have his wallet and he left it sitting on the table where we ate our dinner. We then left thortans and went straight back to Texas roadhouse only being gone for a matter or 3-5 minutes. As we approach the door and not being able to get in because it was after 9:30 when we left the first time obviously... the one last set of customers was walking out the building that let us in. We went in and approached the waiter that we had and asked him if anyone had seen the wallet we had just left on the table.. he said no he hasn't seen anything as they went over and looked the table was already cleared off, wiped down, and set with new dishes. He went straight under the table where the wallet was at and hands it to him. As our buddy walk out comes out to the car with his wallet he opens it and all the $$$ he had in there was gone.. we went back up to the door AGAIN knocking and knocking and knocking finally a hostess answered the door and went and got the manager. As the manager comes out and we explain to her what happens she takes me in there and I show her which ones where hanging around our table for ever \"Cleaning.\" She supposedly took them to the back and searched them coming out saying she found nothing ... yeah because they DONE TOOK THE MONEY AND HID IT IN THE BUILDING SOMEWHERE,  she then throws a business card at my husband and tells him to call the distract manager and slams the front door in our faces. After the cops show up and tell us that basically we are shit out of luck and they won't pin point who it is because someone hid the money they stole, and the hostess and waiters/waitresses lied and said we found the wallet and pulled it from under the table when it wasn't us it was our waiter that \"found it\" and pulled it from under the table. The manager saying she won't even refund the $91.27 +tip I spent on food. It was the WORST EXPERIENCE I've EVER had in my lifetime at a restaurant from the employees, to the managers, go the cops sticking up for them... I WILL NEVER EVER BE BACK. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE $180 + MEAL TONIGHT!!!!!! One of them employees is responsible for taking the $90 out of a wallet that they SHOULD OF NEVER OPENED.    I know I am forgetting stuff to add in there..  But NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN....."}
{"text":"Probably the best service I have had in a great while!  Sat at the bar and Sarah and Abby were a well oiled machine!  Happy, outgoing, and very helpful!  I will definitely be back... The steak was delicious, the mushrooms were melt in your mouth, and the baked potato was done to perfection!  I travel to the Charlotte area a couple times a month... Didn't realize that this place was so great!  Packed on a Tuesday night, but quick and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Don't be apprehensive about going to this restaurant if you are vegetarian. They offer a great vegetable plate made up of four side dishes of your choice. Beware, though, the green beans contain bacon. The fried pickles were great with a light crisp coating. I plan to eat here often. The service is prompt and efficient."}
{"text":"57 mins and still no food???? Oh but my waitress does have time to fraternize with her boyfriend, hopefully when they are done she will comeback with less attitude. SUBPAR service! We are regulars at a different location and never have to deal with this crap. I assume poor management at the west side store is the reason for such poor service.  At last he food arrived and the order was taken WRONG!!!!!!! I would expect nothing less!!!"}
{"text":"The steak and salmon were delicious, however, we decided to try Granny's Apple Classic dessert. The Apple pie was fine as was the vanilla ice cream. The sweet topping poured over the top was gelatinous and just covered the entire dessert. Might be a good idea to put that on the side."}
{"text":"We normally go here for dinner we love this place but today was not one of those good days. We got a guy by the name of Kenny this is he second time he helps us out the first time I thought it was cuz he was buzzy but we got him again today and same thing happened. He never came around to give us refills till we asked someone else. We wanted more rolls we asked him he said yes I'll bring some well he didn't he came back o take our order and said ohh I'll bring the rolls he didn't we asked someone else then that's when Kenny came with the rolls. I didn't like his service at all. Then when we hot our food my husband ordered bone in ribeye this steak is expensive OK and it had more fat then anything it was nasty we go to a restaurant for a steak not for a ball of fat. I was disappointed. I took a picture if they need to see it."}
{"text":"I Have visited this location about 3xs since open and out of all the locations (which I have tried) this one has the best customer service. I love the Happy Hour prices. The food is amazing. I tried the shredded pork for the first time every and it was amazing. Of course everyone need to get the onion blossom. It's one of the best I have tried. Great job on adding this location. I don't have to travel 30mins anymore to others locations. I might add I will probably become a regular here."}
{"text":"Yeehaw! I wasn't really looking forward to yet another pseudo country style eatery, but was deliciously surprised the minute I sat at the bar and started cracking open the bucket of peanuts and sipping on some Samuel Adams beer. Looks like they always have a few Sams on tap spanning lighter to darker so that's good for starters. Daily early bird specials for $9.99 have 11 entrees to choose from and lots of choices for the sides. Doughy warm rolls started the meal and they weren't microwave re-heated but fresh out of the oven so the texture was more homemade so the butter was sopped up. Sirloin steak was cooked exactly as I'd ordered it: medium rare and just the way the menu described \"warm red center.\" All their salads have made from scratch dressings and my Caesar had fresh, not powdery shaken from a green tubular box Parmesan, something not seen much anymore, and such a tasty difference. Real mashed potatoes too. Little child nearby was sitting on a saddle chair and was obviously having a very special time. Mood in the restaurant was very positive with lively conversing all around and waitstaff seeming to enjoy their work. I can hardly wait to go back and work my way through those $9.99 specials, and then start exploring the other menu sections...."}
{"text":"Normally we enjoy Texas Roadhouse.  Unfortunately today must have been the wrong day to go.  We ordered two steaks and sides.  One was requested to be medium well and was brought out as  charred dry charcoal.  The other was requested to be medium rare and had only a sliver of red down the center.  Both where pretty flavorless ass well.  They did offer to cook new ones but after waiting forever for the first two we where not interested.  To top it off my son (whom I was trying to get to finish his salad) proceeds to take a bite of salad then pull a long black hair outta his mouth.  Needless to say he wouldn't finish the salad.  The response from the waiter, oh sorry about that, have a nice day....."}
{"text":"Steak is really good , and so is the costumer service . There chili is pretty good to, I game them a 5 star because the quality of the good food"}
{"text":"We accidentally found Texas Roadhouse while we were visiting nearby Litchfield Park. We've never been to this chain restaurant but we surprisingly enjoyed it. Ordered a rack of ribs that were very good and fried chicken breast which comes with gravy, I wished I had ordered the gravy on the side, but that's a personal preference, the gravy was really good but more than I needed. I was most impressed by the staff and their teamwork approach, dirty plates were instantly whisked away and when we requested extra BBQ sauce and napkins they magically appeared."}
{"text":"Great dinner!  Brought 11 people to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  Food was delicious.  Service was excellent.  Our server, Kaylee, was awesome!  She was especially wonderful with the kids."}
{"text":"This location was so much fun and food was good! Hostess was on point. I went in with a team of 10 hungry guys ... Food arrived hot and accurate! The T-bone steak was cooked to perfection at medium rare! Location is loud but if your looking for a fun night this is your spot!"}
{"text":"The advisor or manager tried denying to give me my food because I was \"3 minutes past their closing time.\"  Eventually a different nice counter girl gave us our food."}
{"text":"The Steakhouse was an extremely good balance between quality food, reasonable prices, and newness.  Looking at this versus the Outback down the road, this wins"}
{"text":"If Ruths Chris is too pricey and pretentious this is your kind of place.  The ribs are delicious fall off the bone tender but what restaurants call a full rack isn't a full rack so if you want a rack like you buy at the store you wont get that here.  The T bone and Rib Eye's are amazing, could use less salt for me but excellent steaks.  The service is warm, friendly and attentive NO COMPLAINTS, well worth $60 (including tip) for a T Bone, prime rib and fixings plus a beer and a frozen drink. Ended up with enough food for 2 to have lunch the next day.  Dressing is made fresh, if you don't like cheese on yoru salad order without or get the Cesar its fantastic, ask for extra dressing and put in your doggie bag for the next day! its that good!"}
{"text":"My family and I went there last Sunday. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated promptly. Then, we were promptly greeted by our friendly waitress.  I had ordered the pulled pork sandwich with steakfries. It was great! The best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had! The pulled pork was juicy, beyond tender, and good enough for my toddler to enjoy. The best steak fries I've ever had! The only thing that wasn't great was my husband and mother-in-law did complain that their steaks were not tender at all. I give it 4 stars because of the tender, melt in your mouth pulled pork. Also because, of all places, a steakhouse should have tender and juicy steaks."}
{"text":"Steak was great! Got the New York strip. Bread and butter was awesome. The downside is the seating. Very cramped and small tabletops are not good. Waiters were great. Very reasonable. Surely going back!"}
{"text":"Alexandra was our server..I don't think we've have better service anywhere! She's great..everything came out perfect and we never asked or waited for anything. Love the filet here :)"}
{"text":"Food is great, but the service we had this evening was terrible. I had to ask repeatedly for ice since my tea came out warm. My husband's meal was not entered correctly, so his salad came out 10 minutes after everyone else's. His steak came out 15 minutes after everyone else received their entree. We were told 3 times by the waiter that the manager would come speak to us, but he never did. He did attempt to serve us food that was ordered by another table. On top of the poor service, and the delay in food, our bill showed no adjustment. We will not be back!"}
{"text":"My grandparents and I had a fantastic meal here tonight. Our server, Anahi, was one of the sweetest and most attentive servers I've ever had. I was truly impressed by our service, but the meal was delicious and cooked perfectly as well. I've been to Texas Roadhouse many times at different locations but this was one of the best experiences by far!"}
{"text":"Good meat. Buns are carb-crack.    Why, oh why, are the Texas Roadhouse buns like crack? Add that cinnamon butter and I'm liable to eat them all, blocking any attempts from my dinner company to partake.  \"You want a bun more than you want that arm,\" I said... to our one year-old.  It's shameful!  Ribs, prime rib, and kids options were all good, too.  Very nice to have one of these close by in Goodyear, now.    And by the looks of it, there is some law in Maricopa County that says people have to take their mothers to Texas Roadhouse for Mothers Day.  Jeez... there were so many moms in the place, you thought there were some food specials for family interventions going."}
{"text":"We were passing through town heading home from a holiday visit in NC. We started out with a few mishaps in the beginning. Our server/bartender Abby was extremely professional and kind and took great care of us. I also appreciate the tact and professionalism that the service manager Kristen had with us. If not for the two of them specifically, we probably would have left upset and hungry."}
{"text":"We were actually here back in September.  We were staying at the Wig Wam Resort, and this place came up in a Yelp search for food.  We were hungry after traveling!  Service was great (although every so often throughout the night they turn up the music for certain songs so loud that you literally CANT continue a conversation at your table, unless you enjoy screaming at each other... we dont, so it was a little rough on catching up with our friends who we had met up with when we arrived in town).  Food was great... standard steak, and BBQ fare with the traditional sides you would expect to find in a place like this (my favorite kind of places, usually!)."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for about 3 years now and we try new or just different steak houses often and I have to say this place does them right more often than not.  Once in a while we will get a Ribeye that we question where it is Sirloin since it is not quite as tender but its never been bad enough to complain about.    The wait staff at this particular TR has always been top notch, very courteous and always seem to like their jobs.   There cinnamon butter rolls are amazing and they have a great Ceaser salad as well.    One thing negative I will say but its not worth removing a star.  If you plan on bringing a large group the staff is eager to help and say they can but they really can't, they don't pull tables together but rather seat you in the same area.  I wouldn't use again for larger groups if we wanted to sit at the same table for like a work, church or family event."}
{"text":"Normally the food and service are both quite good at this location. The last two times we've gone there we had to send order back because they've completely over cooked or steaks.  On this occasion we ordered medium steaks for our children and they both came out well done. After having to send them back the kids had to wait 20 minutes for their steaks to come back.  When your kids are seven and nine years old and extra 20 minutes is it an eternity.  Our server didn't do very good job of communicating with us on what was going on. When we got our bill I was expecting some sort of discount and we were offered nothing. Still a good place to go just a little disappointed with the last couple visits."}
{"text":"You can go wrong with pork-chops but when you have the chefs at Texas Roadhouse make them for you, its all smooth sailing down to the stomach:) Excellent place.. highly recommended. ."}
{"text":"The waitress was great but the food was not. My chicken was rubbery and poorly seasoned.  I just ate a few bites of the chicken which I ended up giving the leftover chicken to my parent's dog."}
{"text":"On the bread alone I'm coming back here. I was super excited to find out we had a Texas Roadhouse nearby. I don't even eat steak but I enjoy their grilled shrimp or even their chicken fingers. The staff here were awesome even when they unfortunately ran out of bread. I recovered though when they gave us some on the way out. The cocktails are colorful and if you go for wine don't play yourself and go for the Texas pour because why not? I haven't met a Texas Roadhouse I didn't like and they're consistent I will give them that."}
{"text":"not so good for me?we ordered 2 vegetables for the sides, but they looks like totally different! That looks like cooked six hours ago!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Not only is the staff always friendly and kind, but the food is always great. Fast service, and awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been going to Texas Roadhouse for many many years and always had a good experience, but this time not so good. My first time at this particular restaurant, I ate at the bar and the bartender was very robotic and not very friendly. I ordered a Caesar salad (they are the best) but when it arrived I had to do a double take, the salad was half the normal size! My steak was done to perfection and delicious as always. The bartender never followed through to ask if I was satisfied. She acted like she didn't want to be here."}
{"text":"This is a really good place to stop at if your hungry.  I went to the bar and sat in there as there was a big line waiting for seating.  I sat down and was met by the bartender Ashley.  She took my order and got my drink right away.  The food followed fairly quick considering the place was very busy.  My food came out hot and cooked to my liking.  Ashley was a great server.  She made sure I had what I needed for dinner.  The food was great and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal.  I am not sure but if they take reservations I would make them as it was packed."}
{"text":"Went on Friday 4/21. Watched a ton of people that got there after us get seated ahead of us and my steak which I ordered medium well came out rare. I didn't eat it because I've always been afraid to send food back for fear of what would happen to it. Food took almost an hour to be served as well and it didn't even come out right.  Not sure if we would go back."}
{"text":"Was only in town for less than 12 hours and you can walk to this restaurant from a few hotels.  I have been to several Texas Roadhouse's here in TX, so I knew what to expect.  I have to say my favorite part is the peanuts.  They give you a bucket and you can throw the shells on the ground.  Goes perfect with a cold beer!  This night I had the grilled chicken salad.  It was a large portion with plenty of additional veggies on top of the lettuce and chicken.  Previously I've had the grilled chicken breast covered with white gravy and cheese (yes you are supposed to pick either/or, but it's even better with both!).  House rolls were an added bonus, they are good!  Never had anything bad here, just was disappointed they didn't have Zeigenbock on draft, but I guess it's true when they say \"Only Texans get It!\"  Great selection of steaks, chicken dishes, sandwiches, and salads. I know the ones here locally have a decent happy hour as well!"}
{"text":"Very good. Bonelss ribs are really good. Sweet potato tastes awesome."}
{"text":"I really wish it was possible to give zero stars as this place is terrible! I am sitting in this restaurant as I type this. My wife no I along with our two children came here tonight as today is our 16 year anniversary.  The young ladies and our server (Morgan) were exceptional and this review is in no way a reflection on them. However, their kitchen staff is terrible. Our onion blossom was floating in oil when we received it. My wife's steak had to be sent back three times only to be sent out burnt. My steak was sent back twice and also came back burnt. My ribs were cold. The sautéed mushrooms and onions were overlooked and cold.  Now, let's talk about the deplorable managers. At no point did anyone apologize. My family (four of us) could not eat together, the food was terrible, and the managers could have cared less.  When we were going out to eat we were originally going to go to Outback but they were on an hour wait so we can to Texas Roadhouse who was not on a wait. Now I know why there was no wait at Texas Roadhouse.........They SUCK!  I hate to be so passionate but quite frankly they ruined our night out and our anniversary dinner.  Texas Roadhouse's leadership needs to take a hard look at the management in this restaurant as they could care less about the guests experience.  I was not looking for anything for free. Just give me an experience that I am paying for.  Well, you lost is as customers. Great Job Texas Roadhouse! Our money will be spent at Outback moving forward.  Thanks for screwing my family and I over!"}
{"text":"Wow, I didn't realize they had such great deals before 5:30pm. They've got early bird pricing of $10 for something like 10 of their dishes. My mom got chicken tenders, with corn and a baked sweet potato. Holy cow, for the price, they loaded her up. I saw that on Wednesdays they do an 8oz sirloin steak with two sides for $11. I ordered it medium, and was ecstatic when it came out cooked perfectly. I too had corn, and sweet potato with marshmallows on top. They were good, but I think next time, I'll just stick with a regular baked potato instead.  Because we were out for my birthday dinner, I decided to have a drink. I couldn't help but get the fruity blue Curacao concoction. It was awesome. I knew I shouldn't, but I could have drank two or three more of them based on taste alone. If you like sweet drinks without the alcohol burn, it's the one for you.  Since we live nearby, and now I've learned that they have such great deals, my girlfriend and I will definitely be frequenting this place in the near future."}
{"text":"Yep, Texas Roadhouse as a whole has gone downhill. I sat at the bar on this night. It was busy because of a Badgers game. Thought I would get better and quicker service. I was wrong. The rolls were the best part of the meal. The Caesar salad was really limp. My steak was just horrible. It must be like McDonald's, weight before cooking! . I tried to get the bartenders attention, and nothing. It seemed like he had a newby with him and had to babysit her. I paid and left. I will not try another Texas Roadhouse again. Rather eat at Mickey D's, yes that bad."}
{"text":"Very... Repeat very average...I ordered barbecue chicken... Straight rubber... It was identical to the \"grilled chicken\" you would get at Burger King.... Mashed potatoes were cold....salad had brown lettuce...server was okay...girlfriends dinner was a little better but the steak was under seasoned..but seriously...the BBQ chicken dinner was next level bad...I just don't have It in me to complain at restaurants...also the servers and hostesses were eating at the hostess station and taking selfies....this I could care less about but it was pretty next level...pretty bad experience...."}
{"text":"Service stinks, server got our food order wrong. Takes the chicken and \"slides\" it off the plate and it takes another 20 minutes to get the ribs we ordered. My friends steak came raw when it was ordered well done and the topping on the cake was we got over charged. Completely dissatisfied with this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I always really enjoy myself when we come. The food is exceptional, and the prices are great, especially when you come in for lunch.   I've yet to recieve a bad order of food, and the service has always been speedy and polite.   The rolls that they give you just for showing up are always fresh, and come with the best cinnamon butter ever. My husband always orders steak, and I always steal some. I'm personally a fan of their chicken critters, the hand batter is so so good.   I do give it a 4 out of 5 just because of the atmosphere. It's very loud and there's multiple tvs going as well as a jukebox."}
{"text":"I just figured out how to add my follow up to this review that I wrote last July.   I contacted Texas Roadhouse the following day per the response that I got from them.  The lady on the phone was friendly enough and asked a few questions about my experience there to confirm what happened.  She mentioned she was surprised that the lady that was doing the seating didn't stop us to get a manager.  On a side note, I just had this happen to me again at a Denny's with the same reaction from the guy who seated us.  I don't think these guys take their job seriously.  Anyways, the lady I spoke to with Texas Roadhouse apologized and asked me for my address and said she contact the restaurant to follow up and send some gift cards.  I thanked her and we hung up.  Didn't hear back from her again or get anything.  I don't even know if they followed up with the restaurant.    Around August I sent a message to Diania, the Texas Roadhouse representative who wrote the response to my Yelp review:  \"Hi, I wrote the review on 7/18 for the Texas Roadhouse in Gilbert. I called the 800-TEX-ROAD number the next day and spoke with a lady who took my information down.  She seemed concerned that the girl that seated us did not attempt to stop us and get a manager when we informed her about our lack of service while leaving.  The lady on the phone asked for my number and address and said she'd send some gift cards to us. I thanked her for the gesture and felt it was a great effort by the company to apologize for the incident.  We haven't heard anything back since.  The gift cards are not that important to me, but integrity is and if there was really no intention of follow through, it should have never been mentioned. I hope the person who took my info actually spoke with that manager of the Gilbert location.  I suspect the manager may not have ever been made aware of the situation that day by the employee, which, if it were the case, would be a shame.  I do enjoy Texas Roadhouse restaurants very much, and have been a fan of the establishments since the late nineties, when I visited my first one in Colorado Springs. So I have no intention of boycotting the restaurants, but I'm sure I'll avoid the Gilbert location.  Sincerely, Tom H\"  She gave a great response:  \"Tom, I apologize for the delay in responding to your email.  I have been out of town but will look into this immediately.  Follow through on any promise made by Texas Roadhouse is mandatory and not an option.  We pride ourselves on our integrity and always doing right by our guests.  Thank you for bringing this to my attention and for giving me the opportunity to ensure we do the right thing.  Diania C\"   And....never heard anything back again.....here we are in December.  Oh well, I still go to Texas Roadhouse, For the most part, it's almost always a pleasant experience and I've always got great food.  Just the one location in Gilbert left me with some bitterness.  I think the fact that my kids, wife and I were hungrier than usual, plus the fact that it wasn't busy there just added insult to injury."}
{"text":"Great service from the start!  Natasha was our server and took great care of our family.  Just about a half hour before, we walked out of another Texas Roadhouse (see my other review) for non-service.   This one was the opposite!  Plus the food tasted better to me than our usual Texas Roadhouse in Peoria (which we love!).  Kudos for getting it right!!"}
{"text":"Best Texas Roadhouse I have been to. They cooked the steak perfectly with nice grill marks and all. You know what you are getting here and the rolls were scrumptious."}
{"text":"Service is outstanding even when slammed busy which is most of the time. Food is fantastic beginning to end Starting with the hot yeast rolls, the meat (even ask you to cut into your steak upon deliver to make sure it's cooked just the way you like it) and then apple pie for desert. Always a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Good old Texas chain. They have the best cinnamon butter and rolls! My favorite dish is the baby back ribs...they fall off the bone! Not the healthiest choice...but if you need your southern fix....this is the place!"}
{"text":"We love this Roadhouse location. We live in Surprise (will be trying the new Surprise location this weekend) and have frequented this one over the Peoria location. Much better service, food is always on point and a more enjoyable atmosphere over the Peoria location!"}
{"text":"Just as good as the Goodyear location! Jam packed with people and service was still good and food was on point!"}
{"text":"We prefer the location in Goodyear to this location. This one is a lot louder, wait staff is slower, not as attentive & the food is hit or miss. Last time we went my husbands steak was not how he ordered and my prime rib was 1/2 fat and cut at an angle so the meaty part was thin as could be. We're die hard Roadhouse fans but this location could use some changes in management."}
{"text":"We used the online app to set up a reservation and were seated almost immediately.  The menu's were so sticky and gross.  Come on, clean your menu's and give us clean menu! While we were waiting we were surrounded by little moth like bugs.  Not sure what the deal is but not good.  My steak was a little tough and a tad overcooked but OK.  My baked potato came in some foil and was OK but overly steamed from being in the foil to long."}
{"text":"Tonight our server was Jodi, she was extremely attentive, engaged, and got everything right. Texas Roadhouse is one of our family's favorite restaurants to go to, especially when we have a hankering for steak. We each got a frozen margarita: original for me and sangria for my MiL. The kids and hubby got Shirley temples. How can you go wrong with Texas roadhouse's buttery rolls? I got a rib eye and as usual it was delicious. The prices are very affordable, for the five of us, it was $80. We definitely would recommend this restaurant to anyone who hasn't tried it yet."}
{"text":"A little bit of a loud amd bright atmosphere but very attentive and friendly staff and service. They serve their version of the bloomin onion was now $5. Just as good quality as the name brand for reasonable price. We told them we were new customers and the manager owner came out to greet us. If the whole chain is like this restaurant a great value and an overall pleasant casual dining experience.  The catfish was hand breaded. Nice touch!"}
{"text":"Had a great steak there last night. Salad was awesome. Rolls were perfect. Enjoyed my meal. Service was great too. Our waiter was fantastic. Some obnoxious rednecks sat behind us and took pictures of the waitress' backside. Bunch of idiots, but it is Gastonia after all. But overall it was a great meal and decent experience. But nothing bad with the restaurant at all."}
{"text":"Great place. Love the cactus blossom. And the early diner specials are the best. Great steak and a great place. Shout out to our favorite server Tabby. Always smiley and remembers us every time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend ordered a steak medium and when they brought it to us the first time it was rare. The manager was kind enough to remake it. The second time it came back it was slightly less rare but still very chewy! Also the sweet potatoes weren't done right and some rolls were burnt. Our waitress was a great server!"}
{"text":"Great service Best tasting ribs I ever ate had a huge party of 43, friend  going into the service several waitress had such a good time, easy parking"}
{"text":"Once good, now meh.  What can I say?  Noisy, always terribly noisy.  Steaks were no better than anywhere else, which is a shame because they once were excellent, but there has been a huge drop in quality.  Sides are your typical out of the can vegetables and steak fries.  Just not worth the bother any more."}
{"text":"Good place to eat , nothing special like how everyone says it so good or the best steak house ever. Never had a problem here so I'll be coming back ! One thing I don't like about this place is , that we can't get seated unless everyone in the group shows up."}
{"text":"We were running late after a day of tourist things...and we wanted to eat a good steak.  We tried SEVERAL places with a ton of stars, and you know what?  They close at ten, but won't seat you at nine.  I mean, really???????   So we settled on Texas Roadhouse who informed us on the phone that they seat until the minute they lock the door at ten.   Wow, that's great.  AND the food was great.  Wish I had been able to take all I didn't eat, as I was so hungry I way over ordered.  Steak was cooked perfectly, and you'd be amazed how many folks can't make a rare steak.  Hubby loved his meal, and we both had an appetizer.  They brought us drinks promptly and refilled our rolls...oh did I mention the rolls?  Yummmmmmmmmmy.  Go, just go, it's great service from people happy to see you show up, not grumbling because you will make them stay late at work.  And it's great food.  Win Win...."}
{"text":"I had a great visit. All of my meal was perfect and the way I ordered in. I am a fan of this place everywhere I go."}
{"text":"Very dirty--dirty table, dirty silverware and dirty restroom.  Service was terrible--very slow, waitress forgot things and employees acted like we were putting them out when we asked for things they did not bring.  Food was decent, but we won't be back due to all the other issues."}
{"text":"Good steakhouse. Love the atmosphere. Service is good. My ribeye steak was very good and cooked to my liking. I've been here a couple times and would come back."}
{"text":"So this is our first time here in a very, very long time. We are very apprehensive after waiting this long and having some of the staff repeat that our party will need to sit down within five minutes even though we were all standing waiting to be seated for the last 75 minutes... Definitely not good for large parties...."}
{"text":"Ok! so its your typical hey look at me come on in and your somewhere else kinda place...WIth that said the filet mignon is very good and the catfish is top shelf they serve it with a spicy mustard and the portions are generous. I will eat there often weird for a chain."}
{"text":"Not as good as usual. We like some TR, but this meal was less then great. Bland tasting food even though service was good."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst dinner I have ever had. Ribs were so burned you could not eat the meat very well. Rolls were under cooked now I know we were a large party of 9 but still the food was subpar. Will I go here again. No I will go back to the one on 75th ave and Mcdowell much better food and service there. Never had mashed potatoes come to you that were not mashed just seem to be a mashed baked potato. Shrimp was served cold and it was supposed to be grilled and hot."}
{"text":"Excellent food service is great also took my wife here for sweetest day  and we had a great experience!"}
{"text":"Great food; great drinks... appetizers super yummy...   EXCELLENT service.  Went in with a party of 30 (adults/11u team). We were assisted by 3 servers: one in particular was AMAZING at her job: Kelsey.  She was SUPER, SUPER, personable, friendly, helpful, professional, and we never went without anything - was there with the next drink, or bread, etc. she was so fun... just really out of words and praises for her... just pure, pure, EXCELLENCE."}
{"text":"Yes a chain but so good. Sometimes feel like they put people by the bathroom for no reason but that is maybe 1/5 times there. Update 1/10 times. Best deal for steak in town, crowded with people from surrounding tiny towns."}
{"text":"Came here with friends after a long day at the mall and seeing a movie. Got here about 930pm Monday night December 18. First thing, cannot believe how cold it is in there! Even with my sweater, it was FREEZING. Doesn't help since it's also freezing outside. That was unpleasant. I ordered the fried pickles for an appetizer. Pretty good. They were cold though. When i order fried pickles I expect them to be blazing hot inside, not luke warm and soggy.  Our food came. Don't know what my friends got, but I ordered the 10oz prime rib..gave me a 13oz but that's totally fine because prime rib is amazing. Well, not here. All I got was a bland, cold piece of meat. Had to drown it in raw horse radish to get a flavor, but I love horse radish soo... The music was so loud I cannot even hear myself talk. Or my friends talk I might give this place another try, but not for a while. I'll stick to the amazing Texas roadhouse in surprise on Grand."}
{"text":"Food just so so now .. My credit card number was stolen here..  This was the second time in 3 years."}
{"text":"I have been there twice now. The first time I purchase the ribeye and it came out cold and I didn't send it back. The second time I went there I purchase the ribeye again and I ordered it medium rare rare, but it came out medium well. I sent it back and they gave me a rare steak. Both times I was surprised that the ribeye was very thin, as if someone pushes it down when cooking. My wife cooks ribeye all the time and I eat ribeye out a lot so I do know what it's supposed to taste and look like. There was very little flavor at all, it was too thin, so I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Good service and food.  Been to this chain a few times and continue to revisit.   Bread and peanuts are filling so we end up taking a lot of our entree home."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've eaten at this location. It was delicious as all the other locations. My grandparents enjoyed their steaks and my ribs were so good. Very tender. I love the fresh bread. We all felt extremely satisfied and have leftovers for tomorrow so very generous portions. The service was prompt and friendly. Make sure to call ahead, though, as they tend to get busy. We did and were seated immediately. I'm sure we will be coming back. Although be aware, it is very loud that sometimes its almost too loud to hear each other"}
{"text":"TRH is one of my favorite places to eat.......most time but last night is an exception. We went early to beat the crowd. They were still busy but the wait wasn't bad. I thought I would be adventurous and order something different. I love their sirloin steak so I didn't wander too far off the path, I ordered the sirloin(medium well) and ribs. The meal came out and instead of sirloin I was served a medium rare ribeye. The ribs were very dry, had an odd taste. A manager did come to our table to assure me they wouldn't charge me the higher price of the ribeye. That was big of them. I still love the TRH and will be back but, I will stick to the old standard."}
{"text":"I love their house salad at Texas Roadhouse, and the dinner rolls, and their basic sirloin steak which is cooked to perfection for about $12.00. I usually prefer locally-owned digs, but this is an exception."}
{"text":"I was excited when I learned that we were getting a Texas Roadhouse BBQ close to our house it Tempe. Hubby and I stopped in for a late lunch today. Things started well with the TASTY rolls and cinnamon butter. We should have stopped there. I love ribs. If I had to pick my last meal it would be ribs. I didn't finish mine. That says volumes of you know how I love ribs. They were oddly salty. Also no BBQ sauce on the table.  My loaded baked potato $.99 more was tasteless. And dry. Hubby had the BBQ chicken. He said it was ok. Not great.  The fresh vegetables consisted of broccoli and carrots and they were rock hard. He also had the loaded sweet potato which came topped with marshmallows and brown sugar sauce. He said it was sweet but good.  Our waitress was very nice and stopped by four or five times until we were half way through the meal. Then I never saw her and I never got a refill on my drink. She finally popped back on after another waitress saw our empty plates for a long time and took them away.  Pros- it's cheap. Dinner for two under $30.  But not for me."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's always OK. Met my daughter for dinner tonight. It was surprisingly crowded. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger. Even though they'll let you order your steak medium, hamburgers are either medium well or well done. The burger had good flavor but not juicy at all (I guess that's the result of a medium well cooked burger). My daughter got the chicken fingers. It was a ton of food and had a nice crispy batter. The service was friendly but kind of slow except they were quick with the refills. I did like that! Overall not a bad experience."}
{"text":"Saturday night dinner! The place was packed and loud. The service was average for a full house. The waitress staff was mediocre.   I ordered the 16oz ribeye steak meal paired with load sweet potatoe and chill. The food was just okay. The side of chilli was too salty ,so I returned it and settled for a side mushrooms. The steak's temperature was perfect,but lacked flavor.   The waitress brought the check to the table before I could even think about dessert...seemed rushed the entire time.   Tip: Concord on a Saturday night is the worst,so be sure to add about 20min to your travel time."}
{"text":"This is the first time at this restaurant and I promise you it will be the last. The food was absolutely horrid and it took forever to even get it out. I was very dissatisfied with all 3 meals at my table. The only reason I gave it a 2 star is Caleb the server was amazing. I will have to say he is the best server I have had in my 13 years of living in Phoenix. He should def be looked at for management if he wants it. At least the head trainer for the company"}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is a great restaurant. Great Food. Love their salads. Pork chops are delicious too. Fun atmosphere. Lots of selections to choose from. Nice staff and good service. Will definitely be back. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"We were outside waiting for 45 min, which is standard for a popular place on a Saturday night. The staff was friendly until we came down to our waiter. He took our orders well and got most of everything right.. but when the ribs weren't brought out we heard\"it's wasn't my fault\" the girl dropped them and didn't want to tell you. That statement was absolutely horrible, when we asked for more dressing he didn't ask what kind. Just went and got a random dressing and stated \"that's what he handed me\" smh.. overall the food was not bad but the waiter is what cause the night to be a little difficult"}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday with my daughter, waiting on my son to arrive 10 mins after us. I was told that we could t be seated until he got there. I told the young lady at the front that we were going to start ordering appetizers and drinks straight away but she said it was against company policy to seat us if our full party wasn't present. I again told get we weren't just going to sit at the table and wait for him, we were going to order right away. She refused to seat us. We left and went to Red Robin instead.  I thought it was bad customer service. Neither i or my son, who goes there often with his friends, will ever go there again."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Food was ok, pretty much what we did expect. But then our waitress gave us our check and we weren't even half-way through our steaks?! She said no rush but NO offer to see if maybe we wanted dessert, another beer...nothing. We have never experienced this at any other restaurant ever even on a busy Friday night and we enjoy dining out on a weekly basis.  Needless to say we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The steak was pretty average,thank god for their cinnamon bread saving there business so people are so full they forget they ate less than half the steak because it wasn't good. longhorn makes way better steaks and I regret driving this far from the main city for this and it was more expensive than longhorn because they charged me for my sides separately but I was over this place and just left  do not even try this place.even Perkins has better value for steak."}
{"text":"The service I received here at this location was by far the worst. We arrived around 9:30pm while we knew the place would close at 10pm but thought no big deal because it's still open. My fiancé and I were greeted with a waitress that was gossiping to her co-worker that we wanted to dine in instead of just get food to go.  We sat there some but after she waited and stood for me to review the menu, we ordered. We saw the staff of the whole restaurant practically staring at us wondering why we were there. Well is my birthday and if I want steak I should get it. After all, it's my day. Well, we finally had had enough and asked the waitress to just make it a to go order and we were able to take the food and leave. Only reason this review is two stars was that the food was great. I'd recommend to go orders and never deal with such a rude staff that has 0 skills in the customer service industry."}
{"text":"Good steak, good sides, decent price. A solid choice for a mid-range steakhouse. Staff was friendly and helpful, let us sample sides so we choose one we liked, since we'd never been to a Texas Roadhouse before."}
{"text":"I must say going in I was prepared for a chain type steak dinner and was suprised when I found myself leaving Very Satisfied! Nice Job TRH."}
{"text":"Greeted by a friendly hostess followed up by a great waitress who was accommodating and efficient. The starter bread is amazing with the apple cinnamon butter. Melt in your mouth awesomeness. Another melt in your mouth awesome dish are the ribs. They truly are fall off the bone. My fiancée ordered salmon and she enjoyed it very much. It was grilled and seasoned very well. The sides are plentiful and tasty. Store is clean and has seating in doors and out. Great lunch specials as well"}
{"text":"An amazing start to Easter Sunday. The biscuits and butter was amazing. So we went right in to the meal. I ordered the rib appetizer for my dinner. An amazing savory Smokey taste. The bones fell right off of the meat. The bbq chicken was juicy, tangy and delicious. The rice was a tad under cooked, yet the seasoned really well.   Now the bad.   We also ordered the 20 oz. bone in rib eye. We asked for medium well. But we ended up leaving more than half of the steak because it was extremely bloody. Mind you, we brought it up to the waiters attention. Which he did offer to put it through the oven again. We declined because by then we were grossed out by the amount of blood coming out. Moving past it we decided to order the strawberry cheesecake. When it arrived the syrup looked like the bottom leftover of a bottled water. It was completely watered down."}
{"text":"The bottomless bread and cinnamon butter alone are worth the trip.  I've seen others complaining about the wait, or the order in which parties are seated.  What they fail to realize is that Texas RH offers Call Ahead seating.  They'll put you on the list, and give you a window of time in which to show up, so your wait can be done comfortably at home (which is why later parties seem to be seated first).   Any halfway decent restaurant is going to have a wait, at least this one gives you a convenient way to work  around it.  Short of turning business away for your personal wait-time convenience, that's really all they can do.    I've been here countless times, and the food is consistently amazing.  Rolls are hot and buttery, meals are made fresh to order.  All of the steaks are wonderful, tender, and juicy, but I'd also highly recommend the pulled pork.    The staff is great.  They keep our drinks full, and check in like clockwork.  Because it's so busy, servers usually stick to the priorities (seating, food, refill checks), but they always make time to ensure our food is cooked right after bringing it to us.  They're polite, but they don't have a lot of time to linger and chit-chat (For me, that's actually a plus).  The one downside is that Texas RH is always packed, and usually pretty loud.  If you're looking for a quiet dinner, with a lot of personal one on one time with your server, this probably isn't the place for you.  But if you want consistently great food, speedy service, and a fun atmosphere, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Texas Roadhouse on Sunday. I know they are always busy for dinner, but I wasn't expecting it to be that busy for lunch! They quoted us a 15-20 min wait, but it ended up being much shorter than that. They sat us at a table, rather than a booth. I didn't even realize they had regular tables. Every time I've been to Texas Roadhouse in the past I have been seated in a booth. Weird. And the table only had 3 of 4 chairs and a random tray stand next to it. It took a long time to be greeted and order drinks, however the server apologized for the long wait and offered us a free appetizer. She looked at us like we were crazy when we turned it down. \"How about a dessert?\" No, thank you, we don't need the extra food. She seemed so surprised. I would've taken a discount on the check, but she didn't offer that. Still a nice gesture. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with steak fries. To be honest, I don't think their pulled pork is that great, but I usually order it because I'm not really a steak person and I didn't feel like chicken. I just come for the yeast rolls! I seldom even use the cinnamon honey butter cuz I like them just the way they are. But of course after eating 3 of those things, I wasn't very hungry for the entree. There was a huge pile of pork on that sandwich too! And a big ol' onion ring. I asked for some extra BBQ sauce, set aside the top bun, and proceeded to tackle it open faced. I didn't get very far and ended up taking a lot of pork home, a few steak fries, and two rolls. It made a tasty lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"We generally have good food but tonight it was a little different. I ordered an 8oz Thick cut New York Strip steak it came out cooked ok but with 4oz of fat and about 4oz of meat. They did make another steak but everyone was done... they just let it roll off their backside...."}
{"text":"This restruant has exellent food and steak as one of them. its a perfect place with Texas foods and fun buckets of peanuts. And also, with an exelleent bar sports tv! its fun and great to go. Its a great place to eat! we also met the best waitress in town of this restruant kaylee. You have to ask for her to serve you! !!! Love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch with some friends and family.   Located between Trader Joe's and Outback Steakhouse off Grand Avenue with lots of available parking.   Good signage and the restaurant is large enough that it can't be missed from Grand Avenue.   Very clean on the exterior and interior minus the peanut shells on the floor upon entering.   Staff were warm and welcoming.  We were quickly acknowledged and brought to our seat, and even asked along the way how we were doing today.  As you're brought to your seat, you are provided with a complimentary basket of hot bread (lightly buttered on the top) with a scoop of (what tasted like) cinnamon butter.  All tables have 2 buckets - 1 with ground peanuts and the other for the shells.  Love the novelty! Staff came quickly to our table to take drink, appetizer, and food orders.  Drinks were brought to the table quickly, and by that time, the complimentary bread was already wolfed down by some of the hungry members in our party.  Waitstaff asked if we wanted refills on the bread but we declined.  Menus were already conveniently located on the table.  We ordered and meals came on time with an average wait.   I had the steak with two sides - the green beans and buttered corn.  The greens beans had a strong smokey taste to it which I couldn't tolerate and had to leave.  The corn didn't appear brightly yellowed and fresh, but appeared more saddened and wasn't buttered as advertised.  The steak was cooked as requested but tasted as if only seasoned with a touch of salt.  For me, the food was a bit of a miss (-1).   I may be willing to give them another try in future to compare the taste of the food."}
{"text":"I have to say I went on a Monday at 7 PM so it wasn't packed. Had a really nice funny waiter. The bread they give you in the beginning is really soft but the maple butter is a little too sweet. But the ribeye I had man... it was a perfect medium rare, had a good flavor... I only went once so far but as of right now I dig it"}
{"text":"The service is good and the food is great.  Went in with a large party(15) and everyone was happy with the way their steak was cooked.  From very rare(blue) to well done.  Thank you."}
{"text":"As we walk into the restraunt there were three blonds gossiping and playing and talking about their fake eyelashes and took 5minutes for us to even get our name down. Once we did, we quickly got called up and as the lady calle my name my family and I start to follow her, but as we are following she grabs a whole tray of food and serves another table on the way to seat us. We get to our table and it was disgusting! Dirty table tops and seats, and our small plates that came with our appatizers had cheese and old bbq sauce on all of them. Now, I understand maybe there could of been a dishwasher mistake but how do you put plates on a table with out even looking??! Our server comes to the table Charlie. She asked if we had been here before and we replyed no and she says well okay are you ready to order. No specials, no welcome, not a damn thing! We told her we would need a minute and she came back within 1 minute rushing us to order. We finally ordered and since I am a new customer I had a few questions and as I asked a question about a side options she gave me a blank stare and actually asked me if I was done with the questions. I had only asked one at the time witch was what comes on the loaded fries... Anyways, my family and I proceeded with our meal it was amazing. Great cooked steak, awsome fries and lovley sides to match. Once we got our check and as she dropped it off she just layed it on the table and didnt say one word and that was the last we saw of her. And as we were signing our recipe we see a busser take everything off the table next to us and a hostes automatically seating a new family with out even whiping anything down.This restraunt is not clean at all and lack of customer service. My family and I will never be back to this location again."}
{"text":"Had a party of 6 and were refused seating until the last member came. No special table was pushed together or created to accommodate the group. The booth clearly would have always sat the party of 6. This is a stupid policy and should be reviewed."}
{"text":"My prime rib was good but my daughter steak was WAY over cooked ... policy states it should be free but was still charged full price even though she had to wait for them to cook a new one.  Our waitress never ask to refills my daughters drinks until I asked for the check but little to late for that because I was already to go. I love their bread and I highly recommend the bone in ribs eyes. I been here many times at Texas Roadhouse it's all way good value for money."}
{"text":"We showed up here during Spring Training and it was busy.  We were told the wait was 25 minutes and that was right on.  We were seated and greeted promptly and ordered drinks and an appetizer and food. We got the drinks right away and then we proceeded to get the appetizer, salad and meals all in the next three minutes.  Wow.  A little too close for us.  We really did not get to enjoy the appetizer since we did not want our food to get cold,  The food was pretty good and I understand they are trying to turn tables, but this was overboard."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to dinner last night.  We shared a Blossom, which was far better than offered by Outback, I had the Roadkill, along with a baked potato and side of chili. All were really good. MY wife had the 6oz. sirloin along with the chili and fries. She said the chili was too spicy for her, so our waitress (Christy)  brought her out a Caesar Salad. The sirloin was done properly and tender. Christy, our waitress, was both attentive and knowledgeable. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Well...I tried this restaurant again...and again was disappointed. This time I tried the Roadkill. After all, how can you mess up a hamburger steak? After two failed attempts to get it right, I just gave up, paid for my beer and my wife and daughter's steak and left. I doubt I will return. By the way...nobody finished their meal. I also had their chili, which was tasty, but not very warm. When our waitress asked how it was I told her it wasn't very warm. To this she gave me a look like a deer in my headlights and made no comment whatsoever. I told her that if she didn't really want to know, please don't ask. The Sam Adams was (once again) cold and good tasting."}
{"text":"I come here for the ribs which are amazing loaded baked potato which is also great, and Caesar salad as a side. The Caesar salad hasn't been that great lately. For example on my last visit it barely had any dressing on it and ONE crouton  you get complimentary hot fresh baked rolls with cinnamon butter and peanuts while you wait for your food. We also get the onion blossom. Let me tell you, AMAZING! Especially with that sauce it comes with, I've also tried it with ranch which is pretty good. For drinks I tend to get sweet tea which is not the best, last time I tried my boyfriends strawberry lemonade and it was surprisingly really good. Moving on, the waiting time is usually not that bad for the most we've only waited almost 10 minutes. But on our last visit... It was ridiculous!!!!! We did get a complimentary appetizer. Our waitresses are always super nice and attentive. Also almost every time we go there the manager goes around and ask how everything was. I love that."}
{"text":"Horrible service!  We sat for 5 min before anyone greeted us. A nice girl came up and told us our server was busy with a big top and she would get our drinks.  She came back and took our order. Our food was dropped off by food runner. No one checked on us. No one refilled our drinks. No one cleared our plates. Then a lady can up and asked if we needed boxes. Took another 10 min to get our check. We asked if she was our server all she said was yes we'll both of us then left. Still table full of dirty plates. Looked for a manager on our way out couldn't see one just three people at the host stand who never acknowledged us.  The only food that was good was the house salad. Will never go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing ribs and the fried pickles are delicious! Our server Angela is always excellent, very friendly and attentive (we try and get her as our server when we go). We LOVE Texas Roadhouse!"}
{"text":"We brought our work team here for a get-together as our consultant was in town. We called ahead approximately 2 hours ahead for the on-deck seating for our party of 9. Even so, we were seated at two separate tables, as despite the fact that there were an abundance of open booths, they opted to seat other parties in the tables in the middle of the dining room that could've been pushed together. As well, the tables at which we were seated two 4-tops, so our 9th member had to tack herself onto the corner of the booth. We were given two separate servers, and my table received our food a good 5-10 minutes after the other table, as our server was not nearly as attentive as the other. Only reason this service gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because the beers were sizable, and my food was prepared well, though other members of the party reported way overcooked steaks."}
{"text":"Had my favorite smothered chicken and it was righteous, yet again.  Have you tried it yet?"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Texas Roadhouse two or three times in the last couple months.  Its always busy and the service is great.  I've been seated promptly each time.  The location is fantastic because it is just a stone's throw from the hotel I stay at on business on occasion.  Tonight, I ordered the chicken dinner with mushrooms and onions, and sides of mashed potatoes and sauteed veggies.  All was delicious, as usual!  I also had a 22 oz Sam Adams and bottle of Yuengling.  The free peanuts are a bonus.  The free bread is hot and tasty.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I came here the other night with my extended family - we had a party of 8.  We were seated pretty quickly, which I wasn't expecting.  The atmosphere was unnecessarily loud at times. They would turn the music up and conversation would be impossible.    The food wasn't bad, but we weren't pleased that there was a 10 minute delay from half of us getting our meals to the other half being served. This hasn't been an issue in the past and is quite a sticking point.  Next time, we will definitely pass on Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"We went to have dinner last night as a family. We were told the wait was 25 minutes. It turned to be 45 minutes. We were then seated at a table and upon being seated told that there was no silverware. Not sure how a restaurant runs out of silverware on a Saturday night. We were then brought our appetizer about 30 minutes later and weren't given any plates or napkins with that. My husband had to get up and go look for plates so that we could enjoy our chicken wings after being there an hour and 15 minutes. Meanwhile our waitress still hadn't taken our order. 2 hours later we were provided our dinner of of prime rib, filet, shrimp, & ribs. Never once was there an apology for the service or lack thereof. We requested our bill and our food upon delivery at our table. Needless to say, are $100 to go dinner was not what we look for when going out. When families go out there looking for service and an atmosphere to enjoy. We won't go back. Management needs to be changed."}
{"text":"My \"go to\" restaurant. Shannon is the best server. She made sure everything was awesome and never seemed to \"disappear\" when I needed something.  Food is consistently delicious (always get sirloin steak)   Shannon is a great server!  & Don't get me started on the rolls!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious (the hot buttered rolls are addictive so plan on taking some of your meal home!).  We were not fans of the shouting that occurred for everyone who had a birthday or other special event to celebrate.  The noise level in general was a bit much for us.  The wait was long but we would call in to get on the list prior to arrival next time.  The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Decent burger for the price it was my first time going to a Texas roadhouse I'm from out of town service is really good and the whole staff was really friendly I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"This location has been our choice to stop at on our way home from the Illinois State Track and Field Championship Meet held at Eastern Illinois for the past 4 years.  We usually have 6 coaches with 8-15 athletes and have never had a problem being seated in the same dining room until this year!  Apparently there is a new owner with new policies and a rude employee that enforces this ridiculous situation. We were willing to wait until a few tables opened up in one area but were told they no longer seat large parties. They advertise to call ahead for seating but refuse to hold tables anymore so our party of 12 would have been split up all over the place.  We chose to leave after Stephanie (I believe) made it perfectly clear her boss could choose to make any rules he wants as he owns the place.   To the old owner I would like to say thank you for making our dinners a celebration with a fabulous waitress that sat our State Medalist on a saddle and proceeded to yell to all around our dining area about her accomplishments!  We were hoping to repeat that experience on yearly basis when possible but now have a new tradition and will never go back to Texas Roadhouse in Champaign, Illinois."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp! for the free cactus blossom when we checked in. :) We were debating an appetizer for the table, so you made that decision easy for us!  Texas Roadhouse is a chain, so it's pretty much the same no matter where you go. I know some people love them, but I hate the peanuts on the table. I like the honey butter that's served with the dinner rolls. Their food is decent, there are lots of options, and it's not too expensive."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, they do a very good job. Service is great, and the food comes out to your liking. Drinks are also very good.   Got the steak and loaded sweet potatoes; they were very good. No complaints.   One star down for nothing exceptional -- it was good but nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Just what I expected. It was ladies night in my family and I had a serious craving for a medium rare steak. My grandmother suggested this place! I did call ahead seating on a Saturday night so when I arrived, I only had to wait an additional 10-15 minutes for my table. WIN!!!! We were seated in a booth.  Our server's initial greeting took a while to receive but once we received our drinks...things moved a little quicker. I ordered the rum margarita with an extra kicker....it was the perfect way to kick start ladies night!  I ordered the 6 oz filet with shrimp on top. It was nice and tender and hit the spot. My salad was wonderful too! Everyone enjoyed their meal.   Now onto the reason of why I am giving them a not so great rating.  A fight broke out when I was there and it was between a employee and guest. This was confirmed by our server. Although, I don't think the employee was the cause of confrontation but his yelling and body language didn't help the situation. It was quite the commotion and to-do. The entire restaurant was focused in on this drama. A lot of cursing and yelling. I'm not only embarrassed for the employee and management but for this brand in general.  It made my entire table nervous, especially my grandmother.  My little 8 year cousin was shaken up as this kind of behavior she has never seen. It was unnecessary of the employee to get involved and I hope that management has spoken with him. Upon leaving we saw 4-5 cop cars out front and passed a few more on our way out.  Great food but not a safe place to eat.  I would leave the kids home if you're thinking about trying this place."}
{"text":"Always delicious, always fresh! I've experienced prompt, friendly service each time I've visited. Early bird dinner specials are plentiful. Meats and seafoods are cooked perfectly. The buns and butter are a delicious starter. I love the side salad."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here reminds me of home San Antonio Texas I live in Alaska now so I am joyed going to Texas roadhouse when I travel or when I'm in Anchorage"}
{"text":"It was a mistake to even set foot in this place. The biggest problem was the food; the steaks are injected with msg laced liquids to fake you into thinking they taste good. My medium steak arrived rare and dripping with blood in the center. Everything was oversalted, again, to try to trick your tastebuds. The place was so loud I couldn't even hear the server. Not ever going back."}
{"text":"While visiting a friend in AZ I mentioned wanting a steak so we came out to this spot. When we got there it was extremely close to closing time, we told the hostess we'd go someplace else but she assured us it wasn't a problem and happily seated us anyway. On our way to the table she grabbed a basket of hot rolls that my friend went on and on about the entire way there but I honestly wasn't impressed, lol. They weren't bad but I didn't find them to be as amazing as he does.  I ordered the Ft. Worth Ribeye, broccoli, and a side salad, my friend had the oven roasted half chicken, mashed potatoes with brown gravy, and broccoli.  We both really enjoyed our food very much. My steak was tender and juicy and I'm not sure what they put on their broccoli but it was delicious and complimented my steak very well and that's saying a lot... I'm talking about broccoli here.  Our waitress whose name escapes me was super fun and sweet, we had a nice time.  This was my first time at a Texas Roadhouse and for a chain, I was impressed. Great food that didn't break the bank."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre, not that great. They were out of mashed potatoes. I was expecting the chicken fried chicken to be more juicy and tasty. It was a little too dry for my liking. The baked potato that replaced the mashed potatoes was really good though."}
{"text":"Great place to have a meal with family, can be a little on the loud side cause ita always a busy place, recomend calling ahead and getting name put on waiting list, reservations party of six or more only price range moderate, but well worth it"}
{"text":"Tonight we dined at one of our favorite restaurants Texas Roadhouse. Right from the get go everything was going good then got even better when we were visited by one of the managers Krystle Bateman. She continues to go above and beyond the call of duty. It is because of her we will continue to be loyal patrons!"}
{"text":"I have been to numerous Texas Roadhouse restaurants over the years, and I have always found them to be decent.  This place was no different, except they took it to another level with the customer service.  They were incredibly attentive and friendly.  Not just our server, but everyone.  The host told the service manager that it was our first visit to this particular location and he came over to welcome us and give us a little bag of peanuts to take back to our hotel room.    The food was very good.  I normally opt for a non-chain steakhouse, but this place was right on point.  The rolls with the cinnamon butter are addicting.  I also like getting my steak like I order it.  When I say medium rare, I expect a warm red center.  This cook was perfect.  The steak just melted in my mouth.    The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars was the tap selection.  I am a craft beer freak, and they only had the normal beers on tap.  Expand those selections and they may just become unstoppable."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you are hungry after 8pm.  They close early, wasted an hour driving to this location. Never again.  Closed for the Super bowl?  Wow"}
{"text":"I loved the bread! Really good steak, great environment, nice servers. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The many things I have ordered here over time:  The bread and butter....to die for!  The side salad with ranch...amazing! (One of the best side salads around)  The steaks....great! (Medium)  Loaded Baked potato ...pretty darn good! (extra sour cream)  Crispy chikcen fingers....Yum!  Shrimp...average! (seemed boiled)  BBQ Chicken Breast...juicy! (Love it loaded it up with onions and mushrooms)  Sweet tea and beer...both great!  Service....pretty good!"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Come here occasionally and about every fourth visit, they go from an acceptable value to absolutely awful.  Tonight was one of those nights.  Had a craving for sirloin, so I ordered that with baked potato and house salad. We already had onion rings and fried pickles the table that were difficult to eat because they were so salty. Got my salad - this was good with bleu cheese dressing. Ate it all, then came the entree. All I asked for was sour cream and butter on the potato. I added black pepper. Was only able to eat a third of it because someone in the kitchen must own stock in Morton's Salt. The skin was worse, since they roll the taters in salt before cooking.   Okay... could they screw up a steak that I asked to be cooked rare? I know they aren't equipped to do black and blue, but rare is hard to mess up. Cooked unevenly, one side of the steak was medium rare, the other was medium well. I think there was some medium pink in the middle. Overall, the meat was lukewarm, temperature-wise. Again, it was me having a little food with my salt.  No one got their steaks cooked correctly. One asked for medium well and got hers bloody. Different cut, or I'd think they mixed the steaks up. She sent gets back. What she got back looked like it might have been thrown in the microwave. It wasn't gone long enough to have been grilled longer.  If not for the usual nice servers, I'd be upset over not giving this place a double zero for stars.  I ate a third of my main plate because of the extra generous portions of salt. This restaurant must have stock in blood pressure meds.   To their credit, they took my meal off the tab and offered me something else because they \"don't want customers leaving hungry.\" I wouldn't have left hungry if they could cook better than a five year old left alone in the kitchen. But I'd rather force a crappy fast food burger down my throat than eat anything more from that kitchen tonight. Already on my fourth glass of water, trying to dilute the salt.  The only thing that would have made me happy would have been a future comped meal on a day they had someone cooking who knew what they were doing. Had I taken them up on the offer tonight, I'd not have been able to eat it, no matter how hungry I still was - for all I know, my replacement meal might have been spit in.  Overall, I've had better meals at Golden Corral - and most of us know how bad that can be.  The kids were happy - young people are more salt tolerant, plus their big brownies didn't seem to be loaded with salt.  Sorry, Texas Roadhouse. You'd already lost most of my family and friends. Tonight, even with as tolerant as I am, you finally accomplished losing me, too.  One word summary for those skimming this review: YUCK!"}
{"text":"I have to start from the beginning of this experience for you to truly enjoy this experience I am about to explain to you!  The restaurant was fairly busy for the most part, after walking In the door, there were two nice ladies with a small child, the little girl wanted to fiat bump w/me so I did. We actually. This continued till I was seated, the mother apologized and I replied for what she's a child having fun it was fun actually.  While being seated I was asked if I had been here recently and I explained it had been awhile since I've eaten at the restaurant. He asked about how long and then proceeded to tell me all about the restaurant and the things I can expect while dinning here.  The waitress also asked and explained everything to me, it was refreshing that she took the time to make sure I felt comfortable while eating in there establishment.  I was asked if I wanted Amy appetizers and I said I was checking in thru Yelp and I receive a free cactus blossom for doing such. I ordered a lemonade and the bread & butter were like I remembered Awesome!  After getting this all squared away, she asked if I was ready to order and I placed my order and it actually arrived to the exact way I asked for it, didn't have to return it unlike a few places I've recently visited! After the first few bites the waitress asked if it was to order and I said absolutely with a great big happy smile.  The waitress was informative, prompt, caring, understanding, most of all genuine, at no moment did I feel the treatment I received was because I checked in with yelp at all!! I have to say for a off the wall outing to eat out, I was happily inspired by my decision and the reviews to eat at this establishment and I will be returning soon!  Thanks so much for the experience from the fiat bumps to the steak, number one service given and appreciated!"}
{"text":"After my competition Saturday 3/10/12 My team and I went to our place to have lunch usually after our pre judging show over at Mesa Art Center for bodybuilding competitions. Order my 7oz sirloin and sweet potatoes. My sweet potatoes wasn't satisfying as other times I've been here but this time it was pretty soggy/watery ehhh but I still ate it because I was craving for yummy food instead of my dieting food haha. My sirloin came out really delicious I was pretty happy and enjoyed it! Overall my meal was pretty tasty and delicious but wish my sweet potatoes wasn't all soggy/watery. Great place!"}
{"text":"This place is a mess! Called ahead and was told we would wait 20 mins , when we arrived we were told another 20-30 mins after 45 mins later we we're told that due to large parties it would be another 10 mins... 20 mins after that we we're told again it would be another 30 mins! All together an hour and a half and still no table... The front manager was rude and this was a horrible experience. Would not waste my money here"}
{"text":"This was our first time going and it was an hour wait just to get in not a big deal expected the food to be great we were sat down our server was great however we got our food and it was all cold tasted the steak I got was not impressed it was nothing special the shrimp was cold the mashed potatoes were cold and the rights was called the appetizer was the only thing that was hot probably won't go back"}
{"text":"Everything's Bigger in Texas...except the tables  This has to be my first visit to TEXAS ROADHOUSE, because whenever I see any sign or *anything* relating to Texas, I keep driving. And actually, I did that this time I was invited there for a birthday dinner, but that's just because I missed the entrance.   The atmosphere was pleasant - again, if you're a TX fan, the staff was fantastic and the rolls and shelled peanuts aplenty. I was greeted by Don, our server who was extremely attentive, positive and quick. Oh, and gorgeous, to boot. Can I put that in here?  I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Chicken with buttered corn and mashed potatoes. The bread served and my sides were good, although a spoon would've worked better than trying to get the remains out of the little dish with a fork. The chicken was pretty good, but...not as much as the delicious mushrooms. It was just enough food for a very reasonable price of $10.99. I didn't need to take any home with me, nor eat anything in addition once home.  They didn't (want to, or were accustomed to) sing for my mother for her birthday, but they did gather, clap and did a big Texas YEE-HA or is it YEE-AH? Eh, again... *Texas* is a place I mess with.  The only real issue I had was the tables were VERY small and, with/without the group of 9 we had, I had to share mine with two others. Now, I didn't have a problem with that, I enjoyed the company, but since the table was so small and there were so many extras on the table - bucket'o'peanuts, bread basket and empty drinking glasses that, sadly, weren't taken when new ones came - we had barely any room for my elbows to rest on the table. Yeah, I know I'm not really supposed to do that... :-)  It's a recommendation, especially from what I heard elsewhere for their ribs, steaks, etc. And if I could request Don again, even if just his number, I'll probably change my rating from 4 stars to 5 STARS, just for him going the extra mile. :-)"}
{"text":"I don't care what city you are dining in, you can never go wrong with Texas Roadhouse. We were in town for a Panthers game & decided to shop & have dinner. I see the call ahead seating & got us a spot in line. We went to check into our hotel & then went to the restaurant. They seated us immediately & didn't even have to wait! The steaks were cooked to perfection & our waiter was fantastic! I will spend my money here anytime!"}
{"text":"Always the best service from Ashley Kilroy and Hallie Ross. Always smiling and recognizes their customers means a lot."}
{"text":"Every one in my family agree it is one of the best stake place. But better make a reservation . Service usually very good."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight for the first time ever and we WILL  be back!  Our waitress Colleen was amazing, offering lots of suggestions on the menu and telling us about little details that make the food so good. (Like the homemade salad dressings and 3-day cooking process for the ribs). I ordered the half slab of ribs with a house salad and sweet potato. Everything was so delicious! My boyfriend got the NY strip with corn and baked potato. We both said it was the next steak we'd ever had! But the real reason we're coming back isn't just because of the glorious food, it was because of Colleen. Thank you for your wonderful service and great dining atmosphere!! Well be back to see you soon!"}
{"text":"Food was good and service was good but the music was WAY too loud! Can't even have a conversation! I love music but I couldn't wait to get out of there! Our party of 10 will never go back since we couldn't even enjoy each others company! Turn it down!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place - the food and the service are both phenomenal. The rolls - I must say are my favorite thing about this place - they are fresh out of the oven and are delectably soft - AND they keep them coming to your table, never leaving you wanting or waiting for more.  I love this restaurant, thank you Texas for sharing your outstanding cuisine!!"}
{"text":"Been to the Roadhouse many many times in many different cities.   Always the best service and best food.   Never really disappointed.  Plus you can throw peanut shells everywhere.     On this visit to the Tempe store on Mothers Day night it was totally crazy busy.  And yet, all of their high standards were once again met.  I had the ribs!   Yummy!  And my friends each had some delicious steaks."}
{"text":"I've been known to hang out here lately on a few occasions.  I keep coming back, so that's always a tell tale sign that I'm digging on it.  I have to say, this is one of the best values for the area.  I come here for two main reasons: 1. To get my fix of delicious steak at a price I can easily choke down, and 2. Fried pickles!  This makes for the perfect combo in my eyes.  Throw in a little margarita and we've got a full blown party going!  Our service here has always been good.  I can't believe I haven't mentioned the free peanuts yet!   Overall, great place to get the best bang for your buck.  It can easily be forgotten , tucked away amongst the billion restaurants by Concord Mills, but seek out and yee shall be rewarded."}
{"text":"Very good steak cooked perfectly and tender. House salad and baked potato were on target side dishes. Gotta love the shell peanuts everywhere. The bread with whipped butter was delicious.   Fast, friendly service was a plus at the bar."}
{"text":"been there at least twenty time and haven't had any service bad enough to remember.  Steaks are always cooked properly.  I get med rare, my wife gets well done which is a challenge for many places.  One of the managers always stops by to check if everything went well.  Be sure to ask about their frequent diner card."}
{"text":"It was our first time. We liked the atmosphere. It was a fun vibe and it was BUSY for a weeknight at 4:30! We liked the free peanuts too. We loved the fresh complimentary bread, but our kid didn't like it. Well, he wanted a hot dog and it was served on the same bread, two rolls, not a hot dog bun. He didn't eat it. The fries were greasy. He ate those.  We ordered potato skins. Yes, they were just basically skins, without much potato meat, in fact almost none. They had way too much cheese on them to compensate. Although just okay, they were the worst I have ever had. Usually I LOVE potato skins!!  I ordered a pork chop. It was flavorful and I liked the little side of gravy which added a lot of flavor. However, it was just average. I've had better. The chili was mostly just ground beef. It had good flavor but I want more of a traditional chili with beans, cooked onion, tomato and a little more \"juice\" rather than such a thick sauce. I was asked if I wanted cheese and onion. I said yes, but regretted it. About 1/3 of the cup of chili was cheese. TOO MUCH cheese. It was disproportional to the amount of chili.  My hubby had a burger. He liked his burger and it was quite large. He said his burger \"was good, but not mind blowing.\" In other words, he has had better.   Our server was \"interesting\" in an very serious kind of nervous way. She was attentive and warmed up in the end. But, it was kind of a weird experience. She was fine though. Like I said, she was attentive and that is what matters.   All the prices were very fair. Kids meals start at $3.99. They have an early dining menu that is quite cheap. They have quite a few early bird choices that start at 4:00 (opening time during the week) for $8.99 including a steak meal. I think I'll order a steak next time. I'll probably try the rib eye or prime rib!! I'm likely to enjoy that more than our choices. After all, it is a steak place!   Overall, we enjoyed our time there and our kid wants to go back. We probably will, but we won't order what we ordered for our first try. We are willing to give them another try. Hopefully, I update with a better experience as far as the food goes!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at the Texas Roadhouse. There was a wait for our table, but we had a choice to wait or not. The server was obviously overwhelmed,all of our food  came out at the same time. My baked sweet potato was so over cooked there was hardly any to eat.My husband's chili was warm, but not hot. Will probably never come back."}
{"text":"The \"award-winning ribs\" were very dry. I noticed the award was actually from 1994 which is when the ribs I had for dinner 23 years later where probably put under a heat lamp. Sure at one time they were probably good ribs but anyone can screw up a good thing. The intention likely was to give the barbecue more texture (one that I actually like) by high temp scoring as the finish, but what they did gain as the original fall off the bone moisture was long lost by what is obviously extremely long high temp exposure and letting them dry out by setting for I can't imagine how long to get this bad. The end of the bones are not only Burnt but you know it's dry when nothing is left on the bone and it's completely white and dry like chalk. The server Zack was a great guy, he wanted to make it right and as we discussed he actually was very knowledgeable about the correct process and where they likely went wrong. I could only choke down 3 ribs out of the full rack I paid $20 for so he found a half rack that where a little better that I could take home. Too bad the dogs can't have pork bones and my kids are too old to play with chalk. Maybe my son and I can throw around the old pigskin!"}
{"text":"Their Chicken Critter Salad's got game. More portion of chicken than any other chicken salad I've ordered elsewhere.  They have other great entrees, but this cowpoke likes his critters"}
{"text":"One of the worse dining experiences I have ever had!  Our food order was lost somehow and after 2 hours, we finally received our food. Management was very accommodating and comped our meals, only to turn around and say that the gift cards I was using would not allow them to use the last 10.00 on each of them, and they needed another 30.00, unknown to us was the fact that they had already taken all of the money off the gift cards. So they actually stole 30.00 from us.  No way to prove it, but be careful if you use a gift card. I will be letting all of my friends know about this!"}
{"text":"We visited tonight (day before Mother's Day) and like the other 2 restaurants we had visited....were SLAMMED! We actually made call ahead reservstions only to find out that they were made at the wrong Texas Roadhouse location,  so when we arrived at the correct location they had to technically \"squeeze us in\" Keep in mind that the walk up wait time at this point was 60-85 minutes. All of the girls at the hostess station were super helpful and enlisted their Manager to help us out.  Although we still had to wait a little while to be seated, the manager or someone (to our surprise)  had sent out an order of chicken fingers for our boys who were so hungry. Not long after that we were seated and everything was timely and great, even for such a busy night. Todd (the manager) and his table seating  helper (an older gentleman) were awesome at accommodating us and made our whole party feel as if we were the only ones there. Wish all restaurant managers and staff were this great! We will be back FOR SURE!!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken & ribs combo. Barbeque chicken breast was very moist and tasty. Ribs. Bit dry but tasty. Sides were tossed salad with the best croutons and cheese bacon fries which were good.  Server friendly and prompt.  Have been here many times. Steaks are awsome. Will not order ribs again."}
{"text":"My wife and I waited more than a year to come back to the Texas Roadhouse to see if the service and quality of the food had changed and it hasn't. Sweet potato lukewarm a lot of gristle and a very chewy ribeye. Couldn't even start our salad and chili before the steaks were brought out.   Guess we won't be back again. Maybe because were old who knows"}
{"text":"I love this location in particular! The manager- Edmonda- really goes above and beyond to make sure that every guest has the best experience. When I've dined here in the past and had less than a stellar meal (which is very rare, considering how often I visit), she has made sure to make everything right again! Tonight while I was dining, she made the extra effort to make a little girl smile and even invited her to dance with the staff! It was really awesome to watch! She is one of the most amazing managers I have encountered in as long as I can remember! Another great thing about tonight's experience was our server, Desiree! Even though we practically closed the restaurant down, she was smiling and kind the whole night! She was very attentive and we never had to ask for a refill or wonder where she was! I've worked in restaurants before, and Desiree certainly has figured out how to be amazing! Anyways, major props to the both of them, and the whole team at this location! Never have I ever left dissatisfied (or hungry haha)! This place is my favorite, thanks to the amazing staff and wonderful food!!!"}
{"text":"This location is better than metrocenter. I wasn't to pleased with our waiter. but, hey! you win some you loose some. Food was alright."}
{"text":"3 strikes and your out!! this is my 3rd visit to a Texas roadhouse here in PHX area and they all suck! Food served cold, Ribs left over from the nite before served to the early diners and are cold, DRY, DRY, DRY! and awash in sauce to mask it all!! TOO Bad as the concept is great!, never again for those prices I will go somewhere good!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Texas Roadhouse.  I've been coming to Texas Roadhouse for about 6 years and I've never had a bad experience.  The service, food, and prices are all wonderful!  Some of my favorites are the country fried chicken, any of burgers, steaks: rib eye, prime rib and even the sirloin steaks are all delicious. It just depends on what cut of meat you want. The entree's usually come with two sides. I like the mashed potatoes with white gravy or the loaded sweet potatoes.    I can't forget to mention the complimentary buns with cinnamon spread while you are waiting for your food!   The sweet tea is always a winner here if you like sweet tea."}
{"text":"My confidence in this location has gone down. I work right down the street from this location and come more than four times a month. They have been out of the beer on tap that my co worker likes now for the try third time we have been here.  We will be calling to make sure they have what we want before coming again."}
{"text":"The service at this location is lacking. They *can't* do anything you want, but say it with a smile. They *can't* seat you unless everyone is at the restaurant at the same time. They *can't* honor a Texas Roadhouse coupon from another location. They *can't* cook the kids steak bites less than well done, because they are so small. And, they *can't* cook the 6oz steak off of the kids menu less than medium well. I am over it..."}
{"text":"Love this place! First time at the one in Arizona, but the service here was really good. Wendy was our sever & she was extremely attentive. Never had to ask for a refill or repeat anything. Ordered the 10 oz prime rib with a side of mashed potatoes & a Caesar salad. It was delicious & cooked just right! Looked forward to the bread, it was fresh & hot! The cinnamon butter! Ugh. Delicious. My husband got the bone in ribeye & the loaded mashed potatoes & it was really good & full of flavor! Can't say a bad thing about this place. Service from the moment we walked in the door & out was amazing!"}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong for the price but its not high end either.  Ribs & Sirloin usually pretty good."}
{"text":"On a recent dinner at the Peoria Texas Roadhouse, the bill folder was returned to me with someone else's VISA card inside. I immediately looked for our waitress but it took a few minutes to track her down. After explaining the error, she ran to find the owner of the card, but that person had already left. The waitress told her manager, who had no idea what to do. I told the manager to contact the number on the back of the other card to contact that cardholder and get her back to the restaurant.  During the hour that passed while waiting for this issue to be resolved, no one offered us beverages, or dessert, or anything to make the waiting less irritating. And when the other cardholder finally returned, the manager was going to charge us for the dinner!   I refused to pay and all the manager had to say was, \"OK.\"  Inexperienced  and discourteous staff make this Texas Roadhouse a restaurant we'll never patronize again."}
{"text":"Cassie our server did a magnificent job she was always ahead of the thing she brought food before we were ready for it she brought drinks before they were empty it was delightful the food was also very good very filling"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when I walked in to this restaurant.  I drive by it frequently and it looks always packed.  There is more room inside than I thought.  Large booths for parties of six (or eight if your group is skinny).  High tops and bar counters for smaller parties.  Looks like a Rodehouse with animal heads and other manly things.  Lots of TVs around.  They did have Packer and Badger banners up ( know your crowd ).  Peanut shells are everywhere.  In the holding area, in the bar, in the dining room.  Sliding into the booth was kinda hard with the sandals I was wearing as my feet kept slipping from my footing.  As I checked in on YELP, there was an offer for a free Cactus Blossom.  It was really just like the Blooming Onion, or Awesome Blossom at other locations.  I was not a fan of the sauce in the middle.  But it was very nice they offered something to Yelp customers to try.    This restaurant is really known for reasonably priced cuts of steak.  I ordered the Fort Worth Ribeye.  It was cooked well and it had a nice seasoning.  My two sides was a side salad of good size and the veggie of the day.  Two others in my group got the sirloin.  Those looked plump and cooked very well.    One person in the party ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich ( which he stated he has had before) but there was a concern with the meat in the sandwich.  He found it either full of gristle or overcooked to the point the meat was not deemed edible.  The manager arrived and after a brief discussion, the meal was removed from the bill.  As my friend had eaten his sides, he didn't want to order an new entrée.  As we were getting ready to pay the bill, the manager walked back to the table with a free meal coupon.  I felt the manager and staff handled the concern very well.  All in all, it's a chain restaurant.  It's theme is a bit much for me and I'm not sure I would be a regular at this type of place.  But they have wonderful customer service and a decently priced menu so I would be happy to recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonable steak dinner."}
{"text":"I have a most pleasurable dining experience on my Friday night visit.  Arrived just slightly before 7pm to a busy place.  Fortunately I did not have to wait and was immediately seated.  Had a wonderful server that was friendly, pleasant, bubbly and added to the enjoyment of being here.  Upon being seated I was provided was hot rolls and a cinnamon butter and a bucket of peanuts in the shell. (and yes you are encouraged to throw the shells on the floor!)  I ordered the 12 oz. Ft. Worth Ribeye with mashed potatoes and applesauce.  My server mentioned that all food is fresh and made on premises, and all of the steaks are hand cut.  If you like, as you enter the restaurant there is a display case and you can select your own steak.  I also had a front row seat for the hourly line dance done by the servers.  The meal was delicious.  As some other reviewers have said, if you want the upscale experience there are plenty of those type places in the area.  If you are looking for a side order of fun, I would suggest this place."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place is always too loud.  Went there with my Dad (93) for a Christmas treat and was hard to talk, and it was a week day evening.   Food was good as was the service."}
{"text":"This is no doubt the best Texas Roadhouse in the valley. They have excellent service. We love Bailey, she attended and anticipated everything we needed, she was friendly and were all smiles the entire time. We're from Glendale and we drive all the way to this branch for the Firecracker Shrimp, they dont have it at all other Texas Roadhouse near our place and it is something worth driving 45 mins for.   My husband had Rib Eye & Shrimp cooked to perfection. They cooked it the way he wanted which was Medium. I had the Bbq Roasted Half Chicken with Ribs corn and sweet potatoes on the side. Their free dinner rolls are always loved, we get 3 baskets every time and make sure we have something to take home with our left overs. :)  If you happen to be in this town or had to buy something from Ikea, I really recommend going by. Try the Firecracker Shrimp too, because it is amazing! I hope they put that on the regular menu soon so it'll be available in other branches :)"}
{"text":"Ordered a steak well done had it come out all FAT... talked to the manager who had another one made for us, didn't eat it but wrapped it up to go... go home to eat later and it was the pinkest I've ever seen a steak. If I would have seen that there I probably would have had a melt down, like seriously your a steak house and you manage to screw up both my steaks. Our drinks came out very slow, my boyfriends ribs were forgot and my loaded potato wasn't loaded. horrible experience . I knew we should have just went to Olive Garden, they never disappoint. And to be honest the bread an butter there is overrated!! Who wants sweet butter? (barf)"}
{"text":"Went here for a special occasion. I ordered a rib-eye steak, my wife got the chicken and ribs, and my mother got the steak kabobs. My rib-eye came seared, but completely raw in the middle. My wife's chicken was very chewy, almost as if it were cooked from frozen. After cutting into my steak, I sent it back. They put the same steak on the grill (which I thought they could never re-fire food like that), then the manager brought it back to me. I cut into another part of the steak and it was still raw. My wife then sent the chicken back because it was so chewy and quite undesirable after seeing my steak. My mothers kabobs were edible, still slightly under cooked,(her appetite also quickly went away) but she didn't want to complain. The manger apologized slightly insincerely and asked if she could bring us something else. I declined, because my appetite was lost at this point. The manager told us she was sorry and took the two meals off, but still had the audacity to charge me for the 3rd meal, and all drinks and add on's. I would have expected her to comp the whole meal (which I could car less really) and ask for my return business. The waitress kind of disappeared after this all started happening, as if she didn't really know how to handle the situation. This was a week day, afternoon..... They weren't busy and there should have been plenty opportunity for quality control. Needless to say, I won't be going back.... I'd rather drive the distance to a restaurant that cares more about the quality of the product they provide, rather then care about dancing to some song every 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Best service at the Gilbert/Germann intersection!  We go here all the time cuz we know the food and it's always good and the service is AWESOME.  Never have any problems.  Managers always come greet you and everyone is friendly.  They probably know us by now we come there so much, but always ask if we've been there before :D  Sweet tea's always cold, food's always hot and cooked right. Go for the Early Dine and everything is way cheaper!"}
{"text":"The main thing I like about Texas Roadhouse is the early-bird special.  Arrived about 5:15pm and there was a wait of about 15 minutes.  Super narrow walkways and lots of activity made movement to our table a bit difficult.  Older people with walkers had a very hard time getting around.  We were greeted immediately by our server.  She brought us our drinks and some rolls, and took our order.  We all ordered from the early bird menu.  Overall, the food was pretty good, and certainly enough.  All food arrived as ordered and expected.  Our server refilled our drinks several times without being prompted.  She also brought a to-go order for our son as we were finishing our meal.  Overall, good food, excellent price, good service."}
{"text":"Wait staff is courteous, prompt, and down to earth. The steak was medium as requested and had the perfect amount of pink to my liking. Been to other locations and the steaks are consistently well prepared. No complaints other than it get a bit noisy but that atmosphere is lively so no complaint there. Will be back anytime I get a chance."}
{"text":"I have been here several times.  I don't personally like it but my husband likes going here for steak.  The place is very crowded and cramped. When I am ordering, the waitresses always give me several additional options of how to have the food (ie potato) but states it as a run-on so I am always confused where the break is.  The last time we were there,  I ordered a sweet potato (planned to give to my 11 month old).  The waitress listed 6 toppings, without breaking.  I said I wanted the minimal.  I was given a sweet potato with 3 unnecessary toppings.  They had a high chair for us but it was far away from the table and had very loose straps that didn't work for my daughter. I ended up having to keep her in my lap during our visit."}
{"text":"Not impressed.   Although it was a Saturday night (11/10/12 - 7:00 p.m.) and we did expect a wait, I was not prepared for a rude hostess when I after 30 minutes of a 40 minute expected wait time I was told I still have 10 minutes as she initially told me.  I was simply wondering where on the list we might be falling as I saw people being seated rather quickly.   Seating seemed to be a problem as we were called and then left standing in the walkway with no 'seaters' available.  Then, as the group doing this task arrived, it appeared something else was much more important in conversation rather than seating four people who were just told it was their turn.  Although, the group selected AFTERWARDS were seated promptly.  I ordered the 10 oz Ribeye and honestly, I could have selected better.  This meal was full of gristle and not prepared to my liking in the slightest bit.  The vegetable serving was completely overcooked.   I truly am not a fan of this place and where I live - there are hundreds of other steakhouse choices that I will be visiting instead."}
{"text":"I been coming here since it opened at this location & I must say it is by far the best out of the others I been to. Believe me I been to a lot. My first Roadhouse experience The first thing that stuck out was the ambience with the peanut shell's all over floor that gave it a comfortable vibe(which they don't do no more) , sure the smells from the hot rolls out the oven to the fall off the bone ribs bbq chicken loaded bake potatoes chili etc. & lets not forget the main Steak. Prepared to your preference. What makes this particular spot stand above the rest is the combination of the food service price(early Bird dinner before 6 deals) & good energy from every single one. If that don't do it you can always drink, Bar is legit"}
{"text":"Normally a great place to eat a late dinner. But tonight our late night dinner was spoiled by sub par service that left my cup empty for about 10 minutes and our service provider never check on us until the after the main course was partially provided... Yes I say partially as not all the food came out at once ... Not sure if I will revisit this establishment"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars. When my husband and I are in the mood for a sit down meal that doesn't take a lot of time we would come here. My problem is with their kitchen staff. I have never had a decently cooked steak, EVER!!!!! My steaks are always undercooked. I am by no means a \"well done\" kind of girl. I like my steaks around medium and it seems that when I get my order it is always rare."}
{"text":"Good basic steak and chicken. Good for families. Not a place if you want to hold a conversation - very noisy with loud country music. Tasty hot rolls with cinnamon honey butter."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite place to have dinner with the family. Great service and the bread along with the rest of the appetizers just hits the spot. The steaks is perfectly cooked accompanied by a great selection of side such as their loaded sweet potato and hearty chili."}
{"text":"I went there for a retirement dinner. The waiter made a rude comment to me about my weight. Upset me, but hey cant help rude people. Overall food is good and price is good."}
{"text":"We were hungry for steak but didn't want to spend a fortune or get dressed up.  I enjoyed the 6 oz  filet which was cooked perfectly medium rare.  Hubby enjoyed his ribeye although it was thinly cut which is not his preference.  It also was cooked to order and came with a skewer of shrimp that was very good.  The noise level was quite loud with waiters hollering hee haw every so often which was obnoxious, but we got exactly what we expected."}
{"text":"Who doesnt love Texas Roadhouse?! Sweet damn honey cinnamon butter!! those things are basically the only reason why i come to any Texas Roadhouse (TRH)!! and i bring some home for a reheated treat..  I usually order the Caesar chicken salad, they have good big croutons, ultra-cold plates, the cheese and dressing are usually well mixed..  Sometimes the waitresses can be a dud, but i havent had much of those in my experience, thankfully! (my first experience was in 2007 in Indianapolis and ive been hooked ever since.. frequented TRH in Boston, NYC, Long Island, Austin, and now Mesa!)  my boyfriend's father had a birthday at this location back in October, and we requested a slice of cake for him. The waitress forgot the cake(i dont blame her, she was overwhelmed with a lot of people and our 8 guests wanted to separate checks- ugh). While we waited a bit for the cake.. we were agitated because we couldnt surprise the birthday dude since he knew what we were waiting for.. at last the cake came.. holy lordy a whole cake of cheesecake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was pissed at first because it looked like it came from FRYS and it cost $14 dollars.. i thought i would have to pay for it and i just wanted a tiny slice of cake or dessert for him, free like most restaurants do... ANYWAYS the point is.. the whole damn cake was FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was confused but i did not complain..   SO despite some confusion and wait.. this place is GREAT!  peanuts all around, cold beer.. and surely free cake for your birthday?!  have a good one!"}
{"text":"Always great food, awesome atmosphere, and the music is perfect as usual.  The staff on Veterans Day was impeccable! Yes there were a lot of people but that is because the food is always just as you asked for it!"}
{"text":"Very noisy atmosphere.  Wife had to send back ribeye steak twice.  Seems cooks can't figure out what medium well is but got it right the third time they presented to my wife.  Food quality slightly above average for chain Resturant. If you come here to talk to old friends they won't hear you. Service was good. No reservations but they have call ahead that sends you a text msg. Gave it a three as it is slightly above average."}
{"text":"Great appetizer (rattlesnake bikes, wings and potato skins). Great ribeye (10oz). Amazing drinks (cowboy and hurricane margarita). Great service. Im a longhorn fan but i think Texas Roadhouse has become my favorite steak place from this one visit. I really enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Live in Surprise and deceided to try this location out finally hoping the excitment of it opening up would die down the wait. We arrived at 5:45 and was seated right away. The food on the other hand was not very good. I ordered the New York strip steak and the steak had no taste and it seemed like every bite was chewy. My wife ordered the steak kabob which she sent back. I had a taste of it as well and also was disappointed. I will try Texas Roadhouse one more time in Surprise since I live there but if we have the same experience we will not be going to that one anymore."}
{"text":"This place is ok but the last time I came here they overcooked my steak and cleared my table while I was in the restroom. I hadn't even paid yet. I was told that some people walk out without paying. If you're eating alone don't go to the bathroom until you're done eating I guess, unless you'd like to come back to your table with your food gone and have other customers stare at you like you're a criminal when the waitress explains to you very loudly why your table is empty."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night. Won't be back for quite awhile. Our server was a young female who knew nothing about the menu or customer service! I ordered the prime rib , medium and it came well done. Cold potato, the cheese wouldn't even melt. Husband ordered the ribeye and it too was cooked well done. Yuck! We ordered Chili instead of salad, when it didn't come out we asked the waitress and she said she brings it out with the meal... Usually it's brought out when the salads are brought out, so she went and got them. Seconds late here came our dinner with more chili...she asked of we wanted it, we told her no, then she went to the table behind us and asked if they wanted it. She told them not to tell anyone she did that and then came back and took the chili from our table and gave it to them.  Needless to say our food was not up to par, not was our service or experience!"}
{"text":"My sister and her boyfriend took me here for my birthday and we all had a great time. Call ahead seating let us walk right in past a large waiting crowd and we were seated within just a few minutes of our arrival. Even though it was busy our server was on top of her game and took really good care of us. I wish I had gotten her name in case we come back here because she was really good and we would want her as our server again. All our steaks were tender and juicy and cooked just right. My wife said her salmon was flaky and tender and cooked just right as well. All sides were good and we love the yeast rolls with the honey butter. The only hiccup of the night was my sisters boyfriend's steak was over blackened to the point he could not eat it and had he to order another one, but one of the managers comped  him his steak for that. Other than my sister getting the staff the staff the sing Happy Birthday while I sat in a saddle, we all had a great time and a few Texas size margaritas helped with that! We have always had good food and service at any Texas Roadhouse we have visited (except the one in Hickory, NC-see review) and this one did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Rachel was an amazing waitress! If you go there, request Rachel because she made the experience worth while! Would definitely go back and request her. She made sure our drinks were always full, never forgot anything, and accommodated us perfectly for my Grandma's birthday. Thanks, Rachel!"}
{"text":"Veterans Day- free meal for vets.  Arrived about 11:30 am, had a wait of about 1 hour, but the staff managed the crowd very well. Every space taken, yet service was great and very prompt, our server Julie was a jewel!  Fast efficient and sincerely thanked my husband as a veteran. Steak was very good and tender as always(our 5th visit, and we live 50'miles away) A definite must on our list of affordable and enjoyable dining out."}
{"text":"Really this location does not even deserve 1/2 a star. We love Texas Roadhouse but the service at this location. Is beyond bad"}
{"text":"I have not been to Texas Road House in years. I always enjoyed the food but after a bad experience with a waitress I stopped going. Last night we were riding looking for a restaurant to and ended up here. Omg I have been missing out. I don't even have pictures because as soon as the plates touched the table we dove in. When We walked in we were greeted with smiles and friendly hostesses. Before being seated I picked my choice of meat and was provided with a ticket to give to the server. Our waiter Cory was awesome, he was friendly and attentive. I ordered steak with mashed potatoes and rice, the potions were large and I enough to take home for lunch. The food came out piping hot and my steak was cooked to perfection, I didn't need steak sauce. The bread is by far the best I really had control myself because I could have eaten the entire basket. We had a party of 4 and we all left satisfied. The price was great and worth it. This will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"For a Saturday night, the wait was only 15 minutes. Our server was excellent and the food was consistently good."}
{"text":"We come here every quarter for lunch to split, the meal is always what we expect. The week we got the New York strip and it was actually very tasty. The loaded sweet potatoes are the real reason we frequent this location as typically try to stay away from corporate restaurants. If you plan to go don't go for a quiet experience, always loud and energetic."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Texas Roadhouse! My go-to here is the prime rib with creamy horseradish sauce. Only once in all the years have I been coming here were they sold out of it. I feel like it rivals Longhorns, and for a little less money. Plus you can't beat the butter and rolls! The mashed potatoes here are some of the best I've ever had, too."}
{"text":"Food was good, and very affordable!  Birthday singing was obnoxiously loud! Not great if you've got babies and old fogies in yer party, pardner! But, them sweet taters, n sweet tea was tasteeeee!  Mmmm, mmmm. I'm only knocking it down on the rating due to the noise being insane!!! However,  we had one in our party who was a lil picky about her prime rib, and the manager was courteous and prompt about offering a new cut, and fresh sides! Great customer service on the manager's part! Just be forewarned,  if you're looking for a quiet dinner spot around 8pm on a Friday night, best keep yer boots in the dust and keep steppin!"}
{"text":"If you plan on dining here on a weekend night call and get a place in line.  That said this is one of my most favorite restaurants for the best steaks ever.  My young daughters love the food and the great atmosphere!  Don't miss this restaurant if you're looking for a kick back, casual restaurant that has supreme steaks!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience for a mothers day lunch. They crammed us in a corner where they shoved industrial metal tables with picnic table covers...  Literally sat 32 people in an area they would normally sit 16 people. Way understaffed and over crowded showing they only care about top line sales, not customer service. Probably should call the fire Marshall to see this as I have to keep moving my baby seat whenever the table next to us needs to go to the bathroom. Good news is we have been here 45 minutes and I have not gotten to eat yet...  Guess this is an all day experience today..."}
{"text":"Dont be fooled by the other steak houses this place has always been consistent great service great food and its affordable for a family to experience a nice steak house. Ive been eating here at least 10 years great place."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere was good. The prices were reasonable as the portions were not huge, but acceptable. I dont care for how their menu does not reflect the prices for adult beverages. I should not have to ask or be surprised when the check arrives. We probably had most boring server ever... who shall go nameless. ZERO personality!! Texas Roadhouse obviously requires their servers to learn scripts as her responses to our questions/order were obviously taught, canned and rehearsed. I like to have fun when eating out and that typically includes friendly interaction with my server. Just give me a friendly and genuine personality... no robots please!"}
{"text":"My wife and I loved Texas Roadhouse in Cumming, Georgia.  I'm happy to report this location is just as good.   This chain is really consistent.  They seem to have their game figured out.  Service was excellent, but I forgot the name of the server.  Oops!  We ordered the All American burger and Chicken Critters.  The food was excellent and the price was right.    The place was pretty crowded, but we only waited about 3 minutes.    We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"O how I love to eat ribeye.  The juiciness in your mouth is so...wait, wait...I'm getting ahead of myself here.  Let's save the food for last!  Texas Roadhouse, always a casual dining experience.  Want something to munch on while waiting on a table?  Go ahead and grab some peanuts!  I'm not a peanut kind of person, but if I was, I would enjoy that little detail.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere with some swanky decorations found around the place.  The country music playing in the background as well made me feel like a country girl inside.    The staff there is pleasant to serve you.  I have always walked in and been greeted with a smile from the hostess, even when it has been crazy busy and hectic in the waiting area.  A fact that I love about when the employees seat us is that they do not seem to judge me when ask for 2 cups of butter for my rolls that they grab when seating people.  Okay okay...the good stuff now.  Food.  Let me start off in order.  The rolls are BOMB.  The employees always grab a basket of rolls when seating you, so you're sure to have something else to munch on while waiting for your server.  My favorite appetizer are the rattlesnake bites.  Jalapenos and cheese battered and fried!  You just can't go wrong with that.  I order a Cesar salad, standard.  Then my ribeye comes into view, looking succulent as always.  I drool as soon as I see that sexy piece of meat coming my way.  The first bite is delightful as always.    I would tots recommend this Texas Roadhouse location for a fun and casual dining experience in the Matthews area.  Yee-haw!  *tips hat*"}
{"text":"Hit and miss. I do go often because it good more often than not. There have been times when I ordered my rib-eye medium and it came to me still mooing. I'm hesitant to send it back to the kitchen so I always say it's fine, take it home and throw it on the grill. However, the quality of the food is good and the service is usually average to good, but never bad. Outback was my favorite at one point in time. Not now though. Roadhouse has them beat. Longhorn is under quality and over priced. I'll stay with Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Food was great Server was great Except for the loud clapping by my ear and the loud singing the staff do all the sudden which interrupts your conversation and very annoying, that was uncalled for"}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Came here after church, the ribs were cold,silverware and plates and cups were FILTHY.  NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"We called in 30 minutes early,  walked in on time,  they took us immediately to our table. Fast service,  very good waitress,  food was awesome,  we both had sirloin steaks.  I love this place,  will definetely return. ...I highly suggest early call in,  otherwise it's a long wait.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Went here for my friends birthday dinner and even though I am that one person that always orders fish at a steak house. Texas Roadhouse cooked it right! I would have given 5 stars for the cooked perfection but our server was not very attentive. My husband had the fall off the bone ribs and as far as I know everyone enjoyed their meals. Would definitely return, the price is outstanding and the food was great."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome every time I come here we have a great time And the waitress kimberly Couldn't ask for better waitress"}
{"text":"I have visited this location several times. I don't know what's up but this location has poor service.    This is my second time in one week I have tried to place a pick up order and have been transferred and placed on hold for 2.5 minutes plus.    Lost patience after long hold times.  Ultimately never placed an order."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and the service is top notch. Josh made our experience really great. We will definitely be going back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"As many times as I have eaten at Texas Roadhouse tonight was probably the worst disappointment that I can imagine. I sat and waited for over an hour to be called watching people that just walked in walked right past me to get a table. I was told upon checking in at the desk that it would be a 15 to 30 minute wait. I download the Yelp app. And proceeded to see that there were 9 parties ahead of me. Then down to one. I asked the girl at the door where I was on the list, to be told I was next.  Three couples came ahead then, one after another.  My other half asked asy the desk and was told we had not checked in... um not true. Then as he tried to speak three person at the desk did not let him speak.   The customer service representative wad very unprofessional.  Cutting him off every time because he was upset.  I could not believe the service.  As it had always been impeccable. I don't know if I can come back to service like this."}
{"text":"I don't mean this to be necessarily negative, but Texas Roadhouse isn't so much a restaurant as it is a human foie gras farm.  My best friend and I love coming here on Friday nights, despite the crazy long wait time and crowds. The anticipation, hunger and stress of waiting only adds to the relief and elation when we are finally taken to one of the comfy 2-person booths and commence stuffing our faces with the first of a million dinner rolls with cinnamon butter.   Fried Pickles? Awesome.  Loaded Mashed Potatoes? OMG.  Getting Loaded Mashed Potatoes AND a Baked Sweet Potato with cinnamon butter and brown sugar as your two sides, AFTER stuffing yourself with a million rolls and cinnamon butter? Priceless.  I am always surprised when the bill comes, because it's always way less than I think it's going to be.   But then again, by the time I waddle my Texas-sized, stuffed self to my car afterwards, I have to say \"Never Again!\", but... by the following week, I get the visions of sugar rolls dancing in my head and then we find ourselves back in line...  Other than the dirty, peanutty floors, stressed out staff, earbud-bursting country music, waiting in line in a cramped, claustrophobic hallway to nowhere and terrible margaritas, this place is awesome!  P.S. - Please don't come here on your birthday. It stresses everyone else out when the entire restaurant staff is doing their song and clappy dance ON TOP OF the terrible PA music."}
{"text":"Only have been a couple of times in the past 5 years and the service was good but the food is just okay. My husband and I shared a dinner together since we are on a budget.  Had an onion blossom (small taste of burnt oil), dinner salad (which they lost the ticket for the order and brought it out after we got our dinner). Food getting cold while we ate our salad and the portion size of the meal wasn't that great, a small piece of chicken, little bowl of mashed potatoes and veggies."}
{"text":"Pros:  -those rolls! OMG the rolls! The butter is a delightful concoction of cinnamon sugar and the rolls themselves are golden, soft and glazed with...butter! So good! No need for an appetizer -food and side dishes were all surprisingly well seasoned and hit all the right taste buds. My country fried chicken was perfectly crispy and my hubby's order of steak medallions were hella tasty! Even his green beans were juicy and filled with bacon bits. Mmmmm...You won't get innovation but you will get satisfaction here -waitresses here were really personable and friendly.  -ambiance is pretty dark and a little obnoxious with all the random yelling and dancing. As a novelty, it was fun at first but I can see how it gets old real fast.  Cons: -this must be the only place people from a 15-mile radius eat out at. We actually had to go to another restaurant this one Sunday night because it was just too packed. We ended up picking a Wednesday night but lo and behold, there was another 35-min wait! I tried calling ahead but their phone lines were down that day :(. The message on the line also said they don't take reservations. The popularity here is a little ridiculous. I guess if I come here again, it'll have to be on a Monday at 4pm or something."}
{"text":"One of the best steaks I ever had came from an old restaurant chain called Sambo's. Gone now except for the original location in Santa Barbara, Sambo's was a high quality, very nice coffee shop type restaurant. Kinda like a Denny's but better. Way.  Sambo's gave me a top 5 steak experience. While it was cooked on a flat top it had that nice crusty outside, tender, juicy, flavorful... Bliss.  The \"Roadhouse\" is the Denny's of steakhouses. A well oiled machine they get you in, stuffed with hot bread, out the door and your money in their pocket quickly and efficiently. Busy, noisy, energetic... The kind of place where, while it's so loud you can't have a conversation with the person across the table from you... but you can hear every word from the people three tables over. Yep, you know... \"those people.\"  Here, like Denny's, simple is better. Get the biggest steak they have, cooked as raw as you can tolerate it (they're going to cook it Medium anyways) with a salad and a potato. Oh, and for flavor slather it with their own steak sauce. They have managed to create a sauce with the essence of cooked steak drippings. Actually the best thing on the table. Good luck. Have fun. Oh, and two stars for COLD BEER. Whohoo!  Lord I miss Sambo's... Yummmmm"}
{"text":"Steaks don't have much flavor. Better when I make them at home with butter, garlic, salt, and pepper. Usually cooked pretty perfect, the rolls and sides are awesome. Good customer service. But for the price, learn how to season your own steaks and spend half the money with a much better steak at home. Just my 2 cents."}
{"text":"Yeah, I've mentioned that TR's are not consistent from location to location. This one is not one of the good ones. Waters taste like they never clean the equipment. Meals not prepared as well as expected."}
{"text":"Considering adding this one to my \"won't return\" list which already includes the TR off 83rd Ave south of Bell and the one off Happy Valley east of 17. Here's why:   Rib eye was the thinnest steak this side of Golden Coral. Maybe it was because we arrived about an hour before close and their better cuts had sold off. Don't know. But, it was ordered medium rare. The first knife cut showed medium well. But, it was on an outer edge. Maybe the temp would improve further in? Nope. Went to well done. By that time, enough had been eaten so as to be unfair to send it back.  On the good side, the pulled pork dinner was its usual good quality and flavor. Same for the house margarita.  The server was friendly and sporadically attentive. I think she was ready to be done. To-go boxes were offered pretty early. No attempt to sell a second margarita. And, no attempt to sell dessert.  Note to management: The \"do you want fries and a Coke with that line\" is food service 101. A server should always attempt to sell a 2nd round (unless the patron is already visibly affected by the alcohol) and always should suggest dessert!  I remain a fan of TR. But, I'm refining my list of which locations really deliver - perhaps their model doesn't really fit the \"typical\" Sun City crowd? The experience was not the same and it was \"only\" 9 p.m. on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Yeah, um no. Not this one.  I like Texas Roadhouse. If I'm in an area of town and I'm not sure where to eat, Texas Roadhouse will be something I'd seek out. But, not this one.  Took me a while to realize they are consistent in their inconsistencies.  So, they have two taps for water. Apparently, this speeds things up so they can fill more glasses more quickly. But, it seems like they never clean the tap on one of them. We always get one fresh water that tastes fine and the other tastes like metal. We comment - after the fact because I can never remember...until now - and they've never addressed the issue after months.  Chicken fried steak at this one allows them to \"hide\" the deficiencies of the cut. This time there was a huge vein from end to end. Gross.   Finally in my memory bank. Not going back to this one. Still happy with several other Valley locations."}
{"text":"Straight up happy with this location. Time it right and there isn't a wait. Time it wrong, and, well, don't fill up on the free peanuts!  Very friendly staff. Server was prompt to the table. House marg is a good deal. And, for those who don't drink a lot, you can actually taste the tequila! The chili is great. The pulled pork was prepared very well and was a generous portion especially for the $.   This TR is a definite Come Here restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not all TR's in the Valley are created equal. This is one of the good ones.  Always amazing value for the money. Well prepared steaks. House marg is a steal of a deal."}
{"text":"Been to enough of these locations around the Valley to have learned that either there are different franchise owners or that the GM's of these restaurants have widely varying standards.  Exceptionally pleased with this location time after time. I've just stopped ordering ribs from here as well as any number of other steak places in town. I guess my tastes run different.  Arrived after 9 p.m. on a weeknight. Greeted and seated right away. Server was nearby and apologized for taking so long to get to us. Huh? She was there in a couple minutes.  It's hot so I let her know I'd be drinking a lot of water. Smart server: she brought extra glasses. Made us both happy.  Huge qty of pulled pork served hot! Great side of chili. I like it so much I asked for 2 of them as my 2 sides. Didn't even flinch. Just served what I'd ordered.  We drive past the location off of Happy Valley as well as the one on the west side around Bell off 101 to come to this one even though it adds 15-30 minutes more driving.  $6 house marg is a good deal. I don't drink often so I can actually taste the tequila without paying extra for a kicker."}
{"text":"A Texas Roadhouse customer for many years. First visit to this location. Arrived around 6:30 on Saturday of Memorial weekend. Parking lot full and I was stressing how long the wait would be. Thankfully, there was no line.   We were seated immediately. The place was busy, but not full. Strange that the hostess did not grab hot bread on our way to our table. A waitress greeted us promptly and took drink orders. A runner served the drinks pretty fast. Bread arrived after a request for it to be brought to us.  And then ... the wait began. It was close to 10 minutes before our server appeared again to take dinner orders. Thankfully that was really the only glitch.  Country fried sirloin cooked to order was flavorful and not overdone with breading or gravy. Much - much! - better than TexAZ in Phoenix! Pulled pork dinner was plentiful and flavorful. The chili on the side was disappointing this time. The beef bits were chewy and not very plentiful. Fries were OK, very salty and got cold fast. Baked potato always comes with too much soft butter and too much sour cream but both can be scooped to the side. I don't like that they rub the skin with salt (sea salt, I believe). Makes it so I won't eat it.  Texas Roadhouse is very clean and consistent from location to location across several states. Yes, it's a chain. So what? I believe them to be the best in category. Light years ahead of what Outback has become. And, so much better than Logan's I don't get the comparison at all. Good portion sizes and good value for the money."}
{"text":"Service was great. Savannah was top shelf.  Chicken fried steak was butchered poorly and had a tendon in the middle of the cut.  Sides of chili were a miss. The pieces of meat were cut poorly and were chewy. The cheese was excessive and gluey.   Skip the burger. Sear was actually more like burned. Well done and not by request.  House marg is a great deal and didn't disappoint. I have a nice buzz.  Worth another try. Going to go with my tried and true pulled pork."}
{"text":"Had a very solid meal here tonight!  My mom was in town and she was hanging out at one of the casinos with her friends.  We wanted to get together for dinner, so her friend suggested this place.  It was close enough to both of us (me in Surprise, my moms friend in Buckeye) that it worked out.  We arrived at around 6:30pm and were seated right away.  Waiting for us on the table were 2 baskets of bread and a pail of peanuts.  I had some peanuts, they had some bread, we placed our orders for our drinks and then for our meals.  I went with the Steakhouse Filet Salad.  Here is how it was...........  Steakhouse Filet Salad-  This salad came with greens, tomatoes, blue cheese crumbles, Italian and blue cheese dressings as well as a whole (probably 6oz) filet on top.  The steak was cooked a perfect medium and was as tender as could be.  I hadn't had a filet mignon in quite some time, and I really enjoyed this one.  The greens were crisp and fresh and they hooked it up with the blue cheese crumbles!  I mixed and mashed everything together and went to town on it.  It was a great salad!  I would not hesitate to order it again.  Not the cheapest salad I have ever had ($13.99), but you do get a ton of filet, so it was definitely worth the cost.  One of the better salads I have had in the past year or so!   I also had some of my moms food.  She ordered an 8oz top sirloin and shrimp combo.  She gave me a couple of shrimp and about half her steak.  My mom got her steak medium rare and it was perfectly cooked!  It had nice char marks on it and was seasoned very well! My moms friends seemed to enjoy their meals, too!  Everyone was happy!   Service was pretty good.  Our waitress wasn't the best waitress ever, but she did her job and didn't mess anything up.  The manager even came by to check on us and see how we liked everything.  I also had a run in with another male employee.  He was coming out of the bathroom (tight space near a wall kind of) and saw me heading towards it.  Instead of squeezing by me real quick, he stepped back and held the door open for me so I could go straight ahead first.  It was a small gesture, but nowadays, people don't have manners or do things like that worth a shit anymore.  I really appreciated it!  Will I be back?  Yes, I will definitely come back at some point in the future.  Low carb options are readily available, the steaks were very tasty, and the price was pretty reasonable.  It was a good meal out with my mom and her friends!"}
{"text":"As you can see from the reviews, consistency IS the issue! When it is good, it is very good. But when they have a bad night, it can be amazingly bad. We've experienced both, and I am suspicious that someone is mishandling credit cards, so I pay in cash."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken with sweet potato and chili... HOLY CRAP THE CHILI IS GROSS!!!  I swear they went to Costco and bought some big ol cans of Hormel canned chili and warmed it up on the stove. Seriously the chili is NOT GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't quite made up my mind on how I feel about the good ol' texas roadhouse. On one hand, the food is incredible! Talk about some good bread rolls. I usually put butter on those buns but sometimes- when I'm feeling crazy- I but honey on that bread and it's so good! Mmmmmmm! But on the other hand, I cannot eat at Texas roadhouse without being hospitalized! Talk about a bummer! I am very allergic to peanuts, and I carry two epi-pens on me at all times! One in my car, and the other in my pocket. T roadhouse is coated in that nasty peanut powder! I want to eat there but it'll kill me!"}
{"text":"Omg I love this place! Amazing food amazing service ....ALWAYS!!! My favorite is the bone in rib eye with mashed potatoes and green beans! I order this every time!"}
{"text":"Great food for the price, everyone is friendly and with a smile. Family eviroment very nice on Friday or Saturday for the family."}
{"text":"Every time I visit any Texas Roadhouse the experience is always good. I mean for a general place of dining it is what's to be expected. By that I mean it's not a 5 star establishment. The food is always good and the rolls and butter are to die for! Not all the staff are as friendly as other but hey in this day and time I guess that's normal. Also I have been to several Texas Roadhouses so yea. I have also noticed at several different locations several different times the alcohol drinks seem to be on the weak side compared to others places I have been. Over all I would say a good experience and good bang for the buck. Tuesday is also kids day meaning kids eat free and can have a free item made from balloons made. You can also eat peanuts anytime any day for free and throw the shells on the floor."}
{"text":"What FUN!!! We came in for lunch to celebrate our moms birthday. Great food, great service and tons of fun!"}
{"text":"The food is good and you get friendly service but this place is SLOW! It's like the staff moves at a glacial pace. Don't go here if you are in a hurry or don't have plans after."}
{"text":"First and foremost our server was outstanding. Her name is Alicia and she had a very cheerful disposition and always showed up to our table with a smile on her face. We had a table of 9 so I know we had to of stressed her out with all our drinks and constant refills and she did a fantastic job. You couldn't see the stress of such a busy restaurant on her at all. Absolutely fantastic!!!  I had the country fried chicken. It was okay. Was kind of soft for a fried dish but the saw mill gravy was very good. My sides were seasonal veggies and mashed taters. The veggies were slightly under cooked which I don't mind in my broccoli but do mind in my carrots.   My number one down side was the fact that we did their \"call ahead\" service. I used the \"\" because when we called we were told that when we arrived to state our number and it would be about a 10 minute wait. When we got there they had trouble finding our reservation and our wait was over an hour, so I am not sure what the \"call ahead\" is for. Which I understand a 9 party can be rough, but that is also why we called ahead. So that was the biggest negative to my experience.   To you Alicia, you rock and would come back there just for you as my server!"}
{"text":"A miss. Usually like Texas Roadhouse, but this location dose not have it together. Took almost 2 hours and we ordered as soon as the waitress came to the table. Long wait for bread too. My food was cold, kids chicken not cooked, fries brown(not golden), shrimp was cold, ribs were tough, and the steaks were overly seasoned. Sorry I brought my parents here, I guess you have to be in Texas to have a good Texas Roadhouse experience."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is my favorite restaurant in Norterra. I love their steaks and all the sides. Their rolls and sweet butter are amazing. The service is always 5 stars and wouldn't ask for anything less."}
{"text":"In my opinion the best Texas Roadhouse around. The staff is very friendly and  the food is great. All the prices are very reasonable, and the portions are very good sized. I plan on to make a return to this restaurant soon."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. The food has always been good, the staff are always friendly and the servers have always been on top of things every time I come here."}
{"text":"The steak kabob was not good. Very salty. Was first brought to me very raw & very tough. They said they would re-make it, but was very well done. I suspect they nuked it & gave me the same one. Not sure why it seemed more tender"}
{"text":"Went here on Veteran's Day for the free meal for vets. I honestly had no idea they were doing in until I happened to walk past it and see the note on the door. It was a bit of a wait because they were busy. There is a ton of peanuts around if anybody is allergic to peanuts they would NOT want to come here.... I had a few of them...they were good lol. But honestly I doubt you're reading this to find out about the peanuts. I got the bbq chicken sandwich which came with fries. They also brought out a basket of fresh baked bread with cinnamon butter. I made the mistake of trying them because they are amazing. However because I ate so much of the bread, I only had room for a few bites of the sandwich and took most of it to go... it had nice flavoring though. But the bread... YUM!"}
{"text":"So very disappointed in Texas Roadhouse today. We may not ever be going back.  It's Mother's Day, so I called this morning to see if they would take a reservation. The gal on the phone said they do call ahead seating 2 hours in advance, so if we wanted to come at 5:30, call at 3:30.  3:30 rolls around and now we're being told they aren't taking seating for parties over 8 people. If we had been told that earlier, we could have made reservations elsewhere, but now we've been waiting around all day for this! Spoke to a manager who basically said 'I don't know what she told you that'  You shouldn't have people answering the phones on Mother's Day if they're not aware of the policies. They also said they couldn't accommodate us in any way. 'I can tryyyy but you'd probably be at two tables'  Now we're scrambling to find somewhere for Mother's Day and could not be more disappointed with the bad information from Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"The creepy balloon guy was there again.   This time he snuck up to our booth and stood there staring at my girlfriend and breathing heavily for about half a minute before attempting to persuade us to allow him to make her a flower or something.   I can't recommend eating somewhere that employs folks like this man."}
{"text":"For starters, I'd say that the service was great and the overall atmosphere is perfect.  My wife's steak was clearly overcooked, while both her sweet potato and my baked potato, and my vegetables were undercooked.  The \"Early Dine\" offer is a bit misleading because the $9.99 items were either $9.99 regularly, or $10.99 ... so the thought that by early dining (before 5:00p) the price would be significantly lower just isn't true.  The ploy obviously works, however, because the restaurant was pretty full of elderly couples. When we left we both gave it a grade of \"C\"."}
{"text":"Bad location! We usually go to the Metro Center store but we decided to-go to the Tempe store. We were celebrating my husbands b-day. Did a call ahead just for our party to get there and had to wait 25 mins just to get two booths in the back, back to back. how can we celebrate a b-day  while sitting separate!? The food took for ever to come out and never got the drinks. Some of us never got food! Some of the food was wrong...Then the server was stressed out or annoyed or something. Idk if she was stressed out with us or that it was a busy Friday night but it defiantly rubbed off on us and made us feel like we were the prob. I feel like she knows its a busy restaurant deal with it or dont  Asked to speak with a manager witched never showed. Idk if the server did not send for them or they just dint care enough to come see how our experience was. Will not be going to this location again.."}
{"text":"Kyle was an outstanding waiter. He was friendly and on point, even during a full house. The food was cooked well, and the beer was cold!"}
{"text":"Hello,     Yes, our menu items contain MSG.     Thank you,     Chastin Blankenship  Guest Relations Partner  Phone: 1-800-839-7623  Many people including my wife is allergic to MSG.  The better restaurants don't use it.  I have NOTHING more to say."}
{"text":"Wow. Came here for the first time tonight and was beyond impressed! The hostess asked if I'd like to select a steak on the way to being led to our seats - and had a decent selection too. Despite arriving in the last hour of business, our waiter Levi was attentive, friendly and accurate, remembering extra sauces and butters and moving quickly without rushing us. We were served hot rolls and cinnamon butter AS we were seated, and then a sampler of sides - free. Just \"Hey, check out this awesome food and make your decision WAY harder!\" Drinks followed, quickly joined by our few appetizers and main course. Healthy portions, fresh produce and their chili is awesome! No desert tonight but I'll be a new regular. The manager walked by to personally check on clients, but it was an unnecessary courtesy - we were delighted!"}
{"text":"Similar to Lone Star as far as aesthetic but way better menu options. Everything tasted awesome and the staff were super friendly. We had the southern fried chicken with gravy, was amazing. Came with two sides which was a lot!! Great portions for the price. Nice place to go for dinner."}
{"text":"My most recent visit was Veteran's Day 2016 with my father.  Every year I get to treat myself to a Veteran's Day meal, and the last few years I've chosen Texas Roadhouse.  The service was amazing. Izzy, our server, was very friendly and never let our drinks go empty.  Even though the meal was complementary we were treated with exceptional service.  The country fried sirloin was very good, and a huge portion, not to mention the (2) sides you also get to order. It's a big meal, and probably the best Veteran's Day meal in town.  Thank you Texas Roadhouse for treating myself and all the other veterans out there to a delicious free meal."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the frozen strawberry margarita with extra shot of patron! The drink was huge and perfect for summer night. I got the 6 oz filet - it was pretty darn good, but the added on grilled mushrooms I ordered were too too salty. Baked potato and caesar salad were yum - very reasonably priced steak dinner here.  Not a bad place to go, even though it was crowded, we still got a table when we walked in and service was very quick. Waitress was super nice."}
{"text":"My son and I visited the Texas Roadhouse at Power Road and Ray today and Gilbert and we're very offended. The reason why is because we ordered our food are steaks medium rare my son's came out more than medium rare it came out with hot pink in the middle we sent the steak back and it was returned to us after I had finished my complete meal. My son said it was not the waiters fault therefore he deserved a tip. I disagreed that he deserves a tip as he did not even take anything off of our bill after we had to wait for the steak to be properly prepared. My son who does not make much money decided to give the waiter Steve $3 I know this is not much but it was a bank you just for the service and not the food. My son was offended when Steve returned the three dollars. My son asked Steve why he return the $3 Steve said that it was an insult to him. This was not an insult to him it was an insult to the restaurant. I will not come back to the restaurant nor will my son I give this restaurant a one star only because I cannot give it a zero. Thank you"}
{"text":"Lived in AZ for over a year.  Hands down best service I've had since I moved here.  Shanda at the bar was awesome! Can't go wrong with the ribs.  Come in small parties to avoid the wait.  I also love a place I can put peanut shells on the floor"}
{"text":"warm sweet rolls and a bucket of peanuts before you even sit down at the table.  long island ice teas in mugs, although not strong but yummy.  My Medium Rare Dallas fillet was savory and tender.    The chili side was ordinary.  Overall, I was content with my food and had half of it left for the next day.    The theme is kinda cheesey and they make the waitresses do some silly dance every hour, but hey all in good fun.  Beats having to go to the gym afterwards, since it looks like a good 10 minutes workout for them."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the food here.  My review is for a takeout order, so it is for the food only.  Delicious!!!  My friend brought me a combo plate with the ribs, pulled pork, chicken, potatoes, and veggies.  Probably the best ribs and pulled pork I've had in AZ. The rolls and cinnamon butter and amazing as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing every single time! Hot rolls amazing service. You will love this place!"}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse never ever disappoints! Everytime i come here whether i get the country fried steak or the catfish! Its always sooooo good! The portions of course are huge! It wouldn't be Texas if it wasn't...oh and the bread with the cinnamon butter!!!! AMAZING!!!! Why can't they be on the West Coast where i know live!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  I just wish we had more of them in Southern California.  I always get the prime rib, which is delicious, tender, and flavorful.  It's also very reasonably priced (at least compared to California prices).  The sides I have ordered are the baked potato (good but surprisingly small), salad (fresh with good toppings), french fries (very good), loaded mashed potatoes (also good), and green beans (these were awful, mushy and greasy!).  My husband and son really liked their baby back ribs, I thought they were a little dry.  Service was also great."}
{"text":"Ridiculous.  We have four people in our party.  One on her way about 15 minutes out and they won't seat us.   There's many more restaurants who will be more accommodating.  Last time for us.."}
{"text":"The service here is always decent, I've only had a problem here once but we ended up coming back anyway. The food is fresh, restaurant is big and clean. I'd definitely recommend going here!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience.  Our waitress was warm & attentive. She brought a new sweet tea, just as my glass hit the 1/2 mark.  My favorites, the potato skins, only cheese & bacon were Loaded!  Then, when she took my husband's plate, she noticed he didn't like the ribs he ordered, so she had her manager remove the price from our ticket!  WoW!  So, we put the amount back on her tip!  My favorite steak place around the Metro Center Circle!"}
{"text":"Went to location at estrella on Wed. Was quickly seated by young lady towards the back of the restraunt kept checking to see if we were following her. Was given rolls she pulled off the front counter that who knows how long they were sitting there while every customer walked by them. Left the rolls( cold by the way). Oh by the way this was my first time here. Hostess left pointing to th peanuts and menu. Thought we would start with appetizers to taste rather than a full menus item. Waitress came by and suggested  the fried pickles,  so we took her suggestion and ordered them along with a beer. Pickles  came in about 10 minutes, guess there in no hurry here. The taste was well let's just say mildly  sucked. Worse appetizer ever , very tasteless with waterred down dipping sauce. Never could pinpoint what the flavor of th sauce was. Terrible appetizer. Ordered more rolls hoping they would come hot. You know how. you crave hot rolls with butter on them. No dice didn't happen . Came lukewarm again. Terrible. Don't know why but ordered another app, killer ribs. Just tasted them and asked for a to go box. Didn't feel like eating them. So my first experience here totally sucked"}
{"text":"Just visited for the first time. Haven't eaten yet, but noticed the reserved parking for wounded combat veterans. Five stars just for that!"}
{"text":"Good spot.  The service could be faster and more attentive..  I shouldn't have to look for you when I want another beer."}
{"text":"This is a good, cheap steak. For about $11, you can get an 8 oz sirloin with two sides. There is an 8 oz sirloin and BBQ chicken breast combo for around $14 which is also very good. I always opt for the salad and baked potato. My friend had the pulled pork platter for $8 today and enjoyed it. They are not fancy steaks, but I don't really care for super fancy steaks. If I am in the mood for some high protein meals that won't really send me in the poorhouse, I will come here. I still may prefer Outback, but the service has always been friendly and usually by cute girls that I creep out with my creepy friends."}
{"text":"Decent (commercial/chain), affordable steak house. You don't have a Texas Roadhouse in LA, but you have some in Arizona.   The steaks here aren't bad at all. They do age their steaks a bit and rib eyes, prime ribs and other cuts range from $15 to $25. Great stuff for decent prices!   Our waitress was super cool. Attentive, nice and sweet. Make sure you have your birthday dinner here...surprise surprise!"}
{"text":"Sheldon! Your services were awesome tonight! I forgot what my margarita with the extra random shot was called, so I'll name it the Netflix and Chill margarita. Anyways that was amazeballs. My filet, amazeballs. Enjoyed good company from my amazing co workers, and we were even sang to. I love this place!  Sheldon deserves an immediate promotion. Unless he makes more in tips with less drama, then do what you do Sheldon.   Five stars because I've had tequila and my steak was insane and Sheldon was a total boss. I'll come back maybe. Phoenix is a happening spot!  Please mail me some bread and cinnamon butter. K thanks. #drunkyelping"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Ft Worth Ribeye with mushrooms & onions. It comes in 3 sizes, is mouthwatering and is well seasoned. Unfortunately my mixed vegetables were undercooked and the chilly was more salty than I care for.  I've had this ribeye 4 times at various Texas Roadhouses, and twice the meal was made to perfection.  This is a great meal at a great price.  BTW this is a noisy place like most of the popular restaurants."}
{"text":"They have excellent food and good service. It is usually really busy, but it is worth the wait.  The food is always cooked perfectly and tastes amazing. I highly recommend Texas Roadhouse. I usually end up going there once a month. I've tried a lot of different things on their menu and I really enjoyed all of them. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"We came to Texas Roadhouse for Mother's Day dinner and will not be back.  We called ahead and got a pager # for our party of 5 and were told 30 min wait.  There were 4 of us waiting and a 5th on their way so we were going to need an odd sized regardless.  Our 5th ended up getting stuck in traffic when our # was called.  Here is what transpired at the hostess stand:  Hostess: Great, is all your party here? Me: Yes the 4 of us are here and our 5th is stuck in traffic Hostess: Well I need all of your party here to seat you. Me: I understand, there are 4 of our 5 and the other almost here. Hostess: We can't seat you until your entire party is here. Me: I understand, she is moments away and it is one person in a part of five, not like we are holding a table and waiting for several people. Hostess: We don't seat incomplete parties. Me: I understand that. Hostess: We have a sign. (points to sign that says 'we don't seat incomplete parties') Me:  Yes I see the sign Hostess: we have two signs. (points to another sign that says 'we don't seat incomplete parties') Me: ....... Hostess: (gestures to both signs again) Me: so are being penalized because our friend is stuck in traffic? Hostess: I already told you, we don't seat incomplete parties.  So now we are back to waiting and our friend ended up not coming so we wouldn't have to wait another 20 min to be seat.  Thanks for helping us make wonderful family memories, Texas Road House!  Happy Mother's Day!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly last night was my first visit to the old roadhouse.  I drive past it almost daily and there always seems to be a packed parking lot so I was always wondering about the hype surrounding this place.  I was told you get served a bucket of peanuts and that the environment was laid back, casual and fun.  The peanuts were true and the environment was indeed casual and laid back.  However, the food was just sub par in my opinion.  I mean they are a steakhouse but yet they offer mostly bar food so I don't think they did either exceptionally well.  You could apparently pick your steak from the display case by the entrance if you wanted but even that didn't cut it for me.    Oddly enough I chose to go with the Shrimp platter.  It was grilled shrimp on skewers that came with a lemon/butter dipping sauce.  It also came with three sides so I was stoked!  I chose the cup of chili, the sweet potato and the fresh veggies.  Shrimp:  Came out cold and was not grilled--it was pan seared and fishy.  The lemon/butter dipping sauce smelled and tasted like puke.  Cup of Chili:  Wendy's has a better chili.  This looked and tasted like the kind of chili you open from a can and put on your hotdog.  It was not good, not fresh and not hearty at all.  Side of Veggies:  It was just broccoli stuffed into a little cup with a few carrots mixed in.  The broccoli wasn't seasoned and it was cold, not cooked through and gross.  Sweet Potato:  Pretty hard to mess this up and it was quite good.  It was a baked sweet potato and it came with a side of cinammon, marshmallow gooey goodness.  It was good.   The buns that were served prior to dinner were a bleek attempt to replicate what O'Charley's used to offer.  They were basically frozen pieces of bread, thawed and drizzed with honey.  Some may say they were good but I was not interested.  Others at my table ordered chicken fried steak, salads, steaks, burgers, etc.  Some things looked okay others didn't seem edible.  The portions were huge and everything just seemed to be stewing in lard.  Bleh.  Another annoying part of this meal was that 4 times throughout the night one of the waitresses screamed at the top of their lungs to announce a birthday.  It was super annoying and continuously interrupted our meal.  I guess this is the place for that type of drama but I wasn't prepared for it and I didn't enjoy it.    I wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"YUM!   Love this place.. have always had a delicious meal and great atmosphere!!!! Always look forward to returning."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill. It's kind of like they don't care anymore. It's getting really hard to find a decent steakhouse that actually knows how to cook a steak right. Ask for medium and it either comes out Well or Rare.   I am here with my wife. The waitress is ok. Really not engaged. I ordered an 11oz sirloin Medium-Rare and it's has a sliver of medium on top where it has the grill marks but it's rare from the middle down where there are absolutely no grill marks to be seen.   They no longer wait for you to cut into your steak to see if it's to your liking. Drop and run. Well, I guess it's a done for us coming to this establishment. :(  P.S. I guess our waitress Desiree wants us out. She dropped the check off. No asking if we want dessert, no saying I'll be your cashier when you are ready, no take your time. Just another drop and run.  The place is busy, but they have a lot of staff and it's always busy. Oh well."}
{"text":"As you seen before my reviews Texas roadhouse is always consistent and is always so good if you never had Texas roadhouse you need to."}
{"text":"Well what can I say every time I eat here it's amazing I love this place this has to be my favorite steakhouse the taste and consistency is outstanding."}
{"text":"We came in at 4:15 right when they opened. Got immediately seated our server Abigail? Or Audrey? Tossed the napkin roll ups on our plate.  Asked if we wanted bread we said yes then took our drink order. Cause you know free bread. Yum. Asked if we wanted any starters we ordered the Fried Pickles. Waited around 10 minutes for the pickles. When they came out she said. Do you still want bread. We already said yes. So we said Yes please. Got our bread and took our order. My mother got there Burger, my grandma got the 9.99 special with the 8oz steak, and i Got the 9.99 texas combo with the 8oz and the shrimp. For the sides i got the salad and the steak fries. My grandma got the baked potato and the side of chili I got my salad before the food came out. It was pretty dry and the croutons were burnt. The rest of the food came out and the server forgot the side of chili. So we asked for her to get it. By the time she brought it out we were already half way done. As we are STILL USING OUR FORK and knifes. She said \"Do you guys want boxes\" we said no thanks, as we are still eating. We take a break as were talking. She comes up and grabs my grandmas plate. She looks at us and says Are you done? We said yes since she basically grabbed everything set up to be taken away. This is 30minutes into our meal. She came back with the check and didnt even offer if we wanted anything else. Didn't ask for refills once. We still tipped 20% and left without causing issues. As were leaving my Grandma tells us that her food was cold. If we would have known that inside we would have complained.  Hopefully Abigail or whatever is having a better day now."}
{"text":"First off CHRISTIN is 100% amazing! I can not say enough wonderful things about Christin's one of a kind service! Every time we go she makes our night out unique and creates lasting memories for me and my family! Thank you Christin for making my boyfriend's 30th birthday a smash. She took such awesome care of us I don't know how to thank her enough. Her service was timely and flawless! Christin is such a treasure to the Texas Roadhouse crew the GIRL needs a raise, promotion, and some serious recognition from the top dogs. Her energy is fantastic, and you can tell she has a real passion for her job! She kept us happy, hydrated, and entertained the whole time. She even invited us to dance along with the servers and taught us all the right moves so we did not look to ridiculous. She also has a very fun and classy way of totally embarrassing you on your birthday when she brings her crew and the birthday saddle out. Christin is defiantly a gem! Food was wonderful as always but it is always nice to get excellent Service  too! I had the sirloin with a Cesar salad and loaded potatoes, wail my boyfriend had the catfish with rice and corn, his brother had the chili and mom ate the California chicken with a loaded sweet potato! Let's just say all of us happily cleaned our plates! Delicious and so yummy! Beer was ice cold and refreshing! Hostess were also very friendly. All around must go to place! What's better then delicious food, outstanding service, fun atmosphere, great drinks, loud music, and good times! Again shout out to Christin keep up the impeccable service!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Walking into this place, I felt like I really am walking into a steakhouse in Texas! Large families, all wood sticky (from beer?) floors, loud country music...this place was packed! Though I don't care for the atmosphere, we loved the food! It's true what they say, everything IS bigger in Texas! We shared an awesome blossom (fried onion),  a bone in ribeye medium rare to share, which came with a side of baked potato and chili. Mmmmm so good! Needless to say we had many leftovers and made a delicious steak and eggs breakfast the next morning :)  OMG did I mention the biscuits? I was trying to keep my hands off them to save space for the meat but it was so hard! The cinnamon butter they give you with the bread is irresistible. Definitely going back again for the steaks."}
{"text":"This texas roadhouse is one of the best I've been to staff is amazing! Food is delicious almost as if grandma made it!! Of course the resturaunt is very noisey but thats what they're known for and the line dancing is awesome!!! Oh and dont get me started on management, they seem great! Always on the floor not only interacting with staff but many tables too! Keep up the good work!!!!"}
{"text":"Wait-staff is top notch; I have been to other Texas Roadhouse locations but the waitress set this one apart. I was not looking for anything too heavy for lunch; only chose this place due to my friend's birthday wishes, so I was perplexed on what to have. I decided on a salad but wasn't sure, and then the waitress referred me to \"The Steakhouse Filet\" Salad which I had not given much consideration. I took her recommendation and I ended up trying to devour the plate the salad was soo good. The waitress not only knew her food, but she also knew how to wait on us properly; she was there when needed and wasn't too \"buggy\". I hate to say that I forgot her name but I did, and now I feel guilty for doing so. That being said, the service was wonderful. The only negative to this place was the speed. I walked in at 1o'clock expecting to be back at work by 2:30ish; we didn't even leave our booth till 3 because the food took a little bit long in the kitchen.  The service and the food was soo good though that I wasn't willing to let a thing like cook time spoil a great lunch, I will just plan accordingly for the next time I go; and this place will definitely get a next time!!"}
{"text":"This location is a JOKE. The last two times I ordered to-go I asked for my steak medium and when I got home it was completely rare and I had to throw it on the grill myself. This time when I ordered to-go I asked for medium once again and politely asked for them to make sure it was actually medium instead of rare. I get home and my steak is well-done to the point where it's not edible. I tried to call the restaurant and talk to a manager, I am on hold for over 10 minutes and no one comes back on the phone. So on top of not being able to eat my dinner, I spent money on nothing. I will NEVER come back to this location."}
{"text":"In late March my dad and I went to spring training and we stayed at a nice hotel nearby. We passed by the place on Sunday evening on our way to the hotel and it looked different than something we'd find in San Diego. Later that night we go and sit at the bar. The bartender greeted us right away and offered us drinks right on the spot. No wait at all. The cool part about the place is it's informal. Customers can eat peanuts and just drop them on the floor. Even the workers were wearing sports wear. That's how cool it was.   The food was quickly served and delicious. We spent under $25 both times visiting in the 4 days being there. Next spring training were definitely going back."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is always great. They have a great food selection and their rolls are delicious! This location in particular seems to have a longer wait than others, but for the most part, all Texas Roadhouse's seem to be equivalent--this one included."}
{"text":"I typically don't eat steak, but it's so good here that I get it every time.  I always get chili as a side and it's flavorful.  Obviously, the rolls are to die for as well.  This location has the best service of all the ones I've been to."}
{"text":"We where seated in a area that had not had a server yet and we waited for about 15 minutes until i kindly ask a server named Kim if she could take our order.  She was very apologetic & I assured her that it was alright and no need to worry. Me and my wife were very happy with her service, she was prompt and fast and caring. I will return in the future because of amazing service she gave us. The 8oz sirloin  is kickass!"}
{"text":"We usually have good experiences at Texas Roadhouse. However, tonight was just not the case. I ordered salmon, like usual, and it was only warm. As I was eating it, the middle was undercooked. I sent it back and it came back dry and the bottom was burnt. The staff was friendly and accommodated our requests. I would normally recommend this place. But, I guess like every other place could have, this was just one bad night."}
{"text":"Megan The Manager Beyond Sweet Friendly and Awesome Her Presence Made The Visit All The Better My Sever Was Awesome Too"}
{"text":"Had the Bone in rib eye steak. Ordered it Medium as always. The steak had good texture and good char marks. The steaks taste was pretty good as the cook did a decent job balancing the beef and marbling to speak out along with the seasonings of salt and pepper. As always the bread and butter were off the hook!! Server Alicia was great and very attentive to our needs through out the meal.  I have to say this was a much better experience than I have had I the past. Could be because of the time and day or it could be just a good night for the folks work'n."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great service! They dance to country songs every now and then! Servers are super nice!"}
{"text":"Would give it more stars but service wasnt very good.  He was nice but took forever to get eating utensils,  the ketchup bottle was empty and had to ask 2 different people, I asked server for butter which he never brought.  Food was good, had the Salmon and hubby had a steak that was cooked perfect, he likes it \"blue\".  There were 5 of us and had a good time but its very hard to have conversations because its so loud."}
{"text":"Never got to a point I wanted to order food. Stopped in for a beer and appetizers but the smell walking in almost knocked me down. Pretty much the heavy aroma of spilled, stale beer from the door past the bar area.  I swear when I was here last year it was the same smell.   Nice, attentive bartender was the only bright spot."}
{"text":"I normally expect high quality service from Texas Roadhouse, but when I went last they outshines themselves from my already high expectations. We were short on time and they did an excellent job at accommodating our call ahead to be added to the wait list. We arrived and were seated quickly at a booth per our request over a table. The waitress was wonderful in taking our order, and when the food came out only 12 minutes later she asked if I would like to cut my steak to confirm the amount it was cooked. I was pleased, and honestly it was the best medium rare steak I had ever eaten. She was wonderful at bringing out more rolls as we desired. On our way out another server had overheard us talking to each other about how we forgot to ask for some rolls to go and he volunteered to bring us more before we left. Also during the middle of our meal the manager came over and personally asked us if everything was going well. The food is amazing, the service is outstanding, and it's very reasonably priced. I highly recommend Texas Roadhouse for any occasion, and especially recommend going to this location. I believe Josh was the name of the manager. Excellent dining experience!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here for awhile with the family but I really like it here. Love that they dance and have this nice western feel to the place. I have always loved their food, they won't disappoint you. The service is very nice, everyone interacts with the customers which always makes us feel more welcome and make the experience more enjoyable. Great place to go to for barbecue."}
{"text":"Second time at a Texas Roadhouse, came back after a great first experience! This time was just as good. They give you peanuts while you wait, which explains the shell-covered floors throughout the place. Go for the steak and stay for the line dancing wait staff!"}
{"text":"This place is Great they know how to cook a steak here . And you get a nice cut of meat too. The service has always been fantastic too. So if you want some good food with excellent service come here also if you download the app you can put yourself on a wait list that will cut down on your wait time as you drive there ."}
{"text":"Complained on website because this was inconsistent considering previous  dining. I appreciate a manager reaching out to me. Explained it was most likely an issue of over seasoning on the \"line.\""}
{"text":"It's OK, but a lot of places do \"OK\" steak these days.  Even Bob Evans has gotten into the game with a $9.99 steak topped with shrooms and cheese that isn't ALL THAT BAD.  So besides a decent steak, what do I expect of a place called Texas Roadhouse?    Well, I expect sides cooked Texas style - lots of flavorings: cinnamon butter for the potatoes, black peppered corn, ham in the green beans. Where did they misfire on the food?  NaCl.  Say it with me: salty salt salt saltiness.  My wife's burger was pucker-up salty.  The green beans were warm wet salt sticks.  I drank two tall glasses of water just to prevent my brain from shriveling like a salted slug.  What else do I expect?  A lively fun atmosphere.  Our waitress was awesome (thanks Shannon!).  But oh the mid-meal pain we endured with the super lame line dancing bit.  The girls doing the line dance didn't want to be, which means it was a total fail.  Let me paint the picture: The loud music comes on blaring, so all conversation at your table is forced to stop.  Because it's so loud, you can't simply ignore the line dance coming up and carry on as you were.  \"If I was here on a fun date, this could work\" you say to yourself as you watch your kids cover their ears and close their eyes.  But what happens next?  All the female employees under 25 or so line up and: A. look confused, B. look embarassed, C. show no coordination.  Torture for them and torture for the patrons.  The cherry on top of this hilarious sideshow: they are all wearing t-shirts that loudly proclaim \"I LOVE MY JOB\"!!!  LOL  Yea you do, and it REALLY shows!  To be fair to those girls, it doesn't look like management spent any time training them.  Either let them do a fun routine they enjoy and give them some paid time (on the clock) to practice, or scrap the whole thing.  Please.  Oh, and somebody hide the salt shaker from the cooks."}
{"text":"We had an interesting experience coming here when walking to the building we saw some vomit near the front entrance.  A man outside smoking said, \"oh sorry, that was me.\"   Strange that he would advertise that, especially since I almost stepped on it.  Anyways, the food was decent, but I don't like their onion ring thing as much as the Outback's.  Service was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Ok... I know this is a chain, and generally I'm not a huge fan of chains, but this place is pretty good. First, I like that you can call ahead before you go, it saved us like an hour of sitting around waiting at the restaurant. That was great! I got a strawberry margarita, which costs 7$ and it was HUGE! Also, it was tasty...nothing wrong with that. The food here is also good and the portion sizes are insane. I got the ribs (13$) and had WAY too much food....a caesar salad (which was very tasty), a sweet potato, rolls with cinnamon butter, and a ton of fall off the bone ribs....everything was good. The BF had a steak with corn and a baked potato. Also fairly tasty (but not even close to my ribs...sorry BF). I would definitely come back here because it is super inexpensive for what you get and the food is good."}
{"text":"A welcome surprise.   I didn't expect much.  I pulled up and the parking lot was over flowing on a Wednesday night, so I thought I would give it a try.  I sat at the bar and the service was delightful.  Both an experienced and new bartender, so it was a fun easy going environment and very attentive  Everything I had was so good.  Again, i didn't expect much and you have to remember it is a chain.  But my house salad was the best I've had in a long time with the most delicious homemade croutons.  I followed it up with a filet and a sweet potato that was to die for.  All I can say is TRY IT.  I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Our food was delicious and the Staff was amazing and the manager was very friendly as well!! Def. recommend this restaurant for anyone who wants a good steak and good treatment! :)"}
{"text":"We went here awhile ago for my graduation party, steak was dead cold when served and we waited almost an hour for it. I guess they kind of forgot about us and left it there all that time. It's too bad, because this restaurant used to be spectacular, but now it's turned into garbage."}
{"text":"We were served raw steak and our waitresses solution, her name was Chelsea, was to microwave it to cook it further. This is not acceptable. She also threw my sunglasses under the table when she cleaned up, because we complained about their disgusting, raw food. I would not recommend this place to anyone and will never be returning."}
{"text":"I am back!  The results are even better than last time.  Our server, Pat, was spot on in every aspect of customer service.  He took our order quickly, correctly,with a smile and a very positive attitude!  He also had a fun and warming laugh which was contagious.  My wife and I had just come from a very serious hospital visit but he warmed our hearts with the precision of an experienced surgeon!  All our food was excellent just like our last visit.  My wife's steak was done perfectly as were my ribs.  Then I attacked the salmon which had been temping me with its wonderful herbal vapor and Wow!  It was so rewarding to taste all that I had been inhaling.  If you love dinner rolls then you'll love theirs.  They are warm, soft and so yummy!  Will I have to stop now because writing this has made me hungry again so I am going to go finish off my left overs!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while. The last past few times we have come here it's been terrible! Bad service bad food and dumb as dumb manager. Will not be going back ever!!!!! Sad because we really loved coming here."}
{"text":"This place is another Logans. It's a family restaurant with zero atmosphere and about an inauthentic as a 'Roadhouse' can be. The staff are highschoolers who are polite one on one but passing a cluster of wait staff makes you feel like you are an extra in a teen flick.   So why give it 4 stars? The steak. I had an 11 ounce sirloin medium rare and while it wasn't Flemmings it was better than Logans, Outback and almost as good as The Keg for a third of the price. It was cooked PERFECTLY, thick, juicy and flavorful.  The side of green beens left a lot to be desired and the fries were just OK but I will be back for that steak for sure."}
{"text":"Good food and Great atmosphere, and friendly waitresses. My family and the staff at the restaurant came and sang happy Birthday to me!"}
{"text":"I went with 5 friends. They sat 4 of us at one table, they sat Cameron and I at a different table. The group of 6 that came before us were sat together, and so was the group of 6 that came after us, and I saw many tables that could have sat the entire group. Since I couldn't hear what the other 4 were saying, I don't know how their meal was, but Cameron told me his steak was dry. My ribs and bread were good, but my mushrooms were under cooked and tough. Our waitress never bought me a drink refill, so my cup was empty most of the night. I had to bum a alcohol wipe off the main table because Cameron and I didn't get any. Also the men's bathroom was filthy. I still left a small tip between rounding my check up and some cash, but it was less than my normal tip. I ended up getting my check and leaving early since I was having such a horrible experience at the Texas Roadhouse at 7801 Gateway Lane in Concord, NC."}
{"text":"Came here with one of my girlfriends to catch up and feed our craving for some barbecue. Authentic? Not really- your typical chain BBQ type food. No special marinade or extra smokey burnt ends you'd find in a real finger lickin BBQ joint but it does what it needs to. It's great for a group to get together enjoy beers and have some ribs."}
{"text":"They are the best!!! My husband took me for my birthday. It was my first time in NC. We waited a little,picked out our steaks and the waitress offered free sides we never had. The steak was cooked and flavored perfectly.  The manager was really nice and gave us a bag of their peanuts(I gave to my brother) and a membership card to sign everytime we come. I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are huge TR enthusiasts. But my experience last week was a little different. We often order our food to go through the app but I had mistakenly sent my order to another location. Upon arriving and trying to pay, the manager at this location and I realized my mistake. I had my four month old in my arms and had no idea what could be done. Without hesitation the manager put in my order, called the other location to let them know I wouldn't be picking up there and got my payment voided for me. She made me feel like it was truly not a big deal even though I could tell she was going out of her way to correct my mistake.  The staff here has always been friendly and given great customer service but this particular experience really stood out and it's no wonder the staff is so awesome under such great leadership. I only wish I would have gotten her name."}
{"text":"Very good food and atmosphere, the warm bread and peanuts were good starters!  I had the appetizer ribs my side choice was a sweet potato  which was cooked perfect!  I'm picky about my barbecue sauce so I ordered it on the side. The meat fell off the bone and was tender and I didn't even need the sauce because the seasoning of the ribs was very good! The only complaint that I have is the side salad is very white and bland! A salad should have a variety of dark green lettuce not iceberg lettuce which has no taste. So thumbs down to their side salad! Overall they are known for their meats and that was delicious!"}
{"text":"Yummy as always!!! I love the early dinner special for 9.99, it's a perfect amount! The service is awesome. Expect a crowd, but if you are a party of 4 or less you get seated pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Friday after \"Snowmaggedon 2014,\" which happens to be Valentine's Day, we opted for a dinner that's easy on the budget and low on the romance factor. As expected there was a crowd by the front waiting for their tables, it's a dinner nightmare trifactor (a Friday night after 3 days of snow prison AND a special occassion for some). I didn't really care since I was highly occupied by the barrel of peanuts sitting right by the doors. As I was throwing peanut shells on the ground (sidenote: I always feel guilty doing that... I mean, they are such messes and someone has to clean that up at some point), I asked about the bar. Since I wasn't there to stare into my lover's eyes (ya, definitely no), I would be happy just to sit down anywhere. And lo and behold, 2 empty bar stools at the end!   The 3 ladies working behind the bar were just friendly enough and efficient. Since all 3 of them were available to serve, we didn't have to wait long to get drinks or food. The most impressive part was when one of them found out we haven't been to the eatery before, she brought out 4 little samplers of side items for us to taste. That was very thoughtful. All the sides were good but the mashed tater was the best. The chili was solid and filling. Green beans aren't for the vegeterian/vegan folks as they were immersed in bacon goodness. The corn was... just corn. Oh ya, the soft rolls with cinnamon brown sugar butter.   I started with the house frozen margarita with an extra shot of tequila for $8, which isn't bad for the amount of drink I got. Brain freeze anyone?!  I also ordered a 10 oz ribeye, which was cooked to perfect medium rare with just enough seasoning. I ended up with the baked sweet potato which made good leftover to go. Filet was solid as well. The food is no thrill but good. What we spent on a meal for two would barely pay for a steak for one at a fancy place, which normally is my biggest beef (steakhouse... beef... got it?!) about eating steaks when out. If I can get a solid slab of meat for $10, it's hard to justify 3-4 times of markup. The menu prices are very reasonable here, I can see why it's popular with families.  Overall excellent visit. I even got a small das boot (hmm... das cowboy boots, a cross between Texas and Germany) for $5, and that was my romantic V-Day gift to cap off the ultra non romantic night out."}
{"text":"Just OK. The service sucked. We waited forever for bread rolls and after asked our waitress twice we flagged down another waiter and he brought us some. Food felt just run of the mill and nothing really special. Actually left disappointed in what was supposed to be a fun birthday dinner. Won't be back anytime soon rather spend my $ on food that someone cared about cooking."}
{"text":"Tried to use my worthless gift cards and their system won't let you use them online Stay away purchasing them unless you go in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Came on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was pretty busy, but we were still offered excellent service by Jennifer. Food was also very good at even better prices. We will be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"Overall I go here very frequently and have no complaints so far. The customer service has been good if not better than that which is a big plus. Can't complain about the food because anyone that goes here knows how good it is and if you haven't been here I definitely recommend it and you should double up on your roll and their signature butter that comes with it!"}
{"text":"Came here on a late night. And my experience was excellent. It was clearly after a rush. But my service was fantastic. My server was Gage and he was charismatic, funny and friendly the entire night. The food was fantastic picked my own steak and it came out perfect. Over all it was a great experience and it will keep me coming back. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Food was good but they overcooked my steak and got my order slightly wrong. Waiter was really attentive though. I will never give this place over 3 stars until they stop screaming in everyone's faces at the top of their lungs when it is people's birthday. Holy Geez it is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Every time we eat there we have great food and service. I really enjoy their tbone and my husband likes the filet. Always cooked perfect. I like the call ahead seating as well."}
{"text":"Up till now, we have been satisfied with this location of Texas Road House.  Had I reviewed it for earlier visits it would normally be between a 3 and a 4.   But, on our last visit a week ago, something completely unheard of happened and as a result I will never go back. I have been going to this location about once a month for over a year.  I go here to meet with two friends of mine and we enjoy the time catching up with eachother.  We went there on a Sunday this time and the place was not busy.  Half the tables or more were empty.  Because we only see eachother once a month we do spend a lot of time talking.  We normally spend several hours there.  This time was a little longer because we decided to have desert. Service had been okay and we had paid the dinner bill, prior to ordering desert.  We had all left (what we believed was) a good tip.  When we had finished desert we were about to pay that bill and again leave a good tip for our server.  At this point we were very surprised when our server came over with the bill and sat down next to us.  She proceeded to give us a lecture about how she only had 3 tables this day and thanks to our staying so long she had not made nearly as much as she should have.  She also blames us for taking her largest table ((which we had not requested, we were just seated there).  She suggested that in the future we should go to Village Inn.  We told her that we would not bother her in the future, however she wouldn't stop going on about it.  Soon it was apparent that she was waiting for us to give her more money.  This was not going to and did not happen.  One of my friends stayed behind to talk to the manager.  She told me later that the manager said our server had the right to express herself.  The manager also told her \"You can leave now\"."}
{"text":"The only quick service Texas Roadhouse offers is their hand dryers. If you're expecting your family of 4 to be served fast and you all order steak (which is why most people go to this steak house) you will be disappointed. Great food is not served In a matter of a couple of minutes. That is what they serve here.. Great food. Waiters are just as friendly as any other restaurant. If you believe waiting for quality food is worth it then I'd recommend you come here. Manager is also very nice I didn't catch the name. Also I was one of the last people to show up 30 minutes right before they closed on a Sunday night which could've been a reason for the longer wait. Overall good experience definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Tonight I went to dinner for my birthday with my family and the experience was extremely disappointing and frustrating. Our server was not attentive at all. We ordered an appetizer and got it after two families who sat down after us got theirs(which were the same appetizers so it makes no sense). We got our salads and two of them were missing dressing and weren't how we ordered them. We got our appetizer right before the entrees and it was not hot or even warm. Ordered bar drinks and it took half the time we were there to receive them. Our steaks were medium well/well for the ones we ordered medium rare and rare for the ones we ordered medium well. Sent them back and came back the same exact way. We didn't get the mushrooms and onions we ordered. They forgot about my birthday which is sad considering I chose the place and brought my whole family. We told a manager as well as our server and they still neglected to acknowledge my birthday. Won't be back for awhile. :("}
{"text":"Love this place, however very disappointed with tonight.  After eating our meal we noticed signs around  for the Valentines special.   We asked our waitress Taylor what the special was and she replied that since it wasn't actually Valentines Day....(yet the special runs from the 10-14th) you have to ask for it.  Well I'm sorry there is nothing on the tables advertising it.  And we were sitting at a table without a light over it the advertisements are over the booths.  VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to the prime rib,but its only served on weekends.  Had to get another cut of steak instead.  The overall quality was OK for a chain.  The two sides were tasty.  They ran out of the Rolls and Cinnamon Butter or couldn't make it for some unknown reason.  Therefore was never served any :(.  Kinda bad service since server stop refilling water as soon as you pay your bill.    Recommendation:  Prepare to wait since this is usually busy."}
{"text":"VETERAN'S DAY 2012 - I heard from a friend that the restaurant was offering a special for Veteran's Day, so I decided to take my family in, and celebrate my daughter's 10th birthday in conjunction with the holiday... we went out of our way to go here, in light of the myriad of restaurant specials available from other establishments on the holiday.... We arrived at 6:00PM (despite the holiday, I had to work all day). Prior to being seated I inquired about the Veteran's Day specials and I was bluntly told, by a person in authority, that the restaurant was 'NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF GIVING FREE MEALS AWAY.' ... and that their Veteran's Day specials had ended at 4:00PM... I was also told that the restaurant had gone out of their way to open early for the holiday, which implied that as an Armed Forces Veteran, I was an imposition... the supervisor offered me a 10% discount as a baseless, contrary aside... I never got any discount, by the way.  I was quite frank in expressing my position that I did not expect a 'free meal',' nor did I appreciate the condescending tone of the remark . To be clear: I did not ask for a free meal; I inquired about the specials that they had promoted to honor my military service, and I was promptly rebuked.   To the serving staff's credit, they recognized my daughter's birthday in a thoughtful and appropriate fashion. The food was good, and consistent with countless previous visits.  I am a longtime fan of the chain, but in light of this experience, I am inclined to more carefully consider my dining-out choices.   Based on the representation of the supervisor I spoke with, I am firmly of the opinion that the 'Veteran's Day'  promotion they offered was a shallow, indifferent, and insincere ploy to get business on the holiday, and not an earnest offering in appreciation of my, or any other Veteran's, sacrifices on this occasion.  I am a Veteran. I don't need a free meal, or a discount: a simple 'Thanks' will do."}
{"text":"Normally five stars, but today was 2 stars. I ordered my usual 6 Oz with cup of chili and salad. Chili and salad were good as always, but my steak, which was ordered medium came up rare. More importantly, it was probably an end cut that never should have been served in the first place. I was able to choke down about 2 ounces worth, but the rest was too tough to chew without choking on it. Again, normally the sirloin in excellently prepared. I was in a hurry at the end of my lunch break. The waitress offered to have a new one cooked but I didn't have that kind if time $15 after tip is a bit much for 2 ounces of sirloin, side salad, and chili. Hopefully my next visit is up to normal standards."}
{"text":"This place was amazing so glade my homegirl chose here I'm not  fan of meat and/or steak but i taste my friends and hers was amazing. The salmon was perfect and the shrimp was very flavorful.  Me and my homeboy tried the margerita and forzon was the way to go. I had an amazing time the ambience was awesome and our server was great I'll definitely be back for more salmon and drinks!"}
{"text":"This review is based off the NEW GOODYEAR LOCATION (Pebble Creek and McDowell) They have only been open couple weeks new so no yelp page is made for them yet I guess. But my family and I ate there last night 12/2/13 for my fiancés birthday and my dad got food Poisoning for the roasted chicken. He was violently sick all last night and into today. He ended going to the doctor and The doctor did confirm food poisoning. We did check the left over chicken in the refrigerator we had brought home and the chicken was very red. Make sure the Chicken is cooked!!! Will never order chicken here!! And probably will not be a top choice of restaurants to eat at in my neighborhood. Again this is for the GOODYEAR LOCATION."}
{"text":"Today I stopped by the Texas Roadhouse for dinner.  There were a lot of people waiting for seating so I was concerned I'd be waiting awhile for a table. I was pleasantly surprised that they were able able to seat me relatively quickly (within 15 minutes). I was immediately given the their rolls which were quite tasty and smooth. I proceeded to order a combo appetizer, followed by a country fried steak and wrapped up the visit with a cake for dessert. I would recommend this place for people who are really hungry and don't want to break the bank."}
{"text":"Welcome Ladies and Gentlemen to Concord's only \"Texas Road Kill Cafe\" and that is being nice. Was in town on business as always and we decided to have a few drinks and dinner at what we thought was a restaurant called Texas Road House.  Our waitress was a sweetheart and on top of her game, yes she needs to upgrade. In our group, 4 people we sat down ordered a drink and a couple app's. 2 of the 4 of us had to request new silverware. Nothing like unwrapping a napkin and finding what looks to be dried poo all over the knife and fork of what is supposed to be clean silverware.  Next was resting your arms on a sticky table that had a funny smell of moldy wet towel.  We ordered a few burgers around the table. I gather they must of thought I was part deer.  Why you ask? Well never had a salt lick described as a hamburger. Ohh yummy. After I was revived from my slight stroke my associate was enjoying his food too. Yes, another salt lick that could double as a hockey puck. Not to worry though the app's were great. Chicken strips so dry they could be used as a , as a, as a, ok they were just that dry so a dust substitute maybe?  Once I washed everything down with a flat tap beer, but at least it wasn't skunky all was good.  Spent the rest of the evening chewing Tums and listening to the concert in my belly going on all night long.  Once was enough for this place!!!  Sorry"}
{"text":"The best rolls ever.. our waiter, I believe his name was Travis was great and very attentive. Our meals were deliver in a timely manner. My steak was perfect and everyone enjoyed theirs. Someone mentioned it was my birthday and everyone sang happy birthday tome, embarrassing."}
{"text":"After receiving a gift card, I was excited to return to Texas Roadhouse for lunch with my family.  The atmosphere was great, it was not overly crowed, although we arrived after 1 pm for lunch. My dish was grilled shrimp over seasoned rice with a sweet potato (my favorite!) and fresh mixed veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots).  I was not disappointed!  This is a restaurant where I know that the food I order is going to make me feel umm, umm, good!"}
{"text":"I've been here a half dozen or so times since it opened and it is always a great experience! The staff is very friendly and provide stellar service . The steaks and sides are just amazing . I love this place. I try to eat here a few times a month. We always enjoy the fun atmosphere. The prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Was visiting from out of the area.  Was definitely in the mood for some good BBQ and the Texas Roadhouse didn't disappoint.  Food was great.  Drinks were really good.  Our server was Cameron and he was awesome!  Best of all worlds and we plan on coming back next year during Spring Training!"}
{"text":"Medium does not mean burnt on the outside and bloody on the inside. I understand the concept of family restaurants, but at least 12 screaming kids, the steak was cold, burnt on the outside and cold and raw on the inside. I don't know how but it was. Deplorable. I won't return."}
{"text":"A family favorite for years. We used to go to the Alliance location when we lived down that way. We come to this location now as it is closer. The other will always be our favorite though.  Love the peanut barrels in the waiting area. And could they make you drool any more by laying those fabulous cuts of meant in your face. Then, watching them sizzle as they cook for all to see. Sheer torture of the super tasty kind.  The inside is large with lots of seating, mainly booths. Lighting is on the dim side but still enough to see comfortably. The menu is average length for a steakhouse. The menus stay on the table and are ready to go as soon as you sit down. You also get a small bucket of peanuts for the table while you are waiting on your meal.  Love the country theme. The staff wear tshirts and jeans. They are fun, friendly and aim to please.   We had the Cactus Blossom appetizer. There were 4 adults and we still had some left. And oh my, the yummy rolls with the cinnamon butter. This could have been a meal in itself! All 4 of us had the Ft. Worth Ribeye with side salads. Three of us had baked potatoes with butter and sour cream. My son had mashed potatoes and gravy.  The salads were well sized with tomatoes, cheddar cheese, egg and mixed greens. The veggies were brightly colored and fresh. Great start! The steaks were all cooked to perfection and seasoned well. Three medium and 1 medium rare. The potatoes were overflowing with butter and sour cream; no need to ask for extra.   The only downside, it can be quite busy at times, can be very loud as everything is wood and the sound bounces and they do not open until 3 during the week. These reasons are why I did give it a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I always enjoy the food when I come to Texas Rd house. The service is usually hit or miss. Last nights experience was pretty good. For some reason they always serve the onions under cooked. My mother and I both got ours well done but my sister made the mistake of assuming they would be grilled correctly. Instead they came hard with that strong raw white onion flavor. She decided not to complain and just got a box togo for everything else. The rolls and butter are always to die for and the Caesar dressing it always on point. I don't want to detour people from going because overall I love this place."}
{"text":"Many people told me to go to Texas Roadhouse many times...I was highly disappointed. Our steaks looked old and weren't cooked to the right temperature...which is crazy because you're paying so much money!!! The only good thing was our server Heather. She was wonderful. Super accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu. I could tell her managers were giving her a hard time and it was upsetting. I will never give anymore of my money to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The wait was an hour but that was expected during the dinner rush when we went. The staff is friendly and service good. We've been to this location once before and had poor quality food (over cooked meals) but we decided to try this location again as we had a much better experience at a different location. Again had poor quality food my requested medium cooked sirloin  was fatty and over well done and my husband's requested medium filet was chewy and more than well done as well. This location needs a new head chef or updated training on how to cook a steak properly. Will not end up back at this location."}
{"text":"The trashcan by the front entrance was overflowing and spilling out. The bathrooms were disgusting. Other than that the food and service was good!"}
{"text":"First time here, sense roadhouse closed at chapel hill.... Food and service was good. Not what I was used to from the other location but the food was still tasty! Waiter staff was very pleasant as well!"}
{"text":"OMG They messed my filet mignon twice  On two different occasion The food their even is over cooked  Or  Plain raw We still going their cause it waste time"}
{"text":"We went there for my birthday.  We were greeted OK, as it was busy we waited about 10 minutes,  no problem there.  I ordered a 12 oz ribey rare.  Meals took about another 15 minutes.  My ribeye was cooked correctly, however it was very tough, full of gristle.  Flavor was good,  I wonder the grade of steaks they serve."}
{"text":"Tonight my son, my husband and I ate at Texas Roadhouse on Remount Rd in Gastonia. We had the Fort Worth ribeye. The steak was cooked to perfection. My husband and I had baked potatoes and salads. Very good! For appetizers we had cactus blossoms and rattle snake bites . Absolutely yummy. The food was delicious but what made our meal even more enjoyable was our waitress Gwen. She was so friendly and made sure all our needs were meeting! Having waitresses like her are what make eating out enjoyable."}
{"text":"The first time at this Texas Roadhouse and everything was spot on! We ordered the Fort Worth Ribeye and it was cooked to perfection. Everything was so good and the waitress was nice and friendly. We will definitely come again at our next visit to Concord Mills Mall"}
{"text":"First timers. Went with my husband and 2 children as we were visiting Madison. Entered and was immediately greeted by a friendly hostess and a case of raw meat to look at. Lol. The girl who walked us to our table asked if it was our first time and I said yes and she was surprised. She explained the rolls were freshly baked every 5 min and the steaks were freshly cut when ordered. And they were known for their ribs.   Food: Checked into yelp and received the free cactus blossom. It was so tasty with a perfect crunch. The Cajun horseradish wasn't good. But that's because I don't like horseradish. So we opted for ranch dipping sauce instead. The rolls, omg are hot and fresh and served with cinnamon butter! So delicious!  I ordered the ribeye and ribs combo with veggies and seasoned rice. The ribeye practically melted in my mouth! The ribs were a bit dry. I didn't care for them. Didn't care for my sides either. I'm not a mashed potato person much but my husbands loaded mashed were really good. He got a sirloin and he said it was tasty as well. My older daughter got a chicken breast with mushroom, onion and gravy. She didn't care for it as much since it was dry.   Ambiance/interior: Loud country music..which I loved. A bit noisy which was fine. And a bit dark and crowded feeling. Didn't feel as clean either. But wasn't too bad.   Service: Hostess was friendly. Our server was friendly. No complaints.   Verdict: I definitely would come back for rolls and a ribeye again."}
{"text":"My daughter's best friend recommended this place and said everything on the menu would be fantastic. My young adult son and teenage daughter and I went on a Saturday, around 1pm. We were promptly seated, at a wooden booth.  A bucket of peanuts was already on the table, along with a basket of rolls and linen wrapped silverware. The peanuts were fresh and the rolls and cinnamon butter delicious! I ordered a (frozen) margarita, son a Cherry lemonade and daughter water with lemon slice   . The waitress then offered to refill our bread basket.  We promptly agreed and thanked her for the consideration. Everything on the menu looked delicious, so it took a while for us to choose. We couldn't hear the music for all the screaming babies seated at neighboring tables. We finally decided to order the combo appetizer which included cheesy potato skins, buffalo wings, snake bites (breaded jalapeno cheese balls). For lunch, I suggested my kids pick from the lunch time special ($8.99). My son chose smothered steak (sides french fries and corn), daughter grilled pork chop with peppercorn sauce (sides mashed potatoes and corn) and I opted for (blue ribbon) half slab rib (sides french fries and a salad). We didn't have to wait long for our appetizer to be served and had barely finished before our main course(s) had arrived. The food was plentiful. I was disappointed with the steak fries as they were mushy. The ribs, while tender and falling off the bone, were also mushy and seemingly water logged. I thought maybe the cow had been drowned! Of my entree, only the salad was great! I nibbled from my kids plates. My son's smothered steak was da bomb! My daughter's pork chop was dry as dust, even after she drowned it in sauce! ! For dessert, my son ordered the big brownie, daughter strawberry cheesecake and I ordered the apple pie. My final bill, for all of the above, was $81 not including the tip. We were all stuffed and couldn't complete our meal so we asked for plastic boxes to take our food home. They were promptly given.   Later, when I reheated my ribs at home, I was just as disappointed as I'd been at the restaurant. Overall, the service was great, decor great, floors a little greasy, noisy with all the  babies screaming, and  the food (although plentiful) left much to be desired. I wish I'd gone to the Big Apple instead."}
{"text":"Texas Roadhouse is your typical steak house. Tons of hungry families trying to get a decent meal that's cheap and tastes good. This location is very big, and was a bit crowded when we arrived. No complaints though, because it was a Friday night.  The servers, while busy, were very attentive and we got our food fairly quick. I have to say I love the rolls and the butter that comes with them YUM!  My boyfriend and I both got Ribeye Steaks,  medium. They were cooked they way we like them, but there was just way to much salt. While the steaks were juicy, we couldn't help but notice the overpowering salt flavor.   Normally previous Texas Roadhouse experiences have been alright, but this time my boyfriend got a rock in his salad, how does that happen? The good thing is he didn't chip or break any teeth biting down on it. The manager on duty, Sarah, was very understand and gave him his meal for free, the situation was handled well.   Overall our experience was ok, nothing that will keep us from coming in, or not coming again."}
{"text":"Five stars all around literally get Fridays once a week little pricey but that's the only issue I have with them thank you Freddy's for becoming my new addiction Cali burger for life!!"}
{"text":"mmmmm... oops  daydreaming about deelicious mouthwatering texas roadhouse yet again....   this is one of my go to places ( yes it is a chain) for a casual, very laid back fun night with awesome Margs and Barbeque.   Theres always been a wait, unless u call ahead, which i've never done since i'm all spontaneous like that.:)  I LUV the whole peanut on the floor thing, o and not to mention the rolls with cinnamon butter??!!  seriously,?? best idea ever!! i'm always in a food coma BEFORE my meal arrives.  The ribs are soo yummy, and the mashed potatoes, sweet potato, green beans with bacon, ugh its just all too good! I think i know where i'm going tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Has great food and fast service! You will be seated fast. I never waited more than 15mins even when it's busy"}
{"text":"First time here. Amazing steaks selection and very very low prices .Good bang for your buck . I.e. Bone in rib eye $ 25 .. Are u kidding me?! In Los  Angeles that would be $60! Or if you go to Alexanders steak house it would be $45 with paper napkins .   So this is the go to place. Just saying ..I ordered  bone in Rib Eye, fantastic flavoring . Just as good as the high  end steak houses I go to .  I will be back for sure to try the other steaks!   This place is a place to stop when your in the area.. Great service, paid attention to our every need  Special thanks to Bailey, our waitress.   Now I need to take two zocors..."}
{"text":"Our first stop once we entered AZ from SD. It was very busy for a Friday night. This spot is a very MILITARY appreciated restaurant!!!! Peanuts galore which I guess is their theme. As you walk in there is a huge barrel of peanuts to enjoy. Just help yourself to a cup full and throw the shells on the floor!!! That's right...throw the shells on the floor!!! Then when you arrive to your table they have a small bucket of nuts for you to enjoy while you wait for your food to arrive.  Our server Oscar was amazing! Constantly checking on us to see if wanted anything else and kept our drinks topped all night.  The food was ok. Nothing to write home about. By the time we arrived in AZ we were starving and just wanted some heavy eats after a 6hr drive. Sadly to us the food was not that memorable. But the customer service was superb!!"}
{"text":"Rolls. That is my primary reason for going to a place like this more than once. Texas Roadhouse has the best dinner rolls when they are served hot. Throw in the cinnamon butter and it's a little oral fiesta. I am NOT someone who likes going to Outback Steakhouse-type chains. I only set foot in Texas Roadhouse because I won a gift certificate. But considering the prices, the quality is more than decent. Their ribs are truly fall-off-the-bone. I had their country fried chicken which wasn't very greasy--points for that. They also serve really tasty catfish fillets that aren't dry and are flavorful. I also like how one of their many sides offerings includes sweet potatoes. And they are big potatoes. You can easily come away with leftovers which means, two meals for the price of one.   If you are not in the mood to be in a place where the wait staff highlights birthdays very loudly, then skip Roadhouse. When it's someone's b-day, they actually have the person sit on a saddle and get everyone to sort of \"yeehaw\" along. It's like a bad commercial. Anyway, I can see myself going into one if I'm in the neighborhood and want to splurge on food that isn't the healthiest."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, but the music is just too damn loud. Went there specifically at 4 o'clock in the afternoon to avoid the singing and dancing in the hallways and a very loud music to know avail. You can't hear yourself think. If you don't mind the loud music it's a great place to go but if you're trying to have a quiet meal forget it. I won't go back"}
{"text":"This place stinks! Their 91 rating is deserved, the hostesses were all very rude and continued to give my family dirty looks. When I asked politely how much longer on our wait of 6 .. mind you many parties the same size as ours we're getting sat ahead of us.   When we were walking out the door to go to another restaurant, overheard the hostess all say \"Finally they left, I didn't want them here anyways!\"   Never returning here ever again!"}
{"text":"Never had a problem with TX Roadhouse (here, in Texas, or even in Ohio). It's always an enjoyable spot with decent to delicious food. The steaks have always been good to me (I like to order medium or medium rare depending on my mood. Their rolls are light & fluffy, and their semi-sweet cinnamon butter is whipped & yummy. I recently discovered that I love their fried catfish! If you like it crispy, theirs will make you happy! Overall, I think its a great casual spot for family or just hanging out with friends when you're not in any hurry to go somewhere. 2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"This is exactly like a Lone Star - blaring country music, peanut shells all over the floor, odd mix of middle age folks. Moderate prices - I got 1/2 lb of chicken and 2 sides for $10 while my partner got grilled salmon and 2 sides for about the same. Maybe the service was bad because we happened to get in right before hundreds of people poured in to eat after grad ceremonies, but our waitress gave us our bill before we had even bitten into our food, never asked about dessert, and pushed a To-Go cup when my partner asked for a refill. We had only been there 20 minutes when the To-Go thing was pushed, and the waitress came back to our table and the one next to us every - and I mean every - 3 minutes of the entire fiasco. Plus they have this chanting-shouting thing there... Perhaps a coordinated dance? All we knew was that 4 times in the first 15 minutes we were there, the staff began pounding, clapping and chanting (really, shouting). The food was not bad, but it certainly was not good enough to overcome the noise and stalkerish, rushed service. I'm more inclined to say that this was not just a one time bad-service day because the place was full of teeny bopper waitresses with braces who never took away a dirty plate. More like never-had-waitressing-101. BUT it  was far enough from campus that I felt like I was really out with the community instead of UIUC students."}
{"text":"Worst time ever there. Staff was nice but the food was cold, took over 30 mins to get our food, the chicken fried steak was so salty I was done after the 3rd bite, and our waiter was terrible. I explained this to the waiter and he did offer to switch it with something else but it was too late."}
{"text":"YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH.  That's the sound you'll hear when it's someone's brithday.  They take the person whose birthday it is, put them on a mounted saddle, and have the entire restaurant join in for a good old country time.  Before I get too deep into my review, let me preface it by saying that this is definitely not a place that everyone will enjoy, as it can get noisy and the food portions are generous.  That said, I'm a big fan of the roadhouse.  When you first walk in to Texas Roadhouse, you're greeted by a large three-foot tall barrel of peanuts.  You'll also look on the ground and see peanuts shells scattered everywhere.  To some this might be a turn-off but I was really happy to see it as I love peanuts and anything made from peanuts.  You can eat them while you wait, and then once you're seated by the always friendly staff, you get your own personal bucket of peanuts to continue munching.  But moving on, you'll also be treated to another delicious free appetizer as you ponder over the menu items.  They bring out a basket of scrumptious bread with cinnamon butter.  Normally I wouldn't be a fan of this flavoring, but at the roadhouse it's done right as the bread is very warm and the butter is succulent.  There are free refills on this, so don't feel bad about asking.  The menu items themselves are pretty similar to the style of say a Famous Daves or a Chilis.  You've got your classic pulled pork, your ribs, your steak, your burgers, your chicken, etc.  I've had probably about 60% of their menu and never really been disappointed.  All the food was cooked well, and the ribs especially were impressive.  They fell off the bone just as the waitress assured us they would, and the sides included only added to the great flavor.  The establishment itself feels very suburban-style-forced, with your typical fare of decorations on the wall and a staff that seems to have the same line of training and attitude.  But for some reason, the overall feel of the place just rubs me right compared to other restaurants trying to do the same thing.  Maybe it's the fact that a lot of this could be considered comfort food, but hell, why not if it really is comforting.  Get on ur cowboy hat, and take a stroll into the Roadhouse.  YEEEEE-HAAAAh"}
{"text":"this place is great. they always take awesome care of us every time we come here. as a younger couple, a lot of places don't take my boyfriend and I seriously, but this place does. I always feel very respected and valued as a customer, and not just some dumb kid. Breanna has taken care of us 3 different times and has been incredible every time. The food is always on point, and when I got a not-so-great piece of filet, they took care of it right alway. they really know what outstanding customer service is and the food is unlike any other steakhouse in the area. I recommend 100%."}
{"text":"The rolls are awesome! Caesar salad was on point. The ribeye is to die for. My least favorite was the loaded mashed potatoes (which is normally my favorite). Great if you like loud environments."}
{"text":"I'll stick to the location in Mesa. It's close to our house but we got really bad service. Our entire order was wrong. Our waitress of course blamed it on the music and her hearing problems. We all ate at different times because we kept sending our food back. And to top it off, she assumed we didn't want our change. Why would I tip you so much for crappy service? No thank you."}
{"text":"We went to this Roadhouse about 6 months ago for dinner, we had a gift card and thought we would use it. The food was not so great that night, but we just decided not to come back. Well, we recently received another gift card and thought we would give them another try, big mistake, our experience here was worst than the last time! When we received our food my simple burger was too under-cooked, the fries were cold and the bun was stale. My wife ordered buffalo wings which came out dry and looked more like chicken nuggets, with no wing sauce. My wife called the waitress over and asked if they could add some wing sauce so they weren't so dry. The wings came back, but now had an oily liquid poured on them (the sauce looked like fryer grease with Tabasco sauce added to it, I'm not kidding.)  My daughter was eating her meal and found a black hair in her mashed potatoes. At this time, my wife and daughter were so grossed out that they couldn't eat anymore. Mu wife asked to speak with the manager who came over about twenty minutes later and instead of being apologetic, he was very defensive and stood by the quality of the food. He said he was sorry, but never offered to refund anything, my wife told him she refused to pay for the items and he finally took them off our bill. The food here is processed junk and is not worth eating someones hair, who knows what other surprises you might discover!"}
{"text":"Been here many times.  Have never been disappointed with meal or service.  To me it seems well managed.   Manager checks on tables frequently.   The steak is always done the way I order it."}
{"text":"Two hosts and the manager at the door. Nobody greeted us. I had to ask if we seated ourselves. Sigh. Server saved the day. Food was great. Service was great. I'll be back again. I know that next time we will wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Tonight's dinner was very good. I had the 8oz filet it was cooked great and tasted very good."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worst Texas Roadhouse locations, and I've been to quite a few!  The service was absolutely horrible, not to mention the facility wasn't very clean (see the photo of the shelf next to our table). Our server must have forgotten our order as it took way too long to get our food (close to an hour). The table that sat down next to us had their food before we even got our salads. The drinks took a very long time to get and refills were pretty much nonexistent. We never got additional dinner rolls that we asked for numerous times and the food quality was subpar to other locations I've been to. I wanted to leave a very small tip but was talked out of it by my better half. I felt compelled to ask to speak to a manager but we were on a time crunch since we were attending a concert at the nearby Ak Chin Pavilion. We won't be visiting this location again any time soon."}
{"text":"Went to dinner but was 15 mins late in using my free Onion blossom coupon... my mistake so I had to pay for it instead.  Had the Prime Rib with sauteed mushrooms and steamed vegetables.  The sautéed mushrooms were burnt and so was the 2nd batch.  It was mostly burnt and charred.  Thought I'd be healthy and ordered the steamed vegetables which consisted of carrots and broccoli.  They must have dumped a 1/4 cup of salt/seasoning in that cup.  I ate 1 piece of carrot and the broccoli was literally inedible.  I informed them of my displeasure.  The compensation to me was to give me a coupon for free appetizer for my next visit.  That would require me to come back to eat at your restaurant.  I have had excellent food there before... 7 or 8x before but not inclined to go back again.  I frequent Black Angus and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"This place was great! Your typical steak house casual environment with peanut shells on the floor!  My husband and I split an appetizer and entree and we left tons of food on the table! We started with the cactus blossom which was very tasty! We then had the 16 oz. prime rib that came with a huge side salad and loded potato!  Not to mention that our sweet waitress brought us a sample of the places signature ribs... they were really good as well as the complimentary bread! All of this and the price was great!  As for our waitress, Megan, she was such a sweetheart! Very attentive, very helpful, and has amazing customer service skills!  I would highly recommend this place! I promise you won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"If the requirement is you have to:  #1. Self service on the rolls and butter then this is your place.  #2. If you wait 30 minutes for your bowl of chili before you meal then this is your place.  #3. If your waitress (Sharitaa) insists that you are done and you need a take out container, even after you told her you aren't done; then this is your place. #4. If your wife is so tired of waiting for your the bill you tell her to go on home, then (yep you guess it, you're in the wrong place). #5. And Sharittaaa takes 15 minutes to bring back your card with the bill...you guess?  Normally very good, but not tonight...hit the reset button."}
{"text":"Worst Texas Roadhouse I have been to across the country. Every visit to Phoenix I try to make a trip to Texas Roadhouse since we do not have one in Vegas. I ordered a filet MR and the first time it came out it was cold and MW. I waited about 25 minutes for the first one. When i sent it back it took another 25 minutes for the second one. The second one was cold and brown as well!... unbelievable. I called the front house manager to relay my experience and she said \"do you want me to take your steak?\"  So after waiting for an hour.. she took my steak and threw it out and took it off my check. ZERO customer service. I went across the street to Chillies since I was starving. My food came out in 10 minutes.  What a waist of time and an embarrassment to Texas Roadhouse. I hope they address their issues of not being able to cook a steak at a steakhouse as well as their horrible management."}
{"text":"The service was okay, nothing special. The manager did check up on us twice, which was nice. this is a go-to chain steak house.  Things I really like: The TEA, the peanuts, Rolls, mushrooms.  Things that could be better: Price, faster service, quality of vegetable sides.    Most of the time I get the 12oz sirloin, salad, and baked potato,   Chain place that everyone can find something that they like, The food was okay  Overall, I gave it a couple of stars because it could have been better...a lot better. But a taste of home is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Yea.. sitting here at Texas Roadhouse right now. Been staring at the warm rolls for about 5 minutes now not being able to eat them because we don't have plates or Silverware."}
{"text":"Restaurant review: Inexpensive steak, free peanuts, and all you can eat dinner rolls with cinnamon butter. I use to really like texas roadhouse, but I don't know if my taste buds have changed or if the steak they made for me was really salty. We were lucky enough to get here early because there is a crazy long line for this place always. In addition the parking lot is crazy, too many pickup trucks and tight parking. You constantly are concern that your car is going to get hit or side swiped while eating. Servers are quick and efficient to keep the tide of customers through. I had the fort worth ribeye, cooked medium rare perfectly. The meat of course is not like you top notch steak house, but I don't remember it being so salty. You get two sides which is nice. I went with the baked potato with sour cream and chili. You get a nice unlimited serving of the yeast rolls which are delicious. Overall good, but not spectacular which is why it is a 3 star and not a 4 star..  Pro: inexpensive steak house, unlimited yeast rolls with cinnamon butter, free peanuts  Cons: super long line, if you come late please do the call ahead seating. Very salty steak, average quality meat. Very cramped parking lot, you might be better off parking at Schnucks and walking over  Hidden gem: Sign up for the online email club to get a free appetizer the first time. Free appetizer during your birthday month. Tuesday is kids day so come for food and activities."}
{"text":"I never ate fish before and yesterday I went their and got the grilled lemon pepper salmon, it was the beat choice I made to try fish. The service is great, the food is perfect, never had a problem their"}
{"text":"Steak was overdone and over salted. Everything else was fine. I'm giving such a low rating because if they can't do steak right..."}
{"text":"Work nearby and had an associate call out. Had a two hour break in between pulling a last minute double shift. Decided to check out TRH even though it was 630pm on a Saturday night.   Hostess informed me I could check out bar for free seats when a host stepped in, grabbed some fresh rolls and walked me to seat at the bar.   Two women working the bar gave my first class service. Food came in good time even though they were packed. Was checked in on at appropriate time intervals. Two dudes posted up next to me at the bar, and I could tell the staff was on alert to make sure I wasn't bothered. Well oiled machine of a staff they got going on here! Keep it up."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years. They never disappoint and the food is consistently good! The rolls and cinnamon butter are the best! Comfort food at its finest!"}
{"text":"I had previously posted 5 stars as I loved the food. Recently, my mom had mentioned she was taking her husband here for his birthday based on my recommendation. When she arrived, she was met by an extremely rude and RACIST pair of hostess. They continuously made fun of her French accent and said some very disrespectful comments about her. I am absolutely appalled by this behavior! I had been a patron here since it has opened and I was so upset that my mother was treated how she was. For this reason, and the failure of management action, I will not be dining at this establishment anymore."}
{"text":"My only experience at this location was pretty bad. I've eaten at the Stately location a few times and always felt like Roadhouse was a decent place to get a good steak without spending too much. Now, I'm not so sure. We were in on the 4th hoping to grab a good holiday meal.  I ordered the 12 oz. ribeye, medium-rare and the steak that came out was thin, charred, and far overcooked. Dark grey interior and dry char on the plate when I cut it open. I'm used to ribeye being a thick cut, well marbled cut and this was neither.   They replaced my steak with a NY strip, telling me the ribeye is \"hard to cook\" and the strip is a thicker cut. A while later, the strip came out to pair with my cold sides and empty Arnold Palmer. While it looked to be properly cook, for some reason it sat glistening on the plate like they dumped water on it to add juice. And that's how it tasted. No salt, no pepper; a slab of flavorless meat.   My friends finished eating well before me, and the checks were dropped before I finished \"enjoying\", going me to consume the leather and sawdust that was in my mouth. I was surprised to look at the bill. They didn't comp anything, didn't offer to buy my appetizer, no offer for dessert, and actually charged me more for the strip than my initial order. Good up-sell inattentive server. That was $40 I'll never get back.  Happy 4th of July everyone!"}
{"text":"On our way back from Carbondale for the eclipse of we stopped by to get some food. Our server Kelsie was amazing!! She was such a sweet heart and knew we were in a hurry to get back on the road. She was quick, efficient and even sent us home with a box of rolls for the road. I probably won't be back since it was just a stop on the road, but was definitely satisfied with my choice."}
{"text":"The steaks are great. The bread is definitely worth breaking your diet for.  The staff was amazing.  Very attentive and treated us like royalty.  We went here for my son's 7th birthday and the girls were so nice to him. He had a great time.  Thank you ladies."}
{"text":"Waited 10 mins to have a server take our drink order, and when he finally showed up, he reeked of cigarette smoke.  The restaurant wasn't even crowded and another waitress saw us sitting there waiting and didn't say anything.  We typically love our meals here but unfortunately the service has gone way downhill."}
{"text":"This place has had bad luck with us... 1. Charred mini burgers on one trip 2. Over cooked a medium rare steak- mngr offered another and we accepted- it was more cooked than first 3. Tried it one last time- my friend found a hair in her salad....  We're done... Service was great, prices good- quality not good."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying, I rarely leave Texas Roadhouse unsatisfied. The steaks are the best you can find and the atmosphere is fun. I have recently had several terrible servers. They have been forgetful and messed up drinks and side requests. The last two times I have been there, the steaks have been way under cooked. I have to order my steak medium well to get a medium rare steak. I ordered medium rare today and the steak was so rare that the entire thing was red even on the sides on the outside. No pink at all. Overall I like the food but some things are needing improvement."}
{"text":"They give you so much food! All of their sides are super fresh and I am never disappointed. The staff is always very friendly and the service is great. My go-to place for steak on the eastside"}
{"text":"Y'all we have not been to Texas Roadhouse in years. But it's my cousin favorite restaurant and she always raves about the bread; my husband and I was looking for a convenient place to eat for our family and Texas Roadhouse was a 5 min drive from our hotel.   When we arrived the parking lot was packed! But we were able to find a parking space in the front of the restaurant which was great. The parking was very clean but the spaces are tight. So if you have kids tell them to be very careful of the cars parking next to you.   When we first walked in the entrance reeked of urine. Like the smell was horrible so much so that I asked my husband if he wanted to stay and he said yes! But as we got closer into the restaurant the smell wasn't there anymore. (It's weird because the bathrooms aren't near the entrance)   They have an area in the front where you can choose your own steak. My husband decided to not pick his steak but I thought that was cool. We sat on the side of the restaurant in a corner which was perfect for us. The restaurant is kind of dimmed.   We ended up ordering the 6oz sirloin with rice + corn, the shrimp with rice + veggies, 2 Mac and cheeses and we kept getting refills on the bread. Y'all the bread is soooo good. The food was absolutely delicious and hot. My steak literally melted in my mouth; everyone else felt their food was good too. (They also have peanuts)   Our server name was Karley and she wore a blue hat. She was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! We never had to ask for anything, she was nice + patient with us. She was very enthusiastic and seemed happy to be at work.   The bathrooms were decent which was good for small children because they like to touch stuff. We ended up paying a little under $40 which is a great value.   Overall awesome food, okay restaurant and amazing staff."}
{"text":"Really Disappointing  I drove across town to eat here after reading the mostly positive reviews. I reviewed their menu before going there, and ordered based on some of the feedback I read.   I had called ahead in order to minimize my wait time for a table, and when I arrived, there were lots of people waiting to be seated. I was glad I had called. When I checked in, they said it would be about 10 minutes to be seated, so I decided to eat at the bar, which had plenty of room. I requested a class of club soda, and she brought it right away. I didn't realize she would ring it up as a sprite and charge me for it. I couldn't tell you the last time I was charged for club soda other than when in San Francisco. If I'd know, I would have just had water.  The bartender got back to me relatively quickly to take my order, especially given that she was serving the bar and several tables too. I ordered the 14 oz. Ft. Worth Rib Eye medium rare with sautéed mushrooms on the side, a side of corn, and a side of green beans. The bartender immediately brought me a basket of their rolls with cinnamon butter. The rolls were piping hot, and great with the cinnamon butter, but I was saving myself for my entrée so I stopped after sampling them.  My dinner came out fairly quickly, and luckily the bartender came over almost immediately to ask me how my food was. It was a good thing. They had served the steak smothered with the sautéed mushrooms rather than providing them on the side, and my steak was cooked medium well - way to done for me. I had thought I would be ok, because I had ordered according to their menu description of \"doneness levels\". I showed her where I had cut into the middle of my steak, and she agreed that it was way too done. She said she would take care of it and took it back to the kitchen. A short time later the service manager brought me a fresh dinner, with a medium rare steak (I checked it while the bartender watched), and the mushrooms in a dish on the side. The service manager indicated that she had made sure because they want their customers to be satisfied.  For the price, I can't complain about the steak, only that it didn't come out correct the first time, but it was on the salty side. Luckily, the mushrooms weren't salty at all, so they balanced each bite of my steak. It was a little on the tough side, but tasty, and I was hungry.  After a few bites of steak, I tried my sides of corn and green beans. The green beans I simply didn't like. There was some sort of tough meat in them that I don't think was bacon, but didn't recognize. They were also too salty to eat. I tried the corn, but it also was too salty to eat, and drowned in something that didn't taste like real butter to me. It was just salty corn in salty oily liquid. Of my entire meal, only my steak and sautéed mushrooms were edible. The steak wasn't good enough to earn a good rating for this overall experience.  After I ordered, my tab had been placed in a glass in front of me. When I was finished eating, I put my credit card in the glass and turned it so the bartender would see it. I probably sat there for 10 minutes before she noticed, and I could not get her attention because she was very busy at tables. It wasn't a problem because I wasn't in a hurry, and was reading a good book. She didn't even question that my side dishes were uneaten, and I didn't feel like complaining any more. I was just ready to go.  As I drove home after eating, one review I had read lodged in my thoughts. It was a poor rating from a diner who had been there several times and had hit and miss experiences. They said that when it was good, it was great, and when it was not it was terrible.  As I continued to think about the ratings I had read, there had been several about the how salty the food sometimes was. I guess I went on one of the days that the cook was heavy handed with the salt.  My experience wasn't terrible, but I think I went when the kitchen was having a bad day. It's too long a drive from my home to go back again. I would not recommend The Texas Roadhouse to friends."}
{"text":"Great steak!  Cooked to perfection!   Great sides (baked potato and ceasor salad)!  Great service and atmosphere!   Price was reasonable!   Can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"At the bar you're invited to help yourself to free peanuts and toss the cracked shells on the ground around you.  Friendly, inexpensive, and as rowdy and casual as a place can possibly be without crossing over into dive territory.   We had a party of 11 people, and were quickly seated at the bar for some casual mingling. The service was friendly, attentive, and accommodating. The food was normal American food at reasonable prices.   My wife had a steak that was cooked to a nice medium rare and tender, though grisly. The other bar food was great and perfectly greasy to fit the atmosphere.  Not a place for quiet conversation on gourmet fair, but the perfect spot to knock back a few cold brews while watching the game with friends."}
{"text":"They forgot about us twice and hours later our food arrived.  Ribs are a thin bark on a fatty covered bone.  You get what you pay for.    Rolls are amazing.  It's a chain and all that a chain usually offers.   Nice bar but we won't be back.  We'll avoid the entire chain."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that it took us so long to try this place. This place is awesome! It has a real casual atmosphere with sports, great music and peanut shells on the floor, but combines it with some seriously good food. We have been here twice now and have been blown away by the food and service.   Upon entering you are brought to your seat with delicious hot bread and soft butter. It's so great to have something to eat the moment you are seated. It's so hard to resist filling up on this amazing bread!  My wife's steak was cooked to perfection and we love the Caesar salad. I tried the ribs last time and could not believe how tender and delicious they were. I have also tried the chicken fried chicken and loved that too.   The servers have been cheerful knowledgeable and proessional. Combine all of this with very reasonable prices and you have a winner. I seriously looked up at my wife after seeing the bill and said \"this can't be right\" cause it was so cheap.  We will definitely make this a new regular spot for us to have dinner. Bravo."}
{"text":"My wife had ribeye I had filet both were great! We had the grilled shrimp appetizer (yeah I know, who orders shrimp in a steakhouse) but this was a very tasty dish! Will order again."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food, reasonable prices. I always try to come here when I visit since there are no roadhouses in CA near where I live."}
{"text":"We came here for birthday dinner for my daughter to celebrate her 5th birthday. I checked in and was surprised to see that I was able to get a free appetizer because I checked in. We had a good meal but our waitress forgot my husbands one side which was a bowl of chili. The manager fixed it. We had the do the birthday thing they do. Which was all fun and such.  My husband is a snoot and wouldn't let me look at the bill only to find out that they never took off the appetizer"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here twice but both times ive been pleasantly surprised by the price.  I'm no steak connoisseur but I love me some dead bloody cow that's cooked right.  Both times our waitress was pleasant- that's right \"waitress\", and I just assume that I'm going to get nickel and dinged for everything. Don't get me wrong, they're always trying to upsell you with certain fixings, but it's mostly low key.  I am now sold on this place.  2 adults, 2 kids, blooming onion, big beer- under $65 out the door"}
{"text":"Can't beat it for the price.  I've had steaks that cost 3 or 4 times as much and these are just as good. This place delivers on food quality and service every time.  Steaks are always done exactly correct (we like medium) and the sides are excellent.  The servers are friendly and anticipate your needs.  My fiancée wanted to take home the last roll and asked our server for a small box for it.  Instead of bringing just a box for the roll our server brought us a to-go box with 6 fresh rolls!"}
{"text":"Very good food at decent prices. We always go up before 6pm on weekdays for their 8.99 special. I get the 6oz sirloin, baked potato, and salad. You can't beat that deal!"}
{"text":"Good visit. Our waiter Izzy was very prompt and to the point. Food arrived fast and was cooked to satisfaction."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service (Luis) was just simply remarkable.  He was very attentive, had our delicious food ready in record time and my party of 4 had a great and wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"I really love this place except for a little long waiting time. However, you could call ahead to let staff put you in a line before departure. My friends and I always enjoy free honey bresh-baked bread and traditional blooming onion(with yelp check in).  Medium (little pink in center) ribeye topped with mushroom and onion is my favorite. Sides such as sweet potato and buttercorn are popular among my friends. The service is good as well."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. Tip- if you like spicy get the rattlesnake bites. Our server Rob was a great server, very helpful.  We come at off times to avoid long waits."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Texas Roadhouse, but I am starting to grow weary of repeated wrong orders at this location. I usually order the same thing each time and I normally get it to go. I don't think it's hard to get a grilled chicken Caesar salad with extra Caesar dressing on the side correct. My last order they forgot the extra Caesar, I didn't realize it until I got home. This time, I received the extra dressing but they were both ranch, not Caesar. How disappointing is that. Then when I called to let them know, they left me on hold so long that I eventually hung up.  Clearly, they aren't that busy on a Wednesday evening."}
{"text":"Service has been great both times my husband and I have been here. Wish I could remember our server's name but he was awesome! Very friendly and we were laughing and having a great time with him. I ordered the sirloin and it was cooked perfectly and very tender! My husband's burger was huge! Very happy and will be back."}
{"text":"This place is always packed.  Food is great, price is cheap, service is great.  Every 30 minutes, the staff do a line dance which is pretty entertaining.  Prime Rib here is the best!  16 oz for 20 bucks.  Can't beat that!  Unfortunately, you have to come early enough otherwise prime rib runs out."}
{"text":"Really wanted a steak and didn't want to pay the ridiculous prices at Longhorn Steakhouse, so decided to try this place. The service was great and my steak was flavourful and cooked to perfection. However, my mashed potatoes (ordered baked) were cold as were my girlfriend's. Didn't want to complain about the mix-up because I didn't want the food to be thrown out and wasted. My girlfriend ordered the Veggie dinner and everything was overcooked, bland and not worth consuming. Might decide to eat here again, but if I do, it'll be during the early bird special. Give the place a shot, but expect inconsistent quality."}
{"text":"Always a great time at Texas Roadhouse. I took my mother there last night for her birthday and again we had great service, delicious food, and they even did a \"yeehaw\" for her birthday! The bread and cinnamon butter is worth a trip there on its own :)"}
{"text":"We arrived at 4:30  and asked for a table, not a booth. Was told it would be 5-15 minutes. Approximately 15 minutes later our Buzzer went off.  Well you can guess, we were taken to a booth.  It was a very small one at that.  We told her our request and she tried to seat us in the bar. That wasn't going to be a date night atmosphere. We were told we would have to wait AGAIN.   Amazing that there was a huge section with open sitting that had tables.  We decided to leave and go elsewhere.    The sad part was that she didn't offer an apology at all.  This is one of our favorite restaurants and have been eating here at this unit since 2003.   We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Seated quickly, great service, drinks always topped off. Good food and old western-ish atmosphere. Reasonable prices. Bar looked well stocked. Decent selection of alcohol. Nothing is particularly \"wow\" about this place. They serve steaks. Appears to be a popular spot for senior folk. Booths are small and don't move, request a table if you're a larger person."}
{"text":"Just moved here and I have been here twice. The ribeye and spare rib combo is sooooo good. This will be my regular steak house."}
{"text":"I came in here when I first moved to CLT to eat because I know and love Texas Roadhouse. This is a chain so I knew what to expect, huge steaks, awesome yeast rolls, and a decent seafood selection. I had the ribs and steak because I was feeling a little Ron Swanson.   The first basket of rolls they brought me were awful. I can't tell you how disappointed I was, they brought out another basket which was slightly better but lacking compared to what I am used to. They were hard and dry, but because I love carbs, I still ate a couple ;)  My waitress was pleasant and took my order promptly. I got rattlesnake bites as an appetizer and they came out quickly (and were delcious!). They sent the wrong meal out with the food runner but the manager and waitress were quick to apologize and make it right. The steak was cooked perfectly and my only complaint is that they charged me for onions (I wasn't told it was extra when the waitress suggested it - typical).   Overall, it's a good place to go if  you're craving steak, but they have a pretty decent selection of meals.   I have gone back since my first experience or carryout and everything was fine, rolls were good and salad was perfect. I'm sure I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Went here on my birthday.  Was sent a free appetizer coupon.  Food was good as always.  Service was why I'll come back.  It was unbelievable.  Will definetly come back."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent food and service. First time awesome, loved it. A week later, horrible! Steak was mostly fat, did nothing to rectify it. Hot veggies- cold, 20 minutes to get our drinks after being seated, requests were slow and at times had to be reminded. Repeats are a flip of the coin."}
{"text":"Last night for dinner my Texas T-bone was under cooked and tough. Returned and was brought another T-bone under cooked and tough. Half rack of ribs were old and dry, sirloin overcooked. I ordered Mug a Rita (margarita in a mug) advertised in the lobby for $2.49. Paid my bill and at home realized they charged my $12 for my two Mug a Rita's. Server great, noise, food sucked, won't be back. Best steaks are from a meat market and grilled at home on my Weber. Wish I had my $100 back. Oh, get rid of the cinnamon butter. Yuck!!"}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could. Had a party of 11 that included a brother with special needs and a newborn.  With that being said I called 2 hours in advance to reserve seating.  When I got there they said that it would be 10 minutes and kept on being told there was a party ahead of us that had already paid and was just hanging out so once they are done we will get the table.  After I left to go stand and wait, the hostess told another person the same thing so I was thinking so are we getting the table or are they.  We waited a total of 30 mins before we left.  They were not willing to work with me at all, with their hostess attitude I would rather spend our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Its a typical chain restaurant but they actually do it right. The fillet migon I had was excellent, actually cooked to the temperature that I asked. They let me switch out the rice for another side and they have some pretty good healthy options for sides. The waitstaff were busy but still quick and friendly. They accept all major credit cards."}
{"text":"One of my top 5 favorite restaurants EVER and this location lives up to the Texas Roadhouse  reputation! I love their Chicken Fried Steak. Their rolls are the best rolls on the planet and get this, they are FREE. I would pay and drive \"1,000 miles\" to bring those beautiful rolls home and just look at them! I've lived in TX before, so this is just a very cool thing to experience. Cool atmosphere, cute two-stepping chicks, and great food. Eat their FREE peanuts and throw the shells on the floor, TEXAS STYLE! YEEHAWWW!"}
{"text":"My son picked this place for his bday dinner as he had been here before and liked it - since it was his pick off we went.  We went for dinner last night (easter) arrived at 5:15 and it was definetly crowded, but we were greeted quickly and sat immediatly.  I love how the hostess brings the hot rolls and cinnamon butter as she is seating you.   Those rolls were delish!!  Our waitress came shortly after and took our drink and appetizer order.  Our appetizer came quickly and she took the rest of our order.   All through the experience, our waitress was very friendly and frequented our table just enough times - not too much and not to little.  the food is where the issue lays...we had the cheese fries for appetizer (bday boy pick) - basic steak fries topped with lots of cheese and bacon - sounds good right?   well they were, but they were also topped with way too much of a salt seasoning - we were able to pick through some, but it was just too much.  the boys ordered fall off the bone ribs - which they were and they seemed to enjoy them.  Pulled pork was also ordered and was given an \"good\"   - the star of the meal was chicken fried chicken - huge portion, pounded thin, deep fried, and covered with a white gravy.  How could you go wrong there?    The sides were good - loaded mashed potatos, basic salad, applesauce.  The chili was also ordered and again loaded with salt - couldn't be eaten.    there was a mix up with not all sides being brought to our table, but the waitress quickly fixed that.  the portions are big and we took most of it home - no room for dessert.  quick note:  the bathroom was disgusting and that alone would make it hard for me to return.  if the bathroom is so dirty what does the kitchen look like?"}
{"text":"Had a belly-filling meal here the other night.  Granted, I still remember going to the Pineville location (like many others), but this one is an exact clone.  Talking to our hostess/seating person, a lot of people from Pineville take the drive out here to get their Texas Roadhouse fix in.  It was a pretty busy Friday night, but we got seated after about 10min of waiting.  I think it was pretty laughable that they have a \"bull pen\" area....  your number gets called up, you get paraded in front of a refrigerated case to pick a possible 16oz steak... and then stand and talk to the hostess for another minute in the bull pen area while they are cleaning off the table.  I guess it takes away the awkward standing and watching people bust their butts to clean the table for you.  Fresh baked rolls with cinnamon butter are presented and promptly eaten.  There is a bucket of peanuts on the table that you can par-take in (as if there isn't enough food in this place).  This particular night, I went with the ribs and they fell off the bone, and were pretty tasty.  As my two sides, I chose the ceasar salad and baked potato.  Ended up waddling out of the place due to two 20oz beers and all the food.  Looking back, I really over ordered... also got a \"baby blossom\" but I have not been that full in a long long time.    Our server was nice and friendly and we didn't have to wait long on the food at all."}
{"text":"This is my first experience with a Texas Roadhouse.  Normally I avoid chains all together and my experience here confirmed my reasons why.   A few friends and I decided to meet in the Concord Mills area because it is centrally located.  We decided on this restaurant because it received better reviews than some of the other area establishments.   I arrived first and got a table for the group.  Everything seemed rush rush with the hostess to the server,  In fact our server spoke so fast that I could barely understand her when she was running through something from the menu.  The other thing that's odd here is for larger groups, they put a 2 seater table in the walkway next to a booth which makes it awkward to get in and out of the booth and I would think it would be a fire hazard as well.    Menu-wise, they have steaks chicken, ribs and everything you would expect to see at a steak joint.  Unfortunately, there are very few healthy items on the menu.  Anything you think would be healhy like veggies, salads, etc are loaded and smothered with extra ingredients like sugar, salt, cream and therefore taking counteracting any healthy qualities.    I ordered the 12 oz. NY Strip medium rare.  There was nothing medium rare about it.  It was more like medium to medium well with very little pink color.  There was also no flavor to the steak.  I had to use A1 to give it flavor.  I also had a sweet potato with butter.  That was the best thing I had today here but it's hard to screw up a sweet potato.  A summary of this place is it's a chain and not a very good one.  If you want a good steak from a chain, go back into Charlotte or up a few exits on 85 and hit a Longhorn.  They are much better and they have healthy options and better bread!"}
{"text":"I love Texas Roadhouse, but this particular location was not the greatest. We were a party of 2 and were seated quickly after it took a few minutes to get us to the correct table (they took us to a dirty table, then a table with someone sitting there, and on the third attempt we got a table). The service was good, so no complaints there. The manager checked in on us which is always a plus. The food could have been a little hotter and a little more seasoning would not have hurt. If I'm in the area again, I probably wouldn't go to this location as they seem a little unorganized as the seating issue happened to another patron. Love the chain, just not the location."}
{"text":"Always have had a consistently good service here. It's a go to place for good food and beers. I haven't had a very bad waiter yet. The one problem I had was we were seated before our waiter clocked in for the day, which left us sitting for a while, but the manager apologized and gave us a free appetizer for our wait, which we were happy with.   Overall, the food is always consistently good, and the rolls are awesome. The wait on Fri/Sat night is pretty bad though, and the call ahead seating can be a little confusing since I've done it and then seemed to still wait a long time."}
{"text":"This Gilbert, AZ. Texas Roadhouse is by far one of the better restaurants in the chain..not that there are many bad ones. We had been traveling from California a couple times a month to visit family and we made it a point to go to this location 3961 South Gilbert Rd. It takes us 30 minutes to get there from our hotel. We pass another Texas Roadhouse, the Mesa location  (which I would not recommend)  on the way to the Gilbert Rd location.  Our server last night was Kelly. What a joy she was. Kelly had everything timed perfect between our drinks, the Rattlesnake Bites, the salads, main meal and dessert. Of course the filet and sirloin just melt in your mouth. I wish that we could get a Texas Roadhouse in Southern California.. I know a lot of people that would very happy, especially if it is like this one in Gilbert!   It is obvious that the employee's at this location enjoy their job and want to be there. Thank you Texas Roadhouse.  It is a NON smoking restaurant...a Big plus. I do wish that the ash trays were a little bit farther away from the door. But over all it is great!!"}
{"text":"Usually it is very good. Not today. My steak was first burned to a crisp then it was rare. I asked for medium rare. Everyone's fopd was delivered separately. By the time i was done eating my sister hadnt even been served."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is def worth the wait! Between the food and the atmosphere, this is the place to be! My favorite!"}
{"text":"A great place for a meal. They have a great bone in ribeye for a steak cooked in a restaurant. Me being a grill master when it comes to steak means I always have to compare to mine when giving a review. It is a good steak. You will have to add more salt and pepper to your own taste and that's ok since they are trying to please all palates, but that makes them lose a star. A meal purchased at a restaurant should always be seasoned properly."}
{"text":"Come here at least 2x a month. Get the same thing. NY strip steak with sweet potato and veggies! Always comes hot and cook to perfect order. It's always chaos in there but the servers never mess up and never long wait on food. Appreciate the call ahead seating! Always a joy to go in n sit down with in 15 mins MAX! Thanks for awesome food and service!"}
{"text":"Three Stars because I really dislike their rude hosts and their rule of \"We won't add you to the queue until your entire party is here.\" We had to wait an extra 45 mins because once my brother arrived, we had to wait again to be seated although we gave them our name when we arrived. There is lots of parking, the food is good, some of the waitstaff is attentive and friendly. If you have a peanut allergy, avoid this place. From the minute you step in the front door, there's a huge bin of peanuts for people to eat. Shells and peanut dust everywhere throughout the restaurant."}
{"text":"What was great: the ribs here are fantastic.  I've had them twice and they were great both times. Meaty and not fatty. They know how to cook meat.  The prime tin wad done perfectly.   What I wasnt crazy about: the chili yuck.  Skip it. I usually love chilli. The seasoning was weird and the meat in it was grizzle that I had to spit out.  I ended up returning it for fries. Those were great. The service was mediocre.  The server forgot to get us things we had asked for.    I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"We like this place.  I have to admit, when you walk into a place and realize the floor is covered with peanut shells, you might think twice about wearing flip flops, or entering in the first place for that matter!  The service was fast and friendly.  I liked that they offered us samples of their popular sides, and gave us a bag of peanuts for free.  The food is what you might expect from a Cracker Barrel, which isn't a bad thing, but isn't exactly date night worthy.   This is a great place to take kids-- the atmosphere is very loud and casual, and you definitely won't leave hungry.  We'll probably go back... Eventually!"}
{"text":"Not the first Texas Roadhouse I have been to (been to the Las Ceruces, NM and the west-side El Paso, TX location).  They all have good quality food that makes for a good dinner.  What made this one stand out?  The music was at a volume where we could actually have a conversation at the table.  I wish they would do this at all locations!  Usually, you can't hear yourself think in a Texas Roadhouse, at least from my other experiences."}
{"text":"We were traveling trough and stopped here without really knowing anything about this specific Texas Roadhouse location. We were pleasantly surprised! Out waitress was friendly and attentive. Food was prepared just right. Medium stake was indeed medium. Baked potatoes were great. Both my husband and I agreed we got a new appreciation for TR."}
{"text":"Went to the Roadhouse on Tuesday. Did not have any wait time. Were seated in a corner booth where we watched all the fit people going in and out of the gym. As usuaI, I forgot to take pictures. Waitress was very cordial. Ordered a New York 12oz strip, medium well, steak fries and seasoned rice. When the food arrived they ask you to look at the steak if you want to see if it was cooked as requested. I did not cbeck. The rice was good with a tiny kick to it. The ranch fries were fries, nothing special. I had the steak smothered in sauteed in onions. The steak was trimmed well of fat. Cutting into the steak it was cooked as ordered. It was delicious. Just enough seasoning and juicy. 12oz thick steak was a lot of meat. I did not finish my fries. I only had to cut off 2 small fat pieces. Other than that, I was very happy with my choice. Almost forgot, rolls with flavored butter are given to the table when your drinks arrive. Those rolls were soft and some of the best I've tasted from a resturant. I will return to The Roadhouse. BTW.  the manager stopped by and asked us if all was ok."}
{"text":"From top to bottom this is the unfriendliest staff I have ever encountered in any place of business."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. If you are in a hurry don't go on Friday or Saturday evenings. It is a very popular place to eat. We each ordered a pork platter dinner for $9.99 that came with two sides. They give you so much food there is no way you could eat it all. The food is so good that it takes a lot of will power to stop while your pants are still able to stay buttoned and zipped. So, so, so, good."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went here last Saturday for an early dinner. There was a short wait of about 15-20 minutes not that big of a deal since you could eat peanuts out of the barrel. We were seated and the service my our waitress was pleasant and fast. My husband ordered a chicken salad and I ordered the 6oz sirloin well done. When our food arrived his salad was fine but when I cut into my steak it was red. No slightly pinkish brown but the whole middle was red. I kindly asked the server if they could take it back and provide me a steak well done. She assured me that she told the kitchen the right thing so it wasn't that she made a mistake. So I kept my potato and nibbled on that while I waited for my steak to come back. Minutes later and my potato finished my steak comes pretty black and shriveled with the same piece I had cut off and examined. Here's my thing... I believe when something leaves the kitchen that it should NEVER return and then be placed back on the grill. When we politely addressed the issue of obtaining a new steak the cook took it back with a tiny bit of resistance after trying to explain that it was fine to just eat the steak. Once my new steak came out it looked amazing. It wasn't blacken for it to be well done and it was juicy. I was taken back a little when the manager came out to deliver it and when we explain to him our concern about placing food back on the grill he just stated that they ask and do that sometimes when people don't want to wait for another one to be cooked. We were never asked and I told him that. He never once apologizes for the mistake made and didn't seem concerned at all. Maybe I am making a big deal out of this but I could have touched the steak with my hands or couched, sneezed, or licked what have you.... And then it would have been thrown back on the grill with everyone else's food who was eating that night. Turns my stomach and I wish that the customer service was better for the manager to take some responsibility and ownership. Oh and in case you were wondering we payed for the full meal and we won't be going back to this location anymore."}
{"text":"Every once on a while you get a hankering for a steak.  A big ol' slab of beef charbroiled and served with bread, salad and a spud.  Add a margarita and life is good.  This is a good place to fulfill that need there on \"Steak Parkway\" along Metrocenter. (That in its self is a strange phenomenon)  It is good to get a bucket of peanuts on the table along witb war. bread as soon as you sit down and the service is great.  They do the scheduled dance thing that is a little silly.  The food is cooked as requested, is Texas sized and served with a smile.  Only small complaint - a tad salty.  Otherwise good when you got a beef jones."}
{"text":"Well, I've been here countless times....and this is my favorite steakhouse ever! I like how this restaurant is designed . Very homie...makes you feel you're dining in your own table in your house. I don't know it just gives me that kind of vibes..well I guess because of their cabin inspired design..those bricks of woods, animals heads LOL..I know it's weird they have those, but I like them hehe.  of course their foods are excellent! and my favorite is their freshly baked rolls! they make me forget about my diet LOL!! Their staffs are always nice, friendly and attentive to the needs of each of their customers which is of course very important!  That's it! Just keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I have been in to this Texas Roadhouse a few times now. I have no complaints! The atmosphere, the service, the food - it was all great!  The building is easy to find, right off the interstate on 151. Lots of parking. The inside of the restaurant is decorated with lots to look at, but not in a cheesy way. The booths are large and comfy. It always seems to be super busy inside, but they do a good job of keeping a ton of staff on hand so you never feel like you're waiting to be served.   The steaks are pretty darn good. I had the Dallas Filet last time, and I ate every last bit. It was good. The seasonal veggies it came with (my choice of several options) were pretty bland and seemed as though they needed to be cooked longer, but that wasn't really a big deal. The steak was filling and I didn't even miss the veggies.   It's a steakhouse, so I recommend eating the steak if you go, but I have had other non-steak items on the menu and they have all been tasty as well.   Overall, it's a pretty good option as far as chain places go. I have always been happy with my visits."}
{"text":"Steaks are awesome! Bread is awesome! Service is good most of the time, but not always. Still think outbacks blooming onion kills roadhouses. But the steaks are on another level! Good job!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite steakhouse - anywhere in the country! Consistent food, good service and family friendly atmosphere. This one is no exception."}
{"text":"Dined here tonight with the hubby, and I have to say that this place was crowded, but we were seated within 15 minutes. We were seated where we could keep an eye on the cooks...Lol We ordered the grilled chicken salad. The salads were fresh, but the rolls were doughie. We did end up asking for more rolls, and the 2nd set were better. Overall it was an alright experience."}
{"text":"I usually go to the one on power rd for wild west wedesday well since we were in the area we went to this one . well the wild west steak here is 8oz for 9.99 an at the one on power is 11oz for 9.99 I asked for the mgr whosaid she has no control over that i told her if we didnt have our drinks i would have left she asked if there was anything she could do Isaid yea give us the 11oz for 9.99 she said she didnt have the power i told her i would never come back to this one if thats the case she didnt seemed concerned never offered anything.I dont know why each location is different  also the mens urinal was backed up and the bathroom ws filthy and this was at 5:30 pm not like it was late at night I SUGGEST ANYONE WHO WANTS A 11 OZ GO TO THE TEXAS ROAD HOUSE IN GILBERT ON POWER RD ."}
{"text":"Four of us had lunch here on New Year's Eve while on vacation. It was my first visit to a Texas Roadhouse, and I will likely be back.   We started out with the fried pickles--any place I see them on the menu, I always try them. Fried pickles could've been thicker slices, but were cheap at $3.99. The pickle to batter ratio just seemed low--they may have been better if they were spears instead of slices.  Sirloin beef tips were really good--meat was cooked exactly as ordered. I absolutely LOVED thebaked sweet potato! I think I will try to replicate it at home...Yum. Our server was very accommodating w/ extra rolls and refills on soda.  The most interesting thing I found was that 6 people said have a nice day/Happy New Year as we were leaving. I found that to be a little out of the ordinary, but in a good way of course!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service but it's quite noisy and that makes it tough to have a conversation across the table. We've been here several times. Always good food and service but also always noisy."}
{"text":"Called to see if they have a catering menu and was surprised to find out they did.  Worked with the manager Peter to get the order placed and he was very nice.  We ordered 10lbs of the pulled pork, as well as two sides (corn and mashed potatoes) hoping it would be enough for 20 people.  The food was amazing and there was plenty!!!  Thank you Texas Roadhouse for making things easy and delicious!"}
{"text":"It was disappointed that one person of the party ordered ribeye medium but got well done steak when it brought to our table, then we have waited for another 40 mins to get the ribeye took to our table. The steak was not cooked inside a good temperature grill, and it was cold. The lady brought the second steak to our table seems like their manager, but she didn't say sorry or anything, just asked if the steak was medium and then left. The waitress did asked ten times if we got the steak back, but did nothing just kept asking. Something was missing at their customer service process, waiting time was too long, and people was not accountable for the mistake, and fixed it slowly.we left good tips as always, but what to express the unpleasant experience here."}
{"text":"This is such a consistent cheap place. The service is always the same and good. Cheap meals and cheap apps too. Good place! not fancy but just regular! I like the friend pickles and i like it when appetizers are 4$ not 10$ so you can try one even though you won't finish your meal, ya know???"}
{"text":"First rate service. Great steaks. Great place. The manager even came by the table because he heard we were here for the first time...."}
{"text":"I been to many of these Across the USA and maybe tonight was just a off night but this was very poor.  The service was slow could not buy a second roll as we asked three times. The food was only warm   Again maybe a bad night but still paid for sub par meal and service."}
{"text":"This place is great! You get lots of excellent food for your money and the staff is awesome. Our last waitress, Jessie, was fantastic! Our drinks were never empty and our table was always clear of plates we didn't need anymore. She was very knowledgeable about the food, made great recommendations and was super sweet. 5/5!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I'm from Texas and I love this place. Obviously nowhere can compare to home but the food here comes pretty close! The rolls are to die for and the chili is made just like home---no beans! My go-to is the half rack of ribs with a loaded potato."}
{"text":"As always the bar is great for service. Am a little disappointed that they have such a high turnover of bar tenders. Some are gone and some are no longer behind the bar. Again the service has always been good. But I do like going to places and seeing the same faces behind the bar. Nice when you are always gone from home and can find a place like home."}
{"text":"Server was very impersonal and rude. The bread machine had broke so they were making the bread by scratch. We waiting until after our food came for bread and butter, but bread was up and ready several times before but the waiter kept coming over saying he made the cooks restart the bread because it wasn't good enough. Other customers were receiving the bread. I ordered the filet and shrimp meal and at the end of the meal, not everyone was completed. He asked me to hand him my plate to clear off the table, which I found odd. I handed it to him sturdily, and he purposely leaned the plate down in the front so the butter cup fell to the table splashing oil all over me, the table, and my clothes. Including my boyfriend that are now ruined. He never apologized and/or brought new napkins to clean up. All I had to use was my one cloth napkin that was already soiled from using with my meal. He charged us full price and again never apologized!   Horrible experience!!"}
{"text":"First off I want to make this VERY CLEAR! The food here is SUPERB, TWO THUMBS UP TO THE KITCHEN STAFF. Now the staff in the front is not so great. We came here to have a graduation dinner and brought a family of 13 with us. When we arrived we were told there would be a wait time of about 2 hours before we could be seated in a table that is big enough to sit all of us together. About an hour and a half in we were called up to the front because our table was available. Very hungry and eager to eat we all got up and headed towards the front. When we got there we were told that our table had just been given to another family and that we were going to have to wait some more. Extremely disappointed but still trying to make the best of the situation for our grad we decided to wait some more in hopes of getting our table. Half hour later our device started flashing meaning that a table was available for us. Here we thought yay finally! Everyones face in our family went from smiles to confusion as we approached TWO tables not one big table. I mean sure we were back to back but this was not the table or tables better said that we were promised. I understand it was very busy in the restaurant but for your staff to make us wait 2 hours to be seated, you would think they would at least get our table right. I'm very disappointed in your staff and strongly urge to be retrained in order to multi task a lot better. My overall review of this place, foods great, staff needs work."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and I'm not sure why I keep returning. Maybe because the service is usually pretty good and others I'm with want to come here. My food is always blah. But this last time it was horrible!  I got the steak and ribs. Ugh - both were so dry and overcooked. Even the baked potato was just ok and pretty dry. Salad was decent because how do your really mess up a Caesar salad. The best part of the meal was their famous bread.   Our server was a sweetheart and I'm sure if I had complained she would've taken the food off the check. But I didn't want to make a fuss because a.) I didn't feel like being that girl and b.) honestly I'm just not convinced the quality of the food is very good. Pretty sure this will be my last visit here, unless I have to attend an event like a bday party or something that requires me to come back."}
{"text":"Inconsistent. Sometimes everything is very good; sometimes the food is very salty.....often too salty to eat. If you hit it on a good day and can get a table, there's no telling which you'll get. We stopped going here because the chances of heavy- handed salting isn't worth the money."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times and each time it is either disappointing or downright awful! I am not sure what the big deal is about this place. There are so many great steak places in town and the food here is not good. Okay, the rolls are good,not great, but still, are ya gonna go to a crappy place just for the rolls?   We went again last week for a friends party. I will never step foot in this restaurant ever again after the way we were treated. We are all ex-servers and know how to treat customers. We were all horrified how rude the staff was to us. We should have gotten up and walked out to go someplace else."}
{"text":"I just want to know why are all of your locations on the west side? How about something closer to central Phoenix"}
{"text":"Madison served me. She was super nice and helpful.We got ribs and green beans And my friend got the  steak medallion with sweet potatoes.  Will be back next time I come through clt."}
{"text":"This place has the best service for such a very busy place.  Food was delivered fast and the taste is as always spot on!"}
{"text":"And it keeps getting worse. Still not impressed with Texas Roadhouse. Food was not cooked correctly again. And the service was simply awful. Again I asked for a medium steak and it came out completely rare. Not one ounce was pink, instead it was bright red and clearly not cooked to a medium preference. I had to search for our server after 15 minutes post food not checking in to send it back. When they brought it out, it wasn't hot but warm but at least it was cooked. Service and food seem to be going down hill hopefully it will get better soon. Until then, I don't plan on visiting for awhile..."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Friday night about 6:20pm. 35-45 minute wait.  6:56 seated. Kaitlyn our server.  Waters out quickly. Salads, as well.  Water was a little slow to be refilled. I was thirsty. The other two with me still had about a 1/4 glass left.   Food out within 20 minutes of ordering the steaks (6oz filet, 6oz, sirloin, and NY strip) were cooked as ordered.  Only noticeable issue was a small \"bad\" spot in my baked potato. I didn't say anything, just cut it out and ate the delicious remains.  This not a quiet, romantic dining location so if you're looking for that don't bother. Non-stop country music (which can be requested through juke box at entrance) playing with the occasional line dance. Conversations tend to run loud cause of the open atmosphere and music.  Overall a good dining experience and will return in the future.   Side note: there is a poke stop!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for steak lovers and a chain restaurant. For $20 you can get a 16oz sirloin or rib eye. Free peanuts and fresh baked bread right off the bat. If it's your birthday they put you on a saddle and the whole place says heeeee-haw for you! Nice portion for dinner salads. Kinda loving this place"}
{"text":"Called in the morning to make reservations for a party of 13, hostess stated can make reservations we have to come in. We showed up at 7pm, they said we have to wait 40 mins for a table, we waited 40 mins still no table, 2x's they said 10 more minutes when they finally called us up they wanted to split us up in different tables.  why make us wait an hour if your going to split us up?? Garcia's Restaurant was about to accommodate us in 5 mins"}
{"text":"Texas roadhouse has the best ribs in the area. I always get takeout though because the restaurant is way too loud and all the irritating singing for birthdays."}
{"text":"Good ribs, excellent catfish dinner.  VERY loud and crowded  though!"}
{"text":"Well I took my wife here to eat dinner 1 day at about 4pm.. that must be the old folks home dropped off all the old people. .. also no peanuts on the floor like the other texas road houses I've been too. What's up with that. Food was good no complaints"}
{"text":"I have always always always been a super fan of texas roadhouse! Let me start by saying that. But on this particular day at this particular restaurant location, so many things went wrong. I came for lunch with my mom and sister & to begin with I almost slipped and fell because there was spilled water by the rug as I was walking over it. Mind you, Im pregnant & all the waitress said was please be careful. I thought that was inconsiderate & they should have dried it up, I dont think they did. Once we got to our booth, we ordered fried pickles and the silverware was still wet as though they had just taken them out of the dishwasher & just threw them in the napkins. Our food was extremely salty. I had a kabob and my sister had the salmon with rice, and my mom had steak and shrimp. All very salty. The best part was that our waitress was EXTREMELY NICE & She was very patient with us. That made our day! Hopefully they keep her because people like us will come back because of her great service!"}
{"text":"Well, sad to say this was last straw for this restaurant. Not sure how they expect to stay in business. On with the review. Placed an order for pickup, arrived 20 mins later, went to cashier, gave name and paid. She asked someone to check on it, waited another 5 mins another person asked if I was waiting, asked my name and said they would check on order. Waited another 5 mins and manager(kid) came up to me to tell me one of the cashiers gave my order to another customer..lol half hearted apology and he stated that would start my order again..I stated no, give me my money back. He said he could t and I would have to talk with Anthony tomorrow. These 7 kids whom were hanging around the cashier had far more important items than my order.. training, management, work ethic, I wonder how the food would be..definitely quality control is gone. Be wary public!"}
