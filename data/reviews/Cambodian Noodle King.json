{"text":"This place is fantastic, huge variety of Cambodian food. Very inexpensive. Had the congee, it was perfect. Really nice family run restaurant. Will probably be stopping here every time I'm back in Newmarket."}
{"text":"Superb. I work in the area and have ordered take out from this place a few times. I typically get the chicken pad thai and cold spring rolls to go and each time it has been amazing. The ingredients they use are extremely fresh which, explains why this place is fully packed during lunch every day. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love it. Clean. Consistent. Friendly. Food is delicious and portions are big. Family restaurant. Very picky eater and cant get enough. Come basically once a week."}
{"text":"Definitely not a 4 stars on yelp. The food here was ok. I do not recommend this restaurant and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"An interesting family run restaurant where it seems the whole family pitches in and family friends drop by and have loud conversations. 

The food is very good. We ordered mixed grilled meats appetizer platter with grilled chicken, sausage and pork slices, chicken pad Thai and a noodle soup with mystery meats (I am sure it was kidney and something else... I just pretend I was eating chicken). 

This place is well worth visiting, with good fresh food and supporting a small family business."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Newmarket. At the back of an industrial looking plaza off pony drive, you wouldn't stumble upon this place easily. 

It has all the typical Cambodian style dishes, making up a fusion of Thai, Chinese, and tropical style dishes. My favourite is the pad Thai as it has a good texture to the noodles and has a nice amount of spice, or no spice at all if preferred!

I've had the Avocado milkshake before which was very very tasty !! Also a favourite of mine are spring rolls and hot&Sour soup, although I do find the soup to be a bit too strong on the shiitake flavor.

I have tried their pho but I do admit it's more of a light chicken broth, which I'm not really a fan of. I wouldn't get the pho here unless you're looking for something warm.

I also recommend the fried rice and curry dishes, they are lovely!!"}
{"text":"Pho lacked some of the flavour of a richly built stock. Wait staff was great and friendly!"}
{"text":"This is a noodle shop tucked away in the northern end of Newmarket in the industrial area. 
I would describe the dishes tasting like vietnamese noodle soups with a lighter taste in the noodle broth.

I ordered their Cambodian Speciality Noodle Soup - that included ground pork, pork liver, pork fishball and pork slices. I enjoyed it greatly and the broth was very light but flavourful. 

I also ordered their deep fried spring rolls (which were delicious and the filling was very different that what other places put in their rolls). I also ordered the fresh rolls which were also very good. The vegetables were crispy and the shrimp and sauces that was included blended together very well.

The prices are also very reasonable around $8 for the noodles and $5 for the spring rolls. 

This place is run by a family and there is limited staff. People who come here are usually regulars and know to go into the kitchen to find the owners/workers. If you stop by notice there isn't much service, don't be alarmed - grab a seat and enjoy the food :)"}
{"text":"On my way here, I was quite skeptical because the place was located in a shady industrial area. My wife and I were greeted by an elderly gentleman, most likely the owner's father. He was a polite and respectful man. As soon as he seated us, he handed us the menu and brought tea over. I could not get over the quality of service as many places oftentimes overlook their customers, which doesn't sit well with some.

I ordered the beef stew noodle soup and the Mrs ordered the pad thai. We were one step away from heaven, I kid you not. The soup was SO delicious, I completely forgot about my wife. Every spoon of broth was like an orchestra - a blast of flavour in all corners of my mouth. The beef was also extremely tender, borderline melted in my mouth. You would think the beef would be rough as it's being cooked in the soup, but I guarantee that won't be the case. There was a good portion of fat in the meat, which made it even more delicious! I'm totally drooling as I'm typing this..

The pad thai was also something to rave about. It wasn't overcooked, so the noodle was still tender and chewy. Many places typically cook the noodles for too long and they get soft and soggy because of the steam. This won't be a problem here as the noodles were dry enough but still maintained the tender chewy goodness!

Both meals were generous in their portions, but that very much varies between people. I wasn't full after the noodle soup but was just right. The pad thai, however, was quite the size. I would've probably hit comatose state had I finished that myself. Thankfully I'm usually the trash can, finishing my wife's orders LOL

I'm glad Cherrie T. mentioned this place because I would've been missing out! Real talk - you cannot go wrong when service, food and portions are perfectly matched! 5/5 stars.. so until next time!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place!
Loved their pad thai! Tried it mild and spicy. They sure know what they're doing when it comes to noodles!

Give them a try- they won't disappoint!

The chicken balls were excellent."}
{"text":"Don't expect to order sweet and sour anything. This place is a bit more authentic than the average Canuck might like.   It's also tucked away off Davis Drive and off Harry Walker so the only way to find it is to look behind the hotel. 

The noodle dishes are great, and the Pad Thai is less sweet and more interesting than usual. Portions can be a bit on the small side, but so is the dining room. 

I have been back a few times so far, and this won't be the last time. It has room to grow on me, and so does the rating. 

Let me be clear: this food tastes much better than Mandarin, but is less mainstream than the late Chitose. Newmarket is so desolate in the \"good Chinese food\" category that Cambodian Noodle King is my go to when I can't justify a drive to Markham."}
{"text":"Still the best Chicken Pad Thai I've had.  Hands down! Everything authentic from old family recipes. Try the Hot and Sour Soup also.....its the bomb! Excellent service!"}
{"text":"If you've ever been to Cambodia, you will know the differences between a Vietnamese Pho and a Cambodian noodle soup.  The light body of a Cambodian soup is one key difference. This family run business is very popular for Cambodian residents in the area, such as my family members, who took me here on a cold fall day. 

The soups were light, and you can really taste the ground chicken, herbs, and sweetness of the saut√©ed garlic oils.  It's actually very hard to achieve a broth this light and yet complex in flavor.  Sometimes people get to heavy handed with their salt, or use a soup base.  This broth I was told was made from scratch, as was all of our in house spring rolls.  Make sure you get your Chinese long doughnuts as well when you order these, love the crunchiness of them when they come out of the fryer... low calorie?  These are not!
 
Only wished that they had more authentic cambodian dishes on there, like the curries made of tumeric, beef, and chinese eggplant. Or the great fish dishes sold in Cambodian markets...delish!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to find out Newmarket had a new noodle restaurant and was eager to try it.  I ordered a pad Thai and a hot and sour soup, I figure these basic food should give me a baseline for a restaurant of this type.

I wasn't a fan of the soup and the pad Thai was average at best.  I paid $18 and change for the experience and won't be back' there are much better options in the area for more reasonable prices.  Too bad.."}
{"text":"I went here for the 1st time today. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and added the saffron sauce they provide. It was delicious! I asked for spicy and it was just the right amount of spice. My husband ordered the Beef Stew Noodle soup. It was also delicious and filling. Restaurant was clean and staff very friendly. Price was very reasonable! Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I had the beef vermicelli and it was delicious. The spring rolls were great. Definitely would go back again. It's hard to find healthy authentic food."}
{"text":"I have moved to Aurora for a year, and I CANNOT believe I did not discover this noodle house any sooner! Cambodian Noodle King was recommended by Chef Heather who lives in Aurora for over 30 years, and she has been a loyal customer ever since she found out about this hole in the wall. How can I pass up on this opportunity to explore good food? lol. I made it my mission to visit the next morning for brunch!

This family owned restaurant is completely tucked away in a plaza of an industrial area, NE of Leslie Street / Davis Drive. The family working there is absolutely friendly and attentive. They can also speak a bit of Cantonese. Love the grandpa, he is so adorable ^^ The family often checks up on the customers. The chef in the kitchen also comes out to make sure the food is delicious and up to par.

All the noodles they use are Cambodian style noodles; it is very different from pho noodles. The noodles are light, thin and chewy, similar to glass noodles! I would much prefer this over pho now hahaha... sorry pho!

Highly recommend the Pad Thai - this dish has a serious kick to it but spicy good. #18 Beef stew with noodles in a beef broth - definitely a must for beef lovers. #22 House special with noodles is my personal favourite - especially delicious with that garlicky soup base!

This noodle house is now my new favourite spot for noodle cravings! Hope you guys can also give them a try if you're in the area :) Keep up the great work, Cambodian Noodle King! #supportlocalbusiness"}
{"text":"The food is incredibly good, and  reminded me of my mom homemade food whom I never seen in 10 years. The setting is old styles; could've improved. Overall, the food is authentic and great service."}
{"text":"Stop by here today while visiting Canada. The store was located across the street from my hotel. The Yelp reviewers hyped me up to thinking the food was awesome. The people that own the place was super nice. I received my order in a good timely matter but that's where the good talking stops. The food tasted over cooked and bland absolutely no seasoning at all then I order a few fresh spring rolls and got back to my hotel and found there was no peanut sauce...that's the icing on the cake with a cherry on top. Bottom line I was not impressed and will not be returning"}
