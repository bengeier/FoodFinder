{"text":"The food was good and our waiter was very helpful in explaining the various dishes. He sounded like someone who really knew his stuff. We had the recommended special surf and turf which is steak and large tiger shrimp. The shrimp was absolutely delicious, the steak was good but nothing exceptional. We also had an appetizer the name of which I forget but which had very generous portions. Overall it was a good experience. 
We went on our way back from a trip to Hamilton, and if a similar came up again I would go again."}
{"text":"So-so Italian spot with little flair. Not bad but absolutely no reason to go back."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner on Saturday night on the patio. The service was very good, very attentive staff. The food was really good, we started of with the calamari which the server recomended, it was really good and fresh. For dinner we had the surf/turf and it was really tasty, the biggest shrip I've ever seen. 
Great place, will be coming back!"}
