{"text":"A new place on the island, Bananier enticed me with their cool decor, and so hubby and I stopped by for dinner tonight. Upon a quick look at the menu it was clear that the prices here were a bit on the high side (ex. an appetizer side salad for $9). We decided to try the mango shrimp salad to share, the red curry beef for me, and the duck for the hub. The food came out quickly, and although the salad was good it was definitely nothing to write home about.

I was looking forward to my curry and was really disappointed when it literally had zero flavour. Having had great curries around the city, I was expecting to be met with this warm, all encompassing deliciousness but instead was bored with the tastelessness of the whole dish.

Hubby's duck was ok but nothing special.

Overall, ended up spending about $70 for the above, and left feeling very unsatisfied.. won't be back :("}
{"text":"This place is amazing.   My wife is from
Montreal and every time we come we try out a new restaurant.  Bananier offer a fresh taste in Thai crusine.  There's plenty of flavor and spices in the food.  We got the grill ocotopus and satay beef as appetizer.  Our entree was the fried red snapper with tamarind sauce.  We couldn't get any appetizer because they have very generous portion.  The fish was fried perfectly and the sauce complemented greatly with the fish.  Also, I recommend their lemonade drink.  I ordered Bombay with lemonade and their house lemonade was delicious.  Great place to bring a date or a family dinner.  The ambience is lovely.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Bananier scored somewhere around 3.5 stars. Ambiance and service are amazing. The personnel is extremely attentive and accommodating. The decor is elegant. Small and relatively big groups of people can be easily accommodated. The food unfortunately was a little bit disappointing and somehow pricey. Definitely fan of the Tom Yam soup with coconut water. We also had the green papaya salad with home made jerky and the steamed dumplings with shrimp, and leek for starters. I wish both dishes were a little bit spicier, the dumplings were nice, but I couldn't quite well taste the leek and shrimp, may be the peanut butter sauce dominated the overall taste. The mains were merely disappointing, I like the curry creamy, unfortunately the green curry with galanga and eggplant was not exactly what I have imagined, may be I did not like very much the fried tofu in the vegetarian choice. The chicken with cashew nuts was not up to our liking either. In the end I think Bananier should work a little bit more on the food authenticity. I want this restaurant to succeed and upon another occasion I would give it a second chance, but I'm not in a rush yet."}
