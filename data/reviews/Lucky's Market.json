{"text":"Lucky's is amazing! It's as if Aldi and Whole Foods had a beautiful love child.   Lucky's offers fresh produce at an affordable cost as well as some great grocery items. I have had the ability to try their fresh bakery items, handmade pizza, house made sandwiches, and hand rolled sushi. All of these in house items are top notch! I definitely recommend trying their 2 slice + pint of beer option for only $5!   In addition, Lucky's gives back to the community which I adore. If you bring in your own bag, you have the ability to save 10¢ on your next order or donate that 10¢ by using a fun token and choosing one of their three local nonprofits. I was also informed by an employee that once a month or so they choose a local nonprofit and donate 10% of their profits to that nonprofit! I love that they give back in this way.   The place is incredibly packed and the only downside is space filling up in the parking lot quickly. I love Lucky's and have had nothing but good experience with the staff!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying... I am honestly SO impressed by this store! Every. Little. Detail. From the $2 pints and $3 wine while you walk through the store, to the endless options of fun organic, vegan and vegetarian options, to the fresh and reasonably priced produce (77 cent pineapples guys!) and the friendly staff.   But, I have to say, I think the best part are the bag donations. So, I am trying to get more into bringing my own bags. Well, at Lucky's, they encourage that too. For each bag (or at least one) you are charged 10 cents. You are given the option, if you bring your own bags, to either remove the bag fee, or to donate it to a number of charities. If you choose to donate, Lucky's will match your 10 cent donation. They then give you a coin to drop into this fun little maze thing (reminded me of the ones from museums!) leading to your charity of choice. How awesome is that?   I am hoping the place cools down a bit after the grand opening, but I will definitely be back to shop in the future. Positive words are traveling fast about this store and I am so excited to see what it brings for the Lakewood community."}
{"text":"This place is superb  We strolled I'm on their opening day and found it packed, but the lines were not long, apparently they flew up experiences cashiers from all over the country to help keep the place cool, calm and collected for their grand opening.   First thing I noticed? The prices! I asked a gentleman right away, \"are these just opening week prices?\" He said this is Whole Foods kinda food but half the price\". He wasn't lying, 77¢ pineapples, Blueberry pints 2 for $3, $1 bell peppers, tons of prepared food for 1 & 2 people. They had an Asian counter with fresh ramen and sushi, one of the best looking fresh meat displays I've seen in a while and tons of other goodies.   we downloaded their app and got $5 odd $25. We packed a small cart and walked out either a $36.00 bill. we WILL be back. SO happy to finally have a nice grocery store within walking distance!"}
{"text":"Awesome grocery store.  Products can compete with Whole Foods...and other unusual finds.  Great \"bulk\" Foods section.  Great meat department...a lot of nice things for a good cookout.  Also great bakery and prepared foods.  My kids really enjoy the pizza you take home and cook.  A lot of employees that are happy to help.  Lost some stars for a TERRIBLE parking lot.  Very small and chaotic.  By no means meets the parking needs for this store.  The store is very crowded.  I am really hoping this is because it is a new store and will level out because the atmosphere there alone is enough to make me think twice about returning.  Will probably go back after a while to see if things there less chaotic."}
{"text":"Just returned home with a lovely baseball cut top sirloin and some in house seasoned bacon to wrap it in! What a excellent shopping experience! Whole Foods has some serious competition. They have bags that they give you, and when you bring them back, you can choose a charity that they will donate too. All the food was super fresh and looked great. From twice baked potatoes to ramen noodle bowls. I absolutely recommend this place! What a great addition to our community."}
{"text":"The cons here are that the layout is a bit cramped (especially peak shopping hours) and the parking situation is less than ideal. Produce has been good, not great. Otherwise, this is a great market to have nearby, an excellent alternative to the other grocery stores nearby. Love the $2 draft beers, friendly staff, bulk bins (trail mix, candy, dried fruit, lentils, etc). As with all grocery stores, certain full-price items are overpriced, so check the website for what's on sale every week. Great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful shopping trip. I drove from Wayne Co to check store out and was NOT disappointed. Fresh orange juice. Affordable produce and that hottie Jason from channel 19 was there too. The store was packed but there was still room to roam. Surprisingly, with all of the shoppers, the store was clean. Food was fresh. Wine and beer in real glasses and the staff was immediate when a question needed to be answered. Our check out person was so great. I'm going back."}
{"text":"Very nice and clean store. Bright and cheerful on the inside. Wine selection was very good. The meat/deli section looked great. I knocked it down because of the layout of the meat area. My wife has anaphylaxis with shellfish aka she could die. Their shellfish case is right next to their meat case. I watched the employees weigh shellfish and meat on the same scales without cleaning them and without changing their gloves. Unfortunately this is the type of thing that could cause a reaction in my wife. Most grocery stores keep their cases separate. This was very disappointing to us. We won't be getting anything from here other than wine"}
{"text":"The Ramen bowl station inside the market was very adequate with the pricing and selection for a grocery store. I will return for other soups and meats for the Reman. I enjoyed the spice level. The seating was next to  the beer coolers (chilly).  Overall 7.9/10  The Hot cookie was delicious at the coffee shop inside the store."}
{"text":"Parking is inasane . Good luck . The food deli in the back looks legit . It's a good idea and Lakewood needed something like this sonits cool ."}
{"text":"I went on opening day to this market.  First off.  I'll be back.  The prices are very reasonable.  I bought a whole bag of stuff and only paid $11. For healthy food.  Come on.  Can't beat that. Downside of opening day.  The crowd. But that's to be expected.  I am not a Hipster.  Ive never seen so many Hipsters and wannabe hipsters in one place.  It was comical.  Lol.  For health conscious people. This is the place to shop. They have virtually everything. From dairy free and no gluten to vegetarians and vegans.  You should be able to find what you are looking for here.   It also is in a very nice section of Cleveland.  Get out of your house and get here."}
{"text":"Having been a fan of Lucky's Market after visiting their Columbus location was thrilled and excited to see them come to NE Ohio.  They cater to a fresh healthy lifestyle with abundant produce. The prepared foods section was chock full of delicious choices.  Frozen foods had a great selection of unfamiliar new brands to try. Salad bar, fresh soups and olive bars were all well stocked and clean.  Wine choices were good, and gentleman working the wine aisle was helpful. Shopping with a glass of wine will cost you a mere $3. How's that for adding fun to your shopping experience.  Memorial Day added to the already newly open crowd, but help was always available to assist and most things were easy to find.  I can't wait to return and try more."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the crazy good deals on rock crab claws and Mahi Mahi fish. It was the worst quality fish and crab I've ever had. Tasted as freezer burn or thawed and frozen several times before it got to the market. I was really excited about this place but was extremely disappointed. The plus side is my dog loved the fish."}
{"text":"Lucky's Market----Welcome to the neighborhood!  We are so excited to have you here. It was my first visit this evening during Lucky's soft opening and the store was buzzing. I was very impressed with everything I saw there----the produce looked great and there were some very attractive prices attached. I covered most of the aisles and loved the variety. Bought a few ready made items for dinner and all passed the taste test with high marks. My favorite ready made item was the spring peas with couscous. Who knew couscous could taste like this! I will return soon and wish them well! Check the store out,  you won't regret it. Really friendly staff too."}
{"text":"OMG!!! YES, YES, YES.  I drove by here yesterday evening (on 5/15/2018) and noticed that Lucky's Market is now open so I quickly stopped in. I was legit so happy when I walked in because the inside was so clean and everything looked and smelled so fresh. What is super cool about Lucky's is that 10% of what your purchase goes back into the community.   I had never heard about Lucky's before until I saw them building the store a few months ago. I'm so glad I was able to peek in during their soft opening. The official GRAND OPENING is today (Wednesday, 16 May 2018) so stop on in because there are plenty of sales.   This is the 2nd Lucky's Market in Ohio. The first is in Columbus. There are also several locations across the U.S. Lucky's is a cross between Whole Foods and Aldi. Cheaper than Whole Foods and a bit more expensive than Aldi. The quality of their products here at Lucky's is excellent. They have mostly (if not ALL) organic produce, meats, snacks, skincare products (deodorant, body oil, etc), prepared foods, etc. The options here are endless.   While here, I bought 2 packs of frozen fruits, prepared dinner to go (pork potstickers), spinach, chocolate, natural deodorant, natural gum, and plantain chips. The pork potstickers was delicious especially dipped with the sauce it came with. The sauce was too oily though so I recommend not using too much sauce.   Overall, I had an awesome experience here and I will be DEFINITELY be back.   *** This is my 99th Yelp review overall.  53rd review for 2018. I am aiming for 60 reviews in 2018 but I think I can get 100 reviews."}
{"text":"Simply put, we're lucky to have Lucky's in Lakewood.   I docked a star because the store is a bit cramped, the parking lot here is a disaster, and the coffee bar is quite the disappointment (thankfully Starbucks is across the street).  Those things aside, Lucky's is great. Fresh produce, beautiful open atmosphere, great customer service, and quality range of products. For those of us near the lake, it's great not having to trek far for groceries or quick eats.  If you can, do yourself a favor and walk or at least come at off-peak hours. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is great. Me my wife and daughter all went there. It was there grand opening weekend. They have a great kitchen area, you can order cooked good to go such as pizza pre made foods. There is a ramen and sushi bar that we got a great california roll and a spring roll.. They also have a full serve bar that you can order wine and beer from which is amazing whem shopping lol.. The prices were great, obviously a grand opening special $0.79 pineapple, $0.89 cantalope. And all other types of produce for under a dollar. All types of organic but alot cheaper than trader joes.. great place.  Good luck stay busy and we will be back again."}
{"text":"I am beyond excited that this has moved into Lakewood. Especially the fact that they are located on this side of Lakewood. I used to live over here and always hated the lack of a good grocery store. I would say luckys is similar to aldis with pricing or as someone put it a \"cheaper whole foods\" The store looks absolutely amazing. Great prices, fresh produce, great prices on organic products, delicious prepared foods, great deals on wine ( 3 for $12!) and to top it off they have beer for $2 and wine for $3 that you can drink while you shop! And we are talking about crappy beer here folks. You can get a fatheads beer for $2!!! I told my boyfriend this might have to be a new date night place! We also purchased some swordfish here for only 9.99 a lb and I can't wait to marinate those babies and throw them on the grill. Please check this place out and spread the word!"}
{"text":"What an amazing addition to the Lakewood/Cleveland area! First off, you can buy a pint or glass of wine to drink while you grocery shop.....where has this been my entire adult life???   Their food selections are great. We walked through and just got some \"essentials\" to sample. A steak from their deli counter, French baguette, cherry turnover, two sub sandwiches, sushi, fresh mozzarella, watermelon water, and of course empanadas. Everything was fresh and tasty. And even though the store was PACKED, they were appropriately staffed and it was still pretty easy to get in and out.   I can't wait to do some legit grocery shopping here. Make sure you download their app, their coupons are very worthwhile!!"}
{"text":"The place was awful to maneuver around in with a cart. The aisle around produce and everywhere for that matter, you couldn't keep from running into someone you can't stop to look at anything or you hold up other people around you.  It looked nice for selection but I couldn't stop to see anything. Someone had knocked over a blueberry stand that's how close everything is to each other. I was so disappointed at the selection for kids medicine. Maybe if you go shopping at 9pm at night it won't be crowded."}
{"text":"I want so much to mention all the wonderful things about this grocery store, and I will, but firstly I have to mention that this was one of the most stressful trips to the grocery store in my recent experience. I actually was really looking forward to visiting Lucky's. I had heard tons of good things from people in the neighborhood, and given that I'm somewhat of a grocery store nerd, I couldn't wait to check it out. I saw a lot of complaints about the parking situation beforehand, but I didn't have a huge issue on my visit. It's likely that you'll have to wait a couple minutes for a spot to open in the adjoining lot, but honestly I find that's most often the case for all grocery stores during peak shopping times. After entering though, I could tell immediately that getting around the actual store was going to be an issue. The shopping lanes are really, really close together. To be honest, 2 carts in the same aisle can barely get past each other. In addition, there's not a lot of logic in my mind to how the lanes are sorted, which isn't a big deal, but what's annoying is the setup of the store. Most of the areas where folks have to line up to purchase (deli counter, ready made foods, prepared foods, coffee bar) are also in the path of people trying to get in and around aisles, so there are bottlenecks happening everywhere you turn. Not to mention people walking around with pints of beer as if you're grocery shopping at a street festival. I honestly don't think there's a single place in this grocery store where you could stand and not be in someone's way. I also grew incredibly frustrated after waiting almost 10 minutes at the deli counter (no numbering system even on a busy Saturday) and when I was called up to the counter thinking I was next, the gentleman told me he could only help if I needed prepared foods because there was a backup on the slicers for deli meats. There were only 3 people ahead of me, which seems a little ridiculous that the slicers were \"backed up\" with only that many people. I walked away without my lunchmeat and headed over (very, very slowly because again, traffic is an issue) to the produce. I was dismayed to find that most of the staples I had come for such as garlic, kale and cilantro were completely sold out. I did ask the gentleman working in the produce section about the issue, and he was kind enough, but basically they were understocked for the amount of customers it seems. I ended up leaving getting only half of what I needed, and I didn't feel the prices were as much of a \"deal\" as they want you to think it is. There were some decent deals on Lucky's branded products, but it wouldn't be enough to make me want to endure the stress of visiting this grocery store again. In addition, knowing that stock is an issue, I'd much rather go to a different grocery store where I know I won't experience that.   All that being said, I did promise I'd mention the good, and I think there are some perks to this grocer. Firstly, is obvious: the location is a benefit. There aren't a lot of decent groceries in this part of Lakewood, and Lucky's definitely fills a gap in that way, thus the likely reason why it's so busy. The second is I LOVE the idea of their grocery bag discount/donation program. I always bring my reusable grocery bags when I shop, but who doesn't love a little extra incentive? At Lucky's, you can get either $.10 off your bill, or you can turn that $.10 into tokens to be donated to one of three local nonprofits of your choosing. Little incentive programs like these are far more valuable to me as a shopper that the ability to drink beer while I shop...but to each his own. Lastly, I will say I did like their bulk section. They had spices, grains, nuts and candy in bulk, and an easy weighing machine. It's nice to know I can bring sustainable containers to a place like this and stock up on pantry items.  Overall, I think Lucky's does fill a much needed gap in Lakewood, I just wish they would have thought of the user experience in a more practical manner, rather than just focusing on the \"bells and whistles\" to get customers in the door. Hopefully after a few months, the mad rush will slow down and things will become more systematic, but after my stressful visit, I definitely won't be returning anytime in the near future."}
