Service: questionable, server seemed untrained and uncertain of how to do the job

Food: acceptable, but the menu was oddly limited and had nothing in the way of sandwiches or other medium-sized meals

Pricing: not totally out of line, but a little high for what you get"}
{"text":"Seriously, we had reservations for 6:00 pm. We showed up at 6:05 pm and were told our table was given away. Don't make reservations there since they don't honor it."}
{"text":"We've been here three times now, but apparently the place is under new management since our last visit. We always go before a show and have twice eaten at the bar, getting reasonable service and OK food. 

Today, again before a show, the service was very bad and the food only mediocre. My husband never got the soup he ordered and I got a sandwich different than I had ordered. The waiter never checked on us after food was delivered and the soup was on the bill anyhow. The bill was not fixed correctly, even after the error was pointed out. This might be our last visit to the Grille on Seventh."}
{"text":"Wake up Pittsburgh! Get over to the Grille on 7th. Chef Michael is doing some great things with the menu. The Buffalo Chicken Wrap is to die for."}
{"text":"Great place to go before or show downtown. Amazing manager is a one man show who will accomodate to any request . So if your looking for a nice place to go before a show with good food and great service I would reccommend the grille on seventh"}
{"text":"We came for a nice lunch on a sunny day 2 wks ago, and it was good! I didn't expect out-of-this-world food. It's American food, so it's not going to be great. My bf got the hot pastrami sandwhich, and he loved it even though he had to ask pickles for it to suite his taste buds. I ordered some portobella sandwich and it was ok but when I make my own I usually like it a little more grilled so it's less watery. My bun was a bit soggy. The fries were not bad either. It's just an OK place! Not bad and not great!"}
{"text":"I'm not a complainer, but this was literally the worst restaurant I've ever been to in my life.

The first problem was that the restaurant was severely understaffed.  For a location so close to the convention center, it did not make sense for them to be unprepared for large crowds during the lunch hour.  After my group of three placed orders, it took about 45 minutes for the food to arrive.  For fine dining, this is perfectly acceptable, but it did not make sense for this kind of restaurant.  (I should also mention that we were actually ahead of the lunch rush.)

I was patient enough that I did not mind the wait too much.  The food, however, was rather horrifying.  I ordered an appetizer that was supposed to be pita with three dips (spinach, pepper hummus, and something with seafood).  They gave us about seven small pieces of pita and filled the rest with stale tortilla chips, and the seafood dip mysteriously never arrived.

The worst part--and I have never seen this before--was that 25% of my fish entree was literally burned to a pitch black crisp.  If I had more time, I would have sent it straight back to the kitchen (and I never send anything back to the kitchen).  But for all I know, I would have had to wait another 45 minutes.

On the way out, I knew the waiter would never get to our bill at the table, so I spent 10 minutes waiting in line to pay at the counter instead."}
{"text":"This place went way out of their way to accommodate me.  I had 25 mins and 3 different people working  said no problem we will make it .  I sat at the bat and the bartender was busy so the chef (owner I believe) helped her and the other owner took my order.  Great experience.  They aim to please.   

Put it this way.  This is likely my only yelp post ever.  I don't do this.   Good people great service.   ...if the food is no good I'll be suprised.  They are taking the time to make this place work."}
{"text":"Horrible. Do not eat here, for your health. First off we received 2 menus which made ordering very confusing. We were told to order the stuffed burgers because that is what they were known for. We ordered some drinks, the selection was pretty basic. And we waited, and waited, and waited for the food to come out. Finally it arrived and that is when it really went bad. Two of the three stuffed burgers came out and the bacon was WHITE, NOT COOKED. Then, I noticed that my burger wasn't even stuffed so I sent the whole thing back. Waited and waited for it to come back, ended up the burger itself was delicious, but still hardly any trace of cheese still to make it seem stuffed. We had one more person who ordered Salmon. Her whole plate was cold so she sent it back completely did not even want to chance it again. The manager was nowhere to be found and only took 3 beers off the tab. Terrible service just do yourself a favor and stay far away. Many other places around just don't go"}
{"text":"The fact that this place was dead on a Friday night pre-curtain should have been a clue; the spelling errors in the menu should have been my cue to walk out of this place; and the prices?  FUGGITTABOUTIT!  The food was bad.  The atmosphere depressing. The service lackluster.  The prices high for what you get.  There are too many good eateries in the theatre district to waste your money on this one.  The only saving grace was the fact that my strip steak was actually cooked the way I asked it to be prepared.  That is the only thing good about this place.  STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch after seeing a Sunday matinee show at the Byham, and striking out at Six Penn Kitchen and Meat & Potatoes, both of which had a lengthy wait. It should have been a warning sign that the Grille on Seventh could seat our party of 7 immediately, but we decided to give it a try anyway, since the kids where getting tired of walking.

Initially things looked positive, with friendly staff and an attentive waitress.  Things started to go downhill when the drinks arrived; the soda fountain was a little off (flat), but we figured that can happen anywhere.  When our order arrived, the sandwiches and salads were sub-par but edible.  The real kicker was when we got the check: $90 for four adults and three kids.  Turns out that the kids meals were NINE DOLLARS each, the same price as an adult sandwich!  They don't have a printed children's menu, so the waitress just listed the options, with no mention of the price -- and now we know why.

There are plenty of other options in the Cultural District, and we'll be looking elsewhere the next time we want to grab a quick bite before or after a show...Someplace that doesn't charge an arm and a leg for a greasy grilled cheese sandwich and soggy fries."}
{"text":"Awful. Dirty and dingy. Ice cold food. Meager portions. My husband ordered sirloin steak and got one slice of meat, coldashed potatoes, on a bed of wilted lettuce. I had six tiny ice cold shrimp with ice cold mashed potatoes on a bed of wilted lettuce.  Filthy bathroom. Filthy carpet. No wine list. Do not go here ever !!"}
{"text":"I always have higher hopes for this place...it is often forgotten among my lunch crew as a mid-priced-sandwich-salad-easy lunch place.

And then I remember why - the food is so forgettable and meh.  (the title for 2 stars is soooo appropriate)

Average salads and sandwiches.  All are fine.  There is ample seating available downstairs, so getting a table during lunch is never a problem.  They appear to have a decent beer selection - although I have never been there for happy hour.  I believe the layout would limit my enjoyment of a happy hour occasion.

I'll go back, when I am looking for a vanilla, safe, non-offensive lunch choice where I know I'll have no wait for lunch.  Otherwise...there are other places I would head to first."}
{"text":"The wait staff was exceptional.  They were joyful, nice, and a pleasure to talk with, but that was the only thing this place had going for it.

I use to come here for lunch when my office was previously in town on a regular basis when I wasn't sure what I wanted to eat.  They had a rather large nondescript menu that had many decent options on it.

This time the menu was small and condensed, but severely lacked a theme or tone to it.  I ordered a quesadilla that looked delicious, but may have been the worst thing I ever eaten.  The chef should be fired because there is no doubt the chicken was over cooked originally, left out for too long, and then reheated for my meal. Terrible...terrible...terrible

If you're one of the owners reading this please train your staff.  Like I started this review, their personalities are fantastic, but need just a little training.  Saw too many people complaining about receiving their check and just not having enough attention being paid to them as customers.


Oh and as I look at the pictures below the kitchen forgot my salsa...how do you forget the salsa with a quesadilla."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ever posted about a restaurant, so you know it was bad. Not only did we not have menus, and were asked twenty minutes later if we were ready to order, but they also did not give us silverware for the entire table (just the one rollup that was already on the table). The table wobbled back and forth and they did not bother to wipe the tables down for the next customer. Also, They decided to wait til halfway through our meal when our glasses had been empty to fill up. The food took forever and both the appetizers and dishes were left on the table. Then we had to wait for our bill, which eventually we just went up to the bar and asked for it. When we brought up the bad service to the manager he scoffed at the comment like it was beyond him to care. The food was fair to poor as well. Certainly not a place I would go again."}
{"text":"Poor Poor Poor!!!!  Had a 6pm reservation... .finally received SALADS (ordered as our dinner) at 7:05!  Salad was tasty however.... management was extremely poor.  I complained about the time/delay as we had theater tickets... Manager said he'd review the bill.  Total of bill was $78.00.... he was so very sorry that he took $6.40!  He said he was authorized to take 10%..... his math skills are clearly equivalent to his management skills.  

So many fantastic choices downtown, DO NOT waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Never again!  I am new to downtown Pgh, was craving a burger and walked outside my building looking for a place that wasn't fast food but where I could get a good burger to go.  Grille on Seventh was a short walk away, looked nice, outdoor seating area filled with other professionals out on their lunch break so I gave it a try.  Was greeted right away, sat at the bar and ordered a cheeseburger medium to go.  This was at 11:55.   

My order didn't come out until 12:40, and I was in there before the big lunch crowd walked in.  Further, when I asked for mustard, I was told \"we don't have any\".  Really, in a burger/bar restaurant, there's no mustard?  I asked if they were going to charge me for a 45 min wait on my burger and they did not, which was the only thing they could do I think.  The bartender was real apologetic.  When I got back to my office to eat the burger, however, I discovered they didn't give me any silverware or napkins AND the burger was still pretty raw in the middle.  Never again."}
{"text":"Overpriced and simple. Place didn't look like it was open. Soup was basic and they had to alter because they didn't have certain ingredients. My pasta primavera was a 19.99 lunch item and I was expecting it to be awesome. However, when received, it was essentially boiled spaghetti in a butter sauce with very few vegetables. The service was okay, not great. This place needs Marcus Lemonis otherwise its either a front or its doomed. 

Do yourself a favor and go to Meat and Potatoes!"}
{"text":"After dinner on Liberty, me and the H wanted to stop somewhere to get a drink that was close to the Benedum as we were seeing a show last night, and perhaps a place that didn't charge an arm and a leg for a drink.  Well one out of two ain't bad right?

I'll start by saying, the bartender was a really nice guy.  Friendly, accommodating, and let me explain why he was accommodating.  They have about meh 15 or so beers on tap.  I say oh I will, let me stop you there... Just because I appear to have beer I do not... ALL of the taps were down, and here is the killer... I say oh did that just happen?  Answer:  No been this way since Sunday.... It is Tuesday night??? What the heck are they doing?  I just hope they don't try to serve that skunky beer when and if the tap system gets repaired... I am sure that was a big loss so what is all the wait about?  

Well we decided to stay tempted with a bottled beer but I felt like they were a little overpriced, even though I think he charged us less than normal because the draft situation, so we had a couple and left for the Theater.

I probably wouldn't return, but I give the bartender an A+.  Another patron left and forgot her hat.  We pointed it out to the bartender thinking he would put it behind the bar for her to pick up later when she realized she forgot it.  NOPE, this man bolted out of the place sprinting down 7th to return this hat back to its owner without putting so much as a coat on to protect himself from the icy cold lingering outside... Super great bartender, I believe his name was Brook.  Well If I would ever come back I would hope he would be waiting on me."}
{"text":"ONE & DONE. No thank you very much. I won't be back. 

Once I entered the bar I made up the third person that was dining/drinking in the entire place.

The prep cook who was hanging around the bar area was kind enough to tell me that the kitchen was closed! it was 7:30pm.  Curiously enough when 4 more people stumbled in (10 minutes later) the owner offered them menus and was even kind enough to tell those other patrons what the restaurant was out of.  

*pats self on back, It's a good thing that I had already eaten dinner at Spice Island Tea House and consumed the equivalent of two bottles of champagne while there.  I only came in here to use the rest room and took pity on this sorry ass bar. So that's why I sat down to have a drink. 

No one likes to be told they can't have something they don't want.  I am thinking that the cook just didn't want to make food at the moment.  This place is a laughing shame and I heard another staff member yelling across the bar about the rules and regulations of the half way house she lives at. 


Wow I was would expect better etiquette from the staff of place that serves $8 dollar glasses of Riesling I SHOULD HAVE JUST GONE TO SONOMA GRILLE!!! 

Seriously though wine prices are comparable to what you can get at the Sonoma Grille and that place is 1,000,000,000.00  times nicer than this dump. 

Wow  I wonder if your low brow staff has anything to do with the fact that your bar sucks mmmh???"}
{"text":"Service:rude,even hostile.  Food: Applebee's level.  Price-expensive.  No locals hang out here.  \"Roasted beet salad\" 'was greens from a bag with sliced canned pickled beets."}
{"text":"I stopped in very quickly on my way to see a show at the Benedum for a quick drink.  The weather was nice so we sat outside in the patio.  It was beautiful!  We ordered a few appetizers which were delicious and our drinks came quick!  The waiter was very nice, even though we were in a bit of a rush!  I would love to go and sit for a meal when I have more time!!"}
{"text":"Great location, and wonderful staff, but I think the prices are out of line, both for food and drinks.  

This place gets packed when there is a big event at the Benedum, but I know we have better options Downtown."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place!

What an abysmal experience. These people have no clue about customer service. I just went there with 6 other friends and thought I would share some facts with you:

+ We asked if we could split the check among 7. The server made a face and said something like \"Seriously? Seven? I guess.\" A simple yes or no would have been enough.
+ We asked about the sandwiches and burgers they were advertising outside the restaurant. We were told that was from the lunch menu and we couldn't have them. Two girls walked in about an hour later and got a burger and a sandwich each. The girls told us the server said they went out to get burgers for them. Maybe we were not pretty enough?
+ One of us ordered a Caprese salad. For some odd reason, half of the plate was scolding hot. When it was handed to him across the table, he had to drop it on the table and run to the bathroom to get run cold water on his hands. Not once did they say they would comp my friend's meal.
+ After the weird salad incident, the server kept insisting on comping us drinks and apologizing to everybody EXCEPT my friend who got burned. They refilled one of my friend's glasses with the incorrect wine, and then insisted it was the same.
+ The same server who lied about the sandwich also told us he was the manager when we asked to speak to his manager.
+ When the real manager showed up he kept asking \"what can I do to make this right?\" I asked if he could comp the entire meal and he said \"No, I'm already giving you 25% off and I fired the server; what else can I do?\" How does firing the server help make our experience better?
+ They finally comped our drinks and divided the rest among everyone else. We are pretty sure they messed up the calculation and that we overpaid, but we just wanted to get the hell out at that point.
+ After we caught them lying about the burgers and sandwiches, the entire staff started behaving even more erratically and murmuring stuff to themselves while looking at our table.

Again, stay away from this place. Food was mediocre at best, and the service was godawful."}
{"text":"We went here before seeing Wicked. Absolutely the WORST experience ever. Upon entering I waited to see a hostess. Nothing and no one in sight. 
We waited and then I finally asked the bartender if we should head downstairs if we had reservations. She barely gave us a nod and said 'yeah'!
We got seated and after about 10 minutes and still had no server. Finally one showed and I told her we were seeing the 6:30pm show and I needed us to be done and out in time. Server assured me they were used to handling the crowd. 

We ordered after she finally showed up and we just asked for 3 waters. We never did get any waters....or any drinks for that matter. Ever. Tables around us were walking out. They were so understaffed it was pitiful. No manager in sight. Nada. Nowhere. 

Our buffalo chicken dip came out first. It was spicy enough and was served with pita bread and tortilla chips. But there were huge chunks of chicken in it. Nothing you could even scoop onto the pita bread or chips. But ok tasting. 

I got cheese ravioli. Said there would be 3 on the menu. There were 5. But it tasted like it was thrown in the microwave. Not as good as even chef boy ar dee. My daughter got chicken fingers. We waited for honey mustard. Waited for ketchup. Not just a minute either. Like ten minutes. My younger daughter never did get parm cheese for her kids penne that she ordered. She didn't eat one bite. More tables leaving. Ridiculously expensive. 

And no one caring. When they brought our food we asked for the check. Got it. Paid cash. Over $52. Total, total rip off. I subtracted my kids penne off since she never got the cheese for it. We never did get ANYTHING to drink. 

The table next to us ordered alcohol and were trying to have a girls night before the show. Two out of their four drinks came down wrong. They just received there food when we were leaving. I'm sure they were late for the show. 

Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I went here last week while on business in Pittsburgh. The 1st floor and downstairs are like 2 different worlds. The top floor is very trendy with a bar and it seemed as if it was more for people just having drinks. So they brought us downstairs and it looked like a family-style diner or something.  Immediately I thought \"oh no, this food isn't going to be great\"

Food: The two other people I was with and I all got variations of the same thing: side salads and the quesadilla. I personally got the side caesar salad and the grilled chicken quesadilla. The side caesar was huge, and really really delish. The CROUTONS were somehow out of this world. It's funny, I thought I was just really hungry or something, but one of my dinner companions suddenly said \"man, I wish I had more croutons\". Then, the quesadilla. Delicous. Huge. With sour cream and salsa on the side. It was so, so good. 

The bill came to around $15 which wasn't bad at all. Our server was great, and helpful when we asked her for info about the downtown Pitt area."}
{"text":"Awful experience. Unfriendly and weird atmosphere. Small and overpriced menu. Requested soup and they didn't have any. The drink I had was awful and overpriced. This is what I get for going to a different place than usual. I finished my drink and went to another bar. I will never return here again."}
{"text":"I visited Pittsburgh with pretty low expectations but Grille on Seventh set a great tone for my visit. I had a late check-in to my hotel nearby and was looking for a place that I could go dressed in my casual clothes that had good food. This place fit the bill. I didn't make it to the downstairs area mentioned by another reviewer, I was seated near the bar at a booth. 

I wanted something kinda light after a long day of traveling so I ordered a bowl of minestrone (the soup of the day) and the Pittsburgh Steak Salad. Prices on these items were really reasonable, the soup was $3.99 and the salad was $12.99. The soup was good, but not special, but the fresh rolls that came with it were special - they were excellent. 

I am a guy who is generally not willing to call a salad a meal - but I would call what I got the main event any day. The Pittsburgh Steak Salad is based on field greens, and has some tomato and cucumber, but that is where the salad ends. On top of this are fries and slices of perfectly cooked to order steak, and a mound of jack and cheddar cheese that would make momma proud. Surrounding the place are slices of hard boiled egg and a cup of dressing (I had blue cheese). This meal hit the spot. 

In the bar area, they had the Penguins Stanley cup playoff game on the TVs, and after having a scotch with dinner and watching the game from my table, I had to join the group at the bar. People and bartenders were friendly and the game was good. The Pens won and I left thinking \"this is my kinda place.\""}

the food filled empty empty stomachs

that's about all i can speak for"}
{"text":"All the locals know:  don't go here.  Go around the corner to Olive or Twist.  The food and drinks are cheaper and much better, trust me!

This restaurant is an aging super model.  It *used* to be the place to go for good food and had a following.  I dont know what happened.  If you enjoy having really nice people serve you really crappy food, dine here.

And thats *if* your food ever comes out.

Its obvious the food they serve is frozen, thawed, then microwaved.  Because of the location with a better chef, maybe a better POS system or more training, I believe this place could be revived.  Every few years or so I try this place out, but its never good.

Oddly enough I've had several business meetings here.  I dont know why.  But really, those are the only times I dine here.

I'm giving 2 stars for the location, and the service is good.  I almost never give 1 star reviews."}
{"text":"Ate at this place because it was the only spot open on 7th on a Monday at dinner.  The menu is boring, and doesn't have anything interesting on it.  Our food was OK, but we ordered the special - chicken nachos.  They were pretty standard nachos, but nothing to complain about there.  Also, the women's restroom wasn't too great; one 'out of order' stall, and the other didn't' have a lock.  My advice is to keep walking past this place, unless it's the only open place."}
{"text":"Not sure what to say about rhis place.
I walked by 10 bars on a Saturday night because they were packed and I didnt think I could get a seat.
Then I spot this place and walk in.   At 9.30pm on a Saturday night, I was the only person in the entire place.
They were letting stsff off early.  They had about 15 taps but only 2 were actually tapping.
A bottle of Miller Lite was $3, a great deal.
I ordered the 4 cheese pasta.  Although it was good, I thought it was way overpriced at $22.00.  (Probably a $15 meal most places)  No salad included.  Bartender was great but menu was very expensive and very limited."}
{"text":"Only been here for drinks. Nice open and airy. Friendly staff. Somewhat generic choice of beers. Didn't eat so I can't comment on the menu/food."}
{"text":"Well, a year ago I would have rated this place with one star due to their atrocious perogies on their menu, but after making a return visit, which was my only option to get alcohol in my system before a Steelers game (thank you Pennsylvania Sunday alcohol laws), I came out with SUCH a different and improved perception of this place!

The perogies are no longer on their new menu.  I merely just ordered some appetizers, all of which were good.  The beers came quick and it was not too hard to find a table in here, even on gameday.  The bartenders were very interactive with the customers, even when you weren't sitting directly at the bar.  Beer prices were low... and I can definitely say I am SO happy to retry this place because I was pleasantly pleased and surprised."}
{"text":"I can sum this up in a few words:  Food is ok but way overpriced!!

This restaurant s just ok.  They are closed on Mondays ad sometimes other days just becuase.  It seems to be hit or miss for me when they are open.  

You are greated by a hostess who can't seat you downstairs in the main diningroom.  The basement seating does not have much ambience but offers a more private dining experience than upstiars.  I prefer to sit upstairs in the bar area.  

The service is usually slow especially for lunch.  The staff is usually friendly and drinks are kept full.  The food is usually what takes a little longer to come out.

The food is usually pretty good.  I do find that their sandwiches are very messy for some reason.  i always seem to need several napkins for a sandwich.  You can replace the french fries with a side salad for those that are looking for healthier options.

This restaurant continues to be way overpriced for what you get.  A sandwich and a drink is over $13 which I find to be expensive.

Hope this helps my fellow Yelpers!!!"}
{"text":"Worst dinner I've ever had in my life. To the point of questioning the freshness of food.

Was offered from the chef, the surf and turf that consisted of Delmonico Steak and Scallops. Came like the photo provided and I've never seen any surf n turf like this. 

My steak was not a Delmonico.  My scallops were ok. 

With such a great location and beautiful outdoor scene,  why go cheap on your food?"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, I had the burger and I was cooked to my requested preference. The service suck tho and the soda was watery and flat."}
{"text":"I agree with Darren that the soda had little fizz, but that's my only complaint. My salad was fine. My steak was supafyne!!!! lol. Juicy and moist and good. The garlic mashed potatoes were divine as were the carrots which were glazed with root beer (I think? either that or cola). The trio of dips Darren wrote of that we started with were almost a meal in itself. And the cheesecake was excellent. So was the service. I like how they clearly state in their menu that they are not averse at all to substitutions and will cut a steak of any size according to a customer's needs. A very good place in Downtown Pgh."}
{"text":"No one seemed to know what was going on. We were passed off to 3 different waiters and ordered our drinks twice. The waiter who took our order the second time didn't know if a Bells Oberon was a beer or liquor and the first guy pronounced Leinenkugel wrong."}
{"text":"We stopped here after our visit to PNC Park.

Located in the cultural district of downtown Pittsburgh, this ace is perfect for lunch or a few drinks.

We entered thru their cute little patio and were immediately greeted by their manager and bartender. This place kind of looks lie an Irish bar: dark walls and wood, lots of beer sponsored mirrors, etc. We opted to sit at the bar.

I had the turkey club wrap w/ fries and my husband tried the 7th street fries. Im not sure you can really go wrong w/ loaded fries. Do I really *need* to say he enjoyed them? Its implied right? Right. My wrap was good. The turkey was nice and moist and it had just the right amount of veggies and shredded cheese. The only thing I was really disappointed in was the tortilla. It was supposed to be on some kind of herb tortilla, you could see the herbs, but they had no taste.

Our service was excellent. Ryan was very attentive and talkative. I'd definitely recommend going in to see him for a drink or two."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I recently went to the Grille on Seventh for dinner after an event at the CLO Cabaret, since the location couldn't be beat and we had seen it frequently without ever giving it a try.

The atmosphere was relatively pleasant, with posters from various Pittsburgh theater productions adorning the wall, and our waitress was friendly.

Unfortunately, the food was disappointing. I had the Buffalo Surf and Turf, which consisted of a sirloin covered with bleu cheese and then topped with baby rock shrimp, which were themselves coated with hot sauce. These were accompanied by steamed mixed vegetables and rosemary mashed potatoes.

While none of this food was terrible, it certainly didn't meet my expectations (especially for $29.99). The steak and shrimp tasted okay, but didn't resolve into a coherent entre--it was more of a sirloin with bleu cheese plus some shrimp covered in Red Hot than something that came together as whole. The vegetables were, again, just okay; they tasted like they had been frozen and then steamed. Perhaps the best thing on the plate was the mashed potatoes, which had just the right amount of rosemary flavor.

Overall, at the end of the meal, we decided that we wouldn't be coming back. For your money and your time, there are better places to go in the Theatre District."}
{"text":"It seems like things were amiss on the fine evening that I visited this dining establishment. 

First, an empty restaurant across from the Benedum Center - right before a culinary-themed show- is probably NOT a good sign. Had I listened to my gut & not to my growling stomach, I would have walked out as soon as I walked in. 

We were seated. 

Then, the weirdness began. 

My husband and I ordered iced teas. Behind us, the staff was talking about how we ordered iced teas.. Ok, sure, fine. This topic just kept going and going. Literally 5 minutes of the staff discussing how we ordered iced tea. I am not sure how this is news?

Then, we order the food. 
 

 Salad (greens) with a refreshing citrus dressing. Unfortunately not refreshing enough to revive the wilted salad leaves. Honestly, though, it wasn't THAT wilted. Not like my husband's salad (with Italian dressing) that he had to fervently  pick at with his fork. 

My husband ordered Chicken Parm. I ordered seafood tureen. First of all, I am confused. A tureen is a dish that soup or stew is served in. I assumed it was - oh... a soup or stew? It looked like a soup or stew, but when I asked for a spoon, I was handed a tiny spoon with a very long handle - and that was with MUCH hesitation. Obviously this tiny spoon was not meant for eating. It took me about 2000000000000 spoonfuls to  get the job done. Not that I needed anything special.. just a normal spoon. 

Why even go on? It just got worse after this. 

I am hoping that this was just an off night for these guys. I will say that this place is in need of some TLC. It was quite outdated on top of the weird ambiance and sad food."}
{"text":"Went here before a Pirates game and was very disappointed.  Beers were overpriced and they were only serving one entree special, appetizers and salads.

{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after a HUGE lunch rush. Staff was working their butts off, and the manager, Kate, was doing 150 mph. The food was good, but the quality of Kate' care and attention to her customers made the experience worth 4stars,likely 4.5. Definitely will come again!"}
{"text":"This rating is for the staff who are remaining. They are dedicated to keeping this place up and running, even when their cook quits; incidentally that happened the evening I attended. Everyone was open and honest about what was happening and endeavored to go on despite the awful situation. As a side note any comments on the food prior to tonight should be disregarded as most likely they have hired a new chef. But seriously, kudos to those guys who gave their all. They were checking in on people and trying to be optimistic and transparent. As a side note they heavily discounted peoples checks who were waiting. Nice move."}
{"text":"While the server was attentive and friendly, the food was sub par. We asked for a medium burger, that was supposed to come with a fried onion ring. Got a tiny one that was well done and instead had a raw onion. Definitely not worth $14. The this and that salad was delicious (but realistically how can you mess up lettuce, feta cheese, cranberries and oranges?). It probably didn't help that there were house flies flying all around us while eating. I wouldn't recommend coming here., unless you want overpriced, unimpressive food."}
{"text":"Nothing good to say at all about this resturant. Asked for sprite, was served a glass of soda water with no flavor. Asked for Absolute & cranberry, messed that up. The potato cakes were soggy & no flavor. My filet mignon was supposed to be medium well, was very undercooked. One of the other diners in my party asked for mashed potatoes, got the potato cake instead, was told by server out of mashed but then a separate bowl appeared. I asked for no vegetables but got them anyway. I would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Decent pub fare. They have a couple of local craft beers with some non-craft options. The average food and beer come with premium prices. Yikes...all of the entrees were $20+ and the craft beers were $7 (without tip)."}
{"text":"Food was alright at best. Service is okay. They ran out of beer...2 choices Stella's of Coors Light. Very few choices of anything on the menu. Save your money go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to begin.. Our experience was.. Weird. 

My boyfriend and I were going to see Phantom Of The Opera on a Friday night, and not a place around had a less than hour wait, except for this place. We had walked right in and were greeted warmly by a nice woman, and were soon paraded down a labyrinth of stairs to \"the basement\".  

We were seated in the very back of a strangely mirrored room that may or may not have had human occupancy for a few years. I was instantly overcome with an odd musty smell which made my stomach turn. After a few minutes of sitting in awe of the weirdness we had already endured, our waitress came to take our drink order. 

However, before asking us for our drink order we were inundated with what I could only assume was a rote memorization list of \"could be\" food orders, none of which appeared on the expensive but not-at-all expansive menu. (We ordered one water and one hot tea, which included the entirety of the Lipton teabag package not just the tab.) 

The menu! By the name of the restaurant you would assume the menu items would be that of burgers and other \"grille\" items. Wrong. The menu ranged from $17 chicken Pittsburger salad(which I had gotten) to a $45 steak. My boyfriend and I decided to stick to the lower priced items so we could eat elsewhere after the show. My boyfriend had gotten a mozzarella caperse salad, which in his words is, \"hard to screw up\".  

After the waitress has taken our drink order, we didn't see her again until later. Two other people had waited on us as well. Once our food had came out, after a pleasantly short wait, they had forgotten the fries on my salad. Which wasn't a big deal at all, and they had brought me a plate of fries, which were honestly the best part about the experience. 

We ate quickly because we needed to head out, the waitress had brought out check as fast as she could because she had noticed we were going to the show, which was very kind. 


To conclude, the people are great, the food is overpriced, and the atmosphere(downstairs) is extremely odd. 
Great employees that aren't given the tools to make the restaurant a great place. The management has to step up for sure. 

Weird. Weird. Weird."}
{"text":"Ooof! What tough cookies there be in this room! I must be mentally ill for mostly enjoying our recent experience at GoS.

It was last week (I know, I'm still getting caught up), and Kay wasn't up to cooking. I also had a federal tax refund to work with. Thus, we met up in Downtown Pittsburgh for traditional steakhouse eats. 

I'll get the following caveats out of the way, all of which add up to one subtracted star:

1-The lettuce in my garden salad was slightly wilted and didn't taste fresh enough. A nice house vinaigrette made up for what was a not-so-great salad. 

2-Our sodas lacked proper carbonation, I.E. \"fizz\" if you will. 

3-Decor surely isn't edible, but the scuffed tables at the very least could use some reconditioning or a touch-up. We did, however, appreciate the vintage, framed Hollywood movie posters on the walls. 

And there were bright points to our meal, enough of which to soften the impact of the aforementioned gaffes and bring my rating to a healthy 4:

1-Our appetizer, which I cannot recall the name of, consisted of a trio of dips and spreads for fresh pita triangles and brittle pita chips to be dunked into and slathered with. The Spinach Artichoke dip was an easy, gooey, molten winner. The Roasted Red Pepper Hummus was chunky and not without zing. The Warm Goat Cheese Spread was my favorite, however, with its synthesis of tartness, luxurious cream, and crunchy, nutty texture. 

2-The main course of Surf 'n Turf was as classy and timeless as a John Huston-helmed film. Accurately seasoned and grilled, the medium-rare sirloin hemorrhaged when cut and evanesced into beef-flavored brie when fork met kisser. The steamed, not overcooked broccoli was as bright as a pile of emeralds and glistened with a precise, buttery sheen that only complimented the natural flavor of this beneficial cousin of cabbage, one I should be eating more of. The shrimp was cooked and seasoned as exactingly as the steak, resulting in chubby, briny morsels of crustacean that popped and squirted when bitten into. Very little needed to be done to prep either protein. 

3-The hearty, lardy dome of garlic mashed potatoes that accompanied the steak, shrimp, and broccoli were as lovingly lumpy as what you'd get at your granny's Sunday dinner and not only with unskinned spud but sweet, roasted bits of allium as well. Both elegant and rustic in its simplicity, the addition of any gourmet ingredients would have only lowered its tone. Who needs lobster and truffles? 

4-Dessert was a fanciful plating of chilled Chocolate Cheesecake. As decked-out as a birthday cake, the fluffy cocoa-imbibed cheesecake was velvety rich, had an Oreo crust, a flap of fudge topping it off, and was garnished with whipped cream, chocolate syrup (both white and dark), and chocolate chips. Only Cherries Jubilee would have been a more fitting finale. 

5-Alex, our skillful waiter, also happened to be an exceptionally personable gent, acting as if we were trusted friends who stumbled in cold, lost, and famished. So cordial to us he was, we almost didn't want to leave. No inappropriate conversations could be heard, unless the subjects of Van Halen, hockey, and MMA offend people. 

6-GoS explicitly states on its menu that substitutions are accommodated without a fuss and that steaks can be cut to any size as per a customer's wishes. I didn't feel the need to take them up on any this, but I appreciated the restaurant's willingness to please. 

Olden and dark,  it's unknown to me how long this restaurant has been around, but hopefully, GoS will remain a fixture in the city's concrete-and-steel heart for years to come."}
{"text":"There was a wait proper so we came here to grab a drink. We we'rent that impressed with this place. Limited warm beer selection and over priced food. We ended up leaving and getting on the wait list for proper. I did like the old style bar but otherwise was unimpressed."}
{"text":"What a shame! This place used to have decent food great drinks and a fun atmosphere.  I used to have season tickets to several theatre district venues and would stop here for their amazing martins.   Having recently had a baby it's been awhile since I was back. Came here Sat before The Lion King and was extremely disappointed.  According to the staff, they have a new owner and the place was a mess. They didn't have a drink menu, they didn't have change at the bar, they were out of most flavored vodkas, the staff seemed to be clueless, there was about a 15 minute wait just for a soda and the place was almost empty. Just terrible what the new leadership has done here.  Plus the bar TV's were almost all removed, there were less tables in the bar area.  I had great memories here watching Steeler games and great martinis and am somewhat peeved that my go-to place has been ruined.  I saw 2 tables send back food and strongly recommend you avoid this place..."}
{"text":"Crap-tacular!

Only word I can think to describe this dump. Sat at the bar. The place was half full.  Three people behind the bar.  Guy says \"will be right with you\".  Okay, so I wait.  The couple next to me got up and left.  I thought that was odd.   Another table asked for a manager because they'd ordered their food long ago and thought it got lost.  

Meantime, I get up, go to the empty hostess stand and get a menu so I can order if anyone (including the two girls behind the bar) ask me if I want something.

Look at my watch....after 10 min, I think I'll give it a few more minutes.

Another table also asked for a manager.  At that point, I thought \"This is probably not the place for me\", esp. because the guy who said he'd be right with me had to walk by me seven times while I was sitting there.

I don't blame the staff, though they clearly are not so bright when they are standing there doing nothing and people are asking for managers.  It's all on management, of which there is none, or if they do have a manager, they just don't care if people get up and leave a half empty restaurant after never being served.   I should have read the other (highly consistent) reviews!"}
{"text":"Sometimes it's all about location.  That's why I would give it two stars.  The food is nothing special and overpriced.  The ONLY reason I enjoy going there is for happy hour drinks in the summer when you can sit outside and enjoy the weather and the cool fountain next door and in the outdoor seating area.  If you stick to those rules you'll have a great time there!"}
{"text":"The sever was nice. The Food was terrible, the prices are outrageous. Don't eat at this restaurant."}
{"text":"What happened!?!  This use to be my coworker's go to place and then we had one bad experience so we stopped going.  We gave it another chance today, which is now under new ownership - with NO management!  The place was empty, and the kitchen was backed up.  My turkey melt came out with no bacon, and no cheese.  I had to send it back, and they just slapped on some cheese and bacon, w/out melting it.  Hello it's called a turkey MELT.  I use to love their fries, but these tasted just plain awful.  They weren't cooked properly, and they were pretty much cold when we got them.  The place was completely understaffed, and it looks like a lot of people have quit working there.  The only highlight of our meal was the customer service we received from the bartender.  He had to run up and down the stairs to get our food and drinks, and he did so with a smile.  He was profusely apologetic for things that were completely out of his control.  I will definitely not be giving this place a third chance."}
