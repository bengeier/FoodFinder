{"text":"Best craft beer prices in the North Hill.  Staff is excellent and friendly.  The place is infested with the children of 30 year olds on Thursday and Friday nights from 5-7pm though.  Raise your kids at home, please, like your parents did.  Please keep your kids off the pool table too; they are ruining it.  Also, it might be Whole Foods, but you at still bringing your kids to a bar.  Just saying."}
{"text":"The food is good.  It's from Whole Foods so you know it's fresh and good quality.   It's a no frills kind of place with great specials.  Buck a shuck oysters on Friday at happy hour.  It's great. 
My only drawback and it's really not a big deal is, if you want to have a drink there, make it a beer.  They have a great selection of craft beers and the bar tenders are pretty knowledgeable on the beer end of things.  The liquor selection is very limited and they don't make very good specialty drinks, even a basic cocktail. So if you want to have a drink, I'll stick to beer."}
{"text":"Service not ready for prime time. Ordered appetizers. Waited over 40 minutes and noticed others after us were served. Checked with bar staff and order never sent to kitchen. Another frustrated   customer sent an undercooked burger back. Bar is new,so hope the systems will be worked out. I loved the older, smaller pub."}
{"text":"Beers great. Food menu very limited. 6 or so entrees, then Specials (just 2).  Example. Tater tots as the only starch. Really? I am not 5 years old or 10 years old and you are apart of Whole Foods. The Grocery Store is attached!  Another option like Sweet Potato Fries? Something to think about. I hope to see some improvements."}
{"text":"Great place for a draft and a quick bite.  Not an extensive food menu but the beer menu makes up for it!  :-)"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday; delish.  French Onion soup; enough to share.  Great beer selection.  They don't have bar attached to Whole Foods' near me so this was a very nice treat!  Highly recommend stopping for a bite and a brew."}
{"text":"Definitely a beer lovers paradise. I wasn't sure if it would be ideal for a date but it was \"ok\" - different.  It was a bit crowded on a Thursday.. but then its \"Thirsty Thursday\".   Wexford Pub was recommended by several of my coworkers.  I wasn't sure what to expect and even though its part of whole foods.. the pub has its own entrance.. and it's through a beer lovers store too.    The bar appears to be bigger in pictures but seeing it in person its rather small.    I tried the \"Devils Backbone\" and fell in love.. could of drank that all night. I like the less hoppy IPA's.  

We were going to order food but there wasn't enough time.  Theres a little counter in the back by the pool table if you cant find a spot at the bar or table..  cool paintings to look at along the wall which are available for purchase too.

It was a nice visit but theres nothing really in particular that would bring me back... if anything it was a unique place for any beer lover."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Whole Foods that has a bar in it and I'm honestly sad seattle doesn't have these. This place was super cool! 24 beers on tap, I got the Evil Twin IPA and it was really good. They also have a whole beer store up front! I got the Nashville chicken sandwich and it was just the right amount of spice. I didn't know it came with tots, which were perfectly crispy by the way, so I also got the Kale Caesar salad. It had toasted chickpeas on it. To me it didn't really taste like a Caesar, but it was delicious and HUGE. I could've gotten just that honestly and had more than enough. If I find myself in Pittsburgh again I will definitely stop by."}
{"text":"$5 flights, quality rotating beer selection, and amazingly friendly staff. Very laid back atmosphere and happy to call myself a regular"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and I absolutely love it.  The draft selection is great and the food  is really good.  You can't beat the daily specials they have and they don't skimp on the portions. Their Thursday night special, a $5 double cheeseburger and tater tots is a better deal than any restaurant around.  

  It's a perfect place to go for a young family as you can order a kids meal or grab food at whole foods next door and bring it over.  This is currently our favorite place to eat (and drink).  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection but you have to watch out for tap takeovers. You can also get food/drinks from Whole Foods and bring them over. The Black Cherry wings were a nice change of pace and the grilled chicken sandwich was really well prepared. The star of the night food wise was the Brussels sprouts though. All of couldn't stop eating them and raving about them. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I went opening night and we really enjoyed it. Everyone was very attentive and the tacos were amazing. Love their selection at the front of the store for sale! Nice to have another good place to get something to eat and drink.

Went today for lunch and had the same great service. I had the wedge salad with a hamburger. The wedge salad was very good. Unfortunately, the burger was not. The flavor was awful. Another man at the bar had a burger and he said it was very good. Not sure how we could both feel so differently. I am tough on burgers.

The only other downside is the space is small and there are not many places to sit down. I do recommend it."}
{"text":"Was pretty excited to try this place, but maybe I am not their target market?  The service is pretty bad and the menu is incredibly limited.  Is this supposed to be a coffeehouse alternative?  Not sure I get what they are going for here.  I will say that we enjoyed the pool table."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and lots of beers on tap!

The pierogies were amazing, some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place, and I hope you don't go there so I can still get a seat at the bar and quick service!! They have 24 taps full of great beer. The prices are very reasonable and they have a good food menu as well. You can order flights, pints, or take a growler to go. They also have a decent selection of bottles in the front where you can get some of those to go, or even take them back to the pub and drink them there. 

One of the best parts is the free pool table in the back. It's nice to just drink a beer or two with a friend and hangout. They post their draft menu online, too so you can check before you go. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food was good although not served hot as waitress was too concerned talking to her friends"}
{"text":"Went for lunch during a very slow time and our food order was just as slow.  The bartender/waitress was pleasant enough but knew zero about craft beers.  My husband asked for recommendations but every time he asked about a beer she would have to look it up on her phone and just read us the description of the beer- kinda odd that they wouldn't train the staff on this.  The atmosphere wasn't great either as the entrance to the grocery store can be seen so it's an odd set up- it's much more like the cafe in Giant Eagle. Probably won't go back- we prefer the selection across the street at The Ale House much better."}
{"text":"We had heard good things about this place so stopped in.  Major disappointment.  All of the food on the menu was meat heavy and/or deep fried.  There were no vegan items or items I would consider healthy.  Also - although the draft beer list was long, it had a lot of similar beers on it; mostly IPAs and sours, almost no stouts or porters.  We left without eating or drinking and went somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is the first standalone bar that Whole Foods has opened, and it is very well done.

Visited on St. Patrick's day. Had two drinks.

Service: I was served by Kristen, Aimee, and Jon. Everyone was very pleasant and knowledgeable. Very attentive, and aware when you might need another drink or a glass for your beer that you purchased in a bottle or a can.

Atmosphere: The inside furnishings are a cross between mid-century modern and industrial fixtures. Plenty of wood, metal and angles. Edison filament style bulbs give the feel of an edgy bar, while over implemented, look great as opposed any other lighting options. This place is not too bright, but not too dark, the perfect amount of light. There is the bar with stools, booths, sofas, tables with seats, and the pool table. So, many options for seating. 

Food: Unfortunately did not have any this visit, but they do have a nice menu. 

Drinks: They have a large selection of beers on tap (read: 23 beers) and plenty of bottled and canned beers which you can purchase to consume there. I had the Brixton Robbie and a Springhouse Big Gruesome in a can. 

Price: Beers on tap range from $3-$8. Single cans and bottles are also reasonable from around $2-$7 depending on what you choose. Most definitely some of the best pricing for beers you can get in almost any bar. They also have mixed drinks and wine which were also quite reasonable ($7+). 

Restrooms:  Very clean. Very stylish. Very useable. If I had to use a restroom, I would choose these. 

Overall: This is a great bar/restaurant. The people who work here are friendly and knowledgeable and it feels like a great hang out place. Very good pricing, very cool atmosphere. 

Tip: They have a pool table, and it is free!"}
{"text":"Strange concept. You order at the bar. Get the order from the bar. Then clean your own table! What the hell did I leave a tip for? The food was less than average and over-priced. I had the fish sandwich. It came with lousy tater-tots for $10! My daughter had ck Caesar, extra charge for the ck! Pretty sad."}
{"text":"I love Whole Foods  I do still get a little nervous at the check out register but still shop there. I like they knowing they have standards, I like knowing they won't put it on the shelf if it has things that are
Bad for us or questionable, this saves me time and value that however i can not believe what a poor job they do on any and all prepared foods . Whole Foods stop and FIX this it is not that hard bring someone in from the outside you do not have anybody who cooks or you won't listen to those that can. One example the other day pressed for time purchased turbot for four of us, way to late to make my clam chowder soup did not even have time to drive to Labriollas so I purchased clam chowder from Whole Foods, how did they get clam chowder to taste that bad yeah I know I am hard to please but not so with my wife and she tasted and declined a bowl, other than that !!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and there is a lot to like. The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable about the beers they have on tap. I like the atmosphere and the great variety of beers on tap. I also like that if you get a beer you like, you can walk over to the shop and buy some to take home. I'm also happy with the quality of their food.  I got their double burger and tots both times I went and it is really good and worth the $10. You definitely don't leave hungry. I'm glad Whole Foods decided to try this out because it's a great idea."}
{"text":"My wife and I made a stop here on a Friday during happy hour to try something different.  Being attached to Whole Foods, my expectation wasn't too high for this place being friendly on my wallet.  However, to my surprise their prices were extremely reasonable! Even if you come here outside of happy hour, they still have excellent prices on beer.  

The place was fairly packed when we arrived.  We were able to find a table and get settled in.  The setup there is a bit different; they have community seating which is nice, and when you want to order food or a drink there is a place at the end of the bar where you can walk up and someone will take your order.  Next to where you order, there are a few board games and trivia games that you can take back to your table and play.  

My wife and I just ended up ordering some beer and cider and played a foodie trivia game.  The drinks were good and very reasonably priced.  The food also smelled amazing especially the fried fish sandwich.  The only negative things I could say about it here is that it was hard to hear at times across the table with the noise level in the room, and the service for ordering food or drink can be pretty slow.  I think I waited in a line of about 4 people for 10 minutes before I was able to place my first order.  

We will for sure be making more stops here to hang out.  They have a very neat atmosphere, great drink selections, and some good looking food.  I would highly recommend making an effort to visit this pub!"}
{"text":"This is a nice space located past the beer shop at Whole Foods. Put in our order at the bar and they brought it to us when ready.
I had a fried avacado sandwich. ..I wasn't expecting the whole half of an avacado deep fried and put on a bun but that's what I got. It was a little difficult to eat and didn't have much flavor to it. It came with a side of tater tots...the portion was so huge that it looked like I didn't even make a dent in them by the time we left.
I'd try them again but we haven't yet."}
{"text":"First time here. We went on a Tuesday night because it's Trivia nite!! Got their early to be sure we got a table. No problem. It starts at 7:00pm, so if you arrive at 6:45 you'll get a table. There are about 3 team regulars. We ordered food. Portions were a nice size.  We had a burger with tots, wings, and a fried avocado sandwich. Originally ordered the vegan chili but were told it wasn't good so they wouldn't serve it to us!! It came with cornbread so she gave us that for free. Everything was fresh, the place felt clean and not noisy! They have about 15 beers to choose from. It's a hidden gem connected to the Whole Foods."}
{"text":"Great pricing on their craft beers and some very good choices. Always have some good stouts on tap.  Food is good. Their flights are the lowest in town."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection? Check. 
Fresh and tasty menu? Check. 
Great staff? Check. 
Speedy service? Check. 
Pool table? Check. 
Build your own six pack? Check. 
TV's to watch the big games? Check. 

Seriously, this place truly has it all. At first glance, this place might be easy to pass up, but trust me, it's a hidden gem. 

First the beer: This place is a beer palace. Literally. There's over 20 beers on tap and the selection is constantly changing! I've been here dozens of times and never tried the same thing twice! Plus, if I don't like anything on draft (that's never happened, by the way) I can always grab a six pack or single bottle. 

Next, the food: My absolute favorite things on the menu are the grilled chicken sandwich and the brussel sprouts. Now, I know what you're probably thinking: \"Ew. I don't like brussel sprouts!\" Yeah, me neither. These brussel sprouts, however, literally leave me licking my fingers. They are cooked to perfection and tossed in a honey jalapeno sauce. Absolutely delish. Many dishes come served with a side of tator tots. They, too are cooked to perfection. The menu is fairly small, but they have mastered everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"The best draught list in Allegheny county.  

If you like beer you must make a trip to this gem of Wexford.  They has 20+ beers, none of which are the big INBEV swill.  Expect to see local brews from Dancing Gnome, Draai Laag, Full Pint, Grist House along with some popular hard to find favorites like Bullfrog, Troegs, Sole, Pizza Boy, Evil Twin, and Fat Heads.  The Wexford Pub also does flights which if you're into that thing is an amazing deal.  Four 5oz pours for $5?!  Yep I sad it.
They also have food specials every day and you can grab snacks from Whole Foods and bring them in.  How can you go wrong?
If I have one complaint it's that so many people have realized how awesome this place is.  It gets crowded and even during Happy Hour you'll see a bunch of kids which having a 3 year old I would not walk her into that environment.
Protip:  When your wife and daughter want to shop at Whole Foods run over and pound a pint.
Protip II: They also have a great 6 pack and bomber selection.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Yeah.  Whole Foods has hit a home run with this insert into their store.  Great, really great selection of beers, many of which are simply not available elsewhere.  Staff knows things about the selections.  Friendly.  Well laid out.  A great stop for a weekend shopping trip."}
{"text":".... a must try ..thats a a great smart adds to wholefood that make you feel you eating in the right place because the food quality that you get ..try their  burgers you will love it ..."}
{"text":"Whoever thought to add a pub to a grocery store had a great concept. I've stopped in here several times before getting groceries at Whole Foods. It's located next to Whole Foods & you walk through that bottle shop to enter the pub. They have 24 craft taps that keep changing. Quite a few IPA's. You can taste before buying or get a flight. They have a limited menu featuring a few salads, sandwiches & entrees. You can either sit at the bar or order at the bar & seat yourself at a table & they'll bring your food out. Thursday's they have their double burger with tots half price & there are other specials on weekdays. They do have cider, wine & liquor too and are open until 10pm. Service while seated at the bar can be spotty. The female bartenders were more attentive. A few of the hipster dudes you have to ask for a menu, then they never come back for your order & you have to pull them out of conversions with other patrons. But, all in all, beers good, food is good & it's a quit pit stop if you need things at Whole Foods. Their credit card system at the bar has been non-functional for months now, so you can only pay cash at the bar. If you're using a card they give you the tab & you pay it in the bottle shop on the way out & there's a jar there for bartender tips."}
{"text":"It's really different (bar service only no waitresses) and cool (pool table, trivia games to take to your table). Anyway, Thursdays are $5 burgers (double patty),  it wasn't the best burger ever but definitely good for 5 bucks. I got a fried avocado sandwich (um, yum!). Both came with tater tots. We got a pitcher of Labatt's for $6. Also for $6, a heaping plate of sweet & spicy brussel sprouts, which were also delish. Not loving the morning after burps, however. All in all, I thought it was a good. and pretty quick since you didn't have to wait for service."}
{"text":"I had kept hearing about The Wexford Pub on Facebook, and thought they were talking about the older small bar that was originally in Whole Foods. I always enjoyed grabbing a quick beer there - but the Wexford Pub has taken it to a new level!

The area is spacious and clean. Plenty of space to find a seat: at the bar, high tops, low tops and even a few couches. The beer selection is on point, I'm an IPA drinker myself and they've had more than a few each time I've visited. 

I've also gotten two meals. The first was the burger special on Thursday nights. What a deal! It was so delicious and only $5! Pair that with the happy hour beer pricing and you've got yourself a cheap but quality date night, what more could you ask for? The next time I went for lunch and got the chicken sandwich and upgraded to Brussels sprouts as a side - amazing. Seriously. 

If you haven't checked The Wexford Pub out yet- what are you waiting for? It's probably my new favorite spot in the North!"}
{"text":"This Whole Foods location has a small pub attached that serves beer along with various pub fare featuring daily specials. On Fridays the special is $1 Oysters beginning at 4pm. Got there a little after 5:30pm and the bartender said they didn't have any more and looking around the Pub I didn't see any oyster shells anywhere on the tables so who knows when they ran out.

So I asked the bartender if I could order a pizza instead and they said you have to go to the supermarket/prepared foods section and then carry it yourself over to the pub. A bit of a hassle but I figured okay I'm here might as well eat. I walk over to order some pizza and the only pre-made slices they have available were some strange looking pesto-chicken concoction. I try to order a plain Margarita pizza since my kids would never eat that but the person behind the counter told me they wouldn't be able to get to it until after 7pm....a 90 minute wait!

By this time the line to order pub food at the bar was pretty crowded and I didn't want to wait any longer. So we ended up going to a fast food place on Rt. 19. Don't waste your time going here. Go to a real pub or pizzeria or anyplace that knows how to operate a restaurant and not a hipster super market trying to be ultra-cool by offering food/yuppie beer but then not being able to actually produce it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!!  There is a gang of us that go every Tuesday for trivia.  We get a bottle of wine in the store...order food...  If the kids are there - they go get a salad or pizza or mochi.  Sometimes we just get cheese and crackers from the store.  The food from the bar is fantastic - fresh and delicious with great weekly and daily specials.  A lot of the tables are communal so you chat with others and interact.  It's all very friendly.  It feels like a place that could easily be the social center of the neighborhood.  The staff is great.  The restaurant is clean and cozy.  I look forward to going every week!"}
