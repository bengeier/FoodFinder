{"text":"Big fan of Caribbean food. Normally eat at Spence's Bakery, Raps, Mitzies and Mr. Jerk. Thought I would give this place a try.   Service is great and the restaurant is relatively clean. Prices are standard, about $10 for large dinners.   Ordered jerk chicken and pork. I must admit, the food smelt and looked great.    The food is flavorful and spicey but I found it lacked the substance or complexity of flavors that I have grown accustomed to. Very salty, which I think masked the other flavors/ingredients. Perhaps I have become spoiled by the places I normally frequent but it also lacked the smoked taste in the meat that I am used to. Jerk chicken is absolutely amazing when smoked in a drum for a long time. Those that don't do this must have an amazing recipe to offset the loss of smoked flavor.   If you have a palate for salty food this place is worth a shot. I would still rate it better than 60% of the Caribbean restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Love this place, I'm addicted to the Chicken Roti. The Jerk Chicken, Oxtail and Patties are great too. I found nothing so far to be too spicy, I prefer to amp it up on my own anyways. I look forward to trying the rest of their menu. Nice to have a more affordable delicious option in the neighborhood. Annie and Keisha are super friendly and seem to be doing this for all the right reasons."}
{"text":"I truly think this is the best jerk chicken spot I've found in a long time.  Highlights for me - clean - portions are huge  -price is average, making it worth the money - venturing out with other delivery services (means I can have lunch delivered to me)  Only thing is you'll have to find street parking."}
{"text":"I had the jerk chicken and it decent.  I would grab it again.  Curious to try the roti and other items next time"}
{"text":"It's a new place. They serve lunch and dinner platters. And whole range of Caribbean food. I tried the chicken roti. The outside layer of the roti was tender. The curry chicken and potato was generous. Loved the flavour. I like it more spicy. So I had the pepper sauce which was available on the tables."}
{"text":"Clean little place . I did take out . A lot of food for 10 dollars . I took the chicken roti and it was not spicy . Taste is ok . Good for a quick take out in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Food was good....limited dining space...parking was difficult to find."}
{"text":"This is some of the best caribbean food I've ever had. The fried chicken is incomprehensible with how crispy it is-and I got it delivered. The ox tail and goat have made my life that much better because I know I have access to this food."}
{"text":"I write this to be fair.  Annie seems like a sweetheart.  But I've had the jerk and oxtail and both times they tasted like browning and salt.  If you're experienced with the cuisine, and esp if you're yourself Caribbean, this has to be a pass.  Again, she seems real sweet so I didn't want to do this, but the food is not up to par.  If you like salty food and the taste of browning (if you don't know what browning is, you might love this food so go enjoy!) then this is for you. If you like your jerk to taste like jerk and your oxtail to be succulent and flavourful, you have to pass on this place, unfortunately.  But again, Annie seems like a sweetheart and she's opened in a great location - where the locals have no idea what good Jamaican foot tastes like. So she's a smart businesswoman as well.  But I felt I had to provide some context since the 4.5 stars tricked me and that's not totally fair.  So my Yelp-conscience kicked in and I had to throw up a quick review.  But Annie seems like a sweetheart.  Did I say that yet??"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent eater of Ritz's & Island Foods in the city, and Annie's is very tasty.  I like Annie's for its value and location as I find Island Foods portions to be very small.  The time that my wife ordered the Ox Tail dinner... had more ox tail than other places.  This one's more expensive, but they make it worth it.  Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been amazing!  So tasty - the chicken stew with rice and peas is my favorite so far.  Great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Tried Annie's for the first time last week. Had the jerk chicken with rice and peas and curry chicken roti. Jerk chicken was awesome, perfectly cooked, delicious, and spicy. The rice and peas were also excellent.  The roti, while not the best I've had, was still really good and I would get it again. Looking forward to going back to try some more menu items."}
{"text":"We tried the fried chicken and jerk chicken. It came with rice and beans as well as coleslaw. The chicken was so good! Nice spice to it! After reading some reviews it sounded like it might not have enough spice to it but when we ate it we were pleasantly surprised. There was a great kick to the chicken. The chicken was so moist unlike some other jerk chicken places and seasoned perfectly. The chicken pieces were good cuts and not fatty. We also tried the Beef patty.  Excellent!  They only had mild so would love to try a medium.  I didn't know what this place was when driving by and looked it up to know it was Caribbean food. I agree with the review here that says that a sign showing that it's Carribean food would be beneficial! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Bold flavours, good portions   Had the curried chicken and the fried chicken.  Both were served on rice and beans with a side of cole slaw.  It was all very good.    While I enjoyed the food, I usually prefer more veggies with my meal - I'd prefer a little less rice and beans and some more veggies.     I'll be back."}
{"text":"Haven't yet had the opportunity to experience this restaurant as a dine in. But from the food quality and quantity when I've ordered in through UberEats, this place is definitely a must try next time I'm in this area. I can speak to the food so here it goes. The curry goat is amazing perfectly seasoned and in my experience when I've asked for extra curry on my rice they go one further and put extra meat(no extra charge through UberEats, at least) the same goes for The delicious curry chicken. The Oxtail is pretty sweet and the beef patties  are just spicy enough and the meat inside tender enough to hit the spot. A definite must if you're in the mood for West Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"What struck me the most, how friendly the 2 ladies working were.  Sometimes u are almost thrown off by politeness, feels almost rare and unique.. Jerk chicken was excellent, nice gravy.  Only mention, temp was on cool side, not hot enough."}
{"text":"I am eating it as I type.  Amazing !!  Tried the veg patty, spicy beef patty, roti and jerk chicken. My wife and I are thrilled."}
{"text":"Had the Jamaican patties along with jerk chicken with rice and peas from Annie's twice now and I gotta say she knows what she's doing! My family loves it!  Can't wait to try the other items on the menu. Oh and don't forget to ask her to top it with ox tail gravy! So good.   A note to Annie's: you should really put up a Jamaican flag or something in the window or on your sign to show this is Caribbean food so people driving by or on the bus notice!"}
{"text":"Small portions, the rice wasn't tasteful and the Jerk was near ok. Not coming back sorry !"}
{"text":"Super tasty, authentic and comforting!  So happy Annie's has moved into the neighborhood. Reasonable prices to! We had jerk chicken, fried chicken, oxtail, chicken roti and beef patties. I'm more of a mild-medium spice fan and this was slightly spicier but very manageable! Coleslaw cuts the heat. Thanks for the excellent dinner. I can see this place being a staple. Also they don't deliver but we had Door Dash deliver. So easy!"}
{"text":"These guys are fairly new but they've got a great thing going, amazing Roti's and Jamaican patties. Friendly staff, delicious hot sauce, great location, and a breath of fresh air and a welcome change in this neighborhood. Wishing the very best to Keisha and everyone involved!"}
{"text":"I kicked off 2017 by grabbing some Jamaican food for lunch near my house, as my budget and time to randomly travel to Ocho Rios has been reduced to like zero.  I ordered the jerk chicken lunch special ($5.99).  It came with 4 pieces of jerk chicken atop a pile of rice and peas and an extremely tiny container of coleslaw. I should have just ordered the small jerk chicken meal ($7) as it was slightly bigger and perhaps might have come with more 'slaw.  The chicken was very tender and flavourful.  I will usually order bbq chicken in Jamaican joints as I'm shy of the spice.  Definitely could have used a bigger coleslaw to tame the kick in the chicken.   I'll probably be back to try the curry chicken and the oxtail meals...it's going to be a cold, cold winter and I need a warm reminder of the Caribbean."}
