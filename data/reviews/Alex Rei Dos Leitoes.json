{"text":"Have to say I love this place. I don't eat meat, but the rice, potatoes and fish is amazing. I really like Portuguese potatoes, but these are on another level of tasty. Nice simple place with tasty food. I get cravings for these potatoes late at night. Try them."}
{"text":"Nice chicken n potatoes but pretty salty. The potatoes are little spheres. The hot sauce is dangerously hot (the owner will tell you to 'be careful' with it). Overall, quite good, family run (or so it looks) and very very inexpensive!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a healthy, home made type of take out, this is the best place to go.  Their half chicken dinner for $10 can feed 2 people and it's the tastiest roast chicken in Toronto!  The combo comes with your 2 choices of a heaping portion of Parisienne potatoes, salad, and rice.  Don't forget to ask for their home made piri piri sauce!  They also sell roast pig but you need to order at least a day in advance.  You can get a whole pig for $140, half for $70, or $28/kilo.  It's slightly more than what Bairrada charges but it's worth the extra couple of bucks!"}
{"text":"Only two reviews for...the best place for roasted chicken in the GTA?! This place is awesome. Chicken always perfectly done---unlike first reviewer, I like it crispy and with a bit of char---and it's also always tender and succulent. Their spicy sauce is tops: peppers fermented in oil, not the red sauce, as Lorian notes, and that fermentation adds some serious umami to the mix.  Add great salad with plenty of peppers and tomatoes, tasty bread, olives, other good sides, and you can't go wrong. Plus everyone who works here is super nice and generous. I travel 30 minutes to eat here! There are three stools, or you can go eat in Trinity Bellwoods park."}
{"text":"Just finished a 1/4 chicken plate with a bit of rice , potatoes and salad and it great !! I asked for spicy and it was indeed spicy but delicious nevertheless!! I didn't want to knock one whole star on the fact that the cutlery you are provided is made up of flimsy plastic!  I'm in a food comma right now. Another great thing is that their prices are quite reasonable. For instance my plate with a bottle of sparking water was 9.50 !"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! The best chicken we've ever had. This family run business is not only welcoming but makes the best homemade Portuguese food ever!  We moved to Toronto a year ago and happened to find Alex Rei Dos Leitoes we are so happy we did.  We've had a few party's and ordered for up to 150 people. We only had Great response from everyone.  Thank you Alex Rei Dos Leitoes."}
{"text":"Delicious & juicy BBQ chicken with the potatoes is heaven! Be sure to mix the rice with hot sauce, it's a great combo.  Service was friendly and the chicken was still warm even after 45+ minutes of driving in winter weather. Be sure to call beforehand to ensure you don't miss out on any favourites. Also good for large group take-outs. Cash only  Ordered 2 BBQ chickens: 2 x $13 Medium potatoes: $6 Small rice: $3 And medium hot sauce: $1  All together = $36 (tax included) and was enough to feed a family of 4"}
{"text":"I know this place is known for their chicken... but I'm not overly crazy about it. What I love about this place is their hot sauce!! I can put that Sh*** on anything! and their potato balls are to die for!! no where else can compare they are so moist and with that hotsauce-- a perfect match!  I always stop by to buy a container of it its literally liquid gold ."}
{"text":"A small Portuguese takeout restaurant with a few bar style seats at the front window. Friendly atmosphere and staff....you know it's going to be good when the staff, I presume the owner, is humming as she works. Had the quarter chicken with Parisian style potatoes and rice. Ordered the chicken spicy. All was very good with generous portions. Would like to put in an order for a suckling pig sometime, looks awesome!  Satisfying meal, highly recommend."}
{"text":"BBQ chicken for $12.50 including tax! This place located on the Ossington strip is bare bones. Doesn't have fancy seating, ironic signage, or long lines. They don't even have a hot table or spit to see the food.  But just go with ordering the BBQ chicken. They don't say a lot or chit chat much. Just simple takeout joint.  That hot sauce is super spicy. Just a little dip and it leaves my mouth burning!  The chicken itself is juicy and flavorful.  Will definitely come again when in the mood for premade chicken!"}
{"text":"Best Portuguese food ever! I've had it here and there throughout the last 20 years and it's consistently good. I would pay big money to have the recipe for those potatoes or to have them delivered to my house"}
{"text":"I found this place on Google after my local Churassco place (Churassco Villa) has been closed due to transit construction for over 7 months to satisfy major cravings, I ventured across town by TTC.  Upon arrival and seeing it was an empty, old school looking and clean hole in the wall with food hidden in containers instead of being displayed, I was a bit hesitant and was disappointed the chicken's not made fresh per order.  The sides looked as if it might be bland.  However, I ordered the 1/2 chicken combo with oven Parisian potatoes, broccoli/rapini, and rice.  Luckily, before I left I asked if there was peri peri sauce or I would have been unamused since I didn't know it was not in the bag.  The young girl was friendly and patient too.  I microwaved half the portion at home and to my pleasant surprise, the food was really tasty!  Even the simple looking potatoes were yummy!  My only complaints are that I had to ask for the peri peri sauce and that I wasn't prepared for it to be firey hot although tolerable because after the spice hits it dissipates.  The food is enough for 2 meals (I'm a big eater!)!  BTW, this place wins!  My regular place that's currently shutdown due to road construction cooks chicken fresh per each order and they even charcoal grill Parisian potatoes instead of oven bake and their peri peri sauce comes in mild or spicy.  Although the portion's decent, it's not as huge as here (their vegetable sides are disappointing).  Both places are tasty in slightly different ways.  However, service is way friendlier at Alex Rei Dos Leitoes, you get way more food here, and I love their healthy greens so this place wins!  Too bad I have to trek across town to get the food though.  I also accidentally learned that these two places are operated by the same family!"}
{"text":"Finally....a chicken place whose hot sauce doesn't taste like Frank's straight out of the bottle!  Their hot sauce is concentrated so that a little bit makes the chicken nice and spicy without having to use so much that the bread gets soggy.  Also the sauce isn't bright red so if you spill on your clothes (a frequent problem with me), you can't really see it.  The prices (on the chicken sandwich at least) are lower than the rest of the neighbourhood.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Second time eating it and it was as good as last time. Chicken is a little dry but well marinated on the outside, the potatoes are amazing and the salad paired it off well with their house dressing. Quick service and cheap for a huge amount of food.  $13 whole chicken  $6 medium potatoes  $6 medium salad  Cash only and no tax. No place to really sit and eat so its best for take out."}
{"text":"This is more of a take out spot despite their sign that says Eat-In as there are only two stools for patrons to sit on. I ordered the half chicken dinner to go which comes with any combination of potatoes, rice, and salad for 10 bucks.  The service was friendly and looks to be family run as there was a sweet little girl who helped fetch my drink. The cashier who took my order really stuffed the takeout box with food, so much so that it was bulging out of the box.  The food itself was so so. I blame that partly because I am about 15 minutes away from the place, so by the time I got to eat it the food wasn't as fresh. The chicken, however, was a bit too salty and a bit too burnt for me, especially the drum and wings.  It was an overly filling meal, nonetheless.  They also have daily food specials every day of the week which I would be willing to try."}
{"text":"My first thought about this place is \"MEH and UGH\". In comparison to other places in the city, the prices are pretty cheap. In comparison to other places in the city, I didn't find the food to be that good. For starters the 1/4 chicken I ordered was drier than I care for my clucker to be. Or perhaps that should be second, the real first is the questionable cleanliness of the place. Let me explain, on the way in a saw an elderly lady with a beautiful Husky breed dog leaving out of the door next to the store. The dog was attempting to go in the restaraunt and I made a comment about him wanting lunch too. When I entered the place there was a couple being helped. The one person scurried about too busy to even acknowledge me. About three minutes later, long enough for an urgent bathroom break, in walks... you guessed it, the dog walking lady. She went behind the counter and decided at that very moment, even with a customer waiting, that the food area needing a cleaning. She grabbed a washcloth dingier than four different shades of gray, and commenced to wiping down the counters and the bottom cabinets. Never washed her hands, but I guess there was no need considering the towel used. She did rinse and wring the now more gross towel when she was done and dried her hands on a second, overused and \"ready for the dumpster\" towel. Only afterwards, was I acknowledged and my order taken. Um, ok. Annoyed, but having already trekked across town on the word of fellow Yelpers (and facing slim pickings with it being Easter weekend), I ordered, but watched her like a starving hawk. I was confident that she didn't touch the rice or the broccoli, but the chicken was out of sight, so I'm not sure what hapened there. All in all, the rice was good, but I was squeamish the entire plate (which I didn't finish) thinking of the contaminating possibilities and couldn't fully enjoy the meal. Two stars for price and effort."}
{"text":"picture this: I'm eating chicken and spicy rapini, on a park bench, chewing cartliage while the intense flavor of wood-fired churrasco lingers in my mouth and lips, smack goes my lips as i wipe every last ounce of flavor from my finger tips and the spicy rapini cuts the fat as i chomp down on every last stem and bud of the green. im not bothered by the throngs of people walking by, wondering what on earth im doing enjoying this mystery box.   but. this. is. it.  for at least 20 years ive been eating churrasco style chicken, in every corner of the city. in my 20s while i lived away from the city it was one of those things i missed and could never really find in the cities i lived in, and upon returning ive been on a mission to try every hole in the wall churrasqueria i can to find the good, good.   and this is is really it.  the real deal;the good good.   chicken cooked in a wood oven out back (the only one of its kind) and what the owner tells me is THE oldest place in the city.   its really good, its really unassuming, and its really freakin portuguese.  again, its really really good."}
{"text":"Apparently this guy is The King Of The Suckling Pig, but I've only had his chicken, so let's call him The Prince Of The Chicken.  The prince is excellent at making Portuguese rotisserie chickens, in spicy or oily, and they are both fabulous. The spicy has a real kick to it, so I usually just enjoy the milder oil sauce. All of the sides are cooked in meat broth, meaning you can eat about 15 potato scoops before you realize what you did. Look what you did!   Seriously cheap. Take out only."}
