{"text":"This place has become my favourite go to for Chinese food.  The food here is always fresh made to order piping hot and always served within ten minutes.  Friendly staff and prices are fair."}
{"text":"Read good reviews so wanted to try out , drove 15 Kms from home to pick food . Asked them their special , was suggested pepper steak n mushroom and beef lomein.
Was very disappointment with the good . Watery steak with soya flavour . Authenticity missing in the good we ordered . May not go again .
Wish they could be more elaborative in suggesting their delicacies ."}
{"text":"So my wife and I just came back to Brampton recently and needed to find a good Chinese restaurant that competed with the golden stove (which I reviewed on here, check it out if you haven't yet) in Etobicoke, Lakeshore area. To our surprise first place we picked was Sunlight. So far we have ordered delivery twice and we are very pleased. The food is great, cooked perfectly and tasty. It is a little pricey compared to our other place but I think it is worth the extra considering there isn't much around (as far as i know, if you have suggestions that would be great) 

One thing I would recommend them changing on one of thier dishes would be the shrimp fried rice. Instead of unflavoured jumbo shrimp try adding some cooked miniature shrimps, would be a lot tastier rice for sure. Still good though.

If you're looking for big portions and a not so bad price, definitely check this place out! Oh and try the orange chicken, really good.

Friday night deliveries could take a while, about an hour and half to be exact so order early!! That is all.

Enjoy!!!"}

{"text":"Ordered delivery. The food arrive in 45 minutes and it was warm. This was my first time eating from here and it won t be my last. We ordered chicken balls, honey garlic chicken wings, egg roll, spring rolls and shrimp with chicken fried rice. The portions were great! Loved the chicken balls and sauce so yummy. Finding a good Chinese delivery restaurants has been difficult, this is now my go to."}
{"text":"So me and my sister ordered delivery from this place last night and it wasn't bad... but it wasn't the best either. Reason for the 3 stars? Okay... first let me tell you what we ordered...

We got Chicken Balls, Shrimp Fried Rice, Spring Rolls, Egg Rolls, Spicy Chicken Wings, Sweet and Sour Chicken and Singapore Noodles... 

The shrimp fried rice was decent but nothing to call home about. The sweet and sour chicken was good but was I eating chicken? The way thw peices are cut, I did not like.. I prefer to see the chicken, instead of breaded sweet and sour, God knows What? But it did taste good... The spicy chicken wings were good, (I'd order this again). The Singapore Noodles tasted like curry skinny vermicelli Noodles, they were decent but I wasn't expecting that taste, I wouldn't order his again (my sister enjoyed it though). The chicken balls were really good, I'd order this again, if I were to come or order from here again but chances are I never will and here's why... The Spring Rolls were HORRIBLE! I Adore spring rolls and didn't think I can ever come across a bad spring roll and I Did! I couldn't even finish one and we put in 5 freaking orders of spring rolls and even my sister was like... How are we going to finish these? If we had a dog, I wouldn't even give it to my dog. It was so bland and had a weird taste to it.. The egg rolls were Terrible as well but not as bad as the spring rolls... The egg rolls were bland and didn't have any flavor, could definitely use a little more salt and seasoning, that's for sure.. They didn't even use the Chinese 5 spice seasoning , or whatever it is that they use.. it was Bland, Bland, Bland!!! Even I make better eggs rolls / spring rolls then this and this is Exactly why I will never order from here again. How do you get Egg and Spring Rolls Wrong at an Asian restaurant, How? Come'on... The delivery took 1 hour in total to come and my sister lives less then 10 minutes away from the place, if the food was top quality, I wouldn't have minded but it was a long wait time, for average or below average Chinese food. If you order from here again, I recommend the products I liked but if you are a spring roll or egg roll lover, like me... be cautious."}
