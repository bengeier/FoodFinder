{"text":"Came here again today with another friend. I finally tried the Original Fried Chicken (with herb salt) as suggested by fellow Yelpers. My friend and I both agreed there wasn't anything that special to the chicken. Really it was just regular fried chicken. I guess I was disappointed because of the hype.   I also got Noodles in Chicken Soup which was great as usual. The broth was savory and the noodles were perfectly cooked. My friend got Bulgogi and enjoyed it. (Like I mentioned in my previous post, Bulgogi here isn't actually typical Korean Bulgogi, but more of a plain stir fry.)  The staff wasn't that great today. They kept forgetting us and we had to consistently call them over. They messed up our bill too. It wasn't very busy either so that was disappointing.   Oh well, I don't mind. I guess they had an off-day. I'm still coming back for the good food."}
{"text":"This place has all the essentials of a classic find: A tiny hole in the wall entrance, a somewhat dive look, seems to be run by \"just a couple of guys\" who double as the waiters and chef, and fantastic food. As an added bonus you're as likely to hear the language of the country whose food they specialize in spoken as you are English.  I tried the \"blazing fire chicken\" and kimchee fried rice and was not disappointed. The chicken is easily enough to serve two, with a side of rice of course, and has a pretty decent kick to it. You do have to be on your toes as you eat it, though, as this is not boneless. Some chunks have a bit of bone, others don't. But in my mind that's not a problem, it makes for better flavor and just means you have to pay attention to what you eat. No shoveling it down here!  The kimchee fried rice was also fantastic, spicy, plenty of egg, a good sesame flavor under it all, and chock full of delicious pickled cabbage. If you've never tried kimchee this is a great introduction to it, and if you know the culinary delight that it is you'll really appreciate this rice.  If you're in the neighborhood give it a chance, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is right downstairs from my condo so I come here a lot. The waitstaffs are very nice,  I love their tofu skew and salt n pepper fried chicken."}
{"text":"I love this place! I used to go to the original Markham location to have their buldak (blazing spicy chicken?) and yang nyum chicken (sweet and spicy chicken?). It's an old favourite and whenever I crave some good old Korean chicken, I go there. I've only had buldak at the Bloor location and it's still pretty good, although I find it little less spicy.  At 710 Yonge St, my favourite is the fried chicken. The salt/pepper that comes with the wings is like crack! I sometimes just taste the s+p alone... it's that good. I've also had the lunch menu: the tofu soup, pork bone soup, and the rest are pretty tasty and very affordable for downtown.  The decor is not that fancy, but it's very typical in Korean restaurants (let's be honest, we go for the reasonably priced, delicious Korean food). The service is pretty good too: it doesn't get too busy during lunch hour and is only serviced by one waiter usually. Anyway, I'll keep coming by!"}
{"text":"Try out the Blazing Fire Chicken it's pretty good and hot with a thin layer of cheese. Definitely choose MILD spice level if you would like to have some spice but can't eat too spicy/don't eat spicy food very often. MILD is already MEDIUM SPICE LEVEL."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is addicted to this place. We have not been able to come by because it's out of the way for us, but I think about it every once in a while. I'm addicted to their fried chicken."}
{"text":"I think I'm on a Korean addiction. - I've had Korean food for the past 2 days and i'm still craving for some more! (maybe I'll have some again later tonight? hehe) Anyways I'm pretty sure the name of the restaurant says it all 'Home of Hot Taste'... it's spicccyy so If you like spicy food or Korean food in general, this is the place for you. This restaurant serves a variety of Korean dishes but they specialize in spicy chicken since half their menus are filled with items such as \"spicy fiery chicken\" or chicken wings. They also have some crazy names for some dishes like 'Blazing Fire Chicken with Cheese' (which is really good and spicy! - the cheese does some what help tame down the spiciness). The entire thing comes out in a hot plate with bite-sized nuggets of chicken that have been sauteed in Korean chili pepper paste, added with cheese on top. (yum!). I also decided to order the Teriyaki Chicken Wings since I was deprived of Popeye's which came in a basket and was pretty well done (I would say it's an Asian Style of Louis Wings but with bigger chicken pieces). It had a bit of a sweet taste to it so if you like something between the lines of honey-garlic, this is the dish for you and I definitely enjoyed it. Home of Hot Taste is a good place for some pretty inexpensive spicy Korean dishes. They are also open pretty late, until 2 am, so it's a good, cheap sit down option if you need to grab a late dinner."}
{"text":"Service: Service was definitely lacking, they only had 2 people serving the entire restaurant on a busy Sunday evening. Was hard to flag them down to order. Food took about 40 mins to come. We just ordered half original, half garlic soy sauce chicken for the 4 of us. Then later ordered seconds.. boneless chicken garlic soy sauce.  Food: The boneless chicken was almost like popcorn chicken, pieces were tiny and extremely garlic-y. The original was slightly crispy and moist on the inside, wasn't as crispy as i imagined it'll be."}
{"text":"After seeing some reviews,  I had to come try this place out myself.     Ordered the following items...  Oyster kimchi fried rice Fried spicy wings Fried garlic soya sauce wings Fried original style wings  The rice was actually pretty good.  Nice and spicy but a bit short on the oystes.  This is a definitely must get when you come here.   In general,  the wings were fried pretty good.  No complaints here.   The spicy sauce was not as spicy as I hoped but not bad.   The garlic soya sauce was so so.   The original was actually pretty good... almost a little like Popeyes.  The speed of how fast the food came out was a little disappointing.   There was only 2 other tables at that time but,  the wings took forever to come out.    Overall, not a bad place to go for wings.   Price was pretty average.  I would come back if in the area but will not go out of way to come here."}
{"text":"Chicken was good but the service was bad...the skinny Korean server was extremely rude to us from onset while we took a bit of time to wait for our friend to arrive (5 mins after we were seated). Then he came over to take the order after my friend arrived while we were busy catching up so asked for a few more minutes. That's when he gave us an attitude and decided not to respond or talk to us while taking the order. The service got a bit better after we ordered a few rounds of premium beers. Will never return coz the service does not justify the price point."}
{"text":"Starving at 9:30 on a Sunday night, I decided to take a walk around the neighborhood and no sooner had I read \"Blazing Fire Chicken\" next to a photo stuck to the window, that my salivary glands and stomach conspired to have me walk right in. Dimly-lit place with mostly booths, TVs with Korean pop artists performing and a menu that's in Korean as much as in English. Good beginnings! Blazing Fire Chicken+fried rice to go... The menu's got a ton of info...apparently they \"salt, boil, roast and barbecue\" their \"various natural ingredients such as chicken and seafood\". Excuse me while I wipe the drool off the floor. OK, so long story short, the chicken was as advertised. Tender as heck, spicy for sure (I've had hotter, but by no means was this tame). Came with really good fried rice with roasted sesame sprinkled on top; not the junky fried rice at most Chinese places - this one had really good stickiness and texture. And a tiny bit of salad with a sweet dressing (I gotta find out more about it). Oh, and awesome value at $5.99...I'm definitely going back...lunch...tomorrow..."}
{"text":"A friend of mine who likes spicy food introduced me to this restaurant. I enjoyed the food, but the service was very unsatisfactory."}
{"text":"Fabulous chicken!! We got the half original and half garlic sauce chicken and an order of fried rice. All. Amazing! Even the pickled radish is a tasty addition. Honestly, the best fried chicken I've had in a long time. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Been going to this place since 2008 almost every other week, they were the only Korean fried chicken place in DT area and served good chicken. But, since the new owner took over this place 3~4 years ago it's been going down hill fast. Chickens were constantly undercooked or overcooked, never right. I still went because there is no other korean chicken place in the area but only once every month or so.   However, during my last visit the chicken was so horrible I have simply gave up on this place. Chicken was over fried to a point, it might as well have been chicken jerky and the coating was not standard Booldak style. There was overwhelming saltiness and curry powder to mask unfresh chicken but you can still smell and taste the chicken that gone bad.    Such a shame.   Now I have to drive 30 minutes up north to Willowdale to get my Korean fried chicken"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places for Korean fried chicken. The fried chicken here is juicy and tender with very light breading. They also offer a variety of flavours for the chicken but my favourite is still the original!   Unlike the typical Korean restaurant that serves banchan, they provide a salad and pickled radish instead. The picked radish really helps offset the heat if you ordered spicy chicken! I also love their egg soup, which is very soothing for the throat after eating fried chicken. They give a generous amount of seafood if you order the seafood version."}
{"text":"Delicious Korean fried chicken.  Home of Hot Taste offers more varieties than other KFC places in the area, and the quality is better as well.  Great crunch on the chicken, and the heat is amazing!  Convenient parking, and lots of seating inside."}
{"text":"First time here with a group of 10. Actually there's not much of a difference between usual wing places and this place. But they have an asian twist on the flavours, as well as korean dishes like soups and kimchi fried rice. We ordered two whole chicken and two half. Green onion, original, spicy and sweet and sour. Also ordered kimchi fried rice and egg soup. I'd say skip the original and try the green onion, they are basically the same chicken but one has onion toppings.  I like the sweet and sour the most, the spicy one is good too! You can definitely feel the flame but its not umbearable. Also the KFCs are not as oily as the actual KFC chicken.  However the kimchi fried rice is on the oily side.  Egg soup is average.  Only down side is beer does not come with a pitcher.you can only order individual bottles of beer which costs $3-4.   Its a small store but overall i enjoyed my dinner over there, probably will visit again."}
{"text":"Close to where I live, this place has yet to deceive. The food is great for the price and the service has always been friendly and timely.   Don't go looking for a big selection in the menu. There are a lot of variations of the blazing fire chicken. However, I have yet to regret any of my orders.      The setting is typical of the many Korean bars/restaurant around the area. Dimly lit with booths that fit 4~6. It would not be possible to get an arrangement for a party larger than 8.   I would recommend the kimchi fried rice with oysters."}
{"text":"The service is horrible and slow, and the food is not fresh. The chicken is dry and too sweet, and the floor is so dirty. I would never go to this place again! If you want some fired chicken just go to KFC....."}
{"text":"I love their chicken and cheese. There's just plenty of heat in the sauce but not so much that it overpowers the other flavours. The spicy wings are equally delicious."}
{"text":"I love spicy food and this is one of my favourite go-to places for that delicious zing. Nothing satisfies my cravings like a nice hot plate of dukbokki (spicy Korean rice cakes). Of all the dukbokki I've tried in various Korean restaurants, the ones at Home of Hot Taste are hands down the best. The spicy sauce has a very distinct aroma, with onion, a hint of anchovies, and topped with fragrant sesame seeds. I've made various attempts to replicate it but I could not achieve the same level of deliciousness. All that spicy, chewy goodness, mmm mmm mmm!  OK so this is mainly supposed to be a chicken place and they're pretty famous for their chicken so I guess I should talk about the chicken too. I alternate between the fire chicken with cheese, or just the blazing fire chicken. The chicken here is very tender and juicy, and it has a unique smoky taste.   The side dishes here include a salad and a dish of pickled turnips. I usually leave those alone lol.   As for the service, they are very courteous but not very attentive. It takes a while trying to get their attention, and it's almost impossible to get their attention when the place gets busier."}
{"text":"Under new management, this store sucks. I used to come a lot and really liked their fried chicken and pork bone soup. Under new management, they changed their menu. Now it seems like a Korean izakaya. I came at dinner time, asking can I still order the lunch special. I can pay extra for it. The answer was its only served for lunch time. Before, they put those rice dishes on lunch menu too. But if you pay extra, you can still get the rice dishes. And it's my second time here after they changed their menu, they still don't have any hot drinks. I have sour throat and cold, I can't drink any thing cold. Won't come again."}
{"text":"Table of 8 during a rather quiet time. We were all served at different times. The past person was served (blazing chicken) after three others had completely finished. Servers disappeared after taking the orders. Food was over the top spicy, but perhaps the name of the restaurant should be heeded.  Were not given any sort of compensation for the extended waits.  Food was below average (bone pieces in the nugget like chicken) but was very expensive.  Cross this of the return checklist."}
{"text":"This place has awesome chicken. Found out this place from a friend of mine and he said the fried chicken was really good. So, we ordered the fried boneless chicken with green onion on top and spicy chicken. Nice thing they do is that they give you some pickled radish to cleanse your pallet because eating fried chicken non-stop is kind of greasy. We also ordered egg soup which has a lot of eggs inside. I think I will come again with my friends."}
{"text":"Not for adult taste.  Had tearful chicken. Not that spicy and the seasoning wasn't all that tasty.  It's an OK place to go for a drink with some food but not a place to for a meal."}
{"text":"Food was good but customer service was terrible.  1. Side dish provided only when we asked.  2. Water was rude to tell us don't put plates to other table. According to the water said,\" when you finished, Don't put here.\" 3. Water offer only when we asked.  4. Plates were dirty."}
{"text":"Love the one in Thornhill. Chicken and cheap beer! Can't ask for anything better."}
{"text":"Just moved to Toronto, and in the midst of trying to get settled, eating the pork bone soup and the fire chicken reminded me of dinners at home. YUM."}
{"text":"I had mediocre pork bone soup at this restaurant. There are no assorted appetizers as often in other Korean restaurants. The pork bone soup is very cheap though, $6.99 for lunch."}
{"text":"It used to be a really delicious place, especially the popular teriyaki chicken. Family and friends often went... The owner has changed and maybe the guy hired some new people, but it's not as satisfying whatsoever. Would not recommend.   For instance, if you ask for spicy, you won't be able to taste anything BUT spicy."}
{"text":"Service wise it's great. Blazing chicken & pork & squid was fine, personally liked the blazing chicken & noodle better plus the noodle tasted delicious. While you might find better price for the food in north York area, it's still decent price for downtown"}
{"text":"Owner has very bad attitude. Fried chicken is ok but the oyster and pork pancake is horrible. Full of green onions and onions inside the pancake. Taste very bad. After we said the food is not we expected, owner does not take customer's opinion and said their food is the way it is in a very unpleasant way. I will never come back again."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for many years since they were located near Yonge and Bloor. Their chicken dishes are all pretty good - however, the place was lacking consistency towards the end of the Yonge and Bloor era. When the place changed to something else, I thought it made sense that they were out of business to be honest. It was a big surprise to see them in the Annex, and I was mostly happy for them.   I came to the new location a couple times already, and so far the quality has been very consistent. I'm giving them 4 stars because I'm still cautious about what my future experience is going to be, knowing that it was inconsistent with the previous location, and this location is just starting.   If you are a big fried chicken person, then this is definitely a place to check out. Though they are known for their spicy chicken dishes, I usually come here to enjoy their crispy, juicy friend chicken; it's honestly one of the best in the area!"}
{"text":"Having never heard of Korean Fried chicken, this event intrigued me.  There's not much in the way of ambience in this particular restaurant but it's also nothing to complain abut either.  We were a group of 8 and admittedly we took awhile to get all our orders together, but service was quite quick in taking our orders.  Complimentary \"salads\" we're quickly brought out.  I don't know if I would really call it a salad though as it was iceberg lettuce covered in a dressing.  A few people picked at the salads but I don't think they were really that enjoyable.  Everyone's food arrived at different times which was a bit weird.  Some had to wait quite awhile to get their food.  Really enjoyed the kimchi fried rice, and the wings were okay as well.  I don't know if i would go out of my way to seek out KFC any time soon, but it was a nice experience.  Service was quite slow after our food arrived and so asking for more napkins or an additional beverage wasn't really easy.  The food was good, but service could have been better."}
{"text":"Service was not good, needs to be improved.  Didn't see any happy face on waiters & waitress.  Looks like they all feel unfortunate to work for the restaurant & customers !!  Tried the sweet & sour fried chicken, Fried rice. Great taste."}
{"text":"Perfect deep fried chicken with a lot of green onions!! Yummy!! Spicy oyster and kimchi fried rice is a good portion for 2. Perfect with beers!! There maybe lineups for weekends."}
{"text":"The service is the worst in Toronto. I wait for 40mins for only one dish. Suck.  Finally, I see hair in the food. I paid, and left. I will never come here again.  By the way the service is suck"}
{"text":"The food itself was ok, but the service was horrible. It seemed like we were ignored because we weren't Korean. Towards the end of our meal, I realized that we weren't even offered any water while every other table had a bottle... what kind of restaurant doesn't offer water? The waiters ignored our table and I had to walk up to the front to pay the bill. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Home of Hot! Home of Hot! Home of Hot! The Korean server boys are so friendly here, even to non-Koreans. I think they could all be K-Pop stars with their charm. They sure make this customer smile.  I really can't count how many times I've turned to HOHT for last-minute-lazy-undergrad dinners and late-night Korean cravings but I usually always leave quite satisfied. Their all day \"lunch\" menu is always cheap, providing filling, comfort food from 5.99$. Recommendable items are the Blazing Fire Chicken (signature dish!), the Pork Bone Soup and the Kimchi Oyster Fried Rice.  Last weekend, I visited them again - this time not for a Korean Kraving, but to get shmammered. When we politely asked if any of the bright neon Korean signs on the walls meant DRINKING SPECIAL, the sweet K-pop server so kindly knelt down by our table and sheepishly explained they don't really do deals because their drinks are already cheap. Aww. So true too. Their domestic and imports are cheap ($3 and $3.50) and bottles of Soju for $12.    If you are looking for beer and kimchi, they don't give you an option to order kimchi on its own. So give their blazing fire chicken a try with your beer. It's a match made in Korea!  Atmosphere - 3/5 (interior is all black pretty much) Service - 5/5 Food - 4/5 Price - 5/5"}
{"text":"I have visited home of hot taste many times over the past few years and have never been disappointed! We usually get the blazing fire chicken along with chicken wings and beer. Prices for bottled beer is under $4 with a large selection including hite, heneiken, Stella, and more. Will continue to visit home of hot taste in the future!"}
{"text":"Been here couple of times to give it a fair review. Poor service (and a bit odd too - they gave chopsticks to my colleague who was Asian, but a fork to me.. hmm) and okay food. The place definitely seems \"authentic\" with colourful decor and loud TVs, language barrier and signs in Korean. I'd try some place else.."}
{"text":"Do NOT purchase the regularly priced options.   $15-20 for portions of that size and quality? Get real, guys.  The only sensible option is to order one of the lunch/dinner specials, where every dish ranges from $5-7.     You're better off going to Yummy BBQ a little further south on Yonge.   The service, food and value are all much better."}
{"text":"The food and the service is really good, I LOVE their fried chicken wings! Pork bone soup is good, but with no veggies...this is really a turnoff. Also the sea food rice soup is not fresh. The waiting time is really long! If improve on some food quality and the waiting time, I would rate 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for lunch the other day.  There were good lunch specials on the menu, but we shared regular orders of Korean fried chicken instead.  We tried two flavours - soy garlic and spicy.  The chicken was fresh and hot, and both sauces were very good.  My only disappointment was that the chicken was not crispy or crunchy, something that I hear the Korean fried chicken in NYC and elsewhere achieves.    We also shared a Fusion Fried Egg.  This was a large, neatly rolled omelette slathered in sweet mayo and red pepper sauce.  The inside contained green onion, peppers, and kimchi.  Very interesting and tasty.  The place was very dark inside, but there were a lot of Korean people eating there.  Service was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I tried this place with hopes of trying some special Korean Fried Chicken.  On a sign outside it says they fry their chicken twice. Cool was looking forward to it.  So I ordered a large order of wings (20 pieces) with sweet and hot sauce and a beer  (Turborg Green).   Verdict: Dry tasting flavourless chicken despite the coating of sauce. I'm not sure why. Guessing because its fried twice over?  Or perhaps it's getting boiled before hand?  There was no flavour coming from the meat - it all from the sauce.   The sauce is interesting though. It has a unique sweet and hot chili flavour which is a contrast to most North American hot sauces which all taste like Franks Red Hot or Tabasco.   Served with a side of salad and pickled radish."}
{"text":"it was just \"meh\". shared the teriyaki fried chicken wings and they were ok. got the large size between us but were still hungry so we ordered the fried chicken with green onions. again, it was ok.   friendly service, if a little inattentive.  overall, i won't be going back."}
{"text":"I had some amazing scallions and friend chicken here last night. The chicken was fried so well and moist and the sauce was perfect. Excellent to go with magkeoli. Yum!"}
{"text":"I should have checked yelp before coming here! I unfortunately didn't order the fried chicken but the pork bone soup and blazing chicken and it was all just okay. I like that the resto is full of Koreans so I know something must be Authentic here! The prices are great and the food isn't bad."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible, terrible service.   We came to this restaurant at 615pm. Ordered by 620pm. We ordered 2 small orders of chicken wings - garlic soy and mild sauce.   The first set of \"wings\" arrived at around 640pm. I say \"wings\" because we didn't receive wings but rather half a chicken. There were obvious chicken breast and thighs in the order. No wing in sight. When I brought this up to the attention of the wait staff, they insisted that it was wings. I raised it 2 times and they said it was wings.   OK fine. Along comes the second set of wings that were proper wings. I asked the staff, if the second order was wings, are you sure the first order are wings?  They took the first set and said they'd check with the kitchen staff.  The wait staff comes back and says the first order was half chicken and that I ordered half chicken. Wtf.   At this point, I'm about to lose it. First because they tried to lie and pass the half chicken as wings when it wasn't, and second to try to pass the blame on me that I ordered half a chicken.   So they said they were making the wings order. We followed up 3 times and they said it was coming. It hasn't arrived by 730 so we asked for the bill.   When we were paying, the, what seemed like a manager, apologized. And I explained to him how long we waited. He tried to apologize giving a key chain to us. Why not apologize by giving us our food!  I also explained that our party was still hungry and need to go elsewhere.   The food that we did receive was decent but don't think it makes up for the terrible, terrible service."}
{"text":"Really great fried chicken and cheap beer - would definitely come again! The chicken was lightly battered, wasn't over seasoned and was very fresh! The oyster Kimchi fried rice was also really good."}
{"text":"The specialty dish is called the Fire Blazing Chicken - we got this with cheese on top.  Because I like spicy food, this wasn't too spicy at all but Clara (who is sensitive to spicy food) had to chase this with cups of water!  The kimchi fried rice was yummy - just enough spices with a good rice to kimchi ratio.  The crushed seaweed paper sprinkled on top should be mixed around so that it's evenly distributed before you eat!  The Egg Soup is delicious and awesome as a side dish to the fire chicken dish.  It's soft and tasty!  It's also only $4.99 so I definitely recommend getting this with any dish you order.   The fried chicken with sweet & sour sauce was probably our favorite dish from the visit.  The skin was perfectly crispy and the inside was moist.  I kept wanting more and more of this!   The spicy rice cakes were ok - nothing special.  I felt that the rice cakes itself were not cooking enough and I prefer the to be chewy and soft.  There were some fish cakes on it as well but not enough on the dish as when it came out, it looked like they ate some before they brought it out to us.  All in all, The Home of Hot Taste provides you some spicy satisfaction and more at a good rage of price.  They also get busy on weekends at night as many people go there for soju and makguli (Korean Drinks)."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Home of Hot Taste Cuisine: Korean Location: Downtown Address: 710 Yonge Street Price Range: $10~15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4 Service: 4 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 4  Extra information:  * Specialize in Korean Chicken * Also known as Bul-Dak-Bon-Ga * Open for lunch (special)  Home of Hot Taste is one of very few Korean restaurants found on Yonge Street in Downtown area.  They don't have a flashy store front sign, nor do they have many reviews or even a menu online. I noticed this restaurant just because it was a Korean restaurant, otherwise- I feel like I could have just passed by it.  I went on a Sunday night around 7:30 and I was surprised to find it pretty busy. The restaurant was filled with International students in small-big groups. There were 2 servers working who were very friendly, but was too busy handling all the tables.  Their menu has pictures which is helpful in making decision in case you are not too familiar with their dishes.  They first served us simple salad (which were tasteless and cut a little too big) and pickled radishes for the fried chicken we ordered.  Ordered: Blazing Fire Chicken with Cheese 4/5  * Plate of blazing fire chicken with melted cheese on top for $15.99 * You may have guessed from it's name, it's suppose to be super spicy * It wasn't spicy at all! A little disappointing * Not a big portion for it's price * Melted cheese on top is suppose to balance out the spiciness * Sauce has smokey flavor * Chicken is boneless and the sauce is marinated into the meat  * Good eaten alone or with rice * Although it's served on a sizzling plate, the chicken cools down pretty fast * Usually eaten with the rice balls * Paired with Soju most of the time * You can ask for it to be extra spicy  Ordered: Special Rice Balls 5/5  * Plate of rice topped with cod roe, seaweed and sesame seed * They give you a plastic glove and you are suppose to mix everything together and make it into a ball * The rice is hot but it's kind of fun * It's simple and perfect to eat with something spicy  Ordered: Spicy Sauce Fried Chicken 5/5  * Fried Chicken in Sweet & Hot Sauce for $8.99 * Known as one of the best late night eats back in Korea (with ice cold beer) * It comes with ~8 pieces of bone-in chicken (2 legs) * Sauce was perfect between sweet and spicy sauce * Had good sticky consistency for the sauce * Batter was crispy and hot which means the chicken is freshly deep fried * This had good portion for it's price * You can order Small/Large and just Wings if you like * I ordered regular small but would order just the wings next time * They are smaller pieces which makes it easier to eat * Good with the white radish to cleanse palette in between  When I saw my bill, I realized they had canned soda only for a dollar (which is rare these days even in Pizza joints) which I was plesantly surprised about.  Summary: Home of Hot Taste is perfect if you want to drop by for beer and chicken.  Depending on what you crave (beer or soju), they can cater to both. I am glad I found this place, I see myself visiting this place quite often!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken is delicious here and it's a fun place. I like how they give you gloves to eat the sushi rice. Ambience could be a bit better though"}
{"text":"Looking for a Korean fried chicken place in the GTA? Home of Hot Taste is one of the very few.   Decided to go here after a craving for Korean chicken. I ordered the blazing fire chicken with Korean noodles and the boneless fried chicken with herb salt.   The blazing fried chicken is pretty good, but not amazing. I like the noodles, the flavor but the chicken leaves a bit to be desired and the sauce is definitely not blazing hot. The boneless fried chicken was pretty good but not really unique. It was kind of like fried chicken with a side of salt.   The inside of the restaurant kind of reminds be of a Ktown bar. The service was what you'd typically experience at a Korean restaurant -  one server that takes your order, brings your food but needs to be waived down for service.   Overall I'd recommend trying this place at least once, I'd definitely come back. But it's definitely no bon chon."}
{"text":"Ok so I've had fried chicken here and fried chicken there, but this fried chicken is simply awesome. I have walked by this place many times and never actually went in for food until a friend told me I had to try the Original fried chicken.  From the begining of my visit I was given the well known polite Korean greeting and seated right away. Seconds after sitting down we were given menus and water and the deciding began. We order a large original fried chicken, rice noodles with hot sauce, and egg soup.  At first I wasn't really fond of the idea of \"egg soup\" but WOW... This stuff is awesome and especially on a cold day. It comes out bubbling and steaming and its best to start into it right away while its hot and still bubbling. When you take a scoop of egg make sure you take some of the soup in the bottom. I find it a prefect way to start my dinner and warm up on a cold winter day.  The rice noodles with the spicy sauce is good but not a favorite. It is very good but I can only eat so many rice noodles.  Now my favorite Korean Fried Chicken which I now just call KFC... My friends know when I say I'm craving KFC it means Korean and not Colonel Sander...lol.  The chicken comes out hot enough that its hard to hold on to yet you do it anyways and rip off small pieces just because it's sooo good. It comes with a dish of salt that you can sprinkle on top which makes it even more amazing. I usually ask for a bit more salt as they only give you a small amount in the begining.  The thing I enjoy most about this chicken is it comes in different chunks and pieces instead of wings or drums. Because the chicken is in chunks the meat just pulls off the bone with ease.  Another awesome thing about this chicken is that its not greasy... It's lightly battered, and sooo juicy.  I highly recommend a visit to this place if you enjoy crispy, tender, juicy chicken."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, the server was so cute and friendly. The prices were so cheap (maybe I'm just not used to Toronto cheapness) and the food was yummy, although not that spicy.  I shared the pork bone soup and the kimchi oyster fried rice.  All in all it came up to $16 without tip, not to shabby, eh?  I have a feeling this restaurant is pretty authentically korean. Why? Um...the name- home of hot taste? lol ...Cuz the specials are all written in korean without any english on the walls and the place is not located in korean town. Plus all the other guests were korean (or at least it seemed like that to me)."}
{"text":"We used to love this place but I think there was a recent change in ownership because we've been there a few times and the chicken tastes old. After eating the wings and chicken, we had a hard time digesting the chicken and they left bad after tastes in our mouths."}
{"text":"Came across this restaurant online and was attracted by the good reviews. Our first visit here was about 4 years ago and it's been our go-to ever since! We've brought so many friends here and got to know the waiters as well. Just thought we should come and drop an awesome review to thank them for maintaining the high food and service standard.  IF YOU'RE WONDERING IF THIS IS A RESTAURANT WORTHY OF YOUR VISIT, think no more - it is!  The food is always amazing and the taste is consistently great. Even when the place is packed, the dishes pop out within a reasonable amount of time. If you want to visit during a Friday night, get there before 7:30pm or you'll be waiting in line feeling envious of those who have already gotten their table.  The service is amazing. These guys don't usually write things down but never messes up your order! The staff seem happy here too, there is a low staff turnover rate. The space is a little small considering how hard it is to get a table for a large party (6+) on busy nights. They have, however, redecorated and got a few more tables put in.  Basically...there's nothing bad to say about the place."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for the first time. Overpriced, underwhelming, late, room temperature. The spicy rice cakes ($11) didn't even fill half the takeout container. The fried chicken (original and mild $23.50) was soggy, greasy, and the mild chicken didn't have much sauce on it. Oh and there were only 10 pieces total. Maybe dining in is a bit better, but definitely don't order takeout or delivery."}
{"text":"I've heard lots of great things about this place, about how there's great food here and cute servers here... lol. I'll only comment on the food and whoever is reading this will have to see the servers for themselves.    In the order of my favorite of the night to less so:  1. Deep fried bones less chicken with green onion.  Felt lazy that night so went boneless.  Super moist and juicy on the inside. We had some friends who weren't into spicy so this was perfect for them.  1b. Oyster Kimchi Fried Rice. Couldn't decide whether I like this more or the boneless green onion chicken. This was soon yummy! I would definitely get this again and again  2. Spicy chicken with cheese. This packs a bit of a kick for those of us not too into spicy. I found that it did get cold pretty quickly and lost its glamour.   3. Seafood egg soup. It was tummy-warming  more egg than soup. If you wanted egg, this would be great for you."}
{"text":"This place is all about chicken & more chicken!   If you can't handle spicy hot food, you're gonna have a bad time here. Well, you could probably only eat plain fried chicken or the oyster fried rice, which has kimchi in it.   The prices are fairly low compared to other Korean places and that's why they're always packed! It's very loud inside, I had to really yell across the table to be heard.   The chicken is like KFC quality but covered in sauce of your choice. I thought the sweet sauce was a bit weird, but enjoyed the Blazing hot flavor! The oyster fried rice was also very good - there were actual pieces of oysters. As with most Korean restaurants, you can pair up your meal with soju (Korean wine?) as a combo. I hate soju, so didn't catch my interest.   Interesting fact:  There's always a waiter guarding the beer. I wonder what the consequences are when he leaves his post."}
{"text":"Feel like chicken tonight? Korean fried chicken?  I used to go to the Home of Hot Taste at Yonge and Steeles. I was surprised to see it downtown!  This is a chicken restaurant. If you are ordering other Korean dishes, you may be disappointed.  Blazing Tear Chicken: It's everything you'd expect from chicken called Blazing Tear Chicken.  It's freaking hot (but I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to spicy food).   So yummy (sniffle, tears), chomp.  So yummy (sniffle, tears).   You can ask them to make it hotter or more mild (they just give you more or less sauce).  Fried Chicken: I love fried chicken. The batter here is light and crispy. The chicken is tender and juicy. Rolling your chicken around in salt and pepper. Delicious!  If I don't want to trek to Ajuker, I'd come here. Good for Soju and a snack but not a place I'd got for a Korean dinner."}
{"text":"If you want spicy chicken, this is a great place to try. Crunch and super spicy (not for those who consider tabasco to be spicy). Great for late night snack or dinner.  Beers are also reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Not even a joke, this place was so good the first time .... I came back the next day!!  I've always been on the hunt for really really really great Korean fried chicken, and I think I found it!! Not wanting to travel anywhere without parking, I went to Home of Hot Taste which had very accommodating parking spots!  It's loud in there, but not Guu loud, it looks just like any other Korean eatery.  I was unsure what to expect but I knew that Korean fried chicken comes with pieces of the chicken. Not how we're used to at KFC with a drumstick, thigh etc But EVERY single part of the chicken! I think that's the fun of it, you don't know what piece you'll get!  The fiance and I got a half and half order of original and mild spicy. And holy jesus ... Our faces lit up! Amazing batter, well seasoned and the mild spicy sauce was extremely delicious! A little on the sweet side to be honest, but great nonetheless!!   We also got the oyster kimchi fried rice on the side, which my fiance claimed it's the best kimchi fried rice he's ever had. I beg to differ. It's not my number one pick for kimchi fried rice, but it's pretty damn close!   It's reasonably priced, so I have no complaints. The portions are a bit bigger than you expect!  If you're new to Korean fried chicken as I was, this would be a great place to start!! Writing this review is making my mouth water!"}
{"text":"It's been said that the Fry makes good Korean fried chicken, but let's say this place is so much better. Among all the amazing flavors they got, the garlic soy one appears to be everyone's favorite, but if you like something more crispy and dry, the original is highly recommended. In case of wishing to try more dishes (because they are soooo good), it's a great spot for group, either hanging out with friends or with family."}
{"text":"This place isn't the same as it was a few years ago. Also with all the new Korean chicken joints popping up, I'd have to say there are better. I give it 3 stars for the great service though"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a super late lunch. Clean restaurant, public pay parking around the corner. Their fried chicken alone is enough of a reason to come back!! I tried their lunch special chicken bento.   Very big portion for $9.99 you can definitely share the rice with two adults but I would recommend you to get more chicken because you won't want to share those. I wished the restaurant would give me some veges instead of all that rice even it is kimchi. Because it can be a bit oily... however this is a pub style restaurant do chances are you will order a beer or two.   Chicken and beer"}
{"text":"definitely a must try place... the name sounds absolutely ridiculous for a restaurant but this place gets packed and with good reason.  Wings are slightly cheaper than at pubs and the flavors are quite unique. Had some wings and the chicken with the cheese on a sizzling plate. While the food was not that outstanding by any means, just by having a different take on chicken wings makes me a fan.  Service was pretty decent too."}
{"text":"Really good blazing fire chicken with fried rice - so flavourful and good value.  Every time I come here, I get the Blazing Fire Chicken Fried Rice (under the Home of Hot Taste Specials) and it's delicious every time. I love the fried sticky rice with a strong sesame oil taste and the blazing fire chicken. It has so much flavour and it's a great portion. If you're STARVING, I would also recommend the Egg Soup or the Corn Cheese (really good).   I definitely plan on returning, as I have been for years!"}
{"text":"Yet another korean fried chicken place... They're all starting to taste the same at this point (still scrumptious though).   We had the blazing fire chicken  at the lowest heat level and oml, I couldn't handle it (lol never again would I challenge my heat tolerance level. It sure is the home of hot taste). Along with the chicken, we had sausages and tteok-bokki I believe. Both good as well.   The place is relatively small inside and nothing about it really stands out.   Will be sure to come back to try other chicken flavours though!"}
{"text":"Clarification: I have not yet tasted their spicy fried chicken.  Really like: They open 7 days a week till 2am! That's incredible.  I just dropped by for quick take out, beef on rice, nothing fried or spicy since I am nursing a cold and don't want to make it worse. The amount was quite small and I felt it could have sold for a couple bucks cheaper, or at least offer some sides to go along with it for that price. Taste was decent, not bad.   I am interested in going back for their specialty (spicy fried chicken) when my cold gets better!  For now, 3 stars, A-OK. I may update at a future date."}
{"text":"So crunchy and so spicy AT THE SAME TIME!  Stopped by Home of Hot Taste last night with my cousin. We ordered the Fried Chicken with Green Onion and the Chicken with mini octopus. The Chicken with mini octopus was pretty spicy which made it PERFECT with beer. :)  The Fried Chicken with Green Onion was a pretty big portion, however, it was only super crunchy right after it was brought out (-1 star)."}
{"text":"This place serves great tasting Korean chicken dishes.  I repeat - it ONLY has one kind of meat and its their specialty.   The dishes can be really REALLY spicy though so be prepared to sweat while your taste buds are in heaven.  Even the 1 pepper rating on their cheesy chicken dish was enough to make me perspire!  I've only been to this location, but my friends have stated repeatedly that this Hot Taste place is much better than the other ones around town."}
{"text":"Came here often because we live around here. Not your typical Korean restaurant, even though they do offer some typical dishes like porkbone soup. No banchan :(.  Good for the fried chicken,  both spicy and regular. Blazing fire chicken is great too and douboukki (actually really spicy though) ! Best thing is they open til 2am , perfect late night snack ~"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for Korean fried chicken because i work so close. For lunch i will grab the fried chicken with onion and green onion, its popcorn chicken with soygarlic sauce over the onions with enough to share(2-3 people). I have to order this with a bowl of rice but HOLY $3 for a bowl of steamed white rice seems pretty steep. The fried chicken is pretty awesome too, half and half is a good option because you can change it up from saucy to original so your taste buds don't get bored. The Teriyaki is actually good its not like the teriyaki that you are used to, but its still sweet and just right(just try it). The other flavors are good too, every time I go i like to change it up. I go during lunch or slow times so I have not had an issue with wait time. Great place for Korean Fried chicken, food is good but on the price to quality/quantity its a bit over priced ......$3 bowl of steamed rice Preposterous! but still I would come back and order it haha what am i gonna do bring my own rice."}
{"text":"I've been to this place to this Korean eatery several times.  This place is great if you like chicken.  I repeat chicken is what they serve and it's their specialty.  If you like chicken done in a variety of different styles which is mostly spicy, then this is the place.  The blazing chicken is good and and the fried chicken is very good with the different sauces.  What's great is that there are no bones!  However I have to say that the service blows.  I can tell by how the staff looked at us, they wanted to rush us out to make room for others.  I mean we are paying guests in your restaurant and we spent money and you want to rush us out.  Don't you want repeats?  We didn't even ask for our bill and they brought it to our table.  I don't remember seeing a time limit.  Wow.  Also since I had to pay with Visa, I had to walk up to their counter to use their credit card machine because they don't have a wireless model.  Yup the service and staff lost me.  Don't want to go back."}
{"text":"My friend drove me here on a reading break afternoon. TTC would bring you there since it's just a short walk North from Steeles and Yonge.   It was completely empty so we were the first customers at noon (but my friend said it gets super busy at dinner time). We got a booth...but it was kind of awkward to get the waiter's attention since it was walled off. There's an unique self-serve coffee machine which comes out in a little cup ready for you...but my friend said it tastes very diluted.  We ordered original and teriyaki sauce I believe as recommended by the waiter. There were all the different parts of the chicken like wings and thighs. I loved the original because no sauce took away from its crispy texture. I think the batter is better and less oily than other Western chain restaurants. The teriyaki...hmm...wasn't bad but I think it wasn't necessary. They also gave a small side dish of white radish to clean your palate in between but I liked it on its own too. What I loved most was this oyster soup I ordered! It really tasted like oysters and the soup base was perfectly spiced although a little spicy. Plus I don't know where else would serve this item!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here, you are missing out!!!! This place has the best fried chicken in the GTA, and I usually order this dish in other restaurants when I'm in Korea town (Yonge and Sheppard/Finch/Steeles). It is a bar restaurant, so do expect the place to be loud and busy. They do serve alcohol, but I feel like it's a bit overpriced compared to other Korean restaurants/bars. They have a bunch of large TVs, so I recommend going there if you want to check out a game with the boys, or just have awesome comfort food with your significant other.  I ordered the Sweet and Spicy Fried Chicken ($22) and the Oyster Rice Cake Soup ($10). I also added the Sticky Noodle ($5), that's comes as a side but plenty enough for two people!   What's good? - the chicken. Delicious..and addicting. The chicken was so soft, tender and juicy!!! The sauce was not as spicy as I'd like it to be but it was good and worked perfectly with the chicken. They have an abundance of other fried chicken dishes which you can order...actually they have a page full of it.  - service was fast, and they were all very helpful. - reasonably priced if you're going out with a group of friends. - the sticky noodles was super spicy, but it was a good spicy. Loved the texture of the noodles (chewy and thin).  What's bad? - does get busy, so it's better if you go a little earlier (6-7pm). But if you're lining up, you won't have to wait long.  Recommendation: yes!!!! I highly recommend this place. I plan on going there again with friends."}
{"text":"I have to give a star if I want to post a review. Heard nothing but raves on the original fried chicken at the uptown location. The food at this location is just about the worst meal I've had in a long time. The rice is overcooked and soft...the meats are cooked within an inch of their life and tough as old boots. I didn't really think it was possible to mess up kalbi. Anyway...order and eat here at your own risk"}
{"text":"Love this branch. I have been there countless times for its Pork Bone Soup. They usually offer 3 pork bones in a bowl and they are moderate spicy and very delicious. It is really cheap. I believe it is around $8 ~ $9 dollars. The first time I paid for the bill, I was like \"Holy. The content is worth its price.\" I also like their Blazing Chicken with Cheese. This is a bit expensive but usually you share this among friends which can average down the cost. Note, they do not offer side dishes such as potatoes, carrots etc. But I have no complain, I usually drink up half of the pork bone SOUP by the end of the meal. I don't recommend everyone to do that because it is very oily. Lol"}
{"text":"I came here again last night after 4 years and I'm  glad to say that their food still tastes just as good! There isn't an extensive menu as it is mainly a chicken place. I can't vouch for the fried stuff since my friends and I usually just go for the spicy rice cakes ($7.99) and signature fire chicken with cheese ($16.99).   Holy crap, the chicken is so tender! That's gotta be the first thing to notice when it goes into your mouth. You can still taste the flavour and seasoning despite the spiciness unlike some other places where you all you taste is just \"spicy stuff\". The rice cake wins for its spicy sweet sauce. Price is a little high for the size of the serving but the taste pays off I suppose.  The restaurant's very small and tables are pretty squished so it's probably not good for groups bigger than 6 or so. The waiters are rarely ever seen and when they are, they look pissed off as hell. It's a shame that they tend to give better service to diners who speak Korean. One star off for bad service."}
{"text":"Would've never considered this place myself, but heard a recommendation from a friend that their sweet and spicy chicken wings with fried rice and pickled radishes were a match made in haven. And let me tell you, it's totally true! Add a nice chilled beer to that and it's pure bliss! I just loved their chicken wings and their radish salad (in fact I liked the latter so much I ordered and extra large potion of it later). Unfortunately can't comment on anything else off their menu, since both times I went there I ordered the same stuff :P They are also closed on Sunday, which is a bummer, since I had really bad cravings yesterday..."}
{"text":"We had a mad craving for korean fried chicken today and it led us here. The place wasn't busy so we thought we would give it a try. We ordered the kimchi fried rice which was yummy and just enough spicy for me. I ordered the original crispy chicken half which includes rib and wing pieces of chicken. The skin was very crispy and not greasy. The teriyaki half chicken was a good choice too. I am definitely going here again and I have to try the sauced wings. The place was very clean and the service was great!"}
{"text":"This place is all about the chicken.  One of the best fried chickens I had to date.  The spicy chicken is amazing too. We usually order 3 of them to share.  The spicy chicken and susage one is good as well as the blazing fire with cheese.  The egg soup is also very tasty.  I can't wait to come back here again"}
{"text":"Was here on an evening for some Korean fried chicken. It was my first time having such a thing and I didn't EVEN KNOW such a thing existed!!! I have been living under a rock it seems but hellooooo Korean fried chicken! My friend recommended we eat here and that I try this place since it is one of the better places.  We ordered the garlic chicken and the green onion popcorn chicken and both tasted pretty decent. They were somewhat crispy and quite moist/juicy on the inside which was surprising as I guess I was expecting it to be drier because it was fried. That was definitely not the case. However, I did have an expectation that the popcorn chicken was similar to the Taiwanese salt and pepper popcorn chicken style but of course that wasn't the case. Thinking about it now, why did I think that when CLEARLY it's made by different people!! I mean Taiwanese vs. Korean...helloooo??? Anyway the food was not bad and came out in a timely manner. Although, for some reason it just wasn't comparable to western fried chicken like Popeyes for example. Ok, I KNOW it's KOREAN fried chicken and maybe I had high expectations but I really thought this may be a mind blowing wicked experience...did I expect too much people??? :T  It was busy when we got there but we still managed to get a table luckily. Busy can mean good right? Service was good too despite the number of tables they had to manage. Would I be back? Possibly...if I wanna try more Korean fried chicken but it really didn't give me that umph I was looking for."}
{"text":"Not as good as the Fry.  I ordered a large fried chicken with green onion to go, portion is smaller compare to that if the Fry.  Doesn't taste as crunchy either.  Disappointment!"}
{"text":"Tried to pork bone soup and the pork bone itself is pretty bad. The meat was day and tastes as if it's salted meat. The broth was okay"}
{"text":"Went to try their fried chicken, also had spicy chicken with cheese and a fish stew to go with. The food was good, I wish the shrimp was peeled in the soup, kind of a pain to pull it out with your hands and shell it without getting soup splashed. Also the spicy chicken is very spicy the first bite was all heat till I adjusted but I thought the chicken could have been trimmed better as I had more than a few knobbly bits. Service was a bit slow and it's hard to catch staffs attention from the side booth. Overall a decent place for fried chicken but nothing special."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been going to the one in Thornhill for quite some time and excited to see the new addition in k town. It's nicer than the one up north.  Food is delicious! The fried chicken isn't greasy at all and really clean tasting. Well-seasoned too."}
{"text":"I tried the home of hot-taste at throhill, it was very good. Especially their garlic soy  fried Chicken. Whereas I cannot find the same thing at this store, instead I ordered the honey garlic flavour. It was very sweet :$ I doubt if they are owned by the same owner, or one of them is actually a copy cat. At the end, I strongly recommend the store at thornhill location, if you really want to try some great Korean fried chicken. Probably will never come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Group of 8 made reservations to try their Korean Fried Chicken. Luckily, we all looked online ahead of time to make our picks. When we looked at the physical menu at the restaurant, we found the online version much easier; it had more pictures and no crossed out corrections, but not everything was available. The table was ready when we arrived though. Let's eat!   Once the whole group was ready, we ordered all at once. Being new to this venue, many of us had questions about spice level and size of orders, but the server was not able to give us an answer really. I got a small order of boneless, plain KFC and a bowl of Pork Bone Soup. Some ordered 1 dish some ordered 2. They definitely didn't all arrive at the same time. We got our first batch and the second batch didn't arrive for half an hour and not everyone got what they ordered. I've never had this happen in all of the restaurants I've been to. One late dish ok, but half? No effort to correct an error? Really?   The Pork Bone Soup was good, but it was mostly broth. There was only 1 piece of potato in it. I was sad. It was seasoned like Pork Bone Soup should be, but I wish it has been a bigger bowl so I could've had more veggies in with the giant bone. The KFC was alright. The order was a decent size. The batter was crisp, but not special. The chicken was juicy and tender. I expected it to be memorable, but it just wasn't.   Service was almost non-existent. You shouldn't have to flag down a server for everything and I mean everything, water, bills, etc. We waited for well over half an hour after receiving our bills for someone to take the payment, but it wasn't until we flagged down someone did they tell us that you had to pay at the back, no portable machine. That would've been nice to know when we got the bills.    They've got a lot of work to do!"}
{"text":"The food here used to be very good - the very spicy kimchi fried rice and blazing fire chicken combos were heavenly late-night chows. Unfortunately the portion sizes have shrunk to unacceptable portions (95% rice and 5% chicken on a plate????). Seafood udon soup and ramen soup (the cheap lunch/dinner combos) are still ok.   They have several TVs and Korean music shows all the time - so it's a pretty good place for snacks and beer with friends."}
{"text":"This was some incredible Korean fried chicken. Recommended to me by a Korean colleague as the original location to its sister downtown, and it lived up to the promise.  Lots of different chicken preparation options, but I'd recommend the original fried or one of the blazing chicken options. Don't worry! The blazing chicken is not too hot to enjoy -- no need to fear!  We tried the plain and garlic soy sauces plus a blazing dish. All were excellent. Note that the blazing chicken is not breaded like the fried, its just a sauce.  Skip the spicy noodles side. I ordered them just to try, but the texture didn't agree with me. Too chewy.  Service was fast as well, which was a plus because we were starving. We did arrive later, perhaps around 8pm. There was plenty of room.   Note that the music was quite loud, and at least while we were there was playing dance music. If you prefer a quiet conversation or have young children I would recommend finding somewhere else.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is just as good as their sister restaurant in Markam.   The place offers a variety of spicy korean dishes and a good number of fried dishes as well.  Make favourite is the fried chicken whole regular and sweet and sour.  I usually get one of each and it fills us up nicely as a group of 4.    The one thing that could be improved would be the service.  It took a while to get our server to get us water (you need it the food is hot!) along with the bill.  Overall I prefer the markam location, but this one is a decent alternative as well.  I would come back again."}
{"text":"Rating - 3.5/5.0  Whenever I have a craving for some spicy Korean chicken, this is the place that generally comes to mind. Given that my tolerance for spice has gone up since the last time I have been here which is quite a long while ago, I went with their spiciest option and got the tearly blazing fire chicken with cheese. The spiciness definitely progressed as you continue to eat it!"}
{"text":"Really good food though their blazing chicken is too spicy almost to the point of torture but it does taste good. The service is not very good they almost don't care about their customers. All in all I would recommend this place to people who want to hangout with there friends and are ok with spicy foods"}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few Korean Fried Chicken places, and I'd have to say this is my favorite so far.   There's quite a large variety of different chicken items to order... I tried both the spicy and non spicy, and preferred the non spicy (even though the spicy was good as well). In particular, the sweet and sour was really tasty. I'd recommend trying a variety, as they are all quite different. Chicken is cooked well (moist).   My only complaint is that some of the pieces have a fairly high bone & batter to meat ratio. I would've preferred if they used bigger (fatter) chickens. But this seems to be pretty common among most of the Korean chicken places.   It's pretty good value. One portion of chicken ($17) should be enough for 2 people.   Lots of parking"}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool. Ordered the side Bulgogi (which wasn't small...) and Special Steamed Rice (which they provide you a glove to mix it with... because it's rice with flying fish eggs and seaweed bits). Overall, the Bulgogi was fine (too many rice cakes in it though) and the rice was AMAZING. My boyfriend got the rice and the original fried chicken, but said he'd rather go to Popeyes for fried chicken. One of my friends got a meal that was listed as \"1 pepper hot\" and was dying from heat. It was much hotter than any of the other \"1 pepper hot\" meals and we believe it should have been listed as 3 instead of 1."}
{"text":"This place is great if you like spicy food and love fried chicken.  I was skeptical at first as I could barely eat any of our original order of appetizers.   The Spicy glass noodles were intense like a fire burning in hour mouth, same goes for the spicy grilled chicken.  The fried chicken however was delicious!   We tried both the regular flavor and the sweet and sour and they both tasted awesome!   Great seasoning and very crispy!   Overall the vibe was nice and the service was passable.   It took a little while to get water refills (we needed it with that spicy food!) and the food came out a little slow.  Overall love the fried chicken and the free milk tea machine was a nice bonus!"}
{"text":"Straight up delicious! Best Korean chicken I've had thus far and I've had a few.   Go to's: green onion fried chicken (make sure to ask for bone in, it's more tender and juicy) and the garlic and soy chicken.   Another plus, cheap beers!   Make sure you are willing to wait. The lineups get long,  but it's worth it.   5 stars if it was closer to my house :p"}
{"text":"Amazing Korean fried chicken! Super crispy skin and the inside is so juicy and tender. Loved how hot and spicy the dishes were, especially the blazing fire chicken  ratings would be much higher if service was faster. It was very difficult to get the server's attention - so ask for everything right from the start! All in all, a great place for spicy (fried) chicken"}
{"text":"I visited this place on a Friday night and the place was very busy. Hip Hop music on the speakers while the TV was on a Chinese News channel even though the place is owned by Koreans. The music was loud enough that it's hard to have a conversation while the tables are close to each other too. The place is not very big so get used to being cozy with strangers. This is a typical Korean bar/restaurant with a selection of fry chicken and other appetizers while drinking your favourite beverage. We ordered the oyster kimchi fried rice, the half and half fried chicken. One half was plain while the other was Soy Garlic Sauce. No complaints about the food with the oyster kimchi fried rice being extremely good. This place is similar to The Fry around the area. This place loses stars because of the price point and decor inside. Wait staff are too busy to be attentive."}
{"text":"Went last night because Korean fried chicken is a wonderful thing and just found about this place.  Place looks nice, smells good. Menu is pretty straightforward as well. Don't be off-put by the pricing, you actually get a lot of chicken for a half order! I was incredibly surprised!  Service was good as well, very quick and responsive and polite."}
{"text":"First time trying a Korean restaurant that wasn't KBBQ. The food here was pretty good - but it's more of a shareable dish place imo. I ordered the kimchi fried rice and shared the blazing chicken with cheese - which was delicious and a good combo!  The service was outstanding. They were kind, considerate, and everything was brought to us in a timely fashion.   Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to a friend who wants some good authentic Korean food with amazing service!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time because a friend suggested it. Nothing special in my opinion - based on my experience. Chicken and kimchi friend rice were quite dry and nothing special except that it's moderately spicy. Apparently the food is better not during rush hour so if interested, come either before or after dinner rush hour."}
{"text":"Blazing chicken, blazing good.  Small little shop but chicken is dope as fuhhhhhhhhh. So many types of fried chicken.  Like every other Korean restaurant you get side dishes to start,  but only a limited amount (salad and pickled radishes, no kimchi)  Portions of food are very reasonable and tastes great. Very flavourful and juicy chicken. Fried pork Cutlet is also delicious.  Servers are nice but seem a little quite / shy, but still excellent service.  Aside from that, fried chicken fried chicken fried Chicken."}
{"text":"Kimchee Fried Rice + Fishcake soup were really really good. Blazing Wings and Kalbi...skip  Glad to find a good kimchee fried rice place"}
{"text":"Okay, I have tried this place a few times to give it a chance since it is centrally located and quite accessible. Price-wise it's fairly inexpensive and as far as decor and vibe, well, it really feels very Korean, there are TVs playing korean music and they are open quite late and most of the clientele is definitely Asian with a large, percentage of actual Koreans. Although somewhat on the young side. So if you are over 30 then you could feel a tad old. It has that hole in the wall vibe since I have walked by this place for years and never seriously noticed.  The food is not bad, although I have found not very hot. Their pork-bone soup is alright, although they use peppercorn for their spice and sometimes I tasted the broth to be under done. Which is a huge no-no when the dish is named after the broth and the mean it should taste like.    The chicken is supposed to be good here and it is quite advertised both by people and their menu, however I had not tried it. Their cheap noodle soup is literally an instant noodle with more spices. My friend liked it but it was quite cheap.   Would I come back here? If I am desperate and need pork bone soup? Maybe.   Would I come back if I had a few friends and we were already in the neighbourhood and wanted some so-so Korean, maybe.   Would this place become my local Korean joint? No. I would still go to Korean town for that."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. This place is dark, not quite dingy but they do try to be hip with the lighting, dark decor and loud dubstep music.   The service is good. I'd say 4/5. The guys who served me were super nice and honest.   Food: 3/5 - I ordered the pork bone soup - $7.99 (or $6.99 for lunch). Because the credit/debit minimum was $10, instead of getting a $1.50 pop I opted to ordering kimchi fried rice to go. In total everything came up to a little over $20 including tip.  I got a little salad as an appetizer, rather than the dishes of appetizers you get from other Korean restaurants. I was pretty disappointed about that. The soup itself was super thick and very greasy. The pork was very dark (boiled too much?) which was a bit concerning to me, and the meat didn't \"melt off\" like other places I've been to. The soup usually comes with a huge chunk of potato and some vegetables and it was also stated in the menu. I literally got a few strands of vegetables and a 3/4\" cube of potato.......... That was disappointing. The stock itself was decent. I wouldn't say it was flavorful but rather it was salty.   The chicken kimchi fried rice was good. A bit greasy but good! I'd give it a 4/5. It would probably be a 5/5 if it was pork kimchi fried rice :D   Would I come back here? Eh... Maybe. It's really close to my gym and I'm a crazy pork bone soup phase so maybe... If I'm not feeling lazy, I'll stick to mom's Korean food on Bathurst and Bloor :)"}
{"text":"I used to come here often when I lived in the area and our go to were the fried chicken with green onion and egg soup. At my last visit we ordered the regular fried chicken, fried chicken with green onion and the seafood roasted rice soup. The seafood in the soup wasn't fresh, clearly frozen which made the whole thing off putting. I've had this many times in the past and enjoyed it, but I wouldn't order this again. The fried chicken with green onion was just average. I'm not sure if there wasn't enough sauce, but you could almost taste the flour in the batter of the chicken. It was completely bland. The regular fried chicken was delicious. The chicken was juicy and the batter was crispy and different from the batter of the chicken with green onion. I think going forward I would only order this and the egg soup."}
{"text":"I ordered the kimchi fried rice and it was alright. Just okay. It was labeled as having the lowest level of spice but I found it to be a little to spicy. And I'm usually someone who can handle quite a bit of spice. I guess that's what you should expect when dining at a restaurant called \"home of HOT TASTE\". There weren't too many options on the menu. They offer mainly chicken. The prices were a little steep but I would say that the portions were also pretty large. I couldn't finish what I ordered and ended up bringing the rest home. Overall, I found the experience to be just mediocre. Not sure if I would return."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go for food on a Friday night. Opens late. Plays kpop. Chicken in every flavour or spice. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"A Korean restaurant on a strip of Yonge street between Bloor and Wellesley.  It seems like restaurants in this area are going out of business at a really fast rate.  This restaurant is quite popular with young  Korean students.  On a Saturday night, this restaurant was packed, so the waiter was running around, and the service was a bit slow initially.  I ordered the pork bone soup for 7.99 and my friend ordered an egg drop soup at 4.99.  To begin we were brought a nice salad with a nice dressing to share.  Unlike most Korean restaurants, they do not give you any side dishes - a bit disappointing, but I've been here before, and knew what to expect.  The pork bone soup was quite good, albeit small - it came with three bones, and not a lot of soup.  But it was late and I wasn't that hungry.  The egg drop soup looked quite good and was very good for the price.  The waiter was very nice, and I'd come back if I were in the area.  I've never tried the chicken, which is what they are known for, but it's more expensive (around $15).  I just wish that this restaurant came with side dishes, then I'd probably give 4 stars."}
{"text":"Some friends of my really like this place so I decided to give a try on a Monday afternoon.  I ordered the blazing fire chicken(?) with cheese on it. They looked amazing and were absolutely flavourful!! LOVE the idea of putting CHEESE on it! BUT the chicken itself was SO DRRYYYYY! What a shame!  I would prob come to this place every week if the chicken was juicy.  There were only 2 tables at the time I visited, I waited 20 min for my chicken dish. The service was ok. I might be back to try the chicken wings some day, since they looked really good. Hope they are not too dry."}
{"text":"My second time having Korean fried chicken in Canada and *unffffff*, it just hits all the right spots and satisfies all those deep fried chicken cravings. Comparable to The Fry (the other place I've been to for KFC), this establishment truly changes the \"K\" and puts a nice Korean spin to your average Kentucky fried chicken. In exchange for a less salty batter, the fried chicken is often doused in a delicious Asian sauce such as soy sauce, hot sauce, or sweet and sour. If you want to go sauce-less, there's also a green onion option, which is actually my favourite one. It almost cheats your body into thinking you're having some \"greens\" with your indulgence. Hah, as if!"}
{"text":"Best korean fried chicken I've had so far. Had spicy chicken and fried rice, chicken was mildly spicy and had a nice BBQ taste to it. Rice was good, a little sticky, standard fare for korean fried rice. Good for soaking up the spice.   Had half spicy fried chicken. Very good, right amount of heat and sweetness. I don't eat much spicy food, so it's perfect for me. For those that want more hear, you can order extra hot sauce.   Beware of anything 3 chilies, it's very spicy."}
{"text":"Overall, a great place for some chicken.  We got the oyster fried rice, blazing chicken with octopus, and original Korean fried chicken. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of kimchi fried rice which meant I was a huge fan of the oyster fried rice. The blazing chicken was pretty good. It was served on a hot grill with kimchi and octopus chunks in a spicey sauce that had a hint of sweetness. Once more, it had the essence of kimchi so I wasn't a huge fan. The original korean fried chicken, on the other hand was really good. It was crispy on the outside and really tender on the inside, and for all those of you watching your weight it isn't too oily so another plus.   Next time I come, I will definitely try the new Korean fried chicken in soy sauce."}
{"text":"After seeing the fried chicken sign outside, we decided to come here. But, as always, I crave kimchi! So I got the kimchi fried rice with chicken ($12.99 before tax). And hmm, I noticed that there weren't visible chunks of chicken but it was only until my friend pointed out the shreds of chicken. They also added in mushrooms which I haven't had before but was interesting. I didn't think the kimchi fried rice was that amazing and I definitely had better. Maybe Home of Hot Taste's forte is in the fried chicken."}
{"text":"Went for a late dinner around 10/11pm!   Ordered the Boneless Chicken with Green Onion to share and it was pretty good. I still think The Fry is more worth it for the price though!"}
{"text":"Saw a picture of the spicy chicken on someone's instagram and was sold thru the image. I have been dying for some korean style fried chicken. Let me tell you, i wasnt disappointed whatsoever. Ordered the whole  spicy fried chicken for $18.99. Went with my buddy and we are both grown men who definitely can eat. However it was very hard to finish even though its tasted so great. Had lots leftover, but maybe due to the fact that Stella's were only $3.75 so i filled up my belly really fast with great beer."}
{"text":"Clean establishment with nicer quality cutlery. There's lots of seating, especially for groups. The lights are dimmed at night which is nice, and they do serve alcoholic drinks. The staff is also very nice and they come around a few times asking if everything is okay and if you want more radish. We ordered the blazing chicken fried rice. If you like sweet spicy food, this place is for you. However it does taste similar to something from bourbon street grill but more expensive. The fried rice is extremely oily. I know it's fried but I've never seen fried rice glisten so much. The fried chicken wings are also one of the most expensive I've seen. This is one of the more pricey Korean restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"A few pluses but many more minuses here.    I'll start with the pluses:  +I was able to make reservations for ahead of time  +not far from subway  +was able to get separate bills at large party table  Minuses:  -WAY too much sauce for chicken.  WAY too much is an understatement to the point that they might as well submerged the wings in a bowl of sauce and let us fish them out.  To me the key thing about KFC is the fact that the batter is LIGHT and CRISPY/CRUNCHY.  You completely lose all of that or it won't matter if the chicken is completely wet and surrounded by sauce for any length of time.  Every piece I grabbed was dripping sauce off of it.  -environment was not very comfortable.  I felt warm inside this place like we were eating outside or something.  AC goes a long way that or some fresh air if the night was nice enough.  It was too warm inside with no fresh or cool air at all.  -our server... where was/were he/them?  We had a large party and we had to flag them down for more water or other drinks.  With so much sauce you'd need napkins yes?  Somebody had to go up to the counter and ask for them.  Even wanting to pay and leave we had to ask them to come back and bring us the bills.    -NO wetnaps.  You serve some of the sauciest chicken I've ever witnessed in person and you don't have anything to help clean off?  I had to go to the restroom just to get unsticky and wash off.  -DID NOT give me what I had ordered.  I had ordered 2 dishes the first being chicken with green onion on top and the second being a large order of spicy chicken wings and received a large order of spicy whole chicken.  The server even knew it and and they made a mistake but was giving it to me as if they couldn't make wings instead.  I said I'd take it since I didn't want it to go to waste but I wasn't happy for them basically trying to persuade me to take something I didn't ask for.  -NO GARLIC SOY chicken at all.  The most confusing menu I've ever seen.  It's easier when you have photos like on their online website.  I had ordered off of that only to have the server tell me they don't have any garlic soy.  Strange and disappointing at the same time.  While the food was semi-OK the service was anything but.  My first dish I received which was the chicken with green onion on top in a lemon mustard sauce.  It was completely covered with onion so much I couldn't even see where the chicken was or how much chicken I actually had beneath.  I didn't count the pieces, I couldn't see them!  There was however a HUGE pool of sauce underneath which was so unappetizing to look at afterwards I actually had to cover it so I didn't have to see it.  The taste was good, but the chicken was in there somewhere, drowned in sauce.  My second dish which I had asked for was fried spicy chicken (large wing order).  Instead of bringing me what I had actually ordered the server brought a whole chicken (fried spicy) and told me they had made a mistake but was giving it to me as if it's ok to make such a mistake.  I had really wanted wings since I already had a whole fried chicken in the previous order.  I don't know what I was charged exactly.  I couldn't read the receipt because the line items were in Korean.    I left 55 dollars for a 45 dollar bill.  I wanted to tip properly but I have to say the service was not so on the ball, giving me what I didn't order wasn't cool and the overkill of the sauce really ruined it not to mention they didn't even have garlic soy which is what I really wanted to get.    If you're going to eat here I'd suggest either getting dry wings or specifically ask for your chicken to have sauce on the side.  They use too much sauce to the point that picking it up will cause it to drip.  I only ordered chicken and nothing else.  Chances are some of the other dishes especially rice or other things could be better.    Bottom line, way too much sauce, non attentive service, not very comfortable inside.  As far as KFC goes they aren't the worst I've had in the city but overkill on the sauce makes them a very close second to worst."}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner that turned out to be 3 hrs long! I've never tried Korean fried chicken before, and this place was near by and recommended to me. At about 5:20 pm, there was almost no one in the restaurant. We got seated at a booth. They have this wall thing that makes the booths even more private. Kind of weird, never seen that before but I don't mind it. The restaurant is quite clean.  I couldn't find the salt and pepper chicken when I went. Oh well.  The hot chicken with cheese on top was recommended to me by my cousin, so we got that ($18.99). You don't get to choose the size for this one. It had one chili pepper but was still quite spicy I think. It comes on a hot plate so the chicken stays hot for a long time! Very delicious and oily.  The dishes don't come with the typical Korean free appetizers. They gave us an iceberg salad to share and white pickled radishes I think. I read in previous reviews that this was to help with the spiciness. The salad had ice in it. I guess to keep it cold? Lol.  The waiter recommended us the Oyster kimchi fried rice ($8.99). This also came on a hot plate. The waiter said it was not that spicy but I thought it was pretty spicy. Not unbearable but I can eat spice so I was surprised. There was not much oyster but otherwise the taste was good.  We finished both plates but not the appetizer things. After tax, the bill for 2 people was ~ $30. I had a good time and food was pretty good but I don't have anything to compare to. Not a bad price - we ate a lot!"}
{"text":"Korean food is famous for certan spicy dishes. The fried chicken here is definitely one of them. Chicken is their specialty but if you want regular Korean dishes, they have those too. They have things like kimchi fried rice, pork bone soup etc. But if you come here, I feel that you should get their spicy chicken as not every Korean restaruant has it.   They have another location north of Yonge/Steeles and I've been there once. At the downtown location, we ordered Kimchi Fried Rice and spicy chicken with rice. Both were very good. Both were very delicious but not mind blowing. That's fine by me. At the Yonge/Steeles location, we had their blazing chicken. It was spicy and a real challenge to finish (in a good way). I didn't cry from eating it but I had to ask for more water a thousand times. Good stuff!  You may notice that they serve different side dishes from traditional Korean restaurants. Th white raddish is designed to help you neutralize the spicy taste. It works better than water.   Speaking about price. I find their lunch special menu items to be very good value. You can order the same dishes for dinner but about $1 more which is acceptable. The price of their famous fried chicken dishes is much less reasonable than their lunch menus but it's not terrible either. I recommend it because you can't get this flavor of chicken in regular Korean restaurants. But it's not something I'd regularly come back for."}
{"text":"I am writing a review not because of how awesome this place is, but because how sick it made me feel. The very first time I came here, I was thrilled and excited about all the different chicken they offer - sizzling chicken, fried chicken, boneless chicken...it all sounded so amazing. I got the chicken with onions. Didn't have a problem with it. I told myself I'd come back again and order their famous sizzling chicken. So the second time I came, which was yesterday, I finally ordered their sizzling chicken with the pork cutlet for $19.99. Today, I am feeling very sick and constantly going to the bathroom. I feel very uneasy and sweating profusely.   I think they handled their chicken wrong and maybe cooked it poorly. I never felt sick ever after going to  a restaurant.   The place didn't seem dirty. However,  our table was close to the washroom and I should note that every time the door opens, the washroom smell was so strong and pungent. That should have been a clue for me.  I think the restaurant really needs to cook their food properly and ensure that everything is handled with care and cleanliness. I'm not sure if I would ever come back again. I was so excited to come back from last time because I thought it was a different place to try. But after last night and now feeling so sick, I'm not sure if I would ever go again."}
{"text":"I think this place makes the best KFC (Korean Fried Chicken). There's quite a lot of competition in the area actually. The Fry is a major contender, and Ajuker Chicken is also in the area. Then there's Mom's Chicken at Gallery (Yonge/Steeles).   What makes Home of Hot Taste worth your time?   1) Selection: They have the widest selection of Korean Chicken. You can get basic fried chicken, sauce chicken, onion chicken etc, or you can go for the insanely hot Teary Hot Chicken. They also have chewy noodles with chicken. They even have seafood. If you want spicy chicken, this is THE place to go.   2) Spiciness: A lot of Korean restaurants seem to dumb down the spiciness to suit foreigner tastes. This place is one of the few places that seems to serve up authentic flavors with their special pepper sauces. Of course, if you can't handle spicy food, there are plenty of non-spicy options for you.  3) Price: KFC is not the cheapest thing there is in Korean food. But it's far from expensive. If you come here, you'll always need at least 2 people (unless you've been stranded on an island for 3 days and haven't eaten). One portion is going to be $17+ tax and it's good for 2 people. This price point is on par with the other places.  Chicken and beer is a very Korean thing. They have plenty of beer to choose from. Meet friends here. Grab some beers and chill while eating chicken. Good times!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Service not so much.  Had to make multiple requests for certain things.   Food is good especially if you like spicy food.  Price is a bit higher in my opinion then other Korean place i have been to. The appetizers were a salad and pickled radish.  Would have loved kimchi instead.  I would definitely come back for the food."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this location, only been here twice but both times portions came out small. The deokbokki that we ordered were quite watery. Go to the Thornhill location, they're way better!"}
{"text":"Home of Hot Taste is located in uptown Toronto (north of Steeles), and hands down they have the best KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) in town.  Initially, we went there out of curiosity and comments that others have made about this restaurant, but after the first visit, we know Home of Hot Taste will become one of our go to restaurants.    Here are a few shots of their menu.  Besides fried chicken, they also offer soup and other snacks like ddukbokki, Japanese pancakes, and deep fried pork cutlet with fries.  There are three levels of spiciness.   Since it was our first time here, we didn't know what to expect.  But knowing that Koreans have a higher tolerance of spicy food, their level one Spicy Fried Chicken should be good enough for us.  Cubicles are available at Home of Hot Taste, they are great for small parties of 2-4 people, as you get a sense of privacy.  Keep in mind, cubicles are usually filled up first, so make sure you go there early to grab those seats.  Pickled radish and lettuce are provided to ease the spicy food.  ATTENTION!  The Fish Cake Soup looks nothing like the picture in the menu.  The reason why we order the Fish Cake Soup was because the picture in the menu looked very appetizing, but turned out it is very ordinary.  Any one can make this easily at home.   We were hesitant to order the Spicy Ddokbokki because their spiciness level was classified as level three.  Luckily, the server said they would reduce the spiciness for us and we were very happy with it.  The ddokbokki was still very spicy, but we quite enjoy it.  Strong garlic taste with a tad of sweetness. Also, the rice cakes were chewy, yet not tough.  TADAA!  Fried Spicy Chicken!  It was the hottest chicken wings we have ever had in our entire life!  Even though it is very spicy, but it is very delicious and you just keep wanting to have more.  Besides spiciness you can also taste a little bit of sweetness.  It helps a little with balancing out the spiciness of the wings.  This level one Spicy Fried Chicken is already at the top of our line, we can only imagine eating the level three Blazing Fried Chicken. *sweat*  We would say the Oyster Kimchi Fried Rice was the highlight of the night.  It was filled with all the flavours you can possibly imagine - sweet, sour, spicy, and salty.   You don't often get to experience all these flavours in just a single spoonful of rice.  It was the best kimchi fried rice we had so far in Toronto.  Can't wait to go back and have more!! =9"}
{"text":"I'm gunna have to give this place a hard no. Been meaning to try it since it opened so we finally went last night and ordered what looks to be two of the more popular dishes, the fried boneless chicken with sweet sauce and the spicy chicken with cheese.  Hey, I will admit in photos the food looks absolutely amazing but when it comes to taste and quality it's a whole other ball game.   The cheese chicken has a weird musty taste like the quality of the chicken was so low that it actually tasted like it was on its way out. Sauce and cheese used to mask nasty pieces of dark brown chicken meat full of disgusting gristly bits that really ruin the experience.  Our napkins were full of gross cartilage bits we had to pick out while chewing. Cheese was bland and tasteless probably also very low quality. Honestly it was pretty disgusting.  So the fried boneless chicken with sweet sauce was a bit better on the flavour and texture scale cuz of the breading but mostly just too sweet, and again, weird chewy gristly bits that needed to be watched for and prevented any real enjoyment of the meal.  Korean side dishes included one sole plate of really sweet white pickled radish, and the 6$ plate of sticky noodles, honestly being the only saving grace of the meal, was just a small portion of noodles with a bit of red sauce on them. The food was really expensive too! Def not impressed.   TLDR: the food looks great in pictures but is actually made with the absolute lowest quality chicken cuts full of gristle. Home of Hot Taste? More like home of hot waste. Hard pass on this place for next time."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving Korean fried chicken this place always comes to mind. It's a small sized restaurant with 2 to 3 servers working. I've been here 2 to 3 three times now and I always order the same thing. The Fried Chicken with Green Onion. I'm usually not a fan of green onion, but the way the green onion complements the fried chicken is a little out of this world. The chicken is deep fried in small bite sized pieces and the fresh green onion sits on top. The strands of green onion are cool when you put them in your mouth so when you eat it with the fried chicken it creates a hot and cold effect in your mouth. There is a sauce that is lightly drizzled over this mountain of deliciousness, but there isn't a lot of it so that it doesn't overpower everything. I've tried a few of their other dishes before but they were mediocre as I can't handle spice too well. If you can tolerate spice, you should give their other flavours of chicken a try. I always find myself just going back for this one menu item and they never disappoint. I often have the urge to get take out so that I could bring the chicken home to enjoy, but one thing always crosses my mind, the chicken would probably get soggy overtime and the green onion strands wouldn't taste as cool and fresh anymore. So I recommend to always eat at the restaurant instead."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to me so I had pretty high expectations. However, I was a little disappointed by the food. I think this place is overpriced, the portions and flavour didn't deliver to match the price. I'll admit that the chicken was really juicy but in terms of flavour, it wasn't anything special.  Fried Chicken with Green Onion ($24.50) - very light season on the Chicken and subtle sauce on the green onions. The green onions were a good pairing but there's no wow factor in this dish that would make me order it again.  Fried Chicken with Five Flavours ($24) - the name is five flavours but I feel like there was a lack of flavour in the seasoning. We asked for hot sauce and dipped our chicken in it to add some flavour.  French Fries ($5) - good and crispy Pickled Radish ($1) - good for eating in between chickens but serving was so small. Would have been free at The Fry along with other side dishes."}
{"text":"this place is pretty awesome. it's located just north of steeles on yonge. giant parking lot. shares a plaza with lucky bbq and piggy's korean restaurant as well as a korean supermarket.   so this place is all about the kfc (korean fried chicken). the place is moderately sized. the service is relatively hit or miss. but it's all about the food here!  usually i come with a bunch of friends and share a couple chicks lol. So I've tried garlic soy, mild yangnyeom, original fry and lemon mustard padak (boneless). Their blazing fire chicken with cheese is also quite well known here but i prefer the fried chicken. one other thing that is a must try (as otherw have pointed out, is the oyster kimchi fried rice)  You can get half chicks or whole chicks. Overall, pretty good food, service on the more mediocre side and slightly above avg price for a full meal. But is it filling? hell yea, always!"}
{"text":"For some reason quality fried chicken is hard to find in the GTA. Well this place surely knows how to make fried chicken and they know it (as apparent from their posters). You can get a plain original recipe fried chicken or try it with sweet & sour sauce if you don't mind some sauce all over your mouth and hands.  I recommend Blazing chicken if you are looking for that \"hot taste\" and don't want fried chicken.  Place is clean. Staff are friendly but not very attentive. Prices are reasonable. Complimentary coffee from a coffee machine."}
{"text":"According to past yelp pictures and my friend, this place serves pork bone soup for 6.99 during lunch time. Walked in on a weekday around 12 and ended up finding the pork bone soup is 8.50 . There was only a table of 2 before I went in, and I still waited 20 minutes for my soup. Banchans(side dishes) are below average, and the soup is just meh. Also, this place doesn't take debit or credit for bill under $20, and i ended up paying $12 for a below-average pork bone soup. Avoid this place if in a hunt for affordable lunch places in Yorkville, you've gotten better options!"}
{"text":"This is another location of the chain Home of Hot Taste, serving up Korean style fried chicken, spicy chicken dishes, as well as some soups! This place is great and has got a lot of tables. Generally not too busy! the fried chicken has extremely crispy skin and their spicy fried chicken is a savoury spice so that you can enjoy it! When you order fried chicken, you can order it in SMALL (which is 10 wings), LARGE (which i assume is 20 wings), Half chicken, (cut up in to pieces, then fried) or a Full chicken. My favourite dish was the oyster kimchi fried rice.. for 6.99, you get a big portion of it topped with seaweed! So Good!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and had a similar experience. The service can be slow or quick. Waiting for the actual chicken can take ages as they make it fresh. The fried rice is a bit oily but overall pretty good.   The half and half chicken (half dry other half spicy sweet sauce) is a miracle in your mouth. My goodness that spicy sweet sauce is WAY too good. The wait in the end was worth it. The chicken itself is not cheap either.   Domestic beers at $3.50 which is just fantastic.   As far as K-Fried chicken places, this is definitely on par with most of them."}
{"text":"I tried their original deep fried chicken with a side of sea food dobuki. The food is alright, and the server is nice. The fried chicken is similar to Popeye's chicken, which is good taste but not what I expected for Korean deep fried chicken - I was hoping to get some juicy and tendon meat. The dobuki is also average to me. Nothing too special that worth to write - just same as other ordinary seafood dobuki.   Will I go back? maybe.. its not a bad place for fried chicken if you live around this area. But it's worthy if you need to travel far."}
{"text":"Their proportions varies... My friend who ordered the chicken and rice literally got 5 pieces of chicken.  I ordered their pork hot pepper soup,... It was really mushy, and not soup like at all.  And for a Korean place, their side dishes are really disappointing... It's just a salad."}
{"text":"For me, this place is better than The Fry. They have the usual KFC along with Blazing Fire Chicken for people who really love spicy chicken.  Kimchi fried rice and fusion fried egg were just alright.  They can improve on the side dishes offered (just lettuce and radish).  Lastly, beer for $3.25!"}
{"text":"This restaurant really delivered when it came to their Blazing Fire Chicken with cheese. So delicious, perfect amount of spice, good quality cuts of chicken. Their pickled radish side dish was also delicious. I'm thinking home made? We had to get 2 orders of it, along with a side of fries and a grapefruit soju and you've got yourself one heck of a meal. Having been let down by so many Korean restaurants in the area, this one definitely restored my faith. I will DEFINITELY be going back, and have already suggested it to friends and family."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very aptly named because it is definitely full of spicy food. now of course there is food that is not spicy and it is pretty good, but what it shines in is the food is actually done pretty well. creativity wise i wouldn't expect anything that is exceptionally different then other korean bars/restaurant, they do korean fried chicken, as well as a variety of other hot plated snacks and food. Overall the food is done very fresh and fast, and the price is pretty reasonably priced for most of the items. I would say its a great place to hang out with friends and catch a bite, which is probably why when i came here on a friday night it was packed. there is also a lunch special for people who are more interested in just trying food and not in the bar environment. the only thing place loses stars on is service. the food is pretty quick and good, but the service is so so, they are chronically understaffed it seems, and also on off hours i believe they don't place the best staff, as some are very inattentive and takes forever to get orders or checks. overall i would still recommend this place as the food is pretty good. but if you hate spicy food you might find it harder to find food that you want"}
{"text":"I had great Korean Fried Chicken in Seoul and was craving it after coming back home and my friend recommended this place. Although it's not exactly the same level, the Korean fried chicken here was pretty good. The most unique item I tried here was the fried chicken nuggets with slices of onion dressed with honey mustard. The chicken pieces were surprisingly very juicy and seasoned well. I would definitely come here again to eat this. Then I just got regular Korean fried chicken, Spicy Korean fried chicken, Garlic slices Soy Korean Fried chicken. The Spicy Korean fried chicken wasn't cooked the same as the one in Seoul as the sauce was wet on the chicken. It was dry spiced in Seoul which I kind of preferred. Not the biggest fan of wet sauced fried chicken. I'd definitely come here again for my Korean Fried chicken cravings. Their chicken are fried to perfect golden brown and the meat is very juicy."}
{"text":"A wise friend one told me, \"it will taste great but you'll feel the burn in the morning\". I have yet to see what he means...   Hot Taste KFC is definitely worth trying.  Is it upscale? No.  Is it exciting? No.  Are the servers Welcoming? Meh.  Is the food good? Pretty frogging great.   I ordered the flaming chicken (17.99)which was true to its name. It started out as nice heat and it got hotter as you eat it. The chicken was so tender and well seasoned. Notes of smokey and tangy.   Ordered the fried chicken with onions (18.99?). The chicken could be described as a lightly coated popeyes chicken cooked to perfection with the meat tender and succulent. The scallions they throw on top gives a sweet balance to the unexpectedly greasy dish.   Oyster kimchi fried rice (9.99). I don't think i had an oyster in my bite. Nevertheless, a solid kimchi fried rice, but I've had better.   Beer was fantasticly yet surprisingly cheap. $3.25 for domestic bottle. This is an amazing place to lounge with your friends after a long day.   4/5 because this joint needs to be more creative with their recipe. The chicken is a great foundation but I feel like they should experiment with more flavours. My suggestion, have a fried version with the flaming sauce."}
{"text":"I have a major complaint about this place because they are always out of oysters whenever I go, regardless of the time. There is about 3 dishes in there that I want to try which has oysters in it, and they always suggest to change it to chicken.  So this place only has chicken. The blazing chicken is pretty spicy but not too hot to handle. What's better is the fried chicken. Can't go wrong with the original fried chicken, it's not oily at all. Or try the ones with sauces, it's the place to go for those who like chicken. Boneless chicken, chicken wings, whole chicken or half chicken (cut into pieces)  There is only a salad and turnip as side dishes."}
{"text":"Tried the original chicken. It was so good! A little pricy but the taste make it worth it."}
{"text":"Loving Korean Fried Chicken.  Suffice it to say the only fried chicken Ill be ordering for a while will be will be the new 'KFC'  Tried a couple of other spots but this one is my favourite to date  Tried the original and the fried spicy and both are great  Found this place a few weeks ago and have been back every week since.   A must try for all fried chicken fans and if you love spice be sure to order at least a half of the spicy.   I suggest the whole half and half combo to get to sample the best of both worlds.  Enjoy everyone as 'KFC' slowly takes over the fried chicken scene.   Now please just make one in Woodbridge!"}
{"text":"Love everything I ve tried so far. Kimchi fried rice was my very first obsession, then seafood udon, rice soup, signature chicken, fried wings, and many more! Definitely a good place to go for late night snack. Attention: most dishes are very spicy tho. Need lots of iced water to calm me down. Lolll."}
{"text":"Summary: a wide variety of different flavours of chicken and fried chicken range from decent to good, but seating is cramped... high fees means low value, but is fun for sharing among big groups  Top Must-Get: fried chicken with green onions Top Regret: Spicy Chicken (unless you like cinnamon!)  We popped by here for a small birthday celebration? with a group of 8 around 6 pm on a Sunday. About one third of the seats were full, but it steadily got busier - by 7:30, it was packed.   Our food started coming about 15 minutes after our order, starting with the spicy squid... And true to it's name, this has some kick: my friends complained they could barely feel their tongue after.  The spicy chicken? Not nearly as much. The chicken was spicy, yes, but it was also very, very sweet! I could see why some people might like it, but to me, the cinnamon flavour was a bit too much. *Too much cinnamon flavour  Snowing chicken is alright. Not sure if real cheese is used or not, but it's got a subtle-ish taste (relative to the flavour packing spicy chicken). *Not enough cheese flavour  Next the garlic soy chicken. Now, I LOVE garlic, especially in choi (Asian veggies), but holy over-seasoning, they use a TON of garlic. I think it really takes away from the chicken taste. *Too much garlic flavour  The next was the chicken with green onions, although I personally don't think it had enough of a \"fresh\" onion smell - the fried chickenness flavour was strong here. But, bonus points for no bones! *Not enough onion flavour  The egg soup tasted like typical steam egg - but is good for alleviating the spicy kick. Pretty plain, but does what it's supposed to.  Now, the original fried chicken. That had a revelation: they give you salt (sea salt and pepper) ON THE SIDE! After the inconsistency of the seasoning, this was a blessing. Funny thing is, the original is probably the best here. It's like a crunchy, not-that-oily version of KFC.   All in all, fun to try all the flavours, but at $20+ for a full chicken, it's not great value at all.    RANDOM NOTES: The TV plays movie trailers with French titles on repeat. So if you like watching clips of \"la conjuration\"... This is your spot.  The washrooms are really small. One stall and an awkwardly placed urinal in the men's, and apparently just one stall.  Service is fun! They added a sparkly birthday candle to our cake out of the blue. I think it was the owner. That brings it up from a 2.5 to a 3! (Although they forgot to refill water a lot)."}
{"text":"This is a good choice in the winter time for a group of friends. Weekday nights are not too busy. One of their overhead TVs was showing TVB/HK drama despite it being a Korean spicy chicken place. =P  -Blazing Fire Chicken with Cheese ($20.80) - not too spicy because of the cheese -Oyster Kimchi Fried Rice [**VFM Item**] ($9.99) - it taste good but it's oily! -Fried Chicken with Garlic Soy Sauce Large ($19.47) - My personal favorite  -Fried Spicy Chicken Large ($19.47) - it taste of some kind of spice that I'm not too fond of. It's more sweet than spicy"}
{"text":"Ordered Fried Rice and Blazing Chicken. I would say this place is good for small groups as the prices on the steeper side and good for sharing. Personally I thought there was limited options on the menu for singular dishes. The service was standard, pretty mediocre and the food was good. Don't know if I would go back?"}
{"text":"Not my fave.   We got a large plate of sizzling chicken sans cheese - kind of tasteless. :( It felt like a really simple dish that I could have made myself. the flavors weren't there.  Slow service, one waitress tried to woman the floor on a friday night. poor girl."}
{"text":"Leaning towards a 2.5 but I was not amazed by HOHT.   Walked in on a sunday evening and it was pretty silent. Couldn't spot one worker in sight for a few minutes until one emerged out and directed us into a booth. Now, I like how private the booths and tables are- with large partitions between each one, now I don't need to witness other hungry families!   The menu is ALL chicken and meats. Ok ok, that's expected but at least have a bigger variety of apps? We got a whole fried original chicken, which was good but not spectacular.. it came with a little place of pepper salt and that was that. Also ordered the grilled sausage platter, which was not good. Way too salty and I ate two bites of 2 different sausages and I was done with that plate. Also, the bottom was covered with oil- what a mess! Needless to say, my stomach was not feeling the best after all the fried messiness. The sausage platter said it's assorted but it kind of looked and tasted the same to me? Okay?   Service was barely existent and it was hell trying to flag down a waiter to pay/get water/get service. They need bells.   Overall, meh. I don't see a need to come back."}
{"text":"One of the worst Korean Places I've ever been to. Took 5 minutes to get a seat from the single waitress who worked there. My cup came with a complementary moth on the side! Absolutely disgusting. Was given only one side dish (better than nothing I guess). As for the actual meal, I ordered the lunch menu and it was basically fried rice with some tiny chicken wings on the side. Not spicy or tasteful at all. Overall, one of the most disappointing places I've ever been too. Save your money and go to the Piggy place on the other side of the plaza."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and was extremely satisfied with the food my boyfriend and I ordered. We ordered the boneless chicken with the special sweet sauce and the oyster rice cake soup and I have to say- they were delicious! We also ordered their rice wine which I find was cute to drink in, they gave us these mini bucket bowls to drink from.  The good: The soup was not too salty and it was a good portion size although we did not finish the rice cake. The chicken was very flavourful and there was a lot between us to share. This was accompanied well with the rice wine.   The bad: this place usually gets busy around 8pm so it's definitely best to go a bit earlier however if you do go late, the wait time is not too bad.  Would I recommend this place? Yes! This place opens late (I think until 2 am) and it's a great place for you to enjoy with friends too since you can basically share everything. The food is awesome too!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the green onion boneless chicken. It was quite yummy and the cold green onions were a well-paired contrast to the hot crispy chicken. The kimchi egg omelette was a big portion and pretty yummy too. Definitely could be shared, unless that is all you are eating.   Just a word of warning, the spicy chicken is REALLY spicy. I didn't try any, but the friends I were with were chugging water like there was no tomorrow, and they have a normal tolerance for spice (certainly not the Korean tolerance though!)  Not much can be said for the decoration or ambiance, as it is pretty so-so but seating was spacious and comfortable. There is a lot of parking in the plaza, although it might not be directly outside of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here expecting similar fried chicken to the ones I had in Korea but it was anything but. I'm disappointed but maybe I just expected too much. Or perhaps we just ordered the wrong thing (probably).   We went with Makgeolli (Korean rice wine, I recommend that) with a full order of boneless green onion chicken bites with the soy mustard and lemon mustard sauces. Do not order this even if you like green onions. The chicken bites were way too light and weren't crispy at all. They were greaseless, well, that may be a good thing but not the expense of  crunch-less fried chicken. Also the bites were essentially devoid of the sauces, but the sauces weren't anything special anyways - as they just weren't very balanced between sour, sweetness, and umami. All this makes for crunch-less, taste-less fried chicken. However, the chicken bites were tender.   I would have liked my bites to be entirely coated like they were in Korea and I'd also really like to try the more popular spicy and soy garlic sauces next time. That what we should have gotten in the first place.  The service wasn't very pleasant. The staff here worked as if they didn't care, or wanted to be there, which just detracts from the overall experience.   I do believe in second chances and love KFC so I'll definitely come back and try their wings next time."}
{"text":"Their chicken was very delicious and spicy good. Especially the fire blazing chicken with cheese on level 1 spicy (still mouth burning spicy - warning). Definitely recommend to eat out with friends if you are craving chicken."}
{"text":"First time here.  Ordered: Blazing fire bento - food server said it was hot. If you are used to hot Indian food, this is not as hot and you will be fine. Otherwise you will need a fire truck to douse you with water :) they're wings so not very large and might be enough for one hungry guy. Fried rice was a WOW.   On my last bite, got too much hot sauce in... wow that was hot. Water helped though some say it makes it worst and need milk instead.   Pork cutlet rice - ok. Bleh but not bad  Seafood egg soup - well, egg tastes like... egg.  The way the soup blends in was quite good.   Udon - meets expectation for a Korean udon  Half half - fried chicken and garlic soy chicken - fried chicken? Popeyes seems better - garlic soy? Better than Popeyes. Garlic sweet taste goes very well."}
{"text":"First time here, ordered Spicy Pork lunch special. Heat level is good but the white rice seemed like overnight rice ~ kind of hard and I don't think its texture was due to the sizzling hot plate. Pork was a bit tough but paired well with the little dish of sweet pickled radish.  Service was good, place was very quiet during lunch time. Maybe people preferred to stay away from spicy foods on a hot day..."}
{"text":"My favourite Korean chicken place. period. (but to be fair I haven't been everywhere). The way they execute frying of the chicken is superb. Flavouring of the teriyaki sauce doesn't drench the chicken wing but complement it. The spicy hot sauce I think is gochujang is a little different from regular hot sauces from other American wing places (I don't like spicy foods , but find it still alright). My favourite chicken dish is the green onion chicken. The combo of the raw green onion gives a fresh burst compared to the fried chicken (doesn't get much better than that). I also recommend the fried rice, something about oily rice enhances the entire dish. Service is alright, and the TV always play entirely different things. If you want to try with no wait I recommend a regular weeknight since it seems to be packed on weekends."}
{"text":"The Original fried chicken is soooo good! Tastes really fresh and fried right when you order it.  So tasty! We also ordered the steamed chicken which was also so good! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is open late, and serves amazing, amazing Korean style comfort food. I have been 4 times already, and have finally tried every dish on their menu. There is not a single dish I don't find tasty. Their flavouring is spot on. The inside looks pretty run down, but the food is amazing. Definitely a good place for friends to sit down at night for some food and drinks."}
{"text":"It was late on a Friday night, and we were looking for a restaurant that was still open.  We found this place on Yelp and decided to check it out.  We ordered the spicy chicken with squid, with rice on the side (rice doesn't come with the dish).  It was delicious!  It was definitely on the spicy side, but as expected.  The side dishes here weren't that great for a Korean restaurant.  We only got a small salad, with hardly any dressing, and cold radishes  (no kimchi!).  I will be going back to try the fried chicken dishes."}
{"text":"I love their fried chicken as well as hot spicy chicken dishes. Their complimentary radish is a great pairing but I wish they provided salad like before - not sure why they took it away. Kimchi would also be a nice addition."}
{"text":"Holy can u say spicy! I got their signature dish with the chicken, glass noodles and rice cake. Adding a cheese is a must. I believe the dish was listed at 4 hot peppers symbols. I said less spicy, and it was still very spicy haha. Maybe I should specify to two next time. Regardless it was a good spicy and some steam rice to balance the chicken did it. The chicken and noodles were all very good. I also enjoy their late hours which is why we came here. Good spot to to come late at night."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Service: 2.5/5  Ordered half and half (green onion & onion). Light and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Green onions and onions were very fresh and marinated well with the sauce. All the menus come with complimentary salad and pickled radish. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the dish. We finished the whole chicken (could be enough for three small eaters with an order of side).  I would have to say service here is not the best. Probably the worst service I have gotten from Korean restaurants in GTA. They never came back to check up on us nor took away finished plates until we left. I would still come back to try different items on the menu despite the poor service because the fried chicken we had was too good.   You can pay with a credit card if your bills is more than $15. A big parking lot in the plaza.  Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to try authentic Korean fried chicken."}
{"text":"The short answer: this place was bad for food and service.  The explanation: We ordered kimchi fried rice and their sweet and spicy Korean fried chicken. The kimchi fried rice was very greasy and didn't actually have much kimchi in it. When we ordered the fried chicken, we were given the options of  bone-in or boneless. Thinking that bone-in meant dark meat that would be juicier, we went for that. Unfortunately, the chicken took forever to come. We had already eaten (at a very slow pace) the kimchi fried rice and were done for about 5 minutes before the chicken came - I thought they had forgotten the order or were in the back still plucking the feathers off a chicken. I mean, how long does it take to throw a bunch of chicken pieces in a deep fryer? Well, things didn't improve from there. The sauce was not spicy and was mainly sweet, not at all a complex set of flavours. And to my extreme disappointment, our basket of chicken contained all sorts of unidentifiable parts, white meat, and just two or three drumblets and wings. Many of these parts were inedible as they were all bone and the white meat was dry. All this for $18 (we ordered the large)?! I call it a rip off.  About their service: A man came in at one point, asking if he could take a booth. The waiter said that only two or more people could sit there. The restaurant was completely empty at the time, so it was unfair that the man couldn't sit anywhere he wanted. To further their ungraciousness, we asked for more napkins given the sticky fried chicken we were eating. They gave us exactly one extra napkin each. Stingy much? Finally, they were not attentive. I had to go to the counter to pay because they seemed to have forgotten us and didn't clear the table or bring the cheque."}
{"text":"Came here twice and the chicken is just okay... the powder cheese has got to be my least favourite dish. We got different sauces on the side tho so maybe that made it worse. Kinda overpriced. Wished I had gone to Popeyes instead."}
{"text":"Ordered wings with rice, and it was average. The place was empty on a Tuesday night. Nothing special about the food, would not come back."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to come here!! I love korean fried chicken and I've been wanting to come here for a while! We got the oyster kimchi fried rice and soy garlic wings, both were amazing. Especially the soy garlic wings, it was so garlic-ky I absolutely love it!! Will be back to try more food items for sure!"}
{"text":"Was craving korean fried chicken, did some research and came across this place in the heart of koreatown. The place was empty when we arrived. Usually a bad sign with regards to quality and taste of food but this is not the case.   Ordered the soy fried chicken and some other seafood noodle type dish. The chicken was done well. As for the seafood noodle dish, it lacked substance but it was really flavourful.   This is a korean fried chicken place so i recommend the chicken. Try the different varieties of chicken, the chicken is fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is great. I was hesitant to go due to some negative yelp reviews but this place was yummy. The tofu soup is delicious, as is the kimchee fried rice. The highlight of the meal was the Korean fried chicken with hot and sweet sauce..... Damn was it DELICIOUS! I don't like chicken and I gobbled this down (bf got it). My only complaint is that specials on the wall are all in Korean and our server took awhile to get our bill. I will be back. Ps: $3 domestic beer!"}
{"text":"Food was good, we had the blazing chicken ($20) and the seafood dduk bok ki and the egg soup ($10) it was a little pricy for the food we got. it's a new branch so inside is very clean and pleasant, the staff is nice. They should turn on more exciting Korean music though, lots of ballades that make me sad while eating chicken lol"}
{"text":"If you like spicy foods, this is the place to visit.   This is a typical casual Korean restaurant. The environment is loud which was expected for a Korean restaurant serving chicken and beer. Do expect this place to get busy on weeknights and weekends.   Their service was horrible. You have to wave down someone to get something. They will never check up on your table since they provide every table with a jug of water, so there is no need for them to check frequently if you need water. But you will need to wave someone down for ordering, or if you need anything else.   Food: I ordered their signature blazing fire chicken with cheese. It only had \"1 flame\" for their spice rating, but it was veryyyy spicy. I can take some spicy normally, but this was just way too spicy for me. The cheese on top made the food a little less spicy though. The chicken was flavorful and the prices here are decent. Their portions are great for the size.  I like this place for some casual chicken and beer. Nothing was over the top. I would recommend coming here for some decent food and beer at decent prices."}
{"text":"Was a initially a little put off by the interior and the decor of the restaurant.   Place reminded me of an overcrowded bar and the washrooms were tiny.  Wasn't expecting too much in terms of food quality, but boy was I wrong!   As it was my first time here, I decided to try the original fried chicken as recommended by a yelper.  I ended up splitting the half original fried chicken and half garlic soy chicken with a friend.  The original fried chicken reminded me of KFC, only with much less grease.  The garlic soy chicken was also excellent; it had a subtle sweetness that reminded me of a honey garlic chicken wing.    Consistency was slightly questionable, however.  Some of the meat was extremely juicy while there were some overly dry pieces in our basket.  Service was also a bit slow at times, but was definitely impressed by the food here.  Will probably come back soon!"}
{"text":"Chicken wings with salt and pepper is pretty good. The wings are a little bit sweet and dipping it in the salt and pepper makes it taste good.  It's not too hot that 3 out of 4 times I went there, the credit card machine didn't work..."}
{"text":"I really love their buldak, by far they have the best in Toronto.  However:  The service here is really terrible. The servers look like they're in grieving at a funeral or something. They are so rude. Ruins the food for me to eat while watching these grown men wish we would all disappear."}
{"text":"Went there on a late Friday night, and the place is packed. We ordered the blazing fire chicken with cheese, oyster fried rice and the fusion egg. The chicken is tender and juicy, even it was pretty hot, the cheese kind of smooth that out. Fusion egg is like a huge Japanese egg sashimi with kimchi rolled inside and mayo all over it. Pretty cool. As for the oyster fried rice, it is like a treasure hunt, at the end we found 4 tiny small pieces of oysters. How lucky....."}
{"text":"Ordered fried chicken with green onion. Wanted bone in...when we picked it up it was boneless and they were unwilling to fix it.   Customer service non existent. Ill stick with the fry"}
{"text":"The feeling of the restaurant as you walk in is like a bar. Its a small place but there's TV around the place. They also have a big fridge that holds many types of beer, imported and domestic. Coors light, Budweiser, Asahi, corona, Heineken, Sapporo, moosehead,  Canadian just to name a few, beers cost $3.25/$3.75.  They also serve sake and soju for $12 - $14. I find the alcohol really reasonable.  They also have a very simple menu which offers mostly their famous spicy chicken. They're front page consists most of their popular items. Spicy chicken, spicy chicken with noodles or nachos, etc for ~$18.99. Second page is all fried chicken, you can choose bite size boneless chicken, chicken wings, half chicken or full chicken. All the options listed above are offered in multiple different flavors.  We ordered the spicy chicken with noodles. The portion size is fairly big and enough to share between 2 people. On the menu it stated that it's level of spiciness is 3 chilies, damn were they not joking, it was really spicy!!! ( I can eat spicy like northern China chili oil spicy dishes) The chicken was sweet and spicy but for the noodles, it soaked up all the sauce from the bottom and it was EXTREMELY spicy!!  Service isn't great and don't expect much as it is minimum, like I said a bar atmosphere. Overall, it wasn't anythin spectacular, I would come back but not something on my choice list."}
{"text":"Everything sucks here. The service, vibe, crowd, chairs, tables, floors, decor, washroom... etc.  This place is casual, loud, uncomfortable to sit for a long time. You will need to constantly flag down the waiters for service and when it's busy....you will NEVER get your food!!! Well, maybe just not for like 40 minutes but it feels like forever when you're always hungry like me!  BUT....they have killer wings and chicken and dirtiest (cheap) beers ever. Like $3.50 domestic and $4 import kinda cheap. The chicken is fall off the bone tender while still nice and crispy on the outside. All the flavours are great for the most part, especially the garlic that will stink up your breath for the next 2 days!  Come here when you're feeling like cheap beer and great tasting chicken but it's definitely not a place to chill."}
{"text":"Menu: http://www.buldak.ca/  What we had: blazing fire chicken, teary blazing chicken, blazing fire chicken with cheese, blazing fire squid, original fried chicken, kimchi fried rice, spicy oyster rice soup, special steamed rice, spicy ddokbokki (spicy ricecakes), spicy pork with rice (We had this over multiple visits. We don't eat THAT much.)  Taste: 8/10  Out of my 8 years of occasional visits to this restaurant, I must say that the taste has been very consistent. I come here especially for their spicy ddokbokki, their sauce is not too sweet and very savoury. Along with the ddokbokki I would get the special steamed rice and eat it with the ddokbokki sauce. (Yeah that's a lot of carbs but it tastes so gooooood.) Steven likes the spicy pork with rice, though he sometimes complain that the pork to rice ratio is too low.  The blazing chicken is their signature dish. All of the items that says \"blazing\" on it uses the same sauce. The blazing sauce has a spicy, slightly sweet, and smoky taste to it. My friends like the blazing fire chicken with cheese. I'm impartial to the blazing stuff.  The fried chicken was dry, but it seems to be a popular item. Maybe we were unlucky that day, but I've had better fried chicken at KFC.  The kimchi fried rice is pretty good and not too spicy for my friends that don't usually eat spicy food. Their fried rice is served on a hot plate and tends to be very oily.  The oyster rice soup was OK, nothing special. I don't recall seeing any oyster in it.  Value: 5/10  This place used to have decent value, but now the prices have gone up and the amount they give has gone down. They've been consistent with giving you a complimentary plate of salad and a small dish of pickled daikon. Appetizers/side dishes are at least $10 (ddokbokki being the cheapest), a meat dish (blazing or fried chicken, squid, etc) is around $20, lunch special dishes are around $10.   **Average cost per diner: 25$+ After Tax+Tip but Steven doesn't really like their food so he eats less than he usually does, hence \"+\"  Service/Convenience: 7/10  They are located in a corner of a plaza in the end farther away from Yonge St. Not too easy to locate from the road, but look for a Red Lobster by the road and it's in the same plaza.  Servers are pretty efficient though sometimes it's hard to get their attention/they're nowhere to be found. They're not particularly friendly but they get their job done like any typical Asian restaurant.  Would go back? Yes, sometimes I crave their ddokbokki, I can't find similar tasting ddokbokki anywhere else; I've even looked around in Seoul. Heck even the chain in downtown doesn't make ddokbokki the same way.  Would recommend to friend? If they like spicy Korean food, it's worth a try.  Similar places: None that we know of yet.  **Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza"}
{"text":"I come here for their pork bone soup. If you're not a fan of vege (like me), it's perfect plus it's spicy enough. Sometimes i order their chicken wing fried rice. It's alright but quite oily."}
{"text":"So I went here with a bunch of friends one night for some late night snacks on their suggestions.  At first all I heard was \"the beer is cheap\" and I didn't really need much more than that to push me to this place.  However, I soon found out that I liked a lot more than their beer.  First of all, the do serve a bunch of bar food mixed with some korean food.  Their beers were about 2.00 each which wasn't too bad. I promptly ordered a Tuborg (which I was actually surprised they had in stock) and ordered their spicy rice and oyster soup dish (I really don't remember what this was called).  Their \"bar\" is pretty stocked when you think of how small this place is I guess, but it's all you need to get you through the night.  I counted about 5 types of beer at least, and 3 types of shoju.  At first I actually was going to order a whole bottle of shoju to myself, but realized that it is pretty much like a bottle of wine and then decided against it =P.  I had a bite of their wings, which I wasn't too big of a fan of.  I found them kinda lacking in the meat department, and found they were kinda dry.  Their spicy rice and oyster soup however, was AMAZING!  I would totally recommend this to anyone who likes seafood (and oysters for that matter).  It kinda reminded me of a spicy version of a szechuan oyster congee.  I don't know how authentic this was, but I really liked it.  Would I come back here again?  Hell yes.  Beer plus the oyster rice dish please... every time."}
{"text":"Came here for spicy chicken after my friend recommended it to us. We came here during prime dinner time so it was hard to find parking around the plaza. Be warned - drivers were pretty vicious lol  BLAZING FIRE CHICKEN WITH CHEESE This was delicious - I love the melted cheese that goes with the chicken. It would've been even nicer if they added instant noodles with it but we ordered fried rice, which was good too. First few bites wasn't as spicy but once you chowdown on this - it's spicy alright.  KIMCHI FRIED RICE (with oyster) We thought the kimchi fried rice won over the spicy chicken. So flavourful and not overly spicy. They could add more oysters though (total count of 3)."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere.  Food was very spicy. Side order of noodles is very spicy.  Ordered the blazing fire chicken.   It lived up to its name. Found the chicken itself to have funny taste. Seems like it was off . Very cheap drinks."}
{"text":"I been coming to this place multiple times they have great chicken ... Either get the hold chicken or small pieces... One thing I learned from this place is wine sujo best sojo ever ... The place is nice and the price is good ..."}
{"text":"Came here friends on a Saturday around midnight.  Restaurant was around 40% full.  I wasn't very hungry so I got the spicy chicken soup but with the least spiciest option.  I had a hike the next day so I didn't want an upset stomach during the hike.  The soup tasted good and was the right amount of spice I was looking for.  It came with rice on the side and plenty of chicken in the soup but chicken was too dry.  Also the side dishes were underwhelming compared to other Korean restaurants I been to.  My friends tried the egg soup, spicy grilled chicken with cheese, and korean rice balls.  They all enjoyed their meal.  One my friends was korean and it was interesting to see how he prepared his rice balls before consuming them.  He was given a plastic glove and a plate of rice with seaweed and fish eggs on top.  He then put on the glove and started to form all his rice balls before eating them each with his spicy grilled chicken."}
{"text":"The service was terrible, we came into the restaurant, and looking at the menu for 5 mins, no water was severed. I asked the manager for water, and I was been told the water will be severed after we ordered?! I asked for the water again, the guy gave me the same answer. Most ridiculous service ever had!    Despite of the service, fried chicken wing and fried chicken was fine. The roasted chicken wing was horrible, it was cold inside! Have to ask to recook it! The seafood egg soup was great!"}
{"text":"Meh. We came here for Korean Fried Chicken. And left disappointed.  On another note though, if you want to eat some really spicy chicken, their Tearful Spicy Chicken will set your mouth on fire. I can usually handle some pretty spicy stuff, and this spiciness just about spreads throughout your entire body and squeezes sweat out of your pores.  But if you're looking for Korean Fried Chicken, go to 'Murica and go to Bonchon."}
{"text":"A very good place for Korean food. Strongly recommend egg seafood soup!!! Also, the blazing chicken is good, only it is too spicy for me Lastly, even the side dish is good, especially after spicy food"}
{"text":"When they say spicy, they mean it here!  The chicken is outta control here! SOOO delicous!! It's a good place to go to when you're craving spicy food for sure! I also really like the egg soup. It's soo good!  The wait staff are very attentive. The chicken is made to order so it's piping hot when it arrives and sometimes can take awhile, especially if it's busy. It is worth the wait though! The only thing I wish would change are the tables, I've sat at a few different tables, they seem a bit wobbly and dated - other then that, i'm a big fan of this place."}
{"text":"We ordered Fried Chicken with sweet and hot Sauce (yangnyeom chicken), Blazing Fire Chicken with Sausage, Fried Chicken with Green Onion, and Egg Soup. The yangnyeom chicken had a crispy batter on the outside and moist meat on the inside. The flavour of the sauce was a mix between a sweet and savory taste with a kick of spice, the perfect combination. The Blazing Fire Chicken was cooked with a hot marinade that was very spicy. But even though it was hot, it tasted delicious and the sausages really helped balance out the spiciness. The Fried Chicken with Green onion is a great choice for those looking for a non-spicy dish. The green onion salad had a sesame oil dressing which went really well with the chicken. And the Egg Soup was very delicious and helped to cut the greasiness of all the fried food."}
{"text":"Really great fried chicken, definitely better than the dry salty stuff you get at a popular franchise store with a mustached mascot. I really like the amount of choice and toppings they have available on their menu. You can get your chicken with or without bone, dry or wet, savory or spicy, with or without cheese. Plenty of options for whatever or however you are craving your chicken.  We had the blazing fire chicken with cheese, original fried chicken and boneless chicken with green onion. My personal favorite was the boneless chicken with green onion. The chicken served piping hot with a dry crispy batter on the outside (not greasy) and moist tender chicken inside. The generous heap of green onions on top provided a fresh counterbalance, and the side of pickled radish is a great palette reset button. The blazing fire chicken with cheese came was also good. It came with alot of melted oozing cheese on top, which strings up as you drag a chunk of red-sauced chicken from the pile. A great spice level, enough to give a kick but not enough to numb all your senses."}
{"text":"Mmmhmmm. We usually get the Original Fried Chicken and Kimchi rice.  I guess the french fries are good because the kids and hubs really like them.  Not sure what makes them so special.  We've also tried the corn cheese.  Original Fried Chicken - Thumbs way up, 12 o'clock, nice thin crisp batter, the skin crackles when you bite it and juicy meat inside, not too salty Kimchi Rice - Thumbs up but maybe like a 2 o'clock, a little salty, greasy or as the family calls it \"flavour juice\" Corn Cheese - Ehhhhhhh, 4 o'clock, greasy, salty, non-stretchy cheese.  Service - we've honestly never had an issue with service  We've been around 5:30pm on a weekday and the place was not busy at all.  So good to know if you want to eat in.  Based on reviews I thought it would be a lot smaller but it's a decent sized space.  We've also been at 8:00pm for pick up.  This is when it becomes a slashie.  Restaurant/Night Club.  My hubs said the beats were kicking when he went in to get the order.  Line ups outside."}
{"text":"After a one-hour back and forth about where my friends and I should eat, we came across Home of Hot Taste and decided to dine in. The place was completely empty and I started to feel uneasy, like maybe we should get outta here buuut we didn't.   I ordered the signature blazing chicken with cheese and have yet to pay the price for my lactose sensitivity (god bless). The chicken was tender and juicy, but I wished it was hotter in temperature and spice. Not so hot for the home of hot taste. My friends ordered chicken wings and kimchi fried rice and both were only satisfied. On the plus side, I got to snag some pretty nice cheese pull pics (see attachments).   The only real complaint I have is that we received one pitcher of water and after we finished it, the server took it away only to bring back wet naps for my friend.   I don't think I'll be returning when there are plenty of other Korean restaurants to try."}
{"text":"Good place to hang out or to have a drink, I came here with some friends to snack and decided that we wanted fry chicken, therefore we ordered the fry boneless chicken with onion, it was a lil sweet for me but it's not bad. The price is not cheap, however the portion is big and very filling.   I would recommend this place if you just want to get some fry chicken and chill with friends as the dishes are good for sharing."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this was the first time I tried Korean fried chicken, so I could not attest to its authenticity.  We ordered half a chicken (1 chili), half a dozen spicy wings (2 chilies) and an oyster fried rice (1 chili).  The ingredients were fresh.  The half chicken tasted very spicy to me.  The batter of the half chicken was hard to the bite, but not crunchy.  This was likely because the chicken was soaked in hot sauce.  The chicken wings were labelled as 2 chilies, yet they were less spicy than the half chicken.  They were not battered.  Instead, the wings were marinated in chili flakes, soy sauce and sugar. The result was some devilishly delicious wings.  For both the wings and the half chicken, the sauce or marinate created a level of spiciness and heat, but the flavour didn't numb our taste buds.  I also enjoyed the oyster fried rice, but the flavour was too similar to the chicken dishes, so it didn't stand out to me.  I wished I had ordered something that was not spicy to balance the flavours of the meal."}
{"text":"Great place if you are looking for Korean Fried Chicken. Our go to is the fried chicken with green onions. Goes perfectly with a couple of beers. And if you can handle spicy, definitely try their blazing chicken. We prefer ordering the milder spicy chicken with cheese. They pair so nicely together."}
{"text":"Proceeded to Home of Hot Taste after picking up spicy rice cakes from Miss Korea a few doors down. Ordered the Blazing Fire Chicken in 'hot' to-go.   While we waited, we ordered a bottle of soju. It was approx. 6PM on a Friday night so this place was fairly empty. Our soju arrived with side dishes.   The waiter was approachable and a delight. The food took a while, we'd finished our soju by the time it arrived. No complaints though as we were preoccupied. Could be a bit annoying for others. I'd recommend ordering ahead if you're planning takeout.   The food was delicious! 'Hot' was definitely not spicy enough for me, I'll be trying the 'suicide' next time around.    5 stars for Home of Hot Taste."}
{"text":"Came here in the first month of opening, table for 2 - fried chicken with onions and the fried rice with blazing chicken combo. Waited almost 30 mins for all the food, service is very slow and inattentive. Food quality was decent but a bit overpriced for the small portions."}
{"text":"I tried giving this place a second chance. Waste of my time. Hair in food. Didn't take the food off of the bill. Replaced the dish but the replaced dish was at a subpar quality and took very long. Clearly they had no issue in their subpar service either with their exact words to the hair: \"The manager is not here so I don't know what you want to do about that.\""}
{"text":"A little pricey but the their snowing chicken was so darn good, definitely coming back again!!"}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5 Service: 3/5 Location: 3.5/5  It was my first time trying Korean fried chicken, so upon my friends' insistence, I ordered exactly what they got - Dukbokki and an order of boneless sweet and spicy chicken. If you're into a nice kick of Korean spice, I'd recommend this place. Save yourself the trouble and go for the boneless chicken. Although it is cut into disconcerting cube shapes, overall it's fried to a nice amount of crisp and is served with a generous helping of hot sauce mixed in. The plate of dukbokki was a little less than heaping, it seemed like there wasn't enough at all included on the plate.   There was a lot spice going on an unfortunately all they had was a small plate of cold pickled radishes and water to wash it all down. Even after the water at our table was long gone, nobody came to refill it until we brought it up to them.   They played some very intense trap music (we checked - it was an hour long Trap Hits 2015 Remix) that made me feel like I was eating dukbokki at a club. TIP: Make sure you have enough water refills on hand to douse your tongue if you can't really handle the spice."}
{"text":"Great fried chicken. We had boneless fried and green onion chicken.we also had blazing hot chicken. I thought that was too hot. Cheese corn was good. Beer was great with food.Tables are close together and crowded."}
{"text":"Home of hot taste has been around for quite some time, and was one of my first experiences with Korean fried chicken. I have some very fond memories of kicking back soju here, while chowing down on some crispy fried chicken.   I have gone back quite a few times over the years and it definitely has not regressed compared to other restaurants out there. In fact its stayed pretty consistent through out the years in terms of food quality, service and food selection. My other half and I got the spicy chicken with fried rice, and soft chicken bone on the side for a light lunch on my most recent visit.  If I had written a review a few years ago I likely would have bumped up the star rating to be honest, but unfortunately this place seems to be in \"a rut\". There are quite a few more newer Korean fried chicken restaurants and their prices actually seem pretty steep compared to some other places (such as The Fry to name just one) that has really upped the competition. Other places have newer decor, a slightly different spin on things, different ban chan (korean side dishes) while Home of Hot Taste has remained stagnant over the years. I havent really seen them offer much, if any new ban chan, or new dishes.   Hence, I would say that if I were in the area and had a hankering for Korean Fried Chicken, I wouldnt hesitate coming here for a bite. Though I actually would not go out of my way to specifically come here as there are a lot of other options out there. So Home of Hot Taste wont disappoint you, and if you have not been here its definitely worth a try if your in the area. But I would not go so far to tell people to go out of their way to come here, as I am sure there are other places that they can head to."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try based on the reviews.   Service is really slow on a Thursday afternoon work day. It took almost 30 mins before we got our food. Definitely not the place to go during the work week.  Ordered a pork bone soup which was just ok. Nothing special or memorable about it.  Not sure if I would come back again."}
{"text":"Spicy fried chicken has good flavor and isn't to hard to handle for an old white grandpa like myself. The real challenge is wiping all the sauce off with the stingy amount of napkins served.  Great nonetheless but you may have burning anoooos the next day"}
{"text":"Ordered their original/garlic fried chicken; $28. Fries/sweets potato/onion rings combo; $10. Seafood ramen; $13.  Warning:  the ramen soup was made of instant noodle type.  The chicken tasted good. The fries combo was ok.  Ambiance sucked!  It was warm, AC was not working well.  Seating  was limited. Ban chan consisted of only 1:  cold radish.  Felt ripped off from being served with an instant ramen noodle soup at $13!!!  First and last time here."}
{"text":"Oh man where do I even being with this place.. My god brother took me here for the first time last year and I absolutely love it..  Servers there are friendly and attentive when you call them over.. They always start you with water, salad and pickled radishes..  When I go there I always get their double fried chicken wings which isn't greasy at all  and beef bulgogi rice cakes.. And sometimes their crispy hot wings as well..  It's a good place uptown for cheap Korean food and drinks.. This location is a lot better then their dt location.."}
{"text":"Another business trip, another night of eating out. This evening's choice - one of many restaurants specializing in Korean food in North York - Home of Hot Taste. Famous for their fried chicken and blazing fire chicken dishes, my colleague and I decided to tip toe are way up the ladder of spicy chicken and ordered half of an original fried chicken dish and half of a fried spicy chicken dish with some extra honey garlic sauce on the side for dipping. We'll leave blazing fire chicken till next time (and there WILL be a next time).   The waitress on staff was very helpful when we asked her about portioning and how much we should order. Our order came out fairly quickly with a couple standard ban chan dishes and let me tell you, this fried chicken is awesome. As fast the order came it was devoured even faster....in silence...with the occasional \"wow this is really good\" from two boys who looked like they hadn't been fed well...since lunch.   It happens often when you order fried food that there is almost an understanding that one of the following descriptions will be part of what will be served: heavy batter, bad quality meat, oily. In this case however the fried chicken served had a thin crispy batter, that was surprisingly light for something that's fried and had good quality meat - there was chicken breast pieces, drumsticks and chicken wings and the cooking was really on point. The chicken wasn't dry at all, it came out piping hot. The sauces were just as easy to complement as the chicken. The honey garlic sauce was full of flavor and did not go light on the garlic (which I love). The spicy sauce on the second order of chicken was really amazing. It's a slightly sweeter spicy sauce but does not overdo it on the sweetness. As the first initial taste of sweetness begins to fade say hello to a spicy pepper kick along with an aromatic blend of spices which I find really differentiates itself from a lot of generic spicy sauces you find on fried chicken that have a tendency to be more one note sweet or salty followed by a rush of hot spicy flavor.   All in all, would I go back? Yes, if I'm in the mood for fried chicken this is atop of my list when back in this city and hopefully I'll have the courage to try the blazing chicken."}
{"text":"Decent chicken wings with different flavors to choose from. The chicken wings are on the smaller size, 1/2 the size of regular American chicken wing places to be precise, so I would suggest ordering twice the amount you normally order."}
{"text":"This place never gets old, came here probably around 10 times in the past several years. This place has always been one of the best original spots for KFC (Korean Fried Chicken). HOHT never disappoints. My usual top picks when ordering are:   -blazing fire chicken - sweet and sour wings - boneless fried chicken with green onion  All dishes are really tasty. Tastes even better when you get flavored soju as well. Most of the time this place is pretty consistent with their breading and taste, maybe I have encountered one or two times that there was too much breading but overall it was ok.   One of my go to places whenever craving for some KFC"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, and the spiciness level is actually really spicy. Waiters are okay, not great, but decent overall. Place could be a bit cleaner but overall, I'd come here again."}
{"text":"After awhile, I came back to this place with my boyfriend after Piggy's was super busy.   Service this time around was good, attentive and the food came out at a reasonable time.   This time around ordered the Blazing Chicken, Pork and Squid and Seafood Ddubboki with noodles. The Blazing Chicken was super spicy but it had good flavours - the shrimp was on the drier side though. The Seafood Ddubboki was good, it had a decent amount of spice and big enough to share. If you can't handle a lot of spice, I recommend trying dishes with 1  because anything more would be too much to handle.   Most of the dishes offered here is meant for sharing but the best thing is inexpensive beer. 3.50$ for domestic beer and 4.50$ for premium beer. I personally think this is a good place to hang out and have a couple of drinks with good company."}
{"text":"Nice lil spot with some delicious spicy chicken, decent fries, yummy side dishes, and cheap beer. If you can't handle the spice, they have regular chicken wings too."}
{"text":"If you're not Korean do not come here. Service was terrible. We called ahead to let hem know we had a party of 9 and they agreed to seat us. We had to share 3 menus to start off.  They served us just radish as a starter.  And they said no refills. Okay I understand we are a big group but I'm accustomed to having a nice Korean dish with more than just radish.  In all honesty we felt we didn't receive proper service. We offered to pay for the rice but the server became very aggressive letting us know the food was already being made.   The manager was not there and maybe that's why the service was less than shit.  I'm sure the food is great. We were recommended this place by a family member. I'm bummed out it didn't work out."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not 3.5 stars. I visited this restaurant with my bf for dinner last night (Tuesday night). I've heard that this place has the best korean-style fried chicken in the GTA so I had pretty high expectations, but I was quite disappointed with the quality of food and service.  The restaurant was very empty with only 2 other tables full. So they took our order fairly quickly and the food came soon after as well - 1 star for this. Everything else sucked. My boyfriend got fire blazing chicken with squid and I got fire blazing chicken with cheese. Please note that I love cheese on almost everything, and in the picture on the menu, the chicken was drenched in cheese so I decided to get that... And... Well, food was very disappointing. They pretty much sprinkled cheese on top. Not even half the chicken pieces had cheese on them. Yes pictures can be deceiving but when they are worse than McDonald's ads, there is a problem. Also, both our chicken was super dry as if they were being cheap on the sauce, and was very salty so we had to order rice on side which costs extra. The chicken was not worth its price already. Approx. $15 for 20 poorly cooked chicken pieces? No thanks.  The service was pretty bad too. The waitress that was serving us wasn't attentive at all. We ordered two bowls of rice but she only brought us one and when we asked her for another side dish of radish, she rudely noded then never brought us anything. From my experience, this place is so not worth it. Maybe I'll visit Markham location sometime but I know I'll never be coming back here."}
{"text":"This is the worse service I have had ever! I asked for service over 10 times but they only came for our table no more than 3 times including giving a bill. Even the sever saw that I was shaking my hand, they pretended to see nothing. Bad experience in this restaurant that I don't think they deserved my tips!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now, everything from the food to dining space to service is below average in my opinion. This time, I even found a sliver of hair in the soup I ordered."}
{"text":"If you're into spicy food. I suggest you to come and try out some Korean spicy wings. They also offer wings with cheese flavour, it's taste like the Mac and cheese powder. Bite size perfect pairing with beer  or suju. Another addition dish I would recommend is their blazing fire chicken with octopus."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Home of Hot Taste's amazing fried chicken. Came here for the second time recently. The restaurant itself is visually in need of a makeover. We are talking cheap uncomfortable chairs and tables...but I don't come here for the environment. The chicken is excellent here, they have a wide selection ranging from whole chicken, wings, to pieces cooked in a variety of ways. They also have other entrees such as the Kimchi fried rice which I am a fan off. I personally enjoy the green onion fried chicken the most.   Service is not the greatest here but not expecting much. Did I mention beers and soju are pretty affordable here? Perfect with fried chicken!"}
{"text":"I think a post from blogTO led me here as Home of Hot Taste was purported to be A+ for Korean fried chicken..  Hm, it's one of those things that you salivate prior to the dish being served, you gawk at what's in front of you, devour the food for a couple minutes and realize it's more delicious in theory.  What could go wrong for a fan of spice like myself when you add hot sauce to chicken, and sprinkle some cheese and add a touch of octopus?  I came here twice.  First time I had a combo with the blazing fire chicken + fried rice.  I remember the fried rice being a bit dry and lacking flavour but fortunately saved by the chicken.. which, really, isn't that spicy despite the misleading term of 'blazing fire'.  However, the chicken wasn't dry and it was quite a decently satisfying meal in terms of size.  Second time, we shared a variety of chicken among a party of five.  I think my favourite was the blazing chicken with cheese.. none of us ordered rice, and our meals in their entirety consisted of.. just chicken.  We also tried the hot wings - which had finger-licking sauce that I would like the recipe of.  I thought the salt & pepper fried chicken was a bit dry, and could not be eaten without the salt and pepper due to a complete absence of flavour.  I ordered the blazing fire cihcken with octopus - the octopus was sparse but enjoyable, and again - would've liked more spice.  None of us really finished our plate of chicken even with sharing... I think everything would've tasted better in hindsight if we had eaten in moderation.   The first 10 minutes of eating was amazing, then it became a chore...  I think this place is worth a try if you're around Yorkville and would not like to spend $40+ for dinner and looking for some satisfying homely Korean food"}
{"text":"Delicious! Love this place. We had the fried chicken with green onion. It was a large portion and filled us up! Will definite be coming back. Comfortable place to sit and share a meal with a group."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????Original??????????????????????????????????????????Soy Garlic?????????????????soy garlic ??????????????????????????????????????   ??????????Peak hour???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Came late on a saturday night and was expecting the place to be busy but we were seated right away. Service is good and staff are very attentive. Place is very loud with blasting music. There are several TV's with different channels, i focused on the korean channel.   What i like about the place is it offers a good variety of korean fried chicken and blazing fire chicken. With kids in tow, this is a good place to go.  We ordered the Kimchi rice with oyster. It came on a sizzling plate. I do not eat kimchi but this fried rice is good. Initial reaction was it is super spicy but it slowly grew on me. Next came the blazing fire chicken with cheese. Oh my! It is surely spicy! Leaving hot fire to your taste buds! However, you just can't stop enjoying the spiciness and cheese combination. We were able to finish one.  Last we had is fried whole chicken with green onion. Portion is good. Careful as it is really served fresh, hot and super crispy. I love the freshness of thd green onion on top of the super crispy fried chicken.  Overall experience is really good. I will definitively come back to try other fried chicken flavors."}
{"text":"A small lineup on a Saturday night but the service was pretty efficient so the wait wasn't long. Ordered the egg soup and the sweet sour boneless chicken. First impression of the egg soup was that it's nice and simple - will definitely need to keep a look out for egg soup from other Korean restaurants, it was that good. The sweet sour chicken was okay. The price seems a bit high for the amount of food. Good place for small parties and the meal comes with pickled radish and a side of lettuce salad."}
{"text":"DEVOURED: Half and half ($23.50). I've tried the original, hot, soy, and garlic. The sauce they use for the 'hot' option is the perfect amount of spice with a tinge of sweetness. Get it on the side for an extra $1.50, so you can adjust it to your own liking. The soy and garlic sauces are similar in that they lightly sweeten up the fried chicken. Original is simply delicious with a side of salt and pepper.   Blazing fire chicken w/ cheese ($21.50)- Why anyone would order non-fried chicken when there is fried chicken on the menu is beyond me. Objectively speaking, it's not for the faint of hearts when it comes to spice, but I personally enjoyed it. The chicken was juicy but the sauce could be overpowering.  Fried chicken w/ green onion ($24.50)- A huge plate full of an oddly compatible pairing.   Egg soup ($9.99)- One of the best in town. Fluffy clouds of egg. Powdered eggs (common in Korean recipes for this) or not, it's damn delicious.  EXTRAS: Get the $0.25 coffee as dessert next to the cashier.   VERDICT: I've been here at least over 20 times now over the last five years. Not kidding, nor do I wish I was. It is definitely the best KFC joint in Toronto. HOHT never disappoints, where as other popular and newer KFC places that have popped up have been less than satisfactory in comparison. HOHT is how Korean fried chicken should be- consistently deep fried to perfection with crispy skin to allow for the right amount of crunch into juicy, moist chicken that just melts into your mouth.   RETURNING OR NAW: Take my money."}
{"text":"Awesome korean fried chicken! Tasty and spicy. I love spicy food and can handle really spicy food, their blazing chicken and boneless spicy chicken don't disappoint. The oyster kimchi fried rice is generous on the seafood and delicious.  Place is family friendly and great for big and small group.  Service on weekends can be a bit slow, last couple of times we went, they only have 1 server."}
{"text":"Been going to the Yonge and Steeles for 10+ years now..  Walked in here by accident.  Pretty disappointed..  Place was completely empty and had no atmosphere.  Portions are super small compared to Yonge and Steeles and more expensive too.  Service was super slow and we were the only table there on a Saturday night.  Deep friend boneless chicken was pretty tender tho and the medium hot blazing fire chicken was pretty spicy compared.  Beers are cheap, $4.50/bottle"}
{"text":"Been here so many times, I have friends who really really like this place.  They have changed owners many times over the years,   Menu is pretty simple,  THE must haves are the spicy chicken on a hot plate, i like it with cheese.  Other must haves are fries chicken with green onion, special rice, tokpoki, fried chicken wings with sweet sauce, kimchi fried rice, and egg soup.  Place is always packed but turns over pretty quick.  Great place for soju, beer, and chicken."}
{"text":"Holy @#$! that's hot...the \"blazing chicken\", which the menu boasts is pretty hot, well, is. The rub on this grilled chicken that comes on a sizzling plate is delectable but also nearly impossibly hot. Not for those who don't come with a fire extinguisher. I saw other tables with fried chicken, but lots of beer going down helps with the heat. And this place is a busy drinking joint at 10PM on a Saturday night. (The guy standing guard in front of the fridge holding the beer and soju was a nice touch.)  Also tried the kimchi oyster fried rice in the hopes of having something milder to help with the chicken. Between the heat and how strange-tasting kimchi and oysters are together, I happily let my fellow diner eat 3/4 of it.  I saw older reviews saying cheap beer and that the place closes on Sunday. The price of beer there has gone up (~$3-4 per) from the $2 suggested and signs on the outside saying they're open everyday, including Sunday, until 2am (and no MSG). Clearly these guys are watching these posts and kudos to them.  Service was good, and as someone else mentioned, us non-Asians were given forks and spoons rather than chopsticks with spoons. Yet another restaurant to rant to, saying, if I'm going to eat here, I'd like to be treated the same way as everyone else who walks in."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken is great with the cheap beers or if you feel like trying Korean liquor called soju . I would recommend to try the teriyaki fried chicken and also the blazing chicken which has a combination of sweet and a kick of spicy. Also they have hot soups that are great for this time of the year."}
{"text":"I came here on an evening for takeout of their jjukumi buldalk (blazing fire chicken with mini squid). The place was super packed during dinner time and seemed very popular among young people. The owner here is super nice! He will go out of his way to make you feel very welcome to his restaurant. Lol. He offered me and my dad to a complimentary coffee made from his automatic coffee dispenser, which I believe is also free for all patrons.    We got home to try the food and we really loved the flavour/taste of the chicken and squid! It was definitely spicy, the kind that numbs your mouth a bit, but doesn't pain you too much. It went really well with rice :9. Only thing I would say is that it was pricey for the amount of food we got, imo. It was 19.99+tax for takeout bowl of the size that you would find at T&T supermarket's hot food area (which usually goes for $5.99). And what disappointed me was that it wasn't packed to the brim...it was loosely packed in.  The owner really wanted us to come back and have a sit down at their restaurant if we thought the food was good. I was so surprised by his warm and nice personality! If you haven't tried the food here, you should at least once!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday evening. It was annoying as we had to ask for everything from water, extra napkins, our order....  I did like my wings though. From Cherrie T's tip, I got the Fried garlic soy sauce wings. They were pretty good. Crunchy with that honey garlic type taste I like. I didn't like the price though it was a tad high.   Service was just meh. I don't know why we tipped them 15% when it should have been 10% at best."}
{"text":"I can't even eat spicy but I still continue to visit Home of Hot Taste (HOHT) knowing that I will die in tears everytime! #??? lol. The food is legit spicy lol. If you love spicy food, this is definitely one place you don't want to miss.  The fried chicken itself is very delicious - you can choose to order the whole chicken, half chicken or just wings/drumsticks. I prefer the chicken without sauce because it stays crispy good; the Original and the 5 Spice dry rub are definitely my top choices. I enjoy the Soy Garlic one too but they tend to drench the chicken with way too much sauce.   Foodie Tip: Order the Soy Garlic flavour or other sauces of your choice and ask to have the sauce on the side instead! The chicken stays cripsy, and I like that I can adjust how much sauce I want to dip.  I would also recommend the Oyster Kimchi Fried Rice. I love the flavours, especially the oysters. This dish can be a tad oily because of the spicy oils. Ooo and be sure to order beer to wash all the spicy down and to quench your thirst! They have a nice selection of beer and soju! Grape soju is very tasty - taste like juice - must order lol."}
{"text":"Checked this place out on a late night hunch with a buddy and let me tell you. This places is straight fire! I'm not just talking about heat levels either. We got a small sampler in which we tried the fried chicken with green onion, blazing chicken on a skillet with sausages and an order of kimchi and oyster fried rice. The fried chicken was so crisp it was unreal. The meat was still moist and succulent. The flaming chicken was tasty, well-spiced and flavourful too. The sausages weren't the main event so I give some leeway on their generic processed feel. The fried rice was also excellent, a little stingy on the oysters, but to be expected. Overall I'm definitely coming back for the fried chicken - it makes a nice alternative to chicken wings and beer. Just a heads up though, don't expect late night Chinese food prices, this place isn't cheap."}
{"text":"I love this place. they have great fire chicken(spicy chicken). I always have the one with cheese topping since I can't really handle super hot but I love it! rice is a good pair for the spicy chicken. I also like their seafood nooroongji soup. yummmmmm.  their chicken, fried chicken menus are very good, yet I'm not so sure about pork cutlets. :P"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots! The garlic soy chicken is amazing! The kimchi fried rice and the regular fried rice is also very pleasant.  Make sure you make reservations ahead of time because on Fridays or weekends it gets super packed and the place isn't that big.  The staff is friendly and so far they have explained things on the menu well enough for us to understand. They have forgotten to bring us water and napkins a few times but I don't blame them because the place does get pretty busy.  Overall, I recommend this place! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Have been here on a number of occasions and have consistently been satisfied. The fiery chicken is very flavourful and has just the right amount of kick, I really enjoyed it every time we get it.   To me the highlight would be the original fried chicken, which has just the right crunch on the outside, and moist and tender meat on the inside... I'm considering giving up KFC, that's how serious I am about the fried chicken here.   They give these pickled white radish as one of the complimentary side dishes, really cleans the palate and is refreshing to snack on. Would come again.   WYWH"}
{"text":"I started visiting this place often with the recommendation from my friend who absolutely loves it here!  I couldn't understand why until I finally came here one night...  They are absolutely FANTASTIC to visit for a late night bite if you're craving some KFC (Korean Fried Chicken).  Don't expect great service here, because service isn't what you're paying for, it's the chicken.  My two favourite orders of all times are the egg soup (which is like steamed egg) and their spicy fried chicken (with the sauce on the side, because I can't take that much spice)!  They close late, and it's not far from where I live, so I ALWAYS come here when I've got a late night craving now.    I tried to get creative one night and ordered their snowy chicken (see photo), but it wasn't worth the price, chicken was good, but it was like they sprinkled mac & cheese or popcorn cheese powder on top, not my thing. If you haven't been here, try it and you'll know why, but stick with the classics. Even my 13 year old brother is addicted now & he's asking me for KFC at 11PM..."}
{"text":"If you like fried chicken (and c'mon, who doesn't?) and trying different ethnic dining, visit this place. It's Korean all the way, no compromise for local customs, but it doesn't have the usual kimchee etc. Main dishes come with lettuce salad and crunchy-sweet.pickled radish.   The chicken is the star. It's crispy outside, juicy inside, pretty much perfect. Don't fear the signature Blazing Fire sauce. It's hot but not crazy hot as it sounds, and quite different from the usual wing joint fare. We also had garlic soy sauce which was good, but Blazing Fire can hook you. Wash it down the Korean way--with beer. You'll want to go back, maybe to try other dishes if you can forego the chicken. We'll try more sauces on future visits.   I'd call the forgettable decor tired modern, and they should give wet naps for sticky fingers, but forget that petty stuff. The real reasons to go are placed on your table."}
{"text":"Location & hours- parking can be a little crowded but overall pretty good. Excellent place to grab a bite after a late night out with friends.   Drinks- cheap! Their beers are well priced and are about $5 a bottle.   Food- highly recommend sharing their fried chickens. A whole can feed about 3 people. If you're a fan of classic crispy chicken, I would just get the original or the garlic soy crispy chicken (one of my favourites). I also recommend the sweet & sour sauce chicken which you can request to have a little but of spice (which I highly recommend if you're a spice lover). If you want to be really unhealthy but drool over crispy-ness of chicken, order a side of chicken skin! The 3 flavours I had mentioned are really good. Though I'm not a fan of green onions, there is an option to get crispy chicken with green onions (and has no bones). Their whole and half chickens do have bones which is the only downside of trying to eat the chicken... But hey it's chicken and it's flavourful!   Overall- recommended! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Home of Hot Taste is not so hot.  Checked them out for lunch.  I wanted to order the oyster fried rice...they were out of oysters so they were substituting with chicken - PASS!    I ordered the Korean BBQ lunch special ($8.99) instead.  It came with 5-6 pieces of small Korean ribs (somewhat fatty, not too much meat) and a small bowl of white rice.  I had to request kimchi.  No expansive selection of sides like other Korean places.  I'm a small eater and I was still hungry at the end of lunch.   My friend ordered the Pork Bone Soup lunch special ($6.99).  He said it was just okay...he's had better elsewhere.  Should have tried their fried chicken if that is truly their specialty but wasn't impressed with the things we did order."}
{"text":"Good place to go for chicken and beers! Not many uptown places where you can get drunk for cheap, and get tasty food at the same time.  I haven't been going here very long but i've heard that the quality has gone down in recent years. A couple times the chicken has been bland other times it's been delicious, so it's kind of a crapshoot.  A really good place to go with a group to have beers and relax.  Easy to drive to, easy to park, and a mostly young crowd.  Almost everything is a degree of spicy, so if you can't handle heat be careful what you order!!"}
{"text":"I came with a small group of friends (who love this place) and we ordered the garlic soy sauce and the spicy wings. The wings themselves were quite delicious (crunchy and meaty) and every piece of chicken was drenched in sauce which is great! However, the price is a little expensive and the size of the wings and the number of chicken you get is not very large.  As someone who loves garlicky ANYTHING, I really enjoyed the garlic sauce wings (tasted like your usual honey garlic wings from other chicken wing restaurants but this one tasted more \"real\" since they used real garlic). The spicy sauce was interesting -- it was spicy and sweet and had a distinct taste that (upon reading others' reviews) I realize is cinnamon. I don't know how I feel about the spicy sauce because the cinnamon taste was quite dominating. I do like cinnamon, but I don't know how I feel about it on wings.   Atmosphere is great because everyone is there to just eat, drink, and relax with friends. Service was nothing exceptional (ie. they never came around to give us more water, they don't really pay attention to you when you need something, etc) but I don't feel like this place is trying to provide any customer service anyways (neither do I care).   I don't crave to visit this place again, but I will definitely come back with a couple of friends when we want to relax and have some korean chicken."}
{"text":"Experience: horrible!  I love the location up north and was expecting something similar but when I ordered takeout they proved me that these locations are so different in in terms on service and taste.  I ordered small original and blazing chicken to go. Ended up waiting for more than 25m for 5 pieces per box. Plus the chickens weren't even fried and seasoned properly.  Won't come back to to this location."}
{"text":"My go to spot for Korean fried chicken. I've been here more times than I can count with both my hands. That's how good it is. The chicken is incomparably juicy, crispy and flavourful. Some foods you MUST TRY:   - fried chicken with green onions: the green onions give it extra flavour. Even if you don't like onions, get it anyways you won't regret it  - fried chicken with garlic soy sauce: hint of sweetness makes it unforgettable  - blazing chicken with cheese - special sesame rice: so simple but so good  - dok boki: finally a place that makes it SPICY when requested.   I prefer bone in for the chicken as it gives that extra juiciness. Boneless is also good. Many seatings available in the resultant, tons of parking available too."}
{"text":"I think I do not like that much Korean food... after BBQ, bone soup, bibimbap, I tried this one, where I had a hot chicken plate (with cheese) and again... I do not like it.  Looked well on the picture (I thought that perhaps it would taste as good as spaghetti bolognese), but it was so dry in real... the plate is not sizzling (absolutely no liquid or sauce or veggie to sizzle here!). Spicy but with the same global flavour as in kimchi (but, here, in its dehydrated version). Generous meat portions, but not that cheap at all. You can opt for the rice-hot chicken combo (rice is famous for its watery content, eh!?)  Last comment: this place is really noisy! either regular customers go there to really eat-and-shout or I am getting younger and my hearing accuracy is improving!  Why 3 stars and not 1 or less then? because 1) I have not got sick after eating there, 2) it is open late, 3) it is downtown and 4) I gave 2 stars to places much worse than this one."}
{"text":"Ordered:  Oyster Kimchi Fried Rice - $9.99 Garlic Soy Fried Chicken (half) $11.99  For 2 people, it was very filling. We ordered small chicken wings but they gave us the wrong order - half chicken instead. Personally, I'm sure the wings would have tasted a whole lot better. The white meat was too dry. Not enough sauce. We were expecting crunchy fried chicken but it was more on the soft saucey side. For first time k(orean)fc'ers, I would recommend sticking to the original fried chicken.  The kimchi fried rice was good, but nothing amazing. Fried rice in Chinese restaurants tastes a lot better. There was a good amount of spiciness to it, but very little oyster. Kimchi taste was too light I could barely taste it.   Total came up to about $24 before tips.  It was good overall, but not good enough for me to come back again. I think next time I'll try Dakgogi or The Fry."}
{"text":"If you were a good friend of mine and was craving chicken, I would tell you ALL about Home of Hot Taste. Yeah... Not KFC, not Popeyes (their spicy chicken has gotten tamer and tamer lately...), but Korean Fried Chicken. That should be what KFC stands for now.  The first time I came here, I was sold on their Blazing Fire Chicken. Tender, juicy pieces of chicken with a sweet and gradually spicy sauce on a cast iron plate.  This time around, we got the Blazing Fire Chicken with Cheese. If it's your first time and you want to test your meddle, order this first. It's only got one pepper icon to its name, and I didn't find it as spicy. Still the same amount of deliciousness though!  We also got the Boneless Fried Chicken with Special Sweet Sauce. The chicken was crispy from start to finish, something you rarely see, and the sauce has a nice tang to it. OH SO GOOD.  Another thing you should order of the menu is the Fried Chicken with Green Onion (with lemon mustard sauce). Sweet, onion-y and refreshing!  In the words of John Catucci, \"You Gotta Eat Here!\""}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for a night of \"casual\" drinking. I emphasise casual because not often does it stay that way with their great food and low prices on alcohol. Known for their KFC (that's KOREAN Fried Chicken) and their great recipe for spice, this place is a popular spot just north of Yonge and Finch.  First Impressions: This place is always busy but there is enough seating that you usually don't have too wait long. Like most Asian restaurants I've been to, the service is something left to be desired. Serves do their job and that about it. Great selection of beer at a very decent price. All beer is under $5 including import such as Heineken, Asahi and Hite Stout.   Food: The food here is always consistent however the last couple of times I have gone there the portions seem to be smaller. I have also noticed that the prices have gone up a couple of dollars and obviously I am not too happy about this.   Must Have's: Blazing fire chicken with cheese, original fried chicken with green onion, spicy noodles with chicken and the stem egg soup. These are the most popular dishes on the menu and the GO TO's for me. Oyster kimchi fried rice, teary blazing chicken and anything with the word \"blazing\" in it is pretty good. I have never had a bad dish here, chicken is moist, beer is ALWAYS good, sauce is flavorful and has a good kick to it.   Opportunities/Suggestions: Please stop the increase of prices, it started with the Soju ($13.99 to $16.99), give us back the portions from just a few months ago and I guess it wouldn't hurt for the servers to smile once in a while even if it is a fake one!  Overall Impressions: Unless the prices increase a few more dollars or the portions get ridiculously small, I will still come back here every once in a while because the food is just soooo good and the cost of alcohol (for now) is very affordable."}
{"text":"Was really excited to check this place out, especially after hearing strong reviews for their Thornhill location. Disappointingly, the chicken was just \"meh,\" and the service was \"sub-meh.\"  FOOD:  Our large group came mostly for the Korean Fried Chicken - I went with one order of the \"Sweet and Sour,\" and one order of the \"Plain.\" Although the batter and flavouring was fine for both, both my dishes came luke-warm. Also, aside from a couple of meaty pieces, many seemed to be mostly bone.   Being a rather hygienic person, I wasn't thrilled with the fact that the paper holding the chicken was too short - meaning that my food was partially sitting directly on the plastic container, which for some reason was already sticky (yuck!).  SERVICE:  The server seemed like a nice enough guy, but he was rather slow and inattentive throughout the night. He didn't seem to know what was offered on the menu, or be able to explain specific items. In addition to certain items not being available to order (despite being listed on the menu), mistakes in orders, and the aforementioned inefficiency, the service could definitely improve.  ATMOSPHERE:  Most Korean bars/restos are not the most aesthetically pleasing, but this place still had a bit of a dingy vibe. Perhaps when the lights dim low, and the drinks start being served, there would be a better vibe.  VERDICT:  Probably won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"New Korean fried chicken place in Koreatown. They have another location in Thornhill as well but this was our first time trying it. This location is spacious and would be great for groups.   For our first time, we got the half and half chicken of original fried chicken and spicy. The chicken is of good quality. Lots of white meat but a tad on the dry side. Had to ask for a side of ketchup for the original fried chicken. The batter on the chicken was thin and the chicken was fresh and crispy. Really good quality. The spicy chicken was incredibly spicy for us so we'll probably opt for mild spiciness next time. The egg soup was recommended to us by the server to help neutralize the spiciness. I really enjoyed the egg soup. We also ordered kimchi fried rice. The rice was good but not a stand out dish. One thing to note is that there's not a lot of banchan - just pickled radish and kimchi.   The service here is spectacular. Servers are proficient in English, helped explain the menu for us first timers, and were always around when we needed something. Would recommend and definitely would come back to try their other chicken flavours."}
{"text":"There's a sister restaurant by yonge and steeles that my friends always go to for their blazing fire chicken (with cheese) and so when the time came for me to try it, we went to the downtown location, only because it's closer to me.   Located just south of Bloor, this place can be easily missed because it's so tiny. And I guess because it's located downtown, the prices are a little bit more expensive than in the north.  The nine of us only ordered three types of dishes (x2) - blazing fire chicken with cheese, stir fried rice cakes, and Korean Fried Chicken. + lots of soju and beer.   What I liked: tasty tasty tasty for all the dishes What I would have liked better: if the dishes were spicier, because they weren't all that spicy What I was irritated with: the lack of vegetables on their menu What I was surprised about: only two appetizer dishes -- iceberg lettuce with salad dressing and pickled daikon  I do want to come back and try their other dishes because they looked really really good.  The service was slow. Two servers and a restaurant full of people. But super friendly, which made the experience a lot better."}
{"text":"I honestly believe the food here is significantly better than the one at downtown. A GIANGARTUAN group of us (~30) came here for our friend's birthday. For every table of four, we had a fire chicken, fried chicken, rice cake, egg soup.  I don't think it's as spicy as what everyone else made out to be. The rice cake perhaps the spiciest of them all, but I thought it was to taste.  Food is fantastic, service is fantastic. They have beer, but they also have Mango Aloe drinks. If only I lived closer..."}
{"text":"Tasty chicken and good place to go to hangout with friends. Can't go wrong with beer and chicken. Would also recommend going to \"Cups\" for dessert, which is right across the parking lot in the same plaza.   Reason for the fours stars is because this place is a bit pricey for just fried chicken, I'd be going here a lot more often if prices were more reasonable.  Edit: Taking another star off. Went here for pickup the other day, and they messed up one of the orders. Had to wait again for the correct order, offered no service recovery for the inconvenience -- these kind of moments are crucial for businesses and distinguish a good one from a bad one."}
{"text":"Get your mouths ready for a spicy beat down, because that's what you'll get! The glass Noodles in spicy sauce were majorly spicy, but I can see the appeal for those who can handle it. Steamed egg soup is fantastic, but that might have been my biased, burning taste buds in need of comfort. But by far, the crispy chicken was fantastic. Skin was crispy, tasty and came with salt/pepper combo. Inside was juicy. No excessive oil seeping out! Also tried the sweet and sour chicken... Good in that lots of sauce and flavor with some crunch still, but preferred the original. We ordered a whole second original crispy chicken after the first order, couldn't get enough   Oh, and that coffee machine in the back? Spits out a small cup of free coffee. Kinda awesome!"}
{"text":"Ate the squid and chicken dish on a Saturday.  For $20+ it should have at least come with a bowl of rice.  No service, but it's Korean so it was expected. Perhaps the charm of being stereotyped as a culture that doesn't provide customer service is actually a clever marketing tactic that brings more business in.  The conversation of customers must go something like \"What do you want to eat tonight?\" \"I don't know, but I hope they have bad service. I love that kind of meal when I eat out and pay tips.\" \"Okay...How about Korean food?\" \"That sounds Perfect! I love their service consistency.\""}
{"text":"This is the stuff!  My friend told me this place hasn't been getting that many customers due to the price hike which did make sense. Before, they gave out complimentary salad that was refillable but now they give you it and your had the pay extra if you wanted more salad. I always come here to eat their ddukbokki, good stuff! Their sauce is really good, comes piping hot and spicy. Adding cheese to it ($3 extra) makes it so much better.  I got their pork cutlet with fries and wow it was really good, no regrets ordering it. My friend got the spicy grilled chicken eith rice and she liked it. I only come here when in the area and I never forget to order their rice cakes."}
{"text":"Blazing fire chicken is not that spicy but its really tender and delicious. not a fan of the sticky rice it came with though. people say the fried chicken and the kimichi rice are great here. will have to try it next time. prices for food and drink are very reasonable. its a small place on yonge so it's very easy to miss it."}
{"text":"Tried two flavor of their fried chicken -  original and garlic. The chicken was dry for the garlic flavor and the skin wasn't crispy enough for the original.   Service was also bad. We were at the far corner so noone bothered to look at our direction.. to the point where I had to walk up to the waiter to get their attention."}
{"text":"Was there this weekend for dinner with a friend. Very busy but efficient. The floor could have been swept though. Good value for beer to start. Had hot rice noodle dish, chopped radish, mushroom rice dish ? , and the main course was the deep fried whole chicken. It was a noisy, fun environment with generous portions. The chicken was outstanding and helped by a selection of dipping sauces.  Will return for sure."}
{"text":"- 2 Waiters  - Lunch Specials  - 6 Spicy Chicken Wings with Fried Rice on a Hot Plate ($6.99)   Everything is Hot at Home of Hot Taste!   I was kind of expecting the Chicken Wings be sinfully crispy but not happening this afternoon. They were kind of smallish but were quite tasty. The sauce was quite interesting as it has this spiciness with a hint of sweetness. The fried rice though was really oily with not much flavours, I wish they were drowned in some hot sauce.   I think I need to come back and just eat a half crispy skin fried chicken........... and extra HOT please!"}
{"text":"I have to say I'm very disappointed about their food. The flaming/blazing chicken is just tooooo dry. They ran out oyster so we only got kimchi fried rice, which is good, but not like amazing good! A lot of other Korean restaurants can do better than this"}
{"text":"Maybe because this is my first Korean fried chicken place but I think the food is great. The location is a bit dark and seems a bit grungy but it's a bar so it's part of the experience but the chicken is pretty good though not mind blowing.   I have been back but I'll reserve the 5 stars for something that makes me really stand out.  Had the fried rice which was awesome. Standard fried chicken and the garlic one (which was a bit too garlicky for my taste)."}
{"text":"This is the second time going and I have to say they fry their chicken really well. And their pickled radish tastes really good too.  The pork cutlet is well fried as well. The sauce is different from the usual one restaurant usually serve which was a good change. It tastes like they added cheese, which tasted surprisingly good.  Service is good, and the prices are good too. Food also came out fast.   I recommend trying the fried chicken and pork cutlet. Try avoiding their heavy sauced chicken if you don't like that alcohol taste. It's very strong."}
{"text":"Amazing fried chicken. My favourite near my home. On par with my other go-to: The Fry. Love those green onions on top of the chicken.   The soy mustard sauce is very tasty.   We also ordered a baked chicken and rice dish - very spicy - but really good flavour. I liked the option to get unbreaded chicken get as well.   They have a 25c mini coffee machine - just like in Korea! I loved those machines everywhere. It really feels authentic. All Korean clientele so you know it's the taste of home. Enjoy that baked corn as well!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for amazing Korean fried chicken this is the place you're looking for!  We came as a group of 6 and ordered three platters of Korean fried chicken & sweet potato fries.    We got the fire blazing chicken with cheese, bite sized fried chicken with green onion and sizzling hot chicken. I'm not much of a spicy food eater so the fire blazing and sizzling chicken was a bit too intense for me. The flavours were amazing and it was the perfect meal for late night dinner.   The service and staff were exceptional and they were extremely kind and courteous. Our group was dying from the heat of the chicken so they had prepped water filters ready for us when we asked.  Overall, this place has earned my trust and I'll be heading back some time.  I'm also not a drinker but I know they have reasonably priced beers and pitchers so definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. My review will be a mix of both experiences.  The environment is very casual, just a nice little place to grab a beer and eat food.  In regards to service, the first time we sat in the more open area and getting hold of a waiter was easy with just a raise of the hand and eye contact. In the booths, however, it was near impossible and service was unbelievably slow. The first time the food came out fast, the second time we waited quite a while. Service is a bit inconsistent.  In regards to the food, they give you a small salad and a side dish of pickled radishes that go great as a palate cleanser and with the beer.  The dukkboki was super spicy (which is to be expected from a place called \"Home of Hot Taste\").  We also ordered the Fried Spicy Wings which were also very spicy with a nice sweetness. I could only eat one because I'm not use to so much spicy food.  The Fried Garlic Soy Sauce Wings were really really garlicky but sooooo good. I really enjoyed these but I don't expect anyone will want to kiss you after you eat them. But it's totally worth it I swear. They are super moist and juicy.  The last was the Fried Chicken with Green Onion. I saw this ordered by another table and I had to try it. The green onions are raw, shredded and dressed in a light soy vinaigrette. I really liked this but again, I don't think anyone will want to kiss you after this dish either (but totally worth it).  Overall I really liked the food and I would come here again if I'm in the neighbourhood.The only improvement would be on the inconsistent service."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  Their fried chicken!! Koreans love fried chicken and their sauce is what makes the fried chicken unique from KFC, Popeyes, Mary Browns etc.   I had a previous experience with Korean fried chicken and I come with some expectations in mind. I ordered the fried chicken without the sauce and the fried chicken with the spicy sauce. If you can't handle spicy, you might want to opt for non spicy because it can get spicy or ask them to put the sauce on the side as a dip. There is also the sweet and sour sauce option as well. I do like their batter here. The batter reminds me of Popeyes chicken because the look of the batter is similar. The fried chicken on its own has no taste though unfortunately, so you can either add salt that they have provided on the side or ask for condiments to dip your chicken in.   The chicken comes in wings or drumsticks. They don't come in breasts or thighs. There is an option to come in a whole chicken or boneless chicken.   LAST TIP?!  I would suggest ordering the saucy fried chicken over the original fried chicken where there's no sauce because there's more flavor with the sauce added to the chicken. On the contrary, if you like the fried chicken on its own, you can opt to sprinkle some salt to your chicken."}
{"text":"Can here for some KOREAN FRIED CHICKENNNNN! I ordered the whole chicken but got half breaded and the other have in the spicy sweet sauce paired with oyster kimchi fried rice which was good and spicy. Overall great place, fast service and amazing food."}
{"text":"Was in the neighbourhood so I decided to try this place for some spice. Ordered the spicy chicken with fried rice. The chicken is hot and very tender which I enjoyed. The rice was slightly oily but it tasted really good.  Service was quick and didn't have to wait.  Definitely would come back again."}
{"text":"With the new craze over Korean fried chicken I was very excited to check this place out. It is one of the only joints open before 4pm! The menu seemed to lack some variety as it focuses mainly on spicy chicken. I ordered the spicy chicken with cheese and the fried chicken with green onion. The fried chicken came in crunchy bite sized pieces but didn't have a wow factor. Not something I would drive 20min to eat. I think there was a drizzled sauce but it was so minimal I didn't even taste it. The spicy chicken was more unique, it had a slight bbq sauce flavour and nice kick but the melted cheese quickly hardened causing a slight disappointment. Overall a nice joint to eat with friends late at night but I don't think it's worth a second visit."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that I'm surprised that I didn't get food poisoning after eating here.  The place looks super sketchy from outside, and I probably should've listened to my better judgement, but, alas, peer pressure is still a thing.  I ordered the Beef Bulgogi dish, which came with steamed rice (80%), fried veggies & the beef pieces. The beef itself looked greyish-brown, which is always what you want to see! /sarcasm  Out table of 8 also received complimentary bottomless iceberg salad, which found a bottom pretty quickly, and was not replenished.  When my dish arrived, instead of typing 'Yelp' into my browser I accidentally typed 'help', which is what my stomach was probably screaming.  That night, all 8 of us were enjoying rice like it was the most precious thing on the planet. The chicken and beef were covered with so much spicy sauce and MSG that it was hard to discern the taste of foul meat. But we did it anyways. Hooray us!  All in all, I will not be coming back here even if you paid me. Unless it's for some scrumptious steamed white rice."}
{"text":"I love Korean Fried Chicken. They're the real KFC, in my opinion. Okay, bad jokes aside, this place is really nice. Prices are pretty on par with other Korean fried chicken places I've seen, and the restaurant itself is clean and spacious. They get a lot of natural light from the windows and always have kpop playing in the back (though the TV shows sports).   I came here with two friends during a slow day. There were only one or two other groups at the time. Our server's shift ended halfway through our meal and we got a new one, but no complaints about that because both were quite friendly!   One of my friends is sensitive to spicy food, so we decided to get half original, half spicy. I must admit that I, too, am sensitive to spicy food, and the Hot option was HOT. It wasn't like fire noodle challenge spicy, but there was a really good kick to it. The chicken was all fried fresh and it was super crispy and juicy. I'm craving it as I type. We were given some radishes as an in between, and the original chicken was given with some salt. Those radishes were a saving grace that day. We also ordered fries, but I mean, not much to say about them. They were good fries.  This location is out of my way, but the one in North York is a lot closer to me. I'll definitely be checking out their other location in the fall.   4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"My favourite place for korean fried chicken! unlike a lot of other kfc places that are fairly small and crowded with only street parking available, home of hot taste is located in a plaza that offers plenty of parking. Super convenient for me as a lot of other kfc places further down yonge requires me to bus or walk a fair distance.   Every time i come here i always get the half and half (half original fried chicken and half of your choice, i usually go with soy), which is plenty enough for 2 people. I am always blown away at how fresh, crispy, and juicy the chicken tastes. Cant say for the other flavours, but the soy flavoured fried chicken has the perfect amount of sauce whereas some other places like to completely drench their chicken in the sauce. I've gotten their fried rice once, and it was a bit too oily for my liking, bit it had a nice crispy bottom portion. which was delicious.   As for pricing, they are fairly cheap at around 22-25ish dollars for a large size fried chicken portion (enough for two people) depending on what flavours you want. In my opinion, very reasonable for the quality you get.  Service is average for what you would expect at most asian restaurants. Waitresses are not the friendliest but they are prompt and not too difficult to wave down when you need a water or radish refill (radish refills are free btw).   Overall, 4 stars for seriously delicious food and average service. Definitely give this place a try if you are craving korean fried chicken!"}
{"text":"I love love love Korean Fried Chicken!! I've been to Home of Hot Taste in Thornhill before so I'm pretty stoked to see a location pop up in Koreatown. The restaurant was clean, spacious and comfortable, and would be good for groups. I dined here on a Friday night with a group of 8, and didn't have any issues with service. I note that one review complained about the food being served at different times, but really that's how Asian restaurants work. It works a lot better if you share everything family style, as our group did. Here's what we ordered:  Blazing Fire Chicken with cheese ($21.50) - this was one of my favs of the night. Not too spicy and super delicious. There's an option with no cheese but I would highly recommend the cheese - it goes very well with the sauce and helps offset the heat.  Original Fried Chicken ($22.50 for L) - juicy and tender with the outside crispy fried, it's perfect fried chicken goodness!  Fried Chicken with Green Onion ($24.50) - This is a slightly amped-up version of the original fried chicken. If you were only to order one, this would be my recommendation. The green onion adds a unique flavour and texture when paired with the yummy fried chicken (and as a bonus, it's boneless!) This was my favourite of the night.  Spicy Korean Rice Cake ($10.99) - warning - this is REALLY spicy. We actually asked for it to be less spicy but it was still easily the spiciest dish of the night. But it's worth it because it's so yummy!  Egg soup ($9.99) - a great option to offset all the fried chicken and heat! This is like a combo of chicken soup and steamed egg together (there's really more egg than soup). Egg soup sound strange but it was definitely a winner.  Prinkle (??) Chicken - can't remember the actual name of this dish but it was basically fried chicken topped with a cheese powder. This was my least favourite of everything we ordered because I found the cheese powder a little strange and preferred the fried chicken on its own.    Overall, our meal was fantastic and we had a great time. We were all a tad fried-chickened out by the end of the night but the food was great and reasonably priced. I will definitely come back next time I have a craving for Korean fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Had the boneless half and half fried chicken bites that had scallions or sweet onions on the top. One side had a honey mustard like sauce and the other sauce was like a light soy sesame flavour. The crunch of the fresh veggies makes a nice balance, feels less greasy. Also had the oyster rice soup. Hot and bubbly with seaweed, slices off fresh jalapeno, overall thought have the fried chicken with the soup rice was a good balance (dry crunchy chicken vs wet nourishing seafoody goodness). Not too salty, and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. Must come back and try more dishes with a group!"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars  We got the blazing fire chicken with cheese and the fried chicken wings with soy garlic sauce. Firstly, the portions were extremely small for the price. The taste was good but nothing special. $21.50 for a plate of mediocre chicken with some cheese? No, thanks. The soy garlic sauce chicken was really oily and soggy but still a little crunchy. The texture of the chicken was inconsistent. We also tried the instant coffee for 25 cents. It was small cup that tasted like typical instant coffee. There's nothing special here. Service wasn't great. If you're in the area with some loose change then check it out. But I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"It's Korean comfort food. The typical Korean fried chicken and beer place. Loved their original fried chicken, very tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. The pickled reddish pairs perfect with the rich fried chicken.   However the powdered (snow) fried chicken, soooo sweet, way way way too sweet, unless you have a huge sweet tooth I was recommend against it.   Also got the popularly kimchi fried rice( once with oysters and once with chicken), it's not bad but nothing stood out.   If you want a Korean fried chicken and beer kind of meal, this is not a bad place to try out."}
{"text":"This is where I go if I crave Korean spicy chicken. They are famous for their blazing fire chicken, which is grilled (not deep fried) chicken pieces, super super spicy. If you don't like spicy food, don't order it! There is an option to get cheese on top, which I strongly recommend. If you like spicy food, put yourself and friends to the challenge!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  Hot and fresh!  My friends and I came here on a Monday evening. It wasn't too busy until 7ish.   We ordered the spicy chicken nacho, green onion boneless chicken and the oyster pancake.   Spicy chicken nacho, the nacho chips were a bit stale, and the spicy chicken was very spicy. So people who can't take spice, don't order it!! 19$!  Whole green onion boneless chicken, this was great!! Nothing to complain about. 23$!  Oyster pancake, literally 6 pieces of chopped oysters. So it wasn't really worth 17$!   Cheap beer, good company!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get some good ol' Korean Fried Chicken. This is a must order, for any first time visitors. But don't be fooled by the one red hot pepper noted on the menu for this dish, because it certainly feels like three red hot peppers after the first bite. They don't play around when they called it \"Blazing Fire Chicken\", because your mouth is literally on fire, but damn, is it oh so good and worth the runny nose. And who can say no to all that cheesy goodness with pineapple?! Perfect dish for this chilly weather and best enjoyed amongst good company."}
{"text":"Updating the review because the service was amazing during the second visit. Was offered refills on the side dishes and was given an extra side dish of kimchi.  Ordered the pork bone soup and the portion was big, almost double the size of other Korean restaurants. The food still took a long time but a it was a fair trade a for freshly prepared meal.  Biggest reason for updating review was for the waitress who ran out in the cold without a jacket (almost half a block) because she thought the huge tip was forgotten change. -Updated March 29, 2016  Walk into a very simply renovated restaurants where all the tables and chairs were black. Have a choice of booth or table, the waitress lets the customer choose. There are lunch specials on the first page of the menu, followed by starters and entrees. There was only one waitress working during lunch so the wait for service was a bit long. The food also took some time so it must have been made fresh.  Meal came with three appetizers: coleslaw, kimchi and pickled radish. The blazing chicken fried rice was first to arrive. It tasted very good when it was hot, it was sticky rice and it was made perfectly. The chicken just as its name was blazing spicy. After the dish cooled down, there was a visible amount of oil covering the plate and the rice. It was less appetizing by then as the oil taste was more apparent as well. The assorted fried plate was amazing. The fries and sweet potato fries were fried to perfection. The exterior was crispy and the interior had this airy sensation. The calamari was crispy but could use a bit more seasoning, the two sauces (aioli and sweet plum sauce) were great to dip. The fried chicken was good but not a huge fan of white meat, always feels a bit dry.  Overall, will go again to grab lunch on those not so busy work days where sneaking away for more than an hour would be okay."}
{"text":"I had the mild fried chicken and my friend and her bf got the spicy fried chicken and spicy seafood soup with fish cake. My chicken tasted like fried chicken doused in honey garlic sauce. The seafood soup was good. It was spicy but not too spicy. However, my friend and her bf found that their fried chicken was too spicy and weren't able to finish it.   I didn't expect much of service but I found that the waiter hardly ever came by and we had to go up to him to ask for more water."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and it was not busy at all. We ordered the spicy fried chicken with sweet and sour sauce and the seafood oyster kimchi fried rice. Both dishes were really delicious, but both really spicy as well. If you can't handle spice, I would advise not to get the spicy flavours and try soy garlic instead! I would also like to try the egg soup when I come back next time. I'm not sure if I was really hungry or what but it felt like the food took forever to come though. I would like it if they had more side dishes to munch on while waiting! This place is really good to come with friends since the items are mostly for sharing, so if you come with more than two people you can try more dishes on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Their new menu does not sit well with me. It used to be my favourite place for soon tofu soup, but it was excluded from their new dinner menu.  Ordered BBQ galbi ($18 for 6 pieces??), the classic blazing fire chicken and rice cake dish. Everything was very expensive. The taste was average at best.  They made a mistake in putting cheese on our blazing fire chicken, took it out to us and asked if we would still accept it. We sent it back, as one of our friends cannot handle eating cheese products well. It ended up taking 30 minutes to get our fire chicken. Taste was disappointing, and there was a burnt taste on our chicken.  Not going again."}
{"text":"If you're gonna order one thing here, get the fried chicken!!!! It's done well here, juicy chicken inside a properly crunchy skin, even when it's covered in that special korean fried chicken sweet sticky sauce.   We did take out of that and their signature blazing chicken, but everybody fought over the last pieces of the KFC while the blazing chicken sat lonely in the container...   I've eaten in once and take-out once. I wouldn't call the service friendly by any means, but it was adequate."}
{"text":"Whoa, I gotta add a review for this place since there's only one so far.  This place is excellent for korean fried chicken. I usually get half a chicken to share. Crispy skin on the outside, even when smothered in gooey yummy special sauce that apparently has 20 natural ingredients....?...! It's good. I get the HOT version because I find the regular too tame for my tastebuds.  It's happened twice so far though that I ordered the HOT version and they just gave me the regular version. I'm not gonna send it back cuz they're both good, but they need to get their orders straight.  Their oyster kimchi fried rice is a pretty good side if you want carbs in addition to the meaty goodness.  I am often just happy ordering the chicken!  I find it funny that they serve chopsticks/spoon to their Korean patrons and fork/spoon to their non-Korean patrons. Just an observation.   Don't forget to get your free korean coffee from up near the cash to complete the whole experience ^_^v"}
