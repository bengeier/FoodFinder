{"text":"Made me sick. Had the Brussels sprouts appetizer and bipimbap with chicken and started getting sick the same night. Didn't have any other food after that. 

The bipimbap itself was not good as it was bland - I have had better ones for much less in China Town. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Food was pretty tasty. Had the salmon tacos, lettuce wraps, brussel sprouts and bimibap. The server recommended two dishes per person and I think that is reasonable although if you're really hungry you'll need to order more as the portions aren't huge but to be expected considering it's more in keeping with a fine dining restaurant. Good ambience. Service was good. And they had soju!"}
{"text":"I would have given this restaurant, with great food, 4 stars, but the fact that they charge for water is a big black mark that deserves losing a star. I just don't understand why restaurants think it's okay to charge for basic still water. The irony is that on that night they charge no corkage for wine, oh well, next time!"}
{"text":"Anju has absolutely amazing servers who are passionate about the food there. The food is amazing and surprised us with a lot of clever combinations. Never in my life did I expect to like brussel sprouts so much.
Only downside is extremely small portions, so it quickly becomes really expensive due to having to order at least 2-3 dishes per person. The oxtail tortellini everyone raves about is an extremely small portion of 4 pieces. I can see the appeal, but it wasn't my favorite. Also I don't recommend the creme brulee for anyone with a sweet tooth. It tastes like those grocery store sesame snaps, but it might be good for people not wanting something sweet...? Aside from that, this restaurant is an awesome experience for anyone looking for new and unexpected dishes."}
{"text":"Highly overrated. I got the hot stone rice bowl and was very disappointed. The rice bowl had absolutely no flavor. Very small portions and very costly. Decent atmosphere and have some decent appetizers but again overpriced and very small amount of food. I will never be going here again."}
{"text":"It was really good food but I was constantly comparing it to traditional Korean food! I think if you want to step foot into Korean cuisine this is a good place. I think the prices were a bit high. They charge a few dollars for a plate of kimchi which is crazy.  Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Food generally good, waitress didn't stagger food enough for our table of seven so we had to keep making room for dishes, drinks expensive , gluten free charge bogus don't drive here no where to park!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in to try a few snacks on our way home from work. Had the salmon tacos, brussel sprouts, and halibut spring rolls. Service was good, food arrived fast. Really enjoyed the brussel sprouts but didn't realize there was going to be sausage in the dish. Would be fun with a group."}
{"text":"Disappointed with our brunch experience at Anju.  We've been there many times for dinner before and have never had any complaints.  Though the brunch menu was delicious, the overall experience was ruined by some value factors.  We ordered a side of fruit and bacon to start as we waited for our friends to join us.  $6 for an order of bacon got us about 4 strips of bacon, but what was worse was the $6 side order of fruit consisted of half an orange, one strawberry CUT IN HALF, one blackberry CUT IN HALF, and 2 blueberries.  SERIOUSLY?  You can't charge $6 for about 50 cents of fruit!   Surprised they didn't try to cut the blueberries in half. Then when I got my bill, I realized I had been charged $3 per coffee refill - and we were lingering on a lazy Sunday while a few people in our party enjoyed Caesars, so  a few refills costed me $12 in coffee alone.  This was not an americano or french press coffee, so one would not assume refills were additional since it is not customary in Calgary to charge for coffee refills.  A heads up by the server would have been appreciated.  Great food, but dampened by what felt like sneaky charges."}
{"text":"very expensive for what it is.  Hyped up korean-japanese tapas.  very bleh.  nothing inspiring.  Service ok.  Have given it three attempts.  Much better dining experiences available close by."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal here very much. It has a trendy atmosphere and nice decor. The food was excellent and the service was good, too. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Back and as good as ever.

The chef's tasting menu is amazing. At $45 per person,  you get around 6 dishes (big and small) with highlights including the ox tail tortellini,  oysters, wagyu skirt steak, and the grilled egg plant. Paired with aloe and yougurt sojus and you have the recipe for a beautiful dinner. 

The atmosphere is trendy, lively and casual with the focus on spirited conversation and delicious food. This is especially true at the communal chef's table where you will ohh and ahh with newly met table mates about each dish as passes by on its way to some lucky table.

It is not all perfect as the KFC (korean fried chicken) is not up to the caliber of the rest of the menu. If you are looking for a life changing fried chicken experience, Olive Chicken does it better. 

Overall, I am delighted that Roy and the team have found a new home on 17th ave and will be back regularly to taste their delicious creations."}
{"text":"The food at Anju is always amazing. The dishes are interesting, unique and they taste even better than they look. The atmosphere is gorgeous and calming, a really nice spot to go with girlfriends or a date. It is clear that management truly cares for the quality of both the food and service. It has quickly become a top choice on our list of Calgary restaurants to go to."}
{"text":"Everything was super flavourful and absolutely delicious. Awesome atmosphere, and very well-informed, helpful servers. A bit on the pricey side, we didn't leave full, but it's hard to complain when all the flavours were so bang on. Highly recommend the oxtail ravlioli and the gyoza. We also had the fried tofu, salmon tacos, and bimbambap, all of which were great."}
{"text":"Went for birthday dinner on a Friday night and I would like to share the experience. We had a large reso of 20 and they initially had us split into two tables which was very awkward so they managed to squeeze us at one table. That was pleasantly accommodating for us. The food was really good,  I had the oxtail and the KFC sliders (see pics). I also had a couple old fashions they were delicious . 

Everything was great up until we had to pay. They didn't split our bills and expected one person to cover the entire parties and figure it out later. I know places do this because it's conven for the servers. But is it a huge frustration for us patrons. We took over an hour to pay the one server that was very short with us and seemed annoyed. After we were all squared up she insisted that we were still $80 short and made the birthday girl cover the remainder. We in reality she had forgotten about a $100 bill one person gave her. She quickly realized her mistake and gave that cash to the birthday girl. The honesty was appreciate but the experience was already ruined. No patrons should have to sit down with a calculator after they've had a couple drinks and be expected to accurately add their items up. There has to be a better way Anju. If you're adding a 18% tip automatically, get it together and find a system that can track people separately."}
{"text":"First off have to say the fact of charging people a dollar per person for unlimited  Q water (glorified lukewarm  tap water ) is pretty sad IMO.
I would have preferred  good old Calgary tap water with a wee bit of ice .
 Now the food , most of it was very good but a lot of it was bland and very un seasoned.
Oxtail dumplings  were very good though very small portions.
The hanger steak tar tar was decent though quite bland and lacking seasoning, the chips on the side were ok but completely lacking seasoning.
The spicy squid on fried rice , was outstanding  and surprisingly the squid had enough seasoning .
Lettuce  wraps ( chicken and beef) portion size extremely small with the exception  of the huge bowl of white rice that you could never finish with the given amount of lettuce, protein and sauce.
Trout tacos, fish seemed well cooked but completely  lacking of seasoning , decent amount of fish but not nearly  enough slaw to make it though all the tacos , also I feel flour tortillas would be much better than corn.
Have to admit the KFC sliders  were outstanding no complaints  there ! 
The wait staff  were alright but nothing  to rave about .
Honestly  though considering that every thing on the menu is 15+ $ for tiny size really ditch the lame 1$ surcharge  on water .
Water that isn't even chilled and served without ice .....
I really doubt I would recommend  to friends ."}
{"text":"fantastic dinner!  coming from a city with great korean food, i was impressed by chef Roy.  he does a great job fusing classic korean flavors with high quality ingredients.  the brussel sprouts with crispy duk (=rice cake) was awesome.  we also loved the oxtail tortellini and the ssam.   my only wish is that chef roy was out in our town.  highly recommend checking out Anju!"}
{"text":"Anju is still one of the premier \"Asian fusion\" restaurants in Calgary. Food, drinks, drinking food, owner and chef Roy Oh has it covered.

AMBIENCE/SERVICE: Decent sized restaurant with dedicated walk-in seating if you can't get a reservation. Server was attentive, knowledgeable, and kept our glasses filled with their \"Q\" water. 2/2.5

FOOD: Tuna poke hand cones ($10 for 2) were excellent, with avocado, cucumber and tobiko. Spicy salmon tacos ($16 for 4) were also really good, with avocado, masago and seaweed on top. Also had the anju platter ($24 iirc) which was a special and included anchovies and fried squid among other dried seafood but everything was chewy and my jaw was sore by the end of it. I imagine this is something that goes better with alcohol and I blame myself for not getting the oxtail tortellini or crispy tofu, which were incredible at Anju's former location. 2/2.5"}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I went to this Korean food restaurant for lunch. One friend had been here a few times and suggested we would like it.

They had completely gutted and redid the interior since I last visited the restaurant previously at this location. It's now quite modern, has a good view into the kitchen, and is just a really nice place to sit-down.

Although officially Korean, it's got a bit of a diverse almost fusion menu. We had Tofu with pork belly as an appetizer for a starter, then shared three mains between the 3 of us: Beef Bibimbap, Shrimp curry and Lettuce wrap with pork belly as protein. The food was presented well, but most importantly was amazing - some of the best Korean I've had.

In the end, it was just over $80 for an appetizer, 3 mains and 3 beers.

This place is supposed to be incredibly busy every evening so you should probably make reservations if coming later."}
{"text":"Looooooved this place. The food, style, waitress, drinks. 
Upscale and a bit pricy but admit was it delicious!!!! I'd go back often."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The vibe was great, the food was even better and our waiter was very friendly and helped us understand the menu. I highly recommend the crispy tofu, the Brussel sprouts (I am not usually a fan, but these were amazing) the fried chicken and save room for dessert because the chocolate zucchini cake with coconut ice cream was to die for. It's also worth asking for help with the cocktail list, the staff has great recommendations. Definitely worth the price for a good night out where you can share and taste all kinds of different dishes."}
{"text":"I've been to Anju twice now, and both times I was very impressed with everything I ate.

As a tapas style place, I would recommend trying a few dishes to share - there are so many great things to choose from it would be hard to pick just one. I think my favourite so far was the octopus - just spicy enough, and more tender than any octopus I've ever had. The bibimbap is hearty and flavourful, and the cocktails are strong and tasty. I can't get enough!

The service was pretty bad the first time around, with the waitress uninterested in answering simple questions about soju and how big the portions were. We wanted to make sure we had enough food/not too much food between two people but she kind of wasn't sure. The second time our waitress was fantastic and helpful, but not overbearing. I would honestly probably go again even if the service was worse than the first time. 

I've only been for the dinner, but plan to come in for lunch one of these days."}
{"text":"Service is not good at all, they didn't even say thank you after we paid and food is just so so and overly overprice . We ordered oxtail tortellini and white tiger rolls. The oxtail tortellini was just okay-ish nothing special. The white tiger rolls were good if you have big mouth as the rolls are giant in size."}
{"text":"Crazy pricy and crazy small portion. The food tastes good but definitely can eat 5 of those $20 dish so I can be reasonably full."}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot a couple of years ago (mostly in their original location and a few times in the new location). Not sure why we stopped coming because it was always outstanding, but we decided to try it again. How things have changed! They've removed their cult favourite KFC chicken and waffles from the menu, and everything we tried was just mediocre to bad. The kimchi was the worst I've ever had (not tangy or spicy, just salty) and the burger was some WAY over-salted brisket with salty bacon on top. Salt-fest. Inedible. (And $25!) Our server was super nice, so we felt bad complaining, and just gave our burger to a homeless guy on the way home. I miss the old Anju."}
{"text":"Really liked the wings, however, the lamp was a rip off! the smallest piece of lamb with no meat on the bone"}
{"text":"Anju is my new favourite restaurant in Calgary! Everything from the service, to atmosphere, to the quality of food is impeccable! Anju got me into Yelping again. I was getting tired of always having to write a negative aspect about my experience but for once a restaurant has proven that a genuinely positive dining experience exists. Jessica Keay was exceptional at describing the dishes and getting all the information necessary to recommend the best choices for us. Things to die for include the sweet potatoes fries, the KFC (Korean fried chicken), and the creme brûlée. The food was authentic to Korea (yes, I lived there for a year) with a modern flare. All dishes had a burst of flavor and unique textures that I've never experienced before. If you go once, you won't be able to resist going a millions times more!"}
{"text":"Nothing but positive words come to mind when I think about Anju. I've loved this place since they were at their old location at the further west end of downtown, so it was not a surprise to me that they moved to a bigger and better venue.

The tapas style menu allows you to try all of everything they have to offer, and trust me, I've come close to doing that! Their spicy salmon tacos, chicken wings (get the gochujang sauce on the side if you want a bit of heat) and the crispy tofu are my top picks. Each plate is explosive with flavor and makes you wanting more - or coming back again if you overeaten and there's still things you want to try (like I've done many times)

This place is usually pretty busy, but once you get in, you'll understand why and know it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic. I say at the bar and got great service and a couple delicious cocktails. I recommended getting the reading menu and just enjoy something different and delicious."}
{"text":"I went to Anju to celebrate my birthday and had a fantastic time! There were 8 of us and I made the reservation far in advance, and the table was set and ready for us when we arrived. The restaurant has a really cool laid back vibe.

The Jinro 24 Soju was a hit at the table and really kept the night lively. I preferred the aloe topper over the mango but both went well with the drink. We all ordered a couple dishes and the whole table got to try a little of everything which was perfect! The Korean chicken wings, Brussels sprouts and KFC sliders were big hits. The sashimi was also a favourite. I also really liked the dish with the sweet potato noodles. 

The service was wonderful. Our servers were friendly and great at recommending/ explaining dishes. They also served up my birthday cake for me with a small cake cutting fee. 

Anju is now a new favourite Calgary restaurant of mine and I can't wait to go back:)"}
{"text":"I'm in love with Anju! I've been a fan since before they moved to their current 17th Ave space, and very consistently, I've had many great meals here!

I've gone to Anju several times before: for dinner, late night, and weekend brunch. They stick fairly close to their namesake, serving mainly smaller plates for enjoying with alcohol. In other words tapas or izakaya style. Anju does offer larger mains on their dinner menu but I very much enjoy the smaller plates and sharing style of eating. You get to try so much more food that way. ;)

Everything at Anju does of course pair great with drinks. Be it soju or cocktails or beer or wine, whatever you please, with or without alcohol. Their friendly staff is always happy to answer pairing questions or any other menu questions. Service at Anju has always been top notch.

Now, I haven't been blown away by everything I've eaten at Anju, but I have had some formative food moments there! That's always a rare and magical thing and it takes a lot for any restaurant to be SO good that you feel like you hadn't tasted real food before that point!

But hyperbole aside, one mind blowing moment for me was when I had Anju's KFC for the first time. ;) That's Korean Fried Chicken w/ gochujang sauce. They're quite possibly the best hot wings in the city! I never realized that the standard pub hot wing could be elevated in such an awesome way without becoming stuffy \"fine dining!\" That might sound odd or obvious, but this was a new concept for me at the time! 

Anju occasionally changes how they manifest this chicken dish. Whether it's in slider form or as wings, this is a must try! No joke, I love them!

My next favourite would be pretty much anything on their late night menu! They don't offer the menu all the time, but if you have a chance to try it out, I highly recommend you take it! (Usually starting at 11pm.) It's all that good craving inducing, bad for your body, good for your soul type food! Eg: Korean cheesesteak or spicy rice cake with ramen noodles. You get what I mean! ;p

Another dish I recommend is their hanger steak tartare. It's Anju's take/nod to/shoutout to the Korean raw beef dish: Yuk Hwae. Anju's version includes Korean pear, a quail egg, smoked bone marrow, pine nuts, soy and sesame. Yum!

Along with the KFC, another cult favourite is their oxtail tortellini, aka beef dumplings, aka sogori mandu. Hop onto Instagram if you want many, many shots of this dish from many, many people! It is very tasty, but wait... I'm going to say something controversial now: as much as I love the tortellini at Anju, I personally feel that Shokunin makes a better dumpling! *shock*

Now, that's just my very subjective tastes! You'll have to try them both out yourself to see if you agree! ;p

In general, it is hard to go wrong at Anju! You will probably need a reservation if you're going on a busy night (Friday or Saturday especially.) But this place is a local favourite for a reason. Chef Roy creates some truly soul warming food. I mean who doesn't feel cared for after a delicious hot stone bowl meal, or some good crispy double smoked bacon! Please try this place, enjoy the deliciousness, add to the Instagram tortellini stack if the mood strikes you, and have a great time! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my experience at Anju - we had a friendly server who gave us great ordering recommendations. I completely recommend both the crispy tofu and the braised sablefish. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Unfortunately their cocktails were not available at this time but the food was excellent. The brussel sprouts were the best thing we ate for sure! We got many dishes to share with the group and everything was great except I would not recommend the lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"it is quite nice place for BFFs hang out. definetely needed reservation for weekend dinner. it's rather fusion than tranditional korean. tapas were shared by six people.  40/pp including tips wasn't too bad"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to order for take out so I followed all of Justin's suggestions and am glad I did.  Out of this world.

The words \"I'd murder someone for those Brussels Sprouts\" were heard.  The shishito peppers were almost as good!!!!  The Stone bowl rice dish was excellent as well.

Next time, no take out, and will eat at the restaurant."}
{"text":"There was so much hype about this place but turned out to be regular for me. There's nothing special about the place or the food! Ate exactly what my friend raved about & nothing extraordinary"}
{"text":"The Crispy Tofu was amazing, def worth checking out."}
{"text":"Anju earned its five stars in spite of some organizational glitches. The food was all marvelously interesting, with flavorings echoing the far reaches of the globe. This kitchen is preparing world class, Michelin quality, James Beard award winning dishes. Yet, there is a lack of polish about the restaurant, which is disappointing considering the culinary treasures produced by the chefs. 

Our problem started at \"the front.\" Two young women, looking frazzled and defensive, first could not find our reservation. Once our name was discovered, the one seemingly in charge, looked past me into the lounge and said our table was not ready. I asked if we could sit at the bar, and she said all seats were taken for at least 30 minutes.  She never checked with the bartender. Also, she never looked at me, never making eye contact, no smiles, no welcome. Suddenly, she grabbed two menus and led us to a \"walk in\" table in the lounge in front of the bar. I asked if a table was available in the restaurant, and she haughtily said this is the restaurant. I told her I meant the main dining room, and she simply said no. 

My wife and I then waited an inordinate amount of time.  I was in the restaurant business in Milwaukee, and as a former owner/manager I knew what was going on.  No one was assigned to our table.  We were just about to walk out, when a young man named Matthew stopped by and asked if we've been helped.  He was very empathetic. Two minutes later a young woman came by to be our server, and I told her we've been taken care of. 
Matthew was great and led us through the huge menu. The fried tofu, oxtail tortellini, curry seafood, and fried brussel sprouts were all flavorful and delicious, and each of us had separate favorites. We had a wonderful meal.
Matthew was great.  Oh, BTW, five minutes after we sat down, there were several empty seats at the bar.

At the end of the meal, I called the manager over to compliment Matthew. The manager, as good managers will do, was more concerned about the problems.  He gave us 10% off our meal which was unnecessary, and we made it up on the tip. I'm glad the manager was so attentive.  

Anju has the potential to be one of the best restaurants in North America.  However, great restaurants require a commitment to the whole operation. Fantastic food is often not enough.  With some fine tuning, concentrating on staffing and design, (the decor and ambiance need work) Anju would make every world class list. The food was that good."}
{"text":"Korean-fusion with delicious small plates, and craft cocktails! Very fun place to dine with friends!"}
{"text":"Best food I've had in Calgary! We tried it for the first time last night and we were so happy we did! We weren't really sure what to order when we first read the menu, but we asked our server for suggestions and she was so informative! We ordered all her suggestions and our food was phenomenal! I will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Came by Anju on Sunday afternoon for a bite with one of the besties, there was no wait and we got seated right away.

Our server was laid back, super friendly and promptly got us our adult bevvies. (If it's noon, it's ok right?) I was a bit disappointed however that the menu was downsized to a brunch, but I think that's to be expected on the weekends. 
After perusing the menu I decided to go with the lettuce wraps with chicken. 

The presentation was nice and the portion was generous. I asked for a hot sauce (because I love spice... GIVE IT TO ME HOT!) but they didn't actually have anything spicier than what they already give you with your meal... which I found strange for a Korean place.

Anyways, the meal didn't blow my mind but I wouldn't mind going back to try their regular menu and see what that's all about.... Maybe they can make me a hotter dish."}
{"text":"Excellent food and environment! The crispy tofu was something from the heaven . Good customer service too ...Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Anju is one of those restaurants that I can go back to time and time again and never get tired of their menu. There's so much to choose from that it's almost best to go with a big group so that you can order a bunch of dishes and have a taste of everything! Tonight's visit was a quick late night bite so we ordered our favorites: spicy salmon tacos, oxtail tortellini, gochujang wings and pork belly lettuce wraps. I was happy to see that even at 9pm the restaurant was busy, but we were still able to get a table for 3 without reservations. The service was impeccable and the food arrives pretty fast so you're not sitting there too long before you have your first bite of deliciousness! I love this place so much that during dinner I made reservations for Sunday night"}
{"text":"pretty interesting restaurant with good potential, but misses the mark on execution on several dishes as well as generally weird attitude from servers. ordered several apps and a few main dishes to share. the food came pretty quick and sushi hand rools, fried brussel sprouts, were good, kimchi was just average (probably form costco). the mains included some fresh market fish, dolsot bap, veggies with lamb. the mains were pretty good, while the cod was pretty strange tasting. we sent it back and the chefs, manager, server fought back and told us that its just the way it tastes. What we learned later is that the fresh fish is actually cured, not fresh ! so that was a bit of miscommunication and given the less than perfect handling of this issue, I can't really say anything nice about the service, although they did wave the charge after several minutes and rounds of arguing. Finally, the prices are almost at NYC level, which for this restaurant is ridiculous. So all in all, a bit of a disappointment so I wont be back."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical of this Korean-fusion restaurant, but ended up pleasantly surprised. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful in giving us recommendations. We ended up ordering all of them and no regrets.

Oxtail tortellini - it was a little too mushy for my liking, but my fiance loved it.

Crispy tofu - both of our favorite dishes. The fried kimchi and pork belly along with the aioli sauce and fried tofu worked well together. Yummy.

Eggs Benny - probably my second favorite. A classic eggs benedict with fried kimchi and pork belly."}
{"text":"This place had horrifyingly bad service. My spouse and I arrived at 1 pm on Monday, and despite the fact that it was mostly empty we had to seat ourselves and ultimately leave when no one came to take our order, 15 minutes later. This, even though there was no shortage of staff standing around talking. Truly unbelievable."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to the 'new' Anju.  The food doesn't seem to have changed. It's still very well done. We enjoyed a number of our old favourite small plates, all excellent; mini spicy salmon tacos, crispy tofu, pork/prawn potstickers, edamame, chicken lettuce wraps and seaweed wafers. I can't get enough of that hot mustard oil served with the wafers! We were a little disappointed in the amount of chicken that came with the lettuce wraps. It was a pretty small amount, supplemented by rice. I'd prefer more meat. But they were still delicious and came with a nice array of sauces. I had never had bibimbap before. And probably never will again. I didn't care for this dish at all. The presentation was nice but once mixed together is was just a bowl of mush. Probably enjoyable for some, but just not my thing.

I said it when this restaurant was Petite and I'll say it again. The acoustics in this space are terrible! While Petite tried to muffle the sound a little with softer furnishings and padding, Anju has done none of that. Probably because it didn't really work. I don't know how you fix a problem like that but having to yell at your table-mates and serving staff for the entire evening is so very taxing. I realize that restaurants can get loud but plan to leave here with a hoarse voice. If you have hearing difficulties, you will struggle.

Of course I'll be back because of the great food and service, but it won't be my 'go to' place only because of the sound. You need patience for that. Some days I'm just not up for that."}
{"text":"One of the best Korean restaurants in town!
Great ambience = 4.5
Good price = 4
Excellent taste = 5
Amazing service = 4.5

I would definitely go back again. 

Highly recommend the oyster platter. 

The kimchi is divine. 

The steak lettuce wrap is incredible."}
{"text":"First time I went here was with a group of guys for dinner and pre-gaming before a Flames game. The food was amazing! Everything we had was so incredible we were ordering doubles and triples. The soju with aloe was a tasty addition I would highly recommend as well. The service was exceptional; our food came out quickly and well spread out and our server was a beauty. I would definitely go back to anju again."}
{"text":"Truly one of the best restaurants in Calgary.  The sliders and wings are to die for!"}
{"text":"I am so glad your back and somehow the food got better! 
Went in for dinner and had to wait as it was so busy. But was it worth the wait? Absolutely! They still have favorites from the old restaurant and then so many new delicious items. The baked oysters are phenomenal and oxtail tortellini is still as delicious. Good selection of wines to compliment the food and some killer cocktails. 
Anju I am glad you are back. I will absolutely see you again!"}
{"text":"Luckily, I got to try lots of tasty eats on my visit here. The fried tofu is incredible. The grilled asparagus is yummy, but not great value. KFC sliders were very KFC like. Lettuce Wraps made a good vegetarian option for my friend and come with really good garlic potato chips. My dinner was a chicken hot stone rice bowl (bibimbap). The portions were excellent and I even had leftovers for a full lunch the next day. Really like the takeout containers which are recyclable and low waste #itsthelittlethings."}
{"text":"I can't rave enough about Anju! My husband and I chose to eat at the bar and service was excellent. The bartenders were knowledgeable and friendly. All the food and drinks were fantastic - we ordered the spicy scallop sashimi, oxtail tortellini, and the spicy ramen bolognese to eat and the shin ramen caesar and lock, stock & two smoking barrels to drink. Everything was delicious! We will definitely make another visit to Anju if we are ever back in Calgary."}
{"text":"LOVE the fried chicken and cornbread! My friends took me here for a birthday dinner for my first time.

food was delicious and atmosphere was comfortable. Service is a little slow but not terribly so - just not a good place if you are in a rush.

we also had the oxtail ravioli and brussel sprouts. no complaints about the food!"}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with this restaurant. The food was quite simple and nothing truly new. I might go back but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"One of our favourite places to eat.  Incredible food with amazing infused flavours.  This restaurant is better suited for a group of 4 or more, (only so you can try a variety off the menu) 
We are a huge fan and recommend it to anyone visiting YYC."}
{"text":"Taking classic comfort Korean dishes and putting a modern unique spin, Anju brings the liveliness of classic Korean dining with an upscale approach. Planted on the corner of 4th St on 17th, the mod detail of the exterior is as simplistic as it can get, but once you walk through those doors you're welcomed into an exceptional space. Meticulous detailing from wall to wall, I'm glad we came for brunch and was able to admire the space with all the natural light flooding in. 

Brunch menu is only available Saturday and Sunday from 11-3. 
Tonkatsu - ($17) -  - I'm going to get so much hate for ordering this but listen, I was craving rice and deep fried anything; AND IT WAS GOOD. This came with deep fried breaded pork drizzled with a sweet savory sauce, side of rice, salad and miso soup. Pork was crispy and crunchy and oh-so very satisfying, the salad had a light dressing but the miso soup was overly salty. Way too salty. Good portion size over all. 
Breakfast Hashstone Bowl - ($18) - 5/5 - *opted for the kabayaki chicken. Served in a hot clay bowl, veggies with a mix of protein piled onto potatoes with 2 eggs, the best part of this dish? KIMCHI HOLLANDAISE. 'Nough said. 

Service was hands off but friendly, made sure to be by to take plates away or to top up drinks but the atmosphere itself tied in with the service, very casual and relaxed. 
Brunch was definitely on the heavier side and we only got a taste of what Anju offers.. This will not be our last time visiting, can't wait to try out their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"These guys were great.  Really different and healthy food.  My cousin and I went on a Friday night.  It was packed.  I loved the tofu dish.  I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic experience here while visiting town. 

Our table opted for the Halibut spring rolls, which I'd HIGHLY recommend to anyone. What I appreciated was the description of the dish when it arrived at the table, as well - it showcased the server knowledge and the care in how they serve their guests. They tasted amazing. 

Although there are a lot of creative dishes on the menu, all three of us opted for variations on the Bim Bim Bap, which may seem amateur or even dull considering the cool range of options on the menu, but really, it's a classic choice, and Anju does an amazing job with it. The protein is specially seasoned, and the range of veggie toppings are clearly carefully selected.

An amazing meal that won't be soon forgotten in a location I'd recommend to anyone in town."}
{"text":"Rivals model milk in both the quality of the food and the scene. Korean fusion food with an original spin. The spicy salmon tacos, the shrimp tempura and the kimchi fried rice are a must. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere even though it was a bit on the loud side. The service was top notch and was impressed with the taste of the various dishes that were ordered. I recommend this place and would definitely go back!! : )"}
{"text":"Great food overall. They were out of the signature eggplant which I had really wanted to try so that was disappointing. They let us order it but then much later on in the night informed us they ran out so I'm guessing the way the waitress spaced our meal caused us to miss it which was a huge disappointment. Most dishes were great, others just ok. Waitress was very slow and probably had too many tables for her abilities but she was very nice and friendly. The room has terrible acoustics and it was hard to hear our friends across the table. A visually nice restaurant though. I'll try it again for sure."}
{"text":"Wow...  amazing food.  The truffle fries are unreal.  Looking forward to my next trip to Calgary."}
{"text":"If not for the ambiance, I would give this a lower star. Overpriced small dishes, like a Korean tapas bar... You're better off going to a Korean restaurant and getting full size dishes for less. They charge you for water even if you don't have any as my date ordered tea and still got charge for water, as that is their standard policy. Short ribs we had were over salted and lacking in flavour. Black cod dish for $20 was the size of a golf ball. It's a trendy restaurant, but dropped $100 for two people and left feeling hungry still."}
{"text":"I was here last Friday night for one of 2 bday dinners for my cute hubby- the other restaurant  ( Rouge - didn't fare so well - check out my other review).  We arrived early due to the torrential rain and were promptly seated even though the place was packed. We had a great 4 top with a comfy bench. 
 Our server was Dana - a very nice - \"cool\" young lady with tats and a mound of great hair piled on her head. She explained how the menu worked and I explained that I was a vegetarian and she said that it was no problem. I was relieved as the menu didnt look too approachable for me - but this restaurant was for my beloved - not me.  
We started with some house specialties - modified with meat bits on the side - first the Brussel sprouts-  I cant tell you how effing good these were - crunchy - sweet, savoury and delicious.  We also had some asian nuts - yah yah, I know theres a joke in there somewhere- but they were savory with wasabi and soy and so good. - As well another house specialty was the crispy tofu really good - with different layers of flavours. Although I didnt have any, apparently the kimchi was nice too! 
Onto to the mains- here is where things went downhill a bit... my partner ordered the bibimbap - it arrived in a stinkin hot stone bowl  which is customary - but the rice should have had a crispy bottom - but it remained soft, and all in all the bibimbap while pretty was pretty average - bordering on stodgy. 
I ordered lettuce wraps with tofu.  Disappointing.  The accompaniments were simply tiny slices of dried garlic, serrano chilis and 2 sauces both of which were savory - a sesame oil and a miso soy. I requested a sweeter sauce which they gave me. 
I have had much better elsewhere. 
The dessert however was amazing, the chefs take on an Eatmore chocolate bar. It was incredible. 
All in all though - the energy of the restaurant - the great service, the vibe, the amazing menu make this restaurant a winner.  I look forward to returning -however in the future I think we will stick to a lot of little appies and perhaps split a veggie based main. 
It's little reason this restaurant is a consistent favourite with so many.  It felt like you were in an elite club where food is also one of your friends for the evening."}
{"text":"The oxtail tortellini was great. Fried brussell sprouts were also highly enjoyed. Service was awesome and will for sure return."}
{"text":"Randomly stopped by this place on our one night in Calgary. 

Out of a 5 week trip throughout the Pacific Northwest including cities like Portland and Vancouver, this was one of our best meals. The place is cute and service is good also. 

We had the salmon tacos - delicious, brussels sprouts - perfectly crispy and in a super tasty sauce; the fried tofu with pork belly - wonderfully cooked with just the right texture; and the oxtail pasta - delicate and fresh pasta bursting with flavor.

The chocolate dessert was really good but just not our thing with the wasabi cream. 

If you get these you can't go wrong. The portion sizes are decent for a small plates place too."}
{"text":"ANJU is a Korean inspired restaurant. I went for brunch and had the eggs benny with shrimp and avocado, and the mushroom toast. Both were AMAZING (although the eggs benny was a bit better). 

Staff were very friendly and wait times for food were normal. 

Recommended this restaurant to several friends already and highly recommend it if you can make it out to downtown Calgary."}
{"text":"Waiter was super nice and polite. The food was good. The beef tartar and spicy salmon tacos were the best."}
{"text":"Been here first time on June 2016 as recommended by the staff of the hotel we stayed. I tried almost all the special of their Korean Cuisine but nothing seem to compliment of what a real Korean food. I tried so hard to appreciate of what the hotel staff said was good. I don't know but 2 star is the rate."}
{"text":"Really great service and delicious Asian fusion tapas style eating! There wasn't one thing that we ordered that wasn't great!"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend to book a reservation ahead of time, since the place was quite busy for 8:30 pm on a Wednesday. 

Started off first with the sushi hand cones which were actually the reason I decided to give this place a 4 instead of a 5 star. The cone just honestly tasted like a tuna fish sandwich with seaweed wrapping instead of bread. 

The white tiger roll did not disappoint. It was a great combination of different ingredients and flavours that worked in harmony together with just a little bit of kick. 

I also ordered the sweet potato noodles which were very flavourful as well. The beef pieces that came with it and the beef short ribs were both cooked perfectly and extremely juicy and tender. 

Service was great with friendly staff and attentive servers. The atmosphere is modern and inviting. It's the perfect place for get togethers and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I first ate at Anju when it occupied a house on 10 St. SW. I thought the food was good and probably would have given it a 4-star based on what I had tasted but this time the food was spectacular.
The new Anju is located in the place that once was one of my favourite Italian restaurants (Il Giardiano) until owner Mike Ciccaglione decided it was time to move on. It's right on the corner of 4th and 17th Ave SW. The place is noisy and just hums with energy.
Anju classifies itself as Korean Tapas but there are what they term Large Format items such as Whole Market Fish, Braised Short Ribs and Bo Ssam. These range from market price for the fish to $45-$250. $250 you say???? Well that's for the Bo Ssam which is slow roasted pork shoulder but it feeds up to 8 people and requires 48 hours' notice. 
The Bo Ssam is what I'm here for. We each order a tapas dish to tide us over till the main course. I ordered a side of Grilled Asian Eggplant. I loved the eggplant, subtly seasoned with soy, gochugaru and rice vinegar. The Honey Garlic Anchovies had what I call the \"peanut chips allure\" to them, you couldn't stop at one taste, you had to keep eating till the bowl was empty.
The pork is pull-apart tender and served with rice, lettuce and condiments. It's finger food as you make up a wrap with the lettuce and stuff it with rice, pork and condiments. There is no elegant way to eat this; dig in and enjoy! The pork is flavourful and the different condiments makes it seem like you are having 3-4 dishes as you experiment with the different sauces and combinations. 
The special dessert of the day was a pound cake served with persimmon slices and crème fraiche, the cake was lightly toasted but still moist on the inside, absolutely delicious!
Korean food can have very strong flavours but what I like about Anju is that the flavours are subtle and well matched. It's not a cheap place to eat but worth the price. You can look at spending anywhere from $35-60 per person without drinks easily.
Service was efficient and friendly. In case you're wondering how the bill works out for the Bo Ssam, the restaurant charges you for 1/8 and then tags on anything you ordered for yourself. Works out great for groups as no one has to figure who owes what."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Anju for dinner not too long ago. The service was awful. Our waitress completely forgot about us. 20 minutes in we still didn't even have our drinks. Once we ordered, the food took around 50 minutes to arrive. When we received the food, the order wasn't not all correct. After eating multiple tapas orders and even the large seafood platter... we were still starving. The small portions and food was not filling and were quite expensive once added up. We went out for more food after. I wouldn't recommend it or return."}
{"text":"Anju is just basically trendy Asian leaning towards Korean cuisine. Not bad but honestly not amazing either. Just your typical trendy Asian spot with over-sauced and overly fried dishes. We ordered the panfried dumplings, oxtail tortellini, side of kimchi, and the bibimbap. The dumplings were good but were served facing down in a bowl of soy/chili sauce. I love sauce but i dont want my food drowning in it. The sides were super crispy which was nice though. The tortellini was a bit on the salty side but had good flavor and the bibimbap was good. Not sure how easy it is to mess up bibimbap though."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to anju every once in awhile with my friends. The last visit I had made me rethink coming back. I do recommend getting the Brussel sprouts and the gochujang wings however. Usually the servers are quite friendly but the service we received last time was strange and awkward.

I would recommend that whoever comes up with new menu items, take a step back and go back to the basics. The simpler the better. And rather than throw gochujang in every dish, find some more flavour profiles. If ever single dessert has some sort of strange ingredient like soy sauce, it means you're trying to hard.

I do not recommend their beef carpaccio or lingcod, or nori fries. Our group wasn't very impressed by the ramen broth either."}
{"text":"So happy to have Anju back on the yyc foodie scene! Amazing food and service as always! Love the space and decor of the new location. Tried some new items on my first visit back to the restaurant and my absolute fave of the night was the foie gras & tofu. I just recently fell in love with foie gras and Anju's is definitely one of my faves so far - creamy, melt in your mouth goodness and the pistachios added nice texture. Couldn't go wrong serving them with brioche!

Can't wait until my next visit!!"}
{"text":"I can't say I love Anju but I don't hate it either. I think it's a cool little spot on the corner of 17th ave and 4th. I like that they are opened late and even have a late night menu. 

I know what traditional Korean food is and I know that most of the dishes at Anju are not authentic Korean food. The whole point of the restaurant is to be fusion Korean food.. And maybe I'm too used to traditional Korean food to have a liking for the fusion stuff. 

A few dishes that I did enjoy were the tuna tacos, the tofu and pork belly dish, the octopus (cooked soo tender!) and the beef tataki. Some dishes I didn't enjoy, I'm not sure if it's just due to my preference and/or because the tastes of the Korean spices just don't work together. All the dessert dishes sounded so asian and was kind of a turn off.. We opted for the white chocolate dish with sesame brittles and I did not enjoy it at all. Couldn't taste the white chocolate in the dish. 

Anyway, all in all, I think the place is a hip cool place to hang out, maybe grab some small bites and/or sharing plates, and get some drinks but please don't go here if you are looking for authentic Korean food and/or Korean bbq."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars.  Let me start with the good points, from lunch today with 2 mom friends - we all enjoy the family style dining, this time Korean tapas, as we get to taste it all!
- friendly service, attentive to filling our waters, answering our questions and request to turn the music volume down (), they were polite.  
- love the decor
- fried Brussel sprouts- I usually am \"meh\" about Brussel sprouts, but this was my second fav dish today - lovely textures and flavours with the bacon, rice sticks and soy maple syrup (cuz who doesn't adore sweet and salty?!?!)
- crispy tofu- my fav dish!  Who knew tofu could cook up so tasty- and add kimchi and pork belly- delicious!!
- KFC sliders were yummy-Korean fried chicken is never a bad choice, and with a smidge less sauce, I would have enjoyed them more.  Also didn't need the bun, the bread didn't add to the slider taste-wise, seemed more for aesthetics (to make it a slider).
- sesame chicken salad was great- interesting dressing, variety of textures and tasty chicken.  

Now here is where they lost 1 star- the bibimbap rice bowl. The ingredients were interesting and tasted nice, but really needed the sauce (served as a side, to accommodate individual preferences for heat).  Without the sauce, the bowl was underseasoned and underwhelming.  Also, while the stone bowl was hot, there was too much moisture (I think) that prevented the rice from crisping.  I love bibimbap for the crispy rice at the bottom of the bowl- none here.  I've had better bibimbap elsewhere."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!

I tried 2 items....
Tempura mushrooms- OMG this was the best thing I've had in a month of Sundays! I kid you not, tasty tempera batter, amazingly firm mushrooms for being fried, and the dipping sauce was goin' on! Mushrooms were so good the sauce wasn't even needed.  10/10!

The other item was a seafood bowl with yellow curry. Forget the name at the moment. Shrimp, clams, and calamari were on point, cooked perfect. Noodles were tasty, yellow curry left something to be desired but all in all an 8/10.

Service was great. Friendly, helpful, and inquisitive. Place was slammed on a Wednesday night but they seated me quickly and took good care. 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"My top place for a special occasion meal.  Got to try this place out during big taste 2016 at lunch and was so impressed by our server and the menu.  He was able to accommodate everything for a pescatarian diet and was a delightful man. I could not get the food out of my head either - every bite was a treat. Went back in 2017 for dinner and it was even better than I remembered.  Always recommend this place for anyone looking for something different and consistently delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm a little late with posting this, but figured better late than never! :) Anju hosted a bachelorette party dinner for my sister in late June and everyone had an incredible time. As the maid of honor, I was in charge of finding a restaurant with unique/delicious dishes, a chic yet relaxed atmosphere (without pretentious service), reasonably priced, and one that could accommodate 14 people who had a TON of food allergies/restrictions haha Anju went above and beyond all of my expectations! 

Karina (manager), Jeremy, and Cody were absolutely wonderful to work with when planning the dinner. Although my sister lives in Calgary, I live all the way in Texas. Despite the distance, all of the aforementioned people made planning this event so much easier. If you're looking for a restaurant to host a nice dinner event, Anju is the place for you! Throughout the night, everyone was raving about the food/drinks. The oxtail tortellini, fried brussels sprouts, seafood curry ramen nest, and daikon chocolate cake are a MUST. Plus, the servers were so attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. I cannot thank y'all enough for making my sister's special event so memorable! I will be sure to stop by for dinner the next time I visit Calgary!"}
{"text":"Food - it's my own doing for not noticing the word tapas. Korean tapas? Keep in mind that I am not even comparing food here with traditional Korean cuisine, since it's claimed to be fusion. But for the price point and portion, I was surprised that even the basic execution was lacking. If I go to a restaurant, I expect certain quality of food (like no overdone or burned food at least?). My husband and I order the following dishes: 

Kimchi steamed bun (daily special) - It's okay. The dough skin was soggy. Such an amateur mistake.

Asparagus tempura - This is delicious. 

Fried Brussels sprouts - Dont. Even. Bother. I convinced my husband to try this because other reviewers were raving about it but, as you know, you can't trust them all. Brussel sprouts were too charred and burned, and way overseasoned. It's extremely salty and sweet and greasy. Sigh.

Lettuce wraps \"Ssam\" - The only thing that's praise worthy about this dish is the perfectly done meat. But for 19 CAD, I expect at least more than a few sad bites of meat
 
Spicy squid fried rice - This is the star of our dinner. Everything about this dish was executed so poorly I don't even know where to start. First of all it's not squid fried rice. It's fried squid and some wet rice. I barely tasted the squid because it's over battered and overdone so the texture was rubbery. The fried rice? Soggy with a lot of grease at the bottom of plate. 

Ambience- very nice lighting and decoration inside. However, I have a little suggestion to the restaurant: keep the door to patio open and improve your ventilation. Smoke from cooking was visible inside the restaurant.  

Highly recommended for people who have never had good Asian food and would like to spend a lot of money for little portion of food with amateur mistakes. :)"}
{"text":"My first visit at Anju and I'm still here.
The oysters were delicious,
The oxtail tortellini was absolutely divine. So rich and flavourful.

I'm not one for dessert (I don't have a sweet-tooth) but I tried the chocolate cream pie and OH my god. The wasabi cream is genius. The chocolate is really delicious, and the nori notes are perfect for my preference  for salty-sweet.

I am so in love! Can't wait to come back and try the bibimbap :)

I left some photos."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Calgary! Both the food and drinks are delicious. Korean, European and North American flavours are fused together into a variety of interesting dishes. I had the Bibimbap and a Hand Cone. Both were amazing!! 

For drinks I had a Ceasar and a Whiskey Cocktail (think it was called: Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels). The drink are perfectly flavoured and the alcohol content...generous. 

We'll definitely return...one of Calgary's very best!"}
{"text":"I think this place well deserves to get 5 stars; great atmosphere, amazing food, professional service and good price for a good food; it might be on the higher side in terms of pricing but you are paying for a well prepared, professionally designed dishes in a live atmosphere.
This is a Korean restaurant with tapas style menu that allows you to try different things and share if you want.
Lots of options to choose from but the Crispy Tofu was amazing, the Chicken Wings were just cooked in perfection and the Salmon Tacos were also super delicious. 
Again it's not cheap but worth the price."}
{"text":"I would label the food Whitewashed Korean... However, it tasted good regardless. The atmosphere was very loud, I could barely hear the waitress so I simply nodded. Apart from that I'd say it was a good place to eat at."}
{"text":"one of my go-to placed in town.  I was exposed to Korean food while living in Vancouver and so when I heard that Anju had bibimbap, I had to try it....wow.  worth the visit.

also notable:

1. craft cocktails - bartenders choice
2. cool music
3. have never had to wait for a table
4. late night options
5. sunworks chicken wings (szechuan!) are amazing
6. bibimbap...gotta do it
7. efficient service
8. good portion sizes for sharing
9. Salmon Tacos...I think I might go back for these right now"}
{"text":"I'd probably give this around 3.5 stars - it's Korean-tapas, with a modern-American/Canadian twist on things but I found myself expecting more in some of the dishes, and some dishes were hit or miss.

Crispy Tofu & Pork Belly ($14) - This was my fiancé's favorite dish of the night and this was my second favorite dish. I liked the cubes of deep fried tofu better than the pork belly which was bit too fatty for my taste. I know pork belly is fatty but the proposition of meat to fat was a little off. The sauce was good though as was the kimchi. 

KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) Sliders ($12) - This dish had 2 gochugang deep fried pieces of chicken and it was pretty spicy but went well with the beer. 

Spicy Squid Fried Rice ($20) - This was a bit of a miss for me; I like spicy food but this was a little too spicy for me to enjoy it. There were pieces of deep fried calamari on top but I thought they were a bit overly battered so the proportion of batter to squid was off. I'd pass on this dish.

Scallion Pancake ($5) - This was the special of the day but we both didn't like it. I expected something more flaky like a roti or a Chinese pancake but this was doughy and almost tasted like a normal savory American pancake with a few scallions sprinkled in the batter. Pass on this.

Overall, interesting menu and concept but some of the things fell flat for me. It's best if you love spicy food and also if you have at least 2-6 people (ideally 4-6 people to be able to share more things)"}
{"text":"I liked this place. Its traditional Korean food with a twist. Yes, fusion. 
We ordered tuna and salmon salad as starter to share and I got the kimchi fried rice as the main course. 
The vinaigrette for the salad was absolutely stunning, perfect balance of soy sauce and vinegar  and some other spices. The fish was also super fresh. 
The main course, fried rice, it was smaller portion than what you get from most places but it was the right portion size for me. This dish was very moist and the poached egg added a extra creamy layer to the tasting palette. It was nicely seasoned with just a tiny bit of spiciness. The prawns in there were obviously top quality as well. 


The only thing I guess they can improve on was more dishes. Wanted to have a seafood soup or the seafood pancake but couldn't find them. If I were to come back next time I don't know that to order."}
{"text":"Foods are good but in very small portions. I find it overpriced, you'll be looking at around $120 for two ppl for a good dinner. 
The dishes are good but i wouldn't say exceptional, i have visited other restaurants at same price level but much better food. Some of the dishes i found that they try too hard to provide a unique taste that it lost the food's original flavor.
The service was good though. 
 Also if you have a weak stomach like me, avoid eating the raw dishes, had stomachache after eating the oysters and rare beef dish."}
{"text":"I went there on Saturday night and had the worst time. We came in a big group of 18 people, our waiter did not pay any attention to us. It took us almost 30 minutes just to get our drinks and the food took another 30-40 mins. When we told the waiter we need separate bills he refused. We spent another 15 mins after we finished trying to figure out how much everyone owes. The waiter was lucky tip had already been included in the bill or else he wouldn't have received anything from my group. I will not go back"}
{"text":"Delicious and creative!! We are a fan of Korean food. When we had early dinner at Anju, we love every dish and the idea & cooking techniques that were brought into each dish. Seaweed wafers were so brilliant idea to give a twist to the basic childhood seaweed snack. Spicy lamb bulgogi with rice sticks made me a person who love rice to fall in love with rice sticks. Spicy squid fried rice made us surprised to see the chef used squid ink with rice. All dishes were delicious and made us enjoy the unique cuisine."}
{"text":"We just wanted more food after dinner, dessert, and cocktails, so we came here to get some snacks to eat at our hotel room. This was probably the best food we had in Calgary! A bit pricey but really worth it for the quality of the food and the innovative ingredients. Keep in mind the dishes are small, so it's not like you'll be overstuffed like at traditional Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"Anju seems to be constantly winning rewards and recognition left and right for their take on modern Korean fusion. I've been pretty skeptical to try it after hearing very mixed reviews from friends and family. But a friend was in from out of town and suggested Anju so off we went to give it a go Monday night. 

It's a cool, hip spot. The vibes are sweet, intimate and moody. Like how it's open late (till 1:00am). Perfect for a late night bite.

You know a place is hipster when they charge for the banchan. $3.00 for kimchi? WOW. They have a daily specials menu; Monday is crabby Mondays. A neighbouring table ordered this and it was an incredibly small portion for $18.00.

- Dubu kimchi ($14.00) - the crispy tofu was delicious; lightly friend but smooth inside. The citrus aioli was a great addition and the pork belly hidden underneath was juicy and crispy.
- Dolsot bibimbap ($20.00) - they bring the gochujang sauce on the side so you can make it  however spicy you want (it's not spicy to begin with). Pretty standard. Sadly, not much crispy rice bits either.
- Spicy lamb bulgogi with rice sticks ($14.00) - the lamb was tasty but something was incredibly salty in this dish. Rice cakes (tteokbokki) were better than I expected and we appreciated the variety of vegetables.
- Pan seared sea bream ($20.00) - I love sea bream so thought we'd give Anju's version a try. Comes with a side of kimchi, wasabi soy, nori and grilled lemon. I guess you're supposed to use the nori to make a small sandwich like bite. Pretty mediocre;not much flavour on the sea bream and a tad dry.

Overall, our dinner was decent but fusion eateries have yet to blow me away. I can't say I'll be running back anytime soon to Anju but at least I can say I've finally tried it."}
{"text":"The restaurant ambiance is nice... but the bartender was just plain Gross. I sat down at the bar yesterday night and I order the ceviche and the Brussels sprouts.  The ceviche was okay (not worth $20 but it's not bad... I asked the bartender for a lime and she grabbed then with her bare hands after touching her hair and nose.... I was SHOCKED. Then she realized what she did and started complimented me on my shoes and outfit.  I was sitting at the bar for about 1 hr and she broke about 8 health codes.   This restaurant has potential but they really need to invest a little bit more on the bartenders as they are the first thing the customer sees. 
I will def not seat at the bar anymore.   If you go here please make sure the bartender hands are clean."}
{"text":"Finally got to visit the new Anju. I had been to their prior location before they closed. 
With this new location I had tried a few times to get in & either had user errors with booking (lol) or didn't hear back. All good. 

Brought a friend in for lunch who had never been and our eyes were way bigger than our tummy's but we still ordered four dishes (smaller plates) to share. It was a lot of food but we did our best to finish it all.

We had dolsot bibimbap, crispy tofu with pork belly, lemongrass brussels sprouts, and spicy salmon tacos. I loved it all but right now I am on a caramelized brussels sprouts kick so they were my favourite of this meal. I need to get back there soon to try some more good eats.

The decor is spacious and lovely. Our waitress helpful and friendly. I recommend Anju to any out of towners looking for a great Korean food experience."}
{"text":"Anju is definitely not like other dining options in the 17th Ave area. A different experience, with items on the menu that you cannot find anywhere else.

It may be a bit pricey, but you owe it to yourself to go try it out, at least once!
Excellent service, professional staff and relaxing environment... great option for a date night !"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to check this place out based on the reviews. Kinda missed the mark for us. 

Of the appetizers we had, the grilled eggplant was very good. 

My wife had the Bibimbap and we had to remind ourselves that this was a Korean \"Fusion\" restaurant so these dishes weren't going to be authentic Korean. Unfortunately it just made us want really good authentic Korean food instead. Also, the wait for this dish was extremely long and it was only after reminding our server that it eventually materialized. 

I had the pickerel. Very small serving and the fish was very over-cooked and was rubbery. Also had several bones and fish scales in the dish. Don't think that was supposed to be included for the $16 price tag?

For those who have never had authentic Korean cuisine, this may provide a good introduction. However, next time we will be heading elsewhere for our kimchi fix. 

3 stars."}
{"text":"Went in to have a couple drinks and some snacks with a friend. Althought it was my first time visiting Anju, I spent quite a bit of time in South Korea in the 1980's and during that time became truly infatuated with the savory, spicy, pungent cuisine of the country. I was looking forward to revisiting some of my favourite flavours from memories I spent in Korea, and what better place to do this than Anju!

We started off with a couple cocktails. I ordered an Old Fashioned, while my partner ordered an original Anju offering called Blueberry Smashed in Buffalo Drink. After placing our drink orders, the name of the drink my partner had ordered lingered in my thoughts as our server walked away. It took me a moment to realize why I was feeling uncomfortable about the name, but once it dawned on me, I realized how unsettling it was that a restaurant was appropriating Native Aboriginal culture to sell alcohol. This is still something I feel quite uncomfortable about.

However, once our cocktails arrived, the Old Fashioned was one of the finest I've had in town, and upon tasting my partners he-who-shall-not-be-named drink, I was quite happy with the balance and complexity of the cocktail. After a few sips of each, my concerns from earlier faded slightly.

Browsing over the menu, I noticed some of my favourite dishes that I used to eat in Korea. We settled on just trying two for the night: the infamous gochujang chicken wings, and the brussel sprouts (we were informed they were to die for). With a couple more drinks in us, a light dinner fare would suffice.

First arrived the brussell sprouts. Perfectly fried with crispy bits of Chinese sausage, crunchy bits of toasted walnuts, and a refreshing lemongrass fish sauce dressing. The dish was empty within moments of hitting our table.

For our second dish, which I had been anticipating since the moment we stepped foot in the restaurant, was the gochojang chicken wings. Fried with a super crispy rice flour coating giving them the perfect texture to hold up to the sweet, spicy, sticky gochujang sauce, these wings have been in my line of sight since I started reading reviews for Anju months ago. The anticipation was mounting, and as they finally arrived on the table, I could not wait to bite in.

As soon as I took my first bite of a drummette coated with the ever addictive gochujang glaze, I realized this was not chicken, but my ALL time favourite dish to eat during my time spent in the far east: cat haunches. The chefs did a fantastic job at trimming them down to be able to cleverly disguise them as chicken wings, but I could still tell. They were absolutely perfectly cooked: succulent, fatty, with a bit of a kick from the gochujang to balance it out. Flawless dish.

It was a fantastic dining experience, aside from cultural appropriation being used to sell alcohol. Everything else, from the welcoming door staff, to the attentive and knowledgeable service staff, to the attendant in the bathroom who handed me a beautiful and luscious hand towel to dry my hands with after washing them in a wash basin, was impeccable.

Not to mention, and HOW could I forget?! They've got the best cat haunches in the entire city, hands down. Closest you will come to finding traditional cat haunches outside of Seoul!"}
{"text":"Went during lunch time on a Friday and was seated right away but the waiter mentioned dinner gets packed. 

Food we loved: KFC sliders, brussel sprouts, truffle yam fries, lamb dumplings, and the ferrero rocher tart. 

Cool space, good food, and a nice waiter! Congrats youre doing it right, Anju."}
{"text":"From Austin, TX
Me and my two close friends were here...a few times. We flew in on Tuesday, ate here for lunch.  Loved it so much that when we got back from banff (3 days later), we ate here again for brunch and then ate here AGAIN for dinner.  Literally had everything off the menu.  

top picks:
1) KFC
2) crispy tofu
3) spicy salmon tacos
4) oxtail
5) caesar for brunch w/ ramen!  
6) chocolate pie w/ nori

yup, we went here 3x in less than a week.  Tim our server was awesome!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty Korean fusion fare.

We came here for lunch and had the salmon tacos, crispy tofu, and the doshirak -- a Korean lunch assortment consisting of a potato-based (?) soup, a fried egg on rice, and your choice of protein (we chose beef).  

We enjoyed all of our dishes, in particular the fact that they all had a mild but detectable spicy heat; we've been disappointed that a lot of Westernized ethnic restaurants err on the side of leaving out the spice.  Having said that, the kimchi that came with several dishes was a bit on the mild side.

The service was pleasant enough. 

Overall this was one of the better places we've been to in Calgary so far -- we'd come back."}
{"text":"Visited on Monday night with reservations for 5:30pm, party of 2. My gf has allergies to nuts, sesame seeds, sesame oil and poppy seeds. Our waitress was informed of this and she was amazing at ensuring my gf would be safe. She checked with the kitchen and gave us a list of things that we could definitely try. They even went so far to tell us that the chicken marinade had sesame oil so that was out for us.

We had a lovely time and started with the KFC sliders in the photo. They bake their own buns and the Sauce has a spicy kick. Yummy! They served it with chips similar to ms vicki's with a seasoning that had hints of rosemary sea salt.

Next up was the oxtail tortellini. My gf could not have this but I inhaled all 4 pieces. The pasta was wonton wrappers that held tender shredded oxtail covered in a sesame oil sauce. 

We also tried crunchy chicken tenders which I was less enthused about. The Brussel sprouts were amazing! Tender pieces of pork fat sautéed with onions/ a must try!  My only criticism about Anju is that they're a bit heavy on the salt for my taste. It was borderline for me on the sprouts and the chips that came with the slider, hence 4/5 stars. Service and food were amazing and ambience was great. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Anju since its first days at its old 10th St SW location, so years and years. I wish I hadn't waited so long. We had dinner there yesterday before the Flames game and first I have to note that service did a fantastic job of getting us out the door with ample time to spare- service was friendly knowledgeable and efficient. I also have to mention that the space is comfortable, very modern but cozy and with an excellent chill soundtrack at a good volume for conversation- I loved every minute as far as ambience goes. The FOOD was excellent! We had several shares and two larger plates. Highlight of the shares was the chicken skewers that came with a sweet gochujang and ground peanuts- succulent. My main was the high point: Kimchi fried rice, it's served in a dolsot hot stone bowl and has the bizarre sounding addition of provolone cheese but man it works. Kimchi, pork belly, a perfect soft egg and the cheese get nice and crusty in the hot stone and it's magnificent. One of the best versions I've ever had of this one and something I'd have trouble not ordering again.

Dinner for two with three small plates, two large ones and one cocktail was $82 before tip- a good price for a memorable meal, and portion sizes are very generous,"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing from the staff to the food !

You instantly feel the good vibe as soon as you step in, I sat at the bar since I was alone. All the staff was amazing and fun to talk with.

Aside of the atmosphere, the food was really outstanding! I first order the Oxtall Tortellini with truffle oil (best of all), the Spicy Salmon Tacos and the Crispy Tofu. They were all good. Keep in mind that it's a tapas style restaurant so you may have to order more than one plate."}
{"text":"I think if I were a wealthy meat eater who didn't like authentic Korean food Anju would appeal to me. I've come here a few times at the behest of friends and have tried getting my own dish as well as sharing (which they recommend) and I've always left feeling unsatisfied. There are very limited vegetarian options (probably only one or two main meal options). I got tofu bibimbap once and it was very bland and super expensive for bibimbap (close to $20) - and there weren't even side dishes! When I've come here to share their small plates, my friends who did eat meat enjoyed the food but it was such a small amount for what you're paying that you feel kinda ripped off. I'm not sure they should advertise that it's meant to be shared. I mean if you only get like 3 tortellinis or 4 mushrooms in a small dish is eating 2/3 of one piece of food really that fulfilling? Sorry but I'm not cultured or fancy enough to understand Anju's whole fusion concept. I'm just a cheap fatty who doesn't want to pay twice as much as I would pay for filling and tasty real Korean food that isn't that far away. I don't recommend visiting unless you're really into fusion."}
{"text":"I would come here just for these three things : lemongrass Brussels sprouts , jap chae ( sweet potato noodles with stir fried veggies ) and char grilled king oyster mushrooms. I would pass on hot stone rice bowls which I found really bland. That being said there are other authentic little Korean gems in this city that just aren't as swanky so it depends what you're looking for. This is a fun spot to hit if you're with a group sharing plates and hitting 17th ave after to get it done ;)"}
{"text":"Great boutique Korean food. Some of the comfort foods were lacking. Also, my wife is egg intolerant and it limited the menu choices quite a bit. Still, the food was tasty and served promptly and with a smile. I would recommend this restaurant with no reservations."}
{"text":"I'm generally Not a fan of traditional korean food. That said, I found Anju written up in an Eater blog, checked out the menu, and was sold. The fusion is really smart. And executed well. They've somehow rearranged the flavors, textures, and appearances to come up with something Great. Capital G. 

And those fusion-y, off-tradition dishes are the ones that push the boundaries and make this place worth a visit. Like the oxtail tortellini (actually more like tortelli / tortelloni where the \"pasta\" is made from dumplings). And the Ferrero Rocher tart for dessert (fusing chocolate, red bean, ginger, hazelnut, and gochujang... WTF?). I'm now kicking myself for not ordering the KFC sliders and chicken wings. 

The hot stone rice bowl is decent, but you've seen this elsewhere. Same with the black cod and short ribs. Good flavors, but nothing truly unique or fusion-y. Well executed though.

The day-of-the-week specials are worth a glance (Friday: A full spread of salmon sashimi for $10!) 

Fun, lively atmosphere. We sat indoors, though the outdoor patio looked somewhat inviting. (Except due to the current construction on 17th Ave, you're basically looking at a wall of construction barricades/tarps.)"}
{"text":"I was in Calgary last week and we decided to come  here for brunch/lunch. 

My friends went for their brunch menu but I decided to go for their regular menu and had the kimchi ramen. Ramen was only OK, the noodles didn't feel quite right in terms of taste and texture. Texture was a bit rubbery. The broth was OK, again, nothing spectacular. I did enjoy the dab of crème fraiche, it's not something I've had in ramen before.

Service was incredibly slow. Our server was very apologetic and explained that they had only scheduled him for the entire restaurant that day, which was surprising for a Sunday."}
{"text":"Anju started in a little old house and since it's moved into a big space on 17th it's just gotten even better than ever.
They have some classic dishes like the oxtail dumplings and KFC.
It's refined Korean food that appeals to everyone and satisfies any cravings you might have for something awesome and a little off the usual track."}
{"text":"Anju - which translates to \"food you drink with alcohol\" - just re-opened its doors in a new location on 17th ave. Modern and trendy decor - all clean lines and and a a cool upscale vibe; fast, amazing service (our waitress Colleen was a delight)...and the food, oh the food! I wanted to go back the next day to try out more of the menu, which is an insanely creative take on Korean flavours and ingredients. Expensive and packed, definitely make a reservation.

What we tried (and all were superb):

- Tender oxtail tortellini with soy, truffle and grana padano
- Spicy, garlic-y baked west coast oysters
- Lemongrass brussel sprouts, featuring walnuts and lime. The fried petals were insanely delicious. I love me some roasted brussel sprouts, but I never thought I'd find myself waxing poetic about them. These were unreal. 
- Rice pudding for dessert with red bean paste. Might sound boring, but the flavours and textures were so delicate and the walnut praline was a great touch. 

Drinks: delicious cocktails. i had the cocktail #1 - beefeater, makkoli, thai basic, strawberry chili and lemon. 

The conclusion - I can't wait til I go back to Calgary so that I can eat literally everything on the menu."}
{"text":"This was one of the first time's in a LOOOOONNNGG time that I had ventured out for Valentine's day.  But I was in good company so I was pretty excited to try out this new restaurant that everyone has been talking about.

Firstly, online reservations are amazing!  I love the fact that I can just book online and receive notifications/reminders of my reservation.  Kudos to that, Anju!

Our reservation was at 6PM and our table was prepared and ready.  The coat check was nicely appreciated!  The restaurant has a nice feel and the decor is comfy.  Loved the menus on the wooden planks. But funny enough, the table next to us set their menu on fire accidentally via the candle on the table.  Was quite funny!

The beverage list was hearty and I chose to try the Seoul Sunset (or Sunrise :() and another at our table ordered a beer.  The restaurant serves Q Water and charges $1 for unlimited still or sparkling.  I like the system and glad when restaurants have it.  Some may disagree.  To each their own I guess.

The menu selection was quite substantial!  Bear in mind folks, it's a tapas restaurant.  So be prepared to share dishes and that some dishes aren't full sized portions.  I was with 3 other friends so the portions were nice enough for us.

At first we were going to the chef's tasting menu and decided to ask our server, Ty, what was on it.  Glad he was able to explain the dishes and thus we decided to just select items from the menu.  

Back to Ty - he was awesome!  Very personable, friendly, attentive (but not over-bearing) and made our experience great.  It's too bad that it was his last day that evening :( 

We each decided on 2 items from the menu and ordered in rounds.  Our first round was:  Oxtail tortellini, Wagyu beef tartar, Mushrooms on Toast, and the Sunworks Chicken Wings.  AMAZING!!  My definite fav was the mushrooms on toast.  Something about a perfectly soft poached egg always gets me!  The beef tartar was probably one of the best we've ever had!

Next round was:  Salmon Poke Handrolls, Pork and Shrimp dumplings, Army Stew and Dungeness Crab & Kimchi salad.  These were OK.  Probably the only reason I rated a 4 vs a 5.  Was a bit disappointed with the stew and the crab salad.  Just wasn't really what we expected.  But still ok items.

We wanted a little bit more and then ordered the crispy tofu and pork belly and the sesame ginger chicken.  The crispy tofu was awesome!  Great flavours and cooked to perfection!

Overall and awesome experience.  We will be back to try more and can't wait to experience Anju again!"}
{"text":"Korean lesson: Anju means \"food you eat with alcohol\" which is an awesome name for a restaurant that serves amazing food and delicious drinks.

I worked with a woman named Anju many years ago and now think she is cooler because of her cool name. Except she is not Korean, so maybe it means something else in her country. 

Errrr....in any case...you need to go here. I've only been once and I can't stop thinking about it. I feel like I have some sort of inappropriate crush that can only be satisfied by eating everything on the menu.

We were there for lunch and had the following: 
-Tofu with pork belly - normally I would never order tofu because it's just not my jam, but maybe that's because most tofu is not paired up with pork belly to create these little heavenly nuggets of flavor.
- Lettuce wraps - probably my favorite thing because they come with this sauce that has to be laced with cocaine or something. Seriously, I probably need an intervention because I keep talking about this sauce.
- Sashimi salad - An awesome salad that's healthy. No pork belly in this bad boy.
- Gochujang chicken wings - These were sooo good. Spicy and just really well prepared. I'm pretty sure I had the sauce all over my face so these might not be the best \"date food\" (unless your date is into that kind of thing).
- Salmon tacos - I like to think of these as little envelopes of joy. Highly recommend.

I pretty much loved the entire menu and cannot wait to go back. Service was attentive and professional - a rarity in this town.

Bottom line - If you have an addictive personality you're going to suffer from withdrawal (as I have) or need an intervention. Best to go with friends so that you can try as many dishes as possible."}

Located just up the street from Model Milk, an area passed through frequently both for dining and en route to downtown Calgary, Chef Roy Oh's Anju played host to a Sunday dinner that will go down as one of the most memorable in Western Canada, the modern Korean concept based on \"food consumed with Alcohol\" requiring none of the latter to be as delicious as it was intriguing.

Open now for dinner and late-nights seven days a week, Brunch on weekends also a popular event, Anju was originally placed on my agenda thanks to a story about Chef Oh's roundabout path to a career in the kitchen, a non-traditional route that includes no formal culinary education, but rather the influence of his Mother plus a whole lot of tenacity and good fortune.

Furthering my interest reading the accolades achieved since opening, a perennial slot on several \"Best of\" lists suggesting that the combination of boldly flavored cuisine and an upscale space has continued to evolve and impress over time, it was just after 6:45 that I was sat between two groups of four, their orders at first giving me pause considering the portion sizes, the server also offering warning that \"two-to-four\" plates per person was reasonable, though a total of nine including Dessert proved well-worth testing my stomach's resolve.

Well designed with mixed-woods, white walls, upward shining lights and an open kitchen, those born prior to 1996 also likely to appreciate a soundtrack featuring the likes of TLC and Blackstreet playing overhead, it was in five well-paced courses that the evening progressed over the course of approximately 130 minutes, an opening plate of mixed Mushrooms lightly battered and exceedingly flavorful even before dipping in Ponzu, a rare occasion where Truffle Oil was well-utilized to accentuate the flavor rather than masquerade as something justifying a substantial price-hike.

More than a little well-known for their Korean Fried Chicken, available as a large sharable plate but far more accessible for solo diners as Wings, Anju's product from Maple Hill Farms covers all the bases for what a great Bird should be by coming across plump with a thick and crispy coating lacquered in Sauce, a total of four available with the housemade smoked Sablefish Kabayaki and Sesame outperforming David Chang's Octo-Vinaigrette as relates to both sticky-thickness and umami.

Impressed to this point, but happy to have expectations exceeded, Anju's \"Foie Gras & Tofu\" arrived next to achieve the rare feat of redefining a luxury ingredient, the Mousse thick yet light with Plums draped over and ready to be smeared on seared Steam Buns with a bit of smoke and salinity added by shaved Marrow and Soy.

Pressing onward to two completely different types of 'Noodles,' the springy nuggets of glutinous Rice an adept backdrop for tender Short Rib and Cabbage while the Potstickers came connected by a delicate lattice with a lot of funk and medium heat, it was actually Anju's seasonal Kobacha Squash that made quite an impact by way of Soy-infused-Butter, Cashews and bright top-notes of Citrus and Ginger.

Taking a strong Double Espresso to refresh the palate and invigorate, all three desserts proving as irresistible as reviews suggest, one would be hard-pressed to decide which to omit if forced to do so, the Sweet Potato Trifle without a doubt the lightest and sweetest thanks to Cereal Milk Ice Cream and an airy Sponge Cake while the Fuyu Persimmon Cheesecake ate like one made with Ricotta amidst well-balanced Citrus and minty notes, the \"Dark Chocolate White Truffle Pate\" another undeniable umami-bomb that may not suit everyone's palate, but proved defiantly delectable with the acidity playing off sweetness and a lingering bit of heat from the Red Chili paste."}
{"text":"There isn't much to dislike about Anju. The food and service are both great. I've taken a date here on several occasions and I have zero complaints. Some of the things that we ordered were: KFC Sliders, Beef Striploin Tataki, Poke Bowl, Oxtail Tortellini, Maple Hill Chicken Wings, Spicy Squid Fried Rice, Grilled Beef Short Ribs, and Crispy Tofu. All the dishes were top notch but the Oxtail Tortellini and Spicy Squid Fried Rice were in a league of their own.....great now I'm hungry haha. The cocktails are also very good but the Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels has made me go back on a few occasions. The service has always been very attentive and helpful. If you haven't been here it should be on your go-to list.
*Visited July/17"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, cool environment! The food is amazing and mouth watering. My favorites were the sweet potato truffle fries, brussel sprouts (if you hate brussel sprouts, this dish will make you love them) and the Japchae!"}
{"text":"Quick review.....sat at the bar on a Sunday night. Bartenders were great with prompt service and helpful advice navigating the menu. I can't recall everything we ordered, but the crunchy, chili dumplings and the amazing crispy tofu were rock star! Korean tapas is a great idea and you do it to perfection. I will be back the next time I'm in YYC."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with Anju to be honest. I tried extremely hard to like it, since I love traditional and modern Korean cuisine and culture, but to no avail.

We reserved my birthday dinner around the first stampede weekend, so the restaurant was pretty busy. The servers and hosts greeted us and seated us quickly. 

Our server explained the menu and specials to us, and was very personable. Our drinks were okay, nothing special. We ordered one of their specials as an appetizer - rappokki. Rapokki is technically Ddokpokki with ramen, but they added some pork to it as well. It was extremely spicy! Okay, ddokpokki is usually pretty spicy to begin with, and I love spicy. In fact, I boil a ton jalapeños in my kimchijigae and on other korean soups I make at home. But seriously, their rapokki was way too spicy, almost inedible.

Our mains were both dolsot bibimbap.  I got the beef and my fiance got the chicken. Both bibimbap lacked any sort of flavour and the aroma was just that of grilled meat. I love meat, don't get me wrong, but bibimbap is typically a vegetarian dish, that you can add some meat or tofu into. Usually, bibimbap would overwhelm you with the smell of fresh veggies, sesame oil, and picked veggies. Then you would add some gochujang paste that has been made specifically for bibimbap(usually with some sesame oil and sugar). But their bibimbap was just bland and their gochujang sauce was just spicy. Just nothing special, and for the price you pay ($20+ for dolsot bibimbap) it should be amazing.

Also, their side dishes(you will need to order 3 for $9) were just bland. They gave us normal cabbage kimchi (which did not taste all too fresh), kimchied cucumbers, and Daikin kimchi. Way too redundant and pricey for $9.

Overall, it was okay. Again, nothing special. We might come back, we might not, it's just not on the top our list of restaurants to visit again."}
{"text":"Went the other evening after many failed attempts! We finally made it, our server was friendly and very knowledgeable when we asked for suggestions. We had the fried tofu with kimchi which was outstanding!!! Also had the Brussel sprouts, also ridiculously sweet and charred and yummy....only one piece of pork belly but it was ok because the tofu had loads. We also ordered the tortellini which was tasty but didn't blow us away. These were just appetizers and we were too full for entrees but plan on going back soon to dig further into the menu."}
{"text":"Day 1: 3/5. Day 2: 3.5/5
Day 1: OK... now I've been here once before and enjoyed it, but this round was pretty disappointing. They have a new lunch menu and, for the first two weeks of it, had a special 50% of the lunch menu on weekdays. Tomorrow is the last day and I will give it one more go since I did enjoy it last time.... but I will be ordering different items.

The atmosphere at anju is nice and the service was good. I liked that they explain how things come out family style so we didn't expect to get all our food at the same time. I wouldn't expect this at most korean places but since it's a modern fusion restaurant, you just never know. My friend and I shared some dishes while the others ordered their own plates.  

We got the crispy tofu with kimchi and pork belly. 5/5 for tender pork belly, tasty kimchi and indeed crispy tofu! The flavours went well and the kimchi was great!

The black bean noodles get a 3/5. The redeeming factor here is that they did not skimp on the ingredients. There were plenty of veggies and tonnes of shrimp! Unfortunately, this dish was bland and really needed more spices. Also, it was sticky and dry compared to the saucy black bean noodles I know. Gochujang saved the dish... but as a coworker said, if that's what it takes, it's not very good.

Lastly, the Poke.... not sure if they're just trying to hop on the poke bandwagon but this dish was pretty bad as far as I'm concerned. I give this a 2.5/5 and even that only because the fish seemed decently fresh and the avocado nicely ripe. They ran out of bowls which made it difficult to eat the way it should be eaten. The fish was barely marinated. The other ingredients were  just plain and shredded. The marinade itself lacked flavour... maybe it was soy sauce and sesame oil... no green onions, ginger, garlic, or sweetness that I could taste or see. I've made poke at home and it tasted a million times better than this!

I'm convinced we just ordered the wrong things since the stone bowl bibimbap with beef and the steak sandwich looked, and apparently tasted,  great! If things go better tomorrow, I will leave another review!

Now to be fair... my bill came to $14 and I left $20 since the service was good and I like to tip on the full price. It was very very cheap for anju. But honestly I wouldn't even pay that much for the noodle and poke dishes again.

Day 2: As promised, my next review. An improvement on yesterday and fine for the discounted price we paid... but not fabulous. 

Curry chicken  pitas get a 4/5 with a lovely creamy  curry flavour that isn't too overwhelming,  the ripe tomato and micro greens add some needed freshness, and there was plenty of chicken! There were a few too many onions in it for me, but I'm biased as I'm not a huge fan of raw onions in general... a few hours later though the onion is still lingering in my mouth.

3.5/5 beef bibimbap had nice medium cooked steak bites in it were good quality and tender and the veggies were nicely cooked, but the veggies needed a touch of seasoning and the rice itself was cooked with too much water leading to the dreaded rice mush. It was so mushy it wouldn't even sear on the stone bowl even though we left it for a solid 7 minutes. The gochujang sauce was good but could have used a bit more flavour vs spice.

3.5/5 BC halibut had a nice salty crust but it was a bit overcooked. It was served with one half of a nice bittersweetly charred bok choy..... however, if these plates are meant to be shared, shouldn't there be at least 2 halves?? Rice was nicely seasoned but there was too much of it without anything to cut through the sesame oil... 

Ramen caesar gets a 3/5. The seasoning they use tastes like the instant ramyun spice packets.... and I confirmed that that is indeed what they use lol! Interesting but I much prefer a regular caesar myself. 

My final opinion: Fine for what we paid (50% off food) but I wouldn't pay full price for these dishes except for the curry chicken pitas and crispy tofu with pork belly. Service was great, atmosphere is good. Location is central but parking kinda sucks."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The interior is like a jewel box with their rich colors and beautiful lights. And the food was excellent. The best beep bim bop I have every had. So good."}
{"text":"It's good.  We ordered the brussel sprouts, oxtail dumplings, bibimbap and the fish tacos.  And the green tea coconut butter tart.  

As with most fusion restaurants, it is their own take on traditional dishes with a modern twist.  It's fun if you are into something a bit different, but I was just disappointed with the bibimbap.  

The brussel sprouts were interesting, sweet and crunchy, they were ok, but nothing to ride home about.  The oxtail dumplings were also tasty, but nothing extremely spectacular; a bit lukewarm in temperature.  

The bibimbap in the stone bowl was not hot enough at all.  The stone bowl was not hot enough to create the crunchy rice in contact with the bowl.  And the rice itself was just lukewarm.  Very disappointed in this.  If the temperature was hot enough, this would have been a knockout dish, as the beef was cooked to perfection, and there were plenty of fresh toppings in the bowl.  

The fish tacos were fun to eat, we appreciated the de-boned fish.  This was innovative and tasted good.

Dessert was the best part of the meal, the butter tart is to die for.  I wish I could eat some right now.

As with the bibimbap, the service is also lukewarm."}
{"text":"My wife and I have dined a number of times at Anju and have never been disappointed (it's our go-to place)!  I think we've tried most of the menu over the years (it's evolved over time) but our collective favourites are the wings (Korean fried chicken!), the tofu with kimchi (so good!), and the lettuce wraps (my wife prefers the pork belly as the protein).  I love their cocktail concoctions as well - unique but refreshing - and the ambiance is great.  Roy runs the kitchen with zeal with some delicious new fusion Korean dishes... Our favourites have been the clay pot black cod and the brussel sprouts with Chinese sausage.  The only challenge is that everyone else loves Anju so sometimes it can be busy.  Can't wait to eat the wings again!"}
{"text":"Very good! my son brought me here with his GF and her mother, good trendy place in Downtown for Korean BBQ, and kimchi.
I had the kinky quinoa and it was really good, tapas style apps are great to share and try a little bit of everything. Not cheap for what it is but worth it."}
{"text":"This is my 4th time here at Anju. I think I've had almost everything on the menu! My favorite are the oxtail dumplings, crispy tofu and the fish tacos. Pretty well everything is good. Tonight we tried the pork shoulder. It has to be ordered 24 hours in advance. There was 9 of us and it fed us easily."}
{"text":"Wow this place is a gem!  Came here on a Friday evening w/o a reservation, not a good idea.  Just as we were politely told we could not be seated, as luck would have it two seats at the bar opened up - my preference anyways.  Bartender, believe name was Matt, was awesome.  Quick to recommend his favorite plates and makes a damn fine cocktail (Banana Clip was incredible!).

Food came out very fast and was ridiculously good.  Got the salmon tacos (good portion for the price, fresh fish), brussel sprouts (great spice and flavor, ample bacon included), bone marrow (huge portion, loved the soft toast on the side), the oxtail tortellini (very tasty and they snuck in an impressive amount of meat for the size), the spicy fish stew (great dish, wasn't crazy about the clams but the squid, mussels, sauce was unforgettable)....cannot remember the last dish we got but it was great, ranking my favorite was like picking a favorite child."}
{"text":"I've been here about 3 times for their Korean style tapas and every time is delicious! Food is definitely unique and flavourful. I love their take on Korean fusion - definitely modern, but you can easily recognize the Korean influences. 

My favourite dish is their marinated beef tartare. There are also a few other dishes that escape me right now. I've never really had a dish that I thought was bad. 

The only issue I have with Anju is the pricing and the portion size. Things are very pricey given the size of the plate, and not really what I'd consider tapas. I felt that the portion sizes are not shareable, even amongst only two people. For a group of 4, we often had to order 2 to 3 of the same dish to make sure everyone was able to try some. 

Service is always great and friendly. Drinks were also very good too. They also have some Korean alcohol, which is always fun to try (soju!). Overall good experience, but pricey!"}
{"text":"Anju needs to come to Los Angeles! Blown away by the creativity of the menu. An excellent fusion of Korean-Canadian-Latin American tapas. Anju takes the classic, Korean comfort cuisine to new levels of amazement. We loved the crispy tofu, the squid ink bibimbap, and the spicy fried chicken. The sharing system was perfect. We only wish we could return!"}
{"text":"Ooooh soooo yummy!

Went with a large group so we pre ordered the family style group meal.  This included KFC or Korean fried chicken.  I seriously still dream of the deliciousness that is this chicken!!! And the pork that they slow roasted all day just for us...well you just have to try it!  
   I left happy and I'm here so full.  Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely magnificent!

In a city where good service seems hard to find, there is a gem amongst them. This was a busy restaurant and I can see why.

We were very quick to get a table.  We were seated in a booth, very comfortable.  I caught a glimpse of their dining chairs and if I were stuck in one of those, I may be singing a different tune.  

The food was just phenomenal.  The oxtail was great. Really has a mild flavor, but savory none the least.  You can tell the freshness of the noodle, DELICIOUS!

Brussel sprouts
 Mussel and clam soup
Both were very good.

The highlight of the meal was definitely the

{"text":"It was very interesting to try the everything. We had dinner here after my friend recommended it. We had five different things we shared and a dessert. The White Tiger Roll and the mushroom tempura were my favorite. I was not a fan of the Seafood Curry Ramen Nest as it was so salty, we both could have drank a liter of water to ourselves after .We got the Walnut Cheddar Stuffed Pancake for \"Dessert\" and I feel like it was much more savory then sweet as I walked away not really feeling like I ate a dessert per say."}
