{"text":"Small restaurant with family atmosphere. Food was great. The bread was fresh and warm - to die for! The Arrabiata sauce was awesome."}
{"text":"I went to Adela's thinking it would be a regular Italian restaurant, but I was pleasantly surprised by an excellent dish. I could tell that the bread they brought out in the beginning was made right when we were seated. And I forgot what dish I had is called, but it is so well made that it is simple yet very rich. It definitely has clean, home-made taste, but not boring at all. And my stomach felt so clean, satisfied, and comfortable after eating here. This is the best Italian place I've been to in Phoenix. I couldn't help but kept wanting to go back to try other dishes, so I ended up having a rehearsal dinner here for my wedding as well. The staff was so helpful and served all of us in a great manner. It is a very great place. I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMEND! The best Italian food I've ever had, topped off with phenomenal service! I made a yelp account just to give them the hype they deserve"}
{"text":"Honestly, the best Italian food I've had since I moved away from Boston. And the chef and owners are wonderful people."}
{"text":"Working in Phoenix and found a hidden gem. If you like true Italian food this is the place. The portions are perfect not too much but a nice portion you would make yourself at home. You have to ask for the meatballs Which I found out after I ordered the Veal But I will be back for those. The veal was great. Cooked perfectly in a lemon wine sauce with mushrooms and artichokes. Yumm is all can say . Family owned with lots of local traffic love it! I will be back during my next trip for those meatballs."}
{"text":"What a find! I'm so glad I got out of downtown for dinner and found this gem. Friendly staff, and wonderfully delicious food! I ordered the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo which was fabulously creamy without being clumpy and thick. For dessert as of course a cannoli. A fresh, smooth cream filled, chocolate chip covered cannoli. Perfect! I'm rather picky about my cannolis too. I highly recommend a visit to Adela's."}
{"text":"Excellent local Italian.  Get the Eggplant  Parmesan!  Great service."}
{"text":"Decent service, great food.  I used an Entertainment coupon and was pleased with everything.  The lasagna was not your typical lasagna but good none the less."}
{"text":"We decided to try Adela's based on reviews and proximity from out hotel.  We started with Venice Margarita which was surprisingly excellent.  We ordered Caprese salad, Pollo Boscaiola and Veal Carciofini.  The food was really good and the service was fantastic.  We loved the wine we ordered that we ended up buying a bottle to take back home.  The restaurant is very cute and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Hoping to find a Chicago-style Italian restaurant, we tried Adela's Italian for my sister's birthday dinner on a Saturday night. The food was okay, but not great. My sister ordered the lasagna and we searched and searched, but didn't find the usual ricotta cheese among the layers--she was disappointed. I had the orrecchiette with sausage, and I wasn't impressed with the first few bites, but I eventually thought it was good. My husband had the spaghetti, with meatballs and sausage which he really like, and my brother had the fettuccine alfredo and he too was happy with his selection. I found the decor amusing...it reminded me of glitzy 80s meets Goodfellas, but not in a good way. The owner did come around to chat with all of the patrons, and that was nice, but it isn't enough to make us want to return. We will keep searching..."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Love the family vibe and the quality of the food is top notch. Must visit, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The fettuccine alfredo with chicken was incredible. The chicken was seasoned perfectly, but ever so slighty overcooked. Noodles were adequate, but the sauce was heavenly.  The staff was gracious and attentive. Wine selection was divided not only by white or red, but light to heavy/dark. If you're not familiar with different types of wine, this tends to simplify things. Overall, it was worth the drive and adequately priced. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I love Italian food! And of course I had to try this place. It is delicious, love everything from the beginning, the bread, the coffee, the food, the service. I love it, it made me want to try the dessert, and I couldn't be happier, totally will come back."}
{"text":"Food is great! Nice variety to the menu and food came out in a timely manner. ( I ordered a lot of food.) Definitely check it out if you are a fan of Italian food. Overall"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Authentic Italian food family owned and operated! The chef is the dad and came out to each table talked to everyone and made sure everything was perfect! No wonder for all the other great reviews! We had an amazing server Jamie who again was so nice!!!   Now on to the food! I had a pull apart veal pasta dish which was the special and amazing! My girlfriend had the fettuccine alfredo which I am not normally a fan of but loved it here!!!!!   RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"In town for a few days, found this place after stopping at Avanti's up the road which was closed. Very glad the other restaurant was closed.  Food was great and the staff was great. I had the handmade pappardelle pasta with alfredo and shrimp. Spouse had the Chicken Parm with the same pappardelle. Awesome... would be back if we didn't live in Seattle."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely spectacular dinner here. Come from an Italian family and always have a difficult time finding good authentic cuisine. This place, however, has an elegant variety of dishes to chlose from that are prepared on the spot, and all made in house from scratch. Ps. The cannolis are outstanding"}
{"text":"The best in AZ .. The food is fresh the customer service is excellent.. They make you feel like family. That's why I love  places like this"}
{"text":"Really good Italian food with excellent service! Everything tasted like it was made fresh. We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time at Adela's but I will definitely be coming back. Delicious Italian dishes all from homemade recipes. Good portion sizes and good price points. The homemade bread is a must. They have good selection of Italian wines. We were so full that we didn't have room for the desserts ~ but next time. The staff is friendly and helpful with menu selections.  Sorry forgot to take photo of our dishes."}
{"text":"Ooops, reviewed the wrong place. I'm sure adela's is just fine."}
{"text":"Great housemade pappardelle pasta and his sauces are ready to jar and sell. Amazing food for such a subtle place. I ordered the special the night I was there and it was a slightly spicy luscious red sauce. It appears orangey from the fresh tomatoes that consume such bite. Whatever is on the menu- I suggest substituting the house made pappardelle. It's fresh thick and buttery. Worth adding to any dish."}
{"text":"Delicioso!!  The Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo along with the Cannoli was Great!!!  Salad and Bread with butter were hot out of the oven and precut for enjoyment!  Wine and service was on point!  I will be back again and HIGHLY RECOMMEND this nice restaurant for a relaxing and cozy dinner."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious. The house salad had a great dressing. Our dishes at the table where the pollo picata, gnocchi alla vodka and a special. All were great with delicious sauces and even food so you are not still hungry but get you moneys worth. Service was good and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"So pleasantly surprised by this amazing little spot! Saw the positive reviews on Yelp a while back and the restaurant is close to a weekly evening appointment so decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed. The service was wonderful even though we chose to sit on the patio. Every employee we walked passed smiled and said \"Hi\" and our server was friendly, helpful and patiently answered all of our menu questions. The atmosphere was quaint and cozy. The food is a whole other story. The humble surroundings do not prepare you for the phenomenal quality of food you will get at Adela's. I adore Italian food -legit Italian food and this place is the real deal. I literally cleaned my plate - I NEVER clean my plate. To top it off, the chef came out from the kitchen to ensure that we were enjoying our meals. Class act. Great food. Go now."}
{"text":"This is a great little homestyle restaurant! The food is delicious AND the chef made me Shrimp Parmigiano even though it's not on the menu. The bread is warm with a hint of garlic...I'd be happy just eating the bread. The staff is friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Great food you can tell its made fresh. This is my new favorite restaurant food is better tasting than other italian restaurants including Maggianos. To top it off the customer service is great!! A must do if your in the area!"}
{"text":"Very indiscreet place stuck in the corner of a strip mall. But don't be fooled by the spartan furnishings. The food is excellent and very reasonable. Had the veal parmigiana and it was as good as I have ever had and the beef ravioli was excellent, too."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly staff! I rely on yelp when I travel. I highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I visited Adela's last night with my family after reading the great reviews on Yelp.  Everything we read was more than accurate. The food was absolutely delicious! My daughter had the manicotti which was to die for. I had the eggplant sorrentno which was fantastic.  The owner and his wife conversed with us throughout the evening and they were lovely.  It's family restaurants like these that you want to give your business."}
{"text":"Fresh food; love the Gnocchi! Friendly folks, a comfortable neighborhood bistro. Food goes well with their nice chianti."}
{"text":"Hi. Ate Adelas Italian food for first time. I decided to order and take it home. I was craving spaghetti and Italian Sausage.  Spaghetti was great and they gave me a lot. I could only eat half. But it is all in my refrigerator for later. I liked the garlic bread too and the sausage was good too. All the food was real good and at a reasonable price. I liked the packaging too. They used aluminum foil along with normal styrofoam packaging. Food stayed hot till I got home. The staff is very friendly and very meticulous. I will definitely try other things from Adels italian. Next going to get lasagna. I like this place. Thanks. Bill"}
{"text":"Adela's was one of the best Italian foods I've had!  Service was fast and friendly. Place is clean and open they have outside seating which was very clean also.  Chicken Alfredo was delicious! I would definitely recommend and come back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend & I were delighted to come across Adela's last night. Being well versed in what the valley has to offer currently, Adela's is hands down the finest Italian cuisine in Phoenix. When a restuarant truly has an amazing product & excellent service, they don't have to rely upon trendy marketing and pretentious awards which may not even accurately represent quality. This will be for sure our \"go to\" date night restaurant and we will be sure to spread the word about Adela's to friends & family."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The food is delicious but the service! Wow. It is amazing. It's such a joy to come to a restaurant with my family and be treated almost like guests into their home. We will definitely be back more often!"}
{"text":"We decided to have dinner because of the positive reviews. Not being from this area we decided to give it a try. The service was prompt and courteous. We ordered the Pollo Picasa and Pollo Parmigiano, the food was served hot and delicious. Thumbs up to this family owned and operated restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Its in a corner strip mall and didnt have many customers so decided to check the ratings. They were so good we decided to try it. The customer service was fantastic and the food was even better. Very affordable for the flavors they provide, defiantly left me craving to come back and try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise on a whim, to find a nice Italian meal near our hotel. The veal was excellent and the red wine was OK too. It was my birthday and I received a FREE dessert (Tiramisu) another excellent choice. The cannoli was a different story, not sweet enough. Server was very nice and helpful in recommending items on the menu. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Friendly!  Excellent food, especially the vegetables; tasty, fresh and done al dente with vibrant colors."}
{"text":"I can't eat cheese so at any Italian place I am limited - but I go for the Chicken Piccata and it is addictive.  This hard to spot Italian Restaurant is definitely worth the trip.  They also have one large wood table that seats I think 8 and they do reserve tables.  I have never been there when it is busy so I don't know if they ever have a wait but if not I don't know why not because they have really good food."}
{"text":"The food was delicious!!! The lobster ravioli was rich in flavor and the garlic bread was both soft and crunchy!!! The owners were super friendly, inviting, and warm. I usually try places twice to make sure it is consistent but for now five stars from me!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend Loves the Chicken Piccata! I love the daily specials! So good. Great chef, great wine, great food, great people! We always have a great time too!"}
{"text":"Food was great ! Staff was great !   We had the Lasagna and Chicken Picatta, both were amazing. The bread was off the charts as well. We will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone who loves great food !"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Family run fantastic service and the food is amazing. My Italian family loved it so much we were here twice in four days. The gnocchi was great melt in your mouth, light as air. We had many different plates all very good. And the service/atmosphere was great as well. We will be back, wish you were in Colorado."}
{"text":"If I could give more stars I would.  Seafood was cooked to perfection, price is almost too good to be true.  The staff was wonderful.  So glad I stumbled upon Adela's!  Best Italian food I have had in a very long time."}
{"text":"This is an outstanding family eatery. The meat lasagna was outstanding, the bread is over the top and may I say the cheesecake is \"Orgasmic\". Highly recommend. As far as I could tell almost everything is made on premises. How many places make their own cheesecake......"}
{"text":"As good as it gets plain and simple. Wonderful service and staff, quick and friendly. I will be back maybe even once a week"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  It's a smallish place, not super fancy, but the food is great and reasonable price. The chef came out to the table to verify my lactose intolerant daughters order, then actually brought it out to her to make sure everything was ok."}
{"text":"My new favorite Italian restaurant in Arcadia. Our old fav, La Fontanella's closed a year ago:( We met friends for a casual dinner. I was blown away by the marinara sauce and spaghetti. Our friends had the ravioli and the veal and both were ecstatic. Service was great. Food quality was excellent and pricing is fair. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I've never been to this place until last night. We started out with the calamari which we promptly finished. I would have been happy eating that all night. They also bring you house made bread which is phenomenal. I ordered the beef lasagna which was top notch. The portions are adequate you can eat and not feel shame once you leave. The wait staff was very helpful and everyone was very friendly I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend found this place via Yelp, so it's only appropriate that I share my review to help others.  This was where I had my birthday dinner with my immediate family.  We were welcomed into this (quite small) spot hidden in a two-story strip mall.  It was packed, despite being in the middle of the week, so clearly we were in good company in knowing of Adela's!  Each of us ordered something different, though we started out with the stuff mushrooms that luckily I, being the birthday girl, got to have an extra -- so yummy and so decadent (we're talking about butter sauce, ya know!).  My entree was pollo al limone which was super yummy, my bf had the simple aglio e olio, which he devoured, and my parents also enjoyed their entrees thoroughly.  Being my birthday, we were also treated to a dessert - I believe I selected the tiramisu which we liked as well.  Our server was attentive  and provided a great wine recommendation based upon the picky people at the table's tastes (that'd be me and my mom), and also ensured it would complement our meals.  All in all, a fantastic meal thanks to the charming staff and cooks at Adela's!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed I love the arribiata with sausage, can't get enough of the spicy tomato sauce.... And they deliver to! But I can't resist not going to the restaurant and talking to the owner. Such an amazing chef with true experience."}
{"text":"My Husband and I stopped by here on our way back to California and boy were we impressed how good the food was! I ordered the Pollo Marconi and it was not only a huge plate but was soooooo good! That sauce was soooo tasty and made to perfection! A must order! My husband got the chicken Parm.. and he also loved it!! The service was amazing and we will def. be stopping back there anytime we are in the area! Thank U for giving us a Great Experience! =)"}
{"text":"Este es el mejor restaurante italiana que he probado en mi vida , el sazón es buenísimo como el de mi abuelita . El servicio es excelente y los precios buenos , me hubiera gustado darles 10 estrellas . Se los recomiendo no se van arrepentir."}
{"text":"We came into Adela's last Saturday night for the first time with two of our friends. I was in charge of choosing our dinner spot and was so pleased with Adela's! The food was delicious--we each got different pastas (mine was the shrimp with baby clams in a cream sauce and was to die for) and were all so happy with our meal. I felt the prices were appropriate for the quality and flavor of the dishes. (Also - get the stuffed mushroom appetizer! So tasty!) The service was very quick and friendly, although it wasn't too busy. This is a really cute family owned spot and there is nothing pretentious or haughty about the place, which I'm a big fan of. You could go in and jeans and be just fine! :)  We will certainly visit again! My new go-to Italian spot."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and we keep getting lucky thanks to Yelp and this place is a must to visit. We had two wonderful meals, the service was great and the people taking care of us were both friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I think one of the hardest things to find about an Italian Restaurant is the clean and fresh taste that is used from herbs and spices. Most of what we find from places like Olive Garden is canned food that taste far from the real thing. Many of the Italian food I have eaten at restaurants is something I come out of the restaurant wondering what I actually ate.  However, Adela's Italian food is something you can taste from the very beginning with the calamari and the sauce it came with it. You can actually taste your food and savor the ingredients. Adela's is truly a wonderful place with wonderful service. The servers there were always on point and right there to tend to our needs. It was truly wonderful."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal this evening.  Started with the bread. Could have made that my main course. Really good stuff.  Calamari appetizer done perfectly. Another meal into itself.  Then a great lasagna. Doesn't get much better than this.  I will be back.  F"}
{"text":"Great food. Quickly becoming one of my favorite places because it's solid food and great family owned. Love it."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Pollo al Limone was everything I wanted it to be and more! Kiddo got the half order spaghetti & meatballs and it was everything I could do to keep him from licking the plate clean."}
{"text":"Brought my brother here for his birthday since he wanted Italian and it was a great choice! The service was amazing and you can tell the family takes pride in their food. Really enjoyed it!   Mom had the lobster ravioli which she said was delicious and my brother had penne pasta with beef."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if our chef was different from the one that the other yelpers raved about, but the food was a pure disappointment.  I had the Fettuccine Alfredo and my friend had some sort of shrimp pasta.   1. Both of our pastas were overcooked 2. Both of our pastas were underseasoned (her shrimps tasted great though). My dish was bland and hers was overly sour. We pretty much emptied the salt and pepper bottles to compensate for the poor flavor.   The bread was good, though. A hint of garlic on top of warm, soft bread. It tasted really well with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.   Still, I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious! The food and service was excellent. Everything is made from scratch. The owners are so nice and welcoming. They really make you feel like you're at home. I'm definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"this our first time ever in in Phoenix. my fiancee and I are here for an international training event for the company we work with and were looking for a good Italian restaurant that wasn't far from our hotel. and we by chance stumbled upon Adelas after being at another restaurant with a waiting time of over an hour long.   When we got to Adelas, we were greeted so graciously by Jaime. Right away he made us feel so welcome there. it's like we've known them our whole lives.   3 of us ordered the Chicken pasta dish that is pictured on the menu (sorry forget what it was called). It was delicious. then for dessert we had the cream puffs and tiramisu. was to die for.   Jaime and his father has such great personalities. We DEFINITELY recommend going here if you guys are ever in the area and are looking for great food and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"All I can say is YUMMO!! Happened across this place by chance while in town for business- and so glad I did. I will be back next time I'm in town. It is small but the deliciousness is big! I started off with the fresh bread- hot, fresh, and had just the right amount of garlic. I also had a house salad which was quite large, made with fresh crisp greens and the best homemade dressing I've tasted in a while. For my entrée I ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo- unoriginal, I know, but oh soooo good! I planned to only eat half and save the rest for later but it was so tasty I couldn't stop stuffing my mouth."}
{"text":"First time tonight at recommendation of some friends. Great food and service. Jaime was terrific. Felt at home right away, appropriate pacing of the meal - did not feel rushed. Atmosphere is \"homey\" in a positive way. Not part of some big corporate restaurant chain with pre-programmed music blaring. Family owned which is always a positive. Yes it is in a strip mall but you forget about that quickly since the service and food is so good. Pasta was hot and complimentary bread was a nice touch. Gnocchi was terrific. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! This restaurant is remarkable. It is small. It is quaint. It is tucked in the corner of a shopping strip. It was nice. The food was great. The baked ziti wasn't heavy, but cooked to perfection. I was pleased with the entire experience!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both times after their lunch rush. It's nice and quiet (at least when I've been there), and the food is pretty good. They have a pretty nice little patio next to a pond that is fenced off. I've had the pollo primavera and their fettuccine toscana. Both dishes were very good with my preference leaning towards the primavera. I'll be back to try the lasagna."}
{"text":"Don't know what has happened to my old version of Adela's but the food was definitely different this time around.  All dishes lacked salt.  The puttanesca dish needed some zip, maybe more garlic... something.  The shrimp in the dish were perfectly cooked though.  The veal parmagiana was a disappointment and was the pasta and sauce that accompanied it.  The pasta del la casa was nicely flavored with bacon but again lacked salt.  The chicken par magiana was ok,  but do people go out to dinner to eat just \"OK\" food?   The service was attentive and I didn't have the heart to tell our server how disappointed we were with the food. BTW, the bread was really good and fresh... that was a plus."}
{"text":"Had a coupon from the Entertainment Book.  Went here with a friend.  Was not crowded so we were able to sit wherever we wanted.  You can sit outside but since it was windy we sat inside.  The place is small but cozy.  I went to restroom to wash hands. ( I feel you can tell alot about a restaurant by the cleanliness of there restrooms.)  The restroom was very clean We were greated by James the owners son.  Very nice young man.  My friend and I wanted salads each ceasar salads he suggested we split one since they are large which we did.  The lettuce was fresh and very crispy, just the right amount of dressing too, not to much not to little.  Salad was excellent.  The bread they bring out was something I had never tasted before, did not taste like french bread nor sourdoe but it was very good and fresh .  James also brought out olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping.   I had the Manicotti.  I cant believe how good it was.  The pasta actually melted in my mouth.  I have never had this good of pasta in my life and I dont think I can eat it anywhere else.  It was not to thick or thin with just the right amount of the cheese stuffed inside and the sauce was not to sweet or too tomatoe. There also was fresh Pharm on table.  Not from a shaker can.   I will go back just for the great pasta.   You can tell this was all homemade My friend had the Chicken artichoke pasta.  She could not stop eating it too.  She said the flavors were excellent.  lots of fresh chicken and she loved the pasta she knew it was fresh.   We did not have dessert we were to full but Im sure there desserts would have been fantastic. we will have on next visit. My friend could not wait to tell her daughter about this place so they could try it.   James did an excellent job with everything.   I yelp alot and this place is defiently a 10 stars.  If your reading this do yourself a favor try this place. Reasonable prices, good soft music playing, comfy.  you wont be sorry"}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian food. Food is freshly made, so that's a plus. I had chicken Alfredo, and it was the best I've ever had. My father in law had lasagna and he said it was great! We ordered pickup for 7 people and it came out in a fair time. Great customer service from this family company."}
{"text":"We dined at Adela's last night, and it was amazing.... We found a little corner of Italian restaurant heaven on Thomas Rd right here in Phoenix ....  My entree of lobster ravioli in a delicious cream vodka sauce , and decorated with an abundance of perfectly cook shrimp was excellent.... The soup we started with was perfection.... Thanks to our family for showing us a wonderful meal, fantastic server, and a awesome restaurant for amazing dining, we will be going back again, and again.... Everyone should experience dining at Adela's, it is a dining treat that you will keep returning for more.... I can't say enough great things about Adela's. From the Cocktails right down to the specialty coffees and desserts  this is our new favorite restaurant.... Italian food at its finest...."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant at first because of the location, but what can I say!? It certainly didn't disappoint me. It was delicious! Per the recommendation of my very friendly attentive waiter, I ordered the Pollo Al Limone paired with the Brancott Sauvignon Blanc. It was perfect. The calamari and bread were also very tasty! This place is definitely worth trying out!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Awesome service . They make the best strawberry icetea ever!!! I totally  recommend it. Gnocchi are so creamy... homemade."}
{"text":"The staff was all wonderfully friendly. My boyfriend got the fettuccine Alfredo and I got the fettuccine primavera. Both were fantastic. The serving size was nice; not much left for leftovers. There was complimentary hot bread (only complaint was the butter was too hard, but I had olive oil and balsamic anyways).  The optional diner salad was only a couple of dollars and was good but very simple. The owner came out to check on us (her husband was the chef). We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"There are not enough stars to truly show how great this place is!!! The food is absolutely superb!!! The service is amazing and the price is unbeatable!! This is a true diamond in the rough.  If you don't try them out you are really missing out. And when you do try them you will be back for more!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food , Wow great prices excellent service. The chef must take pride in what he does. This was an exceptional find. My favorite new place to eat. Great for the family and friends or just 1 or 2 people. And no need to dress up. It's casual dining."}
{"text":"Went to Adela's last night for the first time and was very impressed.  This little hole-in-the-wall has a great, relaxing,  atmosphere. All of their food is homemade and authentic.  It is a family owned restaurant, where dad was cooking, son was serving,... They have a nice outdoor patio to sit at and it's small enough where everyone seats themselves.   They start the meal off with garlic bread that is fresh from the oven.  My husband and I both ate off of the specialty menu for the evening. I had the lobster ravioli in a vodka cream sauce, that had large bits of shrimp mixed in.  He had the beef ravioli in a marinara sauce. He was concerned when he first saw that there were so few on the plate, but by the end of the meal we were quite content.    It was a little pricy ($44 for a glass of wine and 2 entrees) and service slightly slow, but it was nice not to feel rushed. We will definitely be back.  This was the first Italian place in the area that we have found that isn't hipster or overly hyped.  Wonderful job!"}
{"text":"Small, quaint and family owed, I was presently surprised at how good the food and the presentation was. The lobster and shirmp ravioli  was great and so was the cheesecake."}
{"text":"Delicious food, extremely clean and cute little place. Very intimate atmosphere and kind staff. Recommended 100% !"}
{"text":"Great food , great service we had the best Valentine's day dinner. Definitely would recommend this spot to anyone looking for good home cooked Italian food ."}
{"text":"Made our second visit to Adela's tonight and enjoyed it even more than the first time last summer. Gracious and attentive service with absolutely delicious meals -- our table enjoyed seafood, veal and chicken dishes that delighted us.  We'll be back soon!  Adela's is a real gem."}
{"text":"1st time here, everything was delicious.  Started with the warm bread covered with parmesan sprinkles, had stuffed mushrooms appetizer and lobster ravioli for dinner.    Italian espresso!   Will definitely come back on our next visit to AZ."}
{"text":"This was a cute little hole in the wall that was surprisingly very good!  After a long day of house hunting on a triple digit Saturday afternoon we stumbled in here fatigued, dehydrated and starving...We needed wine pronto :)  It was pretty deserted so we sat where ever we wanted.  Our waitress was friendly and explained the special soup of the day they had.  It sounded good, so my Husband ordered some.  He said it was pretty good, just piping hot, so he actually waited to the end of the meal to eat it.  For our entrees I ordered the lemon pepper shrimp linguine and he got the chicken parm, but with veggies instead of pasta.  We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals!!  I love shrimp and pasta and this had a great tanginess to it.  Would have been even better with pecorino romano cheese on top, but all they had was the freshly grated parm.  It was still good.  Don't let the sketchy strip mall atmosphere fool ya, this place makes food with authentic TLC.  We'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Heard good things but they were closed when we showed up. Their web site said they were open. It's 2015 - businesses that don't update their information online are maddening and unprofessional. Thanks for the messed up dinner plans. :("}
{"text":"It was wonderful  service was great. Food was fabulous and definitely will be going back.  Everything our waiter recommended was just delicious. Loved it"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great prices and wonderful staff - especially Xochitl - Treat yourself to a super culinary experience!"}
{"text":"Great place. Authentic al dente Italian. Pulls no punches. Family owned and served. You can't go wrong. Limited wine list, mostly itals.   Had 2 meals here. Can't wait to go back. It's always good.    Had the special, osso bucco first time. To die for.   Restaurant closes 2 weeks in August for a well deserved break.  Chef is passionate and honest. He's from many 3-5 star restaurants. It's a great place. Simple, serene, and garlic oriented!   Love it!"}
{"text":"From walking in to leaving -the service was fantastic. This wasn't a super fancy Italian restaurant and rather small but perfect for a date night. The server even asked if the fan above us was too cold or not- definitely attentive to details. We had the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and I'm not one for appetizers usually but omg these were to die for! The wine sauce they were soaked in was spot on! My boyfriend had the seafood linguine special of the day and he was beyond satisfied. Lots of clams, calamari, octopus, and mussels. There were a few vegetarian options but I was craving a pasta with white wine sauce. The server said they could make whatever I wanted so I got a vegetable linguine with lemon/garlic wine sauce. Just writing this review is making my mouth water. Loved the entire dining experience here. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this little gem, it is time to do so.  Family owned, great food, comfortable setting and decent prices. I love this spot."}
{"text":"Another Yelp winner!  From the hot bread and $2 dinner salad this place has us hooked. Entrees are great and very reasonably priced. If you're looking for a casual family place to eat you'd be hard pressed to find a better deal."}
{"text":"Been here a few times & I love it! The people who work here are very nice. Their food is so good. If you go I recommend you order the chicken fettuccine you won't regret it. You'll leave full. I would give them a 5 but both times I've gotten my food to go they have forgotten my chicken which was not cool. I already hate leaving my house in this heat so getting home and not getting what you ask for is a bummer. Let's see the dining area is kinda small, but the place is very clean. Check them out. Oh lastly I wish they would get some bruschetta on the menu that would make it perfect"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!!  Great service, great food, loved it!!  All the food was delicious the Pollo Limone with the cream sauce was very light and flavorful. Excellent t choice. Will come back."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. We went there ready to use our Entertainment Book 2-1 coupon, but it was not to be. They have a sign on the front window babbling about some misprint in the book and that they do not accept the coupon.  Translation - this is a cheap family who won't honor the coupon. If your in the book, take the coupon you filthy cheap owners. I did not buy the book to have you not take what's in the book. Do not patronize these liars."}
{"text":"Really delicious Italian food, friendly service, and a comfortable, casual setting. I could eat a meal of just the pasta sauces, they're so incredible."}
{"text":"This place is great! I had the Manicotti perfect portions  the staff is super friendly! Full bar I will have to come back and try!  I love that is a local family owned business!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal.  Got the Gorgonzola salad. Fresh, nice dressing, with plenty of pieces of Gorgonzola.  Also got the Penne Arrabbiata with sausage. Very tasty, and spicy (but not too spicy).  For dessert, the cheesecake was yummy and beautifully presented.  The service was very good.  Constant refills on my drinks, and the appropriate amount of checking in by the servers.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"**DID NOT TRY FOOD**  Unfortunately I didn't get to try Adela's. I came around 2:45 pm on a Friday afternoon and was told they were closed because they were shopping for dinner. Hours advertise they are open from 11am-10pm. He advised I come back within an hour, but that would have been too long of a wait."}
{"text":"We love Adela's Italian. It is definitely a hole in the wall place that we just happened to come across one day and try. The food is delicious and reasonably priced. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars over 5 is that the atmosphere is not up to par with their food. At first glance, when walking into the restaurant, you might not have high expectations. Other than the basic decor, the food is top notch! I'd recommend Adela's to my friends or anyone looking to get some large portions of delicious Italian food."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Real Italian food that is perfect! The wine was awesome and we had all the recommendations we could ask for. The service was beyond compare!! LOVE!!"}
{"text":"The wait staff was very attentive and good at describing and making recommendations The food was all homemade and delicious with a lot of selection and reasonable prices. We sat in the patio with a nice pond and beautiful Italian music playing and could smell all the great smells from the kitchen."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS little gem. Excellent and prompt customer service. The bread is warm, fresh and homemade served with a slab of butter. Quint little patio tucked away from the blazing heat. Oh, and reasonably priced (kinda cheap actually)."}
{"text":"Very delishes!! So authentic and fresh! Had their calamari and chicken Alfredo added some shrimp and came out so good! Definetly will be back!"}
{"text":"What is better than a sweet, family owned business!? Not much in my book! Adela's is run by an adorable family who truly cares about the quality of their food and the happiness of their customers. I came here with my family for dinner and we were MORE than impressed! From the homemade bread to start, to the escargot for an appetizer, delicious entrees and limoncello to finish, it was a truly amazing experience! I ordered the Chicken Piccata (and added artichoke hearts, of course!) -- it was FABULOUS! I wanted to drink the sauce with a spoon. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Honestly I'm not a fan of Italian food but Adela's changed my entire life!!!! Food and service was above exceptional and I would recommend this to everyone! I hope they open a location in Atlanta!"}
{"text":"Outstanding authentic Italian food. You can taste the homemade love. We were greeted with delicious garlic bread as we sat down. I had the fresh clams with linguini in olive oil and garlic. Hubby had fettuccine with homemade sausage and peppers. Both were superb. Fabulous neighborhood find!"}
{"text":"Very nice family owned place.  Food is simple and well prepared.  I had the Eggplant Sorrentina, it was very good.  My husband had 1/2 eggplant parmigiana and 1/2 chicken parmigiana.  They were very nice to let him customize his order.  Also, for kids, they would do any dish for a half portion.  My little girl likes spaghetti with olive oil and parmesan cheese and my boy loves spaghetti with marinara.  I finished my meal with a delicious canoli."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food ticked away at 40th St and Thomas!!!  For an appetizer we had the insalata all caprese which was excellent. My wife had the gnocchi alla vodka and I had the pollo marconi.  Both dishes were excellent as well!!!  Service was phenomenal!!  My water glass was never empty.   This is a must visit for some excellent Italian food!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Italian food I've had in the valley in a LONG time. I used to go to a place that asks u to \"come in!\" In Italian (I'll let u figure that out : ) but the food has gone downhill. Adela's has been constantly good since the first time my brother and I walked in. Super quaint, super dope staff, and the chicken Parmesan is out of pocket!! One thing that stood out to me: THE BREAD! Free bread usually is just that.. but something about what they serve stands out. It's like a mix of brioche and Italian. Awesomeness in a loaf! Try Adela's out. You won't be disappointed l."}
{"text":"The food was good service was very quick. Good for Arizona Italian but coming from an Italian home and living in the north east for a while just didn't stack up."}
{"text":"Best gnocchi with vodka sauce I've ever had. Service was great, waiters were very prompt with food and drinks. Their recommendations on food was awesome."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! if you're looking for a place that you can come and feel like home, friendly and family oriented you should come here to Adela's! I feel like they really are friendly with the hospitality there and generous. It's great I love this place!  The food just keeps getting better. I recommend the manicotti, fettuccini primavera and chicken parmesan.    I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Strongly recommend!!  Food is fast and outstanding.  Large portions.  Was not expecting much since it is in a strip mall, but am very impressed.  Family owned."}
{"text":"After reading reviews and seeing the star rating, my sister in law and I decided to try it since we like to support local places.  It was not very crowded for Friday lunch time, we ordered and I received eggplant parmigiana and it was soggy and cold and tasted terrible.  No crispness, nothing.  I told the waiter and he said if remade it would be the same bc of the cheese and sauce!!  Not sure how since should of been crispy to start and baked in an oven, but whatever.  The sauce tasted ragu like and so I didn't want a different meal so I decided to eat tiramisu, I think it would of been good if it did have the refrigerator taste.  Overall not a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe this was not on find me gluten free!! Home grown, homemade Italian. EVERYTHING IS MADE FROM SCRATCH! The gf pasta was probably the best pasta I have ever had in my 15 years being a celiac. The owners were so sweet and knowledgeable. Only gf items salad and pastas. All the sauces including Alfredo were also gf! We ordered the Tuscan and Sausage and peppers pasta! They were both phenomenal!! As a celiac looking for good Italian this is the place for a great plate of homemade gf pasta!"}
{"text":"We were a little disappointed after reading so many great reviews on this place.  Our favorite Italian place in Tempe recently closed for good, so we are in search of a new \"go to\" place.  Sadly, I don't think that Adela's will be a suitable replacement.  We ordered one lasagna and one linguine with calamari.  Both dishes lacked flavor and seasoning and the pasta was over cooked with no texture or substance.  I piled on the salt and grated Parmesan, but that only slightly helped.    We were also surprised at the portion size on the lasagna for the price.  It was quite small, but due to the overcooked and under flavored nature, that did not really matter."}
{"text":"Incredible food. The chicken with lemon cream sauce was the best. Family owned and you can taste it in the food."}
{"text":"A family joint.  Love on the plate.  Clean, quick, and very easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"Amazing service!  LOVED the shrimp and baby clams linguini.  The lasagna was also good.  Thank you for a lovely first time here.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"They have outside seating but will forget you're outside. Food is very subpar as well. They were also very understaffed. Overall not a great experience."}
{"text":"So I just had a meal at Adela's. Given my background as an educated chef, and professional work in Italy, I tend to walk in to such places with a heightened sense of judgement and criticism. It might not stand out as the most indigenous of Italian environments, but the food speaks for itself. I'm delightfully amazed by the chefs good handle of Italian cuisine as well as presentation. Money well spent on flavorful foods and friendly hands on service."}
{"text":"This is the spot for the best Italian I have had in years. Family owned business makes all difference. I had the special of the night (ossobuco). It was soft, tender, and a large cut. The bread is great by itself. Kids had spaghetti with meatballs. I could make a meal of just meatballs. The salads were great as well. Only problem was all the food was so good we didn't have room to try dessert. I recommended this place to our family that lives in Phoenix that we we visiting. If I lived closer this would be one of my weekly stops! Highly recommend everybody check it out."}
{"text":"We have been searching for a quaint Italian restaurant in this or any area to replace our long time favorite that used to be in Scottsdale, but has long since closed.   This is how we happened upon this charming little establishment. It's not the most ornate, nor the most elegant of restaurants; but it certainly has a charm of its own.  For appetizers, I ordered the Escargot. Having tasted some of the very best Escargots in many countries, I didn't have very high expectations. However, I was in the mood for snails for some reason.   For the main course, my wife ordered the Penne All' Arrabbiata, and I ordered the Pollo Primavera.   First the Escargots. As expected, they weren't the best that I had ever had, but they were passable. Their flavor wasn't distinct enough, and they were a little bit overdone.   However, both our main courses had wonderful flavors. The chicken, and especially the sausage on my wife's meal were just wonderful.  The cream sauce on my Pollo Primavera was distinct, but it did not overwhelm the taste of the chicken.   The portions were fairly large, and we were only able to consume half of our meals. Our server was so concerned that we didn't enjoy our food, and we had to allay her concern but simply stating that the food was marvelous - there was just so much of it, not that we were complaining.   It certainly was a gem of a restaurant worth discovering!"}
{"text":"Rare to find good Italian restaurant in the valley.  The food and service exceeded expectations. Thanks for your service, we will be back."}
{"text":"My family and I stumbled on this place as we were passing through  Phoenix in our travels.  What a find. It happen to be my mom's 80th birthday and she loved it. My brother and I enjoyed it as well.The food was delicious and a good combination of traditional Italian fare served along with some other interesting entrees. I feasted on the Pollo Marconi which consisted of a chicken breast layered with slices of tomato, mushroom, eggplant, ham and cheese, baked in a tomato Marsala cream sauce. It was HEAVEN. My brother enjoyed the veal in lemon sauce and my mom ordered the pasta with shrimp. There was even FRESH baked bread. Our server Jaime was wonderful as well and as a treat he served my mom the most delicious Tiramisu in honor of her birthday. If we lived closer this would definitely be a favorite of ours.  It is located in a strip mall but once you open the doors you are transformed to a some fine Italian dining at the most reasonable price.  Don't miss out on this gem of a place."}
{"text":"We've eaten Italian food all over the USA and Europe and Adela's is among the best we've ever eaten. We ate there two nights during our Phoenix visit and can't say enough about how wonderful the experience was. We had chicken parmesana, chicken piccata, veal marsala and shrimp d'avolio and all were superb! For dessert, the tiramisu was the best we've had anywhere! Sorry for the exclamation points, but Adela's is just plain outstanding! Chef Pedro and his son, Jaime are talented and personable."}
{"text":"Just not up to snuff with all of the great Italian restaurants in AZ.  Marginal gnocchi, eggplant, and meatballs."}
{"text":"I have traveled all over and I must say this is one of my favorite restaurants. The Shrimp and Lobster Ravioli was so good I went back the next day and ordered a larger portion hahahaha. I had to ask the chef to come out and shake my hand. He was very nice. 5 stars WAY WAY up"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place when I was in the area and had the hankering for some pasta. The food was neither good nor bad, it was just ok. It's a small place and the location is unsuspecting. It was almost hidden or tucked in a strip mall corner.   The service, the bread, the balsamic vinegar and olive oil were all good. But the main dish, was ok. I ordered the linguini alle vongole and the clams were a bit over cooked. Most Italian restaurants I've been to where I've ordered the same or similar dish, the clams are usually still in the shell. That's when I can tell the freshness. But, I suspected their clams were probably canned clams.   I have no plans in eating here in the near future."}
{"text":"This is handsdown my favorite restaurant in Arizona! I am full blooded italian and moved here a few months ago away from all of the great cookers in my family. Since i no longer have home-cooked italian dishes, this is the place I go in order to fix all of my cravings. I bring everyone here that comes into town to visit and I've gotten the gnocchi bolognese everytime - never to disappoint. Everyone that works here is so awesome - always friendly, sociable and welcoming. You cannot go wrong - great place, great food!"}
{"text":"I dined at Adela's for the first time tonight and loved the food!  I had the meat lasagna, my husband had fettucini alfredo with peas, bacon and mushroom and my son had baked ziti.  The food is delicious and the service outstanding!"}
{"text":"What amazing food. Who knew there was such a gold mine tucked away in my neighborhood. The atmosphere is nice and so was the hospitality. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and it was better than anything I had in Italy. The sauce was very creamy and the pasta was cooked just right. It was served with a fantastic little loaf of garlic bread. The best part was how reasonable the price was. The whole meal was an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"We were weary travelers passing through Phoenix, about to get on a plane and we stumbled upon Adela's.  My daughter loved the fettucine alfredo (flavorful and not overly doused in sauce) and I enjoyed the manicotti. The bread was freshly made and very good - we had to stop ourselves. Relaxed, homey atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Excellent. From the servers recommendations and descriptions to the food. Ambiance is ok, nice strip mall place but the food was wonderful. Great value for the price. Stuffed chicken was the day's special and amazing."}
{"text":"We went a few weeks ago before going out of town and enjoyed the food.   The ambiance is ok but the food is better.   I like to support local owners and we were glad that we went. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I visited this cozy little Italian restaurant. They have a waterfall and pond in the courtyard they are planning on setting tables and chairs next to. The wine selection was good and the special I had which was a mixture of seafood in a slightly spicy tomato sauce over linguine. I also ordered the caprese salad ........... refreshingly amazing. The service is friendly and open. I will definitely have dinner there again when I am in Phoenix. I don't write many reviews, but I needed to write this one."}
{"text":"still and away - the best italian restaurant in town fresh made food each and every day, the most wonderful owners and staff go once a week at least"}
{"text":"First time in to pick up an order to go, everyone was so nice and the food was fantastic! I had the caprese salad and manicotti. Can't wait to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I was liking for an Italian restaurant and couldn't believe how many stars Adele's had since this wasn't our experience. The food was awful. It was like getting frozen pasta heated up with jar/canned sauce. The staff seemed nice but it didn't help enough. I was soooo disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. Bread is home-made. Pasta is ab-fab. Sauces are so tasty. Prices are very fair. We will be back."}
{"text":"The best homemade gnocchi ever. Great flavor and the quantity size was spot on. Also got the linguine calamari with spicy tomato sauce. It was delicious. Great service too. All the around a definite place we will return to when visiting the Phoenix area"}
{"text":"This place had great service and great food, I would definitely recommend the baked ziti, I loved it!"}
{"text":"I loved Adela's!  Small, neighborhood restaurant that's very cute inside despite it's strip mall location!  We started with the fried calamari.  Now you should really like calamari to order this because it is not fried to an unrecognizable food that could be anything...zucchini, cheese, a shoe.  I really liked the spicy marinara it was served with as well.  My husband had the baked ziti of which there was little left.  I had the special of lobster ravioli.  Really good, although I was surprised there were shrimp on top.  The server did not mention that.  But when I overheard another server, I realized we got the abridged version of the specials in general.  But she was very nice and attentive.  And the tiramisu was very good as well.  Will definitely return.  Maybe tomorrow in fact!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. always so homey feeling and everything on the menu is amazing. Calamari is the best I've had in a long time and all the pasta dishes are great. My go-to italian place for sure."}
{"text":"This local Italian food restaurant was so good. The staff was so nice. And great food"}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic! Bread is homemade, marinara sauce is divine, service is excellent! Prices are very reasonable. Family owned, unassuming restaurant. We feel like we stumbled upon a gem in the heart of Phoenix/Arcadia. Also, this family owns a water and ice store so the water is SO GOOD! I know that sounds funny but most restaurants serve nasty Phoenix tap water...this one does not. We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was maybe even better!  The gentleman that waited on us was very friendly and helpful in making suggestions to accommodate my 9 year old daughters picky tastes. The bread was fresh and warm, our glasses never empty, and again the food was wonderful."}
{"text":"Amazing family owned Italian restaurant with authentic Italian food. They had great drink specials with fresh baked bread that was so good. We ordered the fettuccini alfredo and fettuccini toscana which were both out of this world. The fettuccini alfredo was creamy, not dry like other restaurants. Perfect restaurant if you are looking for a cozy spot with amazing food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We stopped in today and it was wonderful!  I had lobster ravioli with shrimp and my partner had another chicken and pasta dish.  It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. Father cooked and son provided us with great service.  Certainly worth a visit and share with your family and friends."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. We were super excited to try this new italian restaurant in our neighborhood. Here is how our experience went; we arrived at 745pm, there was ONE other table seated that owner was speaking with, he did not acknowledge us, and a waiter came out 5 minutes later and sat us.   We asked for water. The waiter mentioned that they were out of house wine and would be substituting it with Franzia red wine (from the box), and proceeded to mention that it is the same wine that college students get drunk on and he would recommend a bottle. Why not substitute a better wine for the house wine you are out of??   Bread came out-housemade and good! We asked for water again.  Our wine came out (not Franzia), we asked for water again--still waiting on this.  Our meals arrived and mine was probably the worst eggplant dish I have ever had. The sauce was very good on the pasta, my husband had the chicken parmigiana and said it was average. I asked the chef if this dish was supposed to be this way (as it was really not the same as any other eggplant dish I've had, and he said that was normal).. It was $40 for 2 dishes and one glass of wine without tip.   While we are now the only table in the restaurant, the waiter is NOISILY cleaning silverware and throwing it in the dish pan, and the dishwasher is running in the back, so much for our romantic date night.   Our waters were never refilled, took 15 minutes to get our check--we are the ONLY table in the entire restaurant!   We will not be back and will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"By far, the best Italian food I've ever had. And I've had Italian food in Italy! So very good. Good atmosphere. Friendly and attentive staff. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Things that make you go hmmmm. I'm going to break some hearts with this one. This place got 4 1/2 stars but I wouldn't rate it above three stars after my first visit there. I got the eggplant parmagiano. The pasta had a very bland tomato paste flavor and it was kind of watery. The eggplant was soggy. I'm a bit of an eggplant snob since having my girl's mom's eggplant. She makes the best eggplant with pasta. This place breaded it by baking it but didn't fry it. As a result, it turned out extremely soggy. My salad was very good, the garlic bread was tasty. I did get the cannoli. I liked the cannoli because it wasn't too sweet. The service saves this place because the service was really good and they care about taking care of their guests. I had a taste of the lobster ravioli and it was pretty tasty. I would be willing to go back and give this place another shot. I will just stay as faaaaaaaaaaaar away from the eggplant as possible."}
{"text":"Friendly neighborhood place. The food is prepared with care and is absolutely fresh and delicious. My husband and I are Italian... it's our favorite!!  We're snowbirds so we miss it when we're gone.  Great hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"I am giving this four stars only because of the dessert.    Otherwise, I would give it three.   I went there the other day for lunch with a friend.    I had read about it on Yelp, saw that it had decent reviews, and suggested we go.     I had the fettucchine della casa with chicken and she had the lasagna.      First, my review of her lasagna.    I am NOT a fan of tomato-based sauces, therefore, that is why I don't order those type of dishes.    She LOVED it.     I thought it was okay.    Tasted like lasagna.   My dish, on the other hand, was good.    I wish it had more chicken, since one has to pay extra for it.    Thankfully, it was not boiled.    UGHHH!     I hate the taste and texture of boiled chicken!   It was either fried or roasted, and was good.   The flavors in the pasta were good.    Not fabulous but good.   My friend wanted to try the desserts.   That's how much she loved her lasagna.   She wanted to experience more of the menu.   We ordered the .   WHOA!!!    Yummmm!!     If it would have been polite, I would have licked the plate.    Jaime, the son of Pedro, the owner, told us everything was homemade, including the desserts.    I will believe it.    I would have liked to have ordered it for my complete lunch or, at least, taken some home, but I could not imagine how many calories it has.     Since we were the only customers in the restaurant, Jaime was able to talk to us.    Father was clearly visible, but didn't come over to say \"hi.\"    Must be shy.    Jaime said the restaurant had only been open three months, and was very busy for the dinner hour.    They are going to have music later.    There are murals on the wall, and he said they were going to have more.    Hopefully, not too much, or the walls will look too busy.     I would definitely like to order the tiramisu to go.    I wonder if I can order a whole cake??    Hmmm"}
{"text":"Calamari with homemade marinara sauce  Freshly baked garlic bread  Shrimp Scampi  Tiramisu"}
{"text":"How cute is this little gem? The music creates the ambiance. Most of the items are homemade and are delish. Very quiet during lunch but picks up around 6 pm. Hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"This review is difficult to write because the family is so sweet. But I need to be honest. I went there on a  Saturday night there were only two tables eating. I get it it's a new business.   The decorations are drab. It's an awful blinding white. With some mural on one wall. They have this mirror behind the cash register and you can see in the back. Like zip lock bags and storage things. This is not  appetizing. It's sort of unprofessional. So they have these vintage stools that are terrible.   I ordered to-go. I ordered shrimp and chicken fettuccine  and a Gorgonzola salad it came with garlic bread. I also had a glass of Kendal Jackson.   So let's start with the salad. It was that garden mix that is pre rinsed from Walmart. Terrible how difficult is it to cut some lettuce. There was hardly any Gorgonzola at all. The bread was also generic with no taste at all. I was so disappointed.  The fettuccine was also from the box not fresh made. For $19.00 I wanted if not authentic Italian food at least fresh.  The sauce was decent but defiantly not enough the pasta was dry. The chicken were five pieces of dry chicken breast cubes and beige cut so small. The shrimp were plump and cook perfectly.   So I wouldn't return. When speaking to the mother she said their food wasn't fast food but Olive Garden is far more superior than my experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Fan-tast-ic!! I was pleasantly surprised the first time I stopped in here for dinner with a friend. We loved the food, service & price so much that we have returned many times. I would recommend this restaurant to any Italian still searching for good Italian food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant!  The family atmosphere and the VERY high quality food and wine, at affordable prices cannot be beat!  The Chicken Piccata is literally the best I've ever had!   Chef Pedro and his team are so wonderful!"}
{"text":"This has become my \"go to\" favorite Italian place in the valley.  Great food!  Went with two friends, we loved each of our dishes!  It was fresh and hot and had delicious flavor.  The cocktails were great too.  The staff was fast, courteous, and helpful with picking items off the food and drink menu.  Will be back there soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing hospitality, good quality food. We visited from LA and enjoyed our lunch even though we were in a large group of 8 the service was very fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Everything from the bread, salad, fettuccine della casa, to the tiramisu was awesome! I enjoyed every bite, until I was ready to pop."}
{"text":"Dinner was delish. We ordered fried calamari and it was excellent. Hot and lightly breaded with a delish sauce. Enjoyed a tasty salad. The best were the entrees. Each were unique and fantastic. We were celebrating 2 birthdays and I joked that I had reserved the entire restsurant. The prices were very reasonable.  All entrees were under $20 except for the seafood special. The fresh baked bread was excellent... though I wish I could have resisted! We had the tiramisu and a slice of cheesecake for dessert. Perfect.....and I don't usually even like dessert!!! I am pretty particular and just really enjoyed our evening. Love independent restaurants! !!!!!"}
{"text":"Great family-owned italian restaurant!! Friendly staff and wonderful service! Prices are more than reasonable for the quality and quantity of food! I had the fettuccine Alfredo and a side of meatballs and both items were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service!   Quaint little local restaurant with really good food. Free homemade bread with meal. We asked for oil and balsamic on the side and it was delicious!   The best part was the gnocchi with vodka cream sauce with added chicken and the lobster ravioli with shrimp was so delicious!"}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner out. The bread was fresh and warm. Gorgonzola salad was excellent. Pasta was yummy. We finished the meal with a cannoli, which was the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"We were looking for a great Italian place to take the place of our favorite, now closed, La Calabria. Based on the reviews I thought we might find it.   Unfortunately, we didn't.   While it wasn't bad, it was OK. And if I want just OK, there are plenty of places. I do like that it's a small family restaurant and Chef Pedro comes out to greet the tables, but the food didn't live up to what we've come to expect of great Italian restaurants.   The special of Shrimp and Salmon in a vodka sauce was overwhelmed by the salmon with no real punch in the sauce.   The puttanesca flavors didn't blend well and the house salad was lettuce with two grape tomatoes.   Props for friendly service.   While it wasn't horrible it's too far for us to drive for average food."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here based on the reviews. I must admit I was worried in having it delivered vs dining in. Dinner arrived 30 mins earlier than expected and was hot! The food was high quality and very delicious. We ordered eggplant parmigiana and fettuccine Alfredo with a  salad it came with bread. Everything was a hit and I look forward to going in sitting down a dining."}
{"text":"That had to be the best Italian meal I've had.  The atmosphere was superb, the service was the best ever and the linguini principipessa was so amazing, with a wonderful merlot, house salad and bread the meal was perfect and of course the homemade tiramisu had to go home with me for later.  Definite place to go for a little romantic atmosphere."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout and it was almost inedible. We can't understand the good reviews. My vodka sauce was runny and so salty I could barely eat it. The bread tasted stale and dry, and they did not include the butter when I specifically asked for bread and butter since we recently moved. The portions were tiny. My husband's linguini was lackluster. I agree with the previous reviewer who said this place maybe good in person, but for takeout it is zero. Maybe they give takeout the shaft? Will not go back."}
{"text":"We loved this little place!  Service was exceptional and attentive.  Staff was charming, polite, and the food was authentic and the best ravioli's I've tasted in awhile!  Highly recommend this to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Went here with niece and nephews. Wanted to try something local. Had the stuffed mushrooms which were good but didn't stand out. Had the beef ravioli with arrabiatta sauce. I may be spelling that wrong. :). It had the perfect amount of spice but just a little on salty side. I've cut back on salt so that may just be me. My niece had chicken with pasta with a marsala cream sauce. It was excellent. My nephews had a penne pasta with arrabiatta sauce and the other spaghetti and meat balls. Both were good. Service was very excellent and very attentive. A solid 4 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Italian spots I've had in Phoenix. Our group ordered various dishes and every one was excellent! We started with the fresh made bread and stuffed mushrooms, both we very tasty. We each had the gnocchi al a vodka, the cheese ravioli in pesto sauce, pasta marconi and eggplant florentino. Each dish was equally tasty the sauces were flavorful and creamy. Portions were enough to share :). We ended with tiramasu and a canoli and were not disappointed. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I always struggle to write a negative review, but I just got home and realized I just payed 130 bucks for one of the most mediocre meals ever. The chicken Marsala was bland, they call it something else but it's chicken Marsala. The calamari was rubbery, and the wine was over priced. We arrived and were told to seat ourselves them the server kind of ignored us until his Mom came and checked on us. The reviews I read had me really excited and we skipped dinner at our favorite Italian place up the street to give it a try. The server righted the ship in the end as far as the service goes but the food was just average."}
{"text":"Wow!  In a strip mall, but FANTASTIC!  So glad we found this place online.  In Phoenix for business.  Drink and dinner menus had plenty of choices.  Able to request meal to be dairy free- server was glad to help and confirm with chef.  Pasta was cooked perfectly and marinara sauce was tasty.  Would definitely visit again if in the area."}
{"text":"Outstanding food!!!  There best calamari appetizer we've ever had.  My wife's veal in lemon pasta is the best she's ever had outside of Italy.  My prawns and pasta be is a 10 or you 10!  The cannoli is to die for!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't too bad but food is mediokay. Still recommended for a moms and pops Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Saw this place tucked away in the corner of the plaza and tried it out tonight... DELICIOUS! Very neat and clean inside, Sinatra playing softly and a small pond and fountain outside the window. The bread was warm, soft and scrumptious with a hint of garlic. Calamari was fresh and crisp with a delicious spicy tomato sauce. We had the Chicken Marconi and Penne All Arrabiata both were delectable and we ate every morsel... All but licked the plate! It seems others haven't discovered this gem because we were the only ones there at 5:00. We HIGHLY recommend giving it a try! We'll be back"}
{"text":"so we came here when visiting Phoenix because of the great reviews. the servers were friendly. the food was average. didn't really see the wow factor for this joint but pretty good for a local mom&pop shop."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my family, and it was super good. The bread at the beginning was excellent. My parents got house salads at the beginning which were 1.99 each. I wanted a Caesar salad, but it was 4.99. The waitress there said I could have a Caesar salad for 1.99 after my parents said it was too expensive. I ordered Chicken Piccata which came with pasta. The sauce was really lemony but very good. Now to the service, the reason for 5 stars. The waitress who served us was incredibly friendly, funny, and nice. At the end of our meal, she thanked us for coming and said it was nice to meet us. Adela's is a great Italian restaurant and I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner with friends and each had a different dish: chicken cacciatore, chicken with a spicy tomato sauce, lasagna, and clam in a white wine sauce. We all thought each dish was phenomenal! We would highly recommend! This is a family-owned and run establishment. They are super friendly as well."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian restaurant in town!! Amazing and delicious food and dessert. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. This place never disappoints. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I have been to Adela's Italian 3 times with friends and family and can't wait till my next visit. We start off with an ice cold Peroni and mom has glass of house red wine .For an appetizer we order the calamari which is served with the best homemade marinara sauce I have ever had . Mom had chicken with lemon butter and garlic. I had meat lasagna. Both homemade and cooked to perfection.For dessert we both had a cannoli and espresso. Almost forgot we were served the most delicious homemade bread and butter. Family owned and great service."}
{"text":"Wow, delicious, homemade-style fettucini alfredo.  This is the real deal!  And I am happy I listened and chose the cannoli- probably the best cannoli I've had.  Buenísimo!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Great staff, good food, and good music! The pasta was absolutely delicious! It felt like we were in Little Italy. Definitely a place to visit!"}
{"text":"My mom and I came here for lunch. We were so impressed with the service and the food. It's tucked away in a strip mall, but has a nice patio. The fresh bread was amazing and I ordered some of the  best linguine with clams I've ever had. My mom had fettuccine with peas, mushrooms and bacon that was to die for. We topped it off with a yummy cannoli. It is apparent that everything is homemade with fresh ingredients. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always delicious home made Italian food. Willing to accept substitutions and always very accommodating. Plenty of parking as its situated in the corner of a large strip mall. And very well priced.  Theres plenty of seating both inside and out on the patio, but given that there's a patio; there are often flies and gnats buzzing about. We've never had any issues with them but they do get a bit annoying.  The owner is a very sweet woman, makes you feel like you're chatting with your Italian grandmother. Very inviting and welcoming. I always have a very pleasant time eating here."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here last night at 6pm. Initially we were a little concerned, because the ambiance is very simple-- one large room with tables and a small bar. But in the end, the food was fresh, flavorful, and \"real\" Italian food. We will definitely be coming back regularly.  Our waiter, who was the son of the cook (who i assume owns the restaurant) was great and had good recommendations.  We ordered a Caesar salad as our appetizer, the Penne All' Arrabbiata with sausage and Scampi Fra Diavolo with Tiramisu as our dessert. The salad we learned, used a house made Caesar dressing, was incredibly flavorful but the presentation could have been better. The entrees were great, tasting like the dinners I had growing up in an Italian household. Portions were of adequate size, not overwhelmingly large, and not small. The tiramisu was also authentic, light, and delicious.  Overall, this is a hidden gem in Arcadia. Its not fancy, which makes it a nice casual choice for dinner, and the pricing is about average to a little high. Our bill, without alcohol, was just under $50. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service!  Very authentic Northern and Southern Italian food with a chef owner that is humble and happy to serve people great food.  Everyone in our party of 9 enjoyed the food.  You must read the descriptions of the foods if you are not familiar with names but all the food we ordered (we got like 6 different dishes) were wonderful.  Personally I had a seafood and cream sauce pasta. So creamy and rich, and the shrimp are cooked perfectly with a snap when you bite into them.  Very fresh too!  This is one of my new favorite places.  The portion as nice and big so I took half of it home as well, which helps with the prices since some of the seafood dishes are like 18 each, the rest are about 13-14.   I also concur with Stephen that this is my new favorite to replace the one that was in Scottsdale. Funny how two random ppl know exactly what place that is! I was so sad when it closed but am so happy I have found a new place that has an even more homely feel!"}
{"text":"still a great little neighborhood treasure - more people need to know about this joynt so they can prosper. Tom &  Bob & I had dinner last night - I had the veal Sorrento, Tom had Lasagna, and Bob had baked ziti - everyone was very happy with the quality and quantity of food - that is the ONLY thing that matters. And OMG the small loaves of fresh-baked garlic bread are AWESOME.  Perfect for cleaning the plate and soaking up the sauce."}
{"text":"We dined at Adela's on a Saturday night. It's a small dining area w/ outside area as well. It was getting late so it was not very busy. We we're seated right away. We had a toddler w/ us they attended to him like he was their own. The decor is modest. The service was incredible. I had the Pollo a limone. I think it might possibly be the best meal I've ever eaten out. The other adults had more traditional Italian dishes. All agreed the place was excellent!! Next time we r in Phx. we will be going back."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I love the baked ziti. Whenever i have a craving for Italian this place is what i instantly think of. The owners also work in the restaurant and i think because of that you get authentic italian food here."}
{"text":"Wow!! First time coming in because I read other reviews, and it did not disappoint! Great food and Totally Fresh! The bread that comes out is freshly made, warm, and has garlic. I had the Chicken Fettuccini and it was GREAT! My husband had the calamari and loved it! He also had the spaghetti and meatballs. Next time, he wants to try the lasagna! Staff totally was friendly and if I am in the area again, I want to come back and try more items! Great Place!!"}
{"text":"The best and my favorite Italian place ! Their food is so good ! we started off with always getting chicken alfredo & it's the best I've had ! Super creamy! We always come back just for that as well as the spaghetti & penne a la vodka !! The employees & owner are always super nice & always make us feel welcomed! I love this place !"}
{"text":"Yum what an excellent place for a relaxed romantic dinner. The food is good and it hit the spot. It appears to be locally owned and I enjoy supporting local business. Bread is perfect! Will be back for delicious Italian food."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb diggity! The bread is delicious, the food delicious, the service delicious. Ya'll need to get on board with this place. Come. Eat. Enjoy."}
{"text":"This our second time here.  The first time was because of you Yelp reviewers.  My wife had the Pollo Genovese.  Mine was Putanesca Gambari (I.e., shrimp).  Both were first class! The place looks like \"mom and pop\" from the outside, but don't be fooled.  They cook up a storm!  And we would have liked to adopt our server Jaimie and take him home with us, he was so friendly!"}
{"text":"A neat little restaurant, food was excellent!  The fettuccine alla puttanesca was the best.  Dinner with a good bottle of chanti wine, salad and desert and tip was under a $80.00.  Well worth every penny."}
{"text":"Quick service and good food; what else can you ask for. Kids ate spaghetti and meatballs. We had a salad and bake zit- yum."}
{"text":"So good.  Fetticini alfredo with chicken was awesome.  Definitely will come back next time i am here."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. The neighbors have been giving it rave reviews so I decided to give it a try. Excellent meal of penne with sausage. I sat outside with the sound of the fountain and Italian music creating a delightful ambiance. Topped it all of with a tiramisu and espresso. The tastes were complimentary and perfect. Great service. Oh, and the meal starts with freshly made bread. Pedro the owner just walked outside and said hello. He's the chef also and is very proud of his business. Now I feel like family too!!"}
{"text":"This place is tucked into the corner of an unassuming strip mall, but don't let the location fool you!  The restaurant is intimate and the food is delicious.  The staff was friendly and attentive, and everyone at our party walked away stuffed, well-pleased, and with leftovers.  Definitely will be returning, and would absolutely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"First time here - food was delicious and you definitely get the feeling that Adela and family care about their customers. Everyone  in here knows their names and they get personally greeted by the family. If I were to make one suggestion the lighting is a little bright for a Friday night but that's just us - we are on a date."}
{"text":"The best little hole in the wall family Italian restaurant!! You would never know it's there if you're just driving by, but I'm so glad we went looking for it!  It's family owned and ran, the son Jaíme was our waiter and his father, the chef!  Everything was fresh, and beyond delicious! The only thing I was sad about was missing out on the last piece of tiramisu, but I had one of the best cannoli  I've ever had instead! I will definitely be coming back and telling as many of my friends as can!"}
{"text":"Adela's has become our guilty pleasure when we want a really indulgent meal! The staff is really nice and take-out is a great option if it's packed inside - just call ahead."}
{"text":"The best Italian food I have ever experienced! You owe to yourself to try this place you will be so glad you did! Excellent service and their food is way beyond superb!"}
{"text":"First time to Adela's and it did not disappoint. Simple interior decor, very casual in a good way, and a very welcoming staff. The menu has a very nice variety of traditional Italian food. The bread is soft and hot! I had linguine and clams, and my boys had pesto ravioli. The presentation was clean, the food was hot, and the flavors were what we'd hoped for. The service was attentive and fast. The prices were very fair for what we had. A great casual place for our family, and we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The only authentic Italian restaurant I'll go from now on that is close to Arcadia. The menu alone says it all, everything is made there fresh everyday. If you order apps, I highly recommend the fried calamari which is served in their house sauce... ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! The bread is like no other and I'm told is made every morning, it's nice flakey and buttery on the outside and soft airy on the inside... just delicious! I had the chicken and lemon capers with mushrooms while my husband had the spaghetti bolognese. They were both very tasty!"}
{"text":"We had the calamari to start and it was delicious and we order the shrimp scampi diavolo it was really good artist but not least the service was great can't wait to go back there for dinner"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! Stumbled upon this little gem tonight and found it to be delicious and super authentic. My husband ordered the penne all' arrabbiata with sausage and loved the fresh flavors of the sauce and yummy sausage. I ordered a special of lobster ravioli with shrimp and was over the moon for it. There were huge chunks of lobster in the ravioli and the sauce was creamy yet light and extremely flavorful. Our meal came with fresh homemade bread with butter. The place was busy for a Saturday night but the chef came out to greet some guests celebrating a birthday. Atmosphere was cute and well drinks and domestics were super cheap. I can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"We had friends in town that wanted Italian but we needed to meet in the middle. Searched yelp, found this little gem.  Delicious and authentic. Tucked inside a nondescript plaza, don't let it fool ya. Calamari was perfect. Several of the pastas were scratch made. I had the special with a Marsala wine cream sauce. Wow! The pesto was creamy and Alfredo sauce was on point! I know because I tried a bite of everyone's meal. The place is small so make a reservation on the weekend just in case!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine wanted to take me here for dinner and I loved it so much that when I met another friend for lunch less than a week later I suggested Adela's again.   It's a small family owned restaurant in a strip mall. The first time when I came for dinner one of the owners was our waitress and she was super friendly. The friend who I came here with had been here a few times and the owner was very appreciative that she kept coming back. Funny enough, the family is NOT Italian. I believe they are from Bolivia & Mexico.   The restaurant itself isn't that big, but there's nice artwork on the wall and I liked that there was on open kitchen. They also have a patio. I also appreciated the complimentary bread. Both times I was here it tasted really fresh.   Each time I was here I had a fettuccine dishes. The first time (dinner) I had the Toscana (chicken & artichokes). I LOVED the sauce! It was a creamy marsala, and it was flavorful. The second time (lunch) I had the Paisano (bell peppers & sausage). There was plenty of meat & veggies and I really liked the red sauce.   When I came for lunch I didn't realize Adela's had a separate lunch menu. It looked as if it was a slightly condensed version of the dinner menu with most menu items costing a little less. From what I can tell the portions are the same as dinner. When I came the first time (dinner) I thought they prices were fair, and they are VERY reasonable for lunch.   I'll for sure be back!"}
{"text":"The food was great! We had gnocchi a la vodka, chicken Marsala, and bruschetta- it was all delicious! Excellent service, cozy family style ambiance, very friendly staff. Highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food. Nice cozy dinner calimari was on point..Adela was a great server!"}
{"text":"Very clean and super friendly service. Good American style Italien food. The portions are huge, so bring an appetite or just share.  The chef cooks with a lot of heart and it is a family run business.  Check it out if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Good food but the fresh baked garlic bread was the \"bomb\".  Waiter was very friendly and gave us spent service."}
{"text":"I would take out of town guests here. Decor is low key, However, food is comparable to an expensive Italian Trattoria without the high prices."}
{"text":"We came here this past Saturday (24 June) for dinner around 7:30-8pm. There were quite a few tables open so we got to choose whichever we wanted.   We started off with the Caesar salad which was good, standard as far as salads go. We also got bread and butter which was really good, the bread tasted fresh.   For dinner, I ordered the penne all' arrabbiata with chicken. It was very good! Spicy, but not too much, and the sauce was very tasty. My boyfriend ordered the pollo Marconi, which is kind of like a chicken Marsala tomato cream sauce. The sauce was so good!! We couldn't get enough. The rest of the chicken and everything was very good as well.   Overall we were very happy with our meal and thought it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Italian in phoenix, he made me pesto just because I asked. The cook kept coming out and checking up on us. The waitress was very friendly. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Second visit was a disappointment.  Service was good, but the food, while served quickly, was so so.  The penne arrabiatta with chicken was bland and watery while the Oslo bucco was overpriced, watery and tasteless.  Other dishes at our table were just ok."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! Originally being from Boston this place reminds me of the North end.  The owners were there and very welcoming had a great atmosphere. The good selections were perfect. I went with the vodka sauce gnocchi and my dinner date had the pesto raviolis. Both dishes had big portions we both left stuffed with no room for dessert. Plan on going back to try out more of the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Bomb calamari, dope in-house bread, fantastic spicy marinara.   I am pretty sure the son was the host, the mom was our waitress, and the dad was the chef. Great homey family environment. A must must go!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Service was most attentive. A go-to for Italian."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant...amazing Italian food.  Everything was fresh and awesome.  And so Italian.  Great find...just wow.  Thanks Jaime...great to meet you and love love love your food!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite \"hidden gem\" restaurant in Phoenix. We have never been disappointed with any of our meals, and we have taken friends and family there for the last two years. The owners are wonderful, very friendly and the service is perfect. Almost hate to let anyone know about this place, but in all fairness, you have to have dinner at Adela's! Don't miss desert either."}
{"text":"Great little Italian restaurant. Quiet enough for conversations yet big enough for larger parties. Food was great. Flavorful and homemade. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food  was good. The portion size was not great, however, for the price. The service wasn't particularly good. I don't think anyone really cared we were there. It's good Italian food but a bit strange in that mini mall."}
{"text":"The pollo al limon is AMAZING!!! So delicious. Its always made fresh and perfect. The desserts here are also very delicious and made from scratch. Id recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a family owned restaurant that serves FRESHLY made food. Everyone is so lovely and nice. They always make sure you are taken care of."}
{"text":"Took my parents here when they were visiting on the recommendation of a friend and it's my new favorite place in Phoenix!  Such a warm place - the family who owns this restaurant is so nice and it's so easy to feel comfortable here.  But the reason I'm giving it 5 stars is because I tried all 3 of our sauces and not to be dramatic, but I would bathe in all of them. They were so so good.   The 3 meals we had were the fettuccine Toscana, the beef ravioli and the the Penne with chicken and sausage with the arrabbiata sauce. All phenomenal. I was disappointed when we were recommended the ravioli because I'm not typically a fan, but it was actually amazing!  I don't even really write yelp reviews. This place is just that good."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has rave reviews. My husband and I found the place on Yelp and decided to order take out, so we could enjoy it with some red wine while decorating for the holidays. Unfortunately, the manicotti tasted like a once frozen and then microwaved version and was still cold in the middle. It was awful and essentially inedible. I love manicotti and this one takes the cake as the absolute worst I have ever had. So disappointed. My husbands dish wasn't much better. The bread that accompanied the meal was dry and lacked good flavor. They also failed to put butter in the bag. Very disappointed and a waste of money. Sure wish you could return terrible meals for a refund. Maybe eating in is better but don't offer take out of its this bad."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!!!!!! This place has a great atmosphere and the food is even better. Xochitl was an amazing waitress and she was working every table in there at least 25 people. From the fresh garlic bread, to the calamari, and then to the main dishes (Shrimp al Limone & Penne all Arrabiata) . Everything was great! Will come back!"}
{"text":"Adela's is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. My boyfriends family goes at least once a week and now I am just as hooked! I grew up in New York in a very Italian family and going to Adela's makes me feel right at home. The service is amazing and run by an incredibly lovely family. No matter what you order you will be extremely satisfied. This is one of those word of mouth mama/papa restaurants and hidden gem that everyone should know about! In fact, we are going again tomorrow night and I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and comfortable. Food is good , bread fresh!  Definitely will bring Mom again."}
{"text":"We've been here 4 or 5 times already and have had an excellent experience every time. The food is absolutely delicious, and the service is friendly and familial. My mother comes from a large Italian family and she insists this is one of the best Italian restaurants she's been too in Phoenix. The Ossobuco is melt-in-your-mouth and wonderfully flavorful. Additionally, they accommodate our Gluten-free son (sensitive, not allergic) by preparing GF pasta we bring with us as well as GF garlic bread we bring. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Great family owned spot! Super good food with perfect accommodating service. Great place!!"}
{"text":"Cozy, but lively, ambience. Food and wine is delicious, unique, and wonderful. Need a menu recommendation? The staff is so helpful and attentive, they'll find you something you'll love. This is my first time here, and I regret living out of town, because I want to come back!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've had in town! Their sauce is amazing, kuddos to the cook! Clean, great home made sangrias, great staff and fantastic food!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, amazing,delightful, enjoyable,family run. We enjoyed pollo Limon, Pollo parmigiano, linguine Alfredo, and the special cheese ravioli with spicy tomato sauce. Amazing service. Highly recommend it you wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"Returned with my husband and spent WAY too much money. This place is great and it was totally worth it. The cocktails were good!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Might just be the best Chicken Piccata I have ever had!  A must do when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great place with excellent food and good service. Nice ambiance with cloth napkins and tablecloth. Sinatra on sound system."}
{"text":"Come here! Order the toscana or primavera and some tiramisu and you'll be forever grateful! Family owned and operated. Jaime our server was exceptional."}
{"text":"Good Italian! Need to go back. Food was good. We were a table of 4 people having dinner-two bottles of wine $145 without tip. I ordered a capresse salad with my chicken lemon meal and was charged an additional 9.95  when I was told it was $1.99 to add a salad on. We were catching up with old family members we have not seen in a few years- and we did not notice until the next morning. I just feel the charge was unwarranted and will pay better attention next time."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise - we were in the neighborhood and are glad we gave it a try!  Very comfortable and clean, friendly attentive service, and really reasonable prices.  And most important, the dinner was delicious!  I had the Pollo Picatta, which was fork-tender and came with pasta.  My friend had a stuffed eggplant dish that was rich and creamy.  The bread was hot and fresh with a nice crust.  I ordered a Peroni, which came with an ice-cold mug.  For dessert, we split a tiramisu which was perfectly made, in-house.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I finally made it here for lunch today. I regret not going there sooner. The food is great, like my Italian mother used to make. I had the linguini with White Clam Sauce which was excellent. I also had a \"small\" Ceaser Salad which wasn't very small but very fresh with just the right amount of Ceaser dressing, not overpowering at all. When you're there check out the Olive Oil it is truly amazing.  Our waiter was great and very attentive to our needs.  I'll be going there again. Also available through Amazon Restaurants."}
{"text":"Decent Italian food in a pleasant atmosphere. The eggplant would have been better if done in a pizza oven, but the flavoring was very nice. The veggies would have benefited from time in a sauté pan, but were reasonably fresh. The salad dressing was quite good. The ambiance is pleasant and quiet as was the service. The coffee was not particularly worth drinking, especially with those horrid half and half cuppettes."}
{"text":"Simple, tasty Italian with amazing and quick service. The staff was very attentive and made sure we were taken care of!  I ordered the shrimp pasta in a lemon garlic and wine sauce.. The shrimps were huge and delicious. The sauce was a little lemon-y to my liking but I wouldn't fault that to chef.. I just don't normally order that type of sauce. Bread came out warm and tasty. I liked that the portions weren't so big that you had to take it home.. My fiancé and I brought our appetites and both finished our dinners.   No complaints! My only suggestion would be lower lighting to add to the already pretty casual ambience.. The bright lighting reminded me of eating somewhere fast food."}
{"text":"I am new to the area (Prescott) and every time I come down to Phoenix I try a  new Italian restaurant.  This is the first time I've taken the time to write a review only because  this place is that good.  Why you ask am I not giving them five stars then, in one word, ambiance.  But I rather have great food than a fancy restaurant with mediocre food. This one won't disappoint, the food is every bit as good as what I found in the best restaurants in Italy.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Looking for an affordable, family friendly, casual, Italian restaurant, Adela's fit all the criteria we were looking for. We enjoyed a nice meal of classic Italian dishes in this family run restaurant. Apologies for not knowing the son's name, but he was very cordial to us throughout our meal from offering specials when we arrived to conversing about our stay before we left.  The restaurant was easy to find with no difficulty parking out front. We were seated immediately at our 6 PM reservation in the small dining room consisting of about 8 to 10 tables and a short bar. It was a casual and comfortable atmosphere. Bread was brought out shortly with waters that were never empty throughout the meal. The menu is simple with specialty, chicken, veal, and seafood dishes.  For my entree, I enjoyed the chicken picata with a juicy chicken breast that was lightly breaded in an lemon sauce with capers that also covered the spaghetti on the side. The portion was a bit on the small side for $14.95 but still satisfying. Also ordered was the baked ziti ($11.95) and the special for the evening which was the linguine and clams with a red sauce ($17.95). My daughter split the fettucine all' alfredo ($12.95) with her friend and they were nice enough to split the portion into two separate plates. All meals were finished completely with no complaints. I do wish they served their entrees on hot plates, they were room temperature at best."}
{"text":"Like others have said this place is hidden but awesome. My girlfriend and I just kind of stumbled upon it via yelps help. The bread is great and food is amazing. I know we will be back."}
{"text":"New neighborhood favorite.   Classic Italian,  lovely family business.  The bread is soooo good, great classic caprese, shrimp a limone, great sangiovese.   Comfy, really reasonable price, really yummy food."}
{"text":"We were staying at an airport hotel & looking for a restaurant close by & we were sure lucky to find Adela's! Thanks, Yelp! The food was delicious. We had chicken piccata, spaghetti & meatballs & eggplant parmigiana. All were exceptional! The service was impeccable & the atmosphere so inviting & relaxing. We had such an enjoyable evening!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on a whim not knowing what to expect. We were early and our children were welcomed. The service was wonderful and all of our dishes were amazing.  I felt like we were in Italy :-) we will be back!"}
{"text":"Overall, very pleased. Thank you, Yelpers!  Friendly, welcoming staff. Clean.  Nice presentation of garlic bread for starters. Lasagna and pollo parmigiana both prepared flawlessly. Nice portions. Nice plating.  Their black iced tea was pretty close to colored water.  Skip the \"homemade\" brownie dessert. Maybe their more traditional, Italian, desserts would be the way to go. The brownie was OK. It tasted very dry or maybe slightly overcooked. The chocolate sauce was Hershey's syrup. The ice cream was store-bought vanilla and it was freezer burnt.  This is a come-back-to place for me. Happy."}
{"text":"We stopped in Phoenix for a night along our road-trip to San Antonio, TX from California. I used Yelp to find a recommended Italian restaurant near our hotel in eastern Phoenix and found Adela's Italian restaurant.... and I'm really glad I did. The food was excellent and the atmosphere was casual and yet respectable. This is a small restaurant located in a small shopping \"strip-mall\" with plenty of parking. Service was great, prices were reasonable, and the food was really really good..... just what I wanted: good Italian \"home-cooked\" food! I had the Fettuccine Della Casa and my wife had the Meat Lasagna. wonderful food!"}
{"text":"Funny story how I ended up at this place. Everyone was (technically still) talking about Mora's and I was one of those fatties who was dying to try it as well. The parents suddenly wanted dinner, so I immediately jumped on the mooch train and thought that this was my one opportunity to go to Mora's with my broke behind. Plot Twist: Parents told me that I was paying because ... well, just because they said so.   So, with literally just an hour before dinner, I searched on Yelp nearby for a waaay cheaper Italian option because that's the kind of daughter I am. Adela's came up on my radar and I couldn't believe where it was because it's kind of in a sketchy plaza where I used go pick up my late night chicken wings/crack snack. Definitely don't remember it being there but it is tucked away in the corner so look twice.   This is a no frills mom and pop place. No fancy decor, no fancy bathroom and no fancy servers. It's a pretty small place, but when I got there the place had 3 large groups so I knew I had stumbled upon something great. My favorite Italian dish is Fettuccine Della Casa but I'm always hesitant to order it. A lot of places tend to treat it like it's alfredo. It's not supposed to feel as heavy and the sauce is supposed to be thinner and more delicate. I gave it a try here and oh mi Dio, I made out with that plate, no shame. Portion sizes are pretty hefty so it wasn't a pretty sight either. It was so creamy and the peas, mushroom and bacon help greatly to cut the never-ending carbs you're inhaling. If you're a starving human being, order the Chicken Parmesan. That chicken is as thick as a pork chop and covered most, if not all, the spaghetti under it. For the size of it, it was surprisingly juicy. We ordered a veal dish as well and I recommend you try it here if you've never tried this cut before. In no way was it dry nor rubbery like it usually is as it is one of the leanest cuts of beef, but doused in marsala and mushroom it evolves into a tender and indulgent meal not to be missed.   Let me tell you what a find this is. Not only did we happily waddle our way out with bellies so full it would have made Weight Watchers keel over and die, my wallet was doing a celebratory dance as well. Free table bread, 4 beers, 1 side salad, 3 big entrees, and 2 desserts: $80-something with tax included.   Honestly, I'm in no rush to try out Mora's anymore or any of the other hipster Italian places that keep popping up, no matter the hype. I'm quite content with this gem I found and I hope you will too. If you have the time, look up the story of the chef/owner and how this place came to be, it's pretty heart-warming to read."}
{"text":"Adela's is the best Italian food I have found. It's all homemade, flavorful, and plentiful. This is a nice intimate setting for date night. I don't think I have ever ordered off the menu, the specials are too tempting to pass up. Tonight I had the lobster ravioli that was topped with shrimp. It was, lick-your-plate delicious. My husband had the chicken parm and he is excited for his leftovers tomorrow. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was just what we needed. The table was in a corner but we did not have a reservation and we were ready to eat. I had the Chicken Limone it was delicious. My Wife went with Chicken Parm which was good as well. Definitely worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Adela's is a cute little restaurant hiding in the armpit of a strip mall. The husband and I went because I felt like lasagna, but the highlight ended up being his gnocchi. They bring tasty, thin sliced bread before the meal. My lasagna was good, but maybe not as good as it's price tag (over 15$). The husband's gnocchi in a pink sauce were amaaaazing. I would recommend that over the lasagna for sure. On top of that, we had to try the tiramisu. Their tiramisu was HUGE and tasty and we ate all of it because we are sick humans. This may not be my first choice for Italian in Phoenix, but I would come back."}
{"text":"Wow you cannot believe how beautiful this food is. It is honestly so delish from the outside one would never think that such fantastic food was possible.. The meal started with a simple house salad very fresh greens black berries and cherry tomatoes and a dressing so creamy and tasty it by itself would have been a success. The main course was absolutely dreamy if a person likes Italian they will love this place, it was just wonderful. The lemon chicken was terrific it disappeared quick. The other dish was chicken in a cream sauce with bacon and peas magic in the mouth! Finished with coffee and a chocolate brownie that was not ordinary by any standard. Great food great place wonderful service!"}
{"text":"The reviews were right. Food is good, like it came right from Roccie's Nona.  Very clean and comfortable atmosphere and very good service. Will repeat!"}
{"text":"This place is talked into a corner of a small strip mall. But don't let that stop you from stopping in. The service was great and very friendly. Lots of take out happening while we were there. Indoor and outdoor seating but was way too hot to sit outside. The food was very good as was the fresh bread. Just a great little place To spend an evening with the spouse while on vacation"}
{"text":"Great little place!  They made dishes not on the menu for me without any hesitation...  and it was good...."}
{"text":"Great find; we parked at The Doubletree and flew out ofSky Harbor then returned and the Doubletree bus driver recommended this place. It's  great find: nice menu, good fresh food , and friendly, attentive, and helpful service.  The portions are a nice size - not huge as is the case with many Italian restaurants.  We will certainly go back and recommend it to all."}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent dervice and homey atmosphere, so happy we found this gem in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"As an Italian I am pretty particular about my food. I was not disappointed by Adela's. Amazing food, friendly people, great atmosphere. The manicotti was very flavorful. The Alfredo was some of the creamiest I've ever had. Definitely save room for some tiramisu and cannolis. Good wine selection as well."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is incredible, so is the service! Very clean very warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"Found Adela's on YELP (Where else).  The wait staff was extremely friendly and efficient.  My date ordered the lasagna and I ordered the manicotti.  Both are traditional favorites that were prepared to perfection.  Will definitely stop here the next time in Phoenix 'nm"}
{"text":"Love this place, some of the best italian food i've had in Phoenix!  Legit everything:  fresh homemade bread, great friendly service (the owner is very nice), chicken marsala with fresh veggies awesome, gnocchi in vodka sauce wonderful, and very reasonably priced.  Was really surprised as I've been to a ton of italian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Well....this was another strange experience but 4 stars for the food. I just moved to this side of town so wanted to try a neighborhood joint. We walk in and an older lady greets us and seats us with no menus and walks away. Comes back and asks if we would like drinks and I order an iced t and my sister says water and maybe wine. She goes back inside (we sat outside) and grabs a wine list. Comes back and asks about apps. Leaves, comes back with my tea, asks about wine. Leaves, grabs menus, comes back with bread. Leaves, comes back to take order, leaves, comes back and says she forgot what we ordered. Brings soup, brings salad I never ordered, asks about wine again. Just back and forth and back and forth....I had told her it was my sister's bday but she just dropped off the check, didn't ask us for dessert (not asking for a free dessert but it was her bday, maybe she wanted dessert) which she did. We order dessert and coffee and it comes Togo. Why would it come in a box? So my sis says, can I eat it here? The young man that was a busser, I think, went and got it plated up. Coffee was lukewarm. When we went to pay, the young man asked us how much the tip was going to be so he could put it in the IPad. Just weird. Who does that? The food was very good though. The lasagna tasted like fresh pasta and had great flavor, the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and broccoli was amazing as well as the soup. Spinach and egg in a broth kinda soup. Dessert was tiramisu and cheesecake were both creamy and delicious. I really enjoyed the food. Maybe I'll just keep this place in mind for take out only."}
{"text":"Amazing food, yummy desserts, good drinks, reasonably priced! They have in door and outdoor seating. Love the decorations, and music (frank Sinatra) makes it feel authentic. Come here quiet often have tried many things but finally decided to review because I fell in love with their soup!"}
{"text":"I have been there 3 times and all three times we enjoyed ourselves. Delicious food, nice environment, good service. This is on my top list whenever i decide to bring my friend or family to somewhere."}
{"text":"What a treat! I visited on Saturday evening and was surprised to find no wait for a table. Every dish we enjoyed was fresh and super flavorful. We were well taken care of by the staff as well. This was an excellent find!"}
{"text":"Cute little place in a strip mall. Okay let's talk about the food....if you like Olive Garden or carrabas then this place is just right for you. This is not an authentic Italian restaurant. The red sauce is average and I'm being generous. The lasagna is less than good., stouffers frozen from grocery store is better. The veal Parmesan was again less than par. The service was okay and the staff was very nice but forgetful. Waiter said he wails bring bread and forgot. The wine list is very limited and selection is not vast or good. Overall, not sure if they had a bad night in the kitchen or people who rated this place 4/5 don't know Italian food. Do not recommend if you want true Italian cooking but for an average meal...go for it."}
{"text":"We went here for a Sunday day night at around 7:30 and it wasn't busy at all. The bread is absolutely amazing. The Caesar salad was perfect. And we had the gnocchi ala vodka which was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The service was amazing and we were in and out within 40 minutes. Highly recommend"}
