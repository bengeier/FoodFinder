{"text":"Very delicious lunch!  Michele, the owner, is a very accomplished young man and should be very proud of his establishment!  His Polish chef is very accomplished at preparing Italian dishes as well.  We enjoyed the outside dining and the very attentive service of Michele.  Two of the ladies in my group shared spaghetti and meatballs - a very large, tasty portion!  I had the Arancini balls in a blue cheese sauce that was delectable along with a nice salad.  We all shared the calamari which was some of the best we had ever had - a very light coating, cooked to perfection!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time to try their Big Taste supper menu. Nice ambience. Staff was friendly. Food was good but nothing to rave about. Our salmon was seasoned very well but the prime rib seemed a little under seasoned. Parking can be troublesome as they are in Kensington, they do have a small parking lot in front of the restaurant but it's shared with the AUCE sushi place beside it so it's usually full"}
