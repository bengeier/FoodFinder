{"text":"WAY WAY WAY too expensive.  Two glasses of wine and two Draft beers set me back 72 dollars before tip...  either that or they ripped me off.  
i live in London and Amsterdam and I've never seen anything this expensive in my life..."}
{"text":"This establishment has the worst service I've ever experienced. The server was inattentive and slow. We had a party of 7 and in the time it took for 3 individuals to go to the restroom (separately), the server visited all the tables around us except for us. From the time we decided that we wanted the bill and got up and asked to get the bill.. It was 15 minutes later. 

Upon being seated, we received menus which didn't include drink menus. When we asked for the drink menu, we received iPads which were heavy, slow and difficult to navigate. The drinks and food are over priced.

The washrooms were nice; however, one stall was out of order, two had no toilet paper and there were no paper towels in the washrooms."}
{"text":"Great bar staff, great servers.  Love the location, especially if you're going to a game or concert, or are in the area go to the CN Tower.  Decor and food are all really good.  The meatballs are fantastic and worth a trip by themselves."}
{"text":"Went there before a concert. They put my girlfriend and I in a corner, and no one noticed us sitting there until 20 minutes later. When our food came which was pretty quick, they didn't take our empty bread basket (our table was small so there was no room for our dinner and drinks). The food was pretty good but not the greatest especially for the price. I got the steak frites and my girlfriend got the halibut. Our waitress only came back when it was time to get the check. The service was terrible."}
{"text":"Went there last night after the Jays game for few drinks.  We sat at the bar and I had ordered an extra  dirty martini.  The bartender was a nice guy, but he couldn't get the drink quite right.  Had to have him adjust it 3 times to make it more dirty and even after the 3rd attempt I was like never mind, it's fine.  I had 3 drinks and was completely shocked at the $66 tab!  $22 for a vodka martini, are you kidding me?!!  Being from Boston, I'm no stranger to high prices, but give me a break Eleven.  If they jacked up the prices because of TIFF, then shame on you!  Next time I'm in Maple Leaf Sq, I'll be sure to keep walking!"}
{"text":"E11even is a trendy hangout in downtown Toronto with some serious food. The Cheeseburger at E11even is no exception and is amongst the best in Toronto. 

The burger is topped with classic ingredients with a little twist: maple bacon, shredded lettuce, relish, a house-made sauce, tomato, and cheese. Add in a well-seasoned, juicy, and perfectly cooked piece of beef all sandwich between a tender bun. The burger's creamy and rich flavor was well complemented by the maple bacon. The shredded lettuce and pickle relish made for a perfect texture. All of this combines to each being a perfect combination of ingredient distribution and flavor. The standout ingredient on the burger is the maple bacon, which is easily amongst the best on the planet. 

My only minor suggestion would be a little more salt/pickle/vinegar flavor that would have given this burger a perfect mouthwatering finish. It is not an 11 out of 10 but it is pretty close."}
{"text":"I went here again for appetizers and dessert a little while ago. The service was poor. We had to wait a long time before the hostess even noticed us, and the slow, inattentive service continued into our visit. The macaroni and cheese was sort of tasteless and the carrot cake took forever to come and tasted like it came from the fridge. None of the other menu items caught our eye. I would actively avoid going here again."}
{"text":"Restaurants in Toronto always dissappoint me in one way or another, however, my experience tonight at e11even was excellent!! 

Service: We were attended by a lovely girl called Dawn who was not only a sweet and freindly face but helped us with recommendations and managed our loud and demanding table of 13! All the other servers were freindly as well. Quite unusual service for Toronto. 

Food: From the bread that they bring complimentary (to die for!) to our appetisers and entrees; everything was amazing. On our table we had ordered oysters, the burgers (which everyone loved), the mac n cheese, ribs, hot dog... we were all genuinely surprised!

Ambience: Not too loud, sports bar ambience with an elegant flair. 

HIGHLIGHT: THE WASHROOMS!!! WOW. Not only is it lavished with gorgeous marble, the ladies washrooms have an electronic biday!! Im talking full cleansing options - anddd the seats were heated!! SO awesome!! 

Loved it! It is quite a pricey place, so be prepared to dishout a bit of $$$ but well worth the experience."}
{"text":"I agree with earlier posts, a bit pricey, but the food is good and the service excellent. I'll go back for a proper dining experience. This time around, i had the cheeseburger and coleslaw on the side. No comments."}
{"text":"Awful service and terrible value for food. 


Avoid at all costs. 


Many other places near the acc you can go to for a pre game meal. Unless you want over priced food, slow service and union workers not helping you go there."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times. Food's great and the wait staff have always been good. I recommend getting one of the burgers (they're all good) and the crab cake"}
{"text":"food was pretty ok - nothing spectacular or outstanding, but the prices were definitely spectacular! I ordered Roast chicken with mashed potatoes - presentation was good, taste - decent  ! My boyfriend ordered BBQ ribs which he could not stop raving about. He said his meal was fantastic . Portions were very good . For two of us with one drink + main course each + tax and tip it cost almost $ 50 bucks a head. Its a hip place to hang out, but food is your average american food and one is paying the price for its fancy toilets, ipads (only for drinks - what a waste, I can understand if the entire menu is on it - just another way to show off ) & central location downtown."}
{"text":"Dining at E11even can be a real hit or miss experience.  When the kitchen is on top of their game the execution and quality of the food is great.  However more often than not the dishes are lackluster and not worth the sticker price of the menu.  I have had great meals, notably a juicy cheeseburger and the Lobster Cobb Salad but have seen the flip side and left disappointed after a \"daily special\" Tuna steak sandwich as well as a rubbery under-seasoned steak frites.  

 

The Lobster Cobb, while at first deemed daunting by its $34 price tag, is well worth it when it arrives in a large bowl filled with crispy pancetta, fresh croutons, and of course and entire steamed lobster.  If I was ever going to pay over $30 for a salad, I was glad this was it.  

As for their cheeseburger, E11even follows a recent trend of using a fatty and flavourful cut of meat to fill their bun, and letting the quality, not quantity, of their toppings and ingredients do the talking. And this move pays off with one of the better \"sit down\" burgers in the city.  I'd definitely stick to this on any future visits.
 

However not everything can be raved about. The tuna burger I had was dry and quite bland. It tasted like it had been frozen and thawed, although the server claimed it was a fresh cut. The Steak Frites also had a rubbery texture and likely was not a quality cut of beef.  


Overall E11even is worthy as a first venture into the restaurant business for MLSE, however it often seems over priced for the quality of meals you'll get."}
{"text":"Good service and atmosphere. Good seafood, didn't try anything else or the drinks but their wine rack is an impressive engineering feat. They have well trained waitress and servers. The bread is hot and buttered but it's not fresh made after peaking into the kitchen. They have loads of them in plastic bags."}
{"text":"I've been so excited to check out this restaurant. I've heard good things about the food, and as a Nutritionist I'm always on the hunt for good spots that I can recommend. 

I walked in with a girlfriend of mine and the restaurant was full (it was an event night at the ACC). There were about 5 people waiting by the front podium, who had clearly been talked to already and were just waiting for a table to open up. 

We approached the podium where the hostess was standing and waited to be greeted. Well, we were left waiting without even so much as a hello. In fact, the hostess didn't even look up once. Finally, after 10 minutes my friend said 'Hi' to the hostess and the hostess said 'Hi' back and put her head right back down. Within the minute, another hostess or manager came up to the front and my friend asked about the wait. They said they would have nothing come up until 9pm (it was 715pm at this time)... thanks for the heads up and wasting our time. No offer at all to try and accommodate or at least the effort to make us feel like we weren't a nuisance to them.  

I worked at the busiest restaurant on Front Street (and in Canada at one point), and have seen our front area full with 50+ people and the hostesses would still hit every greet AND would make a WAIT LIST. Hence, they would greet people right away and put them on the wait list so at least the guest would know they were noticed and welcome. Apparently a full restaurant and 5 people in the front was too much for e11even to handle. 

Totally blown away by such lack of professionalism and ownership of this restaurant. 

We called one of the other restaurants close by who said they would gladly figure something out for us. We went, it was packed, and there was a wait, but they got us in and we made it to the show on time!"}
{"text":"I have been to E11even many times, ranging from business dinners to the occasional date (yep, while they all later sipped from the glass of regret, some women actually did spend time me). Below are my thoughts.

Ambiance: 7.5/10
It's decent, but there is nothing overly rememberable about it. The giant, angled mirror above the bar is a nice touch, as one doesn't feel cut off from the rest of the venue while sitting in a bar stool. And if you happen to be a business traveller who is staying at the hotel next door and you've grown tired of checking your email on your phone for the umpteenth time, you can creep the front door without appearing to be, um, well, creepy.

Bathrooms: 9/10
Always clean. The only reason that they don't score higher is because the lighting is a little dark, making it difficult to ensure that after your meal your teeth aren't sporting a chunk of that vile weed called broccoli. Oh, and the water pressure from the taps cause the Toronto Fire Department to feel envy. Soaking. Me. Every. Single. Time.

Food Quality: 9/10
I've never been disappointed, and this is despite them removing my favourite dish from the menu. Burgers are excellent, as is the chicken. I've never ordered their dessert, for no other reason than my doctor has asked me to start watching my height.

Drink Quality: 9/10
A great selection of mid-to-high quality beverages, with generous pours by the staff. Their least expensive drink is, well, probably tap water (complimentary!), and their steepest shot is a bank account draining $1,300. Yeah, I didn't mistype that, it's $1,300. So, two shots of this stuff is the equivalent of a lease payment on a Porsche 911, or a week at an all-inclusive resort on a communist island in the Caribbean. Seems reasonable. Right?

(Side note: while I didn't witness it, apparently a gentleman ordered two shots of this liquid gold - and proceeded to pour them directly into his DIET COKE. Yep. True story. Which is kinda like getting the world's hottest hooker and keeping the lights off - twice)

Service: 10/10
This is where E11even really shines. Their service is superb. The staff is friendly, yet very professional. On bar, request Dre, he's dynamite (ask him about the nickname 'Clock' while you are waiting for your drinks to arrive - it's a great story, guaranteed that you will laugh and remember it forever). Dylan is also phenomenal, and a very interesting guy, don't let the hair throw you, this kid is going places. On the floor, ask for Serena or Ali, neither will disappoint with their charm or level of professionalism.

Crowd: 8/10
The slightly higher prices tend to keep the peasants away (they find comfort in the confines of the nearby plethora of sports bars), which makes for a better overall dining experience. The people are generally classy and well-behaved. Sometimes, before or after big events, such as a concert or a hockey game, the bar area can become a bit crowded, but overall, everyone in the restaurant is decent.

Patio: 8/10
The patio boasts a west exposure, which means sunlight throughout the late afternoon and evening. Also, because it is so far removed from the street, and they have created an organic barrier of various shrubbery, one does not notice the cars on the road as they typically would on a downtown, street-level patio, which is nice. Also, no bugs. Yeah, big plus. Bees are important to our ecosystem, but eating without the constant threat of being stung resonates well with me.

Parking: 6/10
There's lots of it, but you are in the core, so be prepared to pay. The least expensive that is in close proximity of the restaurant is immediately west of York Street, on the south side of Bremner Avenue. 

Overall: 9/10
You will not find anything better in the area at the same price point as E11even. Yes, it is slightly more expensive than most of the restaurants on Front Street (which largely consist of your standard big chain venues that plague movie theatre and mall parking lots in the 905 area), but in this case, you truly get what you pay for in terms of quality and service. 

And, yes, I use a lot of commas."}
{"text":"I went to this place for a business dinner. The ambiance at this place is fairly nice...modern, chic, trendy...but nothing really outstanding.

The wait staff is fairly attentive and proudly presenting you with ipads with the wine list.

I ordered the prime rib but it was not as good as the prime rib at the Keg. The thing to order here appears to be the sirloin cheese burger.

It was a new place so worth trying but not sure that I would really go back. 

There was nothing distinct or amazing about my experience there.  I can't recall much about the service or the food.  

The only thing that I now recall is that the washrooms for women have all these buttons in the bathroom stall. I was asked by the men i was with to go check it out but none of the functions appeared to be working when I was there to take a look. I just snapped a pic since this was requested...it appeared to be perhaps some Japanese made toilet....???"}
{"text":"Now if you have to remember one Yelp review about this restaurant (and I use this term loosely), hopefully it's going to be mine. 

As a guest at Le Germain, I thought it'd be a good idea to grab dinner at e11even, given that Le Germain usually teams up with renowned restaurateurs - the Montreal Germain is home to the Laurie Raphaël, one of the country's top restaurants. Boy was I disappointed...

Long story short, the service was very poor (the two waitresses were just casually chatting at the bar, fixing their hair and whatnot), their meals are insanely overpriced (25$ for a cheeseburger? 24$ for linguine? Come on!), the ambiance is horrible, and I could go on. 

Turns up it amounted to 33$ for a glass of wine and a Caesar's salad drenched in dressing, no bacon, for which I left 5$ in tip - not exactly 15%, but I didn't get exactly a memorable experience. It probably was not enough for the waitress, because I just saw today that they charged me 41$. 

For salad and a glass of wine."}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5! Service, atmosphere and food is great!! But $25 burger is overpriced in my opinion! Similar to Bymark. $$$"}
{"text":"I cannot fathom the high ratings this restaurant has unless people were more impressed with the ridiculous prices.  I recently went for lunch with two friends.  Two had the lobster roll and one had the lobster salad- $35 for lunch entree!  The lobster roll was mostly lettuce with a small amount of watery tasteless lobster, Luke warm fries and a tiny pot of watery coleslaw.  Terribly disappointing.  Total bill without any alcohol - just tap water and two coffees came to $130.  For lunch!  Give this one a pass.  There are so many excellent places to eat in Toronto."}
{"text":"Our party scheduled a reservation for news years eve the day before. We originally scheduled it for 6:30 p.m. However, we had a family member playing a hockey game @3:30 on New Year's Eve. We knew we would be late so we called the restaurant and they said we have a 15 min. Grace period. So we arrived at 6:44 (1 min to spare) and they said we lost our reservation and the hostess table was extremely unprofessional and laughing and blaming it on us and was just being straight up rude. However the server was fantastic. After seeing this review we received an email with an apology and we appreciated it greatly."}
{"text":"This place gets 6 stars for service as we had an exceptional server at lunch time. Turns out we're both from New Jersey and he even knew the small town where I grew up! The food though... Meh, not horrible but not fantastic especially or the price. I had a so-so lobster roll that came with oily, over cooked french fry crumbs. I would never have picked this place except I was someone else's guest because it is very pricey and the food is just ok. The service however was excellent."}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of friends for late lunch. We were pretty much the only people dining there at that time. The place was nicely decorated. Their food taste good, but not up to par for what they're priced. We sampled pretty much everything from their $11 summer menu. None of the food we tried really stood out.  Friendly servers and bartender, good atmosphere. Would like to come back and try some food from their regular menu."}
{"text":"It was dusty and the food was terrible. There are much better restaurants nearby for the same $!"}
{"text":"The great ambience aside (especially the outdoor patio), if you're looking for a place for great American bar and grill food, this place hits the spot. The lamb burger was medium rare, although the buns weren't toasted, it was still amazing. The linguini was delicious, you could really taste the basil and sauce, it was just the right amount of chewy and seasoning. 

Although a little pricier, the crab cake was also a highlight as an appetizer. Overall you get what you're paying for both in food and service, our waiter was attentive and that helped a lot as we were in a bit of a rush. Thankfully, the food came quickly and was definitely fresh.

I would definitely return here when I'm in the mood to treat myself or for a nice celebratory meal!"}
{"text":"Kind of overpriced for what they offer. Got a seat on the sofa portion of the outside patio and had to keep moving to let the waiter walk by so she could squeeze by and check up on the people on the sofa beside us. We had a view of the Air Canada Centre big screen, so I guess that's something that could be taken advantage of when there's a game on."}
{"text":"Catch of the day....excellent one of the top 10 dinners I have ever had. Great waitress, friendly, clean and not to loud, you could easily carry on a conversation over dinner."}
{"text":"When it first opened I tried their Valentines menu and I was disappointed.  At that time the only thing I liked was the bathroom.  Decided to give it a try two years later and the food was delicious and so were the cocktails.  
Shrimp cocktail - huge shrimp 
Ravioli - Good 
Lobster Mac and Cheese - Delicious big chunks of lobster 
Tuna tartar - Delicious 
The staff was very nice and polite.  The bathroom this time was very disappointing it did not smell good and was not clean.  Overall I had a better experience the second time.  I will be back in the summer"}
{"text":"The food was okay but the ambience outside was really nice. They have heaters on their patio so you can use the patio comfortably. Not the best burger or ribs I've had but the service was good and I really enjoyed the patio."}
{"text":"Went here last night. Very nice place, awesome look. Very pricey for what they offer ($17 hot dog!!!!!!!!!). 

The food was good but nothing to rush back to again on my next trip to Toronto. BBQ ribs with crushed peanuts on top? Peanuts? Really? $29 for a rack and they put peanuts????????? Macadamia, walnuts, pecans....

BIG disappointment was ordering a$85 of bottle of wine and them not having it even though they only opened about 3 weeks ago. Two and a half thumbs down.

Overall, nice place to go for a drink and an appetizer to impress someone but other than that, Danforth Greek restos, here I come."}
{"text":"I don't think this place is worth the price. I think the food is good, the ambience is good. But that's it. It's just good. I don't think it's worth $50 for ordering a burger and drink. If it was at a lower price point I would go more often. 

It's ina great location but there are lots of other options. The staff were really nice though."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, I choose to eat at E11even over all of the other restaurants in the city because I work in the same building. That being said, it is a decent dining experience.

The first time I went was for burger week in 2013. They had Nonna's Burger which was their amazing giant meatball appetizer on a soft bun with Parmesan cheese. This was one of only a couple \"high end\" burgers that chose to charge more than the five buck burger week price. This was not necessarily warranted since it was on par with other burgers on the list. Also, it was kind of a cop out since they already serve the meatballs. I feel the bun actually took away from the meatball and it would have been better on its own. Add on a side of $10 Truffled Parmesan Fries and you feel like you got ripped off.

My second experience was much better since it was just a nice lunch with my cousin. I ordered the Nova Scotia Lobster Roll and it was amazing. Lobster is stuffed into a soft buttered bun and sided with crispy frites and an appley coleslaw. Definitely worth the $27 because of the abundance of lobster - not sure I can say the same for my cousin's Tandoori Chicken Sandwich at $16. 

Service at E11even is very good. Servers are polite and attentive in the way that you would expect them to be in a high end restaurant. My main concern with E11even is that it seems to be having an identity crisis. Is it a casual spot or is it a high end restaurant? The casual vibe comes from the menu of burgers, salads and sandwiches (even a hot dog). The noise level is loud and there are communal tables in the main dining room and couches on the patio. The high end feeling comes from the focus on customer service and the high prices!! 

Basically, if you can overlook that you shelled out some coin for what most people would consider bar food, you will enjoy E11even."}
{"text":"We had dinner on the patio, with a nice view of the CN tower in its lighted night time glory. This is a good place to go with a group, and the service was great.   Our waitress was particularly attentive.  We were there celebrating several birthdays.  The waitress brought shots for everyone at the end of the meal, and having noticed that I don't drink prepared something non-alcoholic for me, unasked.  

Otherwise, it is your typical unspectacular American cuisine, comparable to Jack Astors.  

The seared tuna salad entree wasn't bad, although the salad was drowning in the dressing.

The lobster rolls were more akin to a fast food type of plate, with pieces of lobster stuffed in a hot dog bun and served with fries.

The baby back ribs were actually very tasty and my favourite of the dishes.  The truffles mac n cheese also gets a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Very good. Excellent bartender (had dinner seated at the bar) and the smoked salmon appy was really, really good. Not overly expensive for the location etc. I recommend!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here for a glass of wine, but did not eat. They have a nice selection of wines by the glass, but quite pricey. I paid $20 for a glass of a bottle worth $28. The ambiance is nice, it is an upscale place, but be ready for the bill at the end ...  The staff were knowledgeable about wine and quite friendly. I'd go back to check it out again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  Great atmosphere in the patio, bar and dining areas.  Food is fantastic!  The Lobster roll and Maple burger are my faves!"}
{"text":"Used to like this place. I really did. Now I would advise you to steer clear. Overpriced is an understatement. I would recommend going a bit north of Front St and far away from this place. The food used to be good but is now mediocre at best. Don't even get me started on drinks...$10 for a single shot vodka? $8 to add Red Bull?? Sorry guys you need to rethink your \"we're the place to be\" prices because you're nowhere near. Two drinks, an appetizer and a main with tax and reasonable tip = $100. I'm not even kidding. Save your money. Oysters are the smallest I've ever seen with no flavour and will run you $20 for a measly half dozen!

I really believe they're banking on getting the overflow from Real Sports but if you're reading this, do yourself a favour and look elsewhere. The service is awful and there is no atmosphere - certainly nothing that would justify the ridiculous prices.

If you are looking for a place to stop in the area for some food and drink there's a ton of other places like the Esplanade with better prices, service and experience. This is nothing more than a drab, overpriced, pretentious tourist trap."}
{"text":"$12 for a pint of beer? Prices for beer not on menu and no notice was given by the server. Nice surprise when the bill came, especially after having a pretty damn tasty burger. Sorry, as someone who loves beer, not going back based on that. I can get a good burger at lots of more affordable places in Toronto."}
{"text":"The service was wonderfully accommodating and attentive from the minutes we arrived, made sure we had everything we needed at all times, including full glasses of wine and water.

They have absolutely delicious food here! There's a bacon appetizer that will make you see it in a whole different light, and as a result, I'm not sure I can ever eat a piece of regular, plain bacon again. Among their specials that night were scallops, which I couldn't resist. And they were amazing. 

You will not regret indulging during a visit to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Just finished eating at this restaurant 20 minutes ago and I wanted to write my experience here as it is fresh in my memory. It's the raptors game tonight and a friend and I wanted to visit a bar to watch the game and this one was close in proximity.. Upon arrival, they were able to seat us right away which was a good start, but then things got really messed up. We were sitting at our table for about 15 minutes until the hostess came over to us to let us know their \"policy\" we had to spend a minimum of $20 each to sit in the lounge. This was strange because we hadn't even met our waitress yet or decided what we wanted to eat, so already our options felt restricted. I told the hostess, \"That's fine, could you bring us our waitress so we can get drinks first at least?\" And she said okay. Our waitress came, she was friendly, then things started to look up again.. Until I ordered the food. I ordered a cheeseburger because I thought that would be safe to get at a restaurant that I had never tried before.. and boy was I wrong! The cheeseburger was very bland and accompanied with french fries that were way too burnt to be edible. But that wasn't even the worst part .. In the middle of me eating, the waitress came and said we had to pay for our meal right then. In the middle of me eating! Who does that. I politely responded, I'll ask for the bill when we're finished eating and she nodded then walked away. As I was trying to eat the rest of this $35 meal, she came over, slapped the bill on the table and then walked off.. I was stunned. I have never been treated like this in a restaurant before and couldn't help but wondered if it was because of what we looked like. Our neighbours sitting next to us were able to relax, eat and enjoy the game. Why couldn't we? I'm very upset with the experience I had here and will not be dining here again."}
{"text":"They have a $25 hamburger. Was it worth it? Every goddamn penny. 

The only down side is that the prices are a little high. Great place tho!"}
{"text":"I like being outside. We sat on the patio. It was nice.

The prices aren't nice. They're a little silly. My burger was 25 dollars. It was fancy. It was a maple burger, with Guinness cheddar cheese. It was pretty decent, i wasn't a huge fan of the maple flavor but that's okay. The cheese was unique looking but just tasted like cheddar. The bacon was the most remarkable part. It was as thick as my thumb, and tasty. Nice big slabs. 

The service was alright. Friendly, fairly quick. I left her a crappy tip even though she was fine, just because the place was so expensive. Sorry! I'm not really sorry. 

Try it if you want to impress people or think that you're really special!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to dine at e11even while I was at a conference this summer in Toronto.  It was a lunch meeting with clients and ended up being a perfect setting to discuss business over a nice meal.  

First off, their decor is right up my alley.  It's sexy, dark, and modern with clean lines throughout the restaurant.  To start off, our waiter brought over an iPAD that housed the drink menu.  Being a technology enthusiast, it was pretty cool and definitely a unique experience.  From there we jumped right in to ordering our meal.

The service was solid throughout the meal.  The food was delicious and received high marks from everyone at the table.  We started off with crab cakes that were delicious.  I ordered the skirt steak salad and it was on point as well.  The meal was covered by my customers so that may have played into my overall experience.  I don't have anything negative to say about e11even.  In fact, I'll return if I'm ever back in Toronto.  However, looking back... I don't know if I would have ever paid $26 for a salad if it were coming out of my own pockets."}
{"text":"Back in another life, when I used to do PR and would meet with a contact who worked at the nearby Telus building, E11even was my favorite choice for meetings, as well as the site of a couple of amazing Toronto International Film Festival parties I attended.

The best scallops I ever had in my life came from here - was at a party and they had baskets full of these king scallops. The organizers must have spent thousands on them, and they were melt-in-your-mouth delicious.

The food has always been a bit overpriced, but it's Toronto. You didn't just come here for a burger. The atmosphere and design is quite nice, volume levels are low enough that you can talk with someone easily, and there's a very laid-back vibe to the whole restaurant.

Definitely a classy place, and one of the best restaurants I've been to in the south end of the city. 

Very recommended!"}
{"text":"A very nice fancy high end restaurant to have a nice expensive meal.

The restaurant is quite nice, very big and dimly lit with good seats. The servers are good and service is top notch. The customer service is justifies the high prices.

They started us off with their bread and butter and the bread was to die for. I ordered Swordfish, it was a big piece the fish cooked to perfection with sauce on the side as well as rice. The fish was nice and soft to eat and would melt in your mouth. The entire dish was splendid and I loved it. The food came warm and with reasonable time.

The washrooms are designed very nice with art display and were clean."}
{"text":"This was the night of the Lady Antebellum concert and Real Sports Bar had a waiting list (as usual). My boyfriend told me to check E11even to see if there were any spots for 4, and wow, I was seated immediately! 

Wine menu on an Ipad. Modern. 

We had the Tuna Flatbread to start with and I would have preferred the bread to be much crispier. For my main, I had the lobster roll which was really yummy: buttery, soft bread with chunky pieces of lobster and really yummy fries. I think I have found my dish.

The only gripe I have with this place is that the food prices here are really expensive, for what they are. This seems to be a restaurant where you go when all other places are full. Fancy, but not quite; food is good, but not worth the price you're paying for; not quite casual, but actually fancier. A hodgepodge place.

Don't think I will be going back here anytime soon, but for those who can't get a seat at Real Sports, try E11even as your alternative."}
{"text":"A bit pricey ($34 for salmon) but excellent quality and friendly service.  My husband and I met here for lunch. We had the grilled calamari to start (cooked perfectly tender and generous portion for an app; perfect for sharing) and then the special: broiled red snapper with romanesco salad and butternut purée ($34). 

The snapper was, again, cooked perfectly (my fork went through it like butter) and the romanesco salad was the perfect accompaniment. The textures and flavours of the snapper, romanesco with freshly toasted almond slivers and just-sweet raisins came together perfectly with the buttery squash purée  (maybe a touch too buttery).

Atmosphere: Pretty much what you would expect from a resto in the south financial district but lighting was too dark! Felt like dinner rather than lunch.

Overall: a nice spot for a delicious (but pricey) lunch.  1 app + 2 lunch specials + 1 lrg bottle evian = ~$100 (incl. tax) + tip"}
{"text":"We came here with a voucher for my wife's birthday brunch, and this is a great example of voucher gone RIGHT.  Yup, my form of romance is taking my wife out for brunch with a voucher.  This is how to reel 'em in, boys.

Service here was a touch slow, I'm guessing because it was the last day of the voucher.  But, she was very nice & accomodating.

Food: Incredible.  We had a bread platter to start... I think this is the best bread/pastry I've had in the city.  The only rival is Edulis, but that's more plain and this is richer.

Our server reco'd the maple burger and steak & eggs.  Both were incredible.

Nice decor too.  We will be back.  WOW."}
{"text":"If it's a game night at they Air Canada Centre you'll probably need a reservation but otherwise it's relatively easy to get a table.

It's clean and the staff are generally quite professional.  They sometimes seem a little pushy with the drink menu.  For example tonight I said no thank you to them placing it on the table (it's an iPad) and I had to request it twice.  Not a big deal, but if I don't want a drink, I don't want a drink.

Steak Frites was excellent.  Ordered it rare and it can out perfect.  The fries were good, but the waitress forgot to upswell me on the truffle Parmesan topping (and I didn't remember to order it - it's not on the menu). If you get the fries, don't forget the topping."}
{"text":"They wipe the tables with a dirty old rag, against food service regulations, repulsive.

Food took forever to arrive, and brought someone else's first. Quality and presentation were good, too salty though. Fill the plate with huge amount of fries to visually make the meal look large. Waaaay over priced. Service fairly good."}
{"text":"We came for a friends birthday bash on a Saturday with reservations and I would recommend making reservations in advance on weekends as the place was slammed. After the Leafs game was over it got ridiculous especially the bar area as one could hardly walk around there.
This is not a intimate place as they play the music loud and coupled with the crowd it was insane. 
My friends ordered the roast chicken and lobster roll. I just ordered a glass of an Aussie Shiraz. The service was excellent and we were checked on regularly. I like the idea that one can browse through their somewhat decent wine/drinks list on iPads. 
There is a good sized cellar with some impressive vintages on display.
The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time according to the friends though not  exceptional and was decent and fulfilling. 
Since we were in a celebration mood we ordered a bottle of bubbly unfortunately our first two choices were not available (I think having your drinks menu on iPad should make it dynamic) so we ended up with bottle of prosecco. 
We were given a free dessert with a candle for the birthday girl. It was an ice cream scoop on a brownie quite decadent
Wanted to a indulge we ordered a couple of hot fudge sundaes. The ice cream was good the and the dessert was rich with nice liquid chocolate to top it off.
I think its better suited for a bigger crowd or people wanting to nosh and enjoy a drink or two. 
They have spared no expense and apparently the ladies washrooms have the high end Japanese seats. Men's room were unfortunately not clean.
The setup is modern and quite dark so it might or might not be to everyone's liking. Full marks for Service as the server went beyond necessary to help out one person in our party.  The bill comes in a aptly named envelope \"The Damage\"
A solid 3.5 stars for a place to drink and socialize. Will hold the verdict for food till I have tried some."}
{"text":"The service was incredible slow. Took over an hour for our food to be served, which was a sandwich and a salad. 

The food itself was not good. The chicken in the chicken salad was cold cuts and the chicken in the chicken sandwich was burned. The sandwich and fries arrived cold as well. 

Overall this restaurant is over priced for the quality of food and service you receive."}
{"text":"Great food. Amazing staff. 
Found this place by accident. Bartendress recommended a Caribbean old fashion. Never heard of it - but thoroughly enjoyed it. I ordered the crab cake, expecting to be disappointed, as I grew up on the Pacific Ocean and have been spoiled with great seafood. I was impressed! 
I returned for lunch the following day. So glad I did! I ordered the tuna salad. It was seared to perfection. I added jalapeños on the side. 
Service was great both visits. 
If I were a local - this would be my spot"}
{"text":"Although I had heard lots of great things about this place, I was a little disappointed. The menu (which I should have checked prior) had very limited and very basic options. I had not come there expecting burgers and fries on the menus. U myself ordered the ribs which I was promised was soft enough to tear with a fork. Not quite. And my boyfriend ordered a steak which was actually very soft and delicious. They have their wine menu on an ipad but it made thing unnecessarily complicated. The drink portions were not worth their price and they gave u the most minimum amount. The service was great and when the table next to us complained about wine prices they gave them a glass on the house. The atmosphere was nice and the bathrooms had fun toilet technology haha. It's a little on the pricey side but what \"high class\" Resturant down  town isn't."}
{"text":"For a nicer restaurant, I really enjoyed this place. Their drinks were really good - I had the aged bourbon Old Fashioned. We had a number of appetizers including the platinum hot dog and oysters (opposite spectrum, eh?). The hot dog was surprisingly super good and the oysters were fun because we had a chance to compare East Coast and West Coast (WC all the way!!). 

For dinner, I had the filet mignon with the truffle mac n cheese. The filet was perfectly seasoned and prepared exactly to my liking. The mac n cheese is a hard thing to say no to and when you had truffle it's off the charts."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. it is a pretty decent, towards high end restaurant. it is pricey. 

We ordered appetizers. which were all good. The server came back saying the chef is not liking how the crab cakes are turning out so he doesnt wanna serve them. Made me feel great about the quality concious attitude. We ordered the ricotta, it was a hit among everyone at the table. the smoked salmon, was very different from yoru run of the mill sliced cold cut. it was a fillet and was amazing.
The steaks, ordered by my guests from out of town, were great. I had a bite and it was worth the $50.
@monica. the mac and cheese is really good. you have to be into truffle taste to like it. Gotta try the cheesecake. 
One of the guests in our party said it was one of the best burgers he ever had. The Hot dog was also delicious. 
We already had plans to go elsewhere for dessert.

Second time around, I had the Prime rib. Not the greatest steak i have had. one of the people in our party, had the salmon and declared it one of the best salmon he ever had.

Service was good both times.

My recommendation is: Must try!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and very modern. I like the open kitchen and selection of meats in the menu. This is definitely a special occasion restaurant but isn't very vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"Came here before the leafs game with a friend. Service was horrible and a times very rude; gave us the bill as we were eating, didn't bring our order of appetizers, took to long to even take are order. Food was pretty good. I had the fork and knife ribs, substituted the fries for truffled Mac & cheese (pretty good). My friend had the lobster roll he said the lobster itself was tasty but the way it was made out to eat was inconvenient.

My rating would be higher if the service was even the slightest bit better. O well, I'm sure there will be others who will support this place."}
{"text":"Very tall beers and excellent waitress.  Truffle fries are excellent. Maple burger was good but the bun was not good. Too bready. Takes away from the burger deliciousness. Amazing bacon on the maple burger.  Bun just takes too much away. Get a new bun!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and surely over hyped. The meal I had was just OK. I've had much better and it was not worth the exorbitant price. Service was also just OK. I wouldn't go back here willingly; there are much better options downtown."}
{"text":"Overpriced Menu $26 for burger.  Ordered margarita and was asked three times on how I'd like it made.   I specified each time the fresh squeezed lime was fine.  They suggested mixing it with lemonade and again, I told them the fresh lime was how I wanted my drink made.   After ten minutes of waiting the drink was finally made and I watched a fellow bartender drink from my drink.  He also allowed a customer sitting at the bar to try the drink.  Then the server took the drinks to us.  At which point we walked out.   Don't waste your time.  There's plenty of other places in the area."}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere seemed pretty fancy, we always assumed food would be over priced, and in some ways we were right, the \"colossal shrimps\" for the shrimp cocktail were $10 each, not nearly big enough to pay that price. But the main course was actually quite good, I ordered the 10oz steak, cooked perfectly at medium rare and went really well with their chimichuri sauce. Service was quite friendly too...oh and we really loved the free bread!"}
{"text":"An outstanding restaurant close to the harbor area.  We greatly enjoyed dinner here and considered it a cut above our other Toronto dining experiences. The menu offered a variety of selections, including steak, seafood and other dishes.  The tuna tartare and lobster macaroni & cheese were a big hit.  Service and the food was superb."}
{"text":"Be prepared to shell out some dough for this meal -- or expense it if you're able. 

Best dishes:
Crab cakes
Double-cut bacon
Baby-back ribs
Turkey BLT

And I hear the women's restroom is worth a visit."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend one night and got the seared ahi tuna salad.  It was pretty good.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere and our waitress was great.  She explained all the specials and the meals.  The BEST part about this restaurant is the warm bread you get before your meals.  Its warm and so good.  The butter is soft as well, not that hard butter.  I would recommend trying e11even!"}
{"text":"First time here and was very impressed. We were in a private dinning room. The service was top notch and the food fabulous. One of the Best Fillet mignon I've ever had. Cooked perfectly and second to none quality."}
{"text":"Nice space. Great service. Food was a bit less than mediocre. 

My steak seemed like it was marinated on the spot and that seasoning was short. Ordered medium rare...and it wasn't cooked right. Had to get it heated again.

It's a one and done for me- as nothing stood out about the taste."}
{"text":"This place is way too expensive for what you get in return. I paid 40$ for lamb shanks and I felt ripped off because it was average"}
{"text":"I'm a woman who has been disappointed by them many times. Sometimes I meet them at a party. Sometimes they catch my eye at a nice restaurant. Occasionally I even spot them at the supermarket and bring them back to my place (!). They sound good, they look good. The problem is that once I put them in my mouth, it's kind of a letdown...what, you've never had a bad crabcake? Did I not say \"crabcake\"?

People, here's a tip: It's at e11even. It swims in mustard remoulade. It lasts 2 heavenly minutes and costs $21, which is too much.

Follow that up with Tuna Tartare ($19), chilled, flavourful and snuggled in spicy aioli; then Deviled Eggs ($7 for 4 halves), which will have you imagining Chef Graham Pelley as everyone's favourite person to invite to a Midwestern church potluck.

I was already stuffed at this point in my meal, but you know, [insert cliché here that might justify why I kept eating despite being almost uncomfortably full]. Washing it all down with my delicious and spicy Dark and Stormy ($12), I carried on.

The Speckled Trout with fingerling potatoes and green beans ($33) was tender and doused in truffle butter with enough to share, but the side greens were too meagre for my carb-stuffed liking. I also tried the Lobster Roll ($27) which was quite tasty, as was the side of stringy fries - I would have eaten more of it but by now I was so full, I didn't think I'd make it to the Raptors game.

Highlight: the BREAD. Sweet, salty, soft, warm, buttery, everything. EVERYTHING.

Other highlight: the BIDETS. Well *that's* something you don't see at Sneaky Dee's. I didn't try them, seeing as I'm not a raging sociopath, but I would love to meet the person who, mid-dinner date, goes to the bathroom and decides to go the extra mile of freshness while other people are waiting around outside. Or maybe I wouldn't, I don't know.

In summation: 3.5 stars, rounded up for ordering drinks via tablet for no particular reason. Totally overpriced, but the food is good, service is good, and the derrières around you may or may not be especially refreshed. This glorified sports bar is a welcome alternative to the standard pre-/post-Air Canada Centre fare if you have money to blow and can't stomach Jack Astor's...and you want a really good $21 crab cake."}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Food was below average.  Ordered the fish taco daily special.  Food arrived fairly quickly. Wasn't as tasty as I expected."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend just before attending a concert. Although I had made a reservation, we still had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated. The large restaurant was dimly lit, loud, and bustling with people. 

We were served delicious complimentary bread. My friend ordered the lobster roll and liked it. I had the maple burger and it looked a lot better than it tasted. I couldn't really taste the garlic aioli that accompanied it. The fries were also nothing special. Portions here are huge, so you should definitely come hungry. 

Service was just alright."}
{"text":"Say goodbye to bad food at sports bars and tradition sports memorabilia decor. E11even takes the sports bar to a new level and the design of the dining room says it loud and clear. The restaurant opens up to a multi-screen lounge area followed by a large dining room that's surprisingly intimate, possibly due to the combination of modern design and a layout that is carved into smaller cosy areas.  

We've been to this restaurant 3 or 4 times now and service was prompt and attentive each time. A fantastic wine list presented on an iPad is a nice touch, supported by an extremely knowledgable Sommelier.

Some rave about the Cheeseburger others about the Tuna Tartare, these are but a few amidst many appetizing menu items.  The Irish Organic Salmon baked on a cedar plank and accompanying grain/almond salad were delicious. My husband decided to try out the cheeseburger during our most recent visit and he was equally impressed.  Overall we rate e11even at 4.5"}
{"text":"Definatley should be a stop if your ever in the downtown area.  The staff are very friendly and professional.  The food tastes amazingly fresh and favourful, not to mention beautifully presented. The restaurant has a nice ambience and seating similar to a lounge. Will definatley be back."}
{"text":"I don't know why yelp users rate this resto with an average of 3 stars, while urban spoon (with more reviews rates it 4.5) maybe because any new place needs to iron out the kinks and for me, and a group with 7 others, we had an overall EXCELLENT experience.

Everything from my martini at the bar to our food and wine recommended by the sommelier was off the chart good.  The service was impeccable and this is from a guy who worked the food services industry and took great pride in serving and wine pairings.

I could not find one thing wrong with this restaurant other than MLSE owns it.

I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I have been here before when it first opened and remember this place as a great steak experience. I had the chance to try this place again lately. We came here with a large group function for cocktails and dinner last month. We were off in the private room upstairs. Great service and cocktails. For dinner we had several options. I chose the lump crab cake, hangar steak and maple bread pudding. The food was amazing. Crab cake was just right real crab meat and fresh. Hangar steak was very tender i believe they used sirloin or tenderloin. Maple bread pudding tasted like a rock cake rather than your traditional pudding. I would definitely come back to try the regular menu."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service and tasty food. Ordered the fried chicken sandwich with parmesan truffle fries - both were delicious."}
{"text":"Seriously why would you go here?  My girlfriend and I went here for a lobster roll and lobster mac and cheese based upon some of the other yelp reviews.  Big mistake.
As soon as we ordered, the food came out.  I'm talking like 3 minutes later, no joke. How could they possibly have prepared it that quick?  The lobster mac was barely warm, bland, and mostly lifeless.  The lobster roll was bland and tasteless.  It came with oily french fries that had sat under a heat lamp for a quite a while and a little bit of a surprise.  A shell surprise to be exact.  I crunched on a little bit of lobster shell in my sandwich while I pondered our bad decision of coming here.  Basically cafeteria-quality food here with a big impressive price tag.  Oh, and the fancy bread that everywhere mentions on yelp?  Where is it?  I'll tell you....they don't bring it.  They don't offer it.  They don't mention it.  They don't talk about it.  It's the big white elephant in the room. But you'll never know anything about it unless you specifically request it from your waitress....that doesn't want to bring it.  But maybe that's not so bad after all.  After I specifically requested it...it arrived.  I will admit I was excited.  This bread was going to save the night.  This bread was going to be my lifeline in the storm-ridden high seas.  Because I was drowning.  This bread everything.    I took a bite.  Hot and heavy.  And dry.  The lifeline had failed...I was done.  No dessert, no more drinks....we were just done...and we had been duped."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to check this place out and I'm glad I can take it off my list now and possibly returning sooner then I thought so. 

Beautiful candlelit atmosphere, it's a dark venue which makes me love it even more. Lots of seating!

We got a bottle of white wine( forgot the name, tasted kind of blah, should've gotten a recommendation!)

We ordered:
- Grilled Calamari ($16)
I LOVE grilled calamari, they give you about 4 pieces, it was perfect. 
- Seared Tuna Salad ($26)
It's a huge portion, very filling, tasted great.
- Crab Cake ($22)
It comes in 2( the usual) very FRESH!! One of the best crab cakes I ever had.
- Sorbet w/ Fresh Berries ($11)
It's the perfect end to freshen up the taste buds with sweet tangy sorbet; flavours were strawberry, lemon and I forgot the other one. The fresh fruit at the bottom was the perfect marriage."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO THERE!!! This must be the most arrogant and \"superior\" restaurant there is out there. you will eat overpriced food with people who dress all uptight and and treat people awfully. If you are a loving person I would STAY AWAY!. I had a layover with my daughter in Toronto And we went to the city to go eat something and try to have a nice experience. As soon as I walked in there was a man standing there in a suit possibly the manager and two ladies one very rude blonde one,  the man in the suit gave us the rudest look in fact all of them did. I didn't have a good feeling about this. It's not how waiters greet customers last time I checked! But wait it gets worse. She then unpleasantly said ok I can seat you over here, all the way in the corner in like a waiting area, Where you wait for tables ! The restaurant was literally empty it was barely lunch time!!!! And there were tiny tables lower then my knees in the \"seats\" she sat us in !!!!' How are we gonna eat this overpriced food properly in seats like this ? Then a waitress came for our drinks I asked her if we could get proper seats she just said that's up to the hostess. I just told her we will just leave its okay and she said okay rudely and they couldn't wait for us to be out the door. Such big headed and heartless people. I don't know why they discriminate like this . Maybe they don't like kids in the restaurant but why not just inform us that then. I WOULD STAY AWAY plenty of nicer restaurant around with less conceited people. I like to be in a relaxing loving environment Opposite what they got going on over there *barf and YUCK!  Again STAY AWAY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is overdue. Came here about 3 months ago and forgot to post my findings. 

Appetizer of mention: Double Cut Bacon w/ Maple Sherry Glaze. 
For $11 you get 2 really thick cut pieces of bacon on a plate. 2 slices for $11 seems pretty ridiculous, but it was amazing and you could literally cut off tiny slices and savour each individual bite, making it seem suddenly justifiable.

For dinner I had the Baby Back Ribs, which come with diced up peanuts spread on top of. It was a quality rack of ribs cooked quite well with a good flavoured sauce. Also pricey at $32 but with a cold pint of Creemore this was also a delicious meal so even after its all said and done, justifiable in paying said price.

While the place ain't cheap, it is delicious and the service was good so I can't help but say, \"Yay! I'm a fan\"."}
{"text":"Came to dinner last night with my fiancé, the ambiance was very nice.  Our waitress was very nice and attentive, We ordered a salad which was good! We both had the cheeseburger which was amazing and cooked exactly how I had asked it to be cooked! The only thing I did not like was they added mustard on the bun ( which is not their fault I should of double checked ) so when ordering the burger if mustard is not your favorite here is your reminder! but other then that everything was amazing ! Thank you"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience here! We needed somewhere close to the acc to eat as we were going to the Raptors game on a Friday night. Called a few days ahead and they had no issues giving us a reservation for 6 pm, which is amazing because a lot of places near sporting events will not do reservations on these nights. We were running late due to traffic, I called the reservation line and told them, she was so nice and had no issue moving it up 15 minutes so we wouldn't lose it (please note the place was completely packed when we got there). We were seated right away at a nice booth spot in the back away from the loud bar. 
The hostess was really nice as well, when I told her my boyfriend would be along shortly he was just getting parked she let me know that if you parked next door at longos and spent 20 in longos your parking is only 6 bucks. Unfortunately it was too late he already parked (but everywhere else is 30 dollars so you may as well pick up some food at longos and get something more for your money).
Now on to what people actually care about! The food! I got the veggie burger and fries and my boyfriend got the regular burger and fries. For drinks we got the New Fashion and Georgian Mule. The drinks were superb but oh so over priced, normally I would knock off a star for overpricing so much (note drink cost as much as my meal!) But look where you are, downtown beside the ACC, honestly what do you expect? 
I my Veggie burger was incredible, the patty had like a sweet BBQ sauce grilled in, I don't even know what the actual inside was comprised of but it was the perfect texture, perfect balance of flavours and not soy like at all. It came on a toasted buttered bun, with a tomato (which I promptly removed), pickles, and a coleslaw type topping. It's 8 am right now and thinking about it makes me want it again right now lol. It was also a reasonable price, 16. The fries were great too, thin and crispy. Also note that this was a lunch item menu that they made me for dinner - I do suggest they have it on the dinner menu as well.
So yes is E11even expensive? Kind of but it you're getting great food, great service and you're in the Raptors nest, so it is super convenient."}
{"text":"Since my last review, I've been to e11even 5 other times and I made sure to go for lunch again one of those times. I had a Tandoori Chicken sandwich which was absolutely delicious. On the other occasions I had a steak with chimmichuri, on another occasion I had the salmon, another occasion I had the Guinness burger and I absolutely loved every single meal. I now have a 6 month son and we take him with us. Its noisy by the bar area which is great because that way if he cries it won't bother anyone! lol . I love the fresh baked bread with garlic. Its soooo good."}
{"text":"I came here primarily for drinks and had some side dishes. Service was good, we received good recommendations for drinks. However, when it got to the appetizers, my group was quite disappointed. 
I ordered the Tuna Tartare- this was not fresh, it had that slight fishy taste (yes it's fish but it shouldn't have that taste when it's fresh).
I asked for another recommendation and was told the Honey Peanut Shrimp was good. It was not, I'm guessing seafood is just a no-no for Ele11ven. The sauce was too heavy, probably because it was an attempt to mask the fact that the shrimp was low quality as well. One of my friends ordered a burger that was quite pink on the inside, they had to send it back to re-cook. I sampled my friends' dishes as well and there was nothing good so I gave up and just drank.
Tip: Ladies, the real star of e11even is in the restrooms, only reason why I still come back."}
{"text":"Really not impressed with service and really not worth the price.

I went there around 9h00 pm as I finished work... Was told the main restaurant was closed but could sit at the bar section.... I did not seem to have a real waiter and people had no real interest in providing service.

To order my wine, I was just handed an ipad with no explanation. 

Steak was good.... but this was more expensive then Ruth Chris and the food was not as good and the experience really was not as good.

I will not go back."}
{"text":"My sister and I drove to Toronto from Long Island, NY to see The Weeknd play at Air Canada.. After our long 12 hour drive, reading these great reviews on Yelp, and making a reservation.. I was extremely happy this was where we chose for dinner. We were greeted with smiles and taken in right away, keep in mind it was a Friday evening and right before a concert. Our waitress, Megan, was absolutely AMAZING. She knew the menu, the drinks, and was so personable and friendly. I normally don't write reviews on Yelp, but this restaurant definitely deserved it after my ENTIRE experience. The drinks were great and a perfect blend, our steaks were cooked perfectly, and the staff (especially Megan) was wonderful. Thank you for making us very happy (and ridiculously full) after our visit. We will be back!"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS!!

Asked for 2 glasses of Pinot Noir, lovely time with my friend, asked for the bill or as they cheekily put it (The Damage)...$82.00!!! WHAT? YUP! oh and $3 tacked on for the tasting! Case in point, make sure you find out what each glass costs, b/c they sure won't advise you!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. In Canada with my husband for one night and we made the mistake of choosing this place as our only meal for the day. Waiter never came with our appetizer. When I asked to cancel after our meal arrived is when he remembered we had ordered one. I ordered the roasted chicken that he recommended and after 15 minutes comes back and says that they are out of the chicken. I order a burger, $26- for a burger, and 30 minutes later my roasted chicken is served. Confusing. 
My husband got the steak which was fine but pricey. My mashed potatoes were bland with no flavor- comparable to boxed kind. Chicken was dry with zero flavor. Stuffing was actually good but wasn't worth $30. Far from it. Again, disappointment"}
{"text":"you can tell when a restaurant is just trying too hard to be swanky, upscale, douche-y, etc. when there is a \"11\" in the name and they use iPads for the drink menu. nevertheless, e11even has become the de facto place for pre-drinking and eating before a Maple Leaf game....which is what we did. there is nothing very special about the menu, but that said, the food is pretty decent (not awesome, but not inedible, flavours a little too salty/rich). as for the prices...yes, it's pricey, but it's still cheaper than anything you'd get at the ACC."}
{"text":"FYI...this place is really dark.  Like, maybe have to read the menu by your cell phone glare, dark. 

Drinks are a little pricey, but the Georgia Mule was really good. 

The soup special (parsnip, potato and leek) was velvety and seasoned well. It is a pretty big portion, so order accordingly. The scallop dish was good, the scallops were cooked perfectly and the sautéed mushrooms complimented them well. The dollop of bacon jam was ok...it was more sweet than savory and I didn't think it paired well, but others may. 

If you are a kale love, the steak salad would be a good choice. There are a few strips of steak on top of a literal mound of kale...with a few butter lettuce leaves and a sprig or two of arugula. There are toasted walnuts and broccoli florets scattered around. The dressing was good, but raw kale is a tough chew."}
{"text":"I just realized that I didn't write a review for this place, came here last year after our downtown day. Nice ambience and the selection and the menu wasn't too bad...the service was alright as well...nothing really amazed me in terms of the quality of food and drink menu...everything was a 3** in my personal opinion. We were seated promptly upon arrival.

The seats were comfortable and the food was average...

all in all, a place I would come back"}
{"text":"Great dining experience; ordered fish of the day & it was delicious!  Diver Scallops with grilled asparagus & a Chimichurri sauce. Service was attentive at the bar, had a delicious Sangria. Closed up the meal with a fresh sorbet for desert.

As I was getting ready to wrap up the night, was given my choice of a complimentary desert!  BTW, very yummy strawberry sorbet. 

Update my review to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm starting to feel like all my reviews in Toronto are in the \"almost but not quite\" category. I chose kale salad once again. Tasty, fresh, well-conceived, but it was supposed to have wild rice, and there couldn't have been more than a dozen grains. And there was still a bit of grit in the kale. I think my husband's tuna salad was better.  BTW, it's a little weird for the girl from San Diego to be eating avocado in Canada. I'm trying to do some local eating (and drinking), but I'm unimpressed by Canadian Pinot noirs."}
{"text":"4.5 / 5

I've only been to e11even once but from that one experience it seems to be a pretty great place.

The location of the restaurant is one of the first positive things you'll notice about it.  Sure it kind of sucks to have to pay for parking since this place is in the downtown core of toronto, but I personally think the atmosphere and easy access to any other sites of attraction make it worthwhile.  The great views of downtown toronto add to the restaurant since it has a plentiful amount of outdoor seating where you can view several toronto landmarks such as the ACC (which is literally 30 seconds away) and the CN tower.  I can't comment too much about the interior because my friends and I were only in there for about 2 minutes before we were seated outdoors, but from what I could tell the inside was very welcoming and had a very nice appealing look.

I ordered the maple burger with a side of fries.  The maple burger was extremely good, with thick juicy slices of bacon on top of a great patty which was crispy on the outside yes still tender on the inside.  The fries were also good, I'm not sure what it was that made them so stand out but somehow they managed to taste better than most fries you get at other burger places.  

I ordered my meal along with a coke and I beleive the final bill was somewhere around $35 without the tip.  A bit on the pricey side but the taste was definitely good enough to warrant the slightly high price"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend.  He had steak and calamari to start.  I had the halibut with ceasar salad to start.  Waitress was friendly and very warm even if we stayed well pass the lunch rush.  I would recommend it and will return there again."}
{"text":"Little pricey but really tasty food. The signature chicken was a little tasty thou but other than that .. good ambience and good food."}
{"text":"It's a noisy place but that is exactly what you will like about it. Being next to the Air Canada centre, you can stop here before or after a game. I went  after work on a Friday evening and for sure it got me into the weekend mood. The drinks options  and food here are very good. You get an iPad to check out the drinks menu. You have to try out the Georgian Mule that is served in a copper mug and is a twist of the Moscow Mule. It is a Peach  vodka based drink with lime and ginger beer in it. Recommended by the staff and folks, it feels great when you say cheers with a copper mug. The appetizers (nachos) are my favourite. It's busy out there but the staff is attentive and quick."}
{"text":"Just dropped in for a glass of wine... Impressive selection by the glass... But what's with the no WiFi?  Especially since the menus are on tablets on an intranet...

Really not feeling it.  An MLS&E franchise without charm.  A place to meet and overpay.  Worth noting that I was there for drinks, and can't review the food.  I am sure it was expensive given the locale, but also likely quite good, as most Chris Z. restaurants are.

I will likely end up here when can't get in to Hot Stove, but for the money would probably opt for Harbour 60.

Stay tuned for an update once I have dined."}
{"text":"Such a cute place. I took some clients there for lunch. They dived right into the drink menu. I learned what a Cesar was.

We shared apps: Buffalo cauliflower, the sheep's milk ricotta, and the honey peanut shrimp. All great! 

For my main course, I got the lobster mac & cheese. it was rich and delicious and I'm sure calorie free. :)

Good place for a business lunch."}
{"text":"I was here (this time) for drinks and dinner with the girls (a table of 3 on the patio). 

The cocktails (Dark & Stormy & Pretty in Pink) were both hits at the table but the Sangria was nothing exciting. It tasted like store bought pre-mix that they simply added some fruit to. It was lacking that fresh, fruity refreshing flavour that one expects from good Sangria - especially in June on a patio. It was not worth the $14 price tag.

Here was our order...

Lobster Cob Salad
-my friend said it was lovely and as requested, the dressing was brought on the side

Maple Burger
-this was my order and although it was incredibly indulgent (kind of a man`s burger - LOL), I thought it was delicious! It came with thick cut back (YUM) and Guinness cheddar (oh ya!!)  

Vegan Burger
-this is not on the menu but my other friend is vegan and asked if the chef would mind creating something for her (since there were no vegan options on the menu). She said it was quite good (although it was a very small portion as it was not served on a bun)

I will go back because it is a nice patio and not as crazy busy as some of the others located in the financial district after 5pm in the summer. 

The food is good but yes, the prices are high as you would expect due to its location. 

Our server was delightful and attentive."}
{"text":"Had a lovely meal here to celebrate a special occasion in February (we all know what it is). Surprisingly, they were not swamped even during the peak dinner hours on such a popular day. Our server explained that it's because everyone rushes off when games start at the ACC and everyone comes back once the game is done. All the better for a quiet dinner in the meantime! 

The service, drinks, and food was excellent throughout the night. We each ordered a drink and shared the Lamb Ribs to start. The lamb ribs were well seared and had the right balance between fat and meat. After our appetizer, our server came around with a little dish complements of the chef. The item was a light crisp cracker with a light paste (don't remember what it was) and sprinkle of cavier. It was a light refreshing bite. 

I had the Signature Roast Chicken as my main. It was a really large portion for me because it includes half a chicken with mashed potatoes and sides. The chicken was moist, tender and delicious. I usually find chicken breast too dry, but e11even definitely knows how to make it just right!

To round off the night, they provided a heart-shaped chocolate cake in a pretty box as a parting gift. What a wonderful little surprise for Valentine's Day!"}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance. Upscale with a great menu. Dessert was amazing the apple pie is where it's at. They exceeded exception when it came to their restrooms, not only was it clean and stylish but the toilets heated and gave you a massage!"}
{"text":"After visiting Ripley's Aquarium we went to e11even for a bite to eat. I've been here before but it was the first time for my wife. What started off as a little slow on the service made up for in the end. RESTAURANTEURS TAKE NOTE: Our Main meal was a Prime Rib and a Steak Frites. Although very tasty, the meat for both of our dishes was cold but our sides were hot (obviously bad timing from the kitchen). When the server asked how was out meal? I mentioned the cold meat to her but added we are so hungry that we will just eat it. Few minutes later the Manager came by to apologize and asked if he could buy us dessert or coffee. We said no since we are not major sweet -tooth people and that we are fine with the meal. At that point the manager offered us another glass of wine on the house. When the bill came e11even comped all of our wine. There are times when a restaurant will mess up an order or not deliver the food properly. The way the staff handles it speaks volumes about the place. E11even did that and more. We will come back just based on the customer service alone. Great job and looking forward to a incredible \"HOT\" meal (Lol)
But seriously, this is a great place!"}
{"text":"It's a pretty average, uninteresting restaurant, but the food is decent. The burgers are a generous portion but otherwise are no different from any comparable restaurant. Ambience is nice and the restaurant is a comfortable setting; service is excellent too. It's a good enough place that I wouldn't mind coming back here, but there's very little that would make me have an urge to return here specifically."}
{"text":"I'd like to say E11even is an overpriced Jack Astor's... Except that Jack Astor's has more options for food and that, at least at Jack's, you sort of get what you pay for (for the most part). For $26 at E11even, I got a fancy burger - the Maple something or other - which turned out to be a burger (lettuce, tomato) with a piece of pork belly and melted cheese on top. Now, I typically LOVE pork belly anything, but this particular slab was thick, parts of which were too tough to chew, and in combination with the cheese made the entire thing SO salty. In the end, I wound up leaving off half the bun, the cheese, the stack of lettuce and the parts of the pork belly I couldn't chew through if you paid me to. AKA I spent $26 on a patty, 1/2 slice of pork belly and a piece of tomato. I never mind spending money on good food, but there is nothing I hate more than feeling like money was wasted on subpar food. Especially for a place whose prices only match their location, and not their QUALITY of food. 

At least the fries were good..."}
{"text":"Probably one of few places downtown where I can get  consistency in terms of food and service. I've been here numerous of times when I used to work in the Telus building and the maple burger and hot dog dish were actually quite delicious. The French fries with truffle oil also pair nicely. 

Service here is top notch - same service for everyone even though some people (ahem, suits) might expect VIP treatment, keep in mind that a lot of the clientele includes fans heading to the ACC. 

I most recently tried out their brunch menu and it wasn't too bad. I ordered the steak and eggs and my boyfriend got the maple burger. We also tried their croissant and scones and they came out fresh and warm with butter and a homemade jam. The steak and eggs was a lot smaller than I expected but it was a good enough portion for me. Might not be enough for the average guy though. 

My boyfriends maple burger was another story. It was big enough to share and it was hard to look across the table with him gobbling up every juicy bite with drippings down his hand. 

I'm never disappointed when I come to e11even, just come prepared to pay a little extra for good food in a fancier atmosphere. 

BEST PART: the bidets in the women's washroom!!! Heated seats!!! Oh yeah."}
{"text":"After leaving the Raptors-Jazz game, we decided to find a place to eat and stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant.  As soon as you walk in, the ambience and decor immediately struck me as sexy, moody and sophisticated.  One of the first thing I noticed was the background music playing throughout - 'Bonita Applebaum' by A Tribe Called Quest.  Impressive already.

Waiter approached us right away and handed us the infamous iPads to order drinks.  Which led us to one of the main reasons I'm giving 5 stars...THE BREAD.  OMFG the bread.  That is all I'm going to say about it.  Mind blown.

I ordered the steak bites (medium well) and truffle parmesan fries.  Perfect and perfect.  My lady friend ordered the Sheep's Milk Ricotta...she loved it.  I used the cheese on the complimentary bread and it was fantastic, of course.

Overall, the service, ambience, food and presentation were top notch.  Absolutely cannot WAIT to go back."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night for a friend's birthday. Party of 5. It was very quiet given that summer is in full swing, but that was nice. Be prepared to shell out some good $$$ here..

On the downside..(good stuff coming later)
Its a really big space and the table was so large, sometimes it was hard to hear the convo, so we would push in to get cozy.  The server thought there was a 6th person,so didn't take our food order for a while. The whole IPad drinks menu feels gimicky  - would be more useful if you could order your drink using the IPad and the waiter would bring it to your table, NOW THAT is using technology. Otherwise, its just a glorified paper menu (which have a lot of pros eg, everyone on the table gets their own, no sharing, no \"back\" button required to switch between screens etc).

Now why I am a FAN..
The free bread is so GOOD! If I didn't have a big dinner on the way, I would have had 2 of these all by myself. Ordered the chicken with a side of mashed potatoes and stuffing. It was the last chicken (at 9PM really??) but it was DELICIOUS! Great portion, melt-in-your-mouth mashed potatoes (drooling when I think of it now) and the chicken was just tender, flavorful, which is usually hard to pull of with chicken. 

Other raves on the table -  steak fillet, small portion but was done just right. Sweet potatoes had just the right amount of crunch, cheese burger was juicy, not overly done full of filings, thus the high staff recommendation for this dish. Mushroom gnocci plate was so small, and had salad at the bottom, almost as though it was a filler - if you are hungry, don't order this (especially at $23?!!). Mac n cheese lobster appetizer was delish as well.

Dessert was creme brulee, was also really yummy. The server put \"happy birthday X\" for our friend around the plate which was a nice touch, although better would be provide a complimentary desert with a candle at least, after all this is a pricey place, surely they can afford that?

Also, paid a visit to the Toto toilet (ladies washroom), very interesting had only seen them on tv shows quite funny, warmed seats that seem to have all kinds of settings..possibly need another trip to explore this further lol!!!

The \"Damage\" (aka the bill) as they put it was quite extensive, but its a birthday so what to do. Overall great service, very tasty food and lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"Visiting Canada and my girlfriends brought me here for dinner! Where do I begin? The ambience was great and the fun was phenomenal. I ordered steak frites and truffle mac and cheese with a blueberry smash for a drink. Delicious! The drink is made with Hennessy so I was sold at first sight! Our server was very attentive and kind. Our desserts were comped because the food was late and Chris (who is amaze balls) let us take pics in the wine cellar! Dope! The music was spot on and we had an overall great night! I'll be back without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, the drink menu is brought to you on an Ipad... COOL.  Loved the mirror that allows diners to see directly into the kitchen, foodies dream.  I had the petite filet and the truffled mac and cheese with the Rioja wine YUM.  The New York Cheesecake was sooo good!  Service was excellent as for Morbina she was awesome.  It is a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Service was really great. Food was mediocre. I ordered the smoked chicken. It may have tasted ok but I personally don't think it is worth it for the price."}
{"text":"I came here before a Raptors game for a quick dinner and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. It was definitely much more gourmet than expected for a bar/restaurant located across from ACC.

What we ordered:
- Lobster Mac N Cheese -- delicious with some sizeable chunks of lobster! 
- Spinach & Artichoke dip -- pretty good, though not a stand out
- White wine - they had a pretty decent selection
- Shrimp cocktail - the shrimps were HUGE and fresh with the \"crunch\" that only fresh seafood has
- cheese burger - our waitress raved about it

Service was pretty good. We were tight on time and they made a good effort to accommodate us and bring our food out very quickly. The only downside is that they forgot our 2nd order of shrimp cocktail.

The decor is dark and swanky, but very loud. They had iPads on each table where you could order your wine quickly and easily :).

The prices were a bit high, but I guess that's to be expected with the location. E.g. $20 for cheese burger + fries, $10 for shrimp cocktail. Overall, a good non-fast food option for dinner prior to an ACC game, which is nice to have."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed down the street when visiting Toronto for the first time. We didn't know where to eat, so based on location we stopped at E11even and we're glad we did. We ordered the bread to start. It came out warm and was delicious. For dinner we ordered the maple burger and pesto shrimp linguine. The burger came with a big slab of juicy bacon. The shrimp linguine was amazing. The only reason we gave it a 4 is the service was a little slow. Our waitress didn't check in with us often enough and the food took a little too long. We would go back though just because the food was so good!"}
{"text":"The service is quite good. The crab cake isn$21 but delicious. The meatball was $21 and nothing you can't make at home for $5 of groundbeef and ragu. Really wasn't worth the price. The lobster roll wasn't bad, but the ravioli was fantastic. Unique and very strong, but you're a fan of smoked cheese, I strongly recommend it. Overall the food was very good and presented nicely, but NOWHERE near worth the price. Definitely an over-priced restaurant and it's most likely due to the location."}
{"text":"Got taken here by a vendor one evening. 

Try their Moscow Mule and their Gin and Tonics. Fantastic bartenders behind the bar. The Mac and Cheese and their flatbreads are great too! A bit pricey but definitely quality food that you are getting back in return!

Awesome location and decor here. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Over priced...wallets hurting a bit. Who knew things could be so pricy? Was here after a raptor game & looking for food. Once u step inside, it's obvious what the atmosphere is like. A hangout for yuppies, chic, loud music, mod, almost like a posh club... my hubby said pretentious :) But we stayed anyway since it was V-day.

Did not know what to order... but didn't want to pay $20 for cheeseburger. 

we had...

Crab Cake $ 21 
Irish Organic Salmon w/ wild grain & almond salad $31
Slow Roasted Prime Ribs $ 30

They served us a round pan of warm toasty carbs. It tasted so good w/ the butter ^^ The crab cake was delicious but it was only one med size crab cake. The whole time I was only thinking this is great but not for $20. Rest of the dishes was not out of this world spectacular.  Ribs were overcooked. I did enjoy the wild grain & almond salad that came w/ my fresh yet slightly undercooked salmon though :) Still ok.

I thought the drinks menu was such a cool idea. They used an IPad for this :D 

Service was good. The waitress was very friendly and asked how things were a few times. 

We found out from the waitress that E11even is also 'the restaurant' for the maple leaf & raptors players. But they prob place them in a secret room or everyone will harass them :) We were told 3 raptors were there last night. But did not see any of them in person."}
{"text":"Food is a bit pricey but this is a good place for drinks."}
{"text":"I visited e11even with a friend.  We enjoyed a week day lunch with our waitress, a Scarlett Johansson look a like.  We went light today as both ordered the Seared Tuna Salad, which was very tasty with lots of flavors.  I could have gone for seconds."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a quality restaurant in the hotel le Germaine. I really enjoyed the cocktail, carrot salad and the scallops. This is not 5 star in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"The quality of food was once top notch. Now? Not so much. Trendy vibe and atmosphere can't make up for the downgrade in food. 
I ordered my favorite - lobster mac and cheese. Bottom was burned. It was dry. Highly upsetting. 
I'll have to scratch e11even off my list of Toronto restaurants. No bueno. 
Service was awesome, which is nice."}
{"text":"Food was good but it is very overpriced. We had some good wine with the help of the sommelier. I ordered scallops - it's only 4 scallops with nothing else. Delicious but for 40 I would expect even a side of veggies. I tried the tuna tartare off a friend and that was equally as delicious. Ambiance is nice service was fast."}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday date night, enjoyed everything, service was fantastic, ordered the squash gnocci, flatbread and had key lime pie for dessert. Food was great, the key lime wasn't fantastic but above average. They have their own concoction of the 'Vesper' drink... definitely try this! It's $18 but it's completely worth it. One of the best mixed drinks I've ever had."}
{"text":"Had a great time celebrating a birthday before a Toronto Rock game!  Food was amazing and a decent price considering.  The service was perfect and even brought the birthday boy a special dessert.  Will for sure go back!"}
{"text":"We went here as part of our Toronto Life's Top 25 burger places. This ranked #11 on the list. Having just gotten married and soon moving to stoney creek we wnated our last 4 months here to be full of dining goodness. We had high expectations for the $25.00 maple burger. We asked the server to bring two pints of beer, 1 order of the burger to split, and an order of their truffled mac and cheese (cause...why not?). 
The service was excellent (cool ipad ordering system by the way) and our meal came out within 20 minutes. They had split the burger in half and served it onto two seperate plates for us(this makes fighting over bites non existent). We both dove into the burger. DAYYYM son. It was juicy and the first thign you taste is the delicious maple bacon...and then...oh wait...the aged cheddar..just hits you! The burger was a solid size for 1 ....definately with the fries it comes with...too much. Just perfect for sharing. The bun was awesome...it held onto the burger and just a few drips of yummy moist grease dripped down my hands. but i loved it. We both nodded and agreed... this was a damn good burger and one of the best weve ever had. We ranked the burger a 9.75 in total. The only downside being the price. If the burger was 20.00 I would relent and give this a solid 10. 25.00 just seems a bit excessive to me. The fries were good...nothing to write home about but good filler. And the truffled mac and cheese was just how i like my mac n cheese...oooey gooey and crunchy on the top. I pretty much licked the bowl clean. Im classy.

Definately check this place out for an amazing burger. just be prepared for the bill which approriately comes in a cute little envelope entitled, \"the damage\". 

Our bill for 2 pints, 1 burger, 1 mac and cheese side. after tax and a 20% tip = 80.00
a bit hefty for a casual lunch but we enjoyed it and splurged."}
{"text":"My friend, whom I meet on a regular basis and works in the same building as E11ven  & decided this was a convenient place to meet up.
She's an executive who was invited to their opening - sampling almost everything.  She frequents this place with clients said the food was very good.
We were greeted by the hostess in a friendly manner, and once seated our server introduced himself.  He was very pleasant and friendly as well.
I scanned the menu and  noticed it was pricey, but thought it ok,  in given their location and upscale  atmosphere (though I found it very loud when I first entered - thankfully, we had a banquet at the far end of the restaurant - at the kitchen end)
I don't usually take note of prices, but I did think $11 for (virgin)lemonade was steep.
After referring to my fellow Yelpers, and upon my friend's recommendation, I ordered the crab cake (which I did wince slightly at it's 26$ price tag). Since crab is my weak-in-the-knees favourite seafood, and assurance from my friend that it was amazing, I ordered it.  Being a gracious guest (I guess, lol), I didn't order a pricey entrée, so I went with the burger (around 26-8$, I think).  My friend had the salmon.
Presentation of the crab cake was nice -  though I'd expect no less
:( ...  Big! disappointment.
It had a mushy interior, and TOTALLY overwhelmed by too much tarragon.  My friend had a taste and agreed that it was not as good as usual.  I kick myself now for not sending it back.  I never mind paying for quality, but in the back of my mind, I was thinking of the ACE crab legs at the Mandarin.  It was about the size of half a hockey puck, so even the portion size was a miss.
Our entrees arrived - **before I was finished with my app - point against the server (kitchen?).  At a place of this supposed stature, I expect near perfect service. .. Don't bring the entrée to get cold while I'm still on my app!  I also take points off the server for not checking on me after a couple bites of my app. - I was a server, and that is just what you're supposed to do!
When ordering my burger, I asked how what the default doneness was. (Fresh, quality meat should be able to order it mid rare, and I expected based upon the price, it SHOULD be fresh ground)  He said it came med-well, (omg - that's murder in my book) I told him I wanted it no more than medium.  
All the flowery description of the burger doesn't make up for a dry, over-done burger, with thick bacon that's so overdone; it's stringy & tough.  The bun was too big in ratio for the meat and wasn't as fresh as it could've been.  So along with a dry burger, stringy bacon; the stale-ish bun didn't help. I've had better burgers at fast food chains.
The only reason for the 2nd star is the pleasant facility and .... oh boy.. ladies bathroom!!!
I also take points away for a group of servers I passed on my way to the restroom hanging out and chatting up a loudly like no one was around.
E11even is an upscale place to hang out before an event at the ACC/ Roger's Centre.
Although our server was friendly, he was not competent -  he didn't check on us to ensure our food was ok while we ate.  He only showed up to deliver and pick up.
I might sound snobby, but I don't think it's too much to ask in expecting competent service should that matchs the establishment and the prices.   
I might return for drinks before a game or concert due to it's location and comfortable ambience.  
Because my friend frequents this place and said it's been good whenever she'd been, I'm wondering if the kitchen had deployed their 'B team' (or 'C' team...) during the week.  
The food was a big fail."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for dates, chilling on the patio with friends, drinks after a game, and events in the private reception area upstairs. 

Every experience I have had here has been different but I always have a good time - definitely my favourite restaurant in the area. A couple times it was super full and had a short wait despite having a reservation but generally the hostess is able to seat us quickly. The restaurant is modern and upbeat and I've always had excellent service here, the hostess, servers and event staff are all incredibly attentive and nice. 

The food here is always delicious and they have a great wine list. Their patio is nice in the summer and I always get their oysters when they are in season. 

Some things I remember trying: 

I've tried every salad on their menu and they were all really good. 

The halibut was cooked perfectly - I was pleasantly surprised because so many restaurants do it wrong. 

The burger. I don't know if I was starving or if this was actually just a really delicious burger but I thought it was the best thing ever at the time. 

Oysters. The first time I ordered them I was nervous about getting oysters at a random restaurant but they turned out to be delicious! The waitress recommended them and they were perfect. I was so happy that day. 

This sounds ridiculous but I always get really excited to come here for their bread and wine list. I usually don't want bread on the table because I will eat it but the bread here is actually so good I eat it all and I feel really guilty. You know how you are supposed to pick one of the three if you want to not gain weight: bread, wine, or dessert? Well I totally fail at that every time I come here. 

The space upstairs is really nice for a casual mixer with a smaller crowd. The staff was amazing and super helpful. Sometimes the restaurant is a little quiet earlier in the evening, I like a more upbeat atmosphere but for the location it's still my favourite place in the area. 

Overall would definitely recommend checking it out especially in the summer :)"}
{"text":"My first visit for brunch was wonderful, and since I live a block away I thought it would be a perfect place to bring my dad and his girlfriend for supper when they visited me in town on a Saturday night.

Not only were they out of tuna tartare, tuna salad and whole chicken (?) but there is only ONE bottle of wine priced under 100$ which I find to be a little bit ridiculous. The average bottle on the list was going for 200$. 

For a restaurant to command that type of pricing would necessitate an exquisite menu with all food items present.

Quite disappointing in general."}
{"text":"I went here with my work wife and we downed 3 bottles of wine. This is the place to go ladies if you want to spot some seriously hot guys with money! Especially before a game at the Rogers Centre...
We ordered the seafood platter, which is pretty hard to mess up, so it was tasty. Next time I'm going for the steak. Great atmosphere and cute waiters."}
{"text":"Tried out the private dining room for a corp event and the staff and food was above average.  S7ch a cool space overlooking maple leaf square ..but it does have an ofd layout.  Menu was solid and flavours delish"}
{"text":"Service is great, and the ambiance is nice and very sleek.  I ordered the lobster roll, it was good, but I like my rolls hot.  I've had great lobster rolls,  but this was satisfying."}
{"text":"Some important notes:
- I am not Canadian, so can not say how this place compares to other places nearby.
- I visited on a Wednesday evening, prior to a concert at the Air Canada Centre.

This restaurant was picked by some friends that we were meeting for a concert.  As we are all basically tourists in Toronto, I believe the main criteria for selection were a.) closeness to the Air Canada Centre, and b.) had reservation availability for 2 couples.

We (one couple) showed up right on time for our 5 pm reservation... and even though the 2nd couple had not yet arrived, we were shown to the table.  While we waited for the rest of our party, our server (Alexander) gave us the run down on the iPad drink menu.  I suppose it was nice... but not completely needed.  I would think if you are going to go through the trouble of using technology, you would also make it more... I don't know... inspiring?  It wasn't much more than an electronic version of what you find on the tables at Applebees.  But I digress...

We ordered a couple house cocktails - a Georgian Mule and something I forgot the name of (it was like a mojito, only with berries).  Both were delicious, and at $14 each... did not seem drastically overpriced. Just slightly overpriced.

The other couple was over 30 minutes late for our reservation time... which is uncomfortable and embarrassing... but Alexander was never rude or pushy.  He was very gracious and accommodating.  We found the service to be the highlight of the visit.  

The biggest downside... the food prices.  Again, maybe it's normal for Toronto, or for this area of Toronto... but the food prices were suffocating.  It was all delicious.  Definitely the best $22 cheeseburger I have ever eaten (with an additional $10 upgrade for truffled parmesan fries).  But I have had MANY $7-$12 cheeseburgers that were far superior.

Really... this place is wonderful.  Clean, beautiful environment, friendly and attractive staff, delicious food.  Not what I would pick for a pre-concert place.  (I suppose I am more akin to something less upscale with fried food for pre-concert).  We should have gone to something more casual.

But this would be perfect if you are celebrating your night out.  If you are looking for a good $40-$50 meal, they had some good looking entrees."}
{"text":"Wonderful and friendly service all around! The food was amazing my girlfriend got the filet and I had the special Cajun rib eye. While definitely pricey I found the food and experience to be pleasurable and worth it! They even comped us with a free dessert to celebrate my girlfriends birthday! Definitely recommended for a fine dining experience"}
{"text":"This review is for the brunch on Sunday. The food itself was actually pretty good -- I had the French Toast. However, service and flexibility were almost nonexistent. Our waiter was helpful but it took forever for the food to come out -- so long in fact that one of us had to take it to go. On top of this asking for something simple like how we would like eggs done we found out you cannot have them scrambled. Yes, this is true. Something about not having enough pans in the kitchen.

I know brunch is new for them but this service was SO far off they should have waited to have more things in place before opening to this mess.

Since the food is good I hope they get things worked out quickly. If they don't -- the only other option for them would be to take down the brunch sign."}
{"text":"Very good dining experience.  Prices expected for the area.  Quality matches with price and was shocked at the quantity of food.  Dined on chicken and short ribs, neither disappointed."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the menu at all. Burgers and hot dogs? One of our guests wanted vegetarian and the ONLY option was a veggie burger...in 2015!. Wine list is trying to impress with all the high end wines but very little in the mid range and almost nothing from regions other than US France and Italy.  With all the places to eat around here this one is a complete pass."}
{"text":"Delicious food worth the price. You get a good size portion for the price and an added feature while we were there was the live jazz band they had. The ambiance of the place was amazing and a perfect place to start our girls weekend. The jazz band was even playing some covers from Drake, Bieber, Alicia Keys, and even TLC waterfall! If you're in the area definitely check this place out. We had no wait time and didn't have reservations."}
{"text":"Never written a review before.... But here is one from my dinner tonight! Went for a burger before a game. Sounds fun right?The only place with room was this restaurant... Now we know why. $27 for a burger... the worst burger ever. Firstly the burger arrived in 1 minute. I kid you not. Was it pre-made? Seems so... Dry bun. Flat burger. (Not fresh or homemade or moist) A crappy over cooked burger. Topped with super thick bacon which was undercooked.... long story short I didn't eat mine. Told the server I didn't like it. No apology. No small discount. Paid for it anyway. Never going back to this place. Awful. Don't waste your time or money. Wait in line at the several other options within walking distance of the ACC."}
{"text":"Nice ambience. Great menu selection 
Just wasn't too thrilled with the service 
Had to ask for the waitress twice and it wasnt even busy"}
