{"text":"Fried Chicken sandwich and onion rings massive portion looks impressive but sadly there was very little taste... but grease."}
{"text":"Went with the family and ordered the cubano, fried chicken sandwich, Italian beef sandwich, poutine, and the kale salad. First off, the sandwiches were phenomenal and the ingredients used were extremely tasty and top notch! The poutine was also excellent! Found out they actually make their fries from scratch every morning! Lastly, the kale salad was truly wonderful... very crispy and fresh. Overall, I could not have had a better experience. The service was attentive and the food is definitely some of the best in Toronto! I highly recommend this place to anyone who appreciates quality food and service!"}
{"text":"My wife, son and I had lunch/brunch here recently. We had a couple of their brunch options and a grilled cheese. Everything was fantastic. The service was attentive (my coffee was regularly refilled) and the food was prepared quickly"}
{"text":"Wow. The chicken sandwich seems to get larger each time we go! The sandwiches here are excellent. The Kale salad is excellent. The fries are excellent. This place is the freaking bomb. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"May very well be the best sandwich shop in Toronto. Yep, I said it.

Went with my female friend on a late Sunday and ordered the porchetta with an Ace Hill pilsener and the large arugula salad. She split the salad with me and had the piri piri chicken sandwich and some LC ale but can't recall the name. sandwiches are more or less $10 a pop and the tallboys were 6.5 each.

Girl taking the order was a sweetheart, very engaging and informative. The design is nice and chill, the music was very a solid and eclectic mix of chill lounge, hip hop, and rock. 

The food was off the chain good. My friend agreed fully. You wait 10 mins for the order because it's made properly. The ingredients are uber fresh (aioli and porchetta is insane good) and the portions are solid for a guy who works out but doesn't want unnecessary filler in his system. I had a bite of her piri piri chicken, which featured a thick chicken breast, and having stayed in Africa for a long time I know proper piri piri and this is a milder version of the traditional Mozambican or South African version, in a good way.

When a meal is so good you order the buttermilk chicken (huge sandwich btw) to go and then eat it at 1am you know the place is spot on. East York needed a joint like this and don't be shocked to see a few of these pop up across T.O. over the next year or two."}
{"text":"Great, fresh and flavourful food. Fried chicken sandwich was amazing - sweet and savoury. Poutine was just right! Also, was surprisingly fast."}
{"text":"My husband, 11 month old and I went for lunch today at about 11:30am. When we got there a couple of people were there picking up. Based on the server's recommendations we got the fried chicken, onion rings, my husband was set on the shrimp po-boy so he ordered that. My fried chicken sandwich and the onion rings were epic. The batter on both were perfectly seasoned and not overly greasy, amazing and so delicious. There are about 30 seats and they serve beer. No highchairs that I saw. Free parking in front on Sundays and there's always free street parking in the neighbourhood streets."}
{"text":"A very welcome addition to the area and a great lunch spot. Been there a few a times, I've had the vegetarian sandwich and the po boy, it's consistently good, which is very nice. Their food is also different from anything else in the area, so it's a great quick lunch spot which leaves you feeling satisfied. Had the onion rings too, couldn't finish them all because they were pretty heavy, delicious nonetheless. I hope they stick around!"}
{"text":"Great place for hot sandwiches (FINALLY)!!!

Tried the beef brisket sandwich. The sandwich was very filling and the brisket was tender and flavourful! The arugula and the horseradish aioli were not over-powering and complimented the meat well. The kaiser was soft and nicely toasted. 

Had this sandwich to-go and it held up well during transportation. Dunno what kind of sorcery this is but, the bun didn't get soggy which is always a bonus!

Can't wait to try the shrimp po'boy and poutine next!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich place here in the East end! Ordered from UberEats far too many times to count. I order the portobello sandwich bc I am a vegetarian so my only compliant about that would be more options please :) I have ordered the fries a couple of times, however, unfortunately they come in a parchment like paper bag so they are usually soggy, and the gravy is inconsistent. I had it once and it was thick, flavorful and SO good, however, all the other times it was severely watered down."}
{"text":"The fried chicken sandwich was amazing! Big enough to hurt your jaw without making a giant mess. The flavours worked really well together and the chicken had a delicious, crunchy batter. I will have dreams about that chicken for a long time! 

The pulled pork poutine was also really yummy. The jalapeños were a nice touch. Fries were fresh and they used curds (bonus points for not using shredded cheese). 

Prices are comparable to a cheaper sit down restaurant than a fast food place, but the quality of the ingredients, the taste, the presentation and the atmosphere definitely live up to the cost and then some!"}
{"text":"I had the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and it was amazing. The flavour was awesome and the chicken was nicely breaded and moist. The sandwich was also huge. I could barely finish it but I had to because it was so good. For the size of the sandwich and the quality, the price is really good too. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very good fried chicken sandwich. Light breading. Tasty moist chicken.  
Aioli was a little bland but helped not to over power the taste of the chicken. 
Chile is flavourful. Onion rings are light crispy.  
Will definitely go back.  Friendly service"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great! I noticed a lot of people commenting on the price $10-$12 for a sandwich but I don't think they are taking the quality of the food into account. They make everything fresh with really high quality ingredients and it is delicious. For me, the sandwiches are huge and a side of fries is good to split with someone else. It's a nice, relaxed atmosphere with friendly staff. It might be more expensive than fast food restaurants but I don't think this place qualifies as fast food. I've tried the grilled cheese which is amazing (on sour dough bread and the cheese is caramelized on the outside). The porchetta sandwich is amazing especially with a fried egg on top, the meat is tender and the toppings are perfect! The poutine is also excellent (and huge) they make their gravy in house (and their hot sauce) all so good. TRY IT!"}
{"text":"Had the butter milk chicken sandwich along with the bacon green onion poutine.  Both very good, would recommend if you're in the Coxwell and O'Connor check it out. Great service, very friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered here twice and this place can be summed up easily. Food is GREAT, portions are TINY, and prices are HIGH.  This time I ordered the Cuban sandwich, mainly because where is a Cuban sandwich ever small?  Answer: here.  I literally finished it in one minute. Was it delicious?  Yes!  And that is what is so frustrating.

Now I also did order onion rings, so maybe that would satiate me?  It might had I received more than a total of 5 - yes FIVE - small and medium sized onion rings for $4.  Really, how much does an entire onion cost?  25 cents?  Well here that single onion is enough for probably 10 orders of onion rings folks.  Again they were possibly the most delicious 5 onion rings I've ever eaten, but who cares when there are only 5? 

My wife had the fried chicken. Again, delicious, and maybe you could say this was borderline medium sized but for what you're paying I really need more here.  She almost never finishes food at a restaurant and she did so easily here.

Very frustrating because the quality is there, and I live minutes away so I'd be a genuine regular here if I could get a decent sized sandwich and side here for $15 or $16. As it stands I'd need to order two sandwiches and 2 sides and spend $40+ for a proper sized meal. As a result I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Finally, a restaurant that clearly takes pride in quality ingredients which seems to be rare these days. This place definitely resonates with what I'm about. High quality, clean, delicious meals that leave you feeling good. 

I love that fact that these guys source pretty much everything locally. That's a big deal to me. Gotta support the community. 

As for the food, I'm a huge fan of the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. So much so that I can say that I prefer this one to what I've eaten at Porchetta & Co.

The actual porchetta sandwich that's offered at Knuckle Sandwich is top notch as well. Definitely my fave thing there when you add a Fried egg to it. Something about that salsa verde that just works so well. 

The salads were exceptional as well, however I'm more of a fries kinda guy. I'm always getting the poutines at Knuckle Sandwich and they are hot damn delicious. That gravy tho... Oh lawd. 

Beer selection here is on point. The gentlemen running this joint have a vision and I'm liking everything about this place. Speaking with one of the owners, you could tell they are always trying to make everything from the food, to the overall experience better for the customer. 5 star. Well done."}
{"text":"Best thing they have is the fried chicken sandwich. The poutine is decent too. Had a few other sandwiches which were just average."}
{"text":"I had the Shrimp Po'Boy and my partner had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken sandwich. We shared some fries. Not going to say much except, fresh ingredients, great flavours and huge size sandwiches. Epic tastes! Will return to try other sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place - the menu, the atmosphere - is a lot like Sully's on Gerrard. 

I've just tried it for the first time. The buttermilk fried chicken sandwich was very good. The fries were good too but just a bit salty for my taste. Service was a little brusque. 

All in all a nice addition to the neighbourhood and it definitely spruces up the retail strip on Coxwell south of O'Connor."}
{"text":"Fabulous new sandwich shoppe. I use the old school shoppe because the food was so good it deserved the extra cred. I dared to try the brisket because I loathe brisket. I figure if I enjoy a sandwich I normally dislike then imagine how good the the other choices would be? Well???? I'm a brisket fan. The meat was tender and lean. The sauce was very tasty with just the right drip....I managed not to wear any haha. My wife loved her buttermilk chicken was fantastic and I tried it so I know it's true. We also split a ceasar salad which may be the best I've had in quite some time. Good choice of locally brewed beer as well and the people were kind and friendly. Look forward to my next meal there. Thank you all/for a wonderful experience!!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches.  The fried chicken is the best in the city as far as I'm concerned. They also have a nice selection of craft beer if you're dining in."}
{"text":"Was so excited to see a \"new school\" restaurant show up on the coxwell strip. Ordered brisket and fried chicken sandwiches, fries and gravy with a partner. Pros: the gravy was sensational and the first bite of the fried chicken sandwich was heaven. Cons: price was a bit much for the quality of the brisket. The brisket was decent, but not overly impressive. It was missing the something special that was in the gravy. Will definitely come back to try their poutines and onion rings because rocking that gravy ups the potential.  The strange part is i would have given it a higher rating if it was more affordable. $30 for 2 sandwiches, 1 fry and gravy is a bit much. Love that these places are entering the neighbourhood and hope they evolve to mind blowing."}
{"text":"Based on a takeout order. I got the fried chicken sandwich and onion rings. The Chicken Sandwich was only OK. points for a nice soft bun and portion size-- it was pricey still but moreso I wasn't a big fan of the toppings. They put a slaw on it, but it didn't really compliment the chicken. I thought it could be more vinegary and less sweet. As well the cut sizes on the slaw were really inconsistent. I got some giant pieces of cabbage in mine. It basically all fell out while I was eating it so I only really ate a bit of the slaw. The chicken was good, cooked and seasoned well. The sandwich could have used some sauce, I think mine all soaked into the bun but I probably wouldn't have minded if the slaw was more flavourful. The onion rings were good. Yes, they are greasy, but that's what I want if I'm ordering beer battered onion rings. They were definitely the best part of my meal. Would order again but I would try a different sandwich."}
{"text":"Seriously the best sandwiches and softest bread ever. I've been 3 days in a row. Both chicken sandwiches and the braised bee. Are AMAZING. so is the French onion soup! Love it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I've literally been here everyday since it opened. The food is awesome, service is great, beers are amazing, and it has a really chill vibe. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Every thing was fantastic! Cute and well laid out space and fantastic food. My fiance had the grilled cheese sandwich with Sriracha ketchup, I had the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and we shared the bacon poutine. We sat right by the food window and I was dying waiting for my food. Parking situation is street parking, one of the better that I have seen since moving here. Wifi is locked."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, because the sandwich ideas sounded great, but it was awful. From the confused waitress who couldn't remember things about the order, didn't know the menu, and really wanted to take our food away before we were done, to the expensive prices that include only the sandwich, to the sandwiches (fried chicken, porchetta, bacon grilled cheese, grilled chicken) that were incredibly bland, to bill mistakes, and the flies all around the restaurant. This sucked. I don't know how they manage to make a sandwich with those ingredients and have it be so incredibly bland. Truly a culinary achievement."}
{"text":"Great find! Rustic clean look and friendly/attentive staff. We shared the fried chicken sandwich and grilled cheese. Both were exceptionally good. Chicken could have had a crisper coating but toppings and bun made up for it. Grilled cheese was fantastic."}
{"text":"I like service at the table and take out at the counter.   Other than having to place my order like I was at pizza pizza it was delicious and had amazing sandwich combinations.  Service was friendly and they worked efficiently to manage eat in customers and people taking thier lunch out.  Would come back for lunch next staycation day!"}
{"text":"I got the poutine and chicken sandwich. Both were excellent! I found it a bit odd how you order/are served here (like a fast food chain style, vs. typical restaurant), but I would absolutely come back for the food."}
{"text":"Im not exactly sure how to rate this place,  the food was partly good, I had brasied brisket, the meat was tender and good but it  just rest of the sandwich i wasnt to keen on. I get that might be a healthier verison of sandwich but i dont know it was the arugla, the sause or pickled onion that bothered  me the most. I dont think it a bad sandwich it did taste good but something in that mix was off for me..... this doesnt mean im eliminating them from my list

Still got to try to buttlermilk chicken"}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches. We had the chicken and fennel, and fried chicken.  They were both tasty, and super messy."}
{"text":"There is a significant difference IMHO between good fast food, and good food fast.

Knuckle sandwich fals into the latter category, which is the one I prefer.

A decent selection of good sandwiches ( and not of the deli meat variety) and a few other options like salads etc.

We ordered the cheesesteak and the chicken tortada, both of which were a good lunch size, large enough to date, but not so large as to result in an afternoon food coma. Nice flavours in both, and the buns where robust enough to support.

Also had the fries as a side, again good portion for sharing between two, and they seemed to be twice fried just to enhance the goodness ...

Also a nice patio facing the street, although that season now seems to be over for the year, too bad we didn't come here earlier in the year.

In and out in less then 40 minutes without any sense of being rushed, and that was a noon on a Monday."}
{"text":"First time trying knuckle sandwich I had a buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and my fiancé had the porchetta sandwich and we shared fries and the lager  gravy. 

The chicken sandwich was delicious the chicken was crispy and so juicy on the inside, the combination of the slaw and chicken complimented each other so well I was so sceptical about it but I'm so happy I tried it.

The porchetta sandwich was also delicious also it had a great pesto on top of the porchetta the porchetta pieces were very tender and sandwich was very put together. 

The fries were good I probably will ask them next time to cook them a bit longer only because I love fries that are really really crispy. The Gravy had a good kick to it worth the try. 

Overall i would recommend this place and will be going back."}
{"text":"Was greeted with friendly service. This place is not the cheapest lunch if you order sides and a drink. Fairly small restaurant with big taste and size on their sandies.

I ordered the fried chicken sandwich, it easily goes in a top 5 fried chicken sandwiches I've ever had. Crisp, fried to perfection, the sauce, the bread, it all works. I think next time the sandwich alone will be enough. I also got a side of fries which were a little over cooked and too crispy for fresh cut fries, but they were good nonetheless.

They had Ace Hill lager which was delicious, would definitely get that again.

Overall a solid place for sandwiches and would return for their brunch menu or to try their other offerings. Based on price ($26 for lunch) and the over cooked fries, they lose a star."}
{"text":"I would like to update that the business owner reached out to me to apologise for my experience and even offered a free meal or a refund which I didn't expect.

Though my experience still stands, I definitely appreciate this gesture. My original review was not to discourage anyone from going to Knuckle Sandwich, I was simply being honest. The level of customer service provided was great and that is the sole reason for the 3 star rating. 

I will add that my boyfriend seemed to enjoy the food just fine so it easily could have been a one time mishap. The sauce on the sandwich did taste quite good but it was difficult to judge flavors when I began feeling sick. 

Again thank you to the business owner for reaching out!"}
{"text":"Me and my fiance decided to check this place out due to the good reviews, and the fact that they are fairly new.

Came at 5:30PM on a weekday and around 6PM, the place got busy pretty quickly.

I ordered a grilled cheese ($6), and my fiance ordered their beef brisket sandwich ($9.50). We also got fries ($3.50)

Beef Brisket sandwich - is a must try! The beef was sooooo tender and juicy, and the meat was delicious! My only complaint is that the price is a bit on the expensive side, it's almost $10 for an average-sized sandwich.

Grilled cheese - for $6 the grilled cheese is huge, and I found this delicious as well. The cheese was nice and melty and wasn't too sweet. The bread was thin. I did enjoy the grilled cheese. It tasted great.

Fries were tasty and not too salty.

We enjoyed all the items we ordered. Wait time is at least 15 mins but the wait is worth it. We got bored waiting, so we asked for their wi-fi password in which the server was happy to give. Password's their phone number.

Over-all this is a good place to try one-time. Prices are a bit on the expensive side for the amount of serving you get.

Review 64 of 100"}
{"text":"I'm torn between 3 or 4 stars because the food is pretty good, but felt incredibly overpriced. $4+ for 4 onion rings? $12 for a sandwich with no sides.

The food was good for sure, but perhaps a bit above my price range. I'm also not fond of how you pay upfront. It means that if you order anything else afterwards, you have to pay for it separately, etc. Also, isn't it weird to provide tip before the food has been served? If you enjoyed service, you don't have the chance to leave a higher tip."}
{"text":"Tried this place out a couple weeks ago. Food was amazing! Really big portions. Unique concept and menu. Only down side was there was no AC on but they do have a small patio so that makes up for it. Glad to see this place in the East York area."}
{"text":"Walked in and looked at the Menu board, had a difficult time deciding. Even though the menu is limited there is a good variety and multiple combinations of items to choose from. The cashier who happened to be the owner, George, was wonderful in explaining the menu items and helping me choose. 

Hubby and I had the following:

Fried Chicken Sandwich - This is a massive sandwich! The chicken hangs over both ends of the bun. Nice and crispy, crunchy batter and the chicken is tender and juicy. You definitely get your money's worth with this one because you won't even need any sides to get full. I cut it in half and ate it for dinner later and the outside was still crunchy.

Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich - They cook the roast beef rare then dip it in the au jus which cooks it all the way; it's on the bland side. Next time will ask for the au jus on the side so the bread doesn't get soggy. Should also order a side of one of their aiolis (basil, garlic, chipotle) and or use their Sriracha ketchup.

Butternut Squash Soup - owner said it had a Thai twist. Savoury and delicious, you can taste the coconut milk and ginger.

Kale side salad - if you like kale (hubby hates it) you will love this salad. The paper thin, crispy prosciutto on top was scrumptious!

Fries with Sriracha ketchup - weren't oily but a bit dry, the Sriracha ketchup really helped make it a tasty side.

Owner, host, server (same person) and kitchen staff were hospitable, sweet and attentive.

Warning: the street in front is a very busy street and the only way to park is diagonally and head in. I would recommend coming with a friend to help you spot cars while you back up, or take the bus. Also according to Evo X there's free 1 hour parking on Lankin M-F 9a-5p if you don't mind the walk."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I stopped by Knuckle Sandwich.  I wasn't sure what to expect.  Was it just take out, more like a Subway?  Or something more formal?  It's a fun, lively place where you order at the front counter, pick out your own drink from the cooler (soft drinks and a selection of beers) and they'll bring your meal to your table.  We had a shrimp po'boy and a chicken sandwich.  I don't think I've ever seen a po'boy sandwich in a Toronto restaurant, but this shrimp po'boy was just as good as any po'boy I had on a holiday in Louisiana.  The chicken sandwich was delicious with nice, fresh and crunchy toppings.  Lots of sides to choose from.  We chose tater tots because, hey, who doesn't love tater tots?  I was stuffed by the end of the meal.  A great lunch and terrific service.  Lots of customers so it looks like they're doing a good business.  And fun, indy music in the background.  I could tell that all the other customers around me were just as happy with their meals as I was.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Small sandwich place with many flavorful options. Food was really good. I had the spicy fried chicken and danforth fries, it had a nice kick and the flavors went well together. My partner had the original fried chicken sandwich and the poutine, which he devoured. The original sandwich compared to the spicy had a sweeter finish due to the garnishing; whereas, spicy had a savoury taste. The poutine was also good, different then normal poutines, the gravy had a different taste but still very good. Would definitely reccomend  and come back and try the other menu items."}
{"text":"We decided to check out this place after reading all the reviews here. 
The food is really good, especially the fried chicken. Not too crunchy and juicy enough. The Porchetta is a bit on the dry side, but all saved by the amount of salsa verde. The Brisket is 'OK' I would say. Huge Onion Rings - only 4.5 pieces in total. 
Overall I think the portion with the food is abit small for this price. 
Great service from the lady though. After she heard we are sharing all the food, she offered to bring everything back to the kitchen and portioned the sandwiches for us.
Some street parking right outside of the place too. And free after 6PM."}
{"text":"You know you're serious when you eat a sandwich for dessert! That's exactly what I did after getting my pho fix across the street at the Little Coxwell. There's something about this space that just caught my attention and lured me in. I often tell people I get this tingly feeling about an epic meal time and I was feelin' it.

I had read about this space on BlogTo and let me tell you they did not do them enough justice. I've read all about their story; two locals boys returning to the neighbourhood that shaped and molded them into the determined(to succeed) entrepreneurs they are today. They've returned on a mission to give back to the community that has given them so much. These guys know the importance of community and support it by sourcing as much ingredients locally as they can such as their protein which they get from a quality butcher down the street. They even have local craft beer; a perfect pair for your sandwich.

One taste of this stuff and you know these guys are passionate about their craft. Every bite exudes quality and finesse that one does not come to expect from a sandwich. From that incredibly tender piece of fried chicken to the perfect amount of sweet and tangy sauce even down to the tiny charred corn kernels; no detail is overlooked. The result is by far the most delicious fried chicken sandwich that I have ever witness.

This place is an absolute gem!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn yummy! I ordered the fried chicken sandwich that was fantastic; I loved the honey, the aioli and the bun. Also ordered the onion rings they were crispy and well seasoned but I am sad to say very greasy. I will get the fries or a salad next time, they looked wonderful."}
{"text":"I went there because of the reviews.  I thought the sandwiches had great flavors and seasoned well.

I ordered the fried chicken, brisket and porchetta and shared them with other folks. The fried chicken was the best one.  

  I would have like to given it a better review but two things could be improved.  1) need more meat!  For a 10 buck sandwich you want to be satisfied.  2) the price.  Perhaps lower the price so that I can order two of them to get my hunger quenched.

I saw similar comments about the price.  I'm glad I went and tried but not too sure I would go out of my way to go again.  Try it if you are in the HOOD."}
{"text":"the brisket poutine was really good (if a little too salty at the bottom) and the service was really friendly. really good prices!"}
{"text":"Cool spot and the staff was super friendly.  Nice range of local beers and they were accomodating of my vegan GF, which is always great and can't be counted on.  The chicken sandwich was $10 bucks with no sides so it's not cheap, but it was great, as was the kale salad.  But the onion rings may have been the greasiest I've ever had ... my GF found her fries a bit greasy too ... issues with the frier?  

Half a star off for the greasiness, but everything else was good - nice new East York spot."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. My new fav sandwich spot. The restaurant is a smaller size, which creates a nice intimate setting. Excellent customer service. Fresh local food. Fried chicken sandwich is incredible. Danforth fries are so good. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really great sandwiches! 

Tried the porchetta and the fried chicken and both were fantastic. The porchetta came with a salsa verde and grainy mustard, and it balances out the rich, fatty meat really well. Even better, though, was the fried chicken sandwich - the chicken is crispy, but not too crunchy, and perfectly tender (it was a chicken thigh, not a breast) and the poblano slaw and sweet chipotle honey complement it really well. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So I was super excited to try this place but was not impressed. The place itself is nice and the people / service friendly but the food was average.  We had a grilled chicken Sandwich, poutine and onion rings.

The Good
The beer battered onion rings were yummy.
They serve beer(canned only)
They have a lovely little patio

The Meh
Sandwhich was below average and lacked flavour.
Poutine - gravy had a strange texture.

Not sure I would give this place another try."}
{"text":"I also checked this one out due to great reviews. I had the friend chicken sandwich, overall it didn't impress and a bit underwhelming. I think it needs a more flavour for my liking also the price is quite high for the sandwich."}
{"text":"Great spot on Coxwell near O'Connor.

Everything is made in house -- sandwiches, salads and some great sides.
Lots of good looking local micro-brews on tap.
Friendly staff who really know their fare.
Pretty casual -- you order from the board, pay, and then take a seat. 
They bring it out to you when ready.

We had the Chicken Sandwich -- so flavourful and topped with a great slaw!  Hubby had fries and I had the tater tots as sides (talk about a blast from the past and great!).
They make their own ketchup and have a spicy version too which went great with the tater tots.

The food was great quality and I totally recommend if you are looking for a more casual lunch.  Think I might have to try the Shrimp Po'Boy next time or perhaps the Steak and Cheese Sandwich. :)"}
{"text":"Went in 7ish for a bite to eat after work, picked up an Arugula salad for the wife and I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy and basic Poutine all to go.

The large salad was $9.00, opened the box to find there was some Arugula leafs with around 5 small pieces of goats cheese and maybe the same amount of walnuts, the salad dressing was....well....lacklustre, overall, very disappointing .

The Shrimp Po boy had a lot of fresh veggies in a toasted bun, however, I know why it was Po, they only had shrimp placed on the edge of the sandwich and they were very bland.

Finally, the Poutine, I saved the best for last, great fries and gravy, again, could have used some more cheese curds but the overall taste was excellent.

Nice to see a new establishment in the neighbourhood, hope they make the much needed changes in order to succeed."}
{"text":"We ordered the porchetta sandwich, special of day spicy chicken sandwich and poutine. 

Really like the spicy chicken sandwich, it definitely got some heat and crunchy on the outside and juicy inside.

Poutine was quite interesting, I really liked the gravy."}
{"text":"This is a great local place that we've never noticed until we scanned our area on Yelp for a place to eat. We got the take out option, which is fairly common here. The food is creative and it's definitely a place we'd come back to.

The sandwiches and poutine are fairly good. The onion rings were huge, but had a stronger curry scent that we weren't crazy about. But it's definitely a local place that everyone in the area should hit up!"}
{"text":"Saw that there was a new place in the neighborhood and decided to try it out. They did not disappoint!

Had ordered the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and a classic poutine to go.

The buttermilk fried chicken sandwich was excellent! It was very light and was not greasy at all! Will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu.

As for the poutine... It was soggy and nothing special. Will be back to try the onion rings."}
{"text":"Great new sandwich joint on the Coxwell and O'Connor strip! 

Came here for dinner with my partner on a Sunday evening.  The restaurant is casual, has a fair number of tables and seats for individuals or small groups, with a few bar stools by the window.  A large wall menu is on the right as soon as you walk in and you order/pay first and then sit down for your food to arrive.

I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich which was delicious, crunchy from the slaw and crispy chicken, and very flavourful. My partner ordered the beef brisket sandwich which was also flavourful. Both were $9.50 each, which is comparable to other burger/sandwich places. We also ordered fries and onion rings on the side which were crispy and delicious with their Sriracha ketchup! Salads are also available on their menu.

I'd definitely come back whenever I'm in the area again to try their poutine and other sandwiches!

Public street parking is available from Monday to Saturday; free street parking on Sundays."}
{"text":"Dropped in this evening after dining across the street last night & was intrigued by the decor. I didn't realize that the ever changing Thai restaurant spot had become a sandwich joint.

The restaurant was empty when we got there, but filled up by the time we left. We ended up ordering the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich, the porchetta sandwich & fries. Both sandwiches were delicious. Both portions were decent & the fries were probably some of the best I've ever had. We also got a garlic aioli dipping sauce, which was okay. 

We both also got Lost Craft beers, which are local to Toronto. Great selection of beers available, but only in tall cans. They gave us 2 red plastic cups to drink these out of. Hopefully they'll invest in glasses for next time.

Overall, I would probably return. In comparison to places like Porchetta & Co., the prices were about the same but the portions were smaller. The quality of the food is on point.

Definitely hope Knuckle Sandwich sticks around (tell all of your friends). Just get rid of the red plastic cups."}
{"text":"I want to try all their sandwiches!  I had the porchetta sandwich based on their recommendation for a \"neater\" sandwich and there was so much meat in it, which is great because it's $9 for the sandwich.  Despite its size I was able to scarf it down one-handed while pushing a stroller so bonus points on their recommendation, and I will definitely be back to try their sandwiches and more importantly, poutine!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Knuckle Sandwichn was closer to when it opened, before they changed their menu. At the time I had the Porchetta sandwich and got an egg on top. It was great. Any sandwich with an egg on top is great. Well, as long as it's a runny egg.

The menu has changed since, and the Porchetta is no longer on the menu. I like that they are a sandwich shop that switches things up, so I don't mind. I think the fried chicken sandwich has always been on the menu...

This time I got the butter milk fried chicken sandwich. It was a pretty delicious sandwich. I would get it again. The sandwiches might be a little pricer than some other sandwiches in the area but they are definitely a good size. I'm feeling full and I didn't even get a side with it. And if they are using ethically raised meats than it all adds up. Speaking of sides, I am curious to try their poutine as it looks pretty good.

Bonus points for being right near the new LCBO on Coxwell."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches at a decent price for the size and quality. 

Ordered the Fried Chicken & Shrimp Po Boy, with a side of onion rings. 

Took just enough time for me to walk from my house when I called the order in. Manager at the cash made sure everything was right. 

Both sandwiches were a decent size. Hit the spot. Great breading, fixings, and dressing. 

Onion rings were on the crispy side. I prefer them a bit softer but they had a nice crunch. 

Stop complaining about the price! It's good food made with attention and quality ingredients. You can tell the chicken is brined because it's so juicy.
I hope they stick around for a while and be a lasting East York joint. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yummy. I had the fried chicken sandwich and it was huge and great. Nice addition to that strip. Lots of families."}
{"text":"My girlfriend suggested this place the other night.. We don't live in the area, but seeing some of the reviews on Yelp, and the post from BlogTO, we wanted to give it a try.  And I'm really glad we made the drive out to this place. 

I had the porchetta sandwich topped with a fried egg and a poutine.  Btw: the portions are very generous! Tons of meat in the sandwiches. So much that the gf was getting full after just 2/3rds of the way through her brisket, so I happily took a couple of big bites to help her out (though, I'm pretty sure I saw her give me some cut eye as I did... She really hates sharing when it comes to good food) 

The quality of the ingredients was outstanding - you can really tell they put a lot of effort into getting the taste just right.

It's not often you come across a sandwich shop that puts so much care into their product.. I highly recommend this one and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich place in toronto. Their fried chicken sandwich is a must try! And the matching poutine is just amazing!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I didn't realize I had been here before for a pickup. The place looks great and although there really is no big concern, the place for me will only be memorable for it's extremely large yet incredibly juicy greasy stomach churning onion rings. Loved LOVED the grilled cheese sandwich but eating those onion rings was equivalent to drinking grease. No thanks! Gross. Nice place though."}
{"text":"Sorry guys, this place definitely wasn't for me. It's a cute joint for sure - polite and welcoming wait staff and that rustic-yet-trendy decor that I'm always a fan of. Still, the food was a disappointment. I'd read loads of reviews raving about the chicken sandwich and our waitress positively GUSHED over the Porchetta. But alas. Perhaps my expectations were too high going in, but I was certainly underwhelmed.

I ordered the Porchetta, a pork sandwich with apricot and arugula on a white bun. The best I can say is 'meh'. It had potential, but the meat was bland and under-seasoned, the kale could have been more finely chopped, and it could have used more sauce. The apricot was a lovely pairing with the meat, but unfortunately there were few on the sandwich. In the end it seemed more like a pile of arugula and pork on a white bun. The bun, which was also a bit of an issue. It was bigger than the contents that it held, so I actually had to eat the dish open-top. The top half also had this odd crispy exterior with a soft inside, and the crunch just didn't work with the rest of the sandwich.

The others I went with the (renowned) Fried Chicken Sandwich, Steak and Cheese Sandwich, and Summer Grain Salad. To start, the fried chicken was a let down. Crispy and unique for sure, but it did not pack the flavourful punch that I expected. The chicken was massive and entirely overpowered everything else on the sandwich, without providing much interest of it's own. Not nearly wowing enough to warrant the hype, in my opinion, and I would recommend just going to a fried chicken restaurant if that's all your looking for. The steak and cheese was okay. Nothing special, but the soft bun and sliced meat went well together. A tasty classic, so though it was good, I wasn't surprised. My only critique there would be the same as before - more flavour. Perhaps a stronger, smoker cheese may have better suited the sandwich, and more spices would have been a good idea.

The highlight, at least for me, was actually the salad. At a sandwich restaurant, this is not a good sign. It was tasty, and everything worked well together. The quinoa, avocado, beans, and chickpeas all mixed quite nicely, and it was a lovely flavour combination with a good crunch in a perfect meal portion. I wished they had a side size, actually, as I would have loved to have had more for myself, and I think it would have been I nice combo considering how meat-heavy the sandwiches are. So that I was impressed by, especially considering that it's a pretty healthy dish. But it's not enough to save the restaurant in my eyes.

In the end, I have to commend Knuckle Sandwich for it's originality and cool environment, but condemn it for it's execution. They need to expand their spice drawer! I'd go back if they seriously overhauled their recipes, but for now it's a no from me."}
{"text":"Buttermilk fried chicken sandwich: huge! Crispy out tender in.  Yummy! 
Porchetta: sweet and savoury. A lil sour taste made it a great combo. Add a runny pan fried egg.. Heaven.  
Food is pretty good in general. Service was good too."}
{"text":"Knuckle sandwich earned 3.5 stars which I have rounded up to 4 because of the staff.

We actually came here primarily for the onion rings because it is hard to find GOOD house made beer batter onion rings.  The rings here are a bit oily but crispy and the onion still has some firmness instead of the usual thin mushy string that slides out when you bite into it.  The batter has a spice we weren't expecting which hubby liked but I wasn't a fan of, but onion rings ain't my thang.

Staff were super friendly and helpful which is always a plus.

We ordered 4 sandwiches to share for dinner and lunch the next day.

The best by far was the fried chicken sandwich.  The chicken was substantial and moist and the toppings and sweet chipotle honey went well with the chicken.  A tasty sandwich we would definitely order again.

Next was the Philly beef and cheese that was the daily special (they have specials on weekends).  It was completely different than any Philly sandwich we had ever had and hubby liked it but I was  very shocked and unhappy with the cilantro inside since I think it tastes like soap!  We were not told there was cilantro so I thought it was arugula.

The shrimp Po Boy had too much pickle because it contained both pickle slices and a remoulade that had capers inside and it all overpowered the tasty, juicy but very mild tasting shrimp.  I might give it another try with just garlic aioli.

The disappointment was the Beef Brisket.  If not for the sauce it would have been completely dry and even with the sauce it was unpleasant to chew and it was very odd to have arugula on this combo.  

We will likely go back the next time hubby is jonesing for onion rings and I am picking up Pain de Mie bread at Mon K across the street.  

I have read some reviews complaining about the prices but they use locally sourced and naturally raised meats which are pricier and worth it in our opinion."}
{"text":"I am not a sandwich person but oh boy the buttermilk chicken sandwich is fantastic.  It is moist and flavourful and melts in your mouth, while still maintaining a little crunch from the fried batter, yet so light."}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich was awful!

Way too hot to eat, NO flavour, way too much fried grissel. 

Walked half way through."}
{"text":"My family, and I decided to check out this new joint that open up in our neighbourhood. When walking into the restaurant; it has a nice warm modern welcoming vibe. I believe there were about 6 tables to dine in. We all had the porchetta sandwich, onion rings, classic poutine  to share. 

We all thought the sandwich was really good but on the dry side. I wish there was some sort of sauce they could add into the sandwich. But the onion rings were soooo good! Overall, I would definitely re-visit and try the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Just happened to be in the area and was looking for something out of the ordinary. Three of us couldn't decide what to et as they all sounded good on paper. So we decided in the chicken sandwich the poboy and the porchetta sandwich. They were all so good I honestly wouldn't know what to order the next time it was that good. All the sandwiches had their own sauce that fit perfectly with them. 

I had the onion soup. It had a hint of rosemary and was exceptional. The poutine was very good and the onion rings were to die for."}
{"text":"Knuckle Sandwich delivers a knockout punch with a menu that focuses on quality meat, craft beer, salads, and sides. Fusion of interesting ingredients and toppings makes each item stand out in terms of flavour. There is definitely a chef's approach to the offerings from the busy kitchen.

The sandwiches are hearty and served at a size that resembles a heavyweight fighter's fists put together. In other words - they're massive. Portion sizes are generous, and the prices correspond with the quality of the experience. A vegetarian option is included in the sandwich lineup, as well as three salads for those looking for a lighter bite.

Must-try items:
Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich
Brisket Poutine

The small diner's interior is set up nicely and the staff provide excellent service. Your food will be brought out to whether you're dining in or taking it to go. Expect about a 5-10 minute wait, depending on the size of your order. The brisket poutine ($7) is topped with pico de gallo and guacamole, packing serious flavour. A buttermilk fried chicken sandwich ($9.5) is worth every penny, and a good excuse to come and check out a heavyweight contender for some of the food in the city's east end."}
{"text":"Had the chicken sandwich, fries and tater tots and they were all amazing. Great sandwich, love the portion of fries and tots and the crispness was on point. Downside was that the Fries and tots were a tad too salty."}
{"text":"Great sammys here. Good beer. Stop in and have a taste! The shrimp po boy did not disappoint. Hope they can keep it going here - good vibes and nice staff"}
{"text":"I had the brisket sandwich it came on a soft round Italian style bun a reasonable amount of meat with horseradish sauce and arugula. It was a perfectly OK sandwich it would fill you up. it was not creative nor exciting for $10 I think I expected something more memorable."}
{"text":"Where have I been??? Such a neighborhood GEM. Fresh, high-quality food with friendly service? Yes, please! 
Hubby and I both had a fried chicken sandwich, but they were different (one regular, one \"hot\" - both DELICIOUS)
We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches we ordered. Good presentation and friendly staff.

It's a small place but the food totally worth it. I recommend it

Best onion rings ever. delicious"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, gave great recommendations for the fried chicken sandwich as well as the poutine. The food was good and we were served quickly. The only issue was the establishment, having a lot of flies inside and a bit hot. If you can overlook that then I feel that you would enjoy this place or do carry out."}
