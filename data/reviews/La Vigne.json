{"text":"Hey Guys: 

I have to send an update to those who are loyal to my argumentative period of reviews. 
La Vigne was unfortunately closed a few months ago. But, in all honesty I have to say with the lack of business over the past few months, I am not surprised. Our brief encounter with La Vigne expressed a desire to \"as I would say\" bury $100 in the ground and save myself the trouble of digesting the experience. 
Anywho, just wanted you all to know I stand by my word and conviction!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I didn't review this last night after an amazing wine tasting hosted by the Chandler Wine Enthusiast group (although it might have been more entertaining).

The food was excellent and I have to say the staff wasn't the most educated on wine BUT they were so helpful, and truly friendly. 

The wine list looked like it mainly focused on French wines, but there were a few California stuck in there too. 

Fun lesson learned: French wine is made to go with food. You won't find many people drinking it as a standalone beverage. The flavors really come out when you compliment it with food. Neat huh?"}
{"text":"this is just a start to a review, as i didn't really get a chance to really go over the menu and wine list.

we ended up here because we had been at ra next door, stuck on the patio b/c their busy friday happy hour forced us outside. it was soooooooooo hot we packed up and went next door. which was a little off-putting, going from a loud, 80s top 40s-playing young, boisterous crowd to a French, white-table cloth restaurant playing elevator music. we were a lot of sweaty, a little drunk and felt very out of place. 

the decor reminded me of mimi's - fake brick and whimsical fake vines and wrought iron and chandeliers. not my taste, or my style, but i can imagine the moms and grandmas EAT IT UP. in fact i saw more delighted, mouth hanging open, oohing and ahhhing by 50+ women in that 20 minutes it took me to finish my beer than i thought possible.

ok, but i have to give this place credit, after knocking its style- and note that everything is authentic. the brick that looks like it's from Thunder mountain railroad is actually imported from europe. the woode framed doors, windows are actual pieces salvaged from old world churches. the chandeliers, same deal.... i'm sure the owner paid a pretty penny for such authenticity, but unless you are told that, you wouldn't know, so... it's kind of a loss, i think.

the menu looked delicious, lots of cheeses and brie and escargo - french fancy stuff. i would like to come back and try the food, and probably will. and maybe my rating will go up then."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of stumbling into La Vigne for the first time with a friend on Memorial Day Weekend.  We were certainly in for a pleasant surprise.  To date we have only had breakfast at La Vigne, but we are very much looking forward to sharing a desert and a bottle of wine sometime soon.

If you go for breakfast, be sure to order a cappuccino with your meal.  The savory crepes and quiche were both fantastic.  My friend shared his french toast and thick bacon.......ummmmm, all good!!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome
Had a crepe and some daily pate and cheeses

However, I didn't enjoy the ambiance.  Just like the other reviewers, I found it to be too old people-ish, especially when its right next door to the trendy, loud RA crowd."}
