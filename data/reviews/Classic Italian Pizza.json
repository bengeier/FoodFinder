{"text":"Oh, man this is good pizza made the way God intended: In a wood fired oven on a crust that is just thick enough to hold up all the toppings. We went on a Friday night and they were completely packed, which means that the oven was having a hard time keeping up with all the orders. I've had pizza at places endorsed by the Rick Steves crowd in Italy, but this place was actually better. It took quite a long time for our food to arrive, but once it did it was pizza heaven. I need to find out when they are not so busy so I can go back the next time I need some Neapolitan goodness."}
{"text":"Hands down the best wood fire pizza I've ever had paired with a cool waitstaff!! Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Ok, so I know good pizza. I am from the East Coast and NJ/NY restaurants know how to make an awesome pizza. This pizza was edible. As some people have mentioned before me, the crust is not flavorful at all.

I was hoping to be have an awesome experience at this place due to the previous reviews, but I was disappointed. The only exciting thing about this place was the waitress, I cannot remember her name, but she was awesome and sweet and knew her stuff. Also, the Peroni beer on tap. Who has that beer on tap here in Arizona? Classic Italian does. 

I do not think that I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Sat down and first thing I notices was price. Embarrassed to walk out I gave it a try to see If any good. Ordered a margarita pizza for it was cheapest. What I got was a cheese sprinkled with basil and that was it.  I questioned that this was not a margarita and all the said was this is the way they make it.  Should change name on menu. 

At any rate the pizza was plain and a little dry.  Also there was no wood oven taste.  Overall we paid before tip $35 for a 12 inch pepperoni and a 12 inch margarita. Two cokes cost $7.  Not worth it and was not very good.

{"text":"The service was great! Brittany was attentive and informative about both the wine list and pizza options.

We had the Spinach pizza add black olives, leave the artichoke. It was very good! Though, I am a fan of more saucy pizzas. 

Expect to order two pizzas to be satisfied between 2-3 people."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have tried a lot of pizza joints in the Valley, and I am originally from NJ ~ mmm, I can still recall the Atlantic City boardwalk pizza from my youth ~ so I think we have a pretty decent base upon which to review a thin crust pizza. Over the years, we've been disappointed with NYPD, Rosati's, Oregano's, and Nello's. Ray's, Lorenzo's, Barro's, and Spinato's were better.

Classic Italian Pizza lives up to the Yelp-hype. CIP specializes in 12\" thin crust pizzas. You get a high quality, slightly chewy yet crunchy thin crust pizza with a well-spiced sauce and top shelf Italian toppings (the sausage was delicious!). The brick oven bread appetizer recommended by previous Yelpers comes with a plate of olive oil and marinara that is great for dipping your pizza crusts into...In terms of portion size, my hubby, his friend, and I split two pizzas and a bread appetizer, and that was enough for fairly large appetites. And, finally, the service was awesome, as was the ambiance. 

In sum, go now, go often... and probably go on a Thursday night, as it seems you'll be seated immediately!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza spot ever. The variety is awesome. The food is delicious. The ambiance is so inviting. The staff is so friendly and attentive. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza for Tempe.  The owner is always there making the dough and preparing all the fresh ingredients himself.  He comes around to the tables making sure that everything is enjoyable.  Decent wine selection as well.  Recommend the asparagus appetizer and the fresh bread rolls, wow.  This is the epitome of an excellent local pizzeria."}
{"text":"CIP is in our neighborhood, yet we didn't go for 4 years. I wish we had found it sooner! We had a classic cheese pie. While we thought it was great, we asked for \"well done\" but it was still a little under. We also had to wait 45 minutes to get it. The taste is still pretty authentic, but the prices are a little high for the size pie you get. We'll go back. It's definitely the best pizza place in close proximity. However, if we're in the area or are willing to drive, Crust's cheese pie is the best in the Valley and you get more for your money."}
{"text":"UPDATE: CIP had to close their location off Baseline early 2013 but it sounds like they will be reopening the Fall of 2013 in the SW corner of Guadalupe and McClintock! 

Love this restaurant! Pizza is wonderful (our favorite is the proscuitto and basil), great wine selection, great staff, and cozy atmosphere. My husband and I always take our out-of-town guests here. 

Tip as of 2/19/2013: They are not open! I called to make a reservation for my extended family, but the line was disconnected. The website claimed they would be open during construction, but they were completely closed. We had to order take-out pizza - definitely not the same!! I hope they come back!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to pizzeria bianco, but i have been to grimaldis. classic italian pizza is definitely comparable or better than grimaldis.  5 stars for the brick oven bread app!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, salad was okay (ordered the gourmet salad...a little uninspired), the bread sticks were fabulous and the pizza (ordered the Diavolo) was awesome.  I love that style of crust, thin with just a little bit of tooth, and the sauce to cheese ratio was on target.  Great vibe and makes you feel like you found a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the first time I had ever gone to Classic Italian Pizza. I was very very impressed by their margherita pizza.  This pizzeria was already highly recommended by my friends.   For a drink, I ordered a red sangria and I could tell that was from a  mix.  I was less impressed with that.  Next time, I will have to order the Valpolicella. I overheard that the area the restaurant is located in will be replaced by condos and they will have to relocate to the corner of Rural and Baseline.  I will still eat dinner there after they move locations."}
{"text":"Not a bad pizza but these little things have no business being worth 17 bucks!!! Sorry, but ill take my business elsewhere for a portion of the cost and have the same quality."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, and had a great meal. Just ordered a regular pepperoni and it was fantastic. I don't remember the name of the appetizer we had, but it was baked bread with a tomato sauce, kinda strong but good. The italian sodas just made the experience better."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! The owner does an incredible job with his menu and  drink selection and has extremely high quality ingredients. Please recognize that this is a cozy and intimate ideal for small parties unless you plan ahead and give them a heads up. To the gentlemen who posted a poor experience because he felt upset that he arrived with 11 people expecting to be seated on a Sat evening without a reservation, I believe this was a little unfair. I'm sorry you weren't able to get seated, but filming a video and posting it is a bit much. I find this place to be excellent restaurant and have brought friends here who want to drive across town to meet for dinner because of how awesome it is. The owner is from Eastern Europe and can appear gruff at times, but that is mostly cultural.  I have slowly become a regular and feel valued as a customer and have personally experienced and seen how he bends over backwards for his customers when he can and he his fair with his table reservations. To any new customers, this place is getting busier because word is out about how great the food is and we regulars know that reservations may be necessary for even small parties especially when they host local musicians (which is another huge plus and a rarity these days) or on Fri or Sat evenings."}
{"text":"The pizzas were ok. It is nice that they had gluten free crust but wouldn't recommend it to someone who has a severe allergy. The server admitted that they can't be very careful. In general, the price was far to high for what we got. I would recommend Mod Pizza for better pies at a fraction the cost. The service was lousy. The server mostly just stood in the corner spacing out while I tried to get her attention. It took the server 20 minutes to get my check and a box for the leftover pizza once we were ready to leave while she stood in the corner staring into space. I won't return."}
{"text":"Anyone who likes this pizza is brainwashed by the great reviews.  We had the caprese salad as a starter, what a joke, the only thing with flavor was the basil.  Then we split a Spinach pizza.  They call that pizza?  Another joke, limp pizza, tasteless and dry tasteless crust.  I thought I was eating the cardboard box from Peter Piper Pizza, which by the way I considered the worst pizza until I tried CIP.  This pizza has no flavor and the chef/proprietor steals from his customers with his highly inflated prices.  Just not worth it, don't waste your money there!!!"}
{"text":"I just left this place with the most outrageously over-priced 12\" pizza I've ever bought. Crust is tough, toppings are minimal. And a 20oz fountain drink (while you wait) costs $3.50...!!
Never again folks."}
{"text":"Was just in Tempe for a bowl game and found this great place thanks to other yelpers. My husband and I loved the pizza. My husband is really picky about this pizza and he raved about it. It is tucked a way but we plugged the address into our navigation system and had no problem finding it. If you are in Phoenix definitely skip the pizza chains and try Classic Italian Pizza."}
{"text":"This is our second visit to Began's Classic. Were here with friends several months ago and everything was very good as I recall. This time we started out with a delicious sweet potato appetizer and a couple of glasses of wine. My wife had the Margherita pizza and I built my own creation. While a little pricey, the pizza was exceptional with a light, perfectly cooked crust. Atmosphere was really pleasant sitting out on the patio. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable...

Great atmosphere great food..

The waitress wasn't the brightest...almost seating us 3 girls by another table with 4 loud girls....once I saw where she was headed I immediately asked to be seated in one of the many other open tables..

Besides that a couple of pizzas and a bottle of wine later...I was pretty much enjoying the good life.."}
{"text":"I had my first dining experience at Classic Italian. Prior to last night, I always had carry out since I lived around the corner.

We ordered the gourmet salad and we all thought the miso dressing just didn't go with this salad. That was the opinion of all 3 of us at the table.

The real reason we went here is for the pizza. Of course, we weren't disappointed. The Toscana was awesome! I ate almost the entire pizza myself. The salami, olives, cheese and crust were perfect!

The basil/garlic/cheese (can't recall the name) was also very good. 

The service was okay. After the pizza arrived, we didn't see the server again to refill our water. The place wasn't very busy, with just a few tables full. 

Want a good homemade, fresh pizza, look no further than Classic Italian!"}
{"text":"What a great hidden gem.  Tucked away in a corner of an otherwise uninspiring strip mall in Tempe, Classic Italian Pizza is my new fave pizza place.  Right away, you walk into another world as you step inside.  Cozy and warm, you would have no idea that you were in a strip mall at all.  But the real reason to drive out to Classic Italian Pizza is the pizza itself.  Try it, you can thank me later."}
{"text":"I was really excited about the idea of this place so close to my house.... But I was disappointed after trying the place. 

When I looked at the menu I was so excited to see they had a diavola pizza! My wife and make the trip to Phoenix to our favorite brick oven place Cibo. The pizza there is well worth the trip but every now and again it just seems like to much distance. So the other night I thought I would try this place since in walking distance from my house. 

I called in my order for a Diavola pizza and it was ready to be picked up in a short ten minutes. I went in side the place to find my self surprised by the nice ambience and friendly waitress. But then things took a turn for the worst. 

The pizza was slightly bigger than a personal pizza and was just about $20!!! When I got home and to eat the pizza I was extremely disappointed with what they call \"Diavola\"! The pizza was not a true Diavola but in stead a sausage and pepperoni with jalapeños. No actual spicy salami, which is the definition of the Diavola. I was so mad at how much I paid and disappointed in the quality that I didn't even finish it.  

Nothing beats a true quality pizza like Cibo. Apparently there is no substitute."}
{"text":"Classic Italian and Miele's are my go-to pizza places in Tempe.  If you blink, you'll miss Classic Italian, since it's tucked in the corner of a sprawling strip mall.  Unfortunately for the owners, I think this might have a lot to do with the fact that it never seems particularly busy.  This is a plus in my book, however, because I hate few things more than waiting to be seated.

The pizza here is some of the best I've had in the Phoenix metro area.  Thin crust, with just the right amounts of cheese and sauce.  They don't skimp on the toppings either.  The pizza is baked in an oven that often leaves the crust a bit charred, but in a good way - think smokey and flakey.  It is, in a word, delicious.  The pizzas are too small for two people to split, but difficult to finish on your own (although I have been known to do so on occasion).  We come here at least once a month.

The best time of year to go is when the weather is nice enough to sit outside, particularly in the \"Fall\" (do we have fall in Phoenix?).  At that time of year, the grape vines that encompass the outdoor area haven't yet been pruned back, which gives the smallish area a certain \"hideaway\" feel that meshes well with the ambiance of the restaurant.  

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We ordered two pizza's and the blue cheese salad for take out on a Saturday night.  I was shocked when we opened the boxes of pizza and the salad to find the topping on the skimpy side.  The salad had hardly any blue cheese and dried cranberries.  I've eaten in the restaurant before the toppings were generous.  For the price of $45 for two pizza's and a salad and poor quality, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, wonderful atmosphere, wonderful food.

I've seen the sign so many times but never had a reason to go. It's so close to my apartment so my neighbor and I went on a random Wednesday night. Classic Italian Pizza is tucked away in the back of an old shopping center. It's cozy inside with huge amoirs of wine in the corner, a large brick backdrop behind the bar and plenty of intimate seating for all sizes of groups. The patio is vacant so we sat there.

Orded the Reisling (so good!), the asparugous & prosuctoo and the Greek pizza. Our watiress was so kind and gave us lots of suggestions. She checked up on us and seemed genuinely interested in making sure we were enjoying ourselves.

Everything we ate was MAGICAL. It was orgasmic good.

I cannot wait to go back here."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in for dinner hearing great things about the old location. We were surprised at the overpriced menu and should have gotten up and left but decided to try it. The place was slow and server still did not get order correct which was just a pizza with pepperoni and ricotta cheese. My husband had the sausage and mushroom and neither of us was impressed considering for two pizzas and an iced tea it was $38 plus tip. We will definitely not be going back!"}
{"text":"Being obsessed with Eggplant, I decided to try the Eggplant Parmesan Pizza. I also love asparagus, so I tried the asparagus and prosciutto.

Both were AWESOME.

I don't know if I'd personally compare it to Pizzeria Bianco... there are just too many differences with the crust.

However, it was way better than any normal pizzeria in Arizona. Although it is a little pricey for my taste... I'd still fully recommend it. 

The pizza itself was very tactfully done for being an eggplant pizza. The eggplant was cut to perfection and placed nicely on the pizza. The eggplant wasn't too thick like I've had at other places... which made it easy to eat, the way pizza is supposed to be. And, on top of it all, it was delicious.

My order came with some bread squares as well, I'm sure it is complimentary since I didn't order it. Although these bread squares didn't come with marinara, they were still warm and fantastic. 

Oh, and then I got the asparagus and prosciutto. Man, that was amazing. The balsamic vinegar made the two a delicious combination.

It seemed like a quaint place, I wouldn't call it large or small. I went around 7pm on a Monday. The bar was completely full but only one or two tables were taken. It leads me to believe they have a pretty good alcohol selection, but I didn't take a look so therefore I am only making an assumption.

This is a really good place for a first date. It is so much more delicious than oregano's. 

Oh, and the brick oven makes the taste of this scrumptious pizza and bread."}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty damn good for Phoenix.

Same thing with the beer selections and the appetizers. We've been here a few times now, and the food has always been out of this world.

Where I am dinging them one star is the service. 

I get that serving is a crappy job, and that you have to deal with members of the public on a daily basis who do not understand the most basic forms of etiquette or social manners that would qualify them as members of the human species. 

But there are simple things you can do as a server to keep things on the up and up with the people eating, and presumably tipping you, at your job. Like when you serve a beer in a bottle, if it starts to overflow before you get it to the table, go get another one. Its not your money, so don't worry about it.

The second star I am taking down has to do with last Friday, August 10th. I understand that from time to time people want to throw larger parties there, but you need to explain to these social megalomaniacs that there are other people eating in the restaurant, and that this is not the local \"Pizza Shack,\" and that running around taking tons of flash photos, bumping into other tables, yelling and screaming, and acting like ass-hats in general is not acceptable behavior. 

It puts me off the idea of ever going back to Classic Italian due to their inability to deal with the crowd of what I presume are birthday revelers. So much so that in thinking about it I deducted another star. I get that they were a big party, but the rest of the tables in the joint added up to more money coming in than this one party would have. Always mind where your bread is buttered Classic Italian. I've been in when its dead, and due to your inability to hand out some crowd control, you can be pretty sure that I won't be there again."}
{"text":"Nice, hole in the wall kind of pizza place, family owned, reasonable prices.  Very busy when we were there, we were traveling in the area and only found this place because of Groupon.  We were glad that we did, it sure looks like many of the locals frequent this place regularly.  

Probably a good idea to make a reservation before you go."}
{"text":"This is the most disappointing dining experience I've had in a very, very long time. Two of my friends that dined with me this evening are also leaving reviews, as it was blaringly clear to not only myself, but to them as well, how bad the food AND service were at this establishment. 

This pizza is truly awful and ridiculously over priced. I was literally shocked at the sad appearance of the pizza when it was placed on the table, especially because it took a so long to arrive (we were there on a Monday with only 2 other small parties in the restaurant, one of which had already eaten) . The toppings looked wilted and old and the first thing I thought was \"that doesn't look right...\" when it arrived. There is little to no sauce on this pizza--so it's probably not surprising that they charge a ridiculous 4 dollars for a small ramekin of sauce, which also took about 10 minutes to arrive at the table, after we requested it after our pizza arrived when
 
 we realized there was essentially no sauce on it. 16 dollars for a 12 inch, thin, sauceless, wilted topping pizza! I really can't get over their audacity for charging that much for such a poor product. I'm not being hyperbolic when I say a 3 dollar frozen pizza would have been more satisfying.

The service was slow an inattentive. We had to ask twice for water and had to hunt down our server to pay our bill.

I'm baffled at the reviews that gave this pizza and place 5 stars. This eating experience left me unsatisfied, bummed out, and truly mad about the waste of money. Please. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and very eclectic European beers. They also have good wine and sangria. Try the bread bites they are a little bit of heaven with the pasta sauce they come with. Oven-fired pizza at its best."}
{"text":"pizza was great but the worst customer service ever. We waited 2 hours for a pizza when the server told us the staff lost our order, that was fine but then 1 hour later we finally got our pizza with no apologies from wait staff or offer of free app or anything. I asked if we talk to the manger and her came over and said were busy what do you want from this. Still no offer apologies just rude behavior"}
{"text":"I dined in the restaurant tonight with several other family members and my experience with dining in was not the greatest. We all ordered salads which were fresh and large portions. The waitress forgot one of the salads and we reminded her and she brought it 10 minutes later. Two people in our party ordered Guinness beer and the beer was stale and flat and the manager wouldn't comp the beer but after again questioning the waitress the manager compensated one beer. We ordered 3 pizzas and a calzone. 2 pizzas came out and the calzone and they were all good quality and delicious and fresh but my pizza never arrived. Also no offering of fresh Parmesan cheese which was odd. We decided not to say anything to the waitress because we had plenty of food but it was very annoying. Also we asked to have separate checks which never happened. I will never dine in again only get take out. It was a huge disappointment and their wasn't any other diners in the restaurant besides us."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to CIP 10/16/09. First I want to say that we had great service. our waitress was always there when we needed something and always brought it to us in a few seconds. 

I don't know how people can say this pizza is anything special or how it can be \"the best pizza in the valley\" because its not, especially for $13 for a 12inch pepperoni. Let me put it this way $13 for pizza, $26 for their cheapest bottle of wine, $7 for an appetizer add tax and its almost $50 for two people. Now the pizza, the crust taste about the same as Tonys, yeah Tonys the $1 pizza from the freezer section at frys. The toppings where great cheese was nice and melted, great flavor and the pepperoni was a little sweet.

the interior would look better if:
1. Put a simple white table cloth on the table. 
2. Get new chairs, that arn't from IKEA. one thing that really bugged me is that the tables where a darker color and the chairs where a brighter kind of yellowish color. Even if they took my first suggestion it wouldn't matter because the chairs are from IKEA. 

other than that the interior was pretty cool, o except the soccer ball and trophy on top of the wine cabinet, which was kind of out of place with everything else.

I wouldn't go back unless the dropped the price, increace the size of the pizza (and not the cost) and fixed the interior things that bugged me."}
{"text":"I really like this spot for pie.   Not a big space and the atmosphere is just ok.   The pies are not cheap and not huge but they are made with quality ingredients.   Personal favorite is the solo misto with the smokey ham and egg.  We LOVE egg on are pizza and add it to the other ones too.  Last night we tried the Greek pie.  I wasn't a fan but my son and husband really liked it.   I'm not a huge fan of white pies.   They have a better then decent wine list for a small joint.   

This place is sort of hidden in a strip mall.  It is worth seeking it out."}
{"text":"Shortly after sitting down at our table, my wife and I witnessed 3 other groups leave the restaurant after they viewed the menu, without ever placing an order.  My wife suggested that we do the same, but I coaxed her into giving the place a try.  Boy, was I ever wrong!
The pizza comes in one size only, 12 inches; and they are all priced pretty 
high for a small pizza.  The waitress recommended ordering an appetizer since the pizza would not be enough food for two.  We ordered the dinner salad at a whopping $7.75, and the (small) italian sausage pizza at $15.75.  The weak instant iced tea was priced at $3.50.  If these prices seem just a little high, its because they are!
Our server was actually quite friendly, and the decor and lighting of the restaurant is easy on the eyes and very comfortable.  However, the quality of the food was just......OK.  The dinner salad was tasty but lacking in variety of ingredients for the steep $7.75 price tag. The pizza toppings were of high quality, but the sauce was pretty much non-existent.  The thin sliced sausage was alright, but not spectacular.  Wood fired pizza normally has a fairly firm thin crust, but ours was completely soggy. 
I guess we have been spoiled by pizza restaurants with much better value for the price."}
{"text":"I went with a friend of mine who is a big fan of Classic Italian Pizza and he didn't disappoint me.

The place is clean and beautiful, the service is great and the food is also pretty good.

The asparagus with prociuto were delicious and the pizza was pretty good.

I don't know about the prices since I was invited.

The place was pretty busy and the random fact is that I crossed paths with some friends that are food aficionados, which make sense since this places is great!

i will go back soon for sure.

Cheers"}
{"text":"I ended up going here today because Spinato's is closed on Sundays & Mondays (god damn you Spinato's, why are you so tasty).  Overall I was impressed with the place.  

The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and cozy, with a very large, wood-burning brick pizza oven viewable from most of the tables.  We walked in right as they were opening so the oven was still firing up, but it was entertaining to watch.

The menu is fairly eclectic, a selection of appetizers, salads and pasta dishes compliment the array of pizzas available.  The pizza selection ranges from your typical pepperoni to mozzarella, basil, and cherry tomatoes, with others containing very traditional Italian toppings.  They also seemed to have a pretty decent wine selection, even though that really isn't my cup of tea.  

The pizzas are thin crust and don't utilize any tomato sauce (at least none that I saw), but were very good even though I'm not a big fan of thin-crust pizzas.  Everything tasted very fresh, which is nice when you're burnt out on Papa Johns.  My only complaint were that the pizzas are a little small (12'' and they only come in one size).  For $17 I was hoping to get a little more for my money, but it wouldn't stop me from coming back.  

Definitely more 'date night' than family-dining.  I didn't see any tables for more than four people and there isn't a lot of room to push tables together.  All in all worth checking out, but I still think I'll head to Spinato's when I want a regular pizza.

One thing to watch out for:  The place is small and tucked into the corner of the strip mall.  So much so that the parking-lot-visible sign is located over an establishment that is now closed.  At first I thought the restaurant had gone out of business, but further investigation proved it was simply hidden."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix. Blows Bianco out of the water without the two hour wait.  Give them a chance, Ra excellent."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places.  The location is understated as it is in a strip mall but it is not a reflection of the quality of food or atmosphere inside.  Great wood fired pizza and wine list.  Its a great place for a casual dinner with family or friends."}
{"text":"I am really surprised by the 3 1/2 stars.  The pizza here is as good as you'll find in Italy, and better than Pizzeria Bianco.  The atmosphere is similar to their old location, cozy, but not too quaint.  The wine list is accessible and great, with a number of unique and interesting choices.  Everything is home made, and absolutely fantastic.  This is in my opinion the best restaurant in Tempe, and one of the best in the Phoenix metro area."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Tempe, brick oven and thin, most authentic pizza I've had in the valley, Incredibly tasty, more 'date night' then 'order out' because of the high price, about $16 for a 12\" (only size available), all the pizza is cooked by this one awesome Bosnian dude who makes all of the pizza, if you have ever tried the pizza over in Europe you will love this place"}
{"text":"the worst pizza ever. pizza dough isnt supposed to taste like Wonder bread, all doughy & sweet.  This place is an insult to Italian pizza.  These people arent even Italian. Just SAD."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza is back and as good as ever!  Began's is bigger, which means less waiting for the best pizza and tiramisu in NA!  Not to ignore the excellent appetizers, salads, wine list or Karlovacho beer!  They're all wonderful as is the friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews and since I live close by, I decided to give Classic Italian Pizza a try.  When I arrived at around 6pm, I was the first person in the restaurant.  My first impression was -why is it so dark in here? My second impression was-why are they so expensive?  

With the exception of the Margherita, White Pizza, and two or three other pizzas, the majority of the pizzas were in the $15.00 to $17.75 range.  While I was going to get the Capriciossa pizza, it was the most expensive pizza on their menu and I was put off at the price. As others have noted, these pizzas can be shared but at 12 inches in diameter, they are primarily for one person. 

Contrary to what some other reviewer wrote, these pizzas do not come with complimentary bread.  The bread was listed under appetizers and if I recall correctly, it was listed at $7.00, which I think is absolutely ridiculous.  On their menu, they also had some salads and they only had 1 desert item-tiramisu-also at the very high price of $7.00.

As for the pizza itself, the Margherita pizza I had certainly was good.  The cheese was excellent, the sauce good and crust pretty good  as well although I think it could have been done just a bit more. Needless to say, while I liked the pizza, I did not find it incredibly fantastic.

At the end of the day, the pizza, while good, was just too pricey.  If you look at other notable pizza restaurants in Phoenix- Humble Pie, La Grande Orange, Cibo, and even Pizzeria Bianco, all of the prices for pizza at these restaurants are less money.  While $17.75 for a pizza might be considered acceptable in San Francisco or New York, I've been around and for Phoenix, this place is overpriced ."}
{"text":"I have really become a fan of this place.  It has a very European feel to it (just get over the stripmall it is in).  Nice quiet atmosphere.  Very good pizza from the wood burning oven.  Excellent unique terramisu and a good wine list that is constantly changing.  The service staff and cooks are very friendly.  We always have a good time here."}
{"text":"I've been visiting this place for 13 years. The old location was small and quaint but the new location is bigger and better. The service can be slow at times, but I've never been disappointed with the pizza EVER!! It's delicious. The bread and sauce is amazing too. All of the salads are fresh and tasty. It's a little pricey, but I think it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. In Phoenix for business and decided to try this place. Tough shopping center to be in with everything closed, but you need to try it. I had the Diavolo pizza, great and spicy!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  The food is fantastic!  The wine is excellent. The service is second to none. Best brick oven pizza I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This old house-turned pizzeria is cute. Though kind of cluttered. The service was very good, though not worth  the mandatory 24% gratuity (we had 10 in our party hence the mandatory gratuity) The pizza was good. Good not great... Not average, just not 'wow'. There are so many boutique pizza joints in the valley, and they are all good, I just didn't find anything unique about Cibo's besides the complex Italian naming scheme. We had a big group and they packed us in to a back room with another large group... That's fine, but the acoustics are horrible and it was very hard to hear or carry on a conversation. Regardless, I'll go back, even if only for a glass of wine and dessert but wait until the fall to enjoy their big outdoor dining area."}
{"text":"lovely. absolutely lovely.

ate here a few weeks ago with the hubby and a friend of ours. we'd just discovered it several days prior(despite the fact that we've been living 2 miles away for 2 1/2 years!).

we sat outside, where the guys ordered a pizza(which they loved), and I had a salad with walnuts and cranberries, whilst enjoying a delicious Czech beer.

in between conversation, sips of beer, and before our food arrived, we nommed on some great, warm rolls with a bit of soft butter; just the thing to whet the appetite.

the ambiance was perfect--intimate, cozy(especially on a cool Autumn night), and quiet(despite being seated amongst several full tables--the conversation was a dim murmur). another plus? fantastic service.

the prices were a bit on the high side, but definitely worth it--and definitely worth a return visit(or two) before we move next month."}
{"text":"The restaurant setting was very inviting and modern. The drink selection is great and there is a lot to choose from. Pizzas were very tasty and everyone in our group enjoyed there pie. The menu is on the pricey side... $18 for a 12 inch pizza with normal pizza toppings. Appetizers were priced in the same fashion and we're small in portion size and unimpressive for the price. I did enjoy my experience at this restaurant and would most likely go back for happy hour."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Phoenix. No 2 hour wait like Bianco and good service. Great Ambiance. Must try the Italian soda :-)"}
{"text":"I came here last week on a Mission.  That Mission was to find a rival for my current favorite pizza at Parlor's, in central phoenix.  We perhaps slipped in to quietly, as were ignored for a good 10 minutes after coming in.  However, the surroundings seduced us into staying, with a huge oven greeting you by a very nicely stocked bar alongside, dark, rich wood interior.  The bliss on our fellow diners' faces and the speed at which their food disappeared gave testimony to the quality of this place

My Prosciutto pizza was absolutely amazing.  A perfect crust, charred here and there but wonderfully firm throughout, yet still having that feeling of lightness I usually associate with pillows as I ate.  The toppings were top notch quality, and they definitely do NOT skimp on the prosciutto- every inch was covered outside of the crust.  Normally this would be very unbalanced, but the high amount of basil, toned down the rich saltiness of the prosciutto.  

My gf loved her 4 cheese pizza, with mozzarella, ricotta, feta and parmesan cheese.  It had a similarly superb crust, and was a wonderful white pizza.  With that said, this garnered less raves from me because of the layer of oil atop it- I did not inquire, but it gave me the impression that they had brushed the top of the pizza with oil before serving, which is something I despise, although to be fair my gf had no complaints.

By the time we had finished our pizzas, we were the last diners in the restaurant, and it was about ten minutes past their closing time.  Huge props to the server for offering us a dessert, which being tirimisu, I could not resist.  And this was a dangerously addicting version.  The least chocolately I've had, which I thought would be a turn off, wound up being one of my favorite renditions of all time, incredibly creamy and not too boozy.  We were told that it was an in-house recipe and I believed them, and approved. 

If I had only had my pizza, and if we had not been ignored after arriving, this would be 5 stars.  We will have to return, and I will try that 4 cheese pizza again and see about how they garnish their pizzas before serving.  Until then, 4 will do, with the hopes that future visits will promote to 5."}
{"text":"Slow service, margarita pizza was a cheese pizza with some basil on top, and even though the restaurant was practically empty they couldn't get 6 pizzas out to the table hot and at the same time. The only saving grace was a decent tiramisu and if you are a soccer fan they actually watch it here."}
{"text":"Best pizza around! Azhar the owner is a friend of mine and is there to greet every customer. Great place for a date or just to hang out with friends. Very comfortable ambiance. The pizza is absolutely amazing. Nice thin crust and the flavors just melt together. They use a wood oven which makes it so much better and the food has a European flare that makes it stand out."}
{"text":"The location is weird it's tucked into a corner of this huge dead strip mall.  Once you get inside though, the atmosphere is very pleasant. It was busy so we sat on the patio because it was quieter, the guy who seated us thoughtbwe were crazy because it was so hot out but anyway, they had real grape vine enshrouding the patio which was prettybunusual and cool.  The food was very good and very fresh. We had only vegetarian items but I hear their meats arevexcellent as well.  Highly recommend if in the area."}
{"text":"What a great find!  I was looking for someplace different to have pizza and this totally fulfilled my craving perfectly.  We had the antipasta to start and it was a great mix of meats.  I would have liked to have more cheese in my antipasta and it came on a cutting board with three half slices of four different types of ham and salami.  For the money it could have been a bigger portion, but it was delicious!  My husband and I ordered the Margherita and the Carnivore pizzas and they were fabulous.  Thin crust, but not super crispy and the toppings were fresh and yummy.  The basil on the Margherita pizza was super fresh, you could smell it as it came out to the table.  Service was wonderful and the atmosphere was casual and friendly.  We will definitely be return customers!"}
{"text":"I always forget to go to Tempes hidden Gem.  I love this place great wine very nice atmosphere.  The pizza are made right in front of you if you are sitting at the bar, fired up in a Brick oven. Great food will continue to go again and again..."}
{"text":"A gem in Tempe. I took my wife their on our first date a year ago. Pizza is fresh and amazing just took some friends and he is from Chicago and he said it was the best pizza he had ever had. I tried the asparagus  appetizer it was great and we also had one of their signature salads."}
{"text":"Awesome, pizza, awesome drink selection. Great job on the ambience given its wedged in yet another strip mall. Staff and service was great and kid friendly to boot."}
{"text":"I went to \"the best pizza restaurant in phoenix\" and this place blew it away in taste, atmosphere, service, and price.  The place is decently roomy yet still cozy with the pizza oven in the background glowing.  The menu has a nice selection and everything I've had there has been fresh and tasty.  They have some unusual alcohols there we cant find anywhere else and I always enjoy their espresso after dinner.  Really pleasantly surprised by this place as it doesn't look like much from the location."}
{"text":"I lived just outside of Venice Italy for the last few years and I have been on the hunt for good Italian pizza. This place has it! This is hands down the best pizza in the valley. The crust was great. Just the right thickness and it had just the right taste of the oven. I have been driving from  pizza shop to pizza shop looking for better and there seems to be none. I would eat here every night if I did not live in the far west valley."}
{"text":"I hate writing negative reviews of local restaurants, but this establishment left me no other option.

Our waiter was terse, inaccurate, inattentive, and disappeared for long periods of time after we requested items from him. At one point, I had to get up to ask the hostess to get sweetener and straws for our table because our waiter disappeared for 10 minutes after we requested the same items from him.

I ended up splitting a pizza with my friend and it was decent. They have some delicious prosciutto, which was about the only positive aspect of the meal. We ended up paying $20 for a half greek/half greek with prosciutto pizza on thin crust. Insanely expensive for the quality and quantity of food. Also, for an Italian joint, they had a pretty sad looking wine list. 

Unfortunately, due to my horrible experience with the wait staff coupled with the overpriced menu, I will not be returning to Classic Italian Pizza."}
{"text":"This is a really yummy pizza place, and people are very nice, but service was slow and food to come out was slow. Great recommendations from the waiter. We saved room for dessert and had the tiramisu, so good! I would give this place more stars if the service was a tad bit better. Cool and cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Still a great place for pizza. Awesome service and great pies. The hatch chili pie is the best"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago but every time I'm in Arizona I seize the opportunity to come here.  It's just that good.  Outstanding food in a unique setting, this place is a real find!  As others have described, it's a \"hole in the wall\" in a defunct shopping center, soon to be moved, but superb every time I've eaten there.  Owner Azhar Began imports all of his specialty foods -- olives, cheeses, sausages, oils, vinegars -- and makes the rest by hand, featuring a delicious dough that crisps to a beautiful finish in an authentic, wood-fired oven.  The pizzas come topped with fresh, high-quality ingredients (if you like garlic, you can get it minced fresh on top!) and a special sauce made from scratch.  And if you don't like tiramisu, it's because you haven't tried it here yet: light yet rich, with just enough espresso and brandy to balance the mascarpone (reminiscent of a fine crème anglaise), but without the greasy texture often found in other restaurants.  The owner himself is someone to meet: a husky, jolly fellow, a refugee from Bosnia who learned how to cook under a Frenchman in a northern Italian restaurant before coming to the U.S.  If you're lucky enough to catch him when he's there, he'll regale you with stories and share his philosophy on life, usually over a glass of wine.  It's a one-of-a-kind experience, something you probably won't find anywhere else, a real bon-vivant who is passionate about the good things in life: great food and great company."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at pretty much everything: great food, wide selection of wines, and warm atmosphere.

I've had LGO's pizza, and this is better. Haven't had Bianco's yet but apparently they won an award for best alternative to pizzeria Bianco.

Will be back for sure, and if I like it again will give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"The bread bites are so delicious I can't stop thinking about them. Perfect texture and flavor. We had a good pizza with prosciutto but I wish it had more mushrooms. The arugula salad was delicious."}
{"text":"anyone comparing this to bianco is simply barking up the wrong tree.  this isnt even close.  ITALIAN pizza isnt covered in shredded mozzerella.  I struggled to find any flavor at all in the pizza. crust was very tasteless.  got a caprese,  tomatoes were hard and pink.   Someone here claims the atmosphere is better than the \"best pizza in phoenix\" I can not imagine who finds this strip mall spot to be inviting. the tile on the floor has been around since the jc penney outlet that disappeared many many years ago.  took one hopur to get two pizzas. service was friendly and nice. i will make the drive to cibo every single time i want pizza even if i lived next door to cip.  And to price this pizzas higher than both bianco or cibo is just arrogant .  If you want a neopalitan style pizza go elsewhere, if you want ny style pizza go elsewhere.  I will not be back, I am quite frankly annoyed that I have been once based on the gleaming reviews. Better than bianco? that is just flat out nuts. we had a 5 year old with us that refused to eat his cheese pizza.  If you happen to stop in look at the pictures of pizza on the wall, they look italian and nothing like the pizza being churned out here.

DO NOT FALL FOR THE 5 STAR REVIEWS WRITTEN BY  OWNERS FRIENDS AND FAMILY!!!! THIS PIZZA IS A 3 ON  A GREAT DAY."}
{"text":"This place is the valley's best kept pizza secret! Well it least it was when my boyfriend and I checked it out in the summer of '09. Classic Italian Pizza deserves every positive review Yelpers give because their pizza is AWESOME. 

I can vouch that the ingredients are fresh just like their websites states:

\" Azhar Began, Chef & Proprietar, hand picks fresh ingredients daily. Cheese and in-house-made pork sausage made from scratch every morning, imported prosciutto, and Toscana salami also available.\"

We love to start off every date night here with the Mediterranean Mix which is Mediterranean Olives and Feta Cheese (7.95) and a basket of Brick Oven Bread served with the house special tomato sauce (7.95). This app spread gets me SO excited for the actual pizza and we don't even talk much while eating it, just make a bunch of MMMMMMMMM sounds the whole time. :)

My Classic pizza of choice is Prosciutto with mozzarella sauce and fresh basil and the now hubby enjoys the four meat pizza pepporoni, ham, salami and sausage. All pizzas are $10.95-17.95.

If you haven't been here yet and you're a pizza enthusiast Classic Italian Pizza is worth your drive to Tempe. Don't believe the negative reviews until you try it yourself! :D"}
{"text":"I love coming here late on a Saturday night for pizza. The location is great, food yummy, and the staff is friendly. I like coming here for happy hour and sitting outside."}
{"text":"i'm glad i was able to find another brick oven pizza place. we ordered two pizzas and it took us awhile to get out of the house, then we got lost and so it was about 1 hour later that i finally picked up the pizza. it was kinda creepy back there, it was totally empty. the pizza was cold and was so-so. i was *hoping* it would be comparable to biancos but no luck. biancos is way better. but this is much better than most pizza places so i hope they stick around."}
{"text":"3.75---my nephew and I went to eat. He loves pizza. Place was fairly busy, we were seated right away. Ordered a small pepperoni and the server recommended four seasons. Came out quicker than expected. The four seasons had prosciutto, tomato, black olives, artichokes, and mushrooms. It was 2 pieces with prosciutto-tomato, prosciutto-black olives, and so on. It was surprisingly good, two things though: place is pricey (40 for us two) and the crust was too soggy. It didn't hold the ingredients well but was very good otherwise. Would definitely give it another shot."}
{"text":"LOVE Classic Italian Pizza. I don't ever really crave pizza, but this is fantastic. My fave is the Sole Mio, which has ham, mushrooms, and a fried egg. It's not on the menu anymore, but they will make it if you ask for it.

Great service, prompt and friendly. Warm, comfortable restaurant. Great place for a date with someone you have been dating for a while. 

The only complaint would be the salads. They aren't terrible, but they aren't amazing either. If you're looking for an appetizer, the Brick Oven Bread or the proscuitto wrapped asparagus is a better option."}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden pizza places with some of the best pizza.  It is very under rated and very good.  It is worth a visit.  Don't be distracted by the weird crappy location of the backside of the retail strip mall.  It is worth it."}
{"text":"This hidden, beautiful, delicious restaurant is exactly why I L-O-V-E Yelp!  Last week the boyfriend suggested we go on a \"date\" and try something new, but preferably in Tempe since that's where we would be shopping prior.  Nothing came to mind, so I browsed Yelp and found Classic Italian Pizza.  It was love at first read.  

Thanks to the prior reviews we were able to find it by searching for the Big Lots sign, and were greeted by a mostly vacant parking lot.  There, in the corner, the restaurant was glowing and inviting.  Upon entering we were surprised to find only 3 other tables full, and this was a Friday night.  Yippee!  No wait!  

We started with the yummy brick oven bread, Caprese salad, a glass of pinot grigio, and Warka (polish beer)....which all came out quickly.  The bread held up to it's expectations - it was the perfect texture of chewy dough and light flavor, brought with a plate of marinara sauce and balsamic.  Next it was on to the pizza - Margharita for me and Pepperoni for the boyfriend.  Both were yummy, hot, and flavorful.  Every table has it's own bottle of olive oil, balsamic, parmesean, and red pepper so we were able to spice our pizza's up just how we like.  Mmmm!

For me, it's not only about the food it's about the ambiance and this place definitely has both.  It's cozy, pleasant, and when you're there you really feel like someone invited you to be in on the secret."}
{"text":"I have now been here twice in one week and that should be all of the review you need.  The pizza is as good as I have had here in the valley and if you go on a weeknight there is no wait and the service is so fast and friendly there is not one thing to complain about.  I have not gone on the weekend so I cannot say if it gets crowded but the place is pretty small.  

They have a lot of varieties of pizza and calzones as well as salads.  I could probably just be sated from the delicious bread that comes with the dinner salad.  I believe it is just small portions of the pizza dough but I cannot be sure.  But I don't care what it is,  it is delicious. 

This would be a great date place, especially on a chilly night.  The glowing brick pizza oven is right in the middle of the restaurant and just makes a place  that is in the middle of a strip mall seem very cozy.

As the other reviewer mentioned they have a great wine selection, some surprising beer choices and a nice covered patio.  I had been in this complex a few times and never even noticed this place so I am glad that I read Joe's review and took the time to find it."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with this place. We drove over to Tempe, to a blasted out, deserted shopping center that looked like it closed due to a depression, and there it was in the corner, still open while everything around it was closed. It's a nice little spot inside, comfortable enough.

This is another one of those places that thrives on the Groupon phenomenon. Prices are jacked up to accommodate a discount. I bought a $6.50 bottle of beer (as one example). My pizza, a sausage pie, came out burned. I know that a good pizza has a \"flame kissed\" look to it, even at top places like Bianco's. But this pie was flame-licked, and there's a difference. I tasted charcoal more than I did sausage. 

The folded and stuffed Calzone was not burned, but neither was it stuffed so full that it's busting its seams which is the way we like it. Lots of air inside this Calzone. I'lll take the dramatically less expensive Calzone at Mama Mia's on Indian School any day over this hot-air filled version.

The service was good, with a very friendly waitress helping us out. She should have noticed the burnt pie, however. If they reduce the inflated Groupon prices, I'd go back when they bring in some reasonable draft beer and start putting more care into their preparation of the food."}
{"text":"I had been to their previous location some time ago and really enjoyed the pizza and wine. I was excited that they relocated to their new home near trader joes as a frequent this shopping plaza at least once a week. My wife and I had dinner there last night and I must say, I did enjoy the food, wine, service, and the new decor, however, our bill came to $60 (with tip) and I just felt the meal was not worth that much. The salads were mediocre, you basically get fairly decent size bowl of romaine lettuce with a few veggies. Dressing was pretty good. The pizza was good, but I seem to remember it tasting better in the old location (see Byron Cs review). Our favorite pizza is Florencias and we typically spend less there. I could even argue, the more casual Velencia's pizza stacks up to this pizza and it is a way better value."}
{"text":"Finally made it back and the pizza was how I originally remembered it.  Got 1/2 margarita and 1/2 with sausage and jalapenos (I can't remember the name).  Anyway, it was EXCELLENT and easily one of my favorite pizzas in the valley.  It could have been a BIT more crispy and not way overpriced but it was excellent nonetheless.  Last time the pizza was soggy but this time they totally redeemed themselves.  I hope to be back soon.

Oh and the prosciutto wrapped asparagus was just eh.  The service was also pretty good/friendly for a Friday night but clearly overworked."}
{"text":"Omg!! Amazing deal on Monday and Tuesday.  Any Dinner pizza and a bottle of wine $25!!"}
{"text":"Went here about two weeks ago on a spur of the moment. 

Presentation (4 stars) - 

Cute little place, very family owned kinda vibe, very welcoming and homey.

Service (3 stars) - 

Service was average. We went on a Friday night and they were pretty full. There was 3 servers trying to handle about 5 tables each, bad business practice. 

Food (3 stars) -

This is the interesting one. We ordered the bread with marinara as an appetizer and a pizza. The bread was pretty good, essentially just garlic bread with pepper and some marinara sauce. The pizza is pretty good artisan style pizza, but small portion for two. We were still hungry after an appetizer and pizza, good lunch portions.

Price (1 star) - 

Alright this is where it really gets me. The food here was incredibly expensive, the toppings were anywhere from $2 to $7 dollars. We had pepperoni and sausage, and the pizza was about $19 for a 12 inch pizza. PRICEY! Our bill came out to over $25 with an appetizer and pizza, this didn't include tip and we didn't get any drinks.

Overall, the price is what we keep me away from here. I would just as easily go to Grimaldi's or even NYPD for similar quality food for half the price. They overprice EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"I hate to be like this, but this new place just isn't as good as the old.  Their pizza used to be much better; especially the crust.  I can't put my finger on it but something is just different and not in a good way.  The prices have always been on the high side for pizza but it was always worth it.  Not anymore.

I am almost never in Tempe so when I knew I would be for the day, I wanted to have this pizza.  I didn't even know they moved until I saw it here on Yelp.  I knew the shopping center where the place is now located so I knew just where to go.  However, it ticked me off that it was a pain in the ass to find because there was nothing that said \"Classic Italian Pizza\" anywhere on their exterior sign OR anywhere in the actual restaurant.  Upon finding then entering the place I almost had to ask if I was in right place.

Anyway, the service was excellent but I don't think I'll be back because the pizza wasn't go-out-of-your-way good enough."}
{"text":"Great pizza with fresh ingredients.  But no wood-oven taste as they claimed and the prices are a little on the high side for freshly made pizza.

Great service from our server, kind of made up for an overpriced appetizer of olive oil and bread."}
{"text":"We decided to visit C.I.P. because Phoenix magazine compared them to Pizzeria Bianco and gave them a better review than Bianco.... Humm...

The restaurant sits in the corner of a run down strip mall. The inside was very nice though and we were greeted promptly. They have the big wood fire over like bianco but the place isn't nearly as big. We took seats at the bar and ordered some wine. The menu was small and nothing really jumped out at me as \"unique\".... Pretty standard. I ordered the margarita with the basil (u have to ask for it) and my boyfriend had a calzone. The crust was nice on the pizza crunchy yet soft... But as for the rest of the pizza... Meh... It definitely did not have enough sauce and the cheese was not fresh (UNlike Bianco) it was pretty average tasting to me. As for the calzone we pretty much ran into the same issues... Ricotta wasn't fresh nor was the mozzarella the sauce for it came out cold... Nothing spectacular. 

This place is worth trying and does have an intimate setting for a weekday visit. Our server was very nice and I did like the  place... Would I compare it to pizzeria bianco? Absolutely not. Besides Cibo is still the best pizza I've ever had in Phx."}
{"text":"Resturants in strip malls are deceiving... that is why i searched for pizza on yelp before I just went out to another pizza place and be disappointed. This resturant was in a strip mall and I wouldn't have stopped if I was just driving past it. I found in on Yelp and decided to go for a nice quiet date night and it was perfect! I was definately go back here again to take family, friends visiting, another night out. Cute inside and outside, I was very pleased with the pizza as well. I got the proscutto pizza and it was very yummy. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"We were fans of the place at its previous location and have been to the new location several times.  It seems that the \"new\" oven has hit that sweet spot where the crust is that same perfect pillowy middle with chewy outside that it was in the old location.  We are so happy to have our old date night place back!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting their new location and first time since I've been gluten free. I loved their old location, the atmosphere inside was great and their food was delicious. Their gluten free pizza was pretty good, though don't skimp on the toppings as they can make even gluten free taste good! 

I don't love the outside patio. It is right next to a parking lot and looks like you are surrounded by a cage. Hopefully they'll spruce it up a little... maybe add vines through the \"cage\" so you don't feel like you could high five the car driving by you while you eat."}
{"text":"Classic Italian Pizza was recommended to me by some friends who said, \"You may think it's not there, but it is.\"  Oh yes, it is and is fantastic.  I crave their food!  Being a vegetarian many places don't have much to offer, but their menu offers many different options for those of us who don't eat meat anymore.  I have introduced many family and friends to this restaurant and each one of them has returned many times.  The appetizers are fantastic (Aglio Olio is my favorite) as well as any pizza I have had and any others that my friends have tried.  Give them a try, you won't regret it (I hope!)."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Classic Italian for years and was so glad to hear they reopened near Guadalupe and McClintock.  The food is good, the service is good! Where are all of the people?! Eat here!"}
{"text":"I love this place, simply just love it.
   I have now been to this amazing restaurant 7 times and the last one was with a large party. The owner and staff are great  and always accommodating.Their knowledge of the products of which they serve is superb.
   Now for the good part, the food and beer! Everything I have tried here is fantastic. The brick oven bread is a great appetizer, soft doughy bites that come with a marinara sauce that is to die for. Their prosciutto wrapped asparagus is phenomenal, granted anything with prosciutto is :p.  Last night I had the special which isn't on the menu but its up on the board in bright pink writing! This pizza is too good for words, I added a prosciutto base (shocking I know) and feta and the flavors from these just complemented this pizza. 
    Anyways enough rambling from me, about my favorite new pizza place."}
{"text":"BETTER THAN PIZZERIA BIANCO
Seriously.

Seriously, seriously, seriously good pizza.

The only thing that bothered me about this place.... the name.... I honestly can't stand the name of this place.....

However, the pizza is perfection.
I can't imagine a better pizza.

It totally reminded me of the pizzas I've had in Italy and France, much moreso than any other pizzeria in the valley.

Loved it.  Really."}
{"text":"Not what I expected at all. All the reviews say it's amazing, better than Bianco's, blah blah. Not really that good. I mean it was barely edible. I had the marg. pizza. Nope sorry! It was just a cheese pizza really and super small with some improperly cut basil over the top. The crust was pathetic. Typical all purpose flour used, no flavor, not crusty and chewy, too much extra flour on it which made it dry. Mix between Weber White bread and a bagel. Very compact crust. Heavy!!!! YUK! The Cheese on the pizza was not bad. I feel he did not cook it long enough for my taste. Looked like a pizza from wherever. I also had a salad and the lettuce was cut so big it was ridiculous. I won't be going back. Plus their beer selection sucks. I guess Polish beer for the Polish owner. Seriously though, Polish beer in an Italian Pizza joint? What the cuss? $31 for a pizza that tasted like a step down from Trader joes Frozen pizza (actually that is better), salad that I could have made at home for .43 cents and polish beer. Go fuck yourself Classic!!!"}
{"text":"At first glance this place seems appealing. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. And that's about the nicest thing I can say about \"classic Italian pizza\". Our server seemed more interested in the girl sitting at the bar than attending to us and the other patrons in the restaurant. Our pizza took about 25 mins to come to  our table, which would be fine if it was worth the wait. But it wasn't.  We were served pizza that was no where near worth the $16 it costed. They served us a dry no sauce, wilted toppings, 12 inch  mediocre pizza. We asked for more sauce to try and give flavor to it. It didn't help, and certainly not worth the extra $4. I honestly would have been happier with a $5 little Cesar's pizza. At least I'd know I wouldn't be over paying for crappy service and even worse pizza. We had to ask for water twice and I even had to go up to the bar to pay after waiting for another 15 mins for our server to come back.  Really disappointed in this place. The cost is NOT worth the product served.  What a shame. Don't put this food in your mouth."}
{"text":"The neopolitan pizza game in Phoenix metro has been heating up. Bianco set the bar and many have heeded the challenge. Classic Italian pizza is a long time Tempe option that has not kept pace.

Despite their new location the pizza and salads fall short. The Baby Blue salad was soaked in dressing, with some wilted pieces of lettuce and only a few chunks of bleu cheese.

The Garlic and Basil pizza was nothing more than a flat-bread light on the cheese and the cust was a bit under done, I really think their over should be warmer. for $11 it was far from worth it.

As for a side of sauce, they will also hit you up for $3.50

The other pizza was unexceptional for $16.  

Next time I want high end pizza, I will brave the wait and drive to CIBO or Pomo."}
{"text":"Went here a year ago trying to finder best pizza. It was very good we got there bread sampler with meats and cheese it was great. Pizza was thin which I liked."}
{"text":"Classic Italian Pizza is the best brick oven pizza in town! Never disappointed and the staff ROCKS! Four cheese with sausage is money! They also have fantastic wines!"}
{"text":"We've been to their old location, but the new one is so much cuter and located in a shopping center very close to our grocery store, Trader Joe's! Super convenient for us! We can grab dinner and then go shopping on a Saturday night when they're not so busy!

We discovered our favorite pizza, the Four Seasons. All of their pizzas are 12\" and thin crusts. This one has prosciutto, mushrooms, artichoke and olives, separated in four sections; however , order it \"mixed\"; it's so good that way! We ordered an arugula salad to start which was big enough for two. I ordered a glass of their Chardonnay and hubby ordered their porter beer; both of which were very yummy!  

The place isn't large and not too small; low and high top seating as well as bar seating. A great place for date nights or group dining!

We highly recommend!

Von and Greg D."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood pizza gold mine. Delicious food (loved the bread). I was also surprised at what a strong European vibe it had. I think that's mainly because they took the small, subpar space/location they had and made it work. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the staff is attentive. I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"We ordered the $10  8\" Italian sausage pizza, $8.00 Aglio Olio (Bread) with a small side of their tomato sauce.  This was my first visit  since they re-opened.  The pizza was not as good, the bread was just OK, but the tomato sauce was not even half as good as it used to be in their old location.  The \"Extra Sauce \" we ordered was ~2oz  and they charged $3.50.  The iced tea was only refilled once and they service was slow despite there only being a few people in the restaurant.  $11.50 for bread and ~3.5 ounces of sauce.  I was going to order a salad, but they only had 8, 9 or 10 dollar salads.  The rent must be very high in this strip mall for them to charge so much for so little.    Overall I was very disappointing.  I was a customer for ~1 year prior to the old shop closing and it was much better."}
{"text":"Very nice food! Had some entertainment when a woman started kicking off as she didn't know how big a 12\" pizza was! Wanted to feed 8 people with it lol. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"I continue to be amazed by this place. You can read my other reviews and Jesse J.'s for an in depth breakdown but i needed to add an update. The reason i needed to update was that I have now been 5 times in the last week and a half and its always as good and the service is amazing.

I am a huge fan of places that make you feel like they appreciate your business well here they go above and beyond. I am now known by name to the staff and made to feel like its my home away from home. My friends and I keep coming back to try new pizzas and are never let down. The owner is a great guy who goes above and beyond and can be seen talking to everyone. For my friends and I he keeps giving us new shots to try and talk beer and liquor with us. 

The way they make you feel like your at your local bar or a family dinner is great and is the icing on the cake to amazing food. If you haven't tried this place you are doing yourself a major disservice."}
{"text":"This place is great. Try a pizza with lamb as a topping - you won't regret it. Also the hatch chili and sausage pizza is phenomenal. Unfortunately I'm a bit pork intolerant, or I'd probably come back every week for this one.

I also greatly enjoy their tiramisu. Try it with a glass of Lambrusco. Not typically considered a dessert wine but they complement each other so perfectly.

Generally it's a good experience with their bartenders, too. Makes this a relaxing place to just hang out for a while and get something to eat & drink."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and I'm very disappointed with the new ownership. The dough is sad and floppy and thicker than it used to be, the pizzas are drowning in cheese, and the new sauce for the bread app tastes like they added a bottle of liquid smoke. We could not handle more than a taste (which wouldn't leave your tastebuds for awhile unfortunately). Yuck. 
Our table only came with one plate and we had to ask for more. 
Our appetiser came out just a couple of minutes before our pizza, so our table was very crowded and we had to let our pizza sit while finishing the app. 
The old fashioned cocktail is a new recipe and is not what you would be expecting if you're used to ordering and receiving the classic recipe. 
The menu now looks like someone used every single font from Microsoft Word, very cluttered, hard to look at, and a little juvenile. 
The decorations seem out of place for what is already in the space. Used to be a classy, brick-and-wine kind of feel, and now there are new age things strewn across the restaurant. Which would be fine if it actually matched the interior, but it doesn't and looks sloppy. 
Our waitress was new but you could tell she was trying to work with what she could. Felt a little bad for her. 
No one came to check on us either, to ask our opinion or how we were doing with the new recipes or the wait staff, which you would expect of new ownership. 

Goodbye, Classic Italian. :("}
{"text":"What a great hidden gem! 
My boyfriend and I came here last night for the first time after reading so wonderful yelp reviews and now I can see why! 

This place is beautiful, quaint, comfy, and friendly. We ordered an appetizer of positutto asparagus. Yum! It was cooked to perfection. The asparagus was soft and flavorful and it was wrapped inside the positutto and serves on top of olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. 

We also ordered the spicy Italian pizza and it was melt in your mouth delicious. The flavors were fresh and everything tasted as if it had been prepared that day, no frozen produce or meat here. 

We sat at the bar and watched out pizza while it cooked in the brick fire oven. 

This place is definitely with checking out. I like this place better and pizzeria Bianco!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite place for pizza.  The bartenders are very friendly and make it a point to know your name ."}
{"text":"Tonight I felt discriminated by the owner of this place: Azhar Began owner of Classic Italian Pizza, Tempe Arizona. 

He did not want to serve us because we were a large party of 11 including some kids. When I arrived the server told me that it will be 1 hour of wait and I did agree, 45 min later, Ahzar came out and told me, sorry I cannot seat you tonight, you have to make a reservation and He was not able to put tables together for 11. 

During this conversation there were 3 empty tables and I told him that we will split, and each family will seat in its own table.. He told me no Sorry I cannot do that....first He told me that if we do that, it would take 2 hours to serve us, then he said and they are reserved. He non verbal cues already was telling me.. \"I refuse to serve your party\"...

I disagree and left the premise but I told the other 2 families to go to the restaurant and ask to be seated and do not ID themselves as part of the party. They did not have a reservation and as soon as they got it, they were seated on those empty tables that Ahzar told me that they were reserved, they got their food with no issues. 

Dear Azhar you just old me a bunch of BS..its clear that you definitely refused to serve us, but so you know, you did serve half of my party and there was no resevation. Their food did not took 2 hours to be served... The message its simple, you just made an act of discrimination.... I proved you wrong with your excuses... Happy Life Azhar Began !! Happy Life! -- with @azhar Began"}
{"text":"After hearing the rave reviews from neighbors, I finally tried their pizza.  For takeout, because I have two toddlers who won't sit still, I ordered their Diavolo pizza, a 12\" thin crust with sausage, pepperoni, crushed red peppers and jalapeños.  I thought it was ok, but nothing super special.  My husband agreed.  But I will give thumbs up for the restaurant's intimate yet boisterous atmosphere set in a secluded yet nearly empty strip mall.  It had a bar with a large flat screen tv and it was packed the Saturday 8pm night I was there,  I'd go there for data night for another entree, but I would likely take out pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with the food, luckily we were with great friends so we had a fun time."}
{"text":"Just an other pizza place. Good ambience and service. Best of all pizzas are made in a fire oven.

Ordered 
Herbivore Pizza- decent 12' pizza, lacking a wow factor in taste I feel. 
Oven baked bread - a square flat bread with marinara on the side. Sauce was really yummy.

I would rate 3.5."}
{"text":"I feel bad for anyone who hasn't discovered this place yet.  My new favorite pizza place in Arizona... I've been searching for years.

Nestled in the deep corner of a dimly light strip mall and beneath a huge old clock, Classic Italian Pizza is full of patrons who are raving about the delicious wood fire cooked pizza, salads and the best tiramisu this side of the Mississippi.  We're overjoyed that we've discovered this place.

This is an expensive classy pizza joint, serving Italian-style thin crust pizzas with all the freshest and highest quality toppings.  The pizzas come in one size, 12\".  Your meal comes with fresh wood fired italian bread.  I highly recommend dipping the bread into their house dressing, absolutely amazing!  Speaking of which, the fresh salad and their house dressing were among the best we'd ever had.

It's hard to find a good Sangria and since everything was tasting so good, we decided to give it a shot.  Strong, but perfectly tasty.  This is a very good drink.

We ordered the Italian Sausage, which comes with chopped mushrooms, green peppers and onions.  Naturally, I had to add pepperoni to this pie.  OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD EXCELLENT!  Wow, I'm coming back many many times and screaming from rooftops about how good this pizza is.  I'm from Chicago and hate just about everything in Arizona, so you can see my excitement in finding this place.

We've also since come back and tried the four seasons pizza, which is basically split into four different sections; each with proscuitto, parmesan, and tomato sauce: tomato, olive, artichokes, mushrooms.  The tomato was so damn good we will definitely be ordering this again.

The service is great, obviously a family run operation.  The same three people were working there each time I've come.  The talk to each other in Italian sometimes and are very passionate about what they do.

You will never find this place if you don't look for it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat have eaten here at least 4 times and typically show up on Friday's around 5pm.  The food is consistently good and they have a great drink menu.  Appetizers are good too.  This is an easy place to like.  We enjoy strolling over to the bookstore after dinner.  I must say the staff is ALWAYS terrific.  We like chatting with them and have received excellent service."}
{"text":"First a couple of disclaimers, once again I'm not an expert - I know what I like and don't like, and I haven't studied in Italy like an Olive Garden chef (hehehe).  And I haven't been to the all-hailed PB's because I'd probably rip every hair individually out of my arms waiting for 2-3 hours....I just would.

I was introduced to the place on a 1st date and I was definitely paying more attention to my date, but I remember really enjoying the vegetarian pizza and the atmosphere.  And getting lucky later, also 4 out of 5 stars.  Not being nearby I didn't make it back soon enough, although i wanted to.  So I was happy to snag the Groupon for a special night with friends.

With early reservations we got there just before it started filling up and started with the antipasto, some tasty cheeses and meats - really liked the red pepper puree.  We all enjoyed some wine and ordered the spinach and a special, essentially ham with diced red pepper.  The pizza's arrived in a timely manner, looked and smelled great and everyone agreed - that's good pizza.  

No triple meat triple cheese cheese stuffed crust dipping sauce greasy gooey basterdized American junk.  CI is none of that - it has a tasty, thin, crisp crust, quality ingredients, nice cheeses, not too much of anything, just enough of everything.  Yes its a little on the pricy side, but I'll pay $16 for a delectable pie over $8 for a heap o'crap one any day of the week.  

The service was good and we noticed a few tables of repeaters there, I believe the chef/owner strolling around chatting with them.  I like that too."}
{"text":"So this review is only three stars but don't take this review as a poor rating.  CIP is a great place to come eat somewhat authentic neapolitan pizzas. Let me preface my review by saying that I have been spoiled by and incredible find in Paris, France, a place called Pizza Positano which I use as my measuring bar for all neapolitan pizzas and authentic fresh pasta.

Back to my review, CIP makes an admirable rendition of a neapolitan pizza. I have been here twice and enjoyed my first visit more than my last. The second time my pizza was a little undercooked and the crust a little thick, but by comparison to other Phoenix options it is still far better choice. The prosciutto wrapped asparagus the first time was really good but this time it was terribly dry and overly salty. Finally, while the service was very friendly it was terribly slow.

The location is unique. It is incredibly well hidden! That is good in that you have to know about it to find it which makes it special and only a local crowd favorite. But that hurts it in terms of exposure and awareness which I think the restaurant could also benefit from. The atmosphere is nice with the open kitchen and wood fired oven. The decor is appropriate and comfortable and I really appreciate the fact that the restaurant is owner run! That is always a plus.

One negative was this last visit where I came for my birthday dinner with my family and father and brother who were visiting from out of town. There was a table inside large enough but the hostess didn't want to give us that table so we agreed to sit outside. When we asked for a heater to be turned on were were met with a bit of a grumpy attitude from the hostess and she stated that it was not that cold. Frankly, what the hostess thinks is not important and if I have family members that are a little chilly then just turn on the heaters thank you. Make the dining experience enjoyable for the customer. That is all. :-)"}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite for happy hour and dinner.  I tried the caprese (served on a really cool plate), and took a pizza to-go and it was incredible!  Plus, who can beat $5 glasses of wine and grapefruit beer from Germany.  The chalk board shows where the cheese and meats are from, which is also great.  Will bring my friends and family here for sure as it is all kinds of delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty good wood fired pizza, but it is extremely expensive. Not worth the extra cost. The service is not bad but the place is nothing special to warrant charging a lot more than even Pizzeria Bianco."}
{"text":"Classic Italian Pizza is hands down some of the best pizza I've had, anywhere, thus far. In the Phoenix area, even better overall food-wise than Cibo, and could possibly (but not entirely) even rival the holy Pizzeria Bianco in similar quality and consistency.

Unlike those other said restaurants, however, the atmosphere at CIP is always casual, relaxed and unfussy. Very family-friendly.

Highly fresh ingredients are used, including their notable homemade mozzarella and pizza dough. The pies, all baked made-to-order in a large stone pizza oven, come out perfect. The crust consistently has just the right amount of crispiness, while still remaining perfectly air-soft and tender. Add in that said homemade mozzarella, as well as sauces, and you have the making of pizza heaven.

The very hidden, nondescript space, tucked away in the far corner of a strip mall, is homey and comfortable. The mom-and-pop vibe is ever-present, and the no-nonsense and straight-forward friendliness of the owners (and service) is always a welcome change of pace. Whether you live in the vicinity, or a moderate drive away, CIP is easily worth the trip for some excellent Pizza."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today for a work lunch. I must admit; I wasn't expecting much. Living downtown, I'm accustomed to the likes of Pomo and Cibo. I must say, however, I was pleasantly surprised! Everyone ordered a pizza - perfectly crispy crusts and fresh toppings all around! I also had a side salad (the bleu) which I will say, for a side, was a generous portion and quite delicious!

I was also impressed by their affordable wine selections (which unfortunately I didn't get to try this go around). They do boast a decent happy hour so perhaps a second visit is in my near future!"}
{"text":"I have lived in this area of Tempe for a very long time. Classic Italian Pizza has been around for many years with a new location at Guadalupe and McClintock. When it first opened at Rural and Baseline, the pizza was crispy, well seasoned and delish. Maybe a new owner took over or they changed the recipe, but it changed to a less yummy, blander version of pizza. The restaurant does have its followers and the restaurant stayed open long past the rest of the businesses in the shopping center. They have finally found a new home. The interior of the new place is well done with a good selection of wines and craft beers. We tried the pizza again and found that despite the move, the pizza is the same. Somehow, the crust tastes kind of bland-- lacking a yeasty, bread-y flavor. Maybe more like a lahvosh or flatbread. Some salt or olive oil in the dough might help. Sauces are painted on and the cheese is minimal. Toppings are well done and tasty.
I have been to Italy and this is not really classic Italian pizza. Crusts in Italy are thin but have a great flavor that this crust lacks. A 12\" pizza of little heft will set you back $11-$15. If you like their pizza in the past, you will not be disappointed. But I just can't get past the boring crust. 
An OK experience, if a bit pricey."}
{"text":"We were surprised to find a busy restaurant tucked in this huge, desolate shopping center. We were greeted quickly with a smiling face of our server, who was attentive and just the right amount chatty. Homey ambiance.

We ordered drinks at the bar while we waited for our to-go order. During that time, we saw a man who appeared to be the manager, be RUDE to his staff. We found him extremely distasteful and I'm not sure his face knows how to smile. He began to give the server who was busy with a full restaurant, a hard time about people at the bar not being helped. They looked happy to us! 

Finally, the food. The food was really good. I would say it is a little pricey for the size and amount, but worth it. My daughter who is really picky ate 4 pieces. We ordered the Prosciutto Pizza, good but salty as Prosciutto is a salty meat. The cheese pizza was perfect!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I dream about their prosciutto wrapped asparagus. They added a gluten free pizza crust and it is delicious! It reminds me of a buttery saltine cracker, it's even a little chewy which should say a lot to my fellow gluten free crust pizza eaters (GF crust can be reminiscent of cardboard). Sangria is tasty too! Well appointed decor and great staff make it one of my favorite go-to places."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this pizza is not worth $15....plain and simple. Go spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very nice wood fired pizza. Quick and friendly service. Whilst waiting a unsatisfied and rude customer was kicking off about her (pick up) pizza being too small. The menu clearly states 12inches which is a normal size for a pizza but it was efficiently dealt with by giving her money back. 
I personally am glad to have found this place and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Oh well. 

Asparagus and prosciutto appetizer was fantastic and set high expectations. 

They give you a basket of bread knots but without any oil and vinegar, it lacked punch. We tried to use what little oil was left from the asparagus. 

We did notice that they sell an appetizer that sounds like a great oil dip - but for 8 bucks or so, not worth it. 

Pizza dough was tasteless even with the sausage mushroom, onion and pepper mix. I couldn't help but compare it to a Pizza Hut Supreme - that I hadn't tasted in 20 years. 

Friendly service at the counter and the app shouldn't have to carry the main course here - especially when it a pizza joint. 

After 3 glasses of wine, a pizza, soup and app, it was an $80 tab for 2. 

Sorry, that's a bit much for a pizza night out."}
{"text":"High quality, flavorful food.  Creative ingredients. Great pizzas, salads and sandwiches. Staff has always been very friendly, attentive and fast.  Small dining area but weekday lunch has not been crowded when I've been there."}
{"text":"To continue, if I wrote a review every time I came, I'd never have time for anything else. I LOVE this place, the pizza, the staff, the owner. 

Must haves: sauce & bread
Began for more (house cocktail)
Olives & cheese (appetizer)
PIZZA!!! Your choice!"}
{"text":"The new ownership is really taking a great place and making it so much better! Their attention to detail with wonderful ingredients and friendly environment makes this a true gem! We are happy to drive from Phoenix to this delicious spot! I have yet to try a wine or pizza I don't like here and we feel that is rare. I consider myself to be a total foodie and wine-o and this checks all the boxes for me! We'll be back. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I teetered between 1 and 2 stars...

I'm not sure what turned me off more: the guy (the cook, the owner? one in the same) who greeted me at the door in a white tee-shirt and sprouting chest hair (ala Simon Cowell, but decidedly NOT the pec-proud Idol Judge), the wobbly chair I was worried might break at any second, or the fact that it took more than 10 minutes to receive our drinks!

Not a good start, to say the least.

The pizza my friend ordered (the \"Greek\") was cold and \"uninspired\" and my calzone's crust was equally cold and bland--absolutely NO FLAVOR to the crust that supposedly cooks in a wood-fired oven, No burn marks, no crispness, nothing even approaching my favorite calzone from Cibo or Bianco in Downtown Phoenix.

Unfortunately, the prices were as high as those other establishments, which seals the coffin on this place for me. Put it in the ground and bury it!"}
{"text":"Family friendly place, amazing pizza and great service.Been there in many occasions and service was top notch every single time. Pizza and other appetizers were fresh and worth 5 Stars. Attended Family party there and were very pleased how they handled our reservation and accommodated our family from small children to the the oldest. Definitely recommended, and don't forget to order from their cocktail menu...you will not regret. 5+"}
{"text":"To put it succinctly, Classic Italian Pizza is like a hybrid of New York style pizza and the pizza napoletana style of Cibo and Bianco. It is quite good--better than most other local pizzerias I've tasted.

If you are someone who has always eaten pan / NY / Chicago style pizzas and want something more authentic, this is a good place to start. BUT, if you do like this place, then I suggest you try the all-the-way-authentic pizzas at places like Cibo or Bianco."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood pizza place. The wood fired pizza is delicious. The have good beer and wine too. The only way to get better pizza is too stand in line at Biancos."}
{"text":"Yelp Mobile App...you have steered me toward better dining opportunities.

On searching out the location, we were not impressed with the location...located in the corner of a nearly dead strip mall...we thought this was the hidden gem in the Tempe italian world.  We were somewhat embarassed after we ordered, especially with friends from Milan in our party.

On pulling up to the restaurant, we walked in and waited at the 'seating stand'.  The waitress came after about 5 minutes (she was working to deliver orders to the folks at tables), asking how many were dining and where we would like to sit.  We let her know we were ordering to go, and she motioned us to the bar.

On arriving at the bar and not sitting, we were asked if we were ordering to go or to eat in.  We let the person requesting our order know that we would be ordering to go.  She brought up her pen and order pad and asked what we would order.  We ordered a mushroom/pepperoni/sausage pie sufficient for 4.  Waitress asked if we would wait for our order, and when we said we would go to Big Lots in the same mall, she said we would wait 35-40 minutes for our order.  

We walked out and down to Big Lots, finding a few items we could not pass up.  Leaving Big Lots at 30 minutes after we placed our order, we proceeded to put our purchases in the vehicle and headed back to the restaurant to pick up dinner.  When we arrived, the waitress advised we were early, and would we like a beer or glass of wine while we waited.  We declined and stood waiting for the pizza we ordered.

What was delivered 10 minutes later was a 12-inch pie.  While we anticipated a pizza that was sufficiently loaded to take care of 4 people dining, we were sadly disappointed.  We took the pizza we ordered and drove a mile to the homestead.  When we arrived and opened the box, we were all underwhelmed at the toppings.  There were 2 strips of sausage, 5 pepperoni slices and 5 mushroom slices.  

While I was reminded that we should have opened the box at the restaurant, I replied that we should give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt.  Was I mistaken?  ABSOLUTELY!  Being hungry, I resisted the normal 'check it out before leaving' concept. 

$19.25 for a 12\" pizza with such minimal toppings, I was directed to return to the restaurant with the insufficient pizza.  On arriving back at the restaurant, I was told that since I left before lodging my dissatisfaction, nothing would be done about the order I placed, as I might have \"peeled toppings off to express my dissatisfaction\". 

If you want to spend too much money for a pizza, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area since 1999.  A friend told me about the place after she fell in love with a wine on their menu.   My husband and I lived in the Tempe area and decided to try it.  I'll never forget that first visit.   The pizza was amazing.  My preference is thin, crispy pizza, and the woodfired, european style found at Classic Italian is fantastic.   I've been to Pizzeria Bianco several times and it is the bomb.  Classic Italian is a great place to frequent on the East side when the long waits are hard to endure at Chris Bianco's establishment downtown.   Ahzar has treated us to his port and company on several occasions and it is always a delight."}
{"text":"Some of the absolute WORST pizza I've ever had. I hate writing negative reviews, but this place was a true disappointment. My friends and I were at Changing Hands amd hadn't really eaten all day so decided to try this pizza. The pizza was flavorless, zero sauce, it looked unappealing and unappetizing. We expressed our concerns to our waiter, and he seemed to not really care. We ended up having to take our payment up to the bar ourselves. I love and adore pizza, and this place makes pizza look like trash. Want real pizza? Go to Spinato's."}
{"text":"We were really disappointed with the experience here. For the over priced pizza, I was expecting quality ingredients and service. There was one other table in the restaurant, yet somehow, our server was only able to stop by our table twice. 
The food was soggy, the beer was room temp, and they were out of Parmesan! How is a pizza place out of Parmesan?? It's not even real Parmesan, comparable to what's served at Pizza Hut.. which would have been cheaper and maybe taste about the same. 
Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Holy majolies! Classic Italian Pizza is fantastico! I love it when, after living here most of my life, I discover a new-to-me gem that is tucked away in a strip mall. This one, particularly, is my favorite find yet this year!

I love a crispy thin crust brick-oven baked pizza. I am on the lookout for fresh products and the Sicilian style and I find this positively authentic! I showed this place my \"O\" face (as in oh my goodness)!! My friend and I walked in later on a Thursday night and found only a few tables occupied, so we stole a table on the patio (where they have heaters available) and ordered Tuscan vino de Montepulciano. I am impressed with the selections they have. 

We were told that there is no extra charge to do half and half pizza selections, so we chose wisely: One all white pizza split with the Basil and Garlic on one side and the Four Cheeses on the other. Next, we chose half Diavola (with fresh Italian sausage and red peppers) and the other half Prosciutto with basil trimmings. I fully expected to be blown away by the Prosciutto and Diavola, which were fresh, and delicious and everything I hoped for-- HOWEVER, stop the presses! The four cheeses snuck up and stole the show! I can't even believe how tasty this pizza was. When my friend suggested it, I think I even made a disappointed face. No, this pizza is one of the most flavorful, savory and tasty pizzas I have sincerely ever had and my friend and I fought over the crumbs. 

In relation to The Parlor and Pizzeria Bianco, I think those places are quality with fantastic locations and trendy atmospheres, which adds to their wait times and buzz. This place deserves no less ranting and raving, despite its traditional pizza joint atmosphere and strip mall location. It is worth it!"}
{"text":"Barber shop, dentist, big lots, tanning salon (by the way, why the eff are there so many tanning salons here in AZ?  it's sunny 330 days a year!  go stand outside! but i digress), clocktower that appears to be broken and perpetually set at 7:16 and... pizza place.    Welcome to strip mall suburban heaven.  

I decided to do take out at this place at the suggestion of yelp (thanks yelp!).  I picked \"pizza\", scrolled to roughly my area and hit search.  viola! this place popped up as the best reviewed.  I don't think this place does a ton of takeaway, because when I walked in there's no clear place to pick up your order, so I walked through the tables of couples eating their meals & drinking wine, finally coming to the bar, \"uh... here to pick up a pizza?\"  They were super quick (phone in to ready for pick up in 20 minutes) and the service was friendly.  I dig the interior.  The guy makes your dough pretty much right in front of you and the brick oven is the centerpiece of the behind the bar area.

Now, the pizza itself was pretty decent.  They only come in one size (12''), which is perfect for two.  If you have more than two, uhh... order two pizzas? It's a chewy thin crust, and a little floppy for my taste, but it's tasty.  Looking for something other than pizza?  Hope you like salads.  No pasta, chicken, sushi, tapas or beef wellington here.  

I've been debating between 3 & 4 stars.  i think if they had a little more variety, I'd round up.  I'll probably try this place out again, maybe as a sit down next time.  It seemed like a nice, cozy, conversation-conducive place."}
{"text":"I just don't love this like so many others. I live nearby as well and never even noticed it until reading about it on Yelp. I find it overpriced and do not like their pizza crust when compared to similar places. Decor is tacky. Service is extremely attentive and nice, but overall the food does not impress. CIP is \"a-ok\" but there are too many other options around for me to consider this place again."}
{"text":"Here is where my best food friend (bff...to me) and I disagree:  Classic Italian Pizza.  

I think it is alright.  It definitely is a place that supports my \"treasure hunt\" hypothesis to finding great stuff in the Phx (for crying out loud, it is next to a Big Lots!).  

I've been here three times, at least (1:  with bff, 2:  with a date who said he gave a former student/girfriend an \"A for the lay\" - yeah, that was the 1st and only date - .  3:  with Mom and Step Dad).  I don't know -- I appreciate the wood fired oven, the totally sweet staff, and the bread, but the food just doesn't quite cut the mustard for me.  I suppose all those years in Rome (okay, those TWO years in Rome) really amped up my snob factor. 

I would take a picky date here in the future -- because it has good date atmosphere, I couldn't date anyone who couldn't support the TH hypothesis, and who doesn't at least LIKE pizza?"}
{"text":"I had been reading about the best places to get pizza around town and this spot was on my list. Entered the restaurant at dinner time it was pretty empty... The staff really friendly and helpful I ordered a beer off a list of beer I have never had before I went with a Karlovacko it's the house lager I really enjoyed it had to order another. When it came time to order started with the Asparagus & Prosciutto (Asparagus wrapped in prosciutto and baked in our brick oven). A+ really good Italian Sausage (Homemade pork sausage, wood roasted mushrooms, onions, green peppers, fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce). A++ You know something is good when each bit you say out loud wow this is good pizza. I will be back to this spot for sure lots I want to order still."}
{"text":"The pizza and service is off the charts. The food is such a high quality and the chef seems to put his passion into his menu as well as his wine selection. Try the French onion soup and the Gluten free pizza."}
{"text":"Overall, the pizza was excellent compared to 99% of other pizza places.  However, the exception would be Pizzeria Bianco.  Unfortunately for myself and my GF, we went to Pizzeria Bianco first when we moved to Phoenix, and ever since cant help but compare every other pizza place to Bianco's.  This is a pickle.  CIP was downgraded one star because the prices are just too high for the taste, at least with Bianco's not far away.  A plus however, is the quick seating (again when compared to Bianco's!)  We were seated as soon as we arrived, although on the patio, and reservations are recommended.  But if you are unaware, Bianco's can take up to 4 hrs to get a table at!  So, if you want the second best pizza (so far) we have tried in the PHX area, try CIP, especially if you don't want to wait too long.  But Bianco's Rosa is still the best!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza in Arizona.  The atmosphere was great, my wine was yummy, service was great, and the pizza was fresh and tasty.  We can't wait to bring our family here when they visit- plus it's walking distance from home, so we can drink all the wine we want!  Bravo to Classic Italian Pizza!"}
{"text":"Love this joint! A simple margherita pizza is my test for good pizza places. Often, it's the \"simplest\" dishes that are the most difficult to execute. Classic Italian won't disappoint! This is my East-Valley pick for best pizza. 

Although they have a full bar, they don't stock Campari. Just a personal taste I have, I suppose. There's not much to brag about the scene. With zero street visibility, no proximity to night life/culture and hidden in an half-empty strip mall, the restaurant must rely on its great  food to sustain business. (not a bad business model... others should take note!)

Hit Classic Italian purely for the food and it's an easy winner! Staff is friendly and the pizza is about as good as it gets in the Valley."}
{"text":"great pizzas and salads. We have our favorite 4 seasons pizza!
wish they had more chardonnay wines."}
{"text":"Good food but wont go back as I don't like the beer they have.  They need Coors Light, or Bud Light etc."}
{"text":"Tucked within the defunct shopping center that used to house Big Lots and Pure Fitness, Classic Italian Pizza is one of the last bastions of shopping civilization this center will ever hold.  According to the staff, this center will be demolished, so they are moving at the end of the summer to the QT/New Big Lots area close by.

When we entered we were greeted warmly by one of the waitresses and were promptly seated.  We ordered the garlic dipping oil to start with ($7.95), which came with small freshly baked bread pieces, a generous amount of pumpkin seed oil with freshly chopped garlic and jalapeno.  Although the pumpkin seed oil had a nice, nutty flavor, and the garlic and jalapeno were fresh, it tasted bland as a whole.  What I would recommend is to add salt, pepper, and Parmesan from the shakers to the dip and it will taste 10 times better!

We ordered the Four Seasons, which came out in a unique presentation.  The whole pizza is covered with prosciutto, but then each 1/4 of the pizza has a different vegetable covering it, to represent each season (Artichoke, olive, tomato, and mushroom).  You can also order all the ingredients mixed in equally on the pizza if you wish, but we decided to go with what the restaurant recommended, and we were glad we did!  It was nice to have a different ingredient on each slice I ate.  It made me feel like I was eating 4 different pizzas.  The crust was initially crisp, but the center does get bogged down and a little soggy as the more watery ingredients start to infuse into the crust, but it doesn't detract from the taste too much.  Although it was a bit pricey ($17.95), the ingredients were high quality and there was a healthy amount of ingredient on each part of the pizza.  

I also ordered the red sangria, which was smooth, and fruity from the addition of orange juice to the wine and brandy.  Minus some points for using generic canned fruit cocktail instead of fresh fruit in the sangria glass, especially if I'm paying $8.95 for it!

Service was very friendly.  If I'm in the mood for more artisan type pizza, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Same great pizza, different location!

Business seems to be picking up at the new location, with its proximity to Trader Joe's and Turnstyle. 

We've been here a few times, both for dinner and for late night reverse happy hour (Discounted drinks, pizza, and appetizers). The pizza has been consistently good, with a light, thin crisp crust, just the right amount of toppings. The pizza combinations we've tried have been excellent. 

Service is also consistent, with cheerful, attentive friendly servers."}
{"text":"I read some reviews for the best pizza in AZ, and stumbled across this place, which is the closest to home.  My friend and I decided to man-date it here one night.  Got there right at the dinner rush to see this place severely under staffed.  I guess a bunch of the wait staff had called in.  We were seated promptly despite this and ordered up some of the venerated bread appetizer.  The bread was really good, i don't know if it warranted all the praise it gets but... its some pretty good bread.  I ordered the prosciutto pie and my friend ordered an eggplant parm pie (no idea how we are still friends).  They do have an interesting beer list, mostly international brews, but very good.  The prosciutto pizza was amazing; light, thin crispy.  Even the Eggplant Parmesan pizza was really good (Side Note: Eggplant Parm pizza was not good as a leftover. The eggplant turned into rubbery tires, not a problem from the restaurant, just a tip.)  

Overall: great pizza, pretty good appetizers, good service.  But its pretty pricey."}
{"text":"I had heard this establishment was coming to the Trader Joe's and Changing Hand's shopping center so I was excited to see it had opened when I went to do my monthly TJ shopping this weekend and decided to give it a try.

First, great decor and friendly staff. I sat right at the bar and was glad to see a number of local beers on tap. I ordered a Hopshock IPA and it was served on a wonderfully frosty beer glass, perfect for the summer! In addition, I went for the classic, the Margherita piiza ($9) and added the Proscuitto for $3 more.

I like that you can see them backing the pizza from the dining area and it is a wood fired oven. Interesting that they add the basil fresh chopped on top versus baking it with the cheese and sauce and it did add a nice fresh, herb taste to the overall pizza.

I've never been to the old location and have nothing to compare it to and for me, this establishment is a nice addition  to the overall area. I can certainly see myself going back again for lunch on a weekend and for me, extremely convenient location as it is near so many other great places in this shopping center."}
{"text":"Now you have another excuse to go Changing Hands and Traders Joe's in South Tempe.  Classic Italian Pizza has opened in a new and improved location after being closed for about a year. Same owner and same great thin crust wood fired pizza with really fresh authentic ingredients such as the Diavolo with fresh garlic.  For the moment, they are only open for dinner.  Pizzeria Bianco remains my favorite but Classic Italian is in my neighborhood.  Be warned, the owner has a strong following so they could be very busy as the word gets out.
If you are shut out or can't wait, Miele's Italian is across the street in next to Fry's and they have a tasty white pizza."}
{"text":"I would love to be able to review the pizza here, unfortunately, I can't because we never had a chance to try it. We walked into the restaurant at 6:30 (I know because I looked at my watch wondering if we were late meeting friends). We had tickets to the Improv and had to leave by 8:15 for a 9:00 show. We ordered 2 salads and 2 pizzas at 6:45. Salads were delivered around 7:15. They were ok, but at $10.75/salad we expected more and the server told us they were large enough for two. In reality, it was a one person salad and nothing special. At 7:45 they brought plates for pizza so we anticipated it would be there any time. 8 women, at the table next to us, were already there when we sat down, and they still didn't have their food either. Finally, at 8:05 my husband went to the counter and asked about our pizza. Our less than friendly waitress told him that there were 'at least 4 pizzas' in front of us. When he looked at the brick oven, he noticed there were no pizzas in it. My husband told our waitress to close out our check so we could leave. Without even getting a pizza our tab was over 50 bucks for 2 salads, 3 beers and a glass of wine. We were looking for another pizza place because of the poor service at Pizza Bianco. So, while they both had horrible service, at least we ate at Bianco's, not so much at Classic Italian Pizza, and it didn't appear that the restaurant cared one bit. There are a few places we like in town, VinciTorio's in Tempe and Bell' Italia Pizzeria in Ahwatukee, good food, good service. If you haven't tried them I would recommend going there instead of Classic Italian Pizza or Pizza Bianco."}
{"text":"We have been going to classic since it opened. Always great friendly service and always tasty food. Good beer and wine selections. Bread app with tomato sauce is relish. Fave pizzas are four cheese, four seasons and the salami/olive. Four seasons can get a bit soggy due to tomato but otherwise tasty. Four cheese is our fave. Save room for tiramisu...the best around.

Shopping center being torn down so classic is moving. Not sure where yet but they promise nearby and they'll keep all of us fans posted via Facebook."}
{"text":"Arizona has some really great options for pizza. I've been going to classic Italian for many years, going back to when they at their previous location. This is my favorite pizza place in Tempe. The location is great and think it is awesome that they have a bar now Their menu is simple but has just enough options for everyone. My favorite is the margarita with mushrooms and pepperoni. The ingredients always taste fresh and the brick oven \"char\" create that perfect pizza taste. Tiramisu is an absolute must as well!"}
{"text":"Very cute little neighborhood pizzaria.  Pizza is a bit pricey, but very tasty.  Definately on par with Pizzaria Bianco in terms of good woodfire pizza.  Then again I wasn't super impressed with them."}
{"text":"I've been to Classic Italian's old location and this is the first time I've been to their new location. Hidden in the middle of a shopping center, we walk-in and it's not large but good sized. They have a few lower tables, high-top tables, bar seating, and outdoor seating in a little gated area. One thing I did notice is they don't have a hostess stand. All they have is a wall ledge as you walk in that has their waiting list. Waiters and waitresses seat you. Anyways, very interesting place. Nice a cozy. 

We started off with the House salad and the Caprese salad. Wasn't too impressed with the salads at all. Very average. Nothing to write home about. 

We ordered the Four Season's, Carnivore, and Margarita pizza's. All their pizza's are 12 inches and think crust. I think my favorite was the Four Seasons mixed. It had prosciutto, tomatoes, black olives, mushrooms, and artichoke. They usually makes this and puts the toppings in four different sections. Get it four seasons. Hahaha. We asked for it to be mixed so everyone gets a little taste of everything. Really loved this pizza. Loved the toppings but the crust really made the pizza. Not sure what they do with the crust but it's really outstanding. Loved it. 

We also had the Carnivore pizza. It had pepperoni, Italian sausage, ham, and salami. Loved the thinly sliced meats with that great crust. Yum yum good. Lastly, we had the Margarita pizza. Down right good cheese pizza with da crust. 

We gobbled all those salads and pizzas down in a flash. So good that we ordered another Four Season's pizza. Oh yea and we gobbled that down too. 

The service could have been better. I'm thinking that it was really the kitchen that was the hold up. Took a little bite of time to get our pizzas on our tables but I guess it's a little understandable cause the place was packed. I guess it was okay cause we had two separate tables and ordered 8 pizzas together which must have bogged down the kitchen. 

So this is a nice little place with a fairly decent seating, great pizza, wouldn't recommend the salads, and okay service. If looking for a really good pizza then give it a try. I really liked it. I will probably be back."}
{"text":"We tried out a nearby Pizza place tonight, Began's Classic Italian Pizza. It's tucked away in a dying strip mall on Baseline, west of McClintock. You really would need to know it's there to find it. 

I was expecting a strip mall kind of joint but was quite pleasantly surprised by the place. It's very nice, well decorated and perfect for a romantic dinner. They have an outside patio and seats at the bar in addition to ten or so tables inside. 

We split the Mediterranean Mix appetizer which was Feta Cheese, a selection of olives and a basket of warm, soft and tasty bread. It was a nice starter that we followed with the Diavola Pizza. That was topped by homemade Italian sausage, pepperoni, crushed red peppers, jalapenos, fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce. Really good!

The pizzas are 12 inches so plenty for two. We actually only ate half of it and are saving the rest for breakfast. My friend enjoyed a nice glass of Chianti with her meal and they have a pretty good wine selection.

The service was friendly and efficient. Our server told us they've been open for seven years. I can see why they've managed to do so despite the location.

Total cost of our meal (I had water) was $31 which is a great value for the food quality, quantity and service."}
{"text":"We tried Classic Italian Pizza for dinner last night.  We shared an appetizer of Aglio Olio and got two pies.  The appetizer was really good-the dipping oil is pumpkin seed oil based and has fresh minced garlic and a little fresh jalapeno for a bit of zing.  

We could all use a bit of zing infused in our days, don't you think?

I ordered the prosciutto pizza with kalamata added.  It was so good that after we got the check and my leftovers were boxed up I opened the box and grabbed another slice to scarf while I waited for the server to return.

The four slices that made it home didn't even make it to see the next morning ;-("}
{"text":"This was super disappointing. After being told by friends this place was good, we had a Caprese salad which is not very appetizing and then a four seasons Pizza where it was clear that all of the vegetables came out of cans and had virtually no flavor . It was almost no mozzarella cheese on the pizza and the tomatoes were watery and unripe. All in all very disappointing."}
{"text":"After living in the neighborhood for almost 10 years and seeing this place daily on my way to work I just never felt compelled to stop in. In the past I had received mixed reviews from friends and checking out the menu there just wasn't an overt draw for me. 

Then the Groupon showed up... OK that and I do love to support a local mom and pop place... My nephew and I dined there this evening. Our meal included: 
A raspberry Italian soda for him, water for me. For an appetizer we shared the Mediterranean Mix (Olives and Feta) with fresh baked bread (Yummy!) I am convinced that there must be some type of additive that makes this bread addictive! The Olives and Feta were good... but just that olives and feta.. I guess I expected more of a tapenade... this was more of a split plate of olives with pits on one side and feta on the other. I also ordered the dinner salad... it was OK but not worth the $7.75 and the house dressing was no bueno! Oily mess! Stuck with the balsamic vinegar that was already on the table. 
We shared a pizza. Figured we would keep it simple. Ordered the Margarita with 1/2 Italian Sausage. Margarita for me, sausage for him. The waitress (Tomi) asked if we would like fresh basil on it... ABSOLUTELY! Apparently our order was a source of confusion since when the pizza came out it had onion, peppers, mushrooms and sausage on it... My nephew is not a fan! We explained this to our waitress that we did not believe that this was our pizza and she seemed extremely put out... I explained again that we wanted 1/2 cheese and 1/2 Italian sausage. She took it back to the pizza cook who quite loudly told the waitress that it was not the order that she wrote down. She did come back and explained that apparently there is a pizza on there menu that is specifically called the Italian sausage that comes with all the other stuff and apologized for the mix up. Oh well, no worries... So the second pizza came and this time was closer but still not quite right... No fresh basil... Now that I think about it neither one had the fresh basil on it. Why offer it if you are not going to write it down??? Pizza was mediocre... Definitely had better. 
My nephew said that the Italian sausage (apparently made in house) was really good and he seemed to enjoy it. Margarita pizza is just a plain cheese pizza... nothing special, nothing fancy. The crust was good though. 
We ended the dinner with a shared slice of the tiramisu. It was good... definitely could tell that it was made in house. My nephew really enjoyed it and stated that it was the best he has had so far. 
Total bill... Just under $43.00. 
I would go back but not sure that I would recommend it or would rush back."}
{"text":"I have been going to this hard to find place for years.  It was recommended by a friend from the frist moment I bit into the crispy crust I was hooked. 
I will talk about the food in a moment but my favorite part of Classic Italian is that I have introduced some other friends to this place and they went on to be hard, hard core regulars.  Dinning there a few times a week for about five years now.  

The pizza is European Style.  Individual pizza, thin crust with fresh toppings.  I especially love the fresh Prosucitto and basil pie. 
Their Tomato salad is excellent and the bread sticks and mariana sauce is some of the best in town.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to the new location after not having been to Classic Italian for several years. I discovered that they had new ownership.  I was a little disappointed because I wanted to say hello to Azhar. However, I found the new digs to be quite nice.  I was worried that with new ownership the food quality might slip a little. I was pleasantly surprised to find the food to be consistent and as good as I remembered with one small exception.  When I would order pizza with prosciutto it always came with nice slices on top. Delicious. Last night the Margherita                                                                                         
Pizza with added prosciutto ($5 extra) contained a few small chucks of Prosciutto barley visable to the eye. 

One nice enhancement is an expanded craft beer selection and I don't recall them severing French Onion soup before."}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. In. The. Valley. Period.

I adore the Began's, as I've known them prior to taking ownership of Classic Italian Pizza. Several years ago, I even had my college graduation there. Over the years, Ahzar has added in multiple improvements and menu changes, making it one of the best pizza and wine spots in the valley. Bread is hand made, Mozzerella is fresh, and tiramisu is made fresh daily as well (A 2 hour process).

I love the White Pizza, as well as the four seasons. Their tuna salad nicoise and caprese are also must haves. 

Ultimately, I would put it up against Pizzeria Bianco any day of the week. Classic Italian Pizza is fantastic."}
{"text":"Most of us only have so much time that we can sacrifice for food. If you have at least 4 hours that you can devote to pizza, go to Pizzeria Bianco. If you can't devote half your waking hours to dinner and are willing to give up bit of perfection, go to Classic Italian Pizza.

Go with a group and share different pizzas to try out what they have. Each pizza will have its own partisans by the end of the night

The crust could stand to be a bit crispier, the toppings a bit more assertive, the ambiance a bit more polished. But I walked out satisfied and with a whole evening left to enjoy."}
{"text":"I love Classic Italian Pizza. Their pizza is consistently good. Every time the crust is crispy and never soggy. The pizza always tastes fresh and delicious so I love going to eat there. I also love that this place is never too crowded. Their tiramisu is also delicious. It is a hidden gem. Tonight I went to Grimaldi's and their pizzas were definitely not comparable. Grimaldi's was heavy and soggy. It felt like I had eaten a brick after leaving, much too heavy. I will continue to frequent Classic Italian and probably avoid Grimaldi's for a while."}
{"text":"This is some fantastic pizza. The quality of cheese and sauce is exceptional, and the crust is pretty much spot-on. We get the four cheese, subbing in red sauce, and oh man is it a treat.

Service here is always unflinchingly polite and fast and overall awesome.

I only have a couple gripes, and they're extremely minor: For one, they can't come up with a way of providing me an extra side of red sauce without basically making it a bread appetizer order for an extra $5 or so. Not a huge deal, but not a great way to handle that, and I love to dip the pizza slices in the sauce. Two, their regular black iced tea situation is not one I'm fond of. I think it's unsweetened fountain iced tea which I'm not crazy about. It's made worse by the fact that I keep forgetting and keep ordering it. Three, it's just a bit pricey, but this could be primarily because I'm tacking on a bread appetizer every time. Overall, a single pizza is plenty for me and the girl.

And oh the pizza. The four cheese is just heaven. Some of the best ricotta I've had, mixed lovingly with a few others, including a mean mozzarella. Everything going on with the pizza is just fantastic. The appetizers are great too. (It should be noted that, at least the four cheese pizza does NOT keep at all: the cheeses are too liquidy/fresh to store for any period of time, so keep that in mind and devour the whole thing. It won't be a problem.)

Overall this is a great find with a cute interior in a weird location. They're apparently moving when Big Lots finishes their move so we'll see how that goes but we keep coming back and they keep bringing the goods."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and Wine place. Very similar to Bianco but without the ridiculous wait at Bianco. Nice patio. Brick-oven pizza with high quality ingredients. One of the best Pizza places in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Rude waitress dry pizza, \"must order beer and wine to make pizza taste better\". Yea, she literally aid that after we were getting our check and she asked how it was. We said \"decent I suppose\" not wanting to be rude.

Oh well. This place is overpriced and not very good."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time. Food was pretty good but not good enough for the real slow service and the completely arrogant and rude owner. I prefer to to have my pizza without a side of **shole."}
{"text":"The ambience is great here. I had the arugula salad and it was light and refreshing. The pizza is delicious."}
{"text":"***************Hidden Gem Alert****************************

So I totally don't want to review this place because it is a hidden gem. The food I tasted last night was great.  I started with prosciutto wrapped asparagus which was good had some balsamic and oil that they were sitting on to add to the flavor.  I mean anything wrapped with prosciutto or bacon is an A+ in my book.  

On to the pizza Jared R. and I went.  We shared the Diavola pizza which was house made sausage, pepperoni, jalapenos, and crushed red pepper.  The pie is made in the brick oven that you can see which is cool.  It is a thin crust pie and the outside crust comes out nice and crispy.  I see a few write that they compare it to Bianco's and I would have to agree that it is on that elite level of pizza.  

I had a couple glasses of Frenzy wine which was a Sav Blanc and very tasty.  The drink menu looks great lot's of items I wanted to try but on a Thursday night it was hard to consider them.  

I will be back very often as pizza is my favorite and these guys do it right.  So make the trip and discover the great food they put out."}
{"text":"I moved to Tempe, AZ a few months ago from New Jersey and this is the best pizza I have had here.  The ingredients are very fresh and the atmosphere is really nice.  It's a small restaurant with a friendly staff.  This place is good for a date or a group of people.  I recommend the spinach pizza.  My only complaint is that this restaurant doesn't open until 5pm.

Also, it is a little pricey and 1 pizza is not enough for 2 people."}
{"text":"If you have not found yourself in Began's Classic Italian Pizza, it stands to reason you might be wasting your life.

From the crust to the toppings, every ingredient in this pizza is superior to the rest. Great food, great bar, just a hands down great restaurant. If you've never been, you're missing something special. If you haven't been lately (or haven't tried the new location), come down for a pizza and a Karlovacko, you will never be disappointed."}
{"text":"I did like this place a lot. Given that it wasn't crowded when we went there we also received some good service and great recommendation from the chef. We ordered their garlic bread, the special pizza and the tiramisu topped off with the house wine.

All came out perfect. If i wanted to quibble, I would suggest a bit more seasoning (and roasting of garlic) on their garlic concoction. I wouldn't rank this above Bianco's but given that the wait time and service overall a much better experience here. Sometimes the wait times at Bianco's really get to me."}
{"text":"Ok, so this week the BF and I decided to do a little comparison. We ate at Classic Italian Pizza on Tues. night, as we had a Groupon (yay!), and then went to Pizzeria Bianco on Wed night. We got to this restaurant a bit late (9 pm) and it was pretty empty, just one other table who were finishing up. I ordered a red sangria, which was very good, and the bf got a good beer that was Croatian... interesting. We decided to get two pizzas, a margherita pizza and a garlic and basil pizza because we couldn't compromise on any of the more fancy pizzas, but did agree that we wanted to try something with sauce and something without. They were both alright, but not as good as I expected from the reviews. The margherita was a little disappointing because it was just like a cheese pizza.... I expect the margherita to have islands of mozz and sliced tomatoes... this was just like a plain cheese pizza. It still tasted fine. The garlic was better, in my opinion. It was very garlicky and the cheese was tasty. We finished with the tiramisu which was good, but again, not the best I've ever had. (I guess better than Bianco, since they don't even have that as an option...) The tiramisu was melty and you could really taste the alcohol which was good at first, but a bit too strong as we got to the end of the dessert. So overall, sorry guys, I gotta say Bianco was better.... but this is a great alternative if you don't want to wait for hours and or are in mesa. I will actually be more likely to return here than Bianco because of the wait and my location...."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I have been twice with my girlfriend and will defiantly be back. The service is consistently good. The food is made with high quality ingredients and cooked in a wood burning oven. They also have a unique beer selection! It can be tough to find though. It is tucked in the back corner of a shopping center. They do have a small patio that is nice in the spring and fall."}
{"text":"I read about Classic Italian Pizza in a magazine saying it was one of the best pizza places in the Phoenix Metro Area.  Being HUGE Pizzeria Bianco fans, we heard a lot of talk that this place was just as good.  It's not.

A few days after reading about Classic Italian Pizza, we saw a Groupon and figured fate had intervened and was telling us to get our butts to this place!  We went on a Friday evening right when they opened at 5 PM.  We were surprised at it's tucked-away location in a strip mall that's way past it's peak time.  But, these are the types of places we love - family-owned, unique and *hopefully* amazing food and service.  That's why I love Yelp so much - it helps my family find these places and myself when I'm traveling for work.  

Back to the visit.  We showed up a few minutes prior to 5 PM and were just walking around outside waiting for them to open.  Some of the employees were sitting outside on the patio and we got a less-than-comfortable stare down from them and at 4:59, one of said employees opened the door and said, \"You know we open at 5, right?\"  Umm, yes, I do know that's why we're not pressing our faces against the glass wondering why nobody is letting us in...  In other words: a less than desirable start to this experience.

We overlooked the menu (and had done so online already) and decided to go with the Aglio Oglio appetizer, a Margherita Pizza and a Vegetarian Pizza.  With our high expectations and all the comparisons to Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, we were super excited to get started.  

The Aglio Oglio was AMAZING.  Pumpkin seed oil infused with fresh garlic and jalapeños - FANTASTIC!  Something we'll definitely try to mimic at home.  It came with freshly baked bread (from the wood fire oven, I assume) that was also killer.  A great start.  \"Bring on the pizza\", we thought! 

And when it was brought, our high expectations were shattered.  In a bad way.  The Margherita Pizza was as expected in terms of initial appearance.  You can't really screw that up.  The Vegetarian Pizza, however, didn't look too appetizing.  Why?  Because it looked like ingredients from a frozen pizza.  The mushrooms didn't appear to be anything but baked, the over abundance of black olives was less than appealing, and the sliced tomato was just there - nothing extraordinary.  

The taste is where it all fell apart.  With expectations set that it's true, authentic, Italian pizza in a wood-burning oven and an immediate analogy to Pizzeria Bianco, the taste was not remotely where we expected.  The wood burning oven taste was not there.  There wasn't the smoky flavor you'd expect.  It was just, pizza.  In fact, we could've drove twenty less miles and had a much better pizza in Chandler at La Stalla.  Or drove ten more miles and went to Bianco.  For our two pizzas, at least, the true potential of the 800+ degree wood burning oven was not met.

Bad?  No.  Good?  I guess.  Top notch and worthy of 'Top Ten Lists' for the USA?  Absolutely not.  No way.  No how."}
{"text":"This place is a total hidden gem. The food is fantastic, and it's so cozy and intimate -- perfect for date night. The decor is beautiful, nice and dark with a big brick oven. 
The best thing on the menu is the prosciutto pizza - if you're into prosciutto, you're going to die over this pizza. Thin crust and perfect!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the new location at McClintock & Guadalupe. Really nice dining experience. Staff were very attentive and friendly. We learned that the biz was sold  to new owners who plan to transition to a new name and changes to the menu in fall '17.  They assured us that some of the favorite menu items would be retained.   

For an appetizer, we had the brick oven bread with tomato sauce as an appetizer....delicious! The sauce had a touch of balsamic & olive oil on top. 
Three of us split the arugula salad, and it was a very generous serving for each. Very fresh & tasty. 
For pizza, our choice was the Greek.  It tasted great.  If you like a thin \"artisan like\" crust you will enjoy this pizza. I used the leftover tomato sauce to dip my pizza in. 
The only negative was that the happy hour specials advertised on the website did not seem to match reality, e.g. $4 off any appetizer.  If so, they need to update their website.  Some people might get ticked off.  You may want to confirm before you order, I just let it go. 
All in all, a good meal, good service. Definitely worth another visit.  I really want to support local non \"chain\" businesses."}
{"text":"If the Diavola pizza wasn't good, I would have only left 1 star. I arrived with my dinner guest for a Friday night dinner at 8:15p.  It took the server 5-10 minutes to acknowledge us, and she was unprofessional and awkward. Instead of a hello, or welcome, I was greeted with \"do you want to order, or can I get you drinks\"? When we ordered our pizza, and she continued to suggest that we order a salad because the pizza would take awhile, I should have known I'd be in for a long night. By the time our order was placed, it was 8:25.  Our appetizer (aglio olio-standard, not awesome) came in a timely fashion. After eating the bread, drinking my drink, and thinking to myself \"huh, its been a while\"...I glanced at the time. It was 9:10.  I proceeded to watch a man at another table raise his hand for service, and hold it up for nearly 3m. It was 9:30 by the time my pizza came. An hour to bring out a pizza is outrageous. You only have one opportunity to make a first impression Classic Italian, and you lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"Everyone knows that I love pizza & vino, so if you share my love for a great  pie and a glass of grape juice look no further for your next big night out.  Classic Italian is well hidden under the clock tower in the Waterworks mall at Baseline/Lakeshore rd. in Tempe AZ. but well worth finding.  The pizzas are hand stretched & prepared in a wood fire brick oven using Pecan wood!  My favorte of the bunch is called the 4 Seasons, wow what a pizza.  The crust is delicate & thin, the house made sauce is wonrderful and there is always a reasonably priced bottle of wine to pair with everything on the menu.  The ambiance is comfortable and the service has always been good.  A great place for date night! DO IT!"}
{"text":"So, we had a groupon and decided to check this place out. We ordered a bottle of wine from their \"neck of the woods\" which I believe was Croatian. We got the pumpkin seed oil, garlic and serranos. Although It was pretty tasty with the peppers, I thought the garlic was to chunky. There were huge hunks of it and it really took over. We then got a house salad. blah....green leaf lettuce, once again huge hunks, onion, tomato and cucumber. I didnt really taste dressing. Maybe a little red wine vinaigrette ? Extremely forgettable. We ordered a hatch chili pizza with sausage and a margherita pizza. They put the basil on and THEN cooked it. So that was strange. Usually the basil is sprinkled fresh on top. The hatch chili pizza worked. The flavors were great together. Sarah was our server and she was fantastic! All in all, We all agreed it was ok, but nothing special and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza and drinks around!   Thank you for re-opening and look forward to seeing you in February."}
{"text":"I was excited to see Classic Italian's return to Tempe and even more excited to see that they were at my favorite intersection -- so many great businesses right here.

Went in yesterday with my mom for happy hour. Sounded like they had some great specials ($5 off pizza, $4 off apps, $3 off wine, $2 off beer).

Like the old location, I think the prices on their pizzas are still high. Although the happy hour price makes it more reasonable -- I'd probably be more likely to come back for happy hour vs dinner. Pizza's good, but there are other places in the valley with better pizza at a better price."}
{"text":"nice place.  Pizza was okay.  Seems like it might be better for a late night, or happy hour venue than a place for a nice dinner.  The crust, while a little thin for my taste, was very good.  The wine list was average.  This is a place that I may visit again, but it is not someplace to go out of your way to try"}
{"text":"The calzones are awesome!  Great wine and beer selection and very friendly staff.  Pizza is good but crust was a little underdone."}
{"text":"My friends decided to get some pizza after a comedy show. I wasn't happy with the idea at first since I am not a fan of pizza. Boy! Was I wrong. Their pizzas and appetizers are so delicious and I cannot wait to go back there again. Service is awesome and the waitress was very attentive. 

I highly recommend any pizza lover to come here"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, tasty pizza. Very impressed.

I never went to the old location, so I don't have a frame of reference, but the new Classic Italian gets a recommendation from me. The service was prompt, and everything tasted great. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
