{"text":"Delightful!  Q to Go is a sweet little cafe in the heart of Renfrew.  Serves Italian panini, pizza, soups, salads and pasta - both to eat in and for take-away.  I had the Lombardia panini - with the Bresaola, mozzarella, arugula, EVOO. Very delicious!  The prices are very reasonable.  So glad to have this in the 'hood!  Also had a cappuccino - for me it rivaled the cappuccino I get from Phil & Sebastian's."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this place has closed. It was a good little neighbourhood place though."}
{"text":"Great place with authentic Italian food- some of the best pizza I've ever had! Definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys great Italian food and nice people! Try it out :)"}
{"text":"Small quaint location in renfrew! Closed at 5:30 but will stay open if has customers!! Panini was fantastic had a chicken one!! And they have pizza, gnocchi, and lasagna.. Coffee, espresso, and pop beverages! They are a nice Italian couple, and did me a huge favour!! They don't take debit, credit and cash only, but I highly recommend this place!! They have small seating outside too!!"}
