{"text":"Rover's Bar and Grill Rockies lounge is under new ownership and has a new name it is now Rovers Bar and Grill.  We came here for the fish on Fridays but the new owner now gets his fish from Alaskan fisheries. The fish is never frozen. This place is now THE place for a great fish dinner or fish sandwich."}
{"text":"Italian dinners, American, endless soup and salad bar is great. Most food for your dollar. I highly recommend. Great bar. Good place to watch a game. The bar can get quite noisy in the evenings, but it adds to the great atmosphere at Rocky's"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! I have never walked into and establishment where you have to figure out where the dinning room is and then have to figure out who to speak with to find a table. Once we asked someone where to sit they pointed us to a booth. Once seated it took 5 minutes just to get someone to take our drink order. Then a server just walked in and clocked in and took our order. We ordered the special fish on a dish. The service was lacking but did get better once the other sever clocked in.  We ordered and our food arrived at our table with 10 minutes of ordering. The food was good. The fish was fried just right and the peorogie were good but the mac m cheese lacked flavor. I would recommend this place for the food but not for the service."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fish sandwich that can feed three people, Rocky's is your place! I've never seen any other fish sandwich that comes with three large, whole pieces of fish. They only give you one small hamburger bun for all that fish, but I ain't complaining; the fish is where it's at! If you prefer a breaded, not battered, fish filet then you'll love Rocky's. The flavors were mild, not at all too fishy, which, to me, tasted fresh. For a few dollars more, you can get fries but if you're not sharing your sandwich, I would probably skip the fries as they're just your ordinary diner fries and was way too much food for one person.   I imagine Rocky's to be a busy place during lent season and I definitely plan to return for the ginormous fish sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great local bar. Theresa does a great job. Sandwiches are excellent. Recommend meatball, reuben, burger, fish sandwiches."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a million times over the years. Have been there during the years it was less than clean, to the present where it is almost clean. This place is a neighborhood standard that for some reason compels you to return, even if your experience was less than stellar. Fancy it is not. Gourmet it is definitely not. Every item on the menu seems to come from a can, bag ,bucket or box. The wait staff is often clueless and changes like the wind. I have never had the same server twice. But the fact is you get a decent meal for a decent price and always have a little to take home. Yes, the salad bar is very basic. Not every item is a fresh as it should be. The iced tea often takes on the taste of Lord knows what. However,  the fried fish dinner is one of the best I have had anywhere in Picksburg. Their meatloaf is terrific as are several of their hoagies. In a nutshell, this place has a lot of flaws. Like we all do. A few upgrades like a better wait staff, fresh gravy instead of their gallon bucket brand, homemade sauce instead of whatever canned stuff they are using would jump this review to 5 stars. Rocky's is worth going to. You will definitely find something you like and you will definitely go back. Decent food, decent price, good portions and an overall pleasant experience."}
{"text":"If you are searching for a go to fish place for Lent....look no further.  This place will give you the best fish sandwich in Pittsburgh.  The sandwich has enough fish to make four sandwiches.  You will not be able to finish this sandwich in one seating. Enjoy...."}
{"text":"The new owner of what is now called Rover's really hit it out of the park when he improved the fish sandwich by 100%! His approach to evolutionize and not revolutionize with subtle yet needed improvements to this well established corner bar and restaurant have impressed many.  Keep up the good work Steve!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with this place since it changed ownership & became \"Rover's\".  My husband & I have been steady customers for many years.  But under new ownership it has changed for the worse.  I was hungry for pasta & we went for dinner today.  I ordered Linguine & Meatballs ($14.95) & my husband ordered Chicken Parmigiana (also $14.95).  The portion was very large for the chicken parm but my portion was less.  The marinara sauce was bland & missing something.  We boxed the pastas to take them home.  Worse than the bland food was the service.  April was so intent on serving the booth next to us & then others who arrived after us that we were practically ignored.  We weren't asked about our food & needed to track her down for bread that should be served with Italian pastas.  The only time she approached our table on her own was to bring us a check because she was cleaning all her booths (by this time they were empty except for us) so she could go home because her relief came in.  We are above average tippers and this wasn't the first time April waited on us.  We gave some of the pasta & sauce to our dog when we got home.  He wasn't thrilled with it either. I doubt that we will return again."}
{"text":"To be clear this is not a fancy place by any means. The decor is a little dated and leaves a lot to be desired. The food is basic and simple, but it is delicious. Sometimes simple is better; This is definitely one of those times."}
{"text":"Rocky's has been in business since the 1980s and still going strong.  Their food is good.  Not haute cuisine, pretentious!  Everyday, well prepared and taste bud pleasing home style cooking.  I've mostly gone during supper hours and  and ate in the dining room, but, today I introduced an old friend to \"linner\" in the bar. He ordered the large version of fish sandwich.  Rocky's is famous for their fish.  Three large breaded and fried fish filets, bun and fries for under $10.  Needless to say, he had no complaints and brought home more than he ate. I ordered the meatball grill.  It was delish.  Served on thick cut Italian bread and made \"grilled cheese\" (mozzarella) style.  Meatballs and tomato sauce are both good!  Also, served with fries.  I brought home half the sandwich. Another good meal there.  Friends, mother, and former boss all enjoy their food!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for chicken tenders and fries.  Big order, ready in 10-15 minutes.  Heard their fish is good too."}
{"text":"Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. 'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.  On the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.  Well, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.  The second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.  I was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.  We hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.  The mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip.   After the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'.   Well, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.  Thank goodness for the basic salad bar.  Even my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.  The irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.  Third base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.  From what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. But apparently, mama has left the kitchen."}
{"text":"This is a great little gem!  On my last visit to Pittsburgh I was looking for a nice bar/pub/lounge to grab dinner and watch a Penguins playoff game.  A friend of mine who lived in the area recommended Rocky's.  As I walked in the door I was pleasantly approached by the server and shown a table. It was clean, welcoming and the lounge was busy. It was Friday night and the special was the fish fry.  I ordered the fish and in the meantime I sipped on a draft brew.  The order was delivered to my table in no time.  The fish and sides were tasty and the portion size was large. As I was watching the game and enjoying the heck out of my dinner I noticed a dessert case with a nice selection of cakes.  Well needless to say I got a togo box for what was left of my dinner and ordered a slice of cheesecake.  Another good choice!  At the end of night the Penguins couldn't pull off the win over the Rangers but I definitely have a new \"go to\" when I'm in town.  Another star could be added for a smoke free environment.  I don't smoke but I understand they have a nice outdoor area for those who do."}
