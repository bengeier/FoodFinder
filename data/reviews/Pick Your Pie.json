{"text":"Pick Your Pie is now one of my go-tos for an affordable quick delicious sweet treat. The staff was super helpful and was willing and ready to answer any questions that we had. If you've never been there before, or are just unsure as to what you want, they do allow you to sample so no worries about choosing something that you may not like. If you don't like pie, this can still be a great place to go to as they have plenty of choices available to make a customized dessert. It was a stress free experience which is exactly the way it should be when dessert's involved. I really hope they stick around for awhile."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Chose crust, crepe, or put crust chips to dip in filling. Then pick your filling (chocolate, vanilla, key lime, and other fruit fillings), then choose a topping)   Fillings are delicious! Chocolate was really high quality, smooth with great chocolate. Our kids loved splitting a dip (crunch pie crust strips to dip in a filling). Prices are great too. Will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife brought me back a \"pie\" from here last night. While it isn't a true pie and is more of a parfait, it was still super tasty and I'd recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Pick Your Pie is a lot like the fix your own frozen yogurt concepts, but with pie. Yeah, with pie. There's a good selection of crusts, fillings, and toppings, and you can even get the fruit fillings warmed up if you like--just make sure to ask before you add anything that could melt. The pie was delicious and the service was fantastic. Definitely worth a try if you get the opportunity."}
{"text":"This place is pretty terrible.  I took my wife and 2 kids there for something fun.  They had folding tables out with some cheap buffet servers.  The staff was not present when we got there.  Shortly after we got in, a young man working there can running out of the back buttoning up his pants.  He apologized and said he was in the bathroom.  We called him out that he didn't wash his hands after using the bathroom and he became angry with us, but I'm sorry, if you wash your hands after using the restroom I would think your pants would already be buttoned.  I found this place to be dirty, staff unprofessional and the \"pie\" looked like they opened a can of pie filling and put it out on a buffet line.    Not what I was expecting at a place that has much better reviews on Yelp."}
{"text":"Delish!  My family loved what we got- sort of like a sundae made with pie filling instead of ice cream.  I loved the vanilla cream with strawberry topping and my daughter gobbled her 'chips' (like a sugar cookie chip) with chocolate cream.  The staff was super friendly and walked us through the options patiently since it was our first time there.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is not make your own pie but it is make your own delicious parfait. I wish there was mini pie crusts to full as you wish; that would be DIY pie. All the ingredients we tried or added to our desserts were very good quality, often made from scratch and delicious. We liked our desserts but when we thought we would get pie and did not, we are slightly disappointed. Friendly and welcoming staff and clean and tidy shop."}
{"text":"YUM, new twist on an old love. 3 styles of pie, built from scratch, overly delicious! Friendly staff. Fill out a pie card to have your pie featured as Pie of the Day."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I decided to stop by and give it a try.  I was skeptical and was not sure what to choose and whether my combination will work.  However, it did and I am now a fan of Pick Your Pie.  The staffs are friendly and helpful.  They understand your hesitation on this new concept.  After visiting it few more times, it is a fun concept and great idea that you can make your own desert.  I like the fact that the filling is not too sweet.  If you haven't been Pick your pie yet, please stop by a give a try.  I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do."}
{"text":"Okay, so I am a little on the fence between the three and four stars.  For safety sake, I am going with three which is still good.  I think maybe another trip or two and I will get more firmly planted.  So first, this is 'not' a traditional pie, it does come in a cup.  They are clear about that on their website, but if you didn't investigate...now you know.    So let me walk it down.  You actually create your own pie in a cup.  You pick the crust (gram cracker, gingerbread ...), then you pick your filling of chocolate cream, vanilla cream, swirl, various fruits and so on.  Mine was Key Lime.  Then it is off to the toppings, toasted coconut, sprinkles, marshmallows. ..  All of this comes in layers.    So I had the gram cracker,  key lime and toasted coconut.  It was awesome.  The only issue is that this should go in a normal pie crust, but that is not an option.  They also have pastry strips if you prefer and do make a wrap/crepe.   So my warning is this...this is fresh pie filling and not pudding.  So it is dense and heavy.  Do not let your eyes gout out in front of your stomach.  It is a great concept and you can take your pie on the road with you.  The cost is not too bad and the service is fantastic."}
{"text":"Pretty fun concept but even more impressive is that most stuff is made in-house.  Start with pie crust crumbs in a variety of flavors, add some filling, and add toppings.  Think:  Menchie's of pie.  Not a full pie mind you although they do sell them (but in my opinion they do not advertise them enough...they are $12 apiece so given that they are the most expensive items I would up the visibility of those).  I asked if the full pie selection was available on their Web site and I was told no.  Big miss.   I think this is a novel concept but whether it extends beyond the trend of build-your-own remains to be seen.  In the meantime, I will gladly have more of their vanilla cream filling.  Yummo."}
{"text":"I actually have visited here several times even though the drive is half an hour. All of the ingredients are natural, with no imitation flavorings. The vanilla custard filling is out of this world. Put that on a crepe with the pure strawberry topping and whipped cream, it is heaven. Husband loves the vanilla in graham cracker crust with bananas and caramel topping. The prices are very reasonable. So worth stopping and checking it out. I never would have guessed, just driving by."}
{"text":"I've had \"do-it-yourself\" ice cream treats at various places, but I've never had a \"Do-it-Yourself\" PIE before.  Thus is the charm of Pick Your Pie.   Located on Mayfield road, this little, unassuming places allows to you make mini-pies from the ground up, starting crust combinations, a variety of fillings (hot or cold, according to your likings,) from fruit to vanilla and chocolate, and then topped with a gaggle of goodies.  If a pie's not your preference, then you can have any of these awesome things mixed into a piping hot crepe as well. They also do parties and cater with mini-pies, made to order.  Parking is small, but it's worth the trip, and the folks there are really nice and knowledgeable about their product.   So, if you're looking for a different dessert, whether yer girl or guy, then keep out an eye for the great Pick Your Pie!   :)"}
{"text":"Just had our employee appreciation day catered by Pick your Pie.  We had the Pie Bar set up where we had the choice of Crust: graham cracker, peanut butter, vanilla, or chocolate chip cookie; Filling: Vanilla cream, chocolate cream, cheesecake, or apple; Toppings: Candied pecans, crumb, chocolate chips, and whipped cream.  What a new, fun, and delicious experience!"}
{"text":"Do not get a cheesecake. They didn't even have a pie crust. He just sprinkled mashed graham crackers on bottom of pan. Not sure what the cheesecake actually is. Make the mistake of getting cherries but sadly they aren't red."}
{"text":"The concept was just ok.  I expected pie, and that's not what this place delivers.  Maybe if the name were different, I would have not had my heart set on PIE.   There are 3 options; parfait style dessert, crepe, or fruit filling dip.  The parfait includes layers of fruit filling and pita style cinnamon chips, layered in a clear cup.  The dip consists of fruit filling and pita chips for scooping.  I opted for the crepe.  There were a number of filling choices, cream or fruit.  The filling was wrapped in a homemade crepe, drizzled with caramel sauce and topped with whipped cream for $5.00.   The portion was ample for the price, but I just didn't care for the dessert.  The crepe was spongey, the apple filling was cold and didn't have very much texture, kinda like chunky apple sauce, the caramel sauce was very thin, so it pooled on the bottom of the container instead of sticking to the crepe.   My suggestion would have been a  warm, chunky/chopped fruit filling drizzled in a thick caramel sauce topped with ice cream.  The concept is great but I think that pita chips are a poor substitute for real pie crust  and as I mentioned the crepe could be so much better with just a tweak to the components.   I couldn't finish the dessert, just didn't work for me.   I gave this review 3 stars because the concept is good, the place is cute and the staff is really nice."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's always super clean and the staff is very friendly. The pies from the build your own selection aren't quite pies, but who cares. They are absolutely delicious and have made from scratch filling options! Apparently you can get them made as crepes as well, but I've never tried that.  I love my lil cup of pie too much to bother with that!"}
{"text":"This is the ultimate for pie lovers. Ignore any bad reviews. This is the dessert place. Build your own pie.   You get a bowl then you can add different crusts, fillings and toppings. Pay by ounce like menchies.  Plus they cater for events which is such a change up from normal catering with cakes or brownies. Bring in a pie bar and watch your people's eyes open up.  I am probably their #1 consumer.  Just wish they were open on Sundays."}
{"text":"I ordered the crêpe and it was delicious. The gentleman behind the counter was very helpful and enthusiastic about his product. Really if you don't like what you order it's your fault because you choose your own ingredients. It was delicious. The facility was very clean and the service was great."}
{"text":"Cute place! Pie was delish! We came in on Tuesday and they run a special on Tuesdays so our weigh ins were only 25 cents! Clean and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for the first time recently. The food was amazing! The concept is similar to Menchies as you create your own pie from a variety of crust types, pie fillings, and toppings. Both of us kept it simple and did some sort of apple pie. We both were extremely pleased with the outcome. Everything was fresh, the place was really clean, and the owner was really nice. We will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"What a Surprise!! Didnt know it was set up to make your own creation now!!  Love it and its sold by the weight! I will be making many more visits here!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place and i had high hopes. I ordered a pie here and was told it would take 10 minutes to make at 5pm. It took 35 minutes for me to get my pie and it wasnt because it took long to make its because the workers were on their phones the one guy was on facetime and the other siting down behind the register and when they weren't doing that they were sitting around cracking jokes and talking instead of helping us. They were increadbly rude to us and I even overheard them making fun of a different customer whom had just left."}
