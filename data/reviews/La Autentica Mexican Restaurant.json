{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the food , tacos were delicious, beer was cold . Service was ok, our waitress disappear at one point but she made it up giving us fresh hot chips to go with our left over guacamole haha
We will be back! Taco Tuesday for sure!!"}
{"text":"great mexican food great atmosphere and service love to come here when Im in ballantyne"}
{"text":"Cute almost cafeteria style place. The food was like Taco Bell but served to you. Our server was nice. The drinks were mostly juice, little alcohol. We got tequila shots because the drinks were so bad and the tequila was watered down. I get restaurants want to preserve their liquor by putting water in the bottle but this was too much. If you're looking for fast food imitation Mexican in a cute local spot then this would work."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed the food at this restaurant twice and will come again. The food is very tasty with a little different flavor to their enchilada sauce than some other restaurants. Price is reasonable. They have a full bar and offer lower prices on drink specials from time to time. Chips and salsa delivered immediately. Two salsas are given, one mild and one hot. Large beverage glasses so you don't have to ask for refills all the time. Our food server brought refills without our need to ask. Very attentive. Another employee, Edgar, came to see how we were doing. He is very personable and is an asset to this restaurant. The lower rating is because of the noise level. With tile floors and open space we found it to be noisy and difficult to converse. I suggest that they lower the music to help minimize this problem. Good food, so give it a try."}
{"text":"I have had better Mexican food at Taco Bell.   Being from AZ,  I have never heard of a Chimichanga not fried or Munster cheese in a burrito!  $11 bucks for two tiny unfried Chimichangas is a joke.  Service was horrible, tables sat dirty around us the entire meal,  they had a 30 minute wait even though they had multiple tables open.  Waste of time and money.   We are stopping at Wendy's on the way home."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I came here last night and the food was Really Good and so was the service. He ordered the No Name and I had a combination platter. Both meals were really good! The place was pretty packed for a Sunday night. The portions are huge and the margaritas were too!! 
Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"We love Mexican food, and this is the top of our list now! Everyone in Ballantyne needs to try it.  Our food was delicious and very reasonable. The employees are all so nice. The management gives everyone extra attention to make you feel welcome... Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Finally a decent Mexican restaurant in Indian Land! Fresh, great service, greats margs!!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite hotspot. The service is outstanding. And the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Loud, loud and LOUDER!! I will remember this restaurant for its painfully loud, thumping, dance-club like music along with its totally bland and tasteless guacamole, bland refried beans, bland mild salsa and gratuitously spicy hot salsa. The employees were super nice and friendly and were on the spot for everything you could possibly need, but the volume of the music and flavorless food will be why we don't return. Seems I may be alone in my opinion here on Yelp, but that was our experience. Shame."}
{"text":"I came to this location thinking it would be the same as the location we went to in Indian Trail, NC. Turns out it was not. Must be a chain. Either way, the customer service was good. The server who assisted us was friendly and attentive. I went there expecting legit Mexican food and left very disappointed. It was the cheese that they used that just ruins it. I have no idea what kind of cheese they use, but it does not go well with enchiladas nor quesadillas. I had cheese enchiladas and I couldn't finish them. I noticed the same problem with the cheese at the other location in Indian Trail, but I still decided to give this location a try. I will not be returning for food. However, I may consider returning only for a casual night to have drinks and watch some sports. The ambience does look good for a good sports night. This place is loaded with huge TVs all around."}
{"text":"Great food! Authentic mexican menu and awesome service, too. We  came on a Saturday afternoon and enjoyed live, instrumental music. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Not the most authentic Mexican joint but definitely worth a visit. Taco Tuesdays gets u 1$ tacos with the purchase of a drink which is great. Al pastor and carnitas were my favs. They give you free tortilla chips with a choice of 3 sauces mild hot and the green which is great with pieces of avocado in it. Will be coming back to try the rest!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  Not only is it close enough to walk it it totally worth going.  We have a \"table\" that we request and our waitress Stephanie is attentive and always encourages us to try new options from the menu.  They will tweak anything to your taste or liking....just ask.  The staff and owner are very friendly and we are always treated kindly. Carlos, the bartender, makes fantastic margaritas and the beer is always cold and ready.   It is a must try if you are in the area and if your not it is totally worth the drive.   They have TVs for football and an outdoor seating area that is dog friendly as well.  Sometimes in weekends they even have live music.  Food and drink specials nightly."}
{"text":"So glad to finally get a good Mexican spot out here in Ballantyne. My wife & i have already been about 5-6 times. Its our Friday night go too now!"}
{"text":"My new favorite go to Mexican.  The skinny margarita is amazing!! They have a good authentic beer selection on tap.  All of their food is good. The authentic tacos are delicious and on special on Tuesday's.  The burrito La Unica with Asada (steak) is yummy.  The whole place is clean.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place as I lived on Central Ave 14ish years ago when 1rst opened.  Lake Norman and other locations solid as well"}
{"text":"This could very well be a one-star rating, but it was our first time here and I generally give three-stars if it is A-OK; but La Unica (the only one in English) just might be the only one that came across that way...in a negative sense.

Newly opened we went for lunch.  It was 1pm, so the lunch mob had vacated and there was just one table of six Latinos finishing and two other tables occupied.  Seated, we waited for 15 minutes until our waiter came to our table.  The long wait was a surprise as there were at least four wait persons wandering around, but I guess assigned tables are just that.

The menu looked pretty good.  Lots of selections broken down by category, a lunch menu, a drink menu and a listing of sides.  Pretty much an array you would expect from a Mexican/Latino restaurant.  Attractive and interesting.  We begged off the waiter who came back for more time to read the menu.

Big mistake as he was gone for quite a bit of time.  While gone from our table a couple of ladies were seated nearby, at one of his tables, as he was right on top of their order, got their drinks and did respond to our waving of arms and approached our table to take our order.

Another long wait.  By now it was 1:35 and we were thinking of leaving.

I ordered the Speedy Gonzales special (ironic given how long we languished at our table!).  This was a carnita taco, a cheese enchalada and beans.  You have a choice of beans or rice, and it is extra if you want both.  Wife ordered another special of a chili rellano with beans.  We both had iced tea and those were $2.65 each.  Should have gone for booze!

Again a long wait for the order to appear.  The table with the two women already had their order served while we waited.  They had ordered after we did.  The slow kitchen confirmed to my wife and I that the theme of La Unica was the word \"slow.\"

The food was so-so.  My taco was a room temperature corn tortilla with dry pork pieces and a bit of lettuce.  The encilada just lay dead on the plate, cheese had already solidified and their red sauce was more like a chipolte flavored canned sauce.  

Wife's chili rellano was pretty good.  Stuffed with cheese, that was melted, and the chili was not heavily breaded.  Excellent.  

We both agreed that their beans were very good.  Not totally mashed into paste like found in many Latino restaurants, these were partially mashed but leaving a good amount of beans whole.  And they were flavorful.  Go for the beans v. rice.

We paid at 2:16pm, so the uncrowded lunch took over an hour.  Oddly, we noticed that our receipt showed that we paid at 1:16pm or maybe that was when our waiter took our drink order?

Our neighbors, along with some of the Yelpers rating, gave this place raves.  This is just NOT a five-star experience which equals \"as good as it gets.\"  Golly!  At least one Yelper did mention how slow they were.

We will give it another chance, but I just hate to think that I might pay for another less than satisfactory experience."}
{"text":"When it comes to Tex-Mex, I'm pretty easy, but regardless, this place checks all the right boxes... Friendly staff... Festive, cavernous dining area with enough TVs to put most sports bars to shame... Fresh, warm chips... Aromatic cilantro-laden salsas, both mild and semi-hot... Excellent service by Rosa... The usual Tex-Mex fare including authentic tacos... Generous portions... and Excellent beverages (soda, that is.)

I went with the Super Chimichangas for $10.99. They were served with a side of rice and beans, and everything was indeed super except the chimichangas weren't quite as cispy as I am used to. My wife went with the tacos and cheese dip. Both were good.

The only knock against them was 93 sanitation grade, which as anyone that reads my reviews knows, can be a showstopper for me. As much as I enjoyed everything, I won't be going back unless they improve upon that. Otherwise, I can wholeheartedly give it four stars and recommend it fully."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best Mexican food I've ever had in my life. Great service and amazing food. Highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing.... They have 17 TVs and they are getting the football package... A great environment and everyone is extremely friendly. They have good Mexican food at reasonable prices. 

Try this place out..."}
{"text":"We've been twice since they opened and have not been disappointed. Our first server was wonderful. Very outgoing and friendly. I had the authentic street tacos with chicken and carnitas. Very tender meat and delicious. Chimichanga was good as well. They will bring you three salsas for the chips ( mild, hot and a creamy verde that has some avocados in it. All good. We'll be back."}
{"text":"If you follow a vegan diet like I do, you won't be disappointed here. However, you need to ask for what you want.. the server told me that any entree can be made into a vegetarian dish and from there I asked for no cheese on this and that. I ordered the enchiladas verde....after I told the server I like mushrooms, she suggested a combination of mushrooms, spinach and zucchini in the enchiladas. At home I eat a whole foods plant-based diet with no oil, and the chef accommodated my request for no-oil also. The server didn't blink an eye and provided us with really good service."}
{"text":"I am so excited that they have opened a La Unica here in Ballantyne!!! I used to live in Huntersville and ate at that one 2-3 times a week. Tried out the new location tonight and was very pleased. We got a table right away and had chips and salsa immediately. Their salsa is so good that I used to get it to go for any time I was making Mexican at home and it's just as going at this location. Our server was attentive and pleasant and our food was delivered quickly, hot and delicious. I had the taco, burrito, enchilada combo and my hubby got a chicken fajita salad (not on the menu but they made it for him). If you like good, basic Mexican food, you will love this place as much as I do. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the steak and chicken fajitas off of the lunch menu and it was delicious! Plenty of food served for a very reasonable price. If you're in the Ballantyne area and enjoy Mexican cuisine, I highly recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"La Unica is my favorite restaurant in ballantyne! The food is amazing & the service is great."}
{"text":"Come check it out it's a lot of fun. And don't forget to say hello to Carlos and he will make you a kick ass margarita"}
{"text":"Not a very chill environment I think it is the lighting however the food was awesome."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with the dishonest behavior at this place. My husband and I went there on March 25, a Sunday evening. We ordered 6 tacos to go and a young female hostess took our order. The total was $16.17. We didn't leave a tip because it was a to go order. A few days later, we were very surprising to find that our credit card was charged $21.17 for this transaction. Apparently someone added $5 tip him/herself! So be careful and make sure you double check your credit card bill if you recently went to this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of these places, every time I see one, I stop and eat. Love their food! I'd say I'm a Mexican food snob, growing up in Southern California, with an ex wife from Jalisco, I've been exposed to some pretty good Mexican food, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"First time here, great fajitas and tacos! From Ohio finally a good margarita! We will definitely be back. Great waiter, Alex!"}
{"text":"This place has became our new go to for Mexican in the area. Service is stellar! Try the No Name Plate with a jalapeño margarita! You won't be disappointed! Their chips, salsa and homemade guacamole are delish too!"}
{"text":"Went into the restaurant yesterday and had great food and great service.  I would have given 5 stars but there was a little mistake on my bill and had to work to get it resolved.  Might have been an oversight but still was on unnecessary inconvenience..  Will be back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a girlfriend and had a better experience here. We each ordered off of the lunch menu and it was delicious. I love their hot chunky salsa. I also like their green salsa. I think you have to ask for it. We didn't wait long for our food and service was good!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious and authentic. Service is friendly and fast. It is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I stopped in at La Unica a few weeks ago. We were driving by and noticed this new Restuarant and thought we should try it. My first impression was that it's very nice inside and the staff was very friendly. However they had very slow service and not many people were seated. We got our food and my husbands chicken was over cooked and dry. I had ordered the fish tacos and they were very good in taste however I noticed something crunchy. I wasn't sure if it was bones or what but I ended up not eating them. I was dissappointed because this restuarant was so close to our home and there's not that many Mexican restaurants near to our home. I will probably try this place again but order something different."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant. They catered a party 40+ people at my home. On time, reasonably priced and the BEST customer service. This will be my go to mexican restaurant. So many great compliments on the food."}
{"text":"Formerly, La Unica.  I LOVE this place.  Everything is always so clean, fresh, and delicious.  This is definitely my go to mexican restaurant.  It could be yours too because they have multiple locations all across Charlotte.  They always give you a mild and a hot salsa, which I love mixing together.  They also have a green salsa (which is super spicy) that you can ask for (no charge) which has avocado chunks in it as well.  They have the best tasting chimichanga!  I always get the chicken chimichanga because it's SOO delicious!  It's always so fresh that it tastes healthy! It's located in a little shopping center, but don't let that fool you because the quality of food is amazing.  If you haven't been yet, I highly recommend coming here ASAP!"}
{"text":"Horrible! If I can give a \"0\" I would. They don't use real cheese...you heard me right! Cheese enchiladas with cheese spreads. Refried bean and Mexican Rice are supposed to be vegetarian...sure doesn't taste like that. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food on Ballantyne. Music was a little loud from the live entertainment, but a very festive atmosphere, nonetheless. Food came out quickly and the drinks were reasonably priced and very good. Service was also on point. Definitely looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant in Vallantyne area.
Fresh food, grate prices and amazing service"}
{"text":"Trying to find a good Mexican restaurant in the area but, even though I really wanted to give this guys a good score, I visited them one more time but left disappointed by \"tasteless\" chicken fajitas, my wife left half of her ensalada because no matter how much sauce she added, was still not good and my kids basically eating from the kids menu and even though I didn't try their food, it didn't look appetizing... pale chicken and fries... like I said, I really wanted to like their food, but left disappointed again.  Service is good, and their location is ok since they are hidden in a small shopping mall.  I'll keep trying other restaurants in the area.  Like I said, good people working there, but, their food needs to improve dramatically."}
{"text":"We really loved this Mexican restaurant! I had a soft flour ground beef taco and a side of rice and beans. They were tasty and plentiful. My husband had the barbacoa quesadilla and a carne asada taco. The quesadilla was KILLER!!! Such tender meat and the cheese made it so meaty and delicious. Over all the food was great and the service even better. Our chips and salsa came right away. They give you mild and spicy salsa. Both were really good, but be warned the spicy is really hot! The servers were very attentive with refilling our drinks and once we ordered our food we had it in like 5 minutes. It was all hot and fresh. Also, the prices at this restaurant are awesome! We will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"Glad Ballantyne has good Mexican food finally. Been 3 times and happy overall. Wish they would season their food more though. My chimichanga could have had peppers and onions in it. Their salsa and chips are as amazing."}
{"text":"Food was average in taste we were excited to have a New Mexican restaurant near us but we came out disappointed, we might give it one more try."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is lively and upbeat, the staff is friendly and the food is really good. The house margaritas are taste. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Well we found out it was a chain today but that's still okay. La Unica is one of our go to reasonably priced Mexican restaurants and now that they on Lancaster Highway we're able to go there a lot more often. Good food, nice people, and you still have money in your pocket when you leave."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place because we love the one in Matthews. Not sure if they are related.

When we showed up we thought it was closed because there were no hours or anything on the door and it looked abandoned. We knew it was newly opened so went in anyways. It was nice inside and we were sat right away.

The girl that sat us took our drink order and another guy brought chips and salsa. The chips and salsa were good. If it wasn't for this I would probably give 1 star.

We waited for a long time for someone to take our order and no one ever came. We finally flagged someone down and they were really confused but took our order. I ordered chicken fajitas with no sour cream and my wife got chicken and steak fajitas. While waiting for food no one ever came back to the table so we ran out of drinks and chip snacks. We actually never got a drink refill the entire time we were there.

Finally our food came and it was completely wrong. They gave my wife a burrito and my chicken fajitas had sour cream all over it. We sent back the burrito and I just scraped off the sour cream. We then waited for prob another 15 to 20 min before my wife finally got her food. Again it was wrong because it had shrimp it. Not a huge deal she just ate it anyways.

This whole time no one ever came by the table or refilled drinks. We would see 3 servers bussing a single table that no one was waiting for but no one could check on us. After eating we had to flag down someone again just to get our check and pay.

What I don't understand about this place is how they can have 6 servers working 8 tables but can't refill drinks or chips or get food orders correct. 1 person should be able to manage at least 3 tables alone with ease from my personal experience. This place has HORRIBLE service. The food wasn't bad but when I don't get any water I can't give a decent rating. This location turns over a lot of businesses so if they are to be successful they will need to be better. Maybe we will give it another shot as they were still new."}
{"text":"Good cheap Mexican food in the Ballantyne area.  Same folks who own the one on Central Ave.  Do yourself a favor and try the \"Cheese Steak Burrito Dinner.\"  It's a large tortilla stuffed with fajita steak, grilled onions and cheese.  The whole thing is fried chimichanga style and smothered in queso (served with rice and refried beans)."}
{"text":"Food not good sorry, margaritas good but  price too high, disappointed won't go back too bad"}
{"text":"Mexican food, and what defines good Mexican food is something my wife and I consider ourselves snobs on. She grew up 5 miles from the southern border in California, and I spent a good chunk of my life there. Finding real Mexican food and not Tex-Mex has always been a challenge for us. La Unica definitely serves REAL Mexican food. There are authentic offerings to on the menu, and even more important, authentic taste that hit the table. Their chorizo dip is incredible by the way. Our waiter was quick to greet us and made some good suggestions. They brought out 3 types of salsa including an avocado salsa verde that was really good too. Portions were big, hot and came out at the perfect time. They even had live music!

Awesome experience. We're going back soon."}
{"text":"Found a huge bone in my chicken. They didn't comp my meal or anything after speaking with three workers. Gross. Never going back."}
