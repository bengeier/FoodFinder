{"text":"I ordered a beef brisket soup and there was no meat in the soup. Complete waste of money."}
{"text":"Good place for friends and family!  My favourite is the black pepper short ribs.  Also,  cheap beers also!"}
{"text":"I feel cheated by the 4 star ratings on the page. Even a 1 star rating for this place is too generous. As a native Chinese, I think the food here is so bad and simply not acceptable... The quantity is very small and the taste is horrible. Won't ever come back again."}
{"text":"Malaysian roti for the win! Bay and College  has needed something like this for ages. 

Although admittedly, the beef was too fatty for my liking, the perfectly crisp-on-the-outside roti made me give them four stars.

I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"On a second visit, my dad was very disappointed with the tomato beef brisket noodle soup. He recalled that it was previously a delicious, savory and well-spiced creation. Now is it bland noodle soup. 

Not a repeat."}
{"text":"For some reason they don't seem to get a lot of traffic. We live next doors so just walked in one day to check it out. The happy hour special was great - drink and an appy for less than $10. Came back next week for dinner and order some Thai/Asian fusion food, which was surprisingly delicious. If you're in the area and looking for some quick/cheap comforting Asian food, check this place out. It's no salad king, but it does get a lot of things right."}
{"text":"I always thought Jack Tans was a spiffy bar judging by the name and the non descript store front. Last week we needed a dinner nosh and decided to try it. Upscale it is not. It's kinda a Asian tapas place with lots of appetizers, a menu written on the wall and even a appetizer special. My partner and I had some grilled eggplant and some fried shrimp. Both were decent and came with a happy hour special beer $$$  the app and the beer were $9, so basically the app was free!,"}
{"text":"Finally tested out this eatery and it was pretty enjoyable.  Convenient location south of Bay/College, catchy decor and wide menu with many choices.  Food was tasty and with good portions too.  Only downside was that service was noticeably slow, definitely short-staffed with one waitstaff responsible for all the tables."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of students (10) for a farewell party. It was in mid-August and their AC broke down so we sat near the entrance where they provided a large fan, which balanced out the heat in the room and none of us were sweating while eating. Most of us ordered the happy-hour meal which included a cocktail and appetizer. They came out fairly quickly and the experience was fairly pleasant. I ordered the rice with grilled steak which was delicious although the amount of rice could have been for two people. The ambiance of this restaurant was very nice, great indie music playing in the background but not too loud. I really liked their black-wall that included their menu, promotions and some artwork done by a local artist."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time or 4th time here I think? I brought someone new here this time, one of my co-workers from SickKids hospital. No special occasion, just here for lunch to satisfy our empty stomach. 

I ordered the Hai-nan chicken. Okay before you guys get all \"wtf is that\" on me, let me just first say that I took a picture of my meal this time so you guys can all see how juicy and awesome this chicken was. The reason I got this today was because it was the Friday special and also because I always wanted to try this chicken. The first time i came here I ordered the lemongrass BBQ chicken and it was worth 5 stars to me, 2nd time was beef, 3rd time was chicken, and 4th time is chicken again! Chicken is definitely my favourite here! (So I guess I have been here 4 times). 

The chicken was so moist it couldn't have been anymore moist. The skin was just like it should be. The side of salted green onion and garlic (it's not supposed to be eaten like coleslaw, it's meant to be put on top of the chicken) was perfectly seasoned and awesome. The rice was heaven. I'm like a rice master (since I always eat rice. Don't be racist). It was perfectly cooker, not mushy, not hard, perfectly seasoned (I think they put lemongrass while steaming the rice) and it was just so aromatic and awesome. I probably could've eaten the rice on its own without the chicken and I would've been a happy man. I can't even imagine how bomb that rice would've been if it was put into fried rice. 

One thing you guys should know about this dish before ordering it is that the chicken is supposed to be cold! It's not supposed to be super hot or sizzling. And no, they didn't forget to heat it up or anything. This is the way that Hai-nan chicken should be eaten. Sometimes it's called hainanese chicken.

The ONLY disappointing thing was that I wish there was more chicken because of how good it was. But I guess I can't complain too much because of how cheap it is also! It's only 9 bucks after a 15% discount given at lunch! 

On top of all this, the servers and waiters and waitresses are all very attentive and nice. The owner there is also very nice. Like I said before, I think his name is \"Kai\". 

OKAY LET ME JUST ADD ONE MORE THING... I took pictures of a smaller menu they recently just added. Let me be the first to say that it looks beyond amazing. Most of these dishes are from mainland China and they have everything from spicy fish in a pot, to pig trotters, to pig ears, to braised pork, EVERYTHING OKAY?!? It's definitely a carnivores delight. I took pictures of this too!! 

This place is definitely worth going to whether you're alone or in a group, with family, with your gf or bf, or anyone! Go here! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The portion is so small for this price. There are merely any fish filet in the spicy fish boil. Will not come back again."}
{"text":"Jack Tan's location is a bit presumptuously hidden in the downtown core. Upon seeing a lot of people coming and going from there, I'd figure to step in myself to see what was offered.

It's apparent upon entering, that Jack Tan is set up to be a tapas bar instead of another Chinese restaurant. The place was packed during lunch hours when I arrived, but the staff did not match the capacity of the restaurant. I myself ordered take out to sample some of the dishes on the menu, and to avoid the slow service.

My order consisted of a couple of dishes, which were all Szechuan themed. I ordered the traditional shredded pork with garlic sauce and mapo tofu dish to test the authenticity of this restaurant. Unfortunately the food was not up to par with the price. All of the dishes were overly salty, and the fusion aspect did nothing for me, since it introduced little to no new twist on these classic dishes. 

Safe to say, the experience was less than pleasant, but the restaurant itself is very nicely decorated. If Jack Tan's can control their sodium levels and put more emphasize on the fusion aspects of the food, they'd be very successful in a such a competitive area."}
{"text":"Hmm, not sure why the rating for this place is so low. I'd give it a solid 3.5 stars. But to be perfectly honest, I really only ever get one thing here crispy chow mein with veggies & tofu. I feel like they do this really well actually."}
{"text":"Poor service from a dismissive and inaudible waitress, with appetizers that were probably less than a quarter of a serving per plate at $7 each. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Too salty! The shrimp was bad already! How can they put them in the dish?! I will never come back."}
{"text":"Went there on a weeknight for dinner.  The staff were attentive and fun-they gave us shots of sake on the house!  Food was really unique, my favourites were the tuna nachos and kimchi udon.  If you live in the area you should definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Every now and then, I like to throw weird, random references into my reviews. 

Sometimes, they're actually helpful. 

Today, I mention Schroedinger's Cat; a thought experiment wherein you imagine a cat sealed inside a completely opaque box (or something like that, I'm no scientist-in fact, I've mentioned said cat in a review once before. I just really like the reference). 

The idea is that without opening the box you can't know whether the cat is alive or dead. For all intents and purposes (except its own), the cat can thus be said to exist in two states-living and dead- simultaneously, until the box is opened.

Jack Tan's has windows and doors, and pretty nice ambiance for a random lunch spot at Bay and College. It also does not serve cat. 

It does serve a variety of dishes from across Asia, which is how I get to Schroedinger. Jack Tan's is simultaneously an enjoyable Vietnamese/Thai restaurant, and a horrible chinese restaurant. 

Across a series of lunches, strong items include excellent Vietnamese-style spring rolls with bubbly crispy skins, soothing pho ga and spicy green curry noodle soup teeming with crisp veg and fresh strips of white meat. A won ton soup is more like the stuff my timid friends get when we go for viet; coarsely ground chicken in thin wrappers seasoned with plenty of black pepper. sweet and sour spare riblets have more depth than sugar or pucker, which suits me fine. 

Chinese dishes are uniformly unsuccessful. 

A few times a year I get a hankering for ma po tofu. Jack's lacks pork and the numbing quality that comes with szechuan peppercorns. it's as though he prepared a batch of hot and sour soup, but tilted the ration to load it with bean curd and corn starch. Fried green beans are similarly unbalanced; too many olives makes the dish a sodium bomb. Cantonese-style crispy noodles are food-court grade OK, but not at sit-down prices. 

Service is pleasant and well-informed, although we did feel pushed towards the gwai lo parts of the menu (one dining companion probably didn't help matters by requesting a knife and fork, or larger plates, or tea \"with the meal\", or \"not spicy\", or \"no vegetables\")...

So manybe Jack Tan's is better than this review suggests. i should probably come back by myself."}
