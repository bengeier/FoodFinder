{"text":"So delicious! Came here for my birthday. It is a super quiet place, sometimes it gets too quiet I suggest they play some background music but other then that the food is all very delicious especially the mantu. Everyone here is super polite and nice the girl working there was really cute and amazing! Definitely coming again. :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding Afghan food. Having lived in Kabul I missed good afghani food and decided to take a chance on Aryana.  Mantu was superb,  lamb kebabs were succulent and such a great flavor. Naan was hot and crisp.  Definitively a challenge to find the place,  but worth the effort."}
