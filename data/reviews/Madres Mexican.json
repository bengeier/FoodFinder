{"text":"I stopped by for lunch today and was extremely disappointed. I ordered a taco salad. They had no shredded cheese, no small beverage cups and after I got the order I found out they had no forks! After getting a fork from another vendor I found the meat to be room temp at best. I've been there many times in the past and it was always very good. I wondered if they were closing and trying to get rid of product???"}
{"text":"This was awful! I ate there yesterday and got food poisoning... Can hardly write..... Place was filthy.....i had a feeling when she was putting the meat in the taco that it was bad.... Tasted it and it had a weird taste but ate it anyhow because i was hungry... Wish i didn't.  Their prep station had food all over it... Lady spooning out the burger was spilling it all over as well... Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"I am baffled by the high ratings. I am used to authentic Mexican and even I could cook up a better dish. Very very disappointed! No offers of guacamole or sour cream too!
The price is way too much! And chipotle has much better food for less money!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome employees!  Love their tacos!  Check it out next time you are here.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"When they first opened the food was fantastic. I recently stopped and purchased a burrito that was horrible. I'll give them another try but with much reluctance."}
{"text":"YUM. I would go to Madres over probably any other place in the mall. Everything is so fresh and the staff is very nice.  For Monroeville mall this is the top lol. They have anything Mexican you could want and everything is made in front of you. They have a couple other locations too to try out!"}
{"text":"Closed.  \"Lettuce Eat\" is in its place inside Monroeville Mall as of August, 2016."}
