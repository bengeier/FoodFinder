{"text":"My husband and I came here for a late lunch (after 1pm) on a Wednesday and it was nothing special. The service was poor; she didn't know which beers were on tap and couldn't remember any drink or food specials for the day. The food was just okay for the price; $18 for a tiny portion of mediocre pasta, this is definitely the last time I visit the Met."}
{"text":"The location seems nice. The patio is a comfortable size. The warm Chinook wind blows nearly constantly to keep you comfortable. Staff seems more interested in specific male customers and the wait time for refills or drinks is quite long. Even after we finished eating it was quite a wait for the bill. Prices are a bit high for the flavour and quality of the food. The dishes look great but often feel like there was little thought put into how you actually eat them. The chicken burger was a Costco style chicken breast whole and barely fit in my monster mouth, odd for a more fine dining setting. 

The music was much too loud and we asked to be moved. Even on the edge of the patio it was hard to hear each other or the servers over the loud music. 

I don't recommend this place for anything more then drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst customer service and hospitality I have ever experienced. Now I'm usually not one to complain, I've been in the service industry for 10 years but this was the worst dining experience I have ever had. My friends and I went there for a bachelorette party, the table maintenance was horrible for the 3 hours we were there the server came to the table maybe 3 or 4 times. Our server never quality checked our food or drinks and numerous dishes never came out. When we asked to speak to a manager - 4 times - we were ignored. And to top it off 4 members of our party got food poisoning. When we called to voice our concerns we were put on hold and hung up on. Once we finally got to speak to a manager we were told that we could get sued for claiming we got food poisoning from them. I'm sorry this is not how you respond to a customers concern. Especially when numerous customers were violently ill after dining at your establishment."}
{"text":"In February 2011, the Met debuted a new menu along with a new head chef, and new management overall.

Now, I'm a born-and-raised Calgarian, and I had never been to the Met before.  But it's been around for as long as I can remember, and people kept telling me about how great it was back in the day.

Then it went through a rough patch and there was a time when its reputation took a hit.  Many people complained that it wasn't the same, the service was bad, the food was bad, etc.

Not having a baseline to compare it to, I was able to visit this location with an open mind.

I came for lunch with a bunch of my friends.  We all had different dishes; I had the Chicken Club Sandwich.  It was really good.  It came with the standard chicken, bacon and tomato, but the bacon was candied.  Talking to their new head chef Rusty, he told us that he brushed each bacon slice with Grade A maple syrup.  I went with a friend who knows her maple syrup inside and out, and she said that Grade B is actually what you want to use for food applications like this as Grade A is more suitable for pancakes.  Rusty took the suggestion to heart and expressed a willingness to try new things.

Another friend and myself ordered the Grapecicle, which is a grape-infused ice drink with vodka.  It was really tasty, although hers and my drinks were colored differently each time we ordered one; mine was consistently darker in colour, while hers was lighter (and they weren't even the same shade between batches).  I guess each time they make it, it's different depending on the amount of syrup they use, but we couldn't help but chuckle that the guy got the bluer drink while the gal got the redder drink.  They made for pretty pictures though.

Dessert was the chocolate molten lava cake, which was a chocolate brownie cake with a gooey chocolate centre.  It was really good, but our order took a long time to arrive as one of the cakes broke in the mold and they had to make another.  Unfortunately, they never told us that and many people chose to leave before dessert arrived as they had to get back to work.  The chef personally apologized for the delay.

So what do I think of the new Met?

The food is excellent.  Everyone had nothing but good things to say about the items they tried.

The service is inconsistent though, but they are trying to do better.  The staff seem to be reinvigorated with all the recent changes, and I could tell that the new head chef is working hard to please.  The waitress was always near by to service us, and despite the mix up during dessert, the service was always prompt.

Would I go back?  Definitely yes, if only to try another bacon dish.  Will those who have had bad experiences in the past come back?  Hard to say, but with the recent managerial changes throughout their entire operations, I would urge people to give them another shot, especially if they're the type of people who had a good experience years ago and were lamenting on how recently things just weren't \"the same.\"  And I look forward to reading more reviews of people in that situation, to see whether or not the new Met can regain the reputation it seemed to have when I was growing up."}
{"text":"We went for a bachelorette party and I was VERY disappointed.

We had a private dinner room, and were there for 2.5 hours. In that 2.5 hours the bride-to-be got one drink. That is how slow it was.

The food, some came out after a bit, some came out 20 minutes later - annoying

My second drink of the night, the server drops it off and asks what I would like to order, as I was turning and moving my menu to ask about something, I accidently knocked it over, spilling the whole thing. Note, I had only had 1 drink, this was just a silly accident, not a drunk one. Well, the server, who was standing next to me, watched it happen, made no offer to clean it up or replace it. I had to ask 3 times to get a wet cloth to wipe down the sticky table, and based on her frequency, this took 30 minutes. The food wasn't very good and overpriced, the ahi tuna tacos had barely any tuna. 

But seriously, when anyone spills their drink at a decent restaurant they replace it. Way to get customers to return, knowing you're that cheap.

Everyone at the table who ordered drinks didn't actually get them until they asked twice, or even 3 times. I think I put in about 5 orders in total and got and paid for 3, 1 of which was spilled. 

I will NOT return."}
{"text":"Went as part of a group of four. Here's where we all stood
Appetizer of calamari and dynamite roll: 5/5 very tasty

Entrees orders
Filet mignon - enjoyed it but the mashed potatoes were a little too watery
Rockfish - enjoyed it but the fries were too much and too oily
Roast chicken - enjoyed it but portion too big
Lobster with Mac and cheese: enjoyed but too cheesy. 

Dessert: nice but a little disappointing

Service: very friendly and fast but not fast enough for lunch hour.  

All in all, the dessert comment sums it up. This was a nice joint but also a little disappointing. Nobody cleared their plate but we all still thought the food was tasty. We all left thinking we'd definitely return but wouldn't order the same dishes"}
{"text":"I went in for dinner around 6pm to watch game 5 of the stanley cup final.  The restaurant was empty so I figured the service would be good.  It took over 20 minutes and asking the waitress 4 times to put the game on.  She seemed more interested in chatting with the staff than serving customers.  

She disappeared for a while and eventually came back and asked \"What do you want?\"  She dissapeared and another waitress brought us our food who was way more attentive and actually seemed to care about her job.

The food was alright but nothing special.  If I wanted to feel unwanted I could go visit family instead of paying stuck up waitresses.  

It wasn't the worst restaurant I have been to in Calgary but it was far from being the best."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Hotel Le Germain with my girlfriend for a romantic little get away and I forgot to make reservations at Charcut (Charcut is at the base of the hotel). So instead we went walking down Stephen Ave. to see what we could find. After a short time we decided on The Metropolitan Grill. Service was ok.. nothing over the top. We started with the Angus Reserve Sliders. Couldn't complain about anything with this appetizer. For the mains my girlfriend ordered a Sirloin Steak with potatoes and seasonal veg. She also asked the server if she could substitute the Veg for a salad and they were kind enough to accommodate her in that way. However, she asked for her steak medium and it came out more on the rarer side. She ate most of it and I ate everything that was a bit too red for her liking. I prefer my steaks medium rare so I was fine with it. As for my main, I had the Creole Rockfish with seasonal Veg and rice. The seasoning and sauces were very tasty, but where it fell short was the cooking. Some of the edges and a portion of the bottom side of the fish were charred very badly which spoiled a few of my first bites. Check out my pics and you'll see the charred edges, but not the underside. Even though the rest of the fish was ok I know I should have said something, but I didn't which I can only blame myself for lol. What pisses me off now is that I'm wondering if the chef knew that the fish was questionable, but sent it out anyways taking the chance that it might be sent back!? Overall, this experience was poor especially for the very high prices we had to pay for mediocre food. My lesson here: Make sure to make reservations at the restaurant I actually want to go to!!! Haha"}
{"text":"Our server was not attentive at all. After asking for water I had to wait over 10mins twice. She brought me a dirty glass with white floaties, when I kindly asked for a new water she gave a stink eye and grabbed the glass from my hands. I asked her to add mushrooms into my pasta instead of chicken and she brought me a bowl of whole cooked mushrooms....3 people ordered the same dish, yet all three had a different appearance and taste...the consistency of the food is not great. Although the braised lamb was good, the rest of the group left hungry and dissatisfied with service"}
{"text":"Metro grill is a very happening place but I feel a little like an outsider. (maybe I just don't get out enough)

We had the \"private\" room booked for a friends big 3oh and it was awesome! We kinda  felt important sitting in a secluded area away from the crowd but, at the same time we were missing good people watching and all the action as the night wore on.

The food was top notch, though (kinda like you would find on the Iron Chef show) the portions are more like what you would get for an appetizer and not what I'd call entire size.
Even though, it was tasty, its not what I'd consider a big menu selection. Maybe because Metro grill is more of a night club than a restaurant .The menu had lunch, brunch, appys, dinner and desserts all  at one quick glance.

The line up outside grew(20-30 people) as the night wore on and I noticed a change in the behavior of the door men. Way to much testosterone and machismo. Come on guys, 6 of us just went for a smoke, you saw us leave( for the forth time)  then you give us attitude when we go back inside??Like we were line jumpers?

Over all it looks like a great place to go for a night out dancing and hanging with the bar crowd but unless your \"that  crowd\" its just not for me and certainly is not \"my crowd\".
I might try it again for the good food, except next time we'll go for brunch."}
{"text":"I suppose in some ways my 'dislike' might be in trying to lump The Met on Stephen Ave. into the 'pub' category... which really isn't fair (but then neither is life...).  The Met (and again, I'm talking about The Met on Stephen Ave downtown not the skanky cougar Met on 17th...) is a lively lounge restaurant on Stephen Ave right across from Banker's Hall and Earls.  The Met tries to be upscale and cosmo; expect to see (and see a lot of) service staff in skimpy little dresses and lecherous suit and tie guys.

On the good side, The Met does have a fantastic summer patio space that's always in heavy use in good weather and I think they manage to get the vibe they're looking for in the lounge.  

In many respects I'd put The Met in the same space as Belgo down the street from it and while I'm not really a fan of either, I think The Met achieves it's goal better than Belgo does.

On the bad side, it just feels icky to me... pretentious, self inflated (and not just with silicone), and shallow.  I suppose they have food there but really, people go primarily for drinks.  It's heaving many afternoons and on Fridays gets so packed you need to be coated in a lubricant to get in.  The only time I go is when I'm with someone who really wants to go and I can't convince them to go somewhere else.  All of my personal bias to one side, I think management at least understands the space they're trying to fill and they seem to have a winning product."}
{"text":"Expensive food for not much return on the tastebud meter. This is a place to be seen, mostly... and to hang out with people who like to dress up and spend a lot of money on drab, tasteless Big Box restaurant-style food. Think macaroni and cheese for grownups... but with a huge price tag to boot."}
{"text":"Friends and I went to the Met when it first opened after the reno's. We had a fantastic waitress (Tawny or Tori?) Problem? Why yes. The BAR MANAGER (Colin) would not make her drinks. We asked about when we can expect our drinks a couple of times. We waited 15 minutes for a couple of bottles of wine. The waitress was stoic and positive, apologized for the delay. We noticed she was arguing with the bar manager. She came back to let us know it will be at our table shortly. We mentioned what we saw and she started crying!! He was NOT making her drinks on purpose. He argued with her in front of the customers. He tore up her tickets she rang in and threw them away!! We watched a couple of tables get up and leave due to his unprofessional behavior.

How in anyone's view is this adding value to the business?! Not only did he interfere with profit and repeat business, he interfered with the waitresses livelihood!! How does someone like that add value to any business!! The assistant manager talked to our table stating the first round of drinks are on the house. Not sure how profitable this practice is but maybe if the Bar Manager behaved professionally....

I gave the waitress a $30.00 tip.

Sadly we gave this a second chance last Thursday. The two of us sat at the bar to wait for a third person in our party. It was about 3:30ish. The girl behind the bar was AWESOME! Unfortunately she left at shift change. We met Nick? Brown hair down to his shoulders. Not one time was our wine continually poured as any high end establishment should do, We never were offered of a second bottle. THE KICKER -- our friend showed up, asked information about a red wine she was going to purchase. HIS RESPONSE - \"I DON'T KNOW AND I'M TOO BUSY!! That was it! We didn't tip and the restaurant manager with spikey hair harangued my friend on our way out. 

Good luck and good riddance."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check out The Met again since they re-opened after their renovations. Since it's in a prime location, I wasn't surprised that I couldn't book right at lunch - which was fine I didn't mind eating at a later time.

Even when we arrived it was still quite busy from the lunch rush, but we were seated right away. I really like how open the dining area is since they reno-ed, the private dining rooms are now partitioned with glass walls so it's not so dark during the daytime.

I was torn between getting my usual staple (Lobster Mac & Cheese YUM!) and the Scallop Gnocci, and our server gave us her input and even suggested some appies for us to try - which I appreciate. I like when the staff are knowledgeable of the food they serve.

Overall good experience, I would suggest if you go here to dine before or after nigh noon to avoid the rush"}
{"text":"Well it's just not the same anymore.
Still good staff, but food didn't quite cut it, chicken dish was creamy, looked good but lacked flavour. 
Unfortunately both myself and my buddy had the same, so can't comment on anything else.
I'm sure some of the of dishes are better.

It does have one of the best 8th Ave patios still."}
{"text":"Honestly, I kind of went into the Metro Grill not expecting too much. Probably because I've never heard of anybody having a mind-blowing experience at one and I only ever hear complaints. However, on a quest to try a few more elevated patios, this was pretty close to my apartment so I figured, why not? Impressed, I was.

The food was above average, we had the fish tacos and the number 42, which was a Asian lemon chicken dish.  Upon questioning why the dish has such a strange name, the waitress actually asked the chef. Apparently, the lemon chicken is no. 42 on the menu of a majority of Chinese restaurants. This of course isn't true, but the fact that the waitress actually asked the chef for us was a testament to good service. 

Furthermore, the fact that the staff managed to get the patio ready just hours after a major rainstorm passed through the city shows how hard they work. That impressed me as well.

The Guinness was fine and the view from the patio onto 17th (thought you may have to maneuver around some potted plants) was nice.  

All in all, a good experience at the Metropolitan Grill."}
{"text":"The Metropolitan Grill certainly seemed to be a happening place. It was packed and everyone seemed to be having a good time. The atmosphere was lively in the lounge area and it felt like the place to be. I had the crispy salmon entree and it wasn't bad. I certainly have had better salmon as this a little dry, but the bed of mashed potatoes it was served on were very good. Overall the serving size was small and the service was just ok. It wasn't bad but I wasn't wow'd either. 

It was an ok experience but I am not sure if it would be high on my return list."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were walking down the street and noticed this place and decided to Check it out:
Really really slow service
I had the chipotle chicken tacos - these were so dry I could barely eat them ( I told the waitress which only came to our table a couple times and she told the kitchen)
Boyfriend got lobster Mac and cheese- this was good but for the price 26$ should have more lobster
Drinks were ok not that great for the price 10$. We had empty drinks a lot of the time and we were done our appetizers ( coconut shrimp and dynamite rolls, which were good) are food took FOREVER
The waitress was so brutal. I was getting annoyed and I just got up so we could get our bill

They did end up giving us a free dessert on the house (fudge brownie) it was really really dry and to much raspberry sauce on the bottom. 

Sorry won't ever go there again. Seems like we are not the only ones that think that!!!"}
{"text":"I headed to Met Grille with 2 customers per their suggestion.  I haven't been to the Met in a while so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was happily surprised by how great it was.  

I ordered the Delmonico salad which was a great melding of medium rare steak (you can order it how you like), blue cheese and pork belly served on crisp salad greens.  One of the best salads I've ever had.

My lunch companions had the steak sandwich and the bbq burger (I think).  They were both happy with their meal as well.

The only negative was the group of workers that seemed to be speccing out the place for renos.  They were milling about measuring things, etc.  It really seemed like they could have done that when the restaurant wasn't serving customers."}
{"text":"Came on a Drambuie promotion night- 2 free drinks per person- not bad....definitely will agree that this is a place geared more towards the 30 something crowd and is quite the \"meat market\" others say it is.  Funny to people watch the people watchers....
Arrived to two lines-what I call the unknowns and the other for the \"pretty people/sweet talkers\"......if u know what I mean....
Got in with some sweet talkin' and did enjoy the music.  Dance floor was quite small, but that's okay.  Settled to dance by an open window and that helped with the ventilation.

Not bad for my 1st night out in Calgary...."}
{"text":"I really enjoy a place that's doing their own thing and doing it well. In a sea of repetitive chains I found the originality of the Metropolitan Grill refreshing. I was staying at the Hyatt Regency and went to the Met on a whim. As a solo diner on business (well if you call telling jokes at the Jubilee Auditorium that) this was a really welcoming place, with a great atmosphere. I went for the Korean BBQ lettuce wraps and I chose well - delicious! For the main I was confident in the Indian food as their tackling of Korean was so darn spot on. The Butter Chicken was lip-smackin' ace. I've eaten in thirty-five countries from yakitori in Tokyo back alleys to beef Wellington at Gordon Ramsay's in London. Each city has a few gems that I remember fondly and this is definitely one of Calgary's. Thanks for the fantastic food and the nice time, see you on the next trip."}
{"text":"Same vibe has Cactus Club (which is next door) or Joey's.

We had a reservation Saturday (04/07);  we arrived in two groups, so when the first half of the party arrived, we were introduced to our server and ordered some beverages. It took awhile for the beverages to arrive, which was strange because the place only had three other tables at 7pm.

Once the second half of the party arrived, it took awhile for someone to come by. At one point, we were actually being served by 4 different people, then we're told: \"your server is too busy with the other table, so you'll be getting another server soon\". The first hour of our experience wasn't great.

The server we ended up with was fine. Very knowledgeable on the menu, which was a refreshing change.

Food was great and the fozen - amazing! But next time I am visiting, I'd rather go to Cactus.

Oh and one of the girls were charged $40 for her steak sandwich, thank god she noticed. I wonder how many people haven't.."}
{"text":"I read the reviews before making dinner reservations for six.  I thought people were being a little hard on their comments. They were not.  Service was a zero.  Trying to get 6 glasses of water was like trying to find water in the Sahara desert!  Appetizers are extremely overpriced for what you receive.  The Mac & Cheese Ballers came with just 3 balls for $14.25.  Really!?  The restaurant could have added at least one more to make it an even number.  One member in our party ordered Quiona Salad with the optional striploin.  She received a steak sandwich.  That was sent back to the kitchen and then she received the salad with the striploin, - but no squash, goat cheese, tomatoes, cranberries, etc.  Just the lettuce and striploin.  She decided not to complain any more.  Would we revisit this restaurant?  No thank you."}
{"text":"Last weekend was a girlfriend's bachelorette party and she chose to host it at The Met. At first, I was a little put off because The Met. in Calgary is known as a bit of a cougar bar. I'm not a cougar...not yet anyways, so I wasn't sure I was gonna fit in. 

We got there around 8pm and it was DEAD. Seriously, it was like everyone had chosen to go everywhere BUT the Met. I was secretly hoping that we would start bar hopping, but it didn't look like my prayers were going to be answered anytime soon. In a weird way, I'm actually GLAD we ended up staying there. 

When midnight hit, the bar was PACKED. I don't know what happened, but it got to the point where we could barely move! The dance floor is teeny weeny, but they were playing good music, so it took a lot to keep us off the dance floor. 

There was an interesting mix of people there that night. There was your standard bachelorette party crowd (we weren't the only ones), there was your standard bar hopping crowd, there was the older crowd, and there was the 'really nice and didn't have anywhere else to go' crowd. 

A couple of the people that we met there that night were some of the nicest people I've ever met at a bar. I was pleasantly surprised. 

Last call was around 2, and all in all, it was a fun night. 

I don't know if I'd recommend the place as the 'go to' place of the evening, but being new in town, it was a cool place to chill on a Friday night when the alternative would've been staying home in my PJs and watching rentals."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience here in 2014. Food took over an hour after we had ordered, server barely visited our table, and the food was sub par. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Summer patio livin'!  Metropolitan has it all,  great food,  great service,  awesome patio! 

Right on Stephen Av.  The Met is centrally located with a large patio with tons of seating. 

During summer it's usually a busy spot,  get here early,  stay late. The view is worth taking in!"}
{"text":"Service is OK and the food was average. 2 beers 2 main courses $71 without a tip. Pricy for an average bar hence average reviews. There are dozens similar places of that kind and this one doesn't stand out at all. Would I come again? Probably not."}
{"text":"First time in downtown Calgary and a business acquaintance took me to lunch at the Met Grill. I had a lunch special, a lamb wrap with salad. It was great and tasty. The place was mostly full of business attire having lunch, and skimpy dressed waitresses.."}
{"text":"I haven't gone to this place in years and I remember why. 
We were trying to find a place to go for lunch, around 11:30 and chose here. It was exceptionally busy and if you know you're a busy lunch place you should have enough staff to accommodate.

From start until finish was almost 2 hours, that is unacceptable for a downtown place. We got there around 11:30, we didn't even see our server until close to noon. 

I had the candied salmon salad, which was ok, lots o dressing so it was soggy. And for $20, that's a little steep."}
{"text":"Service was terribly slow, the food wasn't fresh and really overpriced.  The patio was empty when we arrived and we quickly learned why.  The weather was great, so we appreciated the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I always enjoy myself at The Met.  When it gets too crazy and the meat market gets to be too much, you can always go somewhere else.  The Met is a good place for happy hour drinks."}
{"text":"Drinks and service were excellent. Atmosphere was lively and metropolitan. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"A good place to go for lunch with co-workers or a bevie or two on the patio in the summer.

The Mount Royal location is....well, everyone should experience it for themselves. When I have girlfriends visiting from out of town, I like to take them here so they can pick up. They usually leave pretty happy."}
{"text":"Super impressed with the entire team at The Met. Our company (Argo Sales) along with several others held our annual Powder Patch event their this last week. The food was fantastic, and kept 350 people fed the entire time. The staff and Managment deserve a huge high 5! It was a challenging evening at some points with the amount of guests being in attendance. I would recommend hosting your company party here! Well done!"}
{"text":"Only go for drinks, and never for food.

First off, the Met is expensive. If you're willing to move past that, you can get some decent drinks here in a more quiet atmosphere. I only really go here because I know I can get a table and generally decent service. Sometimes Stephen Ave is just too busy for anywhere else.

Happy hour favorite mostly because it's no one else's favorite."}
{"text":"Yikes, I do not know what I was thinking calling this place to ask a question. The event planner was so rude and dismissive. She hung up the phone before I was even done talking. I thought people in Canada are suppose to be nice? Definitely will never send my business or my clients to this venue."}
{"text":"The food is tasty... But it was so loud that I was not able to enjoy dinner and I wasn't the only one who felt this way. Even though the food was good, I would not suffer through that again and based on that, I give this place 2 stars."}
{"text":"Went Sat Mar 3rd for lunch - wasn't busy, but got a crummy table anyway.

Almost $8 for a pint of beer.  Italian panini was not very good.  Bread had too much seasoning, and the meats were nothing special.

Good location on Stephen Ave."}
{"text":"My biggest exposure to the Met has been walking by the patio in the summer while bar hopping. I would sometimes suggest it as a place to go, but my friends would glance over and look at the plastic girls and the disturbingly metrosexual guys and it would get vetoed. Always vetoed. I'm also a bit young for the night time meat market...  The Met after work and the Met at night are two very different animals.

I've been in a few times for work functions and nice dinners. I really love their cocktails - yummy and girly and well presented. Very sex and the city. The food was pretty tasty, though expensive, but not quite to my tastes. All a little too standard, although excellently executed. I loved the decor. And the bathrooms. Beautiful. Bathroom heaven, my friends."}
{"text":"Not bad but steak was a little fatty but over all it was acceptable.  Had a lunch date and food didnt stand out at all."}
{"text":"I stopped in at the Metropolitan Grill on impulse with a co-worker while in Calgary for business.  Neither of us was familiar with downtown dining and we needed a place to grab a quick late lunch before heading home.  The restaurant was deserted at 3 pm (which isn't surprising), but our service was quite a bit slower than I expected.  I think I was initially put off by our waitress because my dining partner was in the middle of speaking when she came over, and her annoyance that he finished his thought instead of stopping immediately to address her was apparent.  

The atmosphere is very modern, with low lighting and small tables.  The menu had a lot of variety on it, with steep prices for all the items.  I got a chicken burger, and while it was good, it was nothing special.  It certainly wasn't worth $17.  We waited quite a while for our food to arrive, and I was finished more than half my burger before the waitress came to check on us after we got our food.  Bottom line: food was overpriced, and service was neither quick nor friendly."}
{"text":"I had heard this place has \"attractive girls, but the food is mediocre\".
My personal experience at a lunch hour, confirmed it !"}
{"text":"So came here and ordered the Korean Beef bowl. I heard lots of good things about it. I asked the server if its spicy and she said its super mild. I ordered and I found it very spicy (not mild) and it had too much sauce in it. To the point it wasn't edible. Well we told the server and instead we got something else. We got it exchanged. I got a Chedder bacon burger. The burger was very salty. It came with soup and so I got the mushroom soup. That was very good. 

The décor or atmosphere makes you feel like you are at a trendy restaurant. I like it. It was definitely fun and enjoyable to sit and eat at this restaurant. Food wise is not good. I do like the service here. For that reason I gave it a 3. Technically the place just based on food would be a 2.

I might come back if friends insisted."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets 3 stars is because the food is really good. We saw the sign for $1 oysters earlier (a Thursday special!) and decided to stop in for dinner! The oysters, baked Brie and grilled cheese were great! Our waitress on the other hand was not. We ordered pretty much when we got in (8:15pm) and the appetizer (baked Brie) came out about 8:30ish. We had ordered drinks (nothing fancy just water and iced tea).... however those didn't show up until about when we were almost done with the appetizer. The food then came out and we were planning to order some more food off the happy hour menu (which starts at 9pm) so it was perfect. But.... our waitress didn't come by. Our drinks sat empty, table full of plates... and it was about 20-30 minutes AFTER we were done eating she came by.... which was after we had signaled to the manager (it looked like) that we wanted the check. Needless to say, because the service was so horrible, we didn't order any more..,, because we didn't want to be there until midnight waiting for food! Our waitress finally hustled over with the check and when she learned we were from Vegas was so excited to talk to us. Day late, dollar short. Needless to say, if you want good food and have time... go here. Our waitress would not last working in Vegas since her service was sub par."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I have received in a long time. Took 20 minutes just for drinks to arrive, another 30 for appetizers with no side plates. We were never once checked on or offered another round of drinks.  Finally just got the bill and for the first time ever I never tipped. The Met should have stayed closed in my opinion."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place, known as \"The Met\" to regulars when walking from dinner back to the Fairmont. It was probably the most lively place in this area so we popped in for a drink. Sat at a high top and there was great music playing. Saturday they had a special on frozen bellinis so I had one of those and a glass of champagne. My fiancé had a beer. It's a fun place to \"people watch\" and the atmosphere is great. Would definitely return for drinks after dinner or ever for dinner. They have a large patio and hope to grab a drink there when the weather gets better!"}
{"text":"Good tacos... And good drinks... The patio is very cool and the location is very convenient for some drinks after work.. The ambience is very nice .."}
{"text":"One star for ambiance but I would not ever go back to this place, none of the food is fresh here. Even the lime wedges on the drinks were brown and old! The calamari tasted like it was taken out of a bag from the freezer and then microwaved...super limp and chewy and they looked (and had the texture of) gummy worms! not light and crispy like calamari should be. Both the mushroom and ahi tacos were also disgusting...the mushroom ones were cold and flavorless and the ahi on the tacos was GREY....and i spit out a piece of white chewy fat that was in one! So bad. The shrimp appetizer was decent, but also tasted like frozen food you could heat up in an oven at home. UGH. So disappointed."}
{"text":"My hubby & I recently went here for the first time in a couple of years. We have nothing against it, it's just that typically we're not 'high-end' people. Last time, we found the waitress was a tad stuck up and not all too polite, but we see they hired new people since then. Now the hostess & waitresses are all very accomodating and friendly. Rob got the burger & fries (which are quite good. Shoe string-style with pepper). I got something called the #42, which was an Asian-inspired lemon chicken dish. It was actually quite good, I felt like I was eating like a pig lol. If you have a $20+ per person budget, and want to indulge and enjoy a trendy, upscale dining experience, I recommend this place located just along Stephen Ave downtown :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate at here on Wed, Nov 26 @ 12 noon.  I made the reservation via Yelp SeatMe!  When we got there separately, we were promptly told that we had to be there by 11:45 a.m. for a 12 noon reservation!  What is up with that?!?  If I made reservation for 12 noon, I expect to have a table for 12 noon!  The lady (very short with long, dark hair) manning the door facing Stephen Avenue was very rude when I got there 5 mins to 12 noon and promptly told me that my friend was already in the restaurant, seated somewhere behind the back lounge.  She wouldn't tell me where my table was exactly and she scolded me saying I had to be at the restaurant by 11:45 a.m.  I was appalled!!  She did not even lead me to my table but left me roaming among the busy tables to find my own table!!  Luckily, a male waiter stopped to assist me.  He was at least nice! The email reservation does not state anything like that.  I have never met such a rude and unprofessional maître'd before in all of the restaurants I've eaten in downtown Calgary.  

Let it be known I won't be stepping back in your restaurant any time soon.

Environment - Way too noisy.  It's more of a bar than a restaurant!

Wait service sucks too.

Food sucks as well.

Metropolitan Grill, you need to shape up!"}
