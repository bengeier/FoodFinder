{"text":"I enjoyed my lunch here and would recommend it if:
- you are looking for Italian-Canadian food, not strictly authentic Italian food
- you are in the mood for pasta, not pizza (can't speak for the brunch or desserts as I didn't try them, sigh!)
- you want reasonably priced Italian-Canadian food (bonus points here!)
- you want a casual environment, not particularly remarkable for its interior design but clean and cozy

I recommend the pasta dishes because there is a decent selection, with a variety of sauces and toppings. I enjoyed my agnolotti stuffed with goat cheese and leeks, and was happy that I was able to change the sauce: I asked for tomato sauce instead of grilled portobello mushroom pesto cream sauce, which sounds interesting but strays too far from my notion of pesto sauce (I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to these things).  
My friend had a pizza and while it had a nice crust (quite thin but moist), it had too much cheese and not enough sauce for my liking.

Overall rating: 3/5 for the pastas, reasonable prices, good service and cozy environment."}
{"text":"A fantastic new restaurant to discover, especially as we're heading into the holiday season. Great pasta, seafood and a creative use of sluce bish to really spice up the dishes and make you can't wait for the werewolf when you're starving and craving those sumptuous, creative dishes.
Oh yes, I adore it!!!"}
{"text":"I've been for dinner twice, since it opened.  I've had a great experience both times, with good service, reasonable prices, and delicious food.  On opening night, the owner came to our table and as we spoke, mentioned that many of the staff had come from Serra.  However, I find this place more affordable, although there is now a war of the prix fixe between the two.
  I like Lakvino's open dining room (roll-up door on nice days) and friendly atmosphere.   The food was nicely presented, and the portion on my pasta dish was insane!  The pizza was good, as well.  In a land riddled with sushi and fro-yo, this was a welcome addition to the neighbourhood.  I miss Zizi's Trattoria that used to be across the street, though!  But, until Zizi's returns from their Woodbridge exile back to the land of tourist sushi, I'll keep going to Lakvino's."}
{"text":"Walking along the Annex strip of Bloor, I am often frustrated to find myself confronted by an excess of crusty little restos but nothing (I want) to eat. And so I was delighted to find Lakvino, a new and much-needed Italian addition to this neighbourhood.

My friend and I had the pappardelle and the gnocchi with ros√© sauce, respectively. The gnocchi was very good, but the pappardelle was amazing. With respectable slices of smoked duck, mushrooms, and truffle oil, I only managed to steal a couple delicious bites before my friend cut me off. Considering that most dishes are under $15, I was very impressed. They are also very vegetarian friendly (with comparable or more veg options than By the Way), and have $4 martini specials on Thursdays.

The ambiance is romantic, with fresh roses at every table and slightly dimmed lighting. The front window opens in the summer, so if you can grab a table nearby it's especially lovely on a summer evening. The server was friendly, albeit a bit persistent, but he managed to make $14 entrees feel like a classy restaurant experience (complete with bread basket and errthing), so props for that. And, as Michael A. noted, bonus points must be awarded for providing something the Annex on Bloor has thus far been lacking.

Food vs price: 4.5/5
Service & ambiance: 4.5/5

Overall, I will be back when I want reasonably priced Italian (or non-Asian) food in the Annex. This would also be an excellent place for a romantic date that is surprisingly inexpensive."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations in every way.  Went there because it's close to my hotel, though some of the Yelp comments did give me pause.  

I can't find anything bad to say.  The service and food were truly exceptional -- by far the best meal we had during our four day trip to Canada.  As good or better than my favorite local Italian restaurants, and I'll definitely go back next time I'm in Toronto.

Prices were reasonable for the quality, and I especially liked the \"open air\" feeling from the wall-less side of the restaurant facing the street.

Our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.  She even gave us a cheery hello the next morning when we passed her while we were going out to breakfast."}
{"text":"I was very satisfied with my experience here. My server was a very nice man that catered to my needs. 

The complimentary bread was alright, but the dip that accompanied it was so delicious. It was a roasted red pepper and bean dip. I had the prix-fix dinner special. To start, I had the Caesar salsad, which was alright. For the main course, I had the fettucine with gorgonzola sauce and bacon. It was very rich, creamy, and filling and I enjoyed it. For dessert, I had the creme brulee, but I didn't much care for it.

I enjoyed the pasta and the service was great."}
{"text":"I have to say that the service we had here was good (plenty of water, bread, etc.), and our server was nice enough to comp our 1/2 litre of wine (just to be nice, there weren't any problems), but I can't recommend this place based on their food.

I had the organic greens salad, which was fine - nothing special. My companion had the caesar, which looked good. My main was a big disappointment though - I'd ordered the margherita pizza. Unfortunately what I got was more like the cheese pizza at Pizza Pizza, but with a thinner crust. No basil and covered in Kraft-like mozzarella. It was really more the kind of thing you want to have at 2am, not for dinner.

That said, the pasta dish (fettucine with duck) that my companion had was good - so maybe you're fine if you stick with the pasta dishes.

We also had the creme brulee for dessert - it was OK but not great."}
{"text":"Ate here months ago for brunch, and enjoyed it enough to remember and return for dinner. 

Came here late Friday afternoon (for an early dinner), and enjoyed a relatively empty restaurant. 

The food was decent. My dining partner is Italian, so clearly all Italian is subject to the \"nonna\" standard, but this fared decently. 

I had the gnocchi in rose sauce, and he had the chicken rigatoni. Both were fairly well done, although my \"rose\" sauce was not like any rose sauce I've ever had. 

The only downside to the meal were: 

our server (while very sweet) hardly spoke english, and her description of the specials was almost undecipherable. 

my rose gnocchi was so rich that I BARELY made it through half, and the rest was not offered to be wrapped up. 

All in all, will likely go here again, but am in no rush."}
