{"text":"Although the restaurant looks unremarkable from the outside, the food is fantastic and service attentive. Shared the agedashi tofu and grilled squid appetisers, spider roll , and a Tokujyo Zushi.  Appetizers were cooked to perfection.  The spider roll was made with a very generous portion of tasty soft shell crab - certainly one of the best I've had.  Sushi was very fresh and really did seem to melt in your mouth.  Although my husband and I were stuffed, we curiously eyed the Mandarin Pie on the menu and shared that as well.  Surprisingly light and a good end to a very satisfying meal.    Next time I will order the omakase.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Zen, my biggest fear has come true. I have been a regular at Zen Scarborough for over ten years.  I tried the new Markham location recently. The restaurant appears to be very nice when you arrive however inside the atmosphere feels very cold and sterile. It is not quaint or inviting and does not make you want to talk to your neighbors like the old place did. The service is extremely slow and there is nothing to look at while you're waiting. At the old location you could look at the fish display cases and ponder what you would order next or discuss with other people at the counter things they have tried.  I ordered Omakase set one. This $85 dinner includes one appetizer, sushi dinner and a dessert. We arrived at 6:30 and left the restaurant at 10:15! The service was extremely slow there was some times as long as a 15 minute wait in between pieces of sushi.  My overall feeling of the new Zen is that it is now extremely expensive for the service and for what you get. I was very disappointed with the appetizer and the desert. I was under the impression they had a professional Japanese chef in the kitchen but did not see his talents come through that night. The lack of alcohol possibly had something to do with the long wait as well, green tea just wasn't cutting it. I may try it again but not in the near future."}
{"text":"I went on Yelp and searched for Sushi based on my location; filtered the results to highest rating, and Zen Japanese Restaurant was on top of the list. I was skeptical, so I decided to try it out. I reserved a sushi date for two.   The area was about sketchy because one side was close to a strip club, and the other side was close to a convenience store. Don't let the vicinity fool you. From the inside, it feels like you're homely and relaxing.   The food was great and fresh. You can really taste the difference. I guess a few dollars more to spend, and you'll get more of quailty than quantity. Even though, the food they served was fresh, I still found that it was a bit too expensive. A few orders can run you close to $50 (see photos --- to follow).   Overall, since travel time wasn't a factor and it was just a walking distance, I recommend this place. The time spent on gas can offset the quality for the price of the food they serve."}
{"text":"Value for money. Omakase set is authentically arranged with surprise on last hand roll dish. Oven-heated seaweed is crispy and makes a good blend with minced tuna."}
{"text":"I love me some sushi and salmon teriyaki... And zen hits the spot. I went here with the hubby yesterday. Pretty small place but let me tell u, the salmon teriyaki was perfectly cooked. It was no frozen bland crap like in certain Japanese places. Fresh fresh fresh =) my only complaint is that the maki rolls weren't tightly wrapped, and being pretty big, it fell apart whenever we tried to tried to dip it in our soya sauce. Don't get me wrong though. It was DELISH! And the ladies working there are very sweet. Wish they weren't that expensive. O well, I'll make sure I'll go there every month. Looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Ordered their sushi omakase menu which include 13 pieces of assorted sushi and a salmon handroll. Fish was really fresh probably one of the best I have had in a long time! For dessert we ordered Mandarin pie, I liked it too, kind of refreshing.  My friend I ordered an order of futomaki on the side. The futomaki was probably the biggest futomaki roll I have ever seen! I will definitely go back to this restaurant.   Call early to make reservations. We were seated by the door and saw them turn down at least 6 groups of people with no reservations. I will probably go again before they move to Markham in May 2015!"}
{"text":"TL;DR - Food was decent (as expected) but service took a long time; and portions are small. No one explains what fish you're getting either so how do you know what the \"Chef Selection\" is?  For a better omakase experience, try Yasu.  ---  I hate to be writing this review since I really did want to like Zen, but in the end, I think my expectations were just too high and they couldn't deliver.  For the price and a more \"occasional\" visit type of restaurant, I think Zen would benefit from having better service to get that extra repeat customer back.  However, the truth is, I wouldn't frequently visit Zen anyway and now, I'm even less enticed to go back.  The restaurant is located in a strip of commercial shops with parking and no other restaurants around except those in neighbouring strips. It's beside the Mandarin and Timmy's.  Plenty of parking and might be hard to spot so be warned if you don't live in the area.    I went on a Friday night with a large party - group of 8.  My group arrived earlier than me and got seated right away (by the door).  The restaurant itself (too bad I didn't take photos) is actually larger than I thought.  It easily fits about 30 people (with the bar) and I think there are rooms inside as well but I didn't go take a look.  The menu has 3 options - there's the a la carte for appetizers and small bites... there's a set menu (omakase style) and there's another a la carte menu for the sushi/sashmi orders.  I had a large group and I got to see the variety of dishes that were served.  We mainly got a few a la carte items and for myself, I got the Omakase Sushi and I shared it.  Our order: Soft Shell Crab - This was MUCH smaller than I anticipated but a good appetizer size.  With the sauce, it tasted great and good crunch.  Asides from the portion size, I would recommend it.   Miso Soup - Came with the omakase order. It was standard; some of my friends complained it was too salty.   The other appetizers my friends got came with the omakase sushi course.  It looked small but they didn't complain about the taste. Omakase Sushi - As everyone already pointed out, this is a platter for 1 person and comes with 12 pieces. From what others photos I've seen posted, it doesn't look like their \"Chef's Selection\" changes very often which is sad to see.  I split this plate with a friend and I only got to try 6 pieces - the ones I had were indeed fresh, room-temp (which is the way I like it!) and a good portion size.  I didn't hear any complaints from my friend either, other than the number of pieces.  12 pieces is average, but for $65, you're paying over $5/piece! That's a lot for say... salmon. I also like when they introduce each piece or explain what we're eating... the server did not do that for anyone at my table. And we ordered 6 omakases... Negitoro Roll - Typical handroll. I love negitoro rolls actually! But this one was average. Some of my friends weren't full and ordered some more sushi/sashimi on the side and some of my friends got ice cream for dessert as part of their set.  Our total between my friend and I ended up being $90 after tax but before tip.  That's over $50 a person for 6 pieces of sushi; half a handroll and half a soft shell crab.  If you think about it, that's pretty expensive for not even a full meal and I came into this dinner expecting to pay a lot already!  $65 for 12 pieces (excluding the handroll) is $5.40/piece.  I've been to Yasu before and that was $80 for 18 pieces (excluding handroll) and that's $4.44/piece.  Definitely more worth it and the atmosphere there was more welcoming.  The chefs actually interact with you and tell you what you're eating and where the fish came from.  The servers at Yasu were far less superior and took forever to serve us (even tea refills!).  Our dinner for 8 people spammed more than 2 hours and it's not like we ordered anything off menu (other than 3 more sushi/sashimi pieces) so I'm not sure why it took so long.  A shame since I was expecting much more for the price we paid and the high expectations I had based on reviews.  The food was good (hence the 2 stars), but for a fresh \"fish-from-around-the-world\" omakase experience with better service, you should try Yasu."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a try since visiting the Scarborough restaurant years ago, hoping it would be better.   Went for lunch. Sushi was above average but chirashi selection of fish was rather boring (salmon, tuna, ..). Was expecting better selection.  Dessert was above average but expensive (e.g. 1 small scoop of ice cream was $6.50.  Overall with tax and tip, our lunch bill for 2 was about $75. Not sure it was worth that much.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Seat at sushi bar...Zenji never let you down...best sushi in town!! Book your seat at sushi bar 2 weeks in advance to avoid disappointment..haha"}
{"text":"I ordered sashmi dinner $ 26   and  tuna belly $ 15.  Their rice is good but the dinner portion is small.   I won't return.  I prefer j-town"}
{"text":"It's the best Japanese restaurant in Toronto I think. Most fish come from Japan!!!! It's very authentic."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary and it's an awesome experience! The green tea, miso soup, edamame and tuna belly hand roll were the complimentary with the orders of omakase sushi. The sashimis were very fresh, the rice was just perfectly moist and the seaweed sheets taste absolutely delicious and crunchy.  The waiter was very friendly and he took his time explaining each and every type of sushi that was selected by the chef. I'm amazed that everything is freshly shipped from Japan. Highly recommend this place for their excellent sushi quality and service!"}
{"text":"Given its neighbourhood, I was skeptical. But Zen wowed me on all levels - service, quality, authenticity! The sushi rolls were amazing; I also especially liked the shiitake mushrooms in soy butter. My Japanese friend attested that the food is very authentic. I'd definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Zen is a find, for sure! We came here on recommendations from other reviews, and it was, to date, the best sushi we've had in T-O! As a matter of fact, I would venture to say that it was some of the freshest, most delicious seafood I've had for sushi ever. Why 4 stars? A weeknight dinner for 2 for basic sushi and two beers was over 100$ by the time we were done with tip and tax. (!!) Having had good - albeit not GREAT - all-you-can-eat sushi for 17$ (and near downtown!) I couldn't quite come to terms with it. Especially considering the sketchy mini-mall. And the fact that they were out of the beers we really wanted. So 4 stars it is.  But seriously, the ambiance is nice, it's a small place, we found the waitresses lovely, and YES - you need reservations for dinner, especially on the weekends. The first time we popped in on a Fri. it was a 1.5 hour wait.  Despite 4 stars.... I kinda have sexy dreams about the scallop sushi I had here. Mmmmmm scallop. So creamy, so sweet! Oh, it's almost embarrassing. We will be back. Oh yes, when we get paid - we will be back!"}
{"text":"Note: you must make a reservation or be warned, you will likely get turned away.  Zen is a small Japanese restaurant in a non-descript strip mall.  Do not let that stop you.... AWESOME Japanese food, freshest sushi I've had.  Very friendly staff as well.  Highly recommend but remember.... make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Wow this place shocked me today totally messed up my night, keep in mind I use to absolutely love this place I wouldn't eat sushi anywhere else but at Zen, no place in Toronto could touch this place best when it came to sushi, use to be the best sushi in the city when they were located in Scarborough, today was my first time back sins they moved, so check this I made reservation last week for tonight,went with my wife, sister and her husband  I waited for 45 minutes to be finally seated, then we get the menu and it's all changed they even took the Salmon of there Menu WTF is that how can U take salmon of the menu that's like my favourite item on the menu and the price tripled it was like all chefs pick $95 for 1 person and u don't know what ur getting they don't give u salads anymore it really changed I don't mind paying for good sushi but that was just stupid too bad everything changed"}
{"text":"My guest and I were overwhelmed by the menu because there were extra pages not shown on the website. Like \"special\" appetizers. Request to management: please update your website and include the lunch menu also.  We started with possibly the most delectable spider roll I've ever had in my life. Was that ONLY half a crab in each of the two gigantic front portions? We were entranced by the precise (and tiny) slices of perfect avocado. The outer rice casing was so delicate. What an experience. Next up an order of gyoza. The dough was sparing, the filling so alive and tasty. So far, two huge hits.  We continued with two more \"special\" appetizers. The first was foil yaki filled with seafood and enoki mushrooms cooked in butter - once again a sublime and delicate taste sensation that had to be gobbled up while hot. The second was shitake butter yaki - the familiar thick dark mushroom cut in large pieces and cooked with butter and garlic. Just let me wallow in the mastery of cooking with enough luscious butter and garlic to make the taste buds notice before subsiding so that the diner can continue on to completely different dishes.  Time to cool off with some chilled appetizers. Beef sashimi with dipping sauce was another winner though, when I scooped up something (I couldn't see) that our server later identified as radish mixed with chili, I got an unexpected blast. My mouth was on fire but, again, that taste just faded away quickly leaving me with a blank slate. The next appetizer was yakko hiya (cold tofu with ginger and dried bonito) that my guest said I could enjoy all on my own. The squares were so fresh and the garnishes so bursting with flavour that I insisted he have the last bite!  We'd already decided to share a large flask of hot sake and it certainly warmed us up. We finally decided on two full hot dinners (sukiyaki) instead of continuing with appetizers. It was a lot of food as either clear suimono or miso soup and a bowl of rice were included. I drank the sukiyaki broth down to the last drop but, if I'd had a choice, wish we could have substituted a green salad for the superfluous soup.  We were both stuffed and fuzzy so there was no room for dessert - though I'd been interested in the black sesame ice cream. Oh, well, next time. However, I wasn't about to deprive myself of a fave taste sensation, as in uni nigiri zushi served in two fresh creamy portions on rice and wrapped in crackling crisp seaweed. Oh, look, ALL gone.  I really didn't want to leave, but that just means we'll be eager to come back again. Next time, we're definitely going to have a spider roll each because that much goodness needs to be savoured fully. And, then, we'll continue our journey through more yummy goodness!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants in Toronto if not the best. We had the omakase sushi and it was fantastic. Here's what we got:  Japanese sea bream with shiso  Fluke  Hamachi Hotate Shima aji Snow crab w salt and sudachi Chu toro bluefin from halifax Uni from hokkaido Aka Ebi Toro from halifax aji (horse mackerel) from japan Unagi from japan Negitoro temaki  That was the omakase menu, then we had some extras, they were AMAZING.  Hirame Yellowtail belly Torched toro  The chef gave us a piece of Tamago at the end.  It was incredible. We will try to come back here as much as possible. Definitely a must."}
{"text":"Very pretty decor compared to the old store more modern, the wooded front design is very welcoming and makes you curious of how the inside would be.  We stood at the front for a while and a lady asked if we had reservations.. i advised her we did for 7pm at the sushi bar ( I got there at 7:12pm) and right away she apologized and said sorry but we would need to wait awhile, without a rush we said ok and waited outside...  10mins passed a man came out and offered to have us wait inside at a table while waiting for the guest at the sushi bar to finish their dinner we were offered green tea  20mins passed and finally we were able to sit at the sushi bar for dinner  The owner was advised that we were waiting patiently for our seat at the sushi bar, and the chef that was serving us tonight apologized once we were seated  We ordered: Omakase and Omakase Set  The difference between the both is Omakase - comes with miso soup Omakase set - comes with apps and dessert  The beginning of our meal was off to a bad start, because we ate sushi and then apps came which consist of something that is like a mushroom consomme but more light, cook cold fish, and trout with egg..unfortunately we weren't explained what they where ) then we ate sushi again and the owner noticed that we didn't receive our steam egg but the seating beside us that came later have already received theirs...  Once again they apologized and the owner went directly into the kitchen to sort the issue out and we got our steam egg which was very tasty! on top of the steam egg there was a clear top of ponzu and the egg was very silky smooth..yumm  We were offered the following sushi pcs-Japan Seabream, Hamachi, Scallop, Japan Amber Jack, Fluke aka Flounder, Halifax Blue fin toro, Japan Kimedai, Uni, Chile Botan Shrimp, Toro, Japan Horse Mackeral, Japan Sea Eel and lastly negi toro handroll  We side order the following - Skip jack, sea beam belly  All of the fish tasted very fresh, and just at the right temperature, they brush the soy sauce on the fish therefore you wouldn't need to do so yourself which is just perfect. We wanted to order a la carte other varieties to try but they didn't have many in stock therefore was just limited to skip jack and sea beam belly ( this was a specialty pc )  Overall my experience here was good, the owner was very attentive after knowing our experience was bumpy and kept checking on us to make sure we were satisfied and full. We got complimentary desert and the side order of sushi for having such an venturous night.  DESERT was AMAZING ! in house ice cream !! home made tofu ice cream with red bean was so unique ! and Matcha ice green was so silky, creamy and smooooooth !  They get fresh fish every Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday and was advised that Friday would be the best day to go.   They don't have a liqour licence yet but the owner advised should be ready in 2 weeks.  i would definitely come back here and try other fishes that they have available a la carte"}
{"text":"Best authentic sushi restaurant in GTA. Everything is fresh and good. This is my go-to restaurant for celebrations."}
{"text":"First point to note is that the area is definitely a bit..interesting. Or you can substitute interesting for intimidating. A bit sketchy especially at night but all I can say is that once you eat here it might even be worth coming back even if it was in the ghetto of the ghettos!  I haven't had the omakase that a lot of people have raved about on here and other sites but everything else is just as good! I've ordered a-la-carte with my friend a few times and the toro and hotate is to die for! Every time we eat anywhere else we always find ourselves relating back to Zen and how its better. Another fave is the spicy tuna roll, yum yum!  Service can be a hit or miss for some as it's the basics. Depending on which waitress you get, there may be a slight issue with communicating.   The decor is nothing special as well and doesn't look like it has been updated in years but that's not what you go to Zen for-you go for the food!!  Overall really fresh sashimi that's melt in your mouth goodness!"}
{"text":"This is it.  There is no other place for sushi in the GTA but here. Shame we've lost Mikado as Masuda-san is enjoying retirement now.  Go for the omakase - spring and get the real thing. We had blue fin tekka maki rolls that are lodged in permanent memory and beyond.  One last hint: their tonkatsu is by far the best I've tasted outside Japan. Don't worry about the location - worry about the fact you have not been there yet."}
{"text":"I almost didn't want to write this review because I wanted to keep this little known secret to myself.  This is the BEST japanese restaurant in Toronto in my opinion.  I've been to Kaji, Mikado, and other popular japanese restaurants but I stand by this one.  The fish is ALWAYS fresh, the sushi pieces melts in your mouth.  I would recommend sitting at the sushi bar and ordering the Omakase menu as the sushi chefs will explain to you the fish you are eating.  Dessert there is as awesome as their sashimi.  Mandarin Pie and Sesame Ice Cream is a must.  The staff are super friendly and polite.  This is a genuine Japanese owned Japanese restaurant.  The only thing is that this restaurant is a pricier than most, but again, in my opinion, worth every single penny."}
{"text":"The quality of the fish here is top notch and the sushi chefs are masterful.  I would highly recommend reserving a seat at the sushi bar so you can see all the action up close...it's seriously impressive.  The chefs and wait staff were all extremely polite, attentive and friendly.    We each ordered the omakase sushi course, which included an assortment of appetizers, a good variety of sushi, and dessert.  We also ordered blue fin tuna a la carte, which was melt in your mouth goodness.  For $85, I think the sushi omakase is very good value.  I left feeling full and satisfied. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I think people are exaggerated to give 5 stars and saying how excellent it is, or they have never tried good Japanese before. I am not saying its bad but everything is ordinary. The service, decor and most importantly the quality of food are ordinary. We ordered 2 salmon terriyaki, 1 chicken terriyaki, sashimi dinner, toro, hamachi and a sake. The terriyaki dinner are ordinary but the price are not, they cost 18 bucks for each. The sashimi are ordinary grade but they charge 26 for the set. Lets talk about the toro, the tuna belly, which is not even medium grade, they are not fatty. 2 thin and small slices cost 15 bucks. I can have better quality fish in Aoyama or Cafe Michi for the same price. Nevertheless , I will go back for one more time to see if they will improve."}
{"text":"It's the best sushi you can get in Toronto. Make sure you reserve seats for omakase at the sushi bar because the chefs will apply the soy sauce for you and present you each piece one at a time. Also, they give you recommendations on what is especially good that day. If you order omakase at the table it is not as good because it comes all at once on a plate and for serious sushi lovers, timing is everything. The rice will be less warm and you will have to apply the soy sauce yourself, where if you're not careful you could apply too much.   If you are eating at the sushi bar please uphold good sushi eating etiquette. Eat the piece of sushi as soon as it is put on your plate. For those degenerate foodies who have to take a picture of EVERYTHING they eat (myself included), take a quick picture and then eat the sushi ASAP! Also I would suggest using your hands to eat the sushi as it will allow the chef to pack the rice less densely.   Hope you enjoy your meal at Zen!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations when I was told that my bf had made reservations here.  I had read so many positive reviews so couldn't wait to check it out.  We arrive and were seated promptly.  The location was skeptical as it is in a strip mall two doors down from a strip joint.  So we proceeded on ordering Omakase at $52.  We ordered both the sushi and sashimi Omakase.  So we were told upfront that the Sashimi Omakase does not come with Miso soup.  We also ordered a spider roll ....which I can safely say was one of the best I've ever had.  The Omakase Sashimi on the other hand was ok.  The pieces were thinly sliced.  The presentation was ok.  The fish was fresh.  But there was not much wow factor or anything to rave about.  The Uni was very fresh and had a good texture. The rest of the fish was flavorful and fresh.  There was simply a lack of wow factor in the presentation and the taste.  For $52, I expected something more.  I also asked why there was no ginger. Apparently it only comes with the Sushi Omakase as per the tradition. Also, the Sushi Omakase came with a crispy seaweed hand wrap which did not come with the Sashimi Omakase.  No miso and no ginger and no seaweed wrap??  By the looks of it, the sashimi Omakase slices were so thin that I don't think I got more fish than the Sushi Omakase....All in all, it was an ok experience. I don't think I would go back there unless it was for lunch for the Chirachi with the side of Udon noodle as the others have been raving about. I was still hungry after spending $52 + $13.50 (spider roll) + tax and tip.  The inside was pretty crammed. You could hear the conversations at the other tables and it felt as though we could have been a fly on the wall while you witnessed couples on dates.  The place feels very traditional but could most likely use a bit of reno.  The service was good.  Overall the experience was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Omakase sushi price increased ever since they moved to the new location. Fresh high quality fish though. Mandarin orange pie always to end the meal."}
{"text":"Cost: expensive (top 10% I would say) Quality: very good - 90% Decor: poor to average - 70% Staff: friendly - 80% Value: 70%  Keeper? 100% yes will return. We have tried multiple items including the omasake sushi, which is very costly for 11 pieces ($45) but top-notch quality fish.  - standard shop lot (small) in a not-so-good neighborhood - one of a few sushi restaurants that offers real wasabi (not tube or powder) but have to ask for it and you get charged $7 due to rarity and labor (we didn't order) - teriyaki beef, sushi, maki... A+; miso soup, tempura... A; udon soup... B+ - we ordered the notorious Natto (fermented soy bean), no where near stinky tofu, but is sure an acquired taste too, especially the gooey texture, pretty gross, we finished it and even my 7 year-old liked it - we also ordered another delicacy - mountain potato with tuna, also gooey texture and I liked it better than Natto."}
{"text":"This place has the best tasting fish. You can taste each type of fish, which is rare in Toronto. Definetely recommand to come here.  It's just at a weird location."}
{"text":"We've been regulars at Zen for the past 15 years.  Delighted to see their new location with stunning upscale décor and new omakase \"course\" offerings in addition to their omakase sushi/sashimi main dishes.  A little sad that prices went up quite a bit with their expansion or upgrade though not really a surprise to us!  For the longest time, desserts is Zen's weakest link.  Oh no, not anymore!  The dessert platter served as part of their omakase course is definitely one of the best Japanese desserts in my books.  (Almost at par with Sushi Kaji's!)  So the $20 increment for the \"course\" is well worth it!  You get a somen (noodle soup) in lieu of misoshiru (miso soup), an assorted appetizer plate (OMG!  Soooo good!) plus a dessert platter (Yum!!!).  If you plan to dine there on the weekend, book well in advance.  And if you prefer sushi counter seating, call at least one week in advance, esp for weekends.  No longer open for lunch!  Closed Mon."}
{"text":"Was hyped about this place, but the experience was sorely lacking.  The surrounding area is pretty shady, and the restaurant interior is pretty dated.   The service was non attentive and lacking.   The soup/salad is pretty much the same as any other japanese joint. Ordered a Sushi and Sashimi lunch.    Why is there a fake crab stick sushi on my plate?  I thought this place was authentic.  The sashimi is cut so small its smaller than my baby pinky finger.  Is that how they eat their sashimi in Japan?"}
{"text":"Environment is good, service is good.  However, Food quality is so so. I can say over price for what you can get here."}
{"text":"A gem of a place -- they know their sushi, and it sure is one legit establishment!   While dining at a regular table is just fine, dining at the sushi bar and interacting with the chefs is even better. The chefs take the time to tell you a bit about each item you're about to enjoy (i.e. what it is and where it's from). They're also more than happy to answer any questions you may have and maybe offer some advice on how best to enjoy your food! But please note: certain items, like the sushi kaiseki menu, are not available at the sushi bar and served at a regular table only.  Reservations are a must. You won't regret it. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"We were regulars at Zen back when they were in Scarborough, their sushi quality is the only one that's comparable to Kaji in town.  Aside from the great quality sushi/sashimi, they also make AMAZING tonkatsu, which unfortunately is off the new menu since they moved to Markham, I was so sad!   Since they moved, the price point just gone off the roof, Kaji definitely is a better choice to go now. We still come here for take out once a month, but for dine in... Kaji is much better value.   Their mandarin pie is heavenly, I am not a pie fan - but the only pie I eat is from here."}
{"text":"Awesome experience, definitely unique and the chef was very knowledgeable...all the selections for our sushi were excellent! My husband was super impressed and so was I. Worth all the money we paid...my husband already took two of his friends there."}
{"text":"It's my go to Japanese restaurant in Scarborough bc of the quality.  The customer service is superior.  Since its  always hard to get a table I order take out.     My favourite us the sashimi dinner a shrimp tempura roll (they use two shrimps and their mayo sauce is delicious)."}
{"text":"This restaurant was originally located on Danforth and Eglington so when I heard they relocated to Markham, there was no reason to not go.   Zen definitely lived up to my expectations with its high quality fresh fish. It is not your typical sushi restaurant where there is a section for appetizers, tempura, rolls, bento box etc. The main menu consists of 4 set dinners, each of which is for 1 person. It may be a bit pricey but for the quality of the fish, it's definitely worth it. My dad and I ordered one sushi and one sashimi dinner to share. Each piece of sushi used a different type of fish and the waitress named all of them when she placed the plate down. The service was excellent, servers were really polite and knew what they were talking about.   The restaurant is quite small so a reservation may be necessary. The place itself used very simple decor, nothing too flashy and stereotypical Japanese decoration. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Truly one of (if not) the best Japanese restaurants in Toronto. I have been visiting regularly over the last 7+ years and I have never been disappointed. Seiichi and his team put quality before everything else. Simply a must visit if you're in Toronto. They offer special fishes throughout the year which are normally not available anywhere else in the city."}
{"text":"You need to visit this gem RIGHT NOW! I had the lunch special #10 and ordered the tuna roll, hatate and shrimp sushi from the a la carte menu. The freshness of the fish and the texture of the rice blew my mind. This restaurant definitely deserves a 5-star rating!!!"}
{"text":"I do not appreciate their service but I keep on going there. What can you do when the choice are so limited for authentic Japanese restaurants? I can only think of a few worth mentioning when it comes to fine Japanese cuisine, Hashimoto, Kaji, and may be Aoyama and Inakaya, that's about it!"}
{"text":"By far the best quality sushi I've had in Scarborough. Much more than Niji. I've had sushi from the fish markets in Japan and this comes very close.  Such a sketchy location for a premium sushi bar. But the interior has a pleasant atmosphere (when it isn't busy) to make up for it.   Japanese operated. The preparation is taken seriously. The fish is the freshest you'll get in Scarborough. The color of the nigiri is vibrant and shiny.   I had the spider maki spicy tuna - can honestly say it's the best I've ever had. Because the fish is so fresh, its full of flavor that melts in your mouth.  Only complaint is that the dinner menu is fairly pricey for Scarborough. Definitely worth it though. Try to go for lunch to get the best bang for your buck.  Had a wonderful experience for the first time. Definitely coming back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by a friend as it supposedly has \"Toronto's freshest sashimi\". I had really high hopes and it didn't fail me!  The restaurant is quite small, and we sat by a table next to the entrance. Waitresses were attentive. I think they have timers for each table so they know when to check up on guests.  Onto the food - We got the Tokujyo Zushi, which had 14 pieces of sushi. This platter has more specialty sushi than the Jyo Zushi, including scallop and yellowtail. I agree, the sashimi is really fresh! Some pieces were practically melting in my mouth.. mm..   We also got the Beef Tataki which I enjoyed even more. The sides were pan fried with a lot of black pepper, unlike the thinly sliced pieces you'd get from AYCE places. It was served with pieces of green onion and carrots, which added a hint of freshness to the raw beef.   Zen didn't cheap out on the crab meat for our spider roll either. The individual pieces were huge and delicious. The crab taste dominated the rest of the ingredients for once!   Toronto's freshest sashimi? Probably. However, this place is quite expensive. I would only come back for the sashimi and beef tataki. I'll need to save up for a couple of months if I wanted to have a 4-course meal here!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a seedy area of Scarborough. You got a massage parlor on the left and adult entertainment on the right.  Make it a night of raw and exciting entertainment? Ha-ha not.  We came here for the food.  Open the door and step through the front curtain you're presented with a simple clean décor. Sushi bar to the right, tables for two and four lining the edges, and some booths located at the back. All the tables were reserved when we arrived. Glad we made reservations in advance.    Not here to experiment with selections we ordered some basics. I ordered a chiarasi $25 that comes with with clear fish broth soup, my fiancée ordered 2 rolls: a shrimp tempura and custom spicy scallop roll for $8, finished off with black sesame ice cream $4 for dessert.  Wait time for the food to arrive was good about 10-12 minutes. The chirashi had a wide variety of sushis: clams, scallops, octopus, mackerel, salmon, salmon roe it's fresh, very basic and traditional, nothing fancy. The rolls were made well and tasted great. Black sesame ice cream was good too.  (I eat sushi with no wasabi or soy by the way, not to hide any flavors or cover-up any lack of freshness)   Service was alright, but when we ask for something it gets lost in translation. Polite but not warm.    The restaurant has fresh basic sushi, but the location of it makes for an interesting experience."}
{"text":"Owner/Chef Seiichi Kashiwabara took over the restaurant in the year 2000 and has had a local following of customers since.   There were 4 of us and we ordered the omakase (chefs selection), as well as from the regular menu. My husband and I shared the sashimi and sushi omakas.    The omakase experience was so spectacular, it did not matter that the restaurant was in a strip mall in a sketchy looking part of Scarborough, or that it was beside a vacant store, a \"spa\" AND a strip club.  Each bite of the fish served made me feel like I was in an intimate restaurant in Japan. This was the closest experience to what I imagine it would be like eating at Chef Jiro Ono restaurant in Japan (\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\"), where the passionate chef chooses what fish to serve.  For the sushi omakase, the fish was served in a successive order, one-at-a time. As I sat at the sushi bar, there was uncontrollable drool as I watched the chef prepare each masterpiece. Following the chefs recommendation, soy sauce was brushed on each sushi prior to serving with wasabi placed in between each sushi piece.  The sashimi omakase order included but not limited to toro (tuna), regular tuna belly, medium tuna belly, sea bream with yuzu, shrimp, uni (sea urchin), octopus, skipjack, hamachi, mackerel, fluke and king fish.  The fish selection and quality was outstanding! Each bite was divine, mouth-watering and heavenly.  As a consensus, our party favourite was the toro and uni sushi, so we had to order additional pieces to satisfy our sushi needs.  Also, compared to other tasting menus, Zen Sushi was the best bang for buck at $52.50! Amazing!   Other dishes I would recommend are:  *Broiled beef tongue-It was well seasoned and tender.  *Broiled squid-There was a good bounce to the squid meat.  *Salmon neck- It was full of flavour!  *Home-made mandarin pie- It was light and fluffy  Overall:  I have a lot of love for this little restaurant. There is so much pride and love from the owners/chefs at the restaurant and you can taste it with every bite."}
{"text":"Great fresh sushi. Go for lunch if you don't want to break the bank. Very nice staff and great ambiance."}
{"text":"Zen is an old time favourite. I've been dining with them since they were in Scarborough. This is still the place to go for premium sushi and sashimi.  The decor at this new location is modern, high end. The menu is no fuss traditional sushi. You come here for fresh tasting sushi. You won't find the gimmicky mayo laced Maki rolls here. Be warned, prices here are at a premium to match the quality. (Example, $80 for 13 pieces of sushi. )  Tonight I was pleasantly surprised when i tried the Japanese mackerel topped with onions ginger. Wow! What a pop of flavour. Clean, fresh taste. Didn't expect that from mackerel.  Tip one: sit at the bar and order sushi to get full bar experience as they present you with each piece one at a time.   Tip two: order the Mandarin Orange pie! Refreshing, light.  I gave this review 4 stars because i was very disappointed with their rice in the sushi. It fell apart upon picking up. Boo. That's a big no in my books. Especially for a Japanese restaurant of this stature."}
{"text":"food was amazing quite a surprise as you would not think it is so amazing from the outside. This is a small venue and you will need to call for a reservation... great service fresh well made meal. The sashimi was quality and very fresh the tempura was great and I loved the spider roll of soft shelled crab.."}
{"text":"We had the sashimi and sushi omakase here, unlike other omakases, all your food is served at once here (experience may be different if sitting at the bar). You get about 18 pieces of sashimi for $60. The sushi came with a delicious aromatic miso soup, about 12 pieces of sushi and a salmon roll, where they used a special roasted seaweed.   The fish is very fresh and flavourful, some of the best I've had in Toronto. The sushi came with a little too much wasabi, but not to the point where it ruined the sushi.   Dessert was good, had the roasted green tea ice cream, black sesame tofu mousse and the Mandarin Orange pie. The pie was ok, light with hints of Mandarin. The ice cream had a very strong grassy flavour, which is nice if you like green tea. Black sesame was the best, light but very flavourful.   Overall this is a good place although pricey. I feel you can get fish that almost as good, if not on par for cheaper at other restaurants. But this is a good place if you have money to spend and are looking for some really good sushi/sashimi."}
{"text":"Another scarcity main stay. I lived right down the street from this place for years. It has been around forever and is ranked in the top 5 of all time sushi places in toronto and for a great reason. Super fresh and super quality sushi and sashimi. Great for a date night or to impress your queen west friends with a local hideaway. So unassuming in a strip mall off of Eglinton Ave East.  great service and amazing sushi!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and sat both at the sushi bar and the dining tables. The 3 star review is based on both experiences and averages out to 3. The sushi bar experience was far more superior to the dining table experience I had with my parents. The fish here is always fresh and service is amazing.   Let me start out with the bad. Ordered the same omakase option both times but was served very mediocre sushi. The ika was so tough and chewy we couldn't even bite it in half. And no, it wasnt because it wasnt ika, it really was ridiculously tough. The waitress initially suggested the same thing but I had the same piece from twice and only one of them came out like that.   Similar to other reviews, the dining table set was not brushed with sauce or garnished that night. Another disappointment. When the chef serves the sushi at the sushi bar, each piece is carefully garnished with lime or sea salt or yuzu or whatever the piece goes with.   So onto the good, the sushi bar is always the best experience because I love watching the sushi get made and the sushi isn't sitting around and waiting to be served. I would recommend only booking the sushi bar. Zen fills up even in weekdays so be sure to ask for it when making reso.   One last tip, ask for less rice if you're not a big eater. The omakase is pretty filling and all the food adds up and the last negitoro roll is delicious. So save room!"}
{"text":"Umami!   For the full plaza experience.   Order the omakase - sushi  Eat the ginger to cleanse your pallet after each piece  Order the mandarin cream pie Walk next door, do some bowling. After bowling have a beer and a show at caddies."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday to celebrate a special occasion for dinner. I was told that it was one of the tops ranked sushi place to go too uptown. I didn't get the wow factor here, the food was good but it wasn't the best as I expected.   The sushi and nigiri had a fresh taste to it, but I can honestly say it's comparable to certain sushi places that are half the price from their menu. I ordered the the omakase ( sashimi, and sushi ) some of their steaks and appetizers. Their appetizers didn't please me as much! The only thing I liked was the black cod. I felt like it wasn't as worth it for the cost they charged and the portion! But it was a good experience to try out."}
{"text":"I went to Zen with high hopes, but was slightly disappointed in the overall experience. The high of the meal was the sashimi omakase set. The fish is probably some of the freshest I have ever had in Toronto. It melts in the mouth. The handroll set was also delicious with the perfect rice to fish ratio (though a bit heavy on the wasabi).    Unfortunately, all I have to say for the rest of the meal was that it was small portioned, over priced and underwhelming. I ordered various appetizers including the Deep-Fried Soft Shell Crab, Fried Shiitake Mushrooms and Grated Japanese Potato with Tuna. Soft Shell Crab was greasy and dry.   I would come back for the sushi/sashimi and try some of their set menu, but the rest of the menu was just A-okay."}
{"text":"The minute you walk through the doors, you immediately feel the Zen atmosphere. A tiny zen rock garden sits behind the door, and back-lit lights beams through the soft coloured wooden slats featuring the Zen logo in the middle of the hallway leading you into the restaurant itself.  Inside, the prominent feature is the large sushi bar where four chefs work swiftly to slice fish, remove pinbones, and deftly shape rice into sushi pieces.  If you sit at the bar, you can have the option to have them served piece by piece to eat them at optimal freshness.  Perhaps before you decide to come here for dinner, you should know that Zen is pricey.  Dinners are omakase only, and you can choose from one of three price ranges: $65 for miso soup, 12 pieces of sushi, and one handroll.  The other prices were about ~$85 followed by ~$100.  This is where my primary issue with Zen lies - I don't feel that the pricing is justified for what you receive.  The rice tastes pretty much like plain rice to me.  It doesn't do a lot to enhance the flavour of the fish.  Several times, the rice would crumble apart before the piece reached my mouth - despite my careful swipe in soy sauce, fish-side down, even picking up the sushi with my fingers instead of chopsticks.  The same thing happened to my dining companions.  The soy sauce was definitely not Kikkoman, but it didn't seem to have any distinguishing features either.  If memory recalls correctly, diners at the sushi bar didn't have soy sauce dishes, as the sushi was brushed with sauce prior to serving.  I wish it was the same for table-diners.  The fish was fresh, but not so amazing that I haven't had better elsewhere in Toronto.  The wasabi ratio was not exactly the same for each diner, so while one had a large glob for one diner, another exact piece had hardly any.    The negitoro handroll served after the sushi plate was pretty good.  Filled with  negitoro and shaped like a sausage roll, the seaweed was perfectly crispy.  Service was very, very slow.  We waited 50 minutes for the sushi to arrive. The service was friendly, but there wasn't much of it.  The paper which was wrapped around our (made in Japan!) chopsticks was never picked up/discarded.  Our table was skipped for tea refills a couple of times, though other tables were offered another pour.  The kindly waitstaff apologized for the long wait, but 50 minutes is a long time.  Maybe it's because we came at a late hour.  Due to the popularity of this restaurant, we nabbed the last spot possible at 9pm.  Based solely on my experience this weekend though, I can't help but wonder what made Zen so popular in the first place.  By the way: if you're wondering about the previous Scarborough location, I've been told that it now belongs to a different (Japanese) owner. All in all, I'd still want to come back and try it again, but maybe after giving them a bit of time to work out the serving pace..."}
{"text":"Such a strange location for such an upscale Japanese experience.  But after you park your car at the shady plaza and make sure you've secured all your valuable belongings...you step inside and enter another world.  I love sitting at the bar and watching the sushi experts in action.  It's really like a dance, the way they use their knives, the way they work with rice...and how they plate everything.  The seaweed that wraps their sushi has become my benchmark for what a seaweed wrap should be.  Fresh, crispy and flavourful.  I think it's because they ship it directly from Japan (you can see the chefs taking each piece out carefully from a small tin box).    I also love the freshly ground wasabi.  Nothing like the paste that has defined wasabi in mainstream Japanese restaurants designed for mass consumption.    Zen is really all about being zen when it comes to Japanese food.  It's not frantic (as I've seen some sushi chefs), it's not about eating huge portions, and it's not about ordering off the menu.  I have on a few occasions, left myself at the mercy of the sushi chefs and always been delighted at the resulting meal.  Of course the only downside is the price.  Going off the menu can be costly...but that's why I look forward to every visit!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I have ever had. Expertly crafted right in front of your eyes and service to match. Quite pricey though--60 a person. But incredible sushi."}
{"text":"Yes it's true what they say! It's in a ghetto strip Plaza. Sorry I can't remember what I ordered but everything was quite good. Uni was really fresh. Would definitely come back sometime!"}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*  Yup. As with all the other reviews, the location of this place is unspectacular. But, as all other reviews have pointed out, who cares! The food more than makes up for the small-plaza location.  RESERVATIONS ARE A MUST. Don't try walking in. We saw so many people get turned away with no reservations. It's because it is a small place and it seems family run?  We didn't get to try many items as our entire table ordered the set menu which is a very good deal. The sushi was fresh and soft.  I would really like to come back here to try more sashimi items, but I couldn't see myself coming here as a regular. I am still a Nami fan (downtown) and nothing beats that place for Japanese (IMO).  However, I can see why this place is busy. The food is very good."}
{"text":"Zen now has their liquor license, so I returned to try their food again. I must say, it's difficult not to come back all the time!   This time, I was able to catch a seat at the bar. You'll want to book at least a few days in advance for one, and perhaps a week in advance if you want to snag a seat there. The bar is usually better because you get served piece by piece personally by the chefs, which creates a more intimate experience, and also allows the chef to control the pace and progression of the meal and the fish in an optimal way.   I had their full course menu. I didn't go for the sake, but I did note that they have a pretty good selection (and I ended up having some Asahi Black, which is a great, 'stouty' beer)   In my previous experience, I wasn't able to have as many cooked items. This time, I was able to sample more of their offerings. Stand-outs include: the best tamago I have ever eaten (check the picture; notice how there are pretty much no air pockets!) with its slightly custardy texture and flavour; a perfect slab of miso-marinated salmon with a super crispy skin, and a beautiful piece of shima aji.   Unfortunately, I was unable to have Zen's special Kawahagi (he told me that many people have asked him, but he only serves this during the winter), but as the meal offered will change with the seasons, I will definitely be looking forward to my next experience at Zen!  For a full review of their entire course menu with more pictures, please feel free to check out my food blog, located conveniently in my profile.   Happy feasting!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding!!!! It's pricey, but worth every penny!!! Great service! Great food!!! Great atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my husband who is a fanatic for \"authentic\" anything.  He wanted to eat at the sushi bar and have the tasting menu so he gets one piece at a time.  You can probably pick out his review.  Personally, I love Japanese food but I don't really care much for sushi or sashimi.  I liked the menu at their old location in Scarborough, but when they moved they dropped most of the things I liked in favor of all sushi/sashimi with a few hot appetizers.  :-( So while he had the tasting menu, I got a selection of appetizers for my meal.  First I got the kuro-ton, which was basically a tonkastu made with Berkshire pork and served with the traditional katsu sauce.  This was one of the better tonkatsu I have had, although a place down in Pensacola, Florida, still takes first place.  Next was the gindara saikyo yaki which was grill black cod marinated in miso which was quite good.  Finally, was the tempura which was a very nice selection of veggies and a couple of shrimp.  The veggies included pumpkin, yam, eggplant, lotus root, snow peas, and shitake mushrooms along with the traditional dipping sauce.  This was probably some of the best tempura I have had.  Would I go back?  Probably since my husband will want to and I will go with him.  Would I go on my own?  Probably not because they really are more focused on sushi and sashimi which I don't care much for."}
{"text":"I miss the old Zen on Eglinton near Danforth Road.  It had great food with lots of choices for the non-sushi fanatic.  The new place is lovely and the food looks beautiful.  However, prices are really high and I don't see the value for the money.   The cheapest sushi set meal is 80.00.  While there are some exotic items it was not way better than Gonoe Sushi.  My beef dish with exotic beef and a few vegetables In a broth was nice but it was not enough for a meal.  The scallop sushi I added on was really good.  My son ordered a tempura appetizer for the table, again very good.  That saved the meal for me.  He enjoyed his combo  meal with the base sushi and some interesting appetizers.  However the bill was the highest we have ever paid for a meal and I am not rushing back.  The place was full so there is an audience for the food."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Japanese restaurants all over Toronto, and I have to say that Zen really does offer some of the best food around. All these places serve fresh fish, expertly-made nigiri, and other such delicious Japanese things, and while a lot of the top-tier places like Zen are pretty close quality-wise, it's the little things that set it apart from everywhere else.  I went for lunch today, had a Chirashi for $15. This came with a salad with a standard salad dressing that you find on many complimentary Japanese salads, but it had an additional slight kick from freshly ground black pepper.   I didn't get a miso soup like all the other Japanese places that serve lunch combos. Instead, they brought out an udon noodle with this delicious kombu, bonito broth filled to the brim with magnificent, delightful flavor. I know most of us don't opt to finish the soup that comes with the udon noodles for fear of MSG or what not -- but for the first time in years, I downed all the soup as well! The noodles were also magnificent. It had the perfect, slightly bouncy consistency without being rubbery, and it was smooth and silky.   When the Chirashi arrived, I knew I was in for a treat. That piece of hamachi looked like a delightfully marbled steak, and it tasted buttery and meaty just like it should be. When it came to the maguro, there is simply no comparison. There is no other place in Toronto where I've had tuna where there is no slightly metallic aftertaste. it's hard to explain, but if you've had tuna in enough Japanese places, you might know what I mean! Anyways, this tuna was instead very delicate, with just a hint of fishy flavor rather than an overbearing amount that would require an overdosage of soysauce and wasabi to overcome.  Speaking of the wasabi, this restaurant was using a combination blend of the fresh and standard wasabi that we usually have at Japanese places. Honestly, very very good and their lunch specials are incredible. In Scarborough, there's probably no other place like it other than Aoyama (Where the hours are a little weirder).  A MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I really enjoy Japanese food especially Omakase; but we have quite high expectation especially when comparing with Japan's standards. However Zen was great! Taking into consideration of the convenient location and the price point (Sushi Omakase $80) (Sashimi Omakase $90) (Omakase sushi set $110) (2nd Omakase sushi set $120) it is definitely worth it and yummy. We had the $110 set each and it was very good; the appetizers and side sides were all good and unique worth the price difference from regular Omakase. I highly recommend to always reserve to eat at sushi bar because piece by piece sushi service makes a huge difference and alway request for chef Seichii.   : ) Enjoy~*"}
{"text":"NOM! If you haven't dined here yet, you are truly missing out.  Beats some of the best sushi joints in the downtown core and worth the trip to Markham.  Don't let the dodgy location fool you, this place is legit on the inside.  I highly recommend reserving seats at the bar and getting the chef special over the omakase because it is strictly sushi pieces and the chef gets pretty creative - think seared toro on uni on toro or scallop thats tastes like butter.  Salivating yet? Get the handroll... this isn't your typically ayce handroll - smaller, less rice but packed with flavour.  Even the tamago (egg sushi) is a mind-blower.   If you're celebrating a birthday or any other special occasion they provide a great presentation of their desserts. Expensive but every bite is worth every dollar."}
{"text":"I wish I had more pictures for you as Zen sushi is top notch for sushi.  Zen is located in seedy strip mall in Scarborough down the street from a notorious strip club and a newsworthy raided massage parlor.  However, the chef and owner Seiichi Kashiwabara, servicing sushi lovers for 28 years, still serves one of the highest quality, freshest, best selection and mouth watering dishes in Toronto.  I would be there weekly if it were not so far from where I live.                                                                                                                                         The chef and his staff are glad to share their knowledge of sushi and their offerings.  One conversation I remembered centered around sushi lovers favorite, butterfish.  We were discussing his Bluefin o-toro, the prize cut from the prized fish and why many people do not ask for it and butterfish came up.  I knew that many consumers, restaurants and even the fishmongers do not know what butterfish actually is.  It is enjoyed by many due to the high fat content making it buttery and flavorful.  The sous chef advised they do not like to carry it as it is not a fish that is ideal for human consumption.  The fat content that makes it so attractive can cause health issues as it is a type of fat humans cannot digest.  Butterfish is really the Escolar but is also known as Hawaiin Walu or an Alaskan fish amongst other things and is not intended for eating.  Too bad as I remember it to be one of my favorites.   This dish is Toro-Toromo.  Looks like a typo right?  I assure you it is not.  It is tuna and Japanese mountain potato.  It is served similar to natto with the Toromo having a gelatinous texture and a subtle taste worthy to be a vessel for any star ingredient.  In this case it is tuna.  If your Japanese restaurant does not have natto or toromo, then maybe you should eat somewhere else.  Where is the salmon?  Ha, great question and you should comment on its absence.  Perfect sashimi platter of what fresh fish was available on that day, for that season, regardless of popularity.    So many of you may have eaten or even ordered what is called Saba or Mackerel.  Not Spanish mackerel (aji) but Mackerel.  Mackerel in raw form has to be cured before served due to its unique attraction to unfriendly human things.  Since it is not fresh or raw it is actually mass produced and most restaurants buy a them in frozen packages.  Gross.  What does Zen do?  They proudly purchase Mackerel fresh, cure it themselves with vinegar amongst other things and serve it as a delightful nigiri plate.  So, so, so, good!  Zen has a unique offering for sushi and some decent mix drinks.  I order only Asahi Black where I can find it but I drank their last bottle and was forced to drink the generic version.  Feel pity for me and comment on your Asahi Black opinions and of course what you think of Zen Sushi."}
{"text":"Zen is located in the outskirts of the city. To be more specific, it's located in a rundown strip plaza in sketchville. Zen is the definition of a hidden gem.   Be warned -  after eating here, you'll become a pretentious sushi critic and will no longer feel satisfied eating at another sushi restaurant. I'd recommend you dig out your big boy stretchy jeans and make the drive there.   - Make a reservation a solid week before you go here. - Request seating at the chef's table because nothing is better than watching the chefs skillfully make your food.  - Order the omakase - it's a great deal; your taste buds and your stomach will thank you.  - Order the tofu salad to start and the house's mandarin dessert to celebrate how amazing that meal was.  Although this restaurant may be far for some, consider it being closer than Japan.   Eat here."}
{"text":"Best omakase. Absolutely love love love.  End your meal with a piece of tomago. So sweet. So good. Piece of heaven.  The new location is absolutely stunning."}
{"text":"I've been going to Zen since their Scarborough days and even though I've been coming to this restaurant for many years, I'm always pleasantly surprised that they somehow manage to make what's an already perfect meal even more so.   I had a very enjoyable meal at Zen last night (March 1) for Sake Night with a flight from Koshi No Kanbai. Their sake is made in the Niigata prefecture which is known for its fresh water and pristine snow. This  contributes to great conditions for growing rice and fermenting sake.  My favourite sake from Koshi No Kanbai was their Ginjo Bessen followed very closely by Junmai Daiginjo Kinmuku.  This sake flight along with Zen's beautiful and flavorful Sushi Kaiseki made for an excellent pairing.  As so many others have mentioned, sitting at Zen's sushi bar is a must and while I did enjoy the Kaiseki, the Omakase--where you put your trust in the sushi chef--is a fantastic experience. The chefs are engaging and fun to watch and they always try to answer a patron's  questions.  Hopefully I won't take so long for a return visit to Zen!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Review to follow. Go before the restaurant moves to Markham if you live further south. Opt for omakase."}
{"text":"Went to Zen for their Kaiseki dinner for my girlfriend's birthday.  We both loved the experience as the food was interesting and tasty.   Like Yasu, Zen provides a very unique experience in Japanese cuisine. Unlike Yasu which is more traditional and only offers nigiri, Zen offers Kaiseki dinners which is the Japanese term for multi-course dinners.   Everything was delicious. Initially, none of the appetizers looked very appealing to me but each item was surprisingly refreshing and delicious. Definitely was caught off guard at how tasty everything was.   There were some downfalls though. The broth and noodles were very underwhelming. It was tasty, but it was just noodles in a broth. What is with the Japanese putting tempura in broth? It makes it soggy. It's a waste and a shame. Serve it separately. Also, the sushi rice in some of the nigiri pieces actually FELL OFF. It's crazy that a high end restaurant couldn't get sushi rice to stick together to me.   However, the highlights were really high. The cod was absolutely amazing. The wagyu beef was 100% memorable and delicious and the sashimi at this place is ridiculously fresh and tasty.   Highly recommend the Kaiseki for a special occasion with a loved one."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  Where do you find fresh and authentic sushi?  In a sketchy strip mall in the heart of Scarborough of course!    Right when you walk in, you notice the majority of the patrons are Japanese and/or speaking Japanese (always a good sign!).  We had a reservation and sat at the sushi bar.  Omakase.  That was the order for the night.    At first, after reading several reviews, I wasn't sure if 11 pieces would be enough.  I was wrong.    The service was paced extremely well.  We started with a complimentary appetizer of cooked fish, followed by piping hot miso soup.  The green tea was regularly topped up.  The sushi started off with fluke and some other types of white fish (amberjack and yellowtail included).  We had scallop, sweet shrimp, sea urchin, fatty tuna, and amazing eel.  The topper was the hand roll.  Negitoro in the most crispy, tasty seaweed I've ever had!    The chefs were all really nice.  I should've asked for our chef's name.  Beyond prepping and serving, they chatted with the patrons, regulars and newbies.    I wanted to try the famous dessert but I didn't have room!  My husband ordered an extra piece of toro aburi style and said it was delicious.    I would definitely come back.  Thanks for the memorable meal!  I wish I was close enough to come for the lunch specials..."}
{"text":"Om nom nom! If you're looking for a delicious sushi joint in Markham, this is your place. Now I'm not going to lie, it's not cheap. But the fish here is wonderful, and the chefs are magical. Book well in advance as they are a reservation-only sort of place (you can maybe call on a weekday and luck out with a 5:30 reservation for 2), and it's not really a kid friendly place (though I have seen people bring their little ones along).   I've been here twice now: once to try their sushi set, and another time to have a chef's choice $150 meal. Both times were fantastic. The chef's choice, if you ever get the chance, is great. You basically tell the sushi chef that you'd like the chef's choice and give a price point and the chef will prepare you a meal of whatever they want to fit into your budget. It's different from an omakase since those include already prepped food. This was purely just fish. I was floored with the selection I ended up getting - the use of scallops and uni and tuna were amazing. The chef took time to explain to us each time he brought a new item to our plate.  The service here is exceptional and the food is amazing. If you ever want to throw down some dough and taste some mouth-watering sushi selection, I recommend this place a hundred times over."}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite Japanese restaurant in Toronto. Zen has the freshest fish for sushi and sashimi. We always order the omakase sashimi or sushi. Don't forget to leave room for the neki toro handroll which is wrapped and eaten immediately to ensure the seaweed does not get soggy. The mandarin orange cream pie is made by the senichi's wife and a delicious end to a great dinner."}
{"text":"My friend heard of this place and wanted to try for a long time so we decide to come and give it a go. It's a bit pricy but it's all the same when it comes to a nice sushi place. Overall was a great experience, presentation were nice but the freshness of the food is not what I expected. But the dessert save it all! The perfect combination and put me into a dessert coma. Worth to give it a try and I may come back for the dessert."}
{"text":"REALLY disappointed!! I use to always go to this place when they were at the other location. I went today, we waited 45 min when we had reservation then we realise they completely change the menu, boost the price by triple and remove salmon of the menu?? What a waist of time, not recommend to anybody"}
{"text":"Came here three times since my last review. Once I came here for take out lunch, and the other two times I got the omakase sushi for dinner. My peeve in my last review was that the omakase sushi did not include otoro. There was one piece that may have been chu-toro (medium toro) or maguro (can't remember anymore, hard to tell from my old pic).  The second time I got the omakase sushi, I was glad that it included one piece of otoro and one other piece of probably chu-toro (which was actually better than the one I had in my first review). The otoro was fatty, but wasn't as fatty as the one I had at jabistro or yasu. My dinner companion had the omakase sashimi, and she said that the Uni had a bit of a fishy taste. I found it odd because the Uni in my omakase sushi was fine, so I tasted hers--yes, the taste was a little bit off.  The third time, however, only included one chu-toro. No otoro.  In general, this place has some good quality sushi, but again I wouldn't call it the best (like most other reviewers here). One downside to the omakase sushi set that I don't know if otoro is going to be a part of my omakase sushi (meanwhile, I see many other yelpers with otoro + chutoro in their omakase sushi. What's up with that??) If I'm gonna spend 70 dollars (after tax and tip) on the omakase sushi set, I think otoro should be in there.  9/10 for quality, 7/10 for the value, 8/10 for the service. 8.5/10 stars overall (not an average)."}
{"text":"We have been going to Zen for a few years now and it remains our favourite sushi restaurant. The service is excellent, the fish is very fresh, and it never disappoints.   I give it 4.5 stars only because it is very hard to get a table unless you have reservations, and they don't have enough seating most days/nights. Overall a great, authentic Japanese restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had scoured yelp for the best authentic sushi up north and all signs pointed to Zen... until it didn't. The food was meh, and the experience was a bust.  For an upscale sushi restaurant, the sushi rice was SO dry. It made the rest of the sushi very hard to eat and ruined my omakase sushi set. They were also very stingy on the uni, I had a little tiny piece on the corner of my nigiri - the rest of the sushi was topped with cucumber slices (??).  It puzzles me why Zen would choose to offer omakase at the same price for those sitting at the sushi bar vs tables. The sushi bar customers get to watch the chef slice your fish, intricately decorate your sushi, and serve you plate by plate. Meanwhile, I sat at at table, longingly staring at the fun being had at the sushi bar while puzzled by which of my 12 nigiris were what on my giant plate.  Don't come here for omakase here unless you can get a seat at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"???????????????\"????\"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\"????\"?????? ?????????????\"all you can eat\"????????????????????"}
{"text":"Everything I have ever tried at Zen has just been too good to be true. I decided to try the steak , and continues to be impressed . Not too heavily marinated or spiced, you can truly taste the quality of the beef.  It came with salad and miso soup.. ..delicious and mouth watering."}
{"text":"My brother brought me here to celebrate my birthday, and apparently ruin every year after that. This place is amazing beyond all expectation.   The service is exceptionally friendly and professional. In fact, they overheard my brother and I speaking about my birthday and gave us a couple of special items as well as a heavenly mandarin pie at the end. I ate it, despite my dairy allergy. It was WORTH ALL THE PAIN.  The food is just transcendent. Every bite made put me through this emotional roller coaster of: Oh my god this is so good Why doesn't everything taste this good? WHY DOESN'T ANYTHING TASTE THIS GOOD? WHEN AM I GOING TO GET TO EAT THIS AGAIN? LOOK AT THE PRICE THIS IS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN AND I'LL BE EATING SUBPAR SUSHI FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.  It was a bit... a bit nuts. The omakase is completely worth it. The price is high, but you leave thinking that the value is excellent. Stop reading this. Just go.  Oh, and if you have friends who are not into sushi, they should maybe go somewhere else. This place is all about the sushi. Also, make a reservation. You'll need it. If you're planning on the omakase, eat at the bar.   Liquor license is pending."}
{"text":"We sat at the sushi bar and ordered the omakase sushi. The chef directly in front of us was not the one preparing our order. He was fulfilling the orders for the table seatings. The chef that prepared our food was standing far away from where we sit. Everytime he made one sushi to place at our plate at the bar, he would have to reach in front of the chef standing in front of us. It was just awkward. There were empty seats in front of that chef but they did not arrange us to be seated there to better serve us. And those seats were empty throughout the course of our meal. For the price we are paying, I would expect the service to be more thoughtful.   Overall, the food quality was great, not outstanding. The sushi we had were similar quality to the omakase we had at Jabistro. The service of the servers were not as attentive as I have expected. I have had better service at other Japanese restaurants with the same price point or lower.   For the price we paid I would say our experience was very underwhelming."}
{"text":"I went here for my mom's birthday dinner. I made a reservation but there was still a 30 minute wait. Additionally, the service wasn't that great. I have worked at a sushi restaurant before and I was expecting a bit more politeness, especially after the wait.   We got three sushi omakase sets. The food was great. The proportion between the sushi and rice was just right. The way they garnish their sushi is delicate and I enjoyed the meal.   I would say skip this place if you want a special night with good service!"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever! Make a reservation and sit at this bar. Order the omakase sushi and you won't be disappointed. Will definitely be returning for more. While the location isn't the best, the food, friendliness and attentiveness of the staff more than make up for it."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now, and each time has re-confirmed that this is one of the premier sushi houses in Toronto. You can knock the location and décor, but not the food, and that's what matters most. Here you find that fanatical attention to quality and detail that separates the great from the good. Fresh grated wasabi root instead of the stuff in a tube, tamari soy sauce instead of generic crud, brewed tea instead of tea bags, but first and foremost, the freshness, quality and deft hand in the preparation of the seafood. Each and every dish I have ordered has been first rate. The toro is just as unctuous, smooth and flavourful as it should be, the squid is perfectly cooked, each roll is a master class in balancing flavours, textures and colours so that each sense may feast on the artistry. For those looking for massive portions or heavily flavoured mall food, this place will disappoint with reasonable size portions of delicate, subtly flavoured dishes that showcase the fresh, light notes of quality seafood. Reservations are usually a must as most of the crowd in the know has this small gem on speed dial. Very highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This has now been my 4th or 5th omakase experience and my overall verdict is that it's just alright. I'm giving it a 3 star as an average of my 2/5 rating for value and 4/5 rating for quality of food.    Having experienced both the $85 omakase sushi as well as the $115 omakase sashimi course for 1, I definitely have a few cents to share with you. First of all, if you didn't already know, the difference between the two is that the cheaper option consists solely of chef's choice sushi while the more expensive option is like a combo that gives you a handful of appetizers and a dessert as well.  The \"sushi-only\" omakase was personally my preferred choice because it got down to the real reason why I was there - to have delicious high quality sushi. The fish variety was fresh and I was delighted by the overall portion sizes. Normally when I have 15-20 piece omakases, I'm not that full at the end but somehow, this 14 piece omakase was plenty filling.   However, the \"full-course\" omakase had its own merit as well and I'd actually recommend this one IF you fancy taking pictures of food or have an adventurous palate - that is, of course, if you have the means to dish out a few extra dolla bills on a more well-rounded meal. The 6 additional appetizers are interesting to say the least and really sensitizes your tastebuds. Some more savoury, some more sour, it's a nice blend of flavours and because they come in sampler portions, it makes you feel like you're a dainty princess/prince. For dessert, you also get 3 different dishes and although the ice cream was the only noteworthy one, it was absolutely delicious.   Unique to Zen, the two varieties of homemade ice cream - soy milk and hojicha were very tasty and I'd highly recommend you try it if you're an ice cream fanatic. In fact, we had ordered extras of them at the end of our meal despite their hefty $8/scoop price tag. I mean, was it worth the value? Not at all. But was it worth the experience? Definitely for a one-time thing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Definitely one of the best sushi restaurants I've been to, and so worth the price! My husband and I got the Omakase Sushi course, and the Omakase Sashimi course. Everything that was brought to our table tasted sooooo yummy. From the sashimi, to the sushi, to the hot food and the dessert. The fish is very fresh, and the selection that was offered to us that day was great. As part of the sushi course, I also got a tuna hand roll. This is honestly the best hand roll I've ever had in my life. The seaweed was super crispy, and the diced up tuna was amazing. It was so good, that we just had to ordered another one on top of our set course. The set sushi didn't come with a squid sushi, which is one of my husband's favourite fish, so we ordered that too. Sooooo good. I love Japanese steamed egg, and was really glad that it was one of the appetizers that came with the set course. The steamed egg here was also the best I've ever had. Honestly, everything was amazing. I can't wait to come again!  Service is also great, the waitresses are very attentive. Always ensuring that your water/tea is never empty. Every dish that is brought out is carefully explained.  Make sure you call to make reservations!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to celebrate my wife's birthday.   The staff was really friendly.   We ordered the sushi kaiseki (tasting menu).  To start we had a light soup which was delicious and full of flavour.   It had a seared scallop and Chinese mushroom.  Throughout the meal we had fresh sashimi, very refreshing , steamed egg in truffle oil, a nice piece of wagyu steak (wife felt to fatty, mine was delicious and was so tasty), Hand rolls, and a very good lobster tempura.   The batter was very well done and presentation was amazing  Dessert was good, with everything made in house.   My wife really liked the home made soy milk ice cream."}
{"text":"Good location in markham! Clean, Japanese modern decor. Steep prices for their set menus. Have hAd better omakase at lower price point. However if you are willing to spend a little more this is a great option for good quality Japanese food!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant through Yelp reviews while in the Toronto area. My family, boyfriend and I were on a roadtrip in celebration of my brother's graduation at U of M. My brother was craving sushi and it was late so we decided to check out Zen Japanese sushi. This place is definitely a hole in the wall restaurant with real Japanese sushi chefs and waitresses. We don't typically have that here in Houston, TX although it's one of the biggest cities in the USA.  Now on to the food....we ordered Nabeyaki and Niku udon and I must say that the tempura was crispy and the red meat was thinly sliced and flavorful. The soup base was delicious! Then we ordered the Tokujyo Zushi and all the fish pieces melted in our mouths. My mom ordered the Sashimi main dish and I tried the Octopus which was  tender and not rubbery.   Also, we had an order of Uni which was exceptionally sweet and the perfect texture. I was slightly disappointed in a custom order of spicy chopped scallop handroll since I was expecting a spicy mayo base as I've always ordered from other sushi restaurants. However, the scallops in the handroll maintained its' natural flavors and was still very tasty.   I wish I can move Zen to Houston or at least trigger sushi chefs to come to Houston and open a restaurant with exceptional service and quality fish like Zen."}
{"text":"It is the best sushi/sashimi here so far in Toronto! The chef's choice sashimi and sushi are to die for. Believe it or not even the Miso soup is amazing, they use real fish stock and I could taste the difference right away. This place is know for their sushi rice.  I was glad to see that salmon wasn't even served since it is so common here in Canada. The chef took his time to explain where each piece came from and many of which came straight from japan. Amazing marbled tuna, uni, roe, seawater eel etc.  YOU MUST sit at the sushi bar to get the real experience! Eating each piece one by one really made me savor the flavor even more.I loved it so much, we even ordered all the sushi on the OFF menu, which were amazing.  It is really affordable if you are comparing it to other a la carte, I much prefer Zen over my friend's recommendations of Shinobu downtown.  If you really want a taste of Japan, go here! Not gonna lie, I over spent there cause it was THAT good. My boyfriend and I ended up dropping $250, because we just kept ordering extra sushi. Other than that, to get the Chef's choice sushi/sashimi is only $45 each person plus tax. Quality over Quantity- say no to ayce  ps. don't forget to order the Spider Roll! An entire soft shell crab is in there =)"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Zen for many years in the Scarborough location, and I have always love the sushi there and particularly the Omakase sushi when seating at the sushi bar.  I have just been there again at the new woodbine location and would like to write a review now that I am a \"yelper\" too. I guess this review here is really to reconfirm again their sushi is still as good as before, even after they have moved recently. It's true that the menu has changed alot in the new place and the many a la Carte that many used to enjoyed are no longer being offered. But for me, I always go to Zen for Sushi only so this change doesn't impact me at all (I am sure it may have to other customers).  For the Omakase Sushi menu, they offered two pricing menus, $65 and $85. With $85, you get extra fish soup (or other soup the kitchen may offer for the day), appetizer, and dessert. I think it's well worth the extra $20 to get those extra 3 items. I have tried the Omakase twice ($85) since they moved to this new location and the Sushi being served is great! I would always prefer eating at the Sushi bar because the experience is also different, for example, the seaweed is still crunchy when the piece of sushi is served on your plate and eat it immediately ... it's minor in details but it can make a difference at times.   -- edited: section removed as a reviewer corrected me on type of fish, thx for the correction! :) --  But you don't have to pick the Omakase menu if you don't want to and you can always order the sushi separately and they will charge you the sushi by order. But for me, I just pick the Omakase so I dont need to do any thinking in picking what I want.  The service is also excellent where the service staffs are attentive and caring!"}
{"text":"I'm not a new customer to Zen. I have been to their dinner and lunch before. The quality of fish and sushi here has always been superb.   However, my recent dinner experience at Zen has been disappointing. I ordered the omakase sushi dinner for one, which includes a Wagyu beef with eggplant, an assortment of appetizers ( steamed egg, walnut salad, a small pieces of fish, octopus and duck), noodles in bonito soup, 13 pieces of sushi, and dessert.    The wagyu beef was nice and eggplant were cooked quite well. However this dish was a bit salty for my taste.   The assortment of appetizers were ok. It wasn't bad but also nothing too outstanding.   The noodles in soup was a bit salty again. However the noodles were cooked well and there was a hint of yazu zest on top which was a surprise.   The sushi was disappointing. The fish wasn't as fresh  as I've had it before. The salmon lacks their sweet fatty fish flavor. Fatty toro wasn't fatty at all. And WAY too much wasabi. The wasabi completely covered the subtle freshness of the fish taste. Horrible. Just horrible. The better sushi was the scallops and the eel. The complete disaster sushi was the shrimp and mackerel. Did I mention too much wasabi?!?! How can they mess up such fundamental skill?   Dessert was Home made. Soy milk ice cream was excellent. Perfect pairing with the matcha cookie.   Shiso sherbet was minty and refreshing. This is a big bowl of sherbet. ($8) Share with a friend.   Service is outstanding. Cup is never less than half empty.   In conclusion, unlikely to return for dinner. This meal cost over $100. I feel at that price point, there are other options. Lunch, on the contrary, is still not a bad option when you crave fresh fish a cut above the regular sushi joint."}
{"text":"What an experience! We came here with a party of 7 for their lunch omakase and were not disappointed. The service was attentive in refilling our green tea and our group thoroughly enjoyed the banter with the sushi chefs. The sushi itself was fresh and very flavorful. While they were all delicious, the handroll, uni, kampachi, otoro really stood out. The seaweed they use is a high quality crunchy seaweed that melts in your mouth. Their ice cream is also amazing. I've never been so satisfied with such a small portion of ice cream! Would love to come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Zen is one of the best Japanese restaurants in Toronto. It serves authentic Japanese food. The service is friendly and attentive. For a truly unique experience, try getting a sit at the sushi bar and order the omakase. You get to interact with the sushi chefs as they prepare your sushi one by one.   The $80 omakase will get you 13 pieces of premium sushi and a chopped otoro hand roll. The ingredients were fresh and the sushi were expertly prepared. In addition to the 13 pieces of sushi, I ordered two additional pieces that were \"off the menu\" - made with fishes that I have never heard of. I also ordered a small udon and a chirashi bowl to finish. The food was exceptional.  While Zen is located in a strip mall in Markham, the interior is modern. I enjoyed sitting at the sushi bar and watching the chefs at work. The prices are a bit high, but the ingredients are fresh.  I would highly recommend Zen."}
{"text":"Zen is very authentic japanese restaurant which is well known among the sushi lovers in toronto for it's authenticity and it's fresh cuts of fish. It is located in the most unlikely of places for a above average sushi/japanese restaurant as it neighbours a strip bar and a galaxy bowling alley!! Don't got expecting the atmosphere of Ki downtown let's just say-this place puts out sincere, well prepared japanese-the aesthetics are secondary!  I went here with a group of people for a meet up once and they staff were all very accomadating to our healthy appetites given that most of us ordered the sushi omakase and then some. The sushi was very fresh and cut well and the grilled fish we had at the start was grilled well and lightly spiced. I loved the special tuna maki roll we had towards the end of the meal something about the nori was spot on and it seemed that it was toasted beforehand. Also for dessert they have seasame black bean ice cream!!-a sublime sweet ending."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a month and it's always a great time. The environment here is very modern. If it's your first time here I suggest to you to call ahead and make reservations for the sushi bar. Omakase meals ($80-160) tend to take roughly 2 hours, so make sure you don't have plans right after.   Some appetizers I recommend from here are gindara saikyo yaki (grilled miso flavor black cod) - $16, gindara kama nitsuke (simmered black cod neck) - $12.50 and the soft shell crab $15. My favourite sushi here probably has to be Japanese uni, roughly $40 for two pieces, depending on the market price, you can definitely taste the difference between the two. If you don't plan on splurging on the a la carte menu, their scallop from Japan and o-toro are pretty good as well, they are often included in the omakase meal as well. I also recommend you getting the tea instead of water because it goes extremely well with the fish.    Service here is kinda of slow, not that attentive, especially when it came to tea/water refills. After coming here for nearly a year now, I noticed that both service and food has drastically declined. To my surprise, the uni (from New York) I had today, did not taste fresh at all. In fact in had an awful smell to it and tasted fishy, felt kind of embarrassed that they even served it. Overall, this was once my go to omakase restaurant but I'm quite disappointed with them now. Still a place I would recommend trying out if you never tried it here."}
{"text":"I have dined at the original Zen location in Scarborough and was excited to hear about their move and the push to even more authenticity in the cuisine.  I finally got to try the Markham location (give them a year to iron out any bugs...) and was very impressed.  Gone are the bento boxes and gaijin McSushi Rolls (in Markham, walk 10 metres in any direction and you'll find those), instead is a much smaller menu of totally authentic Japanese dishes. It appears Zen is taking a page out of the Sushi Kaji playbook, by offering a curiously similar Kaiseki dinner for $135 (I'll definitely return and try it).    I went with the $65 Omakase Sushi, and if you want to order this, make sure to reserve a spot at the bar. At the previous location the bar was much smaller so I would have this at a table, which meant they would make all the sushi pieces, assemble them on a plate, and deliver them all at once.  At the bar each piece will be served immediately after it's been made, as it should be.  You will not need to dunk sushi in soy sauces (which you do at the tables) since the chef brushes on the right amount of sauce on each piece before delivery.  A more impressive touch, for some pieces, after brushing on the sauce, a very light dusting of lemon rind (finely grated) was added, the acidity from the lemon oil helping the vinegary rice and the soy sauce balance out the fish.  Also, each piece was seasoned which just enough wasabi. Again, all about balance. Just eat each piece at once, then take a small slice of pickled ginger for a palate cleanser, then await the next piece.  Omakase sushi at its authentic best.  No mixing up nasty Yoda sauce here.  My dining partner (who is not a fan of raw fish) went with three cooked dishes from the appetizer menu, the tempura, kuro-ton (breaded pork cutlet), gindara saikyo (black cod with miso).  I sampled some of these and found them to be excellent.  If you've had these at Chinese run AYCE places, there's no comparison.  This will amaze you.   Even though they no longer offer the gaijin dishes (see above) members of your party who don't like real sushi will not be disappointed.  This was one of the complaints I read here soon after the move to Markham, and it appears they boosted the cooked apps selection to satisfy such diners without having to sell out to the Chinese Monster Truck McSushi-rolls/teppanyaki/bento/AYCE crowd.  This was a pleasant surprise for my partner who did not go in with a positive expectation but left satisfied.  There's no longer a need to travel to a seedy part of Scarborough or all the way to the wilds of Etobicoke (or pay a small fortune at Hashimoto) for an amazing, authentic Japanese dinner.  Take your gaijin friends and family here to show them what real Japanese food is about.  One meal at Zen and hopefully they won't crave McRolls, Benihana, or the latest Groupon deal anymore."}
{"text":"A gem in Markham. Authentic Japanese Omakase style lunch/dinner or blind tasting at the sushi bar. Feels like your back in Japan as their sushi fish is flown in weekly every Saturday, Tuesday and Wednesday straight from Japan. And so is their special Wagyu beef. Something to die for and extremely tasty. Quality over quantity in this low key Japanese restaurant that's comfortable and far from pretentious like most high-end over priced restaurants in downtown. This place is nothing like that. It's so comfortable the staff are very friendly and well mannered and offer an easy explanation for each course/dish. It's comforting yet presented like a beautiful piece of art work. Each dish is highly thoughtful and decorated like a Japanese painting. And the dishes are such high quality. I highly recommend the sake tasting if you like to sip. Go with the cold sake instead of hot as it gives a refreshing taste to the palette after each bite of sushi. If you want to come with a group of more then 4 people, please do make a reservation at least 5 days in advanced because it's a small intimate place and sometimes hard to get the time you want for dinner. Do arrive early as it messes up other people's reservations if you arrive late. Like I said, the place is small and you really need to make a reservation for dinners. Great for a date night and also great for a family gathering."}
{"text":"Get the omakase. For omakase this place is 5 star. The service is top notch and they only use the best fish from all around. Highly recommend lunch as the fish was very fresh. Great O-toro and sea urchin."}
{"text":"First impression: when I walked into Zen, I felt the authentic atmosphere as I heard the chefs and waitresses speaking Japanese. They were also all very friendly and welcomed us as we took our seats by the sushi bar. As a side note, you should call in advance to make a reservation if you want to sit at the sushi bar.  The main menu consisted of a limited selection of only 5 courses to choose from. We each ordered the Omakase Sushi, which came with miso soup, 13 pieces of sushi, and a handroll. We watched as our chef made each piece of sushi, and his knife skills were phenomenal. I liked how the chef described what each of the fish were as he served each piece of sushi to us, so I knew what I was putting in my mouth! As a heads up (for those who don't eat wasabi like me), they put a bit of wasabi in every piece of sushi, but it wasn't overwhelming, so it still tasted good. They also grind lemon and brush soy sauce on the fish before serving it.  Compared to uni that I ate at another sushi restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of an unpleasant aftertaste after eating the uni sushi at Zen, which shows how fresh their seafood is. The handroll was the last piece of the night, stuffed with tuna belly. According to the chef, the tuna belly is stored in a freezer of minus 50 degrees Celsius, to maintain its freshness and so that it wouldn't change colour! He advised us to eat it as soon as it was made to get the full taste. The seaweed was extremely crispy, so you don't need to bite on it forever to break it apart. The tuna belly melts in your mouth, and the onions mixed in with it added a subtle refreshing taste to it.  Overall, the service was great and the food was delicious! I will definitely be back to try their Omakase Sashimi. :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I were ecstatic when we heard that Zen was moving  to Markham - especially when the original location was in Scarborough and it was a bit far from where we lived. We decided to drop-by on a Friday night to see if there were any seats available and to our surprise, they were already fully booked for the day when we arrived at around 5:30! Consequently, we decided to make bookings for dinner 2 weeks later and decided to wait it out. Definitely make sure you reserve your seats beforehand as there's probably no chance for you to grab any seats without a reservation. Unfortunately, we were not informed you also had to tell them when making your reservations that you want seats in front of the sushi bar.   Both of us had the omakase sushi dinner. The total including taxes and tips was around $80 and both of us agreed that it was definitely not worth it. Both of us left un-impressed and ended up going to Cha Me Cha for food as the dinner was definitely not enough to full someone up. Maybe it's a personal issue but I do not like wasabi at ALL on my sushi. The amount of wasabi within the pieces was absurd and made the sushi hard to gulp down. Perhaps this should have been communicated early and was the norm in a lot of these high-class sushi places....In my opinion, the fish itself wasn't the most fresh I've had - I've ate MUCH better sushi for lower prices elsewhere.  Zen was a huge letdown because I've heard so many rave reviews about this place and as a huge sushi fanatic, I had really high expectations for Zen especially since i've heard it's on-par with Jabistro. I will not be returning to Zen."}
{"text":"4.5  Located in an inconspicuous plaza that can be easily overlooked is one of the most expensive Japanese establishments around. Came here for my birthday to try the Sushi Kaiseki ($135 per person) which consists of 8 courses and I was not disappointed.   Tamago Tofu (Egg Tofu with Lobster) - A cold dish to kick off the meal and cleanse the palate. The tofu was soft and creamy giving an interesting contrast to the texture of the bamboo shoot. The lobster tempura was meaty and worked really well with the sauce. Great start.  Zensai (Assorted Appetizers) - Lots of variety with this one. I cant remember the specifics of each item but I enjoyed every one. The mini octopus with sesame paste, the jello with shrimp, enoki mushrooms, squid etc. inside and the rare duck breast were a wonderful, welcomed challenge to my taste buds. The veggies and mushroom were solid as well.   Hotate & Nyumen - This was the least memorable dish both in presentation and delicacy. The broth was absolutely delicious but the noodles were just regular well-made thin noodles and the scallop tempura was no longer crispy by the time it was served (is this normal?). A little underwhelming.  Sashimi Moriawase (Chef's Special Choice Sashimi) - Sashimi is phenomenal. The fish is SO fresh, it's insane. I couldn't get over how pure it tasted. I have to admit the quality surpasses that of Yasu. My favorite was the amberjack and I was glad that the uni didn't have an ocean smell to it. This was bomb.   Gindara Yuan Yaki (Grilled Black Cod, marinated with Yuzu & Sake) - I'm drooling thinking about the cod. Absolute perfection. It came with a myrica rubra/yamimomo fruit that complemented the rest of the dish so well, it blew my mind. The fruit was sweet and such a delight. This can be ordered a la carte and I would highly recommend it!   Wagyu Shabu Shabu (A4 Wagyu) - I was looking forward to this the most. The beef was so tender, dissolving in my mouth (as it should). The wagyu may not have been top of the line but the quality and marbling was superb nonetheless. I savored every moment of it! It is served with some veggies but they were so thinly sliced that when you dip it into the broth, it shrivels up to become more miniscule and hard to taste. I didn't really care and was too occupied with the beef anyway!   Omakase Sushi (Chef's Special Choice Sushi) - I had to take a half star off because I felt the nigiri was a little disappointing. The fish was amazing but the sushi rice kept breaking which is something that shouldn't be happening for a place of this calibre. It's unacceptable, really. There were also a few pieces where the wasabi was way too strong. This overpowered the taste of the fish and really took away my enjoyment of eating it.   Toro Handroll - Best handroll ever although it didn't look too appetizing. The seaweed was so crispy and we were told to eat it as soon as possible to get the full taste. Outstanding. I came to realize handrolls in a cylindrical shape taste better than the typical cone-shaped ones (the prettier version) because the fish to rice ratio is more even this way. I was able to taste the fish in every bite.    Homemade Dessert - Black seasame icecream with a traditional Japanese biscuit, strawberry red bean mochi and a macaron-like dessert with red bean and green tea ice cream filling, served with brown sugar on the side. I loved every single one. The matcha icecream was an emerald green and strong in flavor just how I like it. Yum.  I was stuffed by the end of the meal. Service was pleasant. Their English isn't the greatest so I had to really listen to their explanations of each dish. Very attentive and friendly overall.   I personally wouldn't do omakase here (I prefer Yasu for the intimate experience and the reasonable pricing in comparison) but a la carte or the kaiseki is worth a try. Zen was excellent and one of the most memorable meals I've ever had! Come here for a special occasion and you won't regret."}
{"text":"Made the trek out of Scarberia for 'the best sushi in Toronto'.  Best sushi in Toronto, not even close.  We had: agedashi tofu - I didn't eat any but my friends liked it Clear fish soup - interesting with lemon rind and onions in it, but the broth was too mild Black cod - totally greasy and fishy. Ick. Maguro sushi - eh. The fish was nice, but no better than at other (high end) place Futomaki - cucumber instead of avocado? Thumbs down My friend had the chirashi which she liked My other friend had spicy tuna - she gave me a piece and I almost had to spit it out because it tasted awful,,,and I mean awful.  Spider roll - mayonnaise globbed all over it We had the mandarin pie which was disgusting and gelatinous - why anyone would eat such a thing I have no idea.   Oh and they didn't have white tuna, either. FAIL! No albacore!  Um. No. I'll stick with my usual refrain. Japango is the best sushi in Toronto."}
{"text":"Always absolutely perfect. Best sushi east of the DVP. In the ranks of Hiro, Nami and Omi."}
{"text":"A Japanese restaurant in a sketchy Scarborough strip mall right next to a \"massage\" parlour and a stones through from a strip club, \"Why would you go there?\" one might think. Well you should come here because just like the massage parlour next door, Zen will make sure you get a happy ending.   I recently came here for lunch on a weekday with a fellow yelper. The place is quite cozy consisting of a few tables, a sushi bar, and a couple of booths. The place was rather full for lunch with people likely taking advantage of their many lunch specials. Their lunch menu is about 2 pages of specials ranging from sashimi to your basic chicken teriyaki. On this day I opted for the assorted sushi and sashimi lunch special (I don't remember the exact price but it was around $16).   My lunch special came with a few pieces of sashimi, sushi and a couple pieces of maki, plus a small bowl of miso soup. The miso soup was quite nice, not too salty it was a good start to lunch. My lunch arrived shortly after my soup and it was very nicely presented. The sashimi was immaculate and very fresh. My favourite of the sashimi was the salmon belly which was a little fatty and practically melted in my mouth, the red tuna was a close second. The Sushi pieces were also very fresh, I enjoyed trying a single piece of a few varieties of fish rather than your standard salmon and tuna only. The only disappointing part of the meal was the maki rolls which were just ok. The rolls included were very simple, small pieces that I could probably get at any sushi restaurant around.   The service was excellent; our waitress constantly checked up on us and was always asking if we wanted more tea. Overall Zen is one of the better Japanese restaurants that I have been to, I will definitely be back for more lunch specials but I don't know if I want to be walking around this area at night so I might opt to skip dinner here."}
{"text":"How do you give this restaurant a 5 star???? Considering a 5 star restaurant the atmosphere, service, food, pricing and recover of wrong doing.        The atmosphere is a 2 star. I felt very uncomfortable sitting 1 and half foot away from the other table. The lighting was dull and the open kitchen was no show at all.  The service was good which I will give it a 4 star. Waitress was very polite.  The food for the name 'Zen' is a 1 star to me. The miso soup was poor. The sake was not even hot. The sashimi was a joke! My wife couldn't even eat one of them because it was chewy. The tiny scallop they gave was a joke. The quality of these sashimi I can get it anywhere.  The price for what they give should be a $$.  Now that I told the manager that the food was very poor they offered me a desert. I'm not there for their dessert. I didn't accept it. They gave me a 10% discount for next visit. Do you think I'll come again???."}
{"text":"This place is my all time favorite japanese restaurant in the GTA now. The fish is super fresh, and the uni is soo delicious! I've been here twice now and ordered the sushi omakase. its definitely one of those unique hidden spots that doesn't border pretentiousness whatsoever. The area does seem a little sketchy, but its worth the trek there. The staff is super friendly and they definitely know what their doing. I suggest eating at the bar to get a better experience :)"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a table seat. Got there and waited literally 43 minutes for our Omakase sushi plates (13 pieces) to arrive. 30 minutes in, I asked for the reason of the delay and got a response of \"they're working on it\". By this point, we're already tipsy after having finished 2 bottles of sake while waiting.  Once the sushi arrived, we were so hungry that the entire plate was devoured within 10 minutes. All I can remember was that the toro was pretty good, but the rest were just there to satisfy my hunger.  I came here to try and compare the sushi quality and overall experience to the likes of Yasu and Kaji, but clearly those restaurants are very much on a different level. On our way out, we also saw a sketchy dude walking into the happy-ending massage parlour next door...  Will not return."}
{"text":"I always loved this place when it was a hidden gem in a run down strip. The sushi is still good here but it doesn't feel as homely and authentic as before...overrun by the uptown crowd now. Hoping to discover and enjoy another hidden sushi gem before it gets ruined by these so called \"foodies\"."}
{"text":"Having been to most hot-topic Omakase restaurants in Toronto, I honestly expected Zen's uptown location to fall slightly short of the more glamorous places in the Downtown core.  However, I was proved wrong with the Omakase Sushi Course. Not only does Zen have more courses than similar restaurants, the freshness of the sushi and creativity of the non-sushi courses were top notch.  An integral part of a quality Omakase experience is the small talk that the sushi chefs offer. At Zen the head chef as well as most of the waitresses spoke Japanese with my parents and took the extra time to explain every item that came out.  Zen was amazing and I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I came blindfolded and didn't know what to expect and this place blew me away.  - make reservation for omakase at the sushi bar for the ultimate experience  The sign on the establishment is located at the very left side and its pretty small that I almost missed it. When you walk in, you'll sense the change in atmosphere and it's unspoken etiquette. It's pretty quiet as if you're walking through a temple or a peace garden, I guess they constructed the walkway to calm yourself before entering the dinning room.   I highly recommend to sit at the sushi bar for a fun experience. You'll be entertained by the epic skills of the sushi chefs and the drool worthy seafood.  WARNING: It could also be a distraction from your guest since you might not be able to take your eyes off the the food :P Also, it'll make you want to order more because it's just so tempting when you see the chef making their next sushi concoction. (so guilty, we ordered another special concoction handroll and almost ordered more a la carte items ^^;)   We ordered the sushi omakase that came with 3 appetizers, lobster tempera noodle soup, 15 pieces of sushi and two types of dessert. Started off the meal with hot Kinmon sake that had a nice fragrant smell to it and was on the sweeter side. They also provide warm wet napkins before you start your meal, so you can eat the sushi the authentic way (with your hands).  I will definitely order from the a la carte next time since I got a taste from the course meal. Service was great; the servers were knowledgeable about the dishes and were polite."}
{"text":"amazing service, very very friendly staff and chefs, the sushi is amazingly fresh and great attention to detail. make sure you sit at the Chef's bar. can't have sushi any other way after this experience."}
{"text":"Dined here 3x since their move to their Markham location. Overall, still one of the finest Japanese restaurants in Toronto. They have improved every time I've been back and I look forward to further improvements. One of their main chefs (Jacky) left with the closure of their Scarborough location, so in time I trust his replacement will be as good.  Prices, especially for the omakase, have gone up significantly! Boarderline unjustified, but I understand the market they now serve can easily afford it and Zen for the most part is still in a league of its own.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I entered a restaurant which has a traditional Japanese CURTAIN entrance so it's almost assumed from that starting point on that expectations should be held somewhat high.   As I went in 2:00 pm Wed I saw the last 2 patrons head out, so I had the whole restaurant all by myself. At least that's what I thought but it seemed that the FAMILY of this Japanese family-run joint takes the enjoyment of the restaurant too as they walk around doing miscellaneous things such as the owner/man ask the young lady about WIFI and stuff for his smartphone. Chat as a family in full Japanese, that's how I know they're all Japanese.   I was thinking to sit anywhere I wish but the young lady sat me at a spot that hides from the SUSHI counter so I had limited vision. Ordering the Nigiri Special 9-piece ($15.95), even though I couldn't see much of the preparation I was able to hear my food being prepare as I heard a DING. That most likely meant my Unagi Nigiri was ready!   The 9-pieces were fairly nicely prepared and presented however maybe a piece or 2 was over done on the wasabi portion. That was because they do not provide WASABI on the side for you, so that the Chef gives you the taste that they wish you to have.   As the Apprentice or Sous-Chef prepped, that's because the Owner/Chef was lurking in front of me using his smartphone and looking at the receipts for the lunch-period. The fish did not have any FROZEN taste that most other Japanese restaurants will offer. I also like how I was given a ROUND sauce dish rather than those non-traditional rectangular plastic imitators.   I was seated facing the INTERESTING register booth/table that had so much stuff there that it took away some of the beautifully decorated setting of this dining room. Maybe they should consider decluttering it or moving it elsewhere, but where I have no clue because that spot cannot accommodate much else.   I had the Salad which was A-OK as I later on went to Heisei @ J-Town and think I found the Salad Dressing they were using. It probably had Eggs, Soya Sauce, Sesame, Oil, Vinegar, etc...   I didn't rate 4 *Stars* because I felt it wasn't the experience I was looking for, it's actually a bit hard to explain. I mean, the server did all that she was suppose to and even refilled the Tea for me. I gave ZEN 3.5 *Stars* at this point-in-time looking forward to try their Chirashi."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant based on its rating and the positive comments regarding the food quality. I can't criticize the food quality they did have some quality sushi pieces.  The only reason I would give this restaurant a (***) is based on value, the confusing menu and as one reviewer said I'm not convinced that spending $100 at lunch for two people is for me. However they were busy and it seems they have a regular clientele. So if they can run a business charging those prices, then I wish them continued success."}
{"text":"The boyfriend brought me here for my birthday dinner and it did not disappoint :) it was pricey but it was really delicious! Our dinner was $330 before tip.  We had reservations for the sushi bar which is highly recommended! It's so entertaining to watch the chefs prepare sushi and sashimi. Piece by piece they were given to us.   We tried the Kaiseki (tasting menu). The most memorable was the wagyu beef hot pot which was so delicious and melts in your mouth. It was fascinating to see the hot pot which continues to burn until close to the end of you finishing up. Of course the sashimi, sushi and the hand roll was also phenomenal.   I wasn't expecting to be stuffed since higher end restos usually give smaller portions. At Zen, I was too stuffed! Unfortunately had to give some of my dishes to the BF to finish up :)   Would come back again."}
{"text":"This is an authentic Japanese restaurant. Immediately on arrival the feeling is quite different from your typical Japanese restaurant. You walk down a corridor beside a lighted pathway of pebbles stones and feel the atmosphere change as you enter. You are greeted by a professional hostess in a suit. Very Japanese. Your dinner reservation is treated seriously. Inside the restaurant the theme is minimalism. The sushi bar is unlike any other it is all open with plenty of room for several chefs to prepare the fish. It was a busy Saturday night in the restaurant. We had to wait approximately 10 min before the hostess came back to explain the menu. We ordered the sashimi omakase for one, sushi course for one and suki-nabe beef hotpot. The 3-4 appetizers were tasty  and left you wanting more. These are premade and brought out mostly to everyone who also orders the omakase. The chawan mushi was very smooth. The beef hot pot was small and there were no accompaniments. There was one large piece of hida gyu beef and a few roots and noodles. It felt like an appetizer. The portion is for one person. For $60 I expected some vegetables and at least a bowl of rice. Next came the sashimi and sushi which are variations of the same fish. This included Scottish trout, Halifax tuna, scallop and uni from Japan, sea bream, red snapper, fluke, toro, horse mackerel, anago eel. I'm probably missing a few. The fish was very fresh. Presentation was artful. Service was excellent. They try to explain all the dishes in detail for you to complete the experience. Dessert was also a mix of different things like the appetizers. Coffee jello, soybean milk ice cream and mochi. We also ordered the black sesame ice cream. This was pre scooped which I didn't expect. The ice cream tasted frozen and not very smooth. Overall an expensive authentic Japanese restaurant. The only things I noticed were: There is very little variation and options available on the menu and the pre made appetizers and desserts make it feel too structured and a bit cafeteria style. It is also very expensive. For two adults and a young child we spent $360. Likely a place that one would go for a special occasion but at the same time it is a small place, tables right next to each other and not a fancy restaurant. There are lots of other options in Toronto."}
{"text":"Brought the gf here a few days ago for her bday. We concluded that it was good but did not have the \"wow\" factor that we experienced at Yasu.  We both got the Sushi Omakase Course for One.   Tbh, the appetizers weren't that great - sure they're made of complex ingredients, but they did not deliver. The noodles tasted like noodles, the chicken broth thing in the cup tasted like a chicken broth thing in a cup. The only standout was the duck sashimi.   The sushi was pretty good, but I still think the fish at Yasu was better. Also, worth noting is that the sushi chefs include a generous portion of wasabi already in the sushi before placing it in front of you, so be sure to let them know if you want less or none at all. I really liked the special toro handroll the chef made at the end.  The dessert was satisfactory. I only got the mochi and a slice or the \"Crown Melon\". Spoiler alert - the Crown Melon tastes like cantaloupe. They even place a pamphlet in front of you with the Crown Melon to tell you that this fruit was served to Queen Elizabeth II and the Japanese imperial family to make you feel special. I'd much rather have had the tofu/soy/sesame ice cream.  In terms of atmosphere, it was fairly loud. Also, I preferred the pacing at Yasu better. The service, itself, was pretty good I must admit - the servers were on the ball with tea refills.  I regret having to write such a somber review for Zen, I really wanted to like it. I hope that they will improve in the areas I've described. Until then, reach Yasu for all of your omakase needs."}
{"text":"I really do not get all the hype about this place.  My dh said he has had better sushi. I do not eat the stuff.  I had the steak and it was so tough I could not eat it. No way it was AAA as noted on the menu. Would not bother going back."}
{"text":"I'm going to give Zen a 4 out of 5 based on dining experience, price point and food quality.  The location is obscure as the signage is poor, but when you do locate the restaurant it is gorgeous inside and very modern.  A great upgrade from their old location in Scarborough.  I got the omakase sushi dinner and it was absolutely divine but at $85 a bit steep.  You get an appetizer to start and it was great.      You get an egg soup dish that had seafood and meat mixed in which surprisingly was delicious.  The sushi dinner was absolutely fresh and all the fish melted in your mouth.  The Uni was to die for and some of their fish is imported from Japan.  I did scallop sashimi which was so tender and the flavour exceptional.  The negetoro roll was so tender and you could taste all the flavours that just came together nicely.  Last we got some desserts that consisted of a strawberry and mango with jelly and their soy milk ice cream with red beans.  Personally the desserts are probably an acquired taste but presentation was beautiful and unique.   The dining experience was excellent and the only reason I didn't give it a 5 out of 5 was because of the price point.  Just be sure to budget at LEAST $100 per person for dinner."}
{"text":"Was brought here by my gf to celebrate my own b-day. Service was great considering we forgot to reserve. The place is very peaceful and zen like. Not as loud as some other japanese places. You get lots of one on one time with the chef. I don't remember the name of the chef who served us but he was very friendly and took his time to explain each item to us.   I haven't tried anything outside of the Omakase but I remember looking at the menu and not really seeing much else that interested me. Also for the price I think I may get more premium pieces at another Omakase experience that I've tried. The fish was fresh and tasty but the selection wasn't as \"premium\" as some others. Maybe the fish selection was limited that day. I will come back to try again in the future and update the review.   Zen is definitely my fav pricey sushi place uptown."}
{"text":"The best salmon hand rolls I've ever had in my life. They weave the wasabi in. The tempura soba soup is fantastic. My favourite dessert is fruit with black beans. The Mandarin Orange pie is divine. You need reservations, this tiny place is booked every day they are open.  EDIT I went to their new location in Markham, and it's a different set up now. They offer only omikase and not a la carte. The oddest part was when they told us they ran out of salmon! We were in at 5:30 when they open - and somehow they ran out? You also have to book a reservation as you can't just drop in, they are always booked. The food was yummy but the menu didn't have the options I mentioned above. The uni was super yummy, as was this soft black cod in a broth (so sweet and soft). But I was thrown off by the new menu, and the lack of salmon. It discouraged me enough to consider not coming back. A disappointment for sure."}
{"text":"Would definitely give it 5 stars if they were the same restaurant when they were in Scarborough.  Sushi quality is still phenomenal. Definitely one of the three best sushi places in Toronto.  Their regular omakase sushi is still the best deal for great tasting fish/selection at a good price.  What is unfortunate is that they've gone high-end, and no longer has their regular dinner menu, and no longer serving lunch. We're still going, but only for special occasions."}
{"text":"Had the omakase sashimi dinner. At $75 for 20 pcs sashimi and a miso soup, it is a little overpriced. We also ended up ordering other dishes on the side, which jacked up the final cost by quite a bit more. The sashimi at Zen was very good, but the soft shell crab and tempura were mediocre. The beef tongue was quite nice though.   I found that the menu selection here is very small. I don't expect to see 50 different kinds of westernized maki that you can get at your typical AYCE restaurant, but would be nice to see things like chirashi and maybe some other appetizer dishes like takoyaki or okonomiyaki.   This new Woodbine Zen location is much nicer than the older one, and the food quality is excellent as usual. Great service and enjoyed dinner very much, but after paying $100+/person, I was still hungry. Ended up getting a $8 chicken on rice combo from another restaurant on the way home to fill me up. Would bump up the stars if menu selection is expanded and portions are increased. Understand that good quality fish is expensive, so offer some other filler dishes so I don't leave hungry after emptying my wallet here."}
{"text":"I haven't given 5 star reviews in a long time. But this Japanese restaurant for sure deserves 5+ stars!!! If u come U must sit at the bar and order the omakase. It's the best sushi I've had in Toronto. It's by far the freshest and the sushi chef is superb. It's a little pricey but U pay for what U get. It's the framing best!!! He sushi chef noticed I didn't like one of the sushi and gave it to my friend so he offered to give me another piece of my choosing of sushi.   It's an old jap restaurant but they are moving in April to uptown soon. Hope the level of food continues to stay as good.   I would def come back here to eat amazing melt in your mouth sushi"}
{"text":"This food has blown my mind! You haven't really experienced sushi until you've eaten here or in top places in Japan. They've redefined a tuna handroll for me. Many of the fish tasted completely different here compared to a regular sushi restaurant. The quality is so high! No need for soy sauce. The textures, the flavours, the presentation, the service - an absolutely perfect meal. I didn't really like the soy ice cream. A new experience, but I just don't like the flavour of soy milk. I prefer black sesame ice cream. Their house-made black sesame ice cream is so flavourful. Shiso leaves are my favourite food. Their homemade shiso sorbet is a perfect piece of heaven. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"My top favourite sushi place!! Its a fair price for the omakase and it was delicious. We sat right at the sushi bar and we were served piece by piece :) so heavenly!! Everything was so fresh. My favourite thing was at the end of the omakase they give you a Toro Negi Roll. It was so good!!   Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall .... Food was expensive and Food portions small.  Small selection on menu ... Very surprised from reviews.  However the service was friendly and fast. Still ... would have preferred to be feed with good food .. Sigh"}
{"text":"Seriously best sushi in Toronto!  The quality of the fish, the attentive service... WELL worth the price of the meal.  Would gladly spend $300+ dollars on a meal here again."}
{"text":"One of the best Japanese restaurants in the city!! The fish is very fresh and great quality. My favourite is the Chirashi dish which serves several types of sashimi. Make sure you make a reservation because the place is quite small."}
{"text":"A very traditional Japanese place with phenomenal food. Authentic and the fish is always high quality. What separates this place apart is the hot food options which are delicious tradtional goodness. I will second the previous nods to the tonkatsu.  Located in an unassuming strip mall, it's a bit out of the way but worth the trip. Make reservations. Sort of a hidden gem but those who seek out top notch Japanese food know about this place. It is a top 5 sushi restaurant in the GTA."}
{"text":"Zen!! I am so happy you are so close to me now!! But it also means I will be dropping a LOT of bills on you!!!  Came here on a weekday with a friend to do our annual Christmas dinner and it did not disappoint at all!! Before i dive into the review, I want to let everyone know it's best to make a reservation so they can seat you at some of their better spots (the room at the back?).  Food is expensive here and I already knew this because I went to the Zen at the old location.  My friend and I both went with the omakase sushi meal that comes with two appetizers, your 14 pieces of sushi (chef choice) and a dessert.  The overall experience was wonderful, when every dish came, the server would carefully explain what they are and how are they made.  I was super impressed with the sushi, the chef lined them up from the weakest flavour to strongest so you truly taste the freshness and uniqueness of each sushi by ensuring one does not over shadow the one previously. The 14 sushi were all amazing and I can't really tell you which one i loved the most!  I highly recommend this place if you want a more traditional Japanese sushi experience and of course for a special occasion due to the steep price.  PS. They got salt water eel at this location too (anago) and I will make sure I try next time, I had them at another restaurance before they are MUCH MUCH better than your regular fresh water eel (unagi)"}
{"text":"I heard many good things from my friends about this restaurant and decided to bring a visitor from HK to this place and check it out.  When I first arrived, I wasn't sure if this was the place, from the outside, it looked super small and the area was a bit ghetto, but regardless, we decided to walk in.  We ordered the Sushi Omakase and the Sashimi Omakase, both together were already $104 plus tips and tax, but I thought they both were worth the price.  The chef selected the best sashimi of the day and out of the whole dish, I was super impressed with the crab meat sushi!  No it's not those fake crab meat you see at those all you can eat, it was ACTUALLY meat straight from a crab!  Overall the sushi and sashimi were super fresh and if you are a sushi lover like me, you will appreciate it!  Would I come back again next time? I would if it's a special occasion, mainly because the price is at the expensive end."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing it opening at the Markham Cineplex theatre. Overall the experience was very pleasant. The staff greeted you as you walked in, and were all very friendly. The authentic experience demonstrated throughout.   We ordered the sashimi plate, tappoyaki, and chicken don. Which was sufficient for two people!The price was a bit high for lunch, but you pay for what you get. The quality of the sashimi was very good, I really liked the chicken Don too. The portion was perfect, because other sushi place stuffs you with rice when you order the chicken Don."}
{"text":"Summary: This is my third visit to Zen Japanesse restaurant over two years and the five star rating truly reflects the consistent and impeccable quality of sashimi served in this establishment without failing.  --  Ambiance and location (3/5): Located in a run down strip plaza besides an abandoned store, Jamaican fast food and an 'All-Star Bowling', Zen restaurant can't pick a more shadier location than this. The interior is slightly more forgiving with clean and comfortable seating arrangement despite being on the small side.   Food (5/5): There's no question that Zen Japanese Restaurant perches at the top of the food chain in Sushi/Sashimi category. The Omakase is impeccable and all the ingredients (Sea urchin, Toro, Squid, Sweet shrimp, etc) was served fresh and cut beautifully and without doubt shows the chef's true mastery on the subject. If you're looking for the finest sushi in GTA - seek no further!  Service (5/5): Service is incredibly gracious. Our server was very attentive throughout the evening and offered genuine recommendations on the dishes that we wished to try out. Despite being incredibly packed, the service is prompt.  Overall Value (5/5): The restaurant is reasonably priced - expect to spend $50-$100 per person depending on how well you want to eat."}
{"text":"Zen may not look like much, but upon entering you're immediately drawn to the simplistic yet sophistication of this place. In keeping with its reputation as being one of the best sushi places to go to in the GTA, Zen focuses on quality and presentation. Their service is excellent, well mannered and very accommodating. As for ambiance it truly is a beautiful and intimate with hints of Japanese architecture. As for the dining experience, I highly recommend the counter seats as you get the opportunity to interact with the chefs as they prepare you're meal providing you some details about what is being served to you.  This also gives you the opportunity to see and have a greater appreciation for their culinary work in putting each dish beautifully together. She had the Omakase Meal for one which featured a full course.  I on the other hand had the Omakase Sushi meal all prepared by our chef.   Both meals were fantastic highlighting the quality, freshness and delicacy almost a melt-in-your-mouth type of experience.   This place is ideal if you're taking clients to or celebrating a special occasion.  The prices can be a bit steeeeep, however sometime you can't put a price on quality.   Overall a excellent place! :)"}
{"text":"I had some high expectations for this place because I've eaten at Kaji numerous times and love the food there. My mom and sister told me that Zen is even better than Kaji so I was excited to eat some good sushi. We all ordered the Kaiseki tasting menu which was $125/person and a bottle of saki. This tasting menu featured 7 principle dishes with the main course being an A4 Wagyu which I was excited to try. I've eaten A5 at Sixteen in Chicago and loved it there. The A4 is a step below the A5 but still fantastic.  The raw fish here is really really fresh and it's also very good. The other courses are also good as well. I would say they are between better than average and good. However, some of the appetizer dishes didn't really give me that wow factor. Also, the number of dishes and the sizes of them are pretty small and I left here still hungry.   My main gripe is that I wouldn't pay $125/person for that tasting menu. I would pay about $80-90 for it. If it was set at that price, then I'd give Zen 4 stars. Also, their explanation of certain plates were kind of lacking in detail and I would have liked some more explanation on what I was eating and in which order to eat them which never came.   Overall, the food wasn't bad. I still prefer Kaji over Zen but I wouldn't say no to coming back and giving them another star."}
{"text":"I used to frequent their old location, which was in the ghetto part of east Toronto and next to a titty bar and bowling alley.  At their new location, I was underwhelmed.  I had their sushi omakase and it just wasn't up to par in comparison to competing omakase places... or even the omakase that they used to offer at their previous joint. The fish presented to us was noticeably a step down from what we were served by them in the past. Maybe because the rent is higher at their new location? Maybe they're trying to recuperate their costs from the development of their new restaurant? I'm not sure, but whatever it is, there are just better places to go now.  If you can't find them, they're just south of the Mandarin Restaurant."}
{"text":"All superlatives of excellence apply! This is better than any other sushi that I have had. It is better than Japango in downtown Toronto which was my previous favorite in the Greater Toronto Area.   Every aspect of the experience is perfect. The service was better than perfect: the waiter even washed our personal chopsticks (yes, my wife and I are that serious about Asian food - we carry our own chopsticks with us everywhere).  I am a stingy tipper, but our server will be getting a substantial boost to her income this evening.   And the food: I had the miso black cod, and the chef's selection of sushi. Presentation was beautiful, and much unlike my normal habit, I had no soy sauce or wasabi with each item; the quality of the fish was such that any addition to the chef's intention would have been a grave insult to the chef and to the fish itself.   I will bring all my foodie friends here to experience this most excellent of experiences."}
{"text":"Sit at the bar, order the omakase sushi ($80) and eat with your hand - it's not the same otherwise.   The fish is very fresh and the chefs are very well trained in the knife skills. When you get the omakase sushi, there are 13 pieces of premium sushi plus a chopped otoro hand roll.  In order: hamachi, flute, salmon, scallop, amberjack, snapper, sweet shrimp, uni, 3 cuts of bluefin, horse mackerel, unagi.   The 13 pieces are generally pretty standard and more \"common\", which is better for beginners to the omakase scene. The couple beside us were regulars and they got fish that I've never seen before, which is super cool.   The otoro handroll was amazing- they don't just take the leftover cuts of tuna and chop it up into a roll, they actually use their sharp knives to chop good pieces and use a special seaweed from Kyushu which tastes super fresh.  UNFORTUNATELY I was already super full by that piece so I couldn't enjoy it as much - I would have to say that they could ease up on the rice for the sushi!   Also, they are super busy so despite their restaurant being called \"Zen\", it was anything but; they make sure you get out quick once you're done to let more tables in. It's a good way to get your sushi fix but if you're looking for amazing ambiance where you can enjoy each course, go to Shoushin."}
{"text":"Location isn't great but MUST try their omakase! One of the few Japanese places in the city with the freshest fish"}
{"text":"Right off the bat, this place is amazing. A rare old school sushi place in a city of all you can eat garbage everywhere. You pay more but you get Tokyo quality sushi right here in Markham. Highly recommended but expect to pay over $100 per person. If you are not willing to fork out the money on real sushi then take your chances of poisoning yourself at one of the many AYCE sushi places around the city."}
{"text":"My fantastic boyfriend took me here for a surprise birthday dinner and this was by far the most well rounded dining experience I've had in quite some time. Take someone special here and you will not regret it! (See photos of food details!)  My boyfriend chose a pre-fix type menu which comes with an assortment of appetizers. The flavours were all amazing and such unique, complex layers. It's so well thought out that every bite has been pre-planned and arranged for you. The waitress takes her time to explain what each plate is and how to best enjoy the experience before leaving you to go to gastric heaven. They started us off with a shrimp appetizer over a broth gelatin and a shrimp head chip to finish that bite. Like everything we had that night, I was blown away by just how much flavour was infused to each and every bite. \"BLAND\" is NOT in their dictionary. Next we moved onto an array of fish and octopus with a wonderful side broth and delightful seaweed salad. The textures were so different across the board and yet, it was complimentary. And to end off the apps, we got a Miso Soup and some cold noodles in flavourful broth. I'm not usually a fan of cold noodles, but this one was very pleasant. Nothing over whelming, but just enough acidity and savory broth to make it enjoyable.   Moving on, we had our sushi. The chef took his time to explain each fish he was presenting to us and I've got them all photographed (though more justice could have been done haha) below. The fish is fresh, stored well, treated with respect, and paired with whatever sauce or toppings the chef believes will enhance the natural flavours of the fish in the best light. Sometimes it was a dab of wasabi, a brush of flavoured soy sauce, sprinkle of sea salt, or brushed with the zest of a fresh lime. The chef was so friendly the whole time and they make you feel very comfortable there with the other guests sitting next to you. I don't believe I'll ever enjoy sushi the same way again. haha!  Lastly, we had our dessert. They had a candle in my dessert for my birthday and I thought it was just so perfect and sweet that the macaron on the plate was shaped as a heart :) Delicious from start to finish! I cannot rave enough about that tofu ice cream though. If you've ever had the tofu pudding dessert at a Chinese sweet shop, it tastes JUST LIKE THAT. creamy and milky and perfect. I could honestly get a whole tub of those and just watch some TV and devour it all.  Absolutely perfect from the moment you walk in to the food and to the moment you are finishing your meal. Be sure to book a bar seat so you can watch the chefs create the sushi! The staff are just incredible here and, like I said, just the most well rounded place. Comes with a hefty price so maybe not a weekly thing haha but it's definitely worth the experience.   Thank you to my amazing boyfriend for this one of a kind dinner. I've lived in Markham forever and never even knew this place existed! So all you Yelper's out there, make sure you tell your significant other about Yelp. That way, they can plan a dinner you know you'll enjoy ;)"}
{"text":"The benchmark for sushi in the GTA. Well worth the money, it will change your perception of sushi.  I've gotten the omakase sushi every time we go and I always sit at the bar so I can watch the sushi chefs exercise their craft. It's a really beautiful thing to watch them create the perfect bite of sushi for you. At the bar they will make each nigiri one at a time and serve it to you so you don't need to worry about what order to eat them in. You should eat as soon as they put it down so it's fresh (My mouth is watering as I'm typing).   All their ingredients are of the best quality and come from all over the world. Since you're at the bar and right in front of the sushi chef, ask him questions about what you're eating. They're very friendly!  You can tell they love what they do as you watch them react to patrons reacting to the sushi they just tasted. Take your time enjoying each piece. Close your eyes and feel the textures and taste the complexity of each creation.   My eyes actually watered while eating the last item because it was so good.  Other than what I've said, let them surprise you with the layers of flavours they've mastered to give you the privilege to enjoy!  Although this restaurant is quite high-end in food quality and service, you don't need to be wearing a tuxedo or a dress. Casual attire is fine."}
{"text":"The hype is all justified. It's that good. We didn't go the omekaze route, sadly, I just had the lunch special of the day, and it was awesome. Zen is a quiet, unassuming little place in a strip mall, but the inside is beautiful. The fish was incredibly fresh and far better than anywhere I've been before, and there's an air of authenticity that comes with being served sushi without the obligatory side of wasabi. Why's that? Because the chef knows what the fish needs, and there's adequate wasabi already in your sushi. That used to be how it was always done, before sushi became a common fast food for everyone. Nice to see somewhere that does it right."}
{"text":"The fish is fresh and service is excellent.  There is a good selection of cold sakes.  The menu is the traditional Japanese fare, with not too much selection.  However, they are very accommodating, making us dishes that were not on the menu.  We ordered a kampachi kama (not on menu) and it was very well done.    Even though outside the restaurant is somewhat seedy, the outside is still well lit and we didn't feel uneasy.  The inside is simply yet elegantly decorated, \"zen\" indeed."}
{"text":"Owned and operated by Japanese. High quality food and great ambiance. Pricey but worth the price. Great for special occasion"}
{"text":"Excellent food and attentive service, relaxing atmosphere. I loved the Soba noodles and the sashimi was delicious and beautifully presented. The wait staff were friendly and helpful. When the craving for Sushi returns I will visit again. Thanks Zen! PS: Yes, the strip mall they are located in is pretty seedy but certainly not intimidating, remember, they have been in business since 1983 and locations can change over time. Having said that, Zen is a destination restaurant, you are going there for THEM not their particular location."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place? Always amazing fresh food with attentive staff. Had the sushi and sashimi dinner course and I was full! We can't afford to come here everyday but definitely a place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We go to Zen Janapanese Restaurant at least twice a month to enjoy the omakase sushi course or just omakase sushi with some appetizers.  Sushi bar seat is a must if you are having omakase sushi, it's made for you right in front of you.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came with my girlfriend for my birthday on a Friday night, and reservations are a must. They took our coats at the front and were seated at the sushi bar. The atmosphere and service is a bit more relaxed, and we were given a wet towel and a place setting. It all reminded me of actual experiences in Japan.  We both ordered the Omakase Sushi Course, which comes with some appetizer dishes, the sushi course, and a dessert. The appetizer dishes felt like a mix of traditional Japanese, sometimes with a more modern topping, so were quite interesting. There was also a light soup.  After that came the sushi course, made right in front of you if you're at the bar. There were 12 pieces of nigiri sushi (including one very delicious seared tuna piece), followed by the BEST Tuna + Green Onion roll I've ever had. The seaweed is so crispy, so they tell you to eat it quick as they hand it to you.  Dessert was a coffee jelly, a very sweet honeydew slice and some pieces of a light mochi. All in all, the meal was very good. Price was on the high end but reasonable."}
{"text":"Zen has camouflaged, and it's easy to miss.  Look for Area One KTV lounge, and Zen is just next to it.  We were greeted right away after walking through the hallway and through the noren.  Our seats at the bar were ready for us.  We had the okamase sushi and sashimi course.  Both courses came with appetizers, nyumen with lobster and noodles and desserts.  The sashimi came all in one time, but the sushi came one at a time.  I enjoyed watching the chef sliced the fish.  Each piece was sliced beautifully and to the right thickness.  The rice was pressed just to the right size into a pellet in his hands.   He gave spark to the sushi by brushing special soy sauce, or dusted lemon/lime zest.  Adding some citrus to some of the sushi was refreshing.  I would highly recommend sitting at the bar and have the okamase sushi. It's nice to watch the chef performs right in front of you, sculpturing the sushi and putting that masterpiece right on your plate a piece after piece.    I put my pair of chopsticks aside and begun to use my hand to pick up the sushi: so raw and primitive!  The fish were very fresh and they all melted in my mouth.  Soy ice cream was awesome!  Excellent service!  Price?!  A bit pricey, but worth it.  Make a reservation well in advance!!"}
{"text":"Went last night and ordered the broiled beef tongue, Tokujyo sushi and a side of sea urchin (uni). The beef tongue was tender, good chew, and tasty. The uni was creamy and mild w/ a touch of sweetness, but no brininess or hint that it came from the sea.   The fish in the Tokujyo sushi plate was nice and fresh. Tuna, medium fatty tuna, salmon, spanish mackerel, scallop, sweet shrimp, and what looked to be a medium tuna roll w/ the strong taste of shiso leaf, along w/ some other pieces. The sushi itself though, for the most part, had too much wasabi. The waitress informed us this was because people tended to mix their wasabi and soy together, then dip the nigiri in it. Since they don't provide extra wasabi, they just add it to the nigiri. Problem is that I didn't know this, and with good quality fish, I don't over sauce the nigiri so I kept ending up with sinus clearing loads of wasabi in some of the pieces. Other pieces where the fish didn't need it, they used less wasabi. Keep that in mind if you go.  All in all, w/ a couple soft drinks, the meal came to $90 for two, incl. tax. I'm definitely booking a table at the bar next time I go so I can get a better interaction w/ the chef."}
{"text":"Zen was the reason I started to hate AYCE sushi. In fact, I'm sure I lost several friends because I no longer want to eat with them if they're going to an AYCE place. They say I've become a sushi snob but I say they haven't experienced REAL sushi yet.  I went to Japan last year in hopes of experiencing some authentic sushi and I did.   All I can say is that Zen is on par with the quality in Japan, all in the convenience of my backyard. The area is a bit dodgy yes but all good restaurants are in the sketchiest areas. That's why they're hidden gems :)  I always get the sushi omakase with fresh wasabi. The grilled cod is one of my fav appetizers and the mandarin pie is to die for. I often ask them to reserve me a slice because one time they sold out and I almost cried.   Be careful... Do not come here if you love your AYCE sushi and appreciate good food because once you eat here, there's no going back."}
{"text":"Celebrated our 9 year wedding anniversary!!! What an amazing place to celebrate . The whole experience was amazing  - service and of course the food. We both had two full course meal - one sashimi and the other one was the tasting menu. Everything was eye catching and fresh..."}
{"text":"People like to compare Zen and Shoushin, as these are the two main places for high end sushi on the north side of Toronto (Zen just south of 14th and Woodbine, Shoushin just south of Lawrence and Yonge).  Zen is in a very odd place - a small strip plaza next to a Mandarin (funny cause Mandarin is an absolutely horrible place for food) and beside Akiba Kissa. Though the plaza is tiny and easy to pass by, the restaurant is very easy to see from the road if you're looking - the big wooden slats and big \"Zen\" sign was easily visible when I drove by this morning.  Always sit at the sushi bar for the best experience. Always always. Today our sushi chef was Cho-san and he was great. He spoke Mandarin and English which was interesting to me - it does make Zen more accessible I suppose to the many mainlanders in Markham. Even so, he definitely knew his stuff when we asked him many questions as I'm fairly new to omakase and high-end sushi. I may not be as well-versed as others here, but I think everything he made was delicious and made with care and detail... on par with Shoushin I think. Which makes sense given that Jackie Lin at Shoushin was trained here at Zen.  We had the omakase sushi for $80 which includes 13 pieces of sushi and a handroll. In my opinion... more palatable than the $130 that Shoushin has for their their most basic omakase option. It used to be $85 but it has jumped in price, though it does include a couple extra appetizers and dessert (not worth the +$50 for me though).  In order we had: Hamachi (Yellowtail), Hirame (Fluke), Ocean trout, Scallop, Kanpachi (Amberjack) which was my personal favorite of the night, Tai (sea bream), Ebi (sweet shrimp), Uni (sea urchin), maguro (lean tuna), chutoro (middle ground), otoro (fatty tuna), aji (horse mackerel), unagi (eel), and a tuna belly handroll with onions.  Each piece of sushi has wasabi though you can ask for it without. I saw a review that said there was too much wasabi but I didn't experience this - if anything, I thought it was a perfect balance and my wasabi tolerance is very low. Certain pieces were garnished with a yuzu zest that brought out the sweetness of the fish, or sea salt, or lime juice. It was all delicious and watching the chefs make it was a great experience.  The unagi was an experience - the best I've had, soft and flavorful. The otoro was oddly not very fatty, which I kind of like actually - over time I've come not to like incredibly buttery rich foods like foie gras, lindor chocolates, and otoro falls in that category so it was okay for me. But it was not as fatty as other places if that's what you're looking for. The tuna belly handroll was also delicious and the seaweed they use for their uni and the handroll was so crisp and fresh and delicious.  For dessert we had a matcha ice cream ($8) and shiratama sundae (?)($11.50) The matcha ice cream was my favorite - so fragrant and so refreshing. The shiratama sundae came with a soy milk ice cream which was quite unique and red bean paste and soft, pillowy shiratama. Also delicious. Though this costs extra, these desserts were better than Shoushin's.  If I had to I would pick Zen over Shoushin for the atmosphere that they've created. Not that Shoushin isn't good - it's great, but I found Zen to be more my style. At Shoushin the atmosphere is more serious and very quiet and the decor is beautiful - the ambiance is actually more zen-like than Zen. The service there is great but in a different way - very formal, almost stiff but not unfriendly. Great service, but I'm not used to people pulling out chairs for me.  Zen was very different. Service was also great but in a different way - more hands off and it felt more natural to me. Even the smiles that they gave me felt more natural. It's certainly louder than Shoushin, but that's because they encourage talking and they are definitely more interactive I found with the customers than at Shoushin. Perhaps you can say at Shoushin the focus is on the food. Even though Cho-san was our sushi chef, Chef Seiichi was also very friendly and took the time to talk to us even though he wasn't serving us and even when he was serving another group as well (who he also talked to). They fielded my questions about different fishes, pulling out trays of fish to show me what they looked like and describing where they came from and showing us which part of the fish the sushi came from on a smartphone. I think they were excited that I was excited to learn.  I felt much more relaxed at Zen, oddly enough, than at Shoushin where I felt like I couldn't even cough or sneeze and felt like I was always being watched by a waiter/waitress who was always present. I left really happy with the experience and even as we left, Chef Seiichi thanked us for coming and the group he was with even turned and smiled at us when we thanked the chef for a delicious dinner. This is the kind of atmosphere they've built at Zen and because of that, Zen is my pick over Shoushin."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to be writing a 2 star review for our old favorite restaurant.  Like many other reviewers who frequented their Scarborough location, my husband and I had a disappointing experience.    We made a reservation and was excited to experience Zen in its new location.  When we arrived, we still had to wait extra 25 - 30 min to be seated all the way in the back of the restaurant.  From then on, everything went downhill at least service wise.    It took another 20 minutes to place our drink and food order (one omakase sushi course meal and one omakase sashimi meal).  All the food was tasty but so slow in coming out that by the time we finished our meal, 2 and a half hour had passed (on top of our initial wait time to sit down)!    I don't know about most of you but 3 hrs is a long time to spend at any restaurant and even with good food."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Japanese restaurant, anywhere (and I've been to Japan a few times!) If my opinion isn't enough, it's also been highly rated in the Toronto Life magazine's Food & Drink edition several times over the years. Do not let its location deceive you: it's located in a somewhat run-down neighbourhood, in a tiny plaza next to a convenience store, blink and you might miss it. But if you're looking for good food, and fresh sushi, this is your place. It's a small location, so reservations are recommended, especially on weekends and holidays (I've been turned away before).  I've been coming here for years (so often, that the wait staff know my order, down to the drink) and that in itself is a testimony to the quality of food that is served here. I typically order the Zen menu, which is the restaurant's version of a prix fixe meal. It's served with miso soup, salad (served with what has got to be the best dressing on a salad I've ever had), California rolls (just delicious), tofu, a choice between teriyaki steak, salmon (and perhaps chicken, though I'm not 100% certain) and dessert. I always order the teriyaki steak, which is consistently cook exactly the way I want it. In my opinion, also the best place to have Spider Rolls (my favourite!) The staff has been exactly the same for as long as I can remember (at least a decade, now). The service is always impeccable, you will not regret coming here."}
{"text":"We went for a birthday meal a couple of weeks ago and sat at the bar.  We ordered a sushi omakase and a sashimi omakase.  As the chef served us with what was probably the most fantastically fresh Japanese sea bream to start our meal, we were already hooked on Zen!  I couldn't even begin to list all the beautifully prepared sushi and sashimi that followed as the variety of fish was quite impressive.  No salmon or butterfish here!!!!  Yay!  Another thing we really loved about our experience was the freshly grated wasabi the chef kept replacing on our plates.  He wouldn't let us eat the wasabi he had just grated 10 min ago and insisted on grating fresh mounds for us to enjoy with our fish.  I notice that some of their fish had wonderful yuzu scent which just whetted our appetites even more.  To finish our meal, they served us a mandarin orange pie on the house.  It's amazing value at $50 each for this quality of omakase.  We're definitely going back."}
{"text":"Although I've frequently lunched here, I hadn't been for dinner until last night -- and Zen delivered big time.  To start with, we were seated in nice both with mats, shoes off, and had wonderfully attentive service.  Started off with Tsukimi Natto,, fermented soybeans with a quail egg, not for everyone but it was a great and not common way to kick things off.  Grilled squid in ginger sauce followed, and it was ample sized and perfectly done.  Ditto for the miso marinated black cod.  We opted to share the chef's omakase sushi, and it was brilliant -- no wasabi mound, as each piece was individually seasoned, some with yuzu, others with ginger, some, like the ebi with just the right touch of wasabi.  We ended with udon noodles in a delicious light broth with tempura shrimp -- served with a chili salt  mix that came out in a delightful little wooden box.   A great meal, food was perfect, very relaxing, and very different from the in-out lunch experience.  The bill was under $100 for the two of us.  The meal a lot better than other Japanese I've had over the years in tinier establishments  In my book Zen is the best Japanese restaurant in town.  I'm lucky to work nearby."}
{"text":"In my opinion you don't come here to fill your belly but you come here for a great food experience. I recommend eating at the bar where you can see the sushi masters at work and plus you get to have a pleasant chat with them while they prepare your food. Many fellow Yelpers already recommended the omakase so I had to give it a try no matter what the price. The omakase does not show up on the lunch menu so I had to ask for it and was told its $52.50. I already knew the price but I just had to ask to be sure. I came here on a solo mission as there are not many that are willing to throw down $50 plus for lunch.  Each sushi piece was served individually one by one and the chef would tell you what type of fish it was you were eating and where it came from. Most of which came directly from Japan according to the chef.   The omakase came with 13 pieces of sushi, so at $52.50 its $4.03 for every piece you eat. I didn't swallow until my tongue got every texture and flavor it could absorb. 1) blue flounder 2) cuddle fish 3) Isaki 4) Mutsu 5) otoro 6) sea eel 7) sea urchin 8) seabream 9) shrimp 10) snowcrab 11) tuna 12) yellow tail 13) blue fin tuna  Service was top notch. My tea cup was never empty and ginger was refilled without asking. The chef made the experience even better with his commentary of the food. The place is pretty small and was almost packed on a Thursday afternoon. Yes, the food is very expensive but you are also paying for the experience."}
{"text":"Full Omakase is excellent. Quality above all. This is definitely more upscale restaurant with a lot of attention to the service. I can't really comment on table service as I was at the bar and everything came pretty quickly. Compared to NY prices, Omakase is actually not that expensive. It is only losing one star because I don't think the menu is set up properly. Price difference between full omakase and just sushi menu not that big. I would keep the same food, just offer it in a different way. For this price range, you have to do better.  As a side note, I wanted to try the futomaki which were really good. I would only recommend the futomaki if you want to get really really full...  otherwise sake, appetizers and deserts were absolutely delicious. Very original but respecting Japanese traditional flavors. Well done chef!"}
{"text":"excellent japanese restaurant. been there twice already. Chef's omakase is served the way it should be. a bit pricey but stands out from the other restaurant so you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Went here for their \"kaseiki\" menu.  The service started off a bit on an off note - we asked our server for sake recommendations and received no helpful suggestions, nor was anyone else brought over to explain the extensive sake list.  So in the end, we got the sake sampler - definitely a missed opportunity for a sale here.  The noodles in broth that came out first was absolutely fantastic.  I really enjoyed everything about it and it boded really well for the meal. The assorted appetizers that came out next looked really good - and we ate them in the order that the server described the dishes. The chawanmushi was absolutely fantastic; so delicate and flavourful, and most of the other things were ok. The sashimi was pretty good, and the fish quality was fantastic.     After that, things went a bit off kilter.  The Wagyu was pretty decent, but at 6 slices, it was perhaps a bit too much: there wasn't anything to cleanse the palate during or after the dish, and given the amount of fat in it, i think it would have been a great idea.  The tempura (lobster and otherwise) was merely ok - again, a slight bit greasy with no easy way to remove it before trying the next dish.  The sushi dish? i was happy with the toro, but there wasn't any nikiri and i easily overdunked the fish in soy sauce :(  I would have expected better. And I forgot which fish it was, but one of the pieces had a bit that seemed a bit chewy - i think it could have been cut a bit better.  And perhaps slightly smaller pieces wouldn't be a bad idea for easy of handling.  But overall, it was ok. The desserts - the matcha cookie, i can do without. It was exceedingly dense and i dont think it goes well with the black sesame ice cream (which was really good).  The three pieces of arrow root cake was maybe also too much of a good thing; i'd like to see three types, one plain as served, one with water chestnuts, and one with goji berries or something.  The red bean rice ball at the end i would be ok with not having either.     In the end, I am ok with the food and the price point, but I was definitely not wowed.  The pace of delivery was a bit off, and I wouldn't mind some small tweaks being made to food items.  And if you're going to have such a large select of sake with non-trivial price points, it would be a great idea to have someone who knows what those bottles are and can explain why someone would want to try them.  I'd go back, but it wasn't something that wowed me enough to make me think of an occasion to make an excuse to come back sooner than later."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Zen, having been my first time here. I was very confused at the location first - and without noticing the small signage staring right in front of me, I drove around the plaza once to realize it was right in the front. I would suggest they look to update their signage, but if they're trying to stay low key, that's fine with me too.  We ordered the SUSHI KAISEKI which was phenomenal. Each dish was so meticulously prepared and with such care and perfection in presentation - it could only remind me of dining at a Michelin star restaurant, to be honest.  The menu: - Tamago Tofu (Egg Tofu with Lobster) - Zensai (Assorted Appetizers) - Hotate & Nyumen (Scallop with Japanese thin noodle in broth) - Sashimi Moriawase (Chef's Special Choice Sashimi) - Gindara Yuan Yaki (Grilled Black Cod, marinated with Yuzu & Sake) - Wagyu Suki-Nabe (A4 Wagyu, Japanese Beef Striploin in hot pot) - Omakase Sushi (Chef's Special Choice Sushi) - Toro Handroll - Homemade Dessert  Every dish brought a different format, presentation and experience. The Hotate & Nyumen and the Wagyu Suki-Nabe were soup/broth based and the had a clear but striking flavour full of umami.   The sushi and sashimi was also fantastic - with great presentation and delicious flavour to every piece. The rice vinegar used was slightly higher than you would expect - but works well and brings out the flavour of the fish even further."}
{"text":"???????????? ?????? ???????????????? (????sushi?) ? ??????? ???????? great lunch! But I wish they had the same service as omakaze dinner."}
{"text":"Just called to make a reservation. Asked if they had availability. The guys just said \"No.\" and hung up on me. I now have ZERO interest in going to a place that behaves like this to people on the phone. There are plenty of other Japanese restaurants in town with great or better food (and value for your money!) who know how to treat customers properly."}
{"text":"The good: one of the best sushi I have tried around the Toronto area. From presentation, to taste, to texture, to vibe, and to whatever sushi lovers feel - this place is as good as it gets. First, the design of this place is stunning. I love the decor, the spacing is good, lighting is amazing, and the environment feels nice. Service is great. But most importantly, the sushi. It was fantastic! I had the chef special (the lower priced option, can't remember how much though..). Going through each sushi piece is like an adventure. Each piece has its own unique taste, its own unique personality. Just amazing. There was not one piece that was better than the other. Sushi hand roll is part of the menu, that itself was good too. But, wow to end it off, dessert. They made in my own opinion, the best matcha ice cream ever, the best hands down. It had so much matcha flavour, refer to my picture post to see how green it is! Amazing! The Mochi wasn't bad :)  The bad: seating is super limited so be sure to reserve.  The ugly: $$$$$$$$$. If you know what I mean ;)  Neutral: again seating is limited so reserve. Dress to impress. Good as a date place or a group (there are private rooms)."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. The first time we set at the sushi bar, which is always a cool experience. Fish is top notch. Staff is friendly. Good saki."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of value-to-quality ratios in food. At the same time, I'm a bigger fan of good tasting food. While this place fulfilled the latter, the former was heavily disappointed in my decisions. I paid $60 dollars (plus tax and tip actually came out to $70) for the \"Omakase Sashimi\" dish. While the quality and variety of the fish was great, I really couldn't justify spending that amount of money on it, especially when restaurants like Ni Ji Sushi exist just 4km away.  TL;DR (the rest is a lot of word vomit): This place is meant for sushi snobs who don't put a price on their experiences. As a student, it's expensive for me, and I like feeling full when I eat food (that doesn't happen here). If you want an authentic Japanese sushi experience, this is the place for you. If you want other value for your money (feeling full), look elsewhere!  The portions were also not that big - for an Omakase dish, I actually figured they would be serving me more things, but nope -- that's only for the \"Omakase Sushi\" dish. Yes, the sashimi dish gives more in terms of variety, but the sheer \"quantity\" of food goes to the less-expensive Sushi dish, since there were multiple courses (omakase sashimi only has the one dish, see picture). I was nowhere close to full after eating this, and I realized afterwards that this dish was more of a \"quality\" over \"quantity\" food, which annoyed me, because I wanted to be full when I was eating with friends, not \"partially satiated but could still eat a Whopper afterwards because of the small amount of food I paid way too much for\". I would price this at no higher than $40 - the markup (you can tell) is at least 300% right now, so it felt like an overpriced (crappy, terrible, self-loathing) Apple experience than anything else.  I think the biggest selling point from this restaurant though is that they have actual JAPANESE sushi chefs, rather than chefs of a different nationality or background. I give them that, but I can't give them more than 3 stars for the amount of disappointment I feel.   The menu is not descriptive at all; there's no pictures, and the descriptions they do give are so vague and generic I had no idea what I would be getting, in terms of the sushi/sashimi (they don't tell you on the menu, just \"chef's specialty choice\"). The other dishes have maximum 5 words describing what the dish is, but again, knowing how small the portion sizes were, I would have opted for a cheaper $20 dish that gave me some kind of meat & sushi combination.  Definitely a \"high-end\" restaurant, but I think you're paying more for the atmosphere (pretty Japanese-like, the booths we sat in at the back, you have to remove your shoes before entering) and the fact that the chefs are actually Japanese.  There's not that much seating, so without a reservation you're probably not getting in (what the heck - why do people come here?), so book early!  Service also wasn't that great, granted it was busy so maybe that's the case, but I still found it unacceptable that I had to wait 20 minutes to get my tea cup refilled the first time, then another 15 minutes the second time (the rest of my table had empty teacups for most of their meals as well). I don't understand how all of these 5 and 4 star reviews came up - I can't see these guys as any higher than a three, and that's only for the authenticity of the experience above anything else."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. I am friends with some serious Japanese food lovers and so we decided to check this place out for dinner one evening. The place itself is small so a reservation is a must if you want to secure seating. The menu is also small so it's quality over quantity here. The prices here are not so small, menu items are pretty expensive. A sashimi course for one is about $40 however, it is very fresh and tasty.  I opted out of sashimi and instead opted for the duck which came out really tasty but the portion size is so tiny. I wanted to try the tofu dish but they were out. A few other menu items were also out as well ( Tempura was just okay. You don't come to this type of place and pay this type of prices for tempura anyways. The AYCE places make those just fine. They do have some interesting dessert options though. If you love fresh fish, and have some extra change, this is the place for you to check out."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday celebration and what an experience!   At $120 a person you get apps, 13 pieces and dessert. Because we came for a birthday we got a special surprise dessert. The chef really takes the time to tell you about each piece of sushi that your having   Food and service was fantastic! Definitely worth the money in my option. And you have to sit at the chefs table to really experience the meal   The fish was super fresh and every bite just melts in your mouth.   Will definitely go back and recommend to others"}
{"text":"I went to the Scarborough location about a year an a half ago so I'm not sure how accurate this review is currently as they've moved and likely things have changed.  But I'm not sure what the hype is.  The sushi was great but nothing compared to some of the top notch places that I've been to.  I ordered a sashimi dinner with a friend and it was good but not mind-blowing.  Perhaps I will give this place another try at some point."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Alright, I've eaten at Zen before, back when it was in a very ghetto strip in Scarborough. I was very happy Zen moved north to Markham, as I believe that's where their market holds (higher income city, lots of Asians, etc).  I tried the new Zen for the first time on my mom's birthday, and was able to reserve the last seat a couple of Saturdays prior. That's how busy it is; you have to reserve very early beforehand.  The decorations look a lot nicer than the Scarborough location; it actually looks like an upscale Japanese place, instead of it being purely white walls. Definitely a job well done with their new location, which by the way...is quite easy to miss as it doesn't stand out very much.  My family of four ended up ordering two kaisekis, an omakase sushi course, and an omakase sashimi course, which meant we get the full Zen experience (as I would put it). It's obviously something I wouldn't do again, but since it was my mom's birthday...why not!  We started with the tamago tofu, which had a very unique and delicious sauce that make the egg . The dish was cold, but not bone chilling. Just the way I like it.   Next dish was the zensai, which had the mini octopus, duck breast, jello, veggie and mushroom soup (or sauce), and some shrimp bits salad thingy. Excellent once again on all counts.   Sashimi Moriawase was the next dish. Full points to the mid-toro and the amberjack, definitely some of the best I've ever had. I've never really been a sea urchin person, but my parents who had it also said it was delicious and not fishy.  Next was the nyumen with scallop, which personally I could've done without. The noodles weren't anything special, nor were the salad or the broth.  At this point the meals had separate dishes, but I'll cover our whole platter regardless. The gindara yuan yaki had an excellent butter taste, and the cod was neatly layered instead of it being scrunchy. The plum-like fruit wasn't my cup of tea, but my parents seemed to like it.  Wagyu Shabu Shabu was arguably the highlight of the tasting menu. The beef was, without question, the best I've ever eaten. Perfectly marbled, very smooth, and it just melts in your mouth. That's what true wagyu beef is supposed to be like, no question about it.  Omakase sushi was next, and it came with 14 different varieties of fish for the kaiseki menu or 7 varieties for the omakase sushi menu. Excellent all the way, although the rice was difficult to grasp properly as it wasn't packed tightly enough. I loved the squid and all the toros in particular. But wait, there's more! Toro handroll came as we were eating the sushi, and I'm gonna quote from my mom who hates handrolls: \"This is the only handroll I will ever eat in my life. It's that good. I can't believe I'm enjoying it, but I am\".  As for the assorted sashimi (omakase sashimi menu), that dish also had its unique varieties, mixed with some common fishes such as octopus, sweet shrimp, and yellow tail. Great all around, though by this time we were already all full.  Finally, dessert...black sesame ice cream, mochi, macaroons, and matcha ice cream. Yum, yum, yum, and yum.  Service was excellent; the servers will explain every single dish and the ingredients used. They will also be accommodating of any allergies or questions you may have.  I definitely won't have the kaiseki or any of the tasting menus next time, but my next visit will definitely focus more towards the a la carte options. It may be expensive, but this is what you expect from top end/high quality sushi!"}
{"text":"You want high-end sushi cuisine? This is the place.  The place is small, so you have to reserve I assume...we did. We were welcomed kindly by a lady and were promptly seated. The menu has a little less variety than a typical Japanese restaurant, but don't let that fool you.  We had futo maki, both plates of sushi (there's two prices and both have different kinds of sushi), salmon hand roll, uni(?) roll, salmon head and neck, ika yaki, and some tuna appetizer dish. Overall every single plate at least satisfied us, with top marks going to the salmon hand roll (neatly crafted), the sushi plates (very unique selection of fish), and the ika yaki (none of the pieces were burnt at all).  Service was excellent the whole way, and despite the fact our bill was $300+, I feel the experience we had was worth just about that.  Definitely come back if I'm looking for quality over quantity."}
{"text":"Since Mikado closed, Zen has become the 'go to' place for my mother if she's jonesing some food from the old country. After hearing so many good things about Zen, I decided to check it out myself on Friday.   It's in the middle of nowhere Scarborough so I would suggest driving here and not riding the Rocket. In a depressing strip mall, I missed it at first, but once I found it, appreciated that there's a parking lot. The inside of this place is very small and cozy so a reservation is a must! The menu is extensive, from (legit) sushi to other Japanese dishes, including donburi's (rice bowls), tempura, and curry. I had the Chicken Katsu Don and it was pretty tasty. The Mandarin Pie for dessert seemed like a good choice, but it was quite mediocre so I would suggest skipping it. My mother ordered sushi and she had nothing, but praise to say.  Good for: lunch, dinner, Japanese  NB - Reservations are a must !"}
{"text":"This place is the best in Toronto, no questions asked. What an experience. The seafood is sourced from Japan, and the chefs and owner's heart and souls go into this place.  I got the the Chirashi sushi, with the grilled squid as an appetizer and the homemade tart. Absolutely amazing. Price should be of no issue here considering the quality of the food, but it is expensive for those who are concerned."}
{"text":"WowZen!!! Definitely one of the top Japanese restaurants in the city. We were strongly encouraged to try Zen by a Japanese couple who we met in one of our foodventures. Where to start ... driving into the plaza you would never think that such a fine restaurant is located here, but once you walk through those doors ... pure Zen! It's small, but beautiful and clean. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and attentive. We did not go for the Omikase because we wanted to try the items we normally order in other Japanese restaurants. We ordered a soft-shell crab, Hamachi Kama (neck), uni (sea urchin) sushi, toro (tuna belly), hamachi (yellow tail) and salmon sashimi, spicy salmon temaki (hand roll), salmon skin and atlantic salmon maki. Everything was of the highest quality, super fresh, and the flavour ... amaZEN!! There are no sashimi boats here, everything is a la carte unless you go for the Omikase, and we will be returning for it very soon. Just ZENsational!!"}
{"text":"Execellent services, very welcoming. Clean and neat decorations made me feel like i went to Japan. Food is beyond expectation, fresh, delicate, fine tasted, a visual pleasure as well."}
{"text":"I ordered the omakase sushi, which is the chef's choice sushi. The chef prepares the sushi directly in front of you and the experience is amazing. The meal comes with noodles to start off with, followed by twelve delicious pieces of sushi of extremely high quality fish, a toro hand roll, and sake jello and soy milk ice cream for desert. The price is on the high side for the omakase sushi, but it is definitely work it."}
{"text":"Nice, clean, friendly place. Food fresh. Was expecting more exotic varieties.  The missing star was due to the moderately fresh uni."}
{"text":"I don't get the craze for this place. I've had it several times since their origin days when they were in a shanty plaza at south Scarborough where they neighbor barber shops and cash for gold stores with steel bars.  The food is fine, and you'd expect it at their price point but it's seriously nothing special and does not warrant what they charge. The service has been so slow every time I go that I feel embarrassed to bring my family or friends there due to that constant anxiety of seeing food serve SO slowly at other tables. Literally when a dish comes out, multiple tables pop their head up to see if it's their's, ugh."}
{"text":"One of the best japanese omakase places i've visted. Each piece blew my mind! Fresh, quality fish, and sitting at the bar was an amazing experience! I had the sushi course 1, and loved every single dish! The starter was a cold tofu, with a miso taste, and then we proceeded with something like a miso soup with noodles, then the omakse course. Finishing this amazing dinner with house-made soy milk sorbet, this was my favorite! Definately would try this place again to try the Kiseki course!"}
{"text":"My go to sushi place. Best sushi restaurant in Toronto. Most authentic omakase experience."}
{"text":"A very homey Japanese run place.  Came here with some Japanese coworkers after a meeting and had a nice sushi dinner.  They said I probably had better Japanese food in San Francisco but I'm not so sure.    This area reminded me of both LA and New Jersey at the same time.  Tons of strip malls and giant apartment complexes."}
{"text":"For those that truly appreciates quality over quantity in sushi, this is the place for you. Make reservations because this place is small. The waitress was very friendly attentive, refilling my tea and always making sure that everything was good.   Food: 4.5/5 Service: 4.5/5 Decor: 4/5  I had their grilled squid as an appetizer and it was very tender. Taste and texture was great and up to par with some of my favorite Japanese restaurants, but I do feel that it was sliced too thinly.  I skipped the omakase and ordered my own sushi a la carte.  I ordered the following:  aji (Spanish mackerel)  natto (fermented soy bean) - first time having this, it was not very pungent and has a very stringy/pasty texture. It was interesting to say the least. saba (mackerel) - this is not completely raw - it is cured in rice vinegar/salt - had a bit of a stronger taste to it and the texture was tougher than other types of sushi. Interesting, but not a favorite.  toro (fatty tuna) uni (sea urchin) - never fails. The uni here is very fresh and buttery. ebi (sweet shrimp) - shrimp here is bigger than what I am used to and not as sweet. (I was told by the waitress that there are 2 types of sweet shrimp) hamachi (yellowtail) kurodai (red snapper) - first time having this. The texture is similar to yellowtail.    All the fish was very fresh, rice was perfectly good, and the sushi was ALMOST perfectly made. I felt that the sushi fell apart a little too easily when I picked it up with my chopsticks. I was unable to flip it around to dip the fish side into my soy sauce without fear of it breaking apart.   And one of my favorite part of the meal...their dessert. Try their manderin pie!!!! Unexpected from a sushi restaurant, but hands down one of my favorite desserts. And it is made right in the restaurant.   Decor isn't a huge deal to me. It is a brightly lit restaurant, quiet atmosphere. Bar has room for about 10 people. There are private tables in the back that seats 4 each."}
{"text":"Was here for my mom's birthday and ordered the tasting menu (Kaiseki). I did my research on Yelp and I sort of knew what to expect, but the experience did not meet my expectation/not worth the $150 per person price.   Most of the dishes tasted great. The ingredients are very fresh and the Sashimi's had the correct balance of fat. The lobster tempura and the Hida Gyu are really good. The hand roll also tasted awesome. However the squid nigiris sushi (imported from Portugal) is extremely tough and is impossible to eat. Had to switch it out at the end. Overall the food is great, better than most of the Jap restaurants I've gone to, but still not perfect. -1 star  The service could be better. The restaurant is very small and there are enough waitress to cover all the customers (we were there pretty early, and the restaurant was only half full), which is why I'm a little disappointed when we had to ask for more tea. The server did a great job explaining each dishes and also the differences between each Sake we ordered in the Sake tasting set. The other complaint I have, which is the main reason for another -1 star is that the first few items on the menu were served way too quick. The server brought us the next dish when none of us have finished the previous one. This happened a few times and we had to ask them to slow down the pace."}
{"text":"I've been a fan since I discovered them while they were still in Scarborough. I can honestly say the sushi is as good as the sushi I've had at tsujiri market in Japan. The price is fair even though it's increased since.moving to Markham but the space is much much nicer than their previous digs.  This is the place to come for authentic Japanese sushi at a reasonable price considering much of the fish is flown from Japan and other parts of the world"}
{"text":"Zen is not only a \"best in category\" (sushi), but also one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto and one of the best values anywhere. The omakase is one surprise after another, with perfect pacing and just an excellent experience all around. Great sake selection, with even the less expensive bottles really enhancing the experience. Chowhounds in the know recommend Zen with good reason: it IS as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Another visit to Zen. Most of the information from my visit from last year is still valid so please take a peek at that one as well. The atmosphere is still not warm and feels very hospital-ish. The fake candles in the entrance corridor were not lit either, which made the atmosphere even colder. Inside the lighting is jarring. Maybe they should put softly glowing (non-fluourescent) lamps on the individual tables. Just do something.  The sushi is still fantastic, but with Aoyama, Toshi, Jabistro and Yasu (and for half the price Hiro, Inaho or Ginko) they are not the only game in town. There were several flaws. Firstly, for the price the quantity is not generous. The hand rolls are now half sized. The uni sushi had little uni, etc. The prices have gone up, the quantity is down and even if the sushi is clearly very very good I could have the same great sushi at half, literally half, the price at the old location. So we are now paying for the location and new interior. Except, the lighting at the new location is like a morgue. I preferred the old interior. The clientele is just nouveau-rich early 20 somethings who are using daddy's credit card feeling important paying $300 to eat something Japanese. Could you go back to the old plaza and reduce your prices again and increase your food's size?? They are not open for lunch so they may be feeling old and a little tired, but at least the time should be used for food preparation, which was a surprise when the entire meal took over 2.5 hours when they have four chefs standing behind the bar.  I had the sashimi omakase and it was great except one chewy fish and emphasis on price not quantity. My friend had sushi special and at $100 was not completely justifiable. Perhaps a la carte is a better price point.  The staff are generally very polite, but not versed in Japanese food and do not even recognize the original words for the sushi. Ask them about a certain item and they are dumbfounded.   Question: \"Do you have shimesaba?\" Answer: \" what-a-saba? what is it??\"  A high end Sushi restaurant needs Japanese waitstaff (in addition to kitchen staff) who understand the food being served. The point is this: if we pay $200 for two people then the waitress should definitely know more about sushi than the average cheap sushi restaurant employee and also know the original names of the pieces.  Again, your experience may be different if you are new to Zen, 20-years old and using daddy's credit card and do not mind speaking Chinese to the waitress, but for someone like me who visited the old place and loves sushi and sashimi this is a disappointment.  I do emphasize that Zen's food is fab and the head chef knows what he is doing so all respect to him, but at these prices we are not regular visitors.  By the way we noticed a manga cafe has opened/has always been next door. It is a future visit for sure.  One last thing which may have been a mistake or a technological problem or another sign of what is happening at Zen: we had called and left a message for a reservation and no one had called us back so we called in again during business hours when someone did answer. They had no record of our message or request for reservation when we did speak with them."}
{"text":"Hidden gem for sure...in a shady part of town!  Definitely one of the best - if not the best - sushi places that I've been to!  Right up there with Yuzu, Japango, Wow Sushi.  Better than Shinobu.  And totally authentic as there were quite a few Japanese patrons, all chefs were also Japanese, as well as staff.  I think I even saw one of the chefs grate wasabi!  No. 9 Sushi Lunch Special, as pictured, was just under $12!  So pretty good value, especially for the quality of the sushi.  Miso had such a rich flavour, as did the salad dressing, and sushi was melt-in-your-mouth!  Sit at the sushi bar for a free education.  ;)  Thanks to fellow yelper, Sami E. for the recommendation.  I finally made it here!  Wish it was closer."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by my sister, according to her it's the 'best Japanese restaurant in toronto'. I ordered the omakase sushi.   I really enjoy the whole omakase experience - the chef would select the freshest fish of the day and would make each piece right in front of you, and will be served piece by piece. The whole thing felt v luxurious.   The sushi were very fresh, my favourite of all was the seared ribbon fish and the o-toro- melts in your mouth in one bite.   As for price, it was around 65 bucks, it's definitely not expensive in relation to its quality.   The restaurant was very kind and offered us a piece of birthday cake as it was a frds bday. The bday cake was a mandarin milk pudding cake, very light and not too sweet. Considering that it was complimentary, it was v nice.   Now on to what i didnt like, i felt that the sushi had way too much wasabi. The first piece had so much wasabi i could barely taste the fish. It just felt like wasabi textured fish with rice. I asked the chef to exclude the wasabi and it was all good from there. Another issue was that there wasnt a hot food selection. A friend cant eat raw fish atm and there was practically NO hot food / cooked food selection except for appetisers, which were v expensive on its own.   Overall i really enjoyed this meal and i thought the omakese set price was v reasonable."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. I didn't think what I ordered was anything special.  I ordered a chirashi which came with miso soup and salad.  The fish was good, but I'm not sure I experience the \"wow\" factor.  The price was definitely reasonable.    For reasonable authentic japanese food (by Japanese) it's pretty good.  But if you are looking for a \"wow\" factor (or a different experience), I don't think you'll find it here."}
{"text":"We have been going to zen for many years now and quality has been very consistent. Be sure to drop by for lunch as their lunch specials are very well priced.  They are one of the few places that grate their wasabi from fresh horse radishes.  The owner/chef and wait staff are all Japanese.  The decor is worn and old but has its charm. I would highly recommend their sushis and rolls, must try their omakase and spider roll.  This restaurant is a gem."}
{"text":"I drove a distance to see the hype of this place. If it was my neibourhood might get some some cheap takeout but not worth the drive."}
{"text":"Zen is back with a whole new store and beautiful decor. We had the omakase sushi course for one, appetizer, chawanmushi & soy icecream and mango jelly. Every course was amazing. The sushi is the star, I love both the fish and the rice. They pay great attention to the rice here. Unfortunately, We had a fish bone in one of our sushi, they apologized and fixed the problem."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Scarborough!  Uni was fresh, the shrimp and scallops were very sweet."}
{"text":"Having heard so much about this place, i did an impromptu drive by with a friend who grew up in Japan - i blindly promised him it would be one of the best in Toronto (and hence worth the drive). After the meal, he agreed that this was true.  Driving into a dark strip mall next to a strip club, you really don't expect this. I walked in on a monday night at 9pm to find the restaurant packed - and everyone was of Japanese/Asian decent (minus the one caucasian guy married to a japanese lady). Good sign?  I think so. It's freshness that wins here. The only other place i've had sushi this good was at Taro's on Sheppherd. I overheard one of the sushi chefs telling someone he's been working sushi for 30+ years.    The prices reflects the quality. It's well worth it."}
{"text":"For the price I paid, the experience was average. Friendly staff. Food was alright. I'd rather go to YASU."}
{"text":"Fish was fresh and service was great. We ordered a couple dishes and dessert a la carte along with the sushi omakase. Great for a birthday or anniversary celebration.  Compared to other omakase places in GTA, zen has more tables for regular dining so it's actually less \"zen\" than some other places.  Nevertheless, the ambiance is nice and the sushi chefs were inviting and friendly."}
{"text":"At first glance you might be worried about this restaurant purely because of its location as it is located in an older industrial strip mall.   Once you open the door everything changes. We did not have reservations but we're able to be seated at the sushi bar. It was actually a very good spot to sit and see everything being made.   This is easily some of the best sushi if not the best sushi I have had in Toronto and I have been to them all.   We went purely for the sushi but ended up getting some apps as well. The tempura was exceptional and so was the soft shell crab.   As for the sushi Wow!! You can tell their fish is super fresh and the preparation is skillful. Aside from the sushi we also got spice tuna rolls. The tuna was prepared to order not like most other restaurants that make it in batches.   Well done we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. A bit on the small side, but the sushi chef(s) are Japanese and know what they're doing. The staff is friendly but service was a little slow. The sushi taste amazing and very fresh. On opening, they were already full and we agreed to wait 45-1 hour to be seated. The actual location of the restaurant is questionable, I wish it wasn't in a bit of a run down area."}
{"text":"Well, i tried the tasting menu which is 125 per person. Two courses were the same with the sushi set plus a soup, black cod and few pieces of sashimi. I expect more, but the tasting menu was just so-sooo. Just skip the tasting menu and order some specials which are worth trying. NOT a big fan of raw fish. The service is good and the ambience, too. It's a hidden gem in markam area after I tried some fake disgusting japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"We tried about 3 times to get to Zen at their old Scarborough location but they were booked solid every time. It wasn't until they moved to their new spot at Woodbine that we managed to get a spot.  Location: It is located in a small strip plaza on the west side of Woodbine. It is very tough to see from the road and the sign is tiny.   Decor: Very minimalist approach to the tables and surrounding which totally fit in with the \"zen\"-like atmosphere. The bar area was more active as people were talking with the sushi chefs.  Food: We ordered the sushi and sashimi omakase meals which included appetizers and dessert. Meal started with a cold shomen noodle which was very tasty. This was followed by a set of 3 mini-apps: miso salmon, unnagi on cucumber salad and steamed egg. Wow - these flavours were great but the portions were a bit on the small side. Next up was the fish - we loved the flavour, freshness and variety of the sushi and sashimi. I always used uni as a my marker of freshness and this one did not disappoint. Tuna, salmon, mackeral and shrimp were wonderful - nice amount of fish with not too much rice. On the sashimi side, portions were generous and the octopus (which I normally find chewy) was soft and tender. Dessert was home made red bean soy ice cream and a fruit jelly.  In general, Zen was a wonderful treat! A bit pricey but well worth the food. We will definitely return and I recommend sitting at the bar as they will serve each piece to you individually!"}
{"text":"I finally made it out to Zen! Unfortunately I never made it out to the old location. New location is beautiful though. I'll keep this short and sweet. The food was delicious. Loved the presentation. The service was great (smiles, explanations of what we were eating & where the fish was from, and it was quick service too - read some reviews of slow or poor service and that simply was not my experience whatsoever). We sat at the bar and ordered two apps and the omakase. Did not disappoint! Only bummer is that there is still no liquor license (although that probably saved me from spending more cash haha)."}
{"text":"The most exquisite sushi restaurant in Toronto. I have been here at least 30 times, however last Saturday my partner and I had the Wagu steak for the very first time...at $120 for a 3.5 oz grade A5 (which is the highest quality you can find) and hands down the most amazing flavour, juices and texture! It really goes to show the level of quality Zen provides. Of course, sushi at the bar only adds to the whole experience but I can't forget the desserts which are prepared by a Japanese chef in the back...the cherry blossom gelatin with black sugar was not only stunning to look at but scrumptious, as well. For those who give negative reviews...Mandarin is a good option!!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent Zen for lunch when it was in Scarborough. Funny now they moved to Markham, which suppose to be in my hood and I only been here for lunch once?!  The decor here definitely more upscale than their older location. The sushi bar area so much more spacious and can fit more customers! I always sit at sushi bar even I am here for lunch and order off the lunch menu.  Service now is more formal with younger wait staff in uniforms. More chic but I kind of missed the older no nonsense  waiter/waitress.  Lunch menu did revamped. I ordered NIGIRI SUSHI ????? ($29.50) and really enjoyed it. Classic with good cut of fish (uni, scallops, fatty tuna, spot prawns) with none of the fusion/torched.  Maybe I would one day come for dinner? They do have Hida Gyu A5  ??? on the menu?!"}
{"text":"This is time to write an update for Zen before they move to their newest location in Markham for Spring 2015.  I have been to Zen numerous time for lunch and every time was an excellent experience.  Since I always come here alone, I definitely suggest to just sit right at the sushi bar. It is so much fun to interact with the chef and watch them prepare sushi like a work of art.  Lunch menu is still great value with the quality and quantity of the food. During lunch, you can also order from the full dinner menu or even their omakase sushi.  I will be coming here for my Japanese food fix whenever I can to tie me over till my next trip to Japan!"}
{"text":"In my opinion the best omakase sushi in Toronto, but you have to sit at the sushi bar. The perfect amount of rice and technique. Lunch omakase is very reasonable at $85 but I love the dessert tray that comes with dinner."}
{"text":"Zen is for real. I've never been to Japan, but I think I came close when I went here last week. I've noticed most Japanese restaurants in Toronto have Korean or Chinese owners, but Zen is the first place I've seen that's been full-on Japanese.  You might be intimidated at first, I mean, it is in a strip mall in the middle of Scarborough, surrounded by similarly sketchy looking businesses. But Zen is the exception. If it were located somewhere more central, no way would they be able to offer such amazing meals for the prices they do.   Zen is not the place to go for a cheap meal, but if you're into sashimi and authentic Japanese food, it will win your heart. I got a chirashi bowl with some of the best cuts of fish I've ever tasted in my life. It came with a soba noodle soup that was seasoned perfectly and turned even more heavenly when they offered me chili powder (love the spice).  Their maki are perfectly rolled, they have the freshest fish I've ever seen, and everything on the menu is exciting and looks delicious. They even have little booths in the back that mock sitting on the floor -- you take off your shoes but your feet hang down instead of sitting cross-legged.  Like I said, this place is the cheapest and easiest way for me to go to Japan (besides Sanko on Queen St.) so I'll be going back often. There seems to be a pretty dedicated lunch crowd, so the closer to noon you arrive, the better."}
{"text":"Shame on you negative reviewers! Someone before me wrote that Zen is a benchmark for sushi in Toronto. They couldn't have been more right.   We were served by an outstanding waitress. The owner and master himself made our sushi. He had a kind smile and a skillful hand. As the night progressed - and sparkling sake was consumed in quantity - his sense of humour shone through - he seemed to like our jokes too!  From the moment we entered the door the experience was 5 star. The table wasn't ready until 810 (8pm reso) but a waitress brought us some complimentary plum wine to pass the time.   We ordered the sushi omakase and two bottles of sake. They were the best we've ever drank! Both cold, one sparkling - the drink menu was explained in detail and both bottles were recommended by our knowledgable and enthusiastic waitress.   The 3 appetizers were ingenious. Three perfectly crafted dishes that surprised and impressed. The ~10 pieces of sushi were lovingly prepared and delivered at the perfect pace. Make sure you reserve a seat at the bar. Take in the skill of these guys and girls. Masters in every sense of the word.   Salmon, tuna, sea bream, shrimp, scallop, yellowtail, firefly squid, fatty tuna hand roll, salmon roe, uni... The Chef asked if he could put the right amount of wasabi in each piece. We said sure! He added some soy. Some citrus rind. Great pickled ginger in between courses.   This was worth every penny spent. Two sushi omakase (3 apps, ~10 pieces, hand roll, and a really great dessert + the complimentary plum wine) left us filled to the perfect level. Actually perfect. The pacing really made it great. Over 2 hours of eating, drinking and admiring the mastery in front of us!   With tax, tip and 2 bottles of great sake - the bill was easily the most we've ever spent on a meal for two, but it was money well spent. The evening was truly memorable and we will be back - after our wallets recover! Don't listen to the others - just book a spot at the counter and enjoy. Make sure you bring someone special who appreciates Japanese cuisine, sake and has a good sense of humour!"}
{"text":"they have better than average sushi but it's just regular stuff,  came here and tried their toro, uni, mackerel which were pretty good.  don't get why it's so uptight, when you go in people are visibly in that \"i'm in this fancy restaurant and i have to act like i have a stick up my ass\" you're in goddamned scarborough in a restaurant thats part of a strip mall with 40% vacancy rate and the empty store next door has broken windows like you're not in the Versailles chill the f out."}
{"text":"Excellent fish! Excellent, authentic Japanese atmosphere!   Yes, it is pricey, but where else can you get authenticity like this?   The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the customer service needs to be faster and more attentive. Tea refills weren't as quick as we had hoped. We had to ask at least 3 times, but when we did ask, it came quickly!"}
{"text":"Authentic sushi, best sushi in the GTA IMO. We sat at the sushi bar and chefs served us his chef selection; it was pricy but worth every penny. Will definitely back even though it's a long drive for us.  The home made mandarin/orange pie/cake dessert was so yummy and light (don't remember the name but its half pie and half cake; house special dessert)"}
{"text":"Surprisingly Underwhelmed.  Was expecting so much more for omakase ($120 for sashimi course)  I regret coming here for number of reasons.   First of all, I believe the amount of food and variety was very limited despite the $120 price tag. There are tons of places out there nowadays in Toronto that goes for half that price with amazing Kaiseki.  Secondly, none of the waiters were Japanese. My fam is Japanese and we expected Japanese service for such a place. The waiter had very limited knowledge in the sushis and she had to go back and ask the chef because she didn't know what type of fish was on the plate. The excuse was \"the menu changes everyday\"...not sure if we take that.  Thirdly, the sashimi was still cold/semi frozen inside (!!! Yes...the biggest no-no if any of you sushi connoisseur know). So finally we decided to complain.  The chef arrived, seemed somewhat unapologetic explaining that the fish all comes fresh never frozen from Spain.  So it may have gotten cold in the centre when it was sitting in the fridge.  ..........and? Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of not ever freezing the fish to get here in the first place?  And are we supposed to accept that as an apology? I don't think so. There definitely was an attitude there. They did say \"so did you want another tuna sashimi then?\" (Super casually) Again, there was a subtle attitude like as if we complained to get free food. we declined.   Overall the food was...okay. Underwhelming. My mom makes better Japanese food to be honest lol the broth was disappointing in both chawanmushi (egg pudding) and the soups.   That experience left a bad taste for us and we definitely will NOT be coming back. Wish I got my money back and ate somewhere else"}
{"text":"One of the better Japanese places in town. Came here a couple of times. Once for their omakase, another for their set meals at both their old and new location. Amazing and impeccable service. Food is prepared very finely, amazing presentation and very fresh seafood. Apparently they fly their seafood in on Thursdays if you're looking to try them when they're the freshest. Would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for some fancy Jap eats."}
{"text":"authentic, great japanese food, no doubt.  i didn't find the ambiance lacking; they do have proper lighting and some type of decor, it's not like it's a hole-in-the-wall place like Tomoe in NYC.  waitresses are super polite, as japanese people are.   listened to my friend's advice and made a reservation for 2 at 1pm on a weekday; turned out the reservation wasn't necessary (maybe it's much needed for dinner time). was deciding amongst a few things, when waitress came and made some recommendations. ordered a chirashi and a sushi special (9 pcs) as she suggested, and made two a la carte sushi orders on top: uni (sea urchin) and anago (sea eel).  my bf's chirashi set came with a udon noodle in soup. the clear broth was sooooo good (close to the sukiyaki taste), we drank it all. my set came with a miso soup and house salad, both of which were on par.  it seems that the chirashi (at least on that day) had a better variety of fish than my sushi; i liked his pieces slightly better than mine.   slightly disappointed by the a la carte orders. the uni was on par but not spectacular (trust me, i've had ones that made me go oooh and ahhh). the anago i've had usually lie fragilely on the rice, trailing on both ends. these two pieces i got here were truncated to match the length of the sushi rice, and i'm not too happy about that.  for dessert, we ordered one order (one scoop) each of green tea and black sesame ice-cream.  the green tea is milky and tasted ok, but i personally prefer the darker ones that have a stronger, slightly bitterish green tea taste. the black sesame, on the other hand, was out of this world. it was dark like squid ink, and every bite was exploding with the aroma of sesame seeds. there were some grind sesame sprinkled on top too, which definitely improved both the flavor and the texture.  total bill came to about $65 for two; not bad for quality sushi at lunch time. however, truth be told, i have had even more superior sushi outside of toronto, and this place is kind of \"in the middle of nowhere\", so it may be a stretch to make this a regular dinner choice (\"regular\" as a visitor). but i AM tempted by their $50/pax omakase menu, so there actually may be a second time the next time i'm in town!"}
{"text":"In case you're not aware... Zen was located in Scarborough prior to moving to their Markham location on Woodbine Ave. I have visited both locations countless times.   This restaurant is now a lot more spacious and comfortable to dine in. The layout and décor is very modern. The sushi bar has about 12 seats and quite a few dining tables, with a few tables tucked behind what seems to be semi-private rooms. It is apparent that a great amount of time and effort was put into the layout and décor of this restaurant. It is a very bright and spacious setting!   Moving onto the food aspect of this newly relocated restaurant. They have a variety of \"seasonal items\" available on a nightly basis and they also have an omakase course (sushi/sashimi) option which includes an selection of appetizers and homemade dessert. This is an option that is newly added to their menu since their relocation. I've tried it a couple of times and I got to admit - it was well worth it! I have also tried the regular sushi omakase course (without the appetizers and desserts) a few times and have been impressed each and every time. The freshness of the fish and how the toro just melts in your mouth - to DIE FOR! And for dessert. Their soy ice cream is a staple on their dessert menu now, together with their mandarin pie! Their desserts are all homemade and I will definitely recommend the soy ice cream! Awesome stuff! I promise! And of course there is the mandarin pie. The only well-known dessert at the old location, this dessert choice still seems to be the lightest of options - this pie is light and fluffy!   In sum... go  try it out if you have never been. Make reservations well in advance. Try their sushi omakase and their soy ice cream!"}
{"text":"After many years of all you can eat Japanese food, I decided to try a more upscale sushi place. Zen did not disappoint. I ordered the sushi meal and it was fantastic! The sushi was very fresh and perfectly made."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my in-laws, food is ok, they are the only two restaurants in North America to provide a specific type of beef. Food again is okay, service was slow, was food so amazing that open my eyes and keep my mouth watering when I am thinking about it? No. the only special is the beef, the beef was the hero here, but couldnt save them all. The beef hot pot was the best, it melts in your mouth, so smooth, doesn't leave any nasty residue in my mouth afterward. Portion was not big, leave me still hungry afterward."}
{"text":"I went here after my friend recommend this place twice. We had the chef special sushi and sashimi, perhaps I was being spoiled with good food? I don't find this special and worth the drive. Sashimi is fresh, the wait for food was so long, we kinda get stuffed into the corner, actually we did. Portion is small, need to order some noodle afterward... And it taste bland."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal zen customer for 15 years since they were located in Scarborough.  When they announced that they were moving to Markham, 10 minutes from my home, I was very excited.  No more long drive to the seedy plaza in Scarborough!!  That excitement quickly subsided when we realized how much has changed in the menu.  No more kitchen entrees ( suitable for my kids who don't yet eat sushi), and only omakase sushi and sashimi available.  Can't go to zen anymore for a reasonably priced nice tokujuo sushi set.  It's now  the full on omakase or nothing.  I felt that this was too drastic a change.  The omakase sushi I had was just as good as it always was in the Scarborough location.  It is very good.  However the filling in the negitoro hand roll was too cold, which did not allow me to fully taste the fish's richness.  A shame, and disappointing.  The service has always been slow at zen, but before I could tolerate it given the excellent value for money.  Now, not so much.  The make the maître d was not particularly pleasant either (he never has been).  I also miss the more intimate decor of the old place, with lower ceilings, smaller more rustic sushi bar, and white table cloths.  The new place looks nice and modern, but lacks warmth.  It's not inviting.  It feels generic, like they hired the same decorators that do decorate places like your local congee queen.  All in all, if they had kept their original menu, everything else would be tolerable, even the price increase.  I can tell you I would be there once a week if they would have just kept the original menu intact, since the place is now so close to my home.  But they've changed their focus, and are no longer interested in causal diners looking for good sushi.  It's strictly now a \"special occasion\" restaurant.  The only thing is that at the prices they are now charging, there are a lot of other choices that offer better service and atmosphere.  So I'm not sure their change in direction was a good decision.  Time will tell...  As for me, I'm on the lookout for a decently priced authentic sushi place.  It's hard to find.  There is hope however - the old location I heard is opening under a new owner.  And also heard that Jackie Lin is opening his own place later this year.  I will definitely be there checking it out!!!"}
