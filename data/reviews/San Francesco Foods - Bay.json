{"text":"I just happened to be in the neighbourhood, and came across this place at just the moment I was feeling hungry and looking for a place to eat. It was perfect timing because this place turned out to be great! I had never heard of it and wouldn't have been looking for it otherwise...   The inside is clean and modern and very welcoming. It's a fast-casual joint, so you order at the counter and they call you when it's ready. I ordered a Chicken Parmesan sandwich, and it was delicious. Also, this sandwich was MASSIVE!!! Seriously, it could feed two people. It's really that big! I took a pic of it, but I'm not sure you can really judge the size from that.  Anyway, the sandwich was great tasting, and reasonably priced (especially for the portions they serve). Also, the service was friendly, if slightly slow. It took awhile for the order to come out, but I'm assuming that means it's cooked to order, which is a good thing! I will definitely return when I'm in the area..."}
{"text":"IT SHOULD BE  A CRIME TO SELL THAT GARBAGE PIZZA.  (ITS BURNT,OLD LOOKING ,AND MADE ME BARF).   Honestly the sandwiches are ok.  but.  i will never forgive this restaurant for serving horrible pizza.  i ordered one slice of pepperoni.  it took a really long time to warm up.  by the time i get it it is completely black on the bottom and hot as hell.  i proceeded to burn my mouth and finish the disappointing meal before going back to work.  where i later suddenly felt the need to vomit. EVERYWHERE.  it was the worst mess i have ever made in my work place. it was embarrassing and left me feeling like a sad fool.   it didnt even taste good.  ruined my day.  EAT AT OWN RISK / GO SOMEWHERE ELSE"}
{"text":"Good veal sandwiches but seems like the service at THIS LOCATION is always at its WORST.  I called in ahead of time to place an order for the veal sandwich as they always awhile to prepare. I kindly asked what the the available additional toppings were, but the server did not bother to response, only rudely to tell me to check through the online ordering menu. I told him I was in a hurry but he could not help and hung up immediately.   Going through the 3rd party websites on my phone was so much hassle through the FLASH and LAG of the poor websites. I was urgently in a hurry and did not have the time nor patience to search for the toppings. I called back and ordered with the simple toppings I knew from the past.      When I arrived the store, it was empty- not busy at all. The sever working at the cash was the same guy working in the kitchen and likely the same guy that took my call earlier. 15 minutes since my call, the sandwich was still not ready...   This isnt the first time I noticed they were short of staffs.....  After paying for my order first, I caught the server preparing my sandwich WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS. I was irritated and told him he should follow the sanitary rules - he apologized and just gave me a blank stare. No offer for a new sandwich.. I should demanded it but would not stand to wait any longer and just wanted to get the f*** out as i was urgently late. I placed an order 15 minutes ago and wasted another 15 minutes waiting.   Looking at the receipt, the SERVER NAME was KIRAN (Middle Eastern boy with glasses)  I was really pissed off, let me tell you.. I will never be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"They have a $8.50 special right now for a large cheese or pepperoni pizza. Decided to try it out because I have had too much Pizza Pizza from school functions. Good deal. Fairly thin crust, made to order, adequate pepperoni to cheese ratio. Took 25 minutes to make though, which I think is rather long if the ingredients are not frozen...and no one else was in the store. Crust had maybe too much cornmeal dusted on it, and was too charred for my liking. Added an undesirable bitter taste. Overall, I wouldn't call it a gourmet pizza but it's not bad if you need a pizza fix.   I've heard that the fried panzerottis are pretty good so I may try one next time.  UPDATE: Management is very open to customer feedback which is awesome :) I will try the pizza again!"}
{"text":"I guess this place is known for their sandwiches because the lasagna I had was far too salty for my liking. A lot of sauce in the takeout container. The garlic bread was like a big hamburger bun and it too was very salty. Over all, ya I've had better."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mad Italian pulled pork sandwich ($7.99) and fries ($3.75). I just realized their website lists the pulled pork sandwich as $7.50. Oh well.  The sandwich is quite big, but you soon realize that most of its size comes from the bread. It's a lot of bread. It's not toasted or warm or anything, which was disappointing because I feel like it affected the temperature of the ingredients inside and it would've made the sandwich much better.   I ordered the pulled pork thinking it'd be the juiciest based on my experience with pulled pork in general. It wasn't as juicy as I would've liked it to be. I also like my pulled pork to have a good mix of meat and fat, but maybe that's just me. Flavour-wise, it was pretty good. I'm not super impressed and I feel like they could've packed in more flavour, but it was tasty.   The box of fries looked small, but it was a lot. I was exploding after finishing everything.  The restaurant itself is pretty nice. It's not too cramped and there's a fair amount of seating, both tables and window-facing bench/bar seats.  They have some coupons for a free pop with the purchase of a sandwich at the counter, so take a look down before ordering and use one."}
{"text":"Love these sandwhiches, better than most fast food esque Italian sandwhiches joints.! I appreciate their breading most cause it has lots of flavour.   Compatibly to California sandwhiches their chicken is a bigger meatier piece.  ! So this is a great place for a quick and meaty bite."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were very excited for San Francesco to open as we live in the condo above them. Walking in, the resturant was clean and looked similar to their other franchises in  the city. We ordered the Panzerotti and their famous Veal sandwhich... and let me just say, it was delicious!  For the Panzerotti, we had the classic pepperoni and cheese and added additional sausage to it. The ingredients tasted super fresh and they were definitely generous with their portion size (I could only finish half!) The owner also offered us a sample of his tomato sauce and it went really well with the Panzerotti  For the Veal sandwhich, it was meaty and delicious! I only had a couple bites but my boyfriend said it was probably one of the best ones he has ever had! If you think California Sandwhiches are good... then you must try this one! If you like the mushroom, add the extra mushroom for 75 cents, it definitely is worth your while!  We also were fortunate to try their home made gelato. A little sample of each flavour and we must say, coconut was our fav! Never was a big fan of coconut until we had this.  Overall, this place willl be dangerous to have them so close by since I'll always want to go! Can't wait to go back and try more items from their menu"}
{"text":"Pretty run of the mill crappy sandwich shop. Bae's parents ate here 35 years ago and apparently, it was good back then. Now, it's garbage. Not worth a trip, go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I mean don't get me wrong, the chicken sandwich was massive and tasty (I put jalape√±os, mushrooms, and onion,  however it didn't have much tomato sauce, if not any. The tomato sauce is crucial in the construction of a chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Hands down the best veal sandwich in the city.. Better than California sandwiches. Huge portion with lots of veal. You can get additional toppings - i usually get mushrooms, crispy eggplants and provolone. If you're taking it to go, might be a good idea to ask for the sauce on the side because the sandwich can get a bit soggy if you don't eat it at the resto :) friendly service too!!"}
{"text":"I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, and one extra star.  Their main thing, the veal sandwich is horrendous.  It is a huge bun + tomato sauce + processed breaded shoe soles.  No meat. Why is it $9? And if you want to add ingredients, you have to pay for each.   So for $9 I got a bunch of bread and breadcrumbs, ugh.  Go to Subway instead, for $9 you can pick any ingredient you want,  and some of Subway's meat tastes better than insoles.  Maybe the pulled pork or the steak sandwiches are a bit better, I do not know, but avoid the veal sandwich."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are mediocre and take long to prepare. I like that they're big and filling, but my biggest complaint though is the cost of the toppings. $0.49 for a tomato... one, single tomato slice. Really? The sandwich is expensive as it is. If you're going to charge so much for toppings, give a reasonable amount. Same with the zucchini. $0.99 for one slice. Once you put one or two toppings and include a drink, your lunch just became overpriced."}
{"text":"I walked in around 12pm, and the place was completely empty.  Ordered their veal sandwich and the counter guy asked what toppings I wanted.  I looked at the list and it seems that they charge for every single type of topping.  I got just the mushrooms, and I really got just the veal and mushroom in my sandwich.    Service was fast, and they whipped up that sandwich in under 5 mins.  It came out to $9 for just the sandwich with mushroom.  It's just not worth it.  The sandwich was mediocre at best.    I'd recommend the Pizza Pizza joint across the street over this place.  The only upside is the atmosphere is an upgrade from Pizza Pizza and it looks like they have a few gelato flavours available."}
{"text":"very disappointed with the service,  we couldn't even get a plastic  knife from the manager who was at the counter, because she was too busy doing her paperwork. the sandwich buns were very dry, my eggplant parmigiano was very thin. from the time we walked in, it took them 10 minutes to a knowledge us."}
{"text":"Not sure if this is new, but I didn't notice it on my last trip to T.O.   I had the pulled pork. It was, to use a technical term, huge. I remarked upon its girth at when I bought it and again the next night when I had the other half for dinner. It was just as good the second time, so bonus points because it kept well. It would have benefitted from a little bit more sauce. Not sure what size included coleslaw is because I didn't order it, but if it is commensurate with the size of sandwich then you'll want to share with a friend or a gargoyle (assuming that your gargoyle eats pork, as mine does).  Super friendly service. The guy wasn't being nice just to angle for tips because the tip jar was not close to the customer's side of the counter and it was turned away. I wasn't even sure if I was supposed to leave a tip because of where the tip jar was but after the guy went out of his way to come over to ask me if I enjoyed the sandwich I decided to turn the tip jar around and put some cash in it.  They offer premium Italian soft drinks including Aranciata and Brio.  Really reasonable prices. The pulled pork and the pop came to a little over nine dollars."}
{"text":"I cannot believe this chain all of their stores. Destroy deal on a bun. They deep fry it it taste like a big french fry.The original family sold in the late 80s they didn't have the prayers everything will pan fry it in olive oil. Why would you ruin such a delicate piece of meat Bye deep frying.I was so disappointed or used to love that place course it was only on Clinton in college and then we would go to the Monarch tavern and eat it"}
