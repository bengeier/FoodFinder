{"text":"Tried this place last night when visiting Pickering Town Centre.  The lady was super nice and greeted me with samples - butter chicken with rice. In the end I opted for the Chicken Tikka with briyani rice, salad and a naan for $9.99.  It took some time to make because they grill it fresh so the wait is worth it.  It tasted amazing for food court Indian food. The chicken was moist, cooked perfectly and the spices in the rice and chicken harmonized well.  I will def. be back to try the afghan dishes."}
{"text":"I was there last week and agree with Adele.  It's a very nice family operated business that was very helpful in choosing food that I was not too familiar with.  Very tasty.  HUGE portions.  For lunch I was stuffed.  Give these people and their homemade food a try.  Four Yums."}
{"text":"Wow. I found this little kebab shop in the Pickering Town Centre food court today. They offer both Indian and Afghan dishes. As we stepped up to the counter we were presented with a sampling of butter chicken over rice and was it ever good!  For our lunch today though, we both opted for an Afghan dish. I went with the BBQ Chicken Kebab and my husband decided on the Adana Kebab.   I was amazed at how full of flavour and tender the chicken was. Needless to say, that beautiful Afghan rice did not disappoint either.   The kebab my husband got reminded me more of a gyros in flavour and was really good!  Both dishes came with rice and salad with these excellent crispy 'croutons' on top.   The service was quick and friendly and I must say, although I'm giving them an overall rating of 4-star... for a food court restaurant they're definitely a 5-star!!  I will be back to try more dishes for sure! So glad we stopped here today."}
