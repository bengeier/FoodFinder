{"text":"If it isn't past midnight, don't come to Antoon's. A $4.90 large cheese pizza is great at 3 AM after a night of fun but there are much better pizza options during the day. It's a small establishment and it's carry out and cash only."}
{"text":"Better than sorrentos and care about the pitt community which is why I want to keep them in business, serving pitt students the best pizza in Oakland"}
{"text":"Even with the low rating, this is the only place I get pizza from in Oakland. It's just sort of like a tradition; no other pizza shop can compete with the Antoon's large plain pie for less than 5 dollars.  Get the garlic crust. It's not on the menu, but they'll prepare your crust with some extra spices and flavors which makes you think you're eating something delicious instead of cheap."}
{"text":"Antoon's Pizza is the perfect ending to a night out. On any given week i probably have 2 to 3 boxes of Antoon's Pizza in my kitchen from myself or from having friends over. It's everything a college kid wants after going to the bars: Cheap, quick, greasy, and delicious. For $5 you can get a large cheese pizza and feed yourself and maybe two others depending on the crowd you're with. For those out-of-towners or those unfamiliar with how cheap Antoon's actually is, you become the hero of the night for feeding everyone, and you hardly spent a dime. Highly recommended for any college kid on a budget, and for anyone who for some reason goes to Sorrento's and doesn't know the magic of Antoon's."}
{"text":"Great Pizza for $5. Let's be very clear, there are a bunch of 2 star reviews, that wanted gourmet pizza for $5 and were shocked to find out that extra cheese and pepperoni were extra. When evaluating a place you have to take the service in consideration to the price. If you want a better pizza, you can ask for extra cheese, pepperoni, garlic crust, etc. and still walk out with a large pizza for roughly $7.50, which is well under the $10-$15 you would spend at a major chain. I also regularly get their cheese sticks and cheese steak hoagie."}
{"text":"Great pizza wait for it......when your near broke or drunk or both. And it is open late on weekends, always a plus."}
{"text":"Got to be one of the best pizza's in Pittsburgh.  They make the pizzas right in front of you and for 6$ you get a huge pizza and the toppings are 1.5$ . We usually got two toppings and the bread and cheese are an absolute delight.. Highly recommended for lovers of thin crust pizzas. The only inconvenience is they don't have a place to sit anywhere close, so you need to go either to the UPitt canteen place which have a few seats outside or to the park to have a nice view along with the meal..."}
{"text":"The best pizza at the University of Pittsburgh. Cheap pies that are phenomenal in taste. Well worth the parking hassle to get this pizza. I've never had a bad pizza here!!"}
{"text":"not too sure how drunk works but i think my tastebuds work just the same no matter how drunk i am. with that said i wish there was hand sanitizer after the nights of debauchery followed by antoon's pizza. 5 bucks is great for a cheese pizza no matter what. The dough isnt super gluten-y, its got a good crunch to it but still soft and fluffy on the inside. random tip: powdered sugar on the pepperoni is so good- so what if the pizza is $6.50? you'll be smiling all night, its so good.   btw twins work there! one is much cuter than the other =D"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza for $5 for a large cheese (fresh dough and a decent amount of cheese) ... So much better than little caesars $5!!!!"}
{"text":"$6 for a large cheese pizza and open until 2:00 AM. (Anyone remember when it used to be $5?!)  I found myself here after a friend's 21st spent getting her horns at Peter's Pub. It was a Sunday, other bars were closed, Sorrento's, and Mcdonalds were too!  Pitt students will have their biases to either Antoon's or Sorrento's, but I'll let you be the judge of that.. their pies are the same price. It was an awfully cold winter night, so I could complain about the no seating from Antoon's, but their extremely fast service makes up for it. If it weren't so cold outside, that pizza wouldn't have lasted our walk to our dining spot as we probably would have eaten it on the spot.  Don't forget the ranch."}
{"text":"5 dollar college pizza.  This place is the best. The originator of the $5 Oakland Pizza.  It's a solid pie that is good for a quick dinner or great for a late night food after some South Oakland Activities.  If you want some extra attention to your pizza get a topping or the garlic crust and it comes out even better for just a little bit more!"}
{"text":"Go in late night, tell them you already ordered and they will sling you a pizza on the spot.  These guys are solid, it's a shame nobody tips them more than their spare change.  Don't recommend while sober, but take it home late night with some ranch and hot sauce."}
{"text":"For $5 a pie, how bad can it be?  Great for the price, although I think it's not as good as Domino's or Papa John's.  I used to order mass amounts from this place for Student Dorm Council meetings at CMU."}
{"text":"Late night pizza is a staple of the South Oakland nightlife culture. Offering a $6 dollar pie in just minutes, Antoon's pizza is Pitt's superior late night za. What the business lacks in seating, it more than makes up for in the quality of it's pizza. I won't go to say that Antoon's is the best available pizza in Oakland, but it's the greatest bang for you buck.  Antoon's pies feature a doughy crust and a smooth, lightly spiced sauce. The medium thin crust is very well balanced with the proportion of sauce added to the pie. The cheese mixture is done well, and does not puddle with grease like the joint's next door pizza competition.  Obviously, some people prefer the ability to sit down in a restaurant to eat their pizza after a night on the town, but if you're a true pizza connoisseur, the quality of pie at Antoon's will win you over each time.  Note: The four star rating I gave to this restaurant does not match with my direct review of the actual food, but for the quality of experience for the price you pay!"}
{"text":"Antoons sucks. It's just a shit dough pizza wit butt ass cheese and zero sauce. I don't care that it's $5. Id rather spend that $5 on a Red Baron than eat this garbage pie"}
{"text":"Top late-night cheap pizza in Oakland; good pizza any time of the day. And that's the truth, Ruth."}
{"text":"$6 for a large cheese pizza is the best, day and night. The only downside in the Sorrento's/Antoon's debate is that Antoon's Ranch is a little off, but their pizza is amazing. Solid amount of cheese, and not terribly greasy."}
{"text":"Speaking truthfully, I have never been here sober, but they do have great, cheap pizza ($4.90 for a large cheese pizza!!!!) - while it is hot that is. Like a hangover, this pizza is not something you want to deal with the next morning. It curls up and is not really edible. But great pizza when you are wasted."}
{"text":"10pm-2am   best pizza of my pittsburgh life 6pm-10pm   pour garlic powder generously and its still good. at any hour, the guys that work there are some of the nicest people I've met in oakland.  tip: ask them to cut the pizza into just two pieces, cover it in garlic powder, then eat it like there's no tomorrow."}
{"text":"Large cheese pizza $6.00 plus AWESOME! Pizza is actually very good and can't beat the deal. Will definitely be going there every time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Most definitely college quality.  Look for cheap eats, here you go. Had two slices of pizza, pepperoni and mushroom. Not a fan of can mushrooms."}
{"text":"You only come here for one reason....the $5 large cheese pizza. It's carry out only and anyone who lives within a 4 block radius of this place knows all about this.   The pizza isn't that great but if it's midnight, you're piss drunk and need some food....this is where you come."}
