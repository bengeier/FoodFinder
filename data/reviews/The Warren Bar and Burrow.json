{"text":"Amazing new location on 7th Street! I had the Miso Salmon Sandwich and a friend had the Crab and Bacon Grilled Cheese- both were amazing! We also had cocktails that were incredible! Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"Went here after work for a drink.  Felt like an after thought.it felt cold and uninviting.  Bartender spent more time checking their phone than tending bar."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and think the food is terrific. The cost of approximately $20 for a sandwich and side is a bit high but maybe not out of line for a downtown location. The booths are ridiculously small and uncomfortable. That the kitchen doesn't open til 5 on the weekends is just dumb. The serving of soft drinks in cans is downright ghetto. This place has tremendous potential but many things need a re-think."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, lamb lollipops, frog  legs, wings, crab and bacon grill cheese  at fair a
 price.."}
{"text":"Congrats to Spencer. He is THE hardest working bartender I know, and just very talented. Always been a fan of his.

The drinks are clean and concise which is very important, because I am niether"}
{"text":"Good new happy hour spot! Their signature drinks are specialty crafted cocktails that are delicious and refreshing. I ordered A Stone's Throw and really enjoyed the acidic, fruity flavor. As far as food, there isnt a specific appetizer menu; however, the sides menu and wings are good portions for sharing. We ordered the Buffalo Cauliflower, Honey Sriracha wings, and fries. The cauliflower was so delicious we ended up ordering a second plate. The wings were good, I would have liked more sauce on them and a crisper outside though.  Atmosphere of the restaurant, gives off a speakeasy feel, which I found interesting. Service was friendly, but it took a little while to get our drinks after ordering them. To be fair it was very crowded, they have recently opened, and the drinks needed to be crafted."}
{"text":"This is a fun little joint with amazing service and drinks for as busy as it gets.  Their bartenders are hard working and terrific mixologists.  It's great for a specialty drink before the theater or show nearby in the Cultural District.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent cocktails, knowledgeable bartender, great atmosphere. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's the kind of place where nobody bothers you. Great drinks, dimly lit, and unassuming. You could walk by and not realize this place is even there. Do stop in, their manhattan is delicious!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I should put this review under Penn Cove or The Warren. It is an interesting relationship.  I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for happy hour. I loved it. 

It is tough to tell what it is when you walk in (Bar? Restaurant? Both?), where to go, and if it is open (the windows are really dark, it looks closed). I'd suggest adding some signage, a hostess, and an open sign to help with some of this so people get in the door. Because it is great!!!!

The cocktail list is great (though could be more descriptive as to what alcohol is in each drink--I don't want to have to ask), the beer list is also pretty good, and the wine options are amazing. I stuck to cocktails both times and they were strong and well-balanced. I got The Cat's Meow (think Jamaica) and one I can't remember the name for that involved apricot and lime. The Warren food list looked really great, and what other patrons ordered smelled amazing. But, but both times I went with Penn Cove sushi. I like that you can get sushi or something more standard. Great for folks like me who know lots of anti-sushi folks. The sushi is the time-proven Penn Ave Fish Co- it won't disappoint. 

The bartenders/staff are super friendly. I hope people fill this place up because it is really a cool space with great drinks/food.  I'll be back, often."}
{"text":"Craft cocktails? check

Sushi? check

Two of my favorite things in ONE location? I'm moving in. 
 
I absolutely adore The Warren and can't quite get enough of it.  It's quickly moved to the top of my list of places to meet friends downtown and recommend to out-of-towners.  The adjoining Penn Cove provides the delicious, unparalleled sushi that graces the bar menu, and if you're even remotely familiar with the fine offerings from Penn Avenue Fish Company, I needn't say more.  

They're also slinging some epic cocktails here, and the menu rotates frequently to keep things interesting.  Cocktails are offered by flavor profile, so rather than pigeonholing yourself into drinks only containing vodka, rum, etc., pick something that sounds good to you based on the flavors alone!  Bubbly citrus? Got it.  Strong and spicy? Done.  That being said, if you're looking for something specific, the skilled bartenders here will fix you up quite nicely.  My personal recommendation? Order a negroni from Jimmy - you're welcome.

The atmosphere here is chill and comfortable, though it tends to get busy with the post-work crowds. Regardless of what the crowd is (or isn't like), I have yet to see it impact the service or quality here. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a Spicy Senorita roll calling my name."}
{"text":"Had dinner and drinks before a show. Nice, cozy atmosphere. Good food, great drinks and wonderful service."}
{"text":"Solid. The cocktail menu was a little confusing because it described the experience, rather than list the ingredients, but the bartender was happy to help me navigate my dairy allergy. Everything was tasty, including the sushi roll we had for snack."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in tonight for a cocktail. My first issue (and biggest issue) was the fact that there was no whiskey list. I was told, \"ask the guy in the vest what he recommends.\" I ordered a Blanton's on the rocks and my lady friend got an Old Fashioned. The Blanton's was way overpriced (which I would have known had there been a list). The Old Fashioned was too sweet. The vibe was weird. The crowd was weird and the lightning was weird."}
{"text":"What an incredible establishment to be added to our downtown neighborhood. This long in a weighted restaurant and Watering Hole will wake up the neighborhood once again on Liberty and 7th. Penn Avenue Fish Company collaborating with the Warren will be an amazing addition and Eatery for the residents and businesses downtown. More to come in my review as I frequent this neighbor!! Congratulations to the whole team that put this together. We've been waiting for you to open!!!

Check out the cocktail list and my dear friend Raelynn from Dish who's now calling The Warren her new home creating amazing libations. 

The sushi rolls were the best of the bunch from Penn Avenue Fish Company and adding some new dishes that I can't wait to try such as the lamb popsicles. Those were amazing!"}
{"text":"I want to love this bar because it's in a convenient location, but the drinks are expensive and the bartenders are inattentive. When they're not ignoring you, they're being downright rude to you."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for the first time last night- this place is our new favorite hidden gem of Pittsburgh!  If you don't look you'll miss it- seated right next to the Benedum Center.  Fabulous drinks -especially the Toki Highball.  We had already done a full dinner elsewhere- but wanted to try some new drinks and the Penn Cove sushi (food by Penn Avenue Fish and drinks by the Warren, but serves Penn Fish food).  Totally hit the spot- and the service was excellent- Jimmy, Courtney and Raylin are rockstars.  The great music, the top-notch service and the overall vibes of the Warren ensures that we will going back very, very soon."}
{"text":"We came in for sushi and they were out unfortunately BUT the food we had was amazing. The buffalo cauliflower is unbelievably delicious - has a good crust. My boyfriend also had the \"A Hair of the Dog\" hot dog that had guacamole and a fried egg and he loved it. AND they have AMAZING cocktails. Also our waitress was super nice!"}
{"text":"Have been walking by this place and finally tried it. My cocktail was delicious and loved the environment. It was a warm day so they had the windows open and a nice breeze. The music was a little loud (but we may have been sitting next to the speaker) so it was hard to hear the other person talking. Will definitely be trying more of their menu!"}
{"text":"The bar is very small and incredibly crowded. Yes it has a cool hipster vibe to it, but it's hard to see what that is when the barstools are all taken and it's more than a little dark inside.

My companion and I had only one drink each; partially because of the prices, partially because of the crowd. I paid $10 for my can of beer; which granted, was a nice raspberry Hefeweizen. He paid $10 for his cocktail which was a tiny little thing; though delicious.

Personally, I'd rather go to any number of other bars down the street that are a little less crowded and the same cost but larger sizes of beverages."}
{"text":"The cocktails here are great! I tried the Faust Pact and the Diablo and both were awesome.  No happy hour specials (yet) which is a little disappointing for a downtown bar, but the cocktails are pretty reasonable at $10 and the quality is primo.  

We also got a side a fries to much on and omg they were GREAT!! Simple fries, but perfect crisp on the outside, tender on the inside. 

The ambiance is relaxed and staff is friendly.  This may be my new favorite downtown spot!"}
{"text":"Cocktails might be the best in downtown Pittsburgh. I had 2 diablos and another special of the eve. FYI- \"specials\" are specially tasty, but not specially priced. At least as of the date of my visit, there were no happy hour deals. If any cocktail is worth $10, though, these are. The food was also pretty good (I had the grilled cheese with crab). 

The space is fairly small and filled up quickly -- even as a relatively new open, its a popular spot. Four of us sat in a booth. We were comfy but it was tight."}
{"text":"One of the best new cocktail bars around!  Needs a happy hour but otherwise wonderful.  Everything is made with such craft and care.   Great sushi and sandwiches too!"}
{"text":"Pros:

Penn Cove burger was so juicy
The chicken sandwich was well-seasoned and delicious
The fries are amazing - crispy outside and fluffy inside
Cocktails were served in fun and kitschy holiday-themed cocktail glasses
Great location in the heart of the theater district
Our server was very friendly
Great outside seating for people watching

Cons:

No happy hour specials"}
{"text":"I'm in love with The Warren! I know it is newer to downtown and I must say they are doing something right! My boyfriend and I stopped in on a Thursday night for my birthday and had a wonderful experience. It wasn't that busy so we had no problem walking in and grabbing a booth by the large open windows which was perfect because it was a warm night. This is a small intimate setting so I wouldn't come with a large group, perfect for date night. The vibe was pretty laid back and chill with hip decor. The service was great. Our waitress was very attentive and kept checking on us. The food also came out pretty quickly. I absolutely love the menu here. One side has sushi rolls and the other has a variety of other foods such as a burger, fish and chips, salad. So there is definitely something for everyone. The sides are awesome too. They are perfect to get as an appetizer. We had the hush puppies and buffalo cauliflower. Both were fab. The buffalo cauliflower was bomb.com. I honestly thought I was eating boneless wings. We also had the sushi and I must say it may be my new favorite in the city, very fresh! I most certainly will be returning! Delicious food with a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Visited on a Monday at 5:30 PM with two girlfriends. The place is small but only had a few other patrons. The interior is well done and helps to establish the place as a unique spot with a distinct look & feel. Cool color scheme and interesting lighting.  It does feel like a slightly more modern version of a traditional English pub. That is reflected in a few of the menu items - but then there is also a large selection of sushi and creative drinks. 

Our waitress was attentive, popped in often to check in on us. Answered my questions on the drinks and provided a good recommendation when I said I wanted something sweet. It was a girls night so we did take a bit to decide on the menu. She didn't seem annoyed with us.

I enjoyed my drink it was refreshing - described on the menu as AMARO'S A DAY AWAY cherry / herbal / fizzy. 

The Fish and chips very crispy and light. The pub chips are impressive and have a nice crisp without an oily taste! The fish is fishy though if you are'nt into that you will probably notice it!

I also tried a bit of my friends sushi and the buffalo cauliflower. Both were well done and enjoyable. If you are a buffalo cauliflower fan I would encourage you to seek this app out here, its definitely light and flavorful without being greasy. 

Interesting that this new spot doesn't have any signage outside - hard to tell what the space is from the outside. Also disappointing that there are no reservations, happy hour deals and or daily specials."}
{"text":"We had a great time! Ordered buffalo wings, hush puppies, and sweet potato fries for our bar snacks. The cocktails are a great price for downtown, at $10 a drink. We also stopped next door and purchased a bottle of wine to go, they have really interesting selections!"}
{"text":"Spencer has done it again! What an amazing spot and location on 7th downtown. 
It goes without saying how fab the cocktails are and they're affordable!! Just ten bucks!
The Cloven Hoof is a drink I highly suggest; its tasty and refreshing with a nice hint of vanilla.
The decor is so relaxing and comfortable with a beautiful bar, artwork and decent seating. I love the open windows for the indoor/outdoor entertaining vibe.
I haven't eaten here yet but there's no doubt that will be equally as good. I'll update once I've had a bite.
Wanted to be able to pop in and have one of his infamous cocktails and did so during lunch when there were just two guys at the bar.
Everyone needs to experience this latest Warren venture!"}
{"text":"Love this bar! It looks super snooty from the outside, but inside, the service is super friendly, the cocktail offerings amazing and the music playlists are super chill! Met the owner while waiting in line to use the restroom, and he was very down-to-earth and a happy individual. Will definitely be returning to try more cocktails. Thanks, Warren!"}
