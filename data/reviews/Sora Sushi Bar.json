{"text":"Sora Sushi is a take-out /delivery sushi restaurant that leaves me always satisfied (despite my SEA FOOD allergies) and always coming back for more!

They were very accommodating and understanding of the allergies along with offering tasty allergy friendly constitutions. It was pleasant surprise not to get hit with a huge substitution surcharge bill as well.

The delivery was under the estimated time, and on top of all the proper fixings and cutlery accounted for, there was 2 miso soups as well (complementary) :D 
Our delivery guy was the owner/chef. He was extremely nice, and very friendly. 

I've ordered sushi from there many times now, and have always been very pleased. They sushi is always fresh and nicely prepared. They have accommodated my allergies to seafood and have continued to by preparing it prior to handling fish products and packaging in separate containers! 

Would defiantly order from here again if I am in the mood for sushi!"}
{"text":"I have frequented this restaurant for 15 years now and it is still my favourite sushi restaurant.  In all these years, I've never had an issue with my order and they are always willing to customize my orders if needed.  My favourite is the spicy salmon maki but the salmon sashimi is always fresh and delicious.  Love them!!"}
{"text":"Tiny mom and pop shop. Very cute and quality of food definitely beats the big restaurants. I would recommend it. The miso soup was very flavorful!! They also have lunch specials. We got the Mushi lunch special as in picture $9"}
{"text":"Best sushi, and run by two of the nicest people (Husband and wife) you could ever meet. If you want quality sushi, rolls that stick together instead of falling apart (and are huge!), and sushi that will have you drooling and coming back for it again and again - this is the place for you!!!

Newly renovated too, the dining area is absolutely adorable!!! This is my favourite and my family has been coming for years. Also having been to Japan, I can say that this is the closest it gets to what I have experienced there :)"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I have ever had. Would go more often, but I don't go to Mississauga much anymore. The rice is always perfect and the other ingredients (fish/shrimp/veggies) are always freshly prepared for the rolls. It's tiny inside but the owners are very nice. The prices are also insanely cheap and they offer great combos for quick takeout. Delicious food and friendly small business owners at an excellent value."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I love coming here for sushi.
First time we came, we were greeted with smiles from the family & asked how we heard of them (urbanspoon). 
Their sushi rice is marinated in their sauce which gives the sushi extra flavor. The portions are also very big so I'm always full when I leave.
I used to HATE miso soup but after trying it here... I am addicted. They're miso soup is home made, which  makes it more delicious. 
The son, I think Sam is his name, is such a delightful person to talk to. Always keeps me company while I wait for my fresh suhsi...and he always remembers me and my husband when we come in.
Highlllllly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really nice food. The order (40 rolls) took over 40 mins to come out unfortunately. When we asked for water, we recieved only one glass for the two of us. 

Overall: really good food, good price, but not satisfactory in terms of customer service. 

If I were to come back, it would be for takeout."}
{"text":"I saw this place had great reviews on Urbanspoon so we decided to check it out. Within minutes we had to leave. I didn't even want to put my purse down it was so dirty. The florescent light above us was flickering and the menus were sticky and gross. The atmosphere was awkward and quiet, there was no music or noise.

I almost wanted to let the owners know why we were leaving without ordering but I chickened out and we left when their backs were turned."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi! The quality of the rice is great and you can taste the freshness! I ordered the beef teriyaki lunch special and the salmon sushi pizza, both were great! Although their spicy mayo is spicier than other places I've tried.

Decent place for some good quality rolls!"}
{"text":"Such a great family run sushi place. Definitely a small place with limited seating but they have great take out. I have been going here for close to 9 years now and I have never been disappointed. Their dynamite roll is honestly like none other - it is a must try! I really do not know what else makes it taste so good other than the ingredients themselves being fresh. I cannot hype this place up any more!"}
{"text":"I'm a sushi newb but I have been trying various sushi joints lately. I never knew this place actually existed and I have lived in the area for years, I always thought UMI was the most accessibly joint. For cheap takeout sushi this place is a good one. There is very little seating in the restaurant so keep that in mind. I only tried the vegetarian rolls. They were fine in my book. If you need a sushi fix and live in the city centre area, I would try this place! The service was fast and the owners were friendly."}
{"text":"Quality, service, and a great Japanese vibe. The young guy working there was friendly and gave my buddiescand I some suggestions and was very patient with us. We got the food platter and it was quality rolls and shashimi. Loved the unagi and salmon.    

Personally this is the reason I don't like ayce sushi. 

If you foodies out there want that foreign Japanese vibe with good service and quality food. come here. 

mind you it's a small place.  Probably seats 7-8 people max."}
{"text":"Round 2 incase it was a fluke. nope, wasnt a fluke. amazing food and service."}
{"text":"Great portion size for the lunch specials. Affordable prices and filling. Friendly owner."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I attended the high school across the street and the quality has always remained impeccable! 

You really cannot find a dragon roll anywhere else in the city that tastes as good as it does here!!!"}
{"text":"Small family owned place with really great sushi and homemade hot food. Prices are resonance and staff (basically mother son and father) are very friendly and fun to chat to. The mom makes some killer rolls! Overall the menu is quite simple but the Ingredients are very high quality (down to the Wasabi and ginger). Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever eaten. I was there tonight.  The reviews were pretty positive. I was very impressed not only with the food but by the family that owns the place. Sweet people :)

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here, thinking I'd be in for some good authentic sushi; I was disappointed.

We had the sara for 2, which came with 13 pieces of nigiri, 8 pieces of salmon sashimi, and 4 pieces of whitefish sashimi - all for $24, but I guess you get what you pay for. I was disappointed with the sashimi; the salmon was quite tough and chewy, and the white fish was even worse. 

The nigiri comes with a bit of the sharpest horseradish wasabi I've ever had - you feel it go up your nose until your eyes water. It turns out that's a specialty of theirs, so maybe that works for some people, but I definitely did not enjoy that. The wasabi completely overpowers everything. Even though the rice was quite good, all I could focus on was the stinging horseradish paste. Wasabi is not supposed to kick like that. 

The rolls were decent, nothing particularly memorable. We ordered the black dragon, the spicy tuna, and the dynamite rolls. Stick to the rolls if you come here. It's a bit misleading that it calls itself a \"sushi bar\". You're better off going to an AYCE for this quality."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years now.  This is the highest quality sushi you can find in the area run by a super nice family.  They import ingredients from Japan to make their sushi.  While I assume it's more expensive for them to do this, it translates into great tasting sushi that is made with care.  

Overall, the prices are cheap, the quality and taste is amazing, fast and friendly service.  

I suggest the roll lover combo or one of their lunch specials such as the nama sushi.  You can customize your order to your preference as well."}
{"text":"We tried it was ok the quality of the food really good ..the price was slightly more expensive for the quantity.. the person at the cashier was very friendly ..it's more to takeaways only two small tables for dine-in"}
{"text":"This sushi is very fresh. The restaurant is family run/owned and they're all lovely people who really take time with each customer.

They marinate their rice so it isn't full of vinegar/hard. Their sashimi (hand cut by the mother) is amazing. So fresh, big pieces, melts in your mouth.

I really enjoyed it, will be back."}
{"text":"This place has the best sushi rice I every had around town!  And I had been a lot of sushi places around the GTA area!  Family owned, friendly, and they deliver now too,  Everything is amazing there, and it's always my go to place when I want sushi."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi joint I ordered from! The process for online ordering was easy - and there was a sizeable selection! It took me a while to decide on what I wanted.

After I placed my order, I got a very friendly phone call confirming what I wanted, if I wanted cutlery, ginger and wasabi, etc. It was nice of them to do! 

For those of you that like wasabi, it's REALLY  spicy but really good! 

I got two rolls - one of which I forgot what it was, but the one that stuck with me was the spicy salmon crunch roll. It was so delicious! And the flavours were just right. 

I will definitely order again when I'm in sauga! I might even go out of the way to come here."}
{"text":"This is a small place and the owners and their son are very friendly.  

They do write that their wassabi has a kick, and it does taste good.  What I don't understand is why they use the wassabi to stick the fish to the rice??!!! 

I just want to taste the fish and the rice!!!  I want to try again...but don't have the heart to...though it was very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi bar.

12.99 for lunch.
20.99 for dinner.

I went with a couple of friends at dinner time. We only went for a quick bite before going to party, so we didn't get to try too many things.

I had some Spicy Tuna Roll, Mango Roll, and Vegetable tempura. The fish was very fresh and the tempura just right. The place was clean, the service was quick and friendly.

Will definitely go back if I am in the area."}
{"text":"The local sushi joint. 

I've been going to this place as long as I can remember. Whether it be back in the high school days when they would sell a serving of oyako-don for $2.25, or now, when I'd get their sushi/sashimi combo dinners. 

This is a small restaurant with only a few tables, and patrons are mostly there for takeout. Orders can be placed ahead of time and usually take about 10 minutes to fulfill. Prices are reasonable - expect to be paying about $10-13 for a sushi/sashimi combo dinner, which includes a freshly made California roll and 6-8 pieces of sashimi. 

I'm usually not the biggest fan of California rolls but I'm a sucker for the ones that Sora makes. The sesame seeds that they line the roll with are crunchy and add flavour. Their sashimi isn't always the freshest, but is still better than most of the offerings you can find in Mississauga. Quality is definitely many notches above an AYCE joint, which is always a plus. 

The family who owns this shop are very sweet, always polite and accommodating. It's easy to be a repeat customer here with how well you are treated.

Hopefully they will continue to be successful for many years to come."}
{"text":"Don't say yes to wasabi! Don't know what the dude was thinking. I ordered a medium tray and everything was pewny. Besides that, I said yes to wasabi and the son put so much that it wasn't edible. My mouth was on fire and didn't seem fresh. Wouldn't recommend it and I live CLOSE."}
{"text":"Best little sushi place in Mississauga, service is friendly, food is fresh and prices are affordable. If you haven't been you must go. Or if you prefer not leaving your home to eat, order in, they deliver!"}
{"text":"This place have fresh sashimi, some of it still basically frozen sashimi. The price is quite pricey.. They also give free soup."}
{"text":"Sora Sushi continues to be the best sushi takeout place in Mississauga. The quality is good, prices are reasonable and the service is awesome. Sam along with his Mother and Father runs this place and is extremely accommodating. 

It's great to be able to have a friendly discussion every time you need to prepare a party tray of sushi. You can arrange to pick up your order at a prearranged time and they make it very close to that pick up time. 

Give Sam a call for your sushi order and enjoy the sushi and the service. Always great!"}
{"text":"must try the oyaka-don.  Got this almost every day in high school.  Prices increase every year, but still worth it"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The sushi's great, the prices are great, and the gentleman who works there is very very friendly!!  I usually find that what dampens my sushi experiences at bigger restaurants is the pretentious staff that I often encounter - I like this little gem because it lacks that.  It's a very small place, but there are tables at which to sit down.  They offer take-out as well, and I've never had any issues in that department.  

Yup, definitely craving it now."}
{"text":"Small, family owned place that totally rocks. Seriously, they make the best rolls I've ever had (and I've had lots!). 

I must have passed by that place literally thousands of times and I've never noticed it. I discovered it just last week and I have already eaten there twice.

It's not a fancy place, more like a hole in the wall type of business, with only 4 tables available. It really doesn't matter though because the quality of food is superb and that's all that matters. 

So far I've tried the following rolls: crunchy spicy salmon, spicy salmon, crunchy spicy tuna, mississauga roll and teriyaki chicken roll. I simply cannot wait to go back there again."}
{"text":"Sora Sushi is our go-to when we want sushi and don't want to leave our house. It's a small family-owned sushi bar but they deliver. Their sashimi is so fresh that it melts in your mouth.  Another great item to order is the Kalbi dinner - it's a secret recipe made by the mom. You also can't go wrong with any of their special maki rolls. 

I believe that this is the best sushi you can get in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant, staffs were very friendly and food was great, we had the sushi party platter, good portion for the price! Only reason I couldn't give 5 star was we wish they could give more other kinds of fish."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Friendly owners. Came in a few minutes before closing time but they were super welcoming. Will return:)"}
{"text":"This is a nice little mom and pop style shop. It's  apparent when you walk in and it all looks so bare and you can hear a Korean drama playing near the cash register. But the food is pretty good and cheap. The sashimi was decently fresh and buttery. Maybe not the best sashimi I've had but hey it was only 9 bucks. The California roll was awesome though. There's a nice flavour to the sushi rice they use because they use a good amount of vinegar I'm guessing. It really is different from most sushi restaurants. I'll have to try one of their special rolls next time. I'm guessing that's where their specialty lies. That said the miso soup was also  nice and the yakiniku dish was great too. The portions were also very fair. The only part I didn't like was their salad which was kind of gross. You can't win em all!"}
{"text":"Cute little sushi shop in the plaza. I've passed by this place for years and years but never dropped by to try. Only 2 tables and a bar seating area by the windows. It's a Japanese place owned by Koreans. Prices are average for a sushi place but the quality impressed me. Sashimi was also cut thicker than I expected and sushi was small but good. I would come again but maybe for takeout because it's a little awkward when you're the only ones eating there."}
