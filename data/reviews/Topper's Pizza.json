{"text":"I ordered a triple order of Topper's Sticks at 2am. It is currently 4:30am and they aren't here. Topper's turned their phone off at 3:30am so it looks like I'm not getting my food. This is really poor customer service. There is a debit on my checking account, and no missed calls on my phone."}
{"text":"Didn't actually get a pizza from here but I am a frequent customer at Starbucks (they are next door neighbors)  and every time I am about to pull out of the drive way I am very careful because I constantly see the topper delivery cars driving like a bat out of hell. No doubt they would have hit me head on if I wasn't paying attention. So honestly I would never ever get pizza from a company that lacks respect like that."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for delivery at 8:30pm since we had guests over. They said it would arrive in 30min. The location was literally 2km away. They asked for our number in case of anything and we fully gave our address and directions on how to get to our location. 9:44 no call or pizza. We call back they said he's on his way and that when he arrives call us back to get a discount. 10pm. Still nothing. Call at 10:10 to cancel. Our guests left. 10:25pm they call back asking us to \"open our FaceTime\" and that they were on our street. Poor customer service. Poor communication within their establishment. And no appologizes from the establishment what so ever. Very unprofessional. Extremely disappointing. Would rank 0/5 if possible."}
{"text":"Oh you gotta be fucking kidding me.    If you live in a dorm, topper's is like your idea of heaven.  There's something about being that age that makes you want to order cheese covered bread that's so greasy that it soaks through the box and then dip it in ranch dressing.    You know what that something is called?  It's called weed."}
{"text":"I love Pizza. I love Wings and I love bread sticks. These are just some of my favourite things.. So for me to take an order of all three items totalling nearly $40 and throw it all in the garbage after just a few bites of each.. It must be Horrid.  My family felt the same way.  Bread sticks where gummy and tasted funny. the wings were bland I could have done better at home. And the Pizza ew. sweet Ketchup tomato sauce, the cheese wasn't good and the crust that they brag about was gummy and sub par. authentic Italian FAR from it.    All and All I can usually eat a Pizza even if it's not that good. So for me to chuck it in the trash it is VERY BAD."}
{"text":"Sorry i hated the pizza . not worth the money . the owner should be around, to take care of his crappy workers"}
{"text":"Ordered a small beef pizza quick as they were about to close and based off the reviews I was hungry and had to try it. I would say it was a decent price and definitely quality pizza. Will be going back again and definitely a plus side for people who want whole wheat instead of white dough."}
{"text":"For late night delivery it is pretty standard.  Nothing really spectacular, nothing really crap.   If glass nickel pizza isn't delivering or  if you're a third shifter look for something other then the vending machine special, this option isn't to bad."}
{"text":"Ok. Very good delivery service but pizza was just ok; a little doughy for me."}
{"text":"The best pizza ever!      Chock  Full of quality toppings and double the amount of their competitor on the same plaza.. And for the same money!       I am a devoted customer now and won't buy pizza anywhere else in future.    Give it a try..... You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Never had any problems with this location. Excellent pizza, always somewhat timely. Employees are friendly over the phone and in person."}
{"text":"Inconsistent quality and literally just got attitude from the order taker telling me I needed to call back in an hour to order pizza. It's 9 pm on a Tuesday, take my order and manage my expectations appropriately on when it will be ready. #poorcustomerservice"}
{"text":"Closes early repeatedly. If its an evening with nothing else open, not cool. Guy inside listening to loud bg music. All lights on, before closing time, open neon glowing. Me at door: starving, cold, and now no hope for food in madison; unless someone opens a steak 'n shake, waffle house, etc. Seriously, why is it near impossible to get food here?  The gyro sandwich I previously had sucked. Bread wad hard and stale. Phone# is longwinded & unhelpful, no option to leave message for main office. Not going to this slice o' somethin again."}
{"text":"Best pizza we have ever had and I didn't get a heartburn, love and will be back for more.  I have comments from others, the new owner and staff are very friendly, the kitchen is very clean see for yourself.  WE WILL BE BACK.  Thanks Toppers Aurora."}
{"text":"Our Order for pickup was 30+ min late. Then, to top(per's) it off, the order was completely wrong. We ate the wrong order and to be honest, it wasn't that great:/"}
{"text":"Not bad for a cheap pizza option.  Always has coupons available for pizza and bread sticks combos.  Nice for carry out because they provide plates and utensils."}
{"text":"My friends and I ordered 1 Large pizza and 1 Triple Order Original Toppers sticks through their website at 5:45p.  The estimated delivery time was 6:37p. Not too bad...However, the delivery guy didn't show up until 7:15p. To me, that is not good service. especially for only two pizzas. Delivery guy only said, \"sorry about that\" and when we called at 7:15p to make sure that the order went through, they guy just said, \"It's on its way.\" I think it could have been handled much better!"}
{"text":"This place isn't really sanitary. If you watch the employees you'll notice they don't wash their hands as often as they should. ie right after taking your payment, or after they just swept the floor, or rubbed their nose. WTH is wrong with people and their home training"}
{"text":"cheese bread. it's like mana from heaven. and TOPPERS makes me wait ONE FUCKING HOUR to get it.  that is total bull shit. so i have been waiting for an hour and no cheese bread.  i am drunk and angry and am going to NOT want to tip...WTF???"}
{"text":"The pizza was so so . I ordered thick crust. Seems they missed it on the order or the dough did not rise . Too bad it's usually pretty good."}
{"text":"In the past 8 months I have picked up pizza from toppers Newmarket several times. I often order online and pick it up on my way to work or for a larger group we stop into the store.  The pizza has been good the staff pleasant and the order hot and fresh.  Tonight our group wanted pizza for dinner. With 6 pizzas to order and wings on the side. I called for pickup. Due to my honest yet poor previous review the owner will no longer take my orders.  So what does that say of customer service?"}
{"text":"So toppers is fantastic... Bacon Toppers Sticks and fantastic delicious pizza... End of story. Bad things? they take WAY too long sometimes to get an order ready however I will say they are generally always busy. Especially this particular location because they are so close to downtown, students are hitting this place up all day. Also at the end of the night on a friday and saturday night it becomes packed to the gills right around 2:30am. Mainly students who work there but they are always really nice and do their best to get you your order ASAP. This location is great but they could get an order done a tad faster."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for pizza night. Employees are welcoming, patient and generous with the amount of toppings. The spicy pizza sauce is amazing and I recommend getting the free garlic butter crust and dunking it into their house dipping sauce. Bonus points for the loyalty stickers that allow you to redeem free pizza!"}
{"text":"This review isn't about Topper's pizza, it's about one of their drivers. I was crossing the street right in front of Topper's at a walk signal last night when a delivery driver came speeding as fast as he could around the corner. He came about a foot from running my boyfriend and I over. The driver had the nerve to scream at US out the window. This intersection has a lot of campus pedestrian traffic and this guy was driving incredibly dangerously. My boyfriend went into Topper's to tell them about what had just happened in front of their store but I don't know what'll come of it. I just hope that this driver didn't hit anyone on the rest of his delivery route."}
{"text":"I just bought a pizza to take home. I got in the car and opened the box.. the pizza was a Toppers Classic but mostly cheese and marinara sauce. Couple of topping on it, enough probably toooings to put just on a slice and not the whole pizza. they are some cheap ass pizza place!! My entire pizza is marinara sauce and cheese! I'll never buy again from them!! They used to have amazing pizza when they open the store but lately they are below even a 0 star rating!! Don't buy from them!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Got pizza and sticks with my buddy (BBQ chicken, natch) and remembered to request that the driver call, rather than ring the doorbell. My dog, sweet as she is, barks like a maniac when people knock on door which wakes up the six month old. It's a whole thing.   Anyway, back to the za: the driver buzzed the doorbell, my dog freaked out, my baby cried. I was annoyed but ready to get my munch on. I was quickly dismayed to find that both the pizza and breadsticks were incredibly undercooked and doughy. (I'm fairly intoxicated as I write this, so my standards are pretty low - I did get toppers after all)  All I wanted to do was get my grub on. Smh  Edit: I bumped it up to two stars from the original review of one -- following my review, the General Manager of the E. Wash store (Marcus Mrdjenovich) sent me a nice email apologizing for the errors and mailed me a few gift certificates. I certainly didn't expect that nice touch (or was trying to get free food out of it), so I was pleasantly surprised. Good customer service recovery."}
{"text":"Terrific pizza and the cheese bread is out of this world.  It's a shame they closed their West Town area location."}
{"text":"Giving it three instead of four because of their inconsistency.  Sometimes there has been almost a complete lack of sauce on the pizza and other times almost no cheese.  When I'm in the area and I want some food packed with carbs and cholesterol they're all right."}
{"text":"I'm clueless as to why there is so much hype for this place. Maybe I should have ordered one of their specialty pizzas, but I opted for a cheese pizza instead. And it's bad.    Wish I would have opened up the box when I picked it up; there is only a small amount of cheese on the pizza, and it has clearly been sitting there for awhile. On top of very little cheese, I got jipped on sauce. It was only luke warm, and it is hard to choke down another piece.   Next time I'm craving pizza, I'll stock up on some frozen pizzas or walk down the street to Rocky Rococo's."}
{"text":"We have had nothing but good luck with them.  Quality food, super fast delivery, and everyone is very polite.  I was surprised this time that the specials were gone and a delivery fee was added, but the guy on the phone was up front about it."}
{"text":"It's average pizza at best.  It was pretty plain and boring.  Nothing here made me want to return.  For the area, I think there are better options."}
{"text":"Ordered online, delivery showed up without the drinks we ordered. Had to call twice. Pizza is subpar, but thats what you should expect when you order at 1am. My goodness was the sauce unflavorful, it was like a salted ketchup. That cheese was uneventful, it made me seriously doubt that Wisconsin is the dairy state. The pepperoni was alright, it lived up to my now depressed expectations. Had some nacho toppers, ew. They wouldn't pass as good drunk food. You know you are in trouble when the liquid nacho cheese has not solidified after being left at room temp for 7 hours, not even a skin or film has developed. You might ask how much trouble are you in? Well right now I'm sitting on the toilet of my hotel room using a towel to dab the sweat off my forehead, praying I don't pass out from the brown serpent's gas. My knuckles turing white from holding on to the handicap railing as I ride the porcelain coaster. In short, I would recommend getting delivery, grab a movie and tray table and set it up on the toilet to enjoy the pizza. Who knows maybe I had a bad batch, but I eat food past their expiration date and don't have the spiritual experience that I am having currently."}
{"text":"I was a staunch pizza nova guy until i went to toppers at the highway 27 location in Woodbridge. They had a promotional price on the large with 3 toppings for $10. I asked the guy at the counter how much it would cost to change it to xl and he didn't charge me. Furthermore he let me choose different toppings for the other half. That isn't even the best part, the pizza was amazing, everyone enjoyed it. The pizza these guys make is definitely up their. Its unfortunate their aren't more toppers around but I'm lucky as this one opened up close to my house. I have been their 5 times since my initial visit and I am collecting stickers which will eventually get me a free pizza. I love everything about this place.!if your in Woodbridge and looking for a pizza definitely try this place"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites.  It can be a bit greasy, but pizza maybe a bit better when it's greasy.  The cheese is awesome.  I'm not big on specialty pizza's, but I like their pepperoni and sausage."}
{"text":"From the second I walked through the front door I knew the 2.5 star review was inaccurate. Very clean store, very friendly staff and great customer service. I was in and out in 10 minutes. Pizza was warm and well made. I would always be Leary of a 1 star review from someone who was complaining about a few dollars on a website that may have had data incorrectly entered by the user. I would definitely order from this location again. I wish people would take a little bit of time and think your review through before posting. This review may have cost someone their job."}
{"text":"It's pretty good overall but they were too light on the sauce and the music inside was disturbingly loud. Pretty good."}
{"text":"You have to completely and utterly tanked to enjoy Toppers. Period. There is no other reason any reasonable person would ever want to put this shit into their body. This is the result of Ronald McDonald and the Noid conceiving a demon baby in a pit of flaming grease.  I have personally witnessed the reinforced cardboard pizza box fall apart under the pressure of that seeping acid they call oil. You will have burning diarrhea for days. There is good cheese everywhere in Wisconsin; the pudding-like goop they put on top of their pizza is not an excuse to do this to yourself.  Combine this with the fact that they have the most arrogant, inattentive customer service in the history of restaurants, and it makes for the shittiest dining experience possible. It takes no less than an hour to get a pizza from here, but it leans more towards 2-3 hours when it's late and the drunk idiots with no taste barrage the place with orders. I am pretty sure that eating at Toppers is forbidden in the Old Testament. For the sake of yourself, everyone in smelling distance of you, and the children with birth defects you may father/mother if you continue to eat here, just put down the phone.  Upped to 2 stars because I enjoyed it in a drunken, shameful moment of weakness. May or may not have cried afterwards."}
{"text":"I'm only speaking for today at 11:39 AM. Excellent customer service, speedy and friendly. I had very little expectations walking in, but was pleasantly surprised to find a cheery staff member who was patient with answering my questions about the menu, as well as making recommendations. 5 stars today! Keep up the great work Toppers east side!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever had. I'm visiting from LA, we have some awesome pizza out there too. But this is the best pizza I've had in all of Wisconsin. Make sure to get your pizza on the tall boy crust!! Toppers, you guys rock!!!!"}
{"text":"Now here is how to make a pizza. If you like tons of finely chopped toppings then you're home. Never a problem here. Nice staff. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Ordered a specialty tater tot pizza with chicken added along with an order of bread sticks. Holy cow was the pizza good!! It was nice to get something a little different.  It came loaded with ranch dressing, tater tots, green onions, bacon and cheese sauce. We added chicken as well. The cheese sticks were what you would expect. They did put in 3 packets of dipping sauce so you wouldn't run out.  Our delivery was on time and the food was hot when we dug in.  No complaints here!"}
{"text":"They consistently screw up my order. Like every time I go - they either forget to add the drizzled sauce or they make it with the wrong crust or whatever.   I don't care because the staff is usually super awesome about it and the food is heavenly. True story - I was drunk one night and me and a few buddies decided that Toppers is literally the best restaurant in the world. Okay - maybe not, but for a twenty something like me - I pretty much survive off Toppers. I also haven't done much world traveling.    Maybe once I graduate from college and go travel the world to experience real pizza - I'll start to turn against my old standby - but it's going to be really hard to beat their buffalo chicken pizza.   Thanks Toppers. You're awesome. Even when you do consistently **** my order up!"}
{"text":"Skip the delivery, go for pickup.  This has to be one of the most creative lobbies of a pizza place I've come across.  4 TVs, with one always on Nick Jr.  My 3 year old appreciates that.  Not to mention a basketball hoop, hula hoops, and other fun things to keep you occupied.  That is to say you won't be waiting forever for your pizza.  Typically just a few minutes, but a fun atmosphere to be in.  The food, oh yeah.  It's solid.  Great specialty pizzas, including the buffalo chicken pizza and the taco pizza.  Not too many places make a taco pizza around here.  This place does, and it's great.    It's a great choice for the family.  While it may not be the cheapest place in town, it's a great choice."}
{"text":"Toppers pizza is what Pizza Hut used to be, tasty and full of flavour I would recommend getting the pepperoni and bacon pizza insanely tasty!. Great pizza for a decent price I used to order from Dominoes but Toppers just makes really tasty toppings and pizza sauce and the crust is great too."}
{"text":"I'm don't usually do yelp reviews, but I feel that after the exemplary service Topper's gave me tonight, one is most needed.  Tonight, after experiencing some typical midnight munchies, I decided to contact my favorite pizza provider in madison, Toppers.  Now, I'm not leaving this review because I think Topper's is delicious, because honestly, you might have something wrong with you if you don't think Topper's is delicious.  I'm leaving this review because of the effort their graveyard shift staff gave me when making my order.    Tonight, amid my intoxicated state, I felt it necessary that a hula girl should be drawn on the box of my Hawaiian pizza.  I saw this as a joke at the time, because I did not expect a hula girl to be drawn.  But alas, upon receiving my delicious Maui pizza with its pineapple and Canadian bacon deliciousness, I found on the inside of the box, a beautifully drawn hula girl.   Ok, I exaggerate, the hula girl had a unibrow and 11 toes which made her look more like helga the handsome, but I found the Topper's employees' effort far beyond satisfactory.   That  is the reason that I will return to the toppers website whenever I'm stoned out of my mind or drunk beyond belief at 2am.  Good for you, Topper's.  You are the hero Madison needs."}
{"text":"Got me a personal size pizza, and it was good as any quick pizza place add any.  Better than other chains, but not quite gourmet like stoney's."}
{"text":"If you haven't had Topperstix before you are really missing out. Consistently delicious! It's always ready within 15 minutes. The California pizza is one of my favorite pizzas. My family has consistently ordered from there for years and will continue to."}
{"text":"Pizza has normally been good, but the last few times I've ordered the Topperstix they have come cold, well done, and without much cheese. Sad."}
{"text":"I had never heard of Toppers before the opening flyer had arrived at our home and I am So glad that I tried this location right away. I had ordered online and went to pick up my pizza. It's located in a little Plaza near booster juice I believe, and there is not a lot of room to sit however it seems like it would be more of a pickup location.  Overall my initial impression was the excellent customer service. The workers at the front were very helpful and had my order ready for the time of pickup.  The actual pizza was absolutely delicious as well, I love that I can add a free hot sauce swirl on top without paying extra. Being a pizza fanatic, I have tried all the locations near here and I have to say this is the best tasting pizza for the price (so far they have always had great promotions). The promotion I used yesterday was a large veggie pizza for 10 dollars- an absolute steal. I also received a magnet on which if you put 10 stickers (you receive a sticker on your receipt everytime you go there) that you would receive one medium pizza with three toppings-who doesn't love free pizza! I would definitely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"We order from here almost weekly. 8/10 times the food is great. They don't have just regular \"breadstick\" topper stix, though, which I find weird & one time our pizza was more doughy than it was cooked. If you are picking up, it's almost always ready 5 minutes later than the given time."}
{"text":"We were quoted $9.48 on our pizza online but they upcharged us when we went to pick up our order ($11.59) saying that more sauce and less cheese counts as \"extra toppings\". The pizza was made on time but it's frustrating on principle that they would do such a thing."}
{"text":"Open late hours, delivery, SOOOO cheesy! The cheesy Toppersticks are de-freaking-licious. So buttery. So greasy. Soooooo delightful. Costs a bit more, but it's a distinctive cheesybread. :)"}
{"text":"I just got hung up on after listening to the person on the phone saying, people on the way home are so annoying.   They made me hold for 20 minutes but then hung up on me."}
{"text":"Currently waiting for our order to be delivered. Estimated wait time was 40 minutes and now we're going on an hour and 40 minutes. We've ordered toppers sticks before from other locations and it's never taken this long. This location must be awful. The company should try to give a more accurate wait time, we live 5 minutes from the store! Very disappointed so far."}
{"text":"Bunch of losers. I was out drinking so I didn't expect much from my local toppers. I ordered at 1:15 am on a Friday night. I got the ETA of 1:43 am, not to far off from what to expect. Here I am at 2:22 am with no pizza. I called a little after 2 am and was on hold for about 8 minutes. When they picked up, they said they were on the way. The location is about a 3 minutes away. Here we are over 10 minutes from the call and they aren't here. Like I said, a bunch of loser. They probably shit on you pizza. Just get dominos or something."}
{"text":"Yummy Pizza.  The whole family loves it.  They even offer whole wheat pizza."}
{"text":"We've ordered here twice before now.  The first time the pizza was amazing.  The second time, not so much.  Seems like there is a big variance depending on who is behind the counter.  Also, the thin crust is pretty bad.  The normal crust is good.  So, if you are looking to save some carb calories, this probably isn't the best.  The Toppers Sticks were great both times.  The second time they forgot one of our little sauce packets.  This place is a lot like Papa Johns but cleaner and has cheese sticks rather than regular bread/garlic sticks."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. I had a Buffalo Chicken grinder and a small order of Topper Stix. The sandwich cam piping hot and toasted to perfection. It was delicious.  The stix were as they always are...amazingly fattening."}
{"text":"I really like the triple order of cheese sticks at Toppers.  Their pizza really sucks, but the cheese sticks are pretty awesome.  I'm not exactly the most adventurous eater all the time, but i decided to try the mac and cheese pizza.    Obviously they were copying Ian's in that department, but I figured since I like the Ian's pizza, i would try Toppers.  Big mistake.  OMFG, the first bite was awful.  I knew there was something off right away.  I lifted up the noodle cheese crust thing, and I realized that the whole crust was covered in some sort of orange glue.  Seriously, the pizza was covered in some imitation cheese-wiz.  I say imitation because cheese-wiz is better that the orange shit that was on my pizza.  And I ordered a large!  I actually threw the rest of the pizza away, because I wouldn't feed that shit to a dog."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time recently. We tried the grinders: they were good but greasy. I expected more of a baked sub, but these are sort of unusual- plenty of filling, but overall just kind of greasy. I don't think I'll get it again. We also tried the cheese sticks and if it's any indication of what their pizza is like, they were good, if a bit greasy. Overall I thought this place was just ok.   Not much of a dining room here- one table and some soft seating with tvs, probably best for take out."}
{"text":"This place is hilarious. Every time I walk in here I feel like I must be on candid camera. Either that or I've somehow slipped into an alternate universe where the three stooges are real.  The last time I ate here it was because it was the only place open nearby that doesn't have completely terrible food. We were driving from the west side anyway so we placed an order, figuring that it would be ready when we got there. Their phone system is kinda screwed up and we had to call three times to get someone to pick up. When we finally managed to talk to a human, the person on the phone told us our order would be ready in 10 minutes, which seems impossible for a pizza, but we were 15 minutes away anyway, so it didn't seem like a big deal. When we got there 15 minutes later, the pizza wasn't ready. After another 15 minutes, the pizza wasn't ready. After another 15 minutes the pizza wasn't ready. Someone who looked like a manager ran out and apologetically told us that they were out of what we ordered (the taco pizza) and offered to make us a pizza for free. Half an hour later, they finished that pizza and we were able to eat.  Topper's estimated time: 10 minutes. Actual time: 90 minutes. But wait, there's more!  How could it possible to 1.5 hours to get a pizza? We're not 100% sure, but from what we overheard, it sounds like they were out of the lettuce they needed to make a taco pizza. Instead of skipping the lettuce or asking if we wanted another pizza, they had the next overloaded delivery driver that went out try to find a grocery store and buy lettuce. Keep in mind that we chose toppers because it was so late that everything was closed. So, that kid goes out, does his deliveries, checks some groceries stores, and finds that none of the gas station 7-11 knockoffs have lettuce, and then reports back. When that happens, he drives back to the store and tells them that there's no lettuce available. And then they ask us if we want another pizza. THEY WENT TO BUY GROCERIES BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE INGREDIENTS ON HAND TO MAKE ONE OF THEIR PIZZAS. AND THEN THEY FAILED AT BUYING GROCERIES. DOUBLE-YOU TEE EFF.  1 star for the actual pizza and service. 5 stars for the entertainment value. One word warning on the entertainment value: if you order a pizza, you might end up waiting a few years as they breed the cow they used to get the milk for the cheese they use."}
{"text":"Last 5-6 orders of toppers sticks didn't have the ordered extra cheese, was small, and was burnt to absolute hell. No idea why I ordered from this one that many times. Just because online automatically puts that one in. This location is horrible."}
{"text":"Thought I would give Toppers a try.  Very friendly staff, informative and good pizza to boot.  Thanks guys for helping a first timer and I will be back!"}
{"text":"This pizza is like energy for my soul. It literally keeps me alive and walking day to day. Thanks Toppers."}
{"text":"The people in my family are pretty serious about pizza.  They have it for dinner, and assuming there is any left over, it's gone by breakfast.  Not so with Toppers.  Everyone said \"meh, it's ok.\"    Overall, it took them three days to finish off the leftovers of two small 9 inch pizzas, and that was with me kind of pushing it on them.   I was shocked!  I don't think we'll be going back any time soon, not with so many other better choices around."}
{"text":"Online ordering is only ok. Ordered tonight and had an ETA of 7:05. Didn't hear anything at 730. called and said it would be there by eight. Arrived at 750, only warm and rubbery. Done ordering from this location."}
{"text":"So excited to order from this place, heard the pizza was the bomb! So I ordered a 1/2 burger and 1/2 California hand tossed pizza for delivery. What I got was a thin crust, something. I called to tell them, obviously someone else was going to get my pizza cause I got there's. After the phone on the phone, I didn't get his name. Told me \"it's ok, you shouldn't be sorry\" I told him I will gladly double check my wrong pizza and call him back so he can apologize to me.  After double checking, low and behold, the customer was right! Wrong pizza. So  I called back explained to a lovely woman about the mix up and the attitude of the guy and asked to speak with him. He wouldn't come to the phone and she's sending my correct pizza. I hope it's going to be good after this long wait, but I just want to be clear this dude was a real ass.  The pizza ended up fantastic but I'd suggest maybe some customer service classes for that dude."}
{"text":"Food is fine by toppers standards, but don't order delivery expecting it to arrive in the near future.  Ordered one pizza and one order of sticks yesterday and it didn't arrive until 30 minutes past the estimated arrival window for a total time of 1 hour and 15 minutes after I ordered.  I live only 10 minutes from toppers, so it definitely wasn't the drive time...  Don't waste your time.  With places like Sugar River nearby, spend the extra dollar or two, get fantastic pizza, and be eating within 40 minutes of your order."}
{"text":"I had a pleasant surprise the other day... I was walking into Walmart and I saw the Toppers Pizza truck at the front of the door - and people were crowding around the vehicle.  So curiosity got the best of me, and I realized they were handing out free pizzas.  Yes. FREE medium pizza as a promotion.  They had just opened a Toppers in the plaza.  I have always enjoyed Toppers from the location in Orangeville.  I was happy to see that the Woodbridge location kept up to my expectations.  LOADED with toppings, great dough...   Toppers pizza is up there with the better pizza joints if you ask me.  Can't wait for our next pizza night at home!  Toppers it is!"}
{"text":"I love toppers pizza, but tonight I'm not impressed with deliver system because I'm still wait for my pizza 3hrs now and have called twice, they said my order out for deliver and extra hour half before. This Worst Service ever"}
{"text":"I kid you not. I just called in to place an order for 25 pizzas for delivery. She told me I was 2 blocks outside of her delivery zone and I could pick them up. I said I am not going to pick them up as 25 pizzas is more then I wish to drive with. I asked her to check with her manager to see if they had any flexibility and she said she would not to call another pizza place. So I did. I guess that is what they prefer."}
{"text":"WOW!!! I placed an order online for delivery and next thing I know, the pizza is being delivered to my hotel room in less than 18 minutes!!! And it looks absolutely scrumptious!!! Driver extremely friendly and totally awesome!! Can't wait to order from Toppers again!!"}
{"text":"Too bad there isn't a zero stars option. Absolutely the worst experience ever!  I ordered a pizza on a Monday  (can't imagine it was too busy at 11pm) and still it took over an hour for it to arrive. It gets better. I peeked out my balcony window to see the delivery driver having a smoke and casually chatting on his cell phone. After about 5-7 minutes I finally receive a buzz from downstairs and I proceed to let him in. Another 5 minutes goes by so I open my door to see if he's lost on my floor. He's still chatting on his cell then looks up at me and says \"oh, hey\". I pay for the pizza and tip generously despite the poor service. When I opened the box I discovered the pizza was stone cold. The cheese had hardened as if it's been sitting out for a few hours. Quite disappointed I called the main number and they were quite pleasant and offered me a free pizza which I accepted. Now fast forward a month later. I placed an order to which I assumed would be complimentary. The young lady that I spoke to immediately jumped into defensive mode as I was just trying to explain the situation and that I had a credit on the account. She kept saying there was only a $5 credit and that nothing could be done until the manager was in. Before I could say another word she hung up on me. I then called back and spoke to another \"manager\".  This guy was much nicer but still told me that there was nothing they could do to accommodate me about that pitiful cold pizza. $5 was the offer or I could leave my number and have the manager call me back within 24 hours. I told him I'd like to hear from the manager and also cancelled the order.  No one ever called, I imagine the message got \"lost\".  Absolutely the worst customer service ever. Will never order from here ever again. You are better off going literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"Angela is the best. She told us we were right on the cutoff of the delivery area and we got some bomb topper stix because of that fact. Good work Angela."}
{"text":"Here on business and ordered a carry out Vegetable hand tossed.  Better than Pizza Hut and not nearly as much grease.  Was going to save some for the next day but couldnt."}
{"text":"this place is terrible. the pizza sucked.  They screwed up my order and I had to wait 3 hours"}
{"text":"Ugh. Some of the worst pizza I've ever had, even worse than Pizza Pit. Plus, ended up being more like plastic as it somehow took them OVER AN HOUR to deliver in the rain. I used to deliver and no rain ever stalled me that long on a delivery. Thankfully it was my friend who paid as he seems to like the trash Toppers serves. No, not even the TopperStix can are worth it. Do yourself a favor and avoid Toppers at all costs. Your digestive system will thank you for it."}
{"text":"Came in good time I guess. Everything was burnt though, would have been better undercooked. Pics attached..."}
{"text":"Do NOT order a THIN crust pizza from here! Just finished returning a thin crust smoky BBQ chicken pizza to the manager. Wish I took a pic of this pathetic looking pizza! Lots of BBQ sauce, a few pieces of chicken you could count on one hand, no cheese and a very browned crust. And it tasted like ... cardboard! My husband asked if he ordered another one right now would it look like this? And he said yes!! Wow!! Simply amazing the attitude on this guy. My husband pointed out the burnt crust and his reply was it's a thin crust pizza! Managed to get him to make us another pizza, our usual order with a REGULAR crust! Other pizzas we have ordered in the past are always amazing and the new one he made looked delicious as it should! But customer service was very disappointing today. He needs to check out their competitor's thin crust pizzas!"}
{"text":"Great pizzas, huge variety, ordered from here several times. A few times it was a little slow. Coupons give you some extra discounts."}
{"text":"Toppers was one of those pizza's that starts off tasting pretty good, then you eat enough of it that you just start feeling... well... not so great."}
{"text":"It was a Topperstix experience in high school that made me realize I wanted to go to college... (that's sort of true) They're disgusting, greasy, and always taste a little burnt-like-funny but for $9.99 and 3 different dipping sauces, I can't complain too much. (since my mouth is full of greasy tasty-ness)"}
{"text":"Passing through the area after visiting my sister, our curiosity heightens after the hunger notion from my hubby's crying belly.  Pizza pizza would've been the safer option(same plaza), as many years a loyal customer however that would've been boring.  Small brightly lit joint late at night, no customers and a smart young chap greeted us representing as the cashier, chef and my then instant friend and pacifier of grease cravings.  We ended up ordering the 2 large, one deluxe and one double cheeseburger. Lotsa toppings and heavy on the flavor, I looooved the dough!!! Similar to Little Ceasar's but way better. Light and fluffy yet firmly baked to hold the load.   New pizza spot for us whenever we are in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty atrocious service when you give your address, spend ten minutes putting in a $75 order, and then get told they don't deliver to your location even though the website directed to you to call their location and they deliver to your friends a block away.  And then you offer the delivery driver a $20 tip--wait no--still tentative? a $40 tip... and then you recoil into your pizzaless depression and ask which location delivers to your address that  you just moved into today after 48 straight hours of exhaustion and the girl on the phone says, \"No one.\"  You may as well just kill yourself before attempting to order pizza from this place.  I mean, every time you order their pizza you pretty much wanna commit suicide the day after, but finding out you can't even order from the one place that advertises late night pizza after you spent an entire day moving and they're the only assholes open that deliver a literal block away from where you are?  Well, at least I won't have to clean up after the \"Topper's runs\" tomorrow when we go back for our apartment checkout.  Long story short: suck it, Toppers.  Your food is crap and your client base is crap and I will happily subscribe to the latter at necessary moments, but your customer service is apparently also crap.  Way to lose a 4+ year customer over a city block.  Way to represent your brand.  Idiots."}
{"text":"These pricks called my girlfriend 5 times today claiming that we ordered a pizza from them online. We didn't. We have in the past multiple times, but not today. Not only were the phone calls excessive, the lowlife on the phone then proceeded to accuse her of lying to him and said that he was going to \"place a note in her file\", whatever that means. Won't be ordering from here again. I'm going to encourage all of my friends to start placing false orders with them, and hopefully someone will learn a quick lesson that harassing customers with accusations of lying to a second rate pizza joint, is a terrible way to run a business."}
{"text":"Here's the thing, their food is actually really good. No really it's tasty pizza for a damn decent price.   The problem here is strictly service. Whether I'm picking up or ordering for delivery, the people I deal with tend to be just awful.    I ordered pizza a few weeks ago, and they got the order wrong. After sighing like I was the worst person in the world, they mailed me a 50% off my next order coupon. Ok, cool. I order pizza yesterday. They tell me it'll be 35 minutes. 1 hour and 15 minutes later I call to see what's going on. I'm told \"Oh, yeah, she just left 5 minutes ago. Why don't you give her some time to arrive?\". Dude, it's a good 40 minutes after you told me the pizza would have arrived. Patience was not my issue, promise."}
{"text":"Note: I am only giving this franchise establishment three stars as a rule I have for chains.  I'm from the Dallas area and had never heard of Topper's until a trip to Madison. After spending the night getting hammered downtown until 2:00 a.m., I was in need of sustenance. I was staying at a hotel in Sun Prairie and everything there shuts down at 10. IHOP(E. Washington location) was packed and McDonald's didn't really sound appealing.   Saw that Topper's is open until 3 and I figured \"what the hell\". I ordered a large 3 topping pizza special that included an order of Topperstix. The fella taking my order was friendly and patient, considering I had about 3 gallons of Long Island ice tea in me, and he suggested the taco Topperstix. Total was just shy of $20. I get back to my hotel room and dive into a damn good pie. The crust had good chew, the toppings tasted fresh and were plentiful and there was plenty of cheese and sauce. What I really enjoyed was the taco Toppersitx. They were way better than I thought they would be and complimented the pizza nicely.   If you're in the need for a quick meal, Topper's is a good bet in my opinion."}
{"text":"Our late Tuesday night order turned out to be an utter disappointment. We placed an online order (from the Regent St. location) at 1 15 AM and the expected time of delivery was 2 00 AM. We waited patiently until 2 15 AM but no pizzas arrived. I then called Topper's and we were told that we would receive our order in the next 15-20 mins since there was only one delivery person around (we were told we would get some 10-20% discount coupon as well). Having waited for an hour already we thought another 15 mins or so would be bearable. But the clock kept ticking and no pizza. I then called again at 2 50 PM asking them again about our order. I was then told that the Regent location does not deliver to my location. My location (on university avenue) is a 10 mins drive from Topper's and I've been ordering from them for years. So this was a bullshit response. I was then told that my delivery would be free and they would attempt to deliver \"soon\". Considering that it was already freakin' 3 AM, I wan't interested in the damn pizza any more. So I told them to them to cancel my order. They promptly did so with very minimal apologies. I finally ate oatmeal and went to bed."}
{"text":"I've ordered take out a bunch of times, and they've always had my order ready by the time I got back from shopping at the 7eleven kitty corner to the location. The thin crust pizza is on par with all the other major chains. My only issue is with their pepperoni, which are fairly narrow slices that curl up and pool the grease as the pizza cooks. I usually do a pat down with a paper towel. The staff are friendly and seemingly efficient."}
{"text":"Easily the worst pizza you'll ever consume.  I'm not sure how you can possibly produce so greasy and tasteless, but my hat goes off to Toppers.  To those that read the reviews that think, \"Well, maybe the Topper's sticks aren't terrible\" they are just the same grotesquely greasy pizza, cut into 'stick' shape pieces. Then, you take these spongy, grease-soaked, inedibly rancid sticks and dip them in Ranch or your favorite vomit-inducing sauce and eat them."}
{"text":"One of my favourite pizza places in town! I love it! Only bad thing is the price. Just makes it harder to go there as often as I would like... maybe that's a good thing for my waistline lol"}
{"text":"We ordered sandwiches for delivery on a Tuesday night.  The ordering process was smooth, professional and polite.  The order arrived within the stated time, so that was another plus.  Now the minuses...when ordering the person taking the order offered me a deal of two sandwiches plus two 20 oz. sodas for $12.99, then proceeded to tell me the total would be $16.46.  That's a hefty delivery charge if you ask me, and sorry but that reduces the tip!  I understand the driver does not receive any of the delivery charge, but jacking the order from $12.99 to $16+ makes me not have much left for a tip.  Now the sandwiches...we both ordered the Philly Cheesesteak.  They were both covered heavily in cheese, making the bun a soggy mess.  Cheese seemed to be the main ingredient in the sandwich, very sparse with the meat and veggie toppings.  Bottom line, would never order a sandwich for delivery again, would never order the Philly Cheesesteak at all and probably wouldn't bother with the pizza after reading other reviews and having better options available."}
{"text":"A friend of mine suggested that when I order pizza next... to try Toppers.  I don't order pizza a whole lot, but sometimes with kids... it really is the best.   We ordered two pizzas... 1) bacon and pineapple, and 2) sundried tomatoes, chicken, and spinach.   The toppers website was very good... I ordered the entire meal through my phone in a couple minutes as a new customer.  The pizza was very good indeed... way better than those standard places we order from.   And the delivery person was extremely friendly... which is always a bonus.  Price was reasonable.   In the end... it was just a delivered pizza order.  But it was great!  I will definitely order from them again.  eg.... and my stomach was okay the day after (not like pizza pizza) :)"}
{"text":"Toppers on Regent: Thank you! Always a wonderful treat to go in and enjoy the pizza and the wonderful employees. A special thanks to Chris and Donovan"}
