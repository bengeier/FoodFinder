{"text":"Had brunch here and ordered the Eggs Benedict.  I had them sub saut√©ed spinach for the bread.  Fantastic !  Great atmosphere and service too.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Took the lady out for a romantic valentines day dinner. Sidecar was booked up solid well in advance, so i quickly jumped on this place, on the recommendations from friends. The servers were youthful and hip, full of energy, and the food was quite good for the prices. Ordered an App, 2 mains, and a bottle of wine, and it came out to around 100 dollars.  I was a little less than smitten with the vibe, it was cute, and youthful, but the laminated cafeteria menus, and squeeky booths need a couple new screws. Overall i had a great time though, with a few minor gripes. The beef wellington was  also quite good (wanted the AAA steak, but they were sold out...maybe a 3.5 is in order.)"}
{"text":"We have eaten at Peter Pan four or five times.  I like the unpretentious and relaxed atmosphere and the casual but attentive service.  The menu is not spectacular but its good fare with good portions and at very reasonable prices.  Recommended for pre theater or a pleasant dinner after shopping on queen west.  We always sit in the old church pews next to the old fashion par."}
{"text":"Writing an update after trying out their Summerlicious menu - I was blown away! The beet salad and grilled salmon with mushroom risotto were amazing, really liked it.   The creme brulee was alright, seems like my friend's tiramisu was better. Pretty good deal for $15, considering how their normal entrees are around $12.  Servers were nice and courteous as usual despite it being jam packed for Summerlicious! Service is always great."}
{"text":"- Dinner for two on a Tuesday night. - Service was fantastic, made the night for us. - Beer selection was quite adequate, you will find something you like. - Started with the Pomme Dauphine Poutine which was enough to split as an appetizer. The poutine was picked as per the house's recommendation alongside the Lamb's Fry. The potatoes, served in an iron skillet, had a good amount of lamb and gruyere. All in all, satisfies your comfort food craving. - Shared two mains:  1 Sage, fennel & tomato marmalade, parmesan gnocchi: Tasty and fresh, the fennel overpowered in some bites but that was to be expected.   2 Steak Frites: ordered medium rare, cooked three ways (hollandaise, bone marrow, and duck fat cromsequis). The differences were very subtle. The beef's origin was not asked about, but tasted great. The Frites were thick cut, lightly fried and quite substantial.  Also shared a sauteed radish skillet alongside the mains. Radishes still had a good crunch, very fresh and not too greasy.  Would visit again. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto we weren't very familiar with good places near the hotel we could walk to for lunch, so when we walked past Peter Pan we thought it looked cute and was worth a try. I am soooo glad we did! Te art work is a little questionable, but the restaurant is quaint and adorable. The service was right on and the food is fresh and delicious. The specials were all tempting and the prices were extremely reasonable, which is important with this weak dollar!   There were so many yummy sounding options that it was hard to pick what to eat! We began with the mushroom soup, which was an amazing start to the meal. The flavor was incredible and very fresh. For our entrees we both ordered sandwiches. It was a tough choice for me, but I settled on a portobello mushroom sandwich and it was sooo delicious. The dressing was great and the bread was perfectly toasted. I am a french fries lover and the ones that came with the salad didn't disappoint. I only wish we discovered Peter Pan earlier in our weekend visit!"}
{"text":"We had our wedding lunch for 41 people in the upstairs space on Saturday and it was fantastic. Everyone raved about the food, the service was friendly and efficient, and the rooms are really beautiful. Alex was wonderful to work with in the planning stages, and they accommodated our macaron tower and gift table request with no problem. They even provided a coat rack, which I completely forgot to ask about!  My one quibble is that they gave us the wrong menu. They gave us the more expensive menu but only charged us for the cheaper menu we ordered, so obviously I'm not upset. I was also a little surprised that coffee and tea weren't included, but it didn't add that much more to the bill.   We also had brunch on the patio about a month ago. The patio is really beautiful and the food was just as excellent. You have to try the Welsh rarebit!"}
{"text":"Excellent creme brulee...  http://omnomtaro.blogspot.ca/2013/05/review-peter-pan-bistro.html"}
{"text":"I don't have a clue why this place has only 3 1/2 stars on Yelp as I write this. My wife and I had brunch there today and we could not have enjoyed it more. The food was excellent in quality, taste and presentation. We can recommend the scrambled eggs with lox, Marscapone, delightfully crisped capers, and crusty toast. Also, the scones with homemade mixed-berry jam, the fresh-squeezed juices, and more. The service was excellent--friendly and efficient. Every staff person we dealt with - - four in total - - couldn't have been nicer. Even though they were busy, the wait for the food was not long, and no one made us feel rushed. All-in-all, a five-star experience."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I was here a little while ago for dinner and everything was delicious. Went back for brunch recently - this place has to be one of the best brunch spots in the city. Plus they have a patio!   The scones and jam are to die for. I had the shakshuka and it was done perfectly - a rarity in Toronto! The dollop of labneh on top added a nice flavour combo. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! We have been there for brunch a couple of times. The french toast is the best I've tried. The goat cheese and spinach omelette is also one of my favorite dishes."}
{"text":"Do NOT miss this Gem! My date and I were on our way to another restaurant, and on a glance, read the menu at Peter Pan Bistro. Best. life. choice. The other venue was quickly forgotten as we were warmly welcomed in, and shown to the back patio. The atmosphere was perfect, calm and inviting, simply but tastefully decorated. The service from Marshall was impeccable. His general culinary knowledge, and explanation of the menu in particular, was very impressive. Thank you for being patient while I asked my questions Marshall! I had the Mussel salad to start, and Halibut cheek for an Entree, and I was not disappointed! The exact opposite, I am still raving about it!The salad was fresh and well seasoned, and the Halibut was by far the best fish I have ever eaten. This is a safe opinion, as I am lucky enough to have traveled the world for a living. In addition to it's charming corner location on Queen Street, this would be the perfect space for any Corporate or private function. There is an additional level on the second floor that can accommodate larger parties. The service, the food, and the genuinely lovely hospitality make this restaurant a 5* - try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"I love this place ! I have been eating here on and off since the 1980' s . The quality of the food is always fantastic . Always innovative and yet not overpriced or intimidating .  Really this is one of the most underrated restaurants in the Toronto food scene !"}
{"text":"Fact: I've been walking past this Queen Street bistro for years and stepped in for the first time,for lunch, two days ago: Wow...I've been missing out on the best quesadilla's ever (cheesy, steamy goodness? Check. Savory? Check. Ample amount of sour cream side-serving? Check). The filling of the quesadilla was so appetizing, the portion amount was substantial (enough to stuff me, and leave enough to doggy-bag home for my boyfriend....who raved about the tastiness of the leftovers) and the price incredibly reasonable. I noticed that the cesar salad my friend ordered looked delicious, complete with bodacious leafy greens topped with huge slivers of parm, and she remarked on the ample size of the serving.       Love sitting in booth's? Me too! Dating and single and looking for a casual, charming place to have a little \"getting to know you session\" over lunch or dinner? This place is it! The atmosphere qualifies as being definitively \" cozy bistro\" complete with a well-worn, much-loved vibe. Bonus: a cute outdoor patio, with the requisite amount of flaura and fauna, and the sounds of the city hovering comfortably over the fence.       So: judging from how my friend's were raving about their meals and the chattering of a packed Friday lunch crowd, I'm willing to bet the other dishes on the menu were equally as delicious.       In terms of service, our waitress, although obviously very busy, was polite, attentive and our meal was quickly served, the dishes all coming out together, in perfect synchronicity (awful, isn't it, when you're out eating and everyone's plates arrive, while you are left to chew on your own fist? Hate that).       Nothing communicates \"successful restaurant\" faster than a bustling, eating, chattering crowd of patrons, all smiling into their plates and eating like lions: this is the scene at Peter Ban Bistro: Go!"}
{"text":"A cute little date night spot.   The environment is very dim at night for dinner and has a romantic vibe with delicate pieces of cutlery and glasses. Everything that was in the restaurant resembled a fairytale like cafe. The service was friendly and the food was good. I enjoyed the appetizers more than the main course however. I ordered a Rarebit burger and a side of kale, the side was on the saltier side and the rarebit burger may not suit all tastes. I would go back to try other items on the menu and it seems that they have different menus every so often to use the ingredients in season.   I would recommend this cafe for an intimate dinner with your bestfriend or your significant other."}
{"text":"Horrible service, unattentive waitress, and extremely greasy food.   I have always wanted to try this place, it looks cute from the outside.., but that's about it. Went there during the evening.  Our waitress was wearing clothes that did not match the atomsphere, and we could tell she was not very enthusiastic about serving us. The menu was very small, and they had another hand written and photocopied menu on the side, which was impossible to read.   I ordered pork tenderlion, it was okay nothing special, but it came with mashed potatoes that was DROWNED in butter, I swear there was probably more butter than potato itself.  My boyfriend ordered the a lamb entree, that contained cous cous and almonds. He hated it, and kept complaining the whole time how horrible it was. After the dinner, he wanted to just get a hotdog from a hotdog vendor because he was not satisfied at all.   The prices of our entrees were definately NOT worth it.  And the waitresses did not make it any better."}
{"text":"I walked past this place many times and had been wanting to try it for a while. The large window by the entrance gives an idea of a cozy ambience lit by candle lights.  Once I walked in, my first impression wasn't so pleasant. There was a weird smell which I couldn't quite identify. Decided to give it a chance anyway and we ordered some food. The pasta I had was very unimpressive, considering it's supposed to be one of their specialties. Pricing is not bad, but I can honestly cook something tastier myself.   The whole experience was sort of a letdown."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last week with a friend.  THe service was good (altho the restaurant was pretty empty)  I thought it was a cute place and everything on the menu sounded interesting. I ordered a spaghetti dish with olive oil and vegetables. I thought it was okay - a bit pricey for what it was."}
{"text":"We were drawn to Peter Pan for lunch by their window advertising lunch pasta for $7.95. However, the menu and waiter confirmed that only one pasta, not all pastas, was available for that price point. This was a bit disappointing since we were hoping for an inexpensive lunch. In the end our meals were tasty and the back courtyard is quaint and perfect for a quiet lunch."}
{"text":"The place has a great brunch. Everything we tried was delicious. I had the burger which was easily my favourite burger I've had in Toronto other than Holy Chucks and Burgers Priest. Friendly service. Great food. Cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"My son & I went to Peter Pan Bistro for dinner last night. It is a new restaurant on Queens St. W. The food was amazing and the service was spectacular!  We started with Crispy Pig's Skin, followed by appetizers Bone Marrow Pizza (my son had a green salad). For the main course I had Herb Crusted Lamb's Belly and my son had the Gnocchi. We shared a Rhubarb Tasting and a Pecan Chocolate Tart for dessert.  Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection. This was truly a gourmet dinning experience.  To top it off we had all of this for less than $100 (with wine). I have a new favourite restaurant in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Sad to see the decline of what used to be a reliable spot on Queen West.  Dropped in with a few friends recently for lunch the other day and the experience took almost two hours.  It looked like a combination of service and kitchen issues.  People who came in after we did received their food before us.  It took forever for them to deliver water and then taking our order took another 15 minutes.  The food, when it came, was below the standard I've come to expect from them - both in quantity and quality.  And to top it off, when we left cash for the bill and the tip, the server brought it back to the table to ask us why we had only left a minimal tip.  Ballsy move, which I could have appreciated had we been high-maintenance customers (which we were not).  This used to be a fave business lunch place for me, but no longer - there are far better options in that part of town."}
{"text":"Decoration, lights, service, food... EXCELLENT! Peter Pan has been my choice several Sundays for brunch with friends and family."}
{"text":"Great decor, super high ceilings with the same pressed tin that the old Peter Pan had.   Yes the booths are still straight backed but they're now more spaced out AND they raised the tables so you no longer knock your knees on their underside.  Chef Noah Goldberg has some serious skill. The Lamb was perfectly cooked. Be sure to try the Madelines. They literally evaporated into thin air leaving only a a sweet lemony aftertaste as proof of their existence.  The dining room staff were attentive - maybe even a little too attentive - but understandable as it was only their second day open.  Overall, great location, excellent food, good service and overall nice vibe. I wish them luck!"}
{"text":"It was my friend's 19 birthday today, and she decided that we should all have a girls dinner there. My friend and I bought her an ice cream cake, and we told the waitress to put it in the freezer and keep it COLD. She said okay, and she told us that there will be a plating fee, but during those 2 hours we were there, she never bothered to inform us of the specific amount.  The food was slow, and the waitresses' attitude was horrible. When the time came for us to light up the cake, we opened the box, and was appalled to see that 1/3 of the cake had melted. It honestly looked like someone took a big dump all over it. We decided to go ahead and cut the cake, and it was incredibly mushy with a hole in the centre. When she gave us the bill, she charged us 2 dollars per person for the plating fee, and with 11 of us there 22 dollars was sufficient to buy a new cake. We told her that we were not pleased with the melted cake and should not be charged with the 2 dollars, and she just waved us off and said something along the lines of \"Well, that was the freezer's problem. But as far as I'm concerned, the 2 dollars we'll be charging because that's what we do.\" She ALSO auto charged a 15% tip, so we couldn't even express our dissatisfaction in the service through paying little tips!!!!"}
{"text":"First time I came here was on New Years day for brunch with my roommate and we had the best time. We only waited 15 minutes to be seated, our server was great, mimosas were $8 which were the cheapest ones we found that day (cheap mimosas was really the only thing we were looking for), and the french toast was the best thing I've ever had!! I told my roommate that I would have shared it but it was too good and I ate it way too fast.   However, the second time I went I got the eggs benny... and it seemed kind of under seasoned and was missing that wow factor I had with my french toast the first time. I mean it was still good but the french toast was by far the best!"}
{"text":"Bland, lifeless, uninteresting food. Can't understand how anyone could like this place. Service was good though."}
{"text":"I had the beet salad and veal cheeks here, wow! Tasty food, excellent service and a good wine list. I will definitely be returning  A note for the allergic among us - I have life-threatening peanut, nut, and shellfish allergies. My server and the kitchen were very accommodating and obviously prepared to handle guests with severe allergies, and I would definitely recommend them based on my experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely AMAZING, and is, in my opinion, wrongly underrated! We were able to make reservations for 12 via phone (online reservations available for 6 people or less). We were connected with Alexandra Phillips, the General Manager, who designed a menu that accommodating, and was fit for our group with no problem! Their menu also changes weekly, depending on what is in season.   The service was amazing, and their friendly coordination made organizing a big dinner so easy! Our water glasses were never empty, and despite being a big group, we all felt well taken care of. They have a long list of wine, with their very own wine director, as well as a creative cocktail list, and good selection of beer.   Now for the FOOD!   ***Disclaimer: I LOVED EVERYTHING I HAD THERE!  Gin Popcorn: Oddly enough, this warm popcorn was SO FLAVORFUL. Definitely order it to snack on while you wait.  Nicoise Salad: This French salad was delicious. Good balance of flavors, with tuna confit, green and yellow beans, fingerling potatoes, and olives.  Grilled Asparagus: over easy duck egg. enough said! Zuchini Salad: Hard to describe, but it definitely is not what you expect. Its partly fried, but still light, with goat yogurt, and a sherry vinaigrette.  Duck: MMM! The roasted duck breast was served over confit leg, plums, grapes, watercress, and pickle walnuts. AMAZING. Definitely order this! My friends also order the Gnocchi, steak frites (came with housemade ketchup and mayo), and LOVED IT. Both served on a cast iron. Get a side of fries, they hit the spot!  For dessert,  Strawberries and Cream: the strawberries and sweet sauce is over a shortbread cookie, in a cast iron, with a side of strawberry and basil ice cream! It was SO GOOD!  I will definitely go back and try the madelines next time!  They have a decent sized patio! They are closed on Mondays, but are open for lunch on weekdays, and BRUNCH on Sat and Sunday! I am definitely going back for brunch! HIGHLY RECOMMEND, for small catch-ups/dates, and large group gathering! Good job Noah Goldberg (executive chef)."}
{"text":"Cozy, comfortable and wonderful. I was walking down the street looking for a place to eat and this place caught my eye. It looked and felt like it could have been on Jane St. in NYC. I tried to keep it simple and light so I started with a cup of soup and the Greek salad and both were perfect, along with some wine and scrumptious bread. I contemplated a heartier entr√©e but opted for the tiramisu and espresso. Perfect. The staff was nice, polite and attentive, giving me an overall very good dining experience. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Great night out with a girlfriend in early September 2011. The $20 prix fixe was a steal with a goat cheese and pear mixed green salad to start, a safron paella with salmon, mussels and red peppers, and tiramisu for dessert. Staff were welcoming, friendly, super attentive (clearing plates, refilling glasses of water and coffee cups exactly when needed), and really seemd to work as a team. Good vibes all around. Apparently there's a $15 prix fixe lunch as well. The menu was an interesting read. I'll definitely be returning with good company to Peter Pan to try more dishes. I know it's now somewhat known in the city, but Peter Pan also just seems to be a place that people walk by without thinking twice. Well, throughout the evening, dish after dish and pleasant interaction after pleasant interaction with staff, I couldn't help but feel that I had found a hidden treasure in this city - a special place where I could gleefully enjoy wonderful dishes served in a charming atmosphere at a superb value. Well done, Peter Pan! Until we meet again."}
{"text":"Cute little bistro on Queen street.  Check out the menu, which changes regularly to see if there is anything you like before heading in.  The food is consistently good and so is the service.  The calamari is great, if thats on the menu.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious with some friends, and our meals were actually a joke. I know winterlicious can be hit or miss, but rarely do I walk away from a 25 dollar dinner feeling ripped off! THe little food we were served came out cold, the lamb stew I had as my main had 2 little chunks of meat, one slice of carrot, and one slice of celery. It was the saddest little entree I've ever seen. I've heard this place does not need to count of repeat business because it's frequented mostly by tourists shopping on queen west. Ain't that the truth!"}
{"text":"They were serving gin forward cocktails when I was there and I like gin so, was content.   We shared their popcorn which seems a little pricy for the amount you get. I had their pork belly dish and my cousin had their risotto and one of their salads. Both of us were pretty happy. The sauces that came with various things were super tasty and I love dipping things, always appreciated. It was a nice place to go before seeing a movie so high fives all around."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place for brunch. Cute place, nice atmosphere.   We started with some scones and they were sooo good.   A bit on the pricier side (2 for $8) but they were so fresh and melted in my mouth. Service was attentive and not overbearing. We all enjoyed our meals. I had the BLT sandwich which was pretty good..bread was a bit burnt for me but some people like that. The fried chicken sandwich was served on a delicious biscuit that tasted a bit like corn bread but so damn good. I would go back just for the biscuit and scones.   Looking forward to returning and trying other items on the brunch menu!"}
{"text":"A great find in downtown Toronto! went here for brunch and loved the little patio at the back..."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner. The servers were friendly but menu was basic and a little pricy and the food was over salted!   There are much better options in the area..."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 7.5/10 Food: 7/10 Atmosphere: 7.5/10 Service: 8/10  Brunch in Toronto is quite a fickle thing. You have your amazing places, at which you are guaranteed to wait at least 1.5 hours for a table for 2. Then there are okay places that will juuuust satisfy the craving (if at least for the day, or until the next lazy Sunday rolls around). Unfortunately, Peter Pan falls into the latter category for me.   I had the shakshuka. It was fine but lacked flavour I would normally expect. The service was normal/good.   THE BOTTOM LINE: nothing to write home about, but fine all the same."}
{"text":"Would definitely come back.  The portions were very generous. The calamari has a really nice light batter, which comes with a nicely lightly dressed salad. The mussels were fresh with a nicely complementary sauce with bacon and green onion. The lamb stew was good with the lamb still reasonably firm.  Service was attentive and friendly.  The booth seats are not as comfortable as they looked, but fine. The atmosphere was nice and not too noisy (though admittedly the restaurant was not full at the time)."}
{"text":"Talk about a place where the food is so good that you'd think Peter Pan actually came and took you to Neverland! Walking on Queen Street, I needed a place for brunch so I just happened to walk in here, and I'm so glad I did.   The location is perfectly situated at the corner of Peter and Queen with a very intimate ambiance. Perfect for dates or even just a brunch/breakfast with a friend or by yourself. It is a little more classier than your average brunch/breakfast spots with every main on the menu above $10.  I decided to go with the Fried Chicken sandwich and when you see a sandwich on the menu, you expect a piece of chicken between two pieces of bread. I'm so glad I was wrong! It's basically their take on fried chicken and waffles however, instead of waffles they have a great soaked bun/biscuit. Absolutely loved it! The chicken was perfectly deep fried and the maple syrup was a great touch. My only critique would be the fries which were a bit too oily and over fried.   The service was exceptional as well! Sitting by the bar, the bartender was very polite and made sure I had everything I needed. Definitely would recommend this to anyone and I'm definitely going back here for a date morning."}
{"text":"Good and service was good. It's a nice environment that didn't feel too busy either.  Fried chicken sandwich was ok but I enjoyed it all the same."}
{"text":"We came in as a group of 8 for a birthday dinner and we have ordered a bit of everything off of the menu. Everybody at the table was satisfied and they have good selection of wine and beer.   Recommended: Duck Steak (A bit too chewy for medium rare) Seafood platter (Shrimp, squid, fish, mussels with potatoes) Mussels with spinach on top  Stay away from the burger which was so-so, order something else instead  Overall service was attentive and had no problem serving big group. Will come back to try other items on the menu and apparently, they update the menu once in a while."}
{"text":"Cute little bistro!! I ordered the French toast and it was really good portions. The place was a little busy when I went in the morning but I got a table within 3 minuets of waiting. The staff was nice and pleasant and I would definitely recommend! 11/10 would go back!!"}
{"text":"It was beyond terrible. Duck breast was unidentifiable, tasted like it was reheated and it was so chewy I sent it back. No apologies or even offer to make something else when I sent it back (i ate the pureed parsnips and veg though. They were nice!). Risotto abounds with confusing and ill selected flavours. The burger would be excellent except we weren't sure if the acrid, fermented flavour was from the chutney, the worchestershire sauce or the cheese.  Honestly, will never go back to eat there. Cocktails only - very cute location. Great date spot, awesome event venue, kind of not expecting dinner to be such a let down."}
{"text":"Peut faire mieux. Ambiance sympa et bon service mais saumon trop cuit et pieuvre sablonneuse. Menu vraiment int√©ressant, quoique portions petites... type Resto fran√ßais. Si les cuissons avaient √©t√© √† point, ce serait une chaude recommandation... Tout au plus, je recommande si vous passer devant et n'avez pas fait de recherche, ce sera une belle soir√©e tout de m√™me !"}
{"text":"I love this little neighbourhood resto. The menu changes every week (some items on the menu will stay the same) so there's always something new to discover there.  My personal favorites are the Devils on horseback (bacon wrapped dates) soo delish! Honestly everything is good there the chef creates some really unique dishes and if you are a true foodie/food lover you'll really enjoy the food here."}
{"text":"This little restaurant had been around since I don't know when.  Its one of those restaurant that you will keep coming back because of the cozy ambience and good food and very reasonably priced.  It is also located in the hipster areas near Queens and Spadina."}
{"text":"The 'Pan continue to have a strong showing for both dinner and brunch. The Salmon rosti topped with arugula is amazing! I was there recently for dinner and the specials were so interesting. A Nicoise salad with steak replacing the role of tuna.  The appetizer flatbread was a spicy, fresh summer meal.  Beer on tap is limited to Amster'dam, so could be better, but wines and mixed drink menus are extensive."}
{"text":"I went here at the end of the summer and decided to eat on the patio for dinner.   While waiting for our food an extremely large rat scampered by on the railing of the fence, right next to two diners.  We were all pretty freaked out.  We told the waitress and she seemed suprised and emberassed but did not apologise.  The back patio was not that nice either, seemed a bit unkempt.  Regretted eating out there for sure.  Our food came.  My friend seemed pleased with her personal pizza, my pasta however was not that good.  It was all spicy and no flavour.  It had no meat but was not a satisfying vegetarian dish.  The inside seems nicer than the outside, if I were to return, I'd eat inside.  I would only go back if people I was with insisted on going again.  Menu was a bit pricy for the food that was offered."}
{"text":"This place is super nice inside, and much more spacious than it appears from the outside which is a bonus as that usually equates to less time waiting to be seated.  The service and food coming out is equally has quick.   On walking in notice the wall deco, super cool, and that attention to detail is a reoccurring theme with the seating and cutlery.  I had the eggs benedict which was good, but not the best i have had. One of my buddies had the peameal bacon sandwich after creeping on another customer's table. It looked great and he said it was good so i would probably try that next time.  If you look at the website for the bistro they have a real cool picture of that corner from way back."}
{"text":"A friend and I were walking along Queen street and decided to eat here on a whim. I found the choices on the menu to be quite limited. My friend was the one who chose this restaurant but she actually wanted to leave once she saw the menu, as she had a hard time picking something that she wanted. They also sold out of one of the apps that she wanted. I didn't want to walk out so she settled on a soup and salad and I had the octopus. Unfortunately, there was nothing special about the octopus. I've definitely had better for less than $28. The dish was pretty underwhelming in flavour. My friend also didn't really enjoy her kale ceaser or sweet pea soup, and found her salad to be overly salty. Service was super friendly, but I don't see myself visiting again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Peter Pan goes beyond a simple meal. The attentive staff and family-operated atmosphere offer a dining experience which is a true delight.  This restaurant was the location of a first-date with my now fiancee, and was the host of my proposal 3 years later, The upper floor event space offers a beautiful locale to host a wedding reception or event, and I look forward to celebrating many anniversaries to come at Peter Pan.  Highlights from the menu are the beet salad, beef tenderloin and roasted salmon."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch. The service wasn't very good and honestly the fried chicken sandwich I got also wasn't good. The chicken tasted like it was breaded exactly like the frozen chicken fingers are.   I also got an orange mimosa and it wasn't great."}
{"text":"I read about Peter Pan Bistro on Yelp, so decided to come for a Saturday morning brunch with my boyfriend. We arrived and heard there was a 30 minute wait, but asked to be seated at the counter as there was space there, so managed to bypass the wait! It wasn't the most comfortable place to sit, but we were hungry and didn't have tons of time so it was a good compromise.  We started with lattes, which were average. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken sandwich, which he enjoyed. The fries were also good. I ordered the vegetarian eggs benedict, and maybe this is partly my fault for not asking, but I was really disappointed with it. When I picture vegetarian eggs benny, I think of spinach, mushrooms, or various beautiful saut√©ed vegetables taking the place of the meat. Even avocado would be fine. However, this was served with a slice of tomato instead of the ham/salmon. I love tomatoes, but they have no place in eggs benedict. It is completely the wrong flavour, and also I really object to paying the same as someone who had ordered this dish with ham or salmon. They either need to re-price the vegetarian version, or just make it with something that would be exciting and delicious, and actually fits with the dish. I should have asked what the vegetarian substitute for the meat was, but because I guess I'm used to more innovative substitutes I didn't even think to. I would have been much happier with the omelette or shakshuka, both of which sounded great. Also, the hollandaise was quite watery, and I much prefer a richer sauce. The potato was fine.   This is such a bummer as the place itself is so cute, and right on Queen W. Also the service was so nice! Overall, sadly a bit of a disappointing, overpriced brunch."}
{"text":"There's a thin line between a Hipster  and a run down restaurant and this is the latter. One of our dishes was the shukshuka. One of my favourite foods and this was terrible. Picture a can of tomato sauce moxies with a liter of water and two eggs placed on top. The eggs Benedict was overcooked and the bread and potato was burnt. On top of that their prices are outrageous for the garbage offered.   Pros: - staff was polite  Cons: - Pricey for the quantity and quality offered - Food tastes very bland. Tasteless - Wooden seats were very uncomfortable"}
{"text":"*update*  The madeleines are so fresh and delicious, but the lemony curd is what really makes it!! You do have to wait about 15 mins for them to come out since the make them fresh for you, but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently good, with attentive service. I love that it's not trendy or overly crowded but right in the heart of downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"I think old Peter Pan is a classic queen w spot. Fits in perfectly w the neighbourhood. Food is quite good, it does the classics well. When I went I had the apple grilled cheese with salad. YUM. The server u had was lovely and rememberd me Next time I went and asked how school was going I thought it was very nice and made it seem very homey. Pricing was very fair for the area and a great lunch spot when shopping on queen west or dT."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a quick bite with my husband the other day, we were blown away! The menu was fantastic, we had the pig skin, scotch eggs and duck tongues. All was absolutely delicious! My husband is a chef and could not stop talking about how impressive the menu was.  I have been before but it was prior to their renovations, now it is much brighter and much more classy, they pay attention to the little details that make the experience that much better. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I was shopping on Queen Street but couldn't shop \"properly\" because I got hungry, so my friend and I came across this cute little place. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by such a sweet lady with an Scottish accent, she was so bubbly, I just loved her. She let us sit anywhere we would like, so I chose the table right at the front near the plants and flowers. While we looked through the evening menu, we were given complimentry bread with oil vinegar dip. She dropped off two waters and was ready to take our order. I decided to start off with creamy tomato soup and for my main chicken penne. As soon as I got the soup, it was hot and delicious! After about 10 minutes my chicken penne was served and it was spicy and straight up awesome! I loved how the jerk chicken was incorporated in the penne with the corn and onions, it was great! My Scottish beauty came by to ask if everything was fine and asked if I wanted to try their signature cocktails, so I happened to get \"The Pink Lemonade\" and it went perfectly with my food. Also, my friend ordered the Salmon with roasted potatoes and asparagus and gave me some, and it was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Overall I really enjoyed this place, just wished they had better lighting and comfortable chairs. Also simple, magical decor might amp up the ambience... after all what does Peter Pan have to do with this place? I'm curious? I will come back for answers and more food ;)"}
{"text":"Dinner review: This restaurant is not just a pretty face. Great food, great service.  Oysters, Beet salad, Lamb belly, Duck breast, the Madeleines (with lemony lavender curd!), the poached plums. Very satisfied.  Thanks for bringing the classy back to Queen West."}
{"text":"Wow what a great revamp. The place looks great and the food was delicious. Had the braised beef rib. Melt in your mouth appetizer salmon roulade and latke. Welsh rarebit with cavier!!! We were treated well by all. Thank you Isabelle. Really all quite good. I'll be back and telling all."}
{"text":"While shooting a music video at the Rivoli Cafe & Club a few doors down, the cast and crew decided we'd split up to not over do the staff.  We chose Peter Pans and did not expect much but the old church benches made for very uncomfortable seating but drinks and bread was so good id recommend this place for that. Food was over-cooked and service could have been better."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict with lux was my dish. The taste was super the service was in top and the coffee had a really nice taste of chocolate in it.  The people around were super cool and all around Toronto is just wonderful. Keep up the good work. Oh and the hash brown was pretty good as well :-)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places, try the chicken breast box. The house salad has one of the best salad dressings and they have great fries. The chicken is always cooked to perfection. Even the dips are great.  My go-to for take out."}
{"text":"My review is base solely on my lunchtime experiences, but they are many. Since the makeover and takeover, this place has become a regular for me. The decor is great, and the renovated deco booths and bar are gorgeous. The lunch menu is small, but perfectly formed, and one of these days I'll stick around for an evening meal for sure!"}
{"text":"Peter Pan isn't quite as phantasmagorical as  the name would suggest it to be.  Indeed, the interior decor does remind you of something out of Jumanji, with the animal heads stretching into the rug-designed wallpaper at the front.  Yes, the service is prompt and the staff members are quite welcoming.  However, the food selection, price, portion size, and quality are points of concern.  The food selection is restricted to a 3 course meal menu or a one-page a la carte menu.  With many of the a la carte items priced at over 20 dollars, which is a hefty cost, the 35 dollar fee for the three course meal seems reasonable - but not in comparison to other meal sets you could find in the area.  Furthermore, the portion size is small, so the price to portion ratio is unbalanced.  One would then assume that  the quality of the food would be high to justify the price.  However, that fell flat as well.  I would not say the burgers we had were terrible; they were just decent at best, with their dry, slightly burnt buns and lack of toppings.  The burgers were 18 dollars each and came with a very small side of fries (you can substitute the fries with a green salad).  Normally, after spending such a high price for an average meal, we would be done for the night, but the burgers just weren't filling enough.  Therefore, we left for seconds at another joint with more reasonable price to portion ratios, selection, and quality."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, the carpets on the wall are nice ! We made a reservation on a Wednesday night - late souper. Service was ok, not more but the food was disappointing. Steak was cold and already cut in half (who does that ?). Pasta was very oily. Wine list ok but not very elaborated.  Not the best spot in Toronto, but not the worst either."}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance and service. Presentation was beautiful. My salade ni√ßoise was really bad though. Not recommended. It has an anchovy dressing, which should have given it away but it smelled horrible. I was on a date and didn't want to complain, but the tuna steaks were also cold and raw (seared on the exterior?) and I didn't expect that. If the menu explained it better I would have chose otherwise. I think I'm spoiled having tried this salad first in Nice so nothing compares, but my anchovy loving boyfriend couldn't even take the smell of the salad. Truly gross! It almost smelled like the dressing went off. Liked the quail eggs though :)"}
{"text":"Definitely make a reservation here for the weekends. We had a 45 min wait for a table for 3. To be expected for such a good brunch. It was well worth the wait though!   We got delicious scones and all got Eggs Benedict. Once we were in, the food came pretty quickly and the staff were very friendly and helpful!   They didn't have a ton of vegetarian options but the classic egg dishes looked great!   I can highly recommend this as a great brunch spot  and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came here on a quiet night, occupying only 1 of 2 tables and the service was absolutely terrible. The patron of the other table literally had to get up and \"interrupt\" the gossiping waitress just to get their bill.   Another server decided to do a fashion show to her friends in the back and also was loudly making cell phone calls. To top it off, she rested her shoes up on the bar area.   The only good thing is that the food was decent."}
{"text":"This is a perfect lunch-with-your-best-mate, casual lunch spot. The lunch specials are nice, easy, not intimidating, and cheap! I had a delicious BLT type sandwich with salad (choice of fries) for $10. They also had gourmet pizza's, quesadilla's, salad's, soup's etc.   The service is good enough - I didn't notice anything bad, but I didn't notice anything spectacular, you know?!   I'd like to try a supper there as the ambiance looks great whenever I walk by...that's right I stare inside as I pass! Don't act like you don't!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Had the eggs Benedict which was divine. The sauce was so tasty and complimented the Home made hash brown that gets served alongside. The scones were also a good treat. Must go!"}
{"text":"The prix fixe wasn't worth it. I got salmon and it was overly salty. My pal got the risotto that was also very salty and mostly tasted like cheese. The appetizers were good at least, the pumpkin soup was slightly sweet and the beet salad was fresh. We got the madelines and they came with a lavender lemon sauce which tastes solely like lemon. But the madelines itself were very fresh and out of the oven."}
{"text":"Our server was a lovely young lady, and in general the staff are very friendly & helpful. The menu, on the other hand, did not delight me. It was adequate, but there really wasn't that much choice if one is vegetarian or looking for a dairy free option.  I had the spagetti with meatballs, and it was alright, nothing great about it. The 2 meatballs were a tad hard and were not very flavourful. The sauce quantity was good, I don't like my pasta to be drowning in tomato juices.  The atmosphere was excellent for a hot, lazy saturday afternoon. But this isn't the place to go if you are on a bit of a budget."}
{"text":"We were here for brunch. I found the ambience to be great and the service friendly. The food was hit and miss. We ordered two courses of their three course brunch special. I had fish and chips and my friend an open face chicken sandwich. While her dish was tasty and filling I found mine to be less than spectacular. It had a single piece of fried fish and it was oily and not very good. The dessert course on the other hand was rhubarb and custard filled tart with a perfect crust and very delicious. I enjoyed a cappuccino after. I will return if I am in the vicinity, but not in a rush."}
{"text":"My friend and I were  looking for a quick place to grab a meal on Queen St and stumbled upon Peter Pan. It was over the holidays, on a day many other restaurants in the area were closed, so it was a relief to find this one open!  The interior was warm and inviting, wooden booths along the wall, and a few open tables. Our waitress greeted us immediately, and was very quick taking our order. The issue that night is they were out of a 'few things' on the menu. I ordered the sliders (sans bacon, were out of that) without much trouble. However my friend had to re-order her meal 3 times, as the waitress came back apologizing that the previous options were not available tonight! She ended up with the Mac and Cheese.  My sliders were ok. They were good sized for sliders, with large patties, thick buns, and lots of toppings. But I found them pretty heavy/greasy to eat. They could of used a leaner choice of ground beef. They are also on the appetizer menu..I highly recommend sharing if you ordered them as actual appetizers, i dont know how you would make it to the main course!  My friend said her mac and cheese was 'good'.   All in all, an ok dining experience. Service was good, but I found my meal pretty heavy, and overall the menu uninspiring. I would return if stuck for a place to eat again, but wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Came in for a late brunch on a Saturday. The French toast was really good. Came topped with Apple which was a great touch. Not a fan of the scrambled eggs. Make sure to grab mimosas.   On the pricy side, though!"}
{"text":"Great little bistro in Toronto. it's cute and quaint, but seating is a bit scarce, and the hours are a tad limited. We came here for brunch, though, and loved the food. The menu is constantly changing, but this ensures everything is made with fresh and local ingredients, so don't be afraid to be a little adventurous! Just be warned; the place is cash only! This almost caught us when we went here, so be prepared. Overall, however, it's a great little place in Toronto that I recommend."}
{"text":"Peter Pan's food was fantastic, and the servers were lovely people who were very friendly and attentive. The only downside was that it was cash only, which can catch you off-guard if you're not from the area!"}
{"text":"Made reservation for tuesday 7pm, somewhat crowded  Entree: short ribs 5/5 It took 30min to arrive but worth it The ribs are tender and delicious Portion is small so its not filling, will likely need dessert"}
{"text":"Solid place. Great cocktails. If I recall correctly the tonic water was house made and solid.  Steak frites on point."}
{"text":"i love this place. every time i am in toronto, i am sure to eat here at least once if not twice or more.  i love the comfort and diversity of the menu. the specials are often great, and they carry some delightful wines (perrin is particularly good).  their treatment of red meat is also among the better places i've enjoyed.  (e.g. medium rare is neither medium nor rare :))  they have some veg options for friends that lean that way, which is always nice. the service has always been pleasant in my experience (i've only eaten here 6 times or so).  super cozy place.  some people go here for dates and others for basic comfort food chill, etc. I tend to the latter. very easy, and doesn't break the bank."}
{"text":"Yummmm! Did a 12:30 p.m. business lunch here today.  I was ill over the weekend so I opted for just the soup, which today was Sweet Potato. MMMM! Beautiful consistency, lovely flavour, very well balanced.   It was quiet, our server was very attentive (like she actually CARED), and the atmosphere was lovely - totally casual but still with an upscale feel. Loved it. Pure class, but not stuffy at ALL.  Everyone stayed calm and quiet, even when, upon arrival, I managed to knock over the entire window display in one fell swoop... it was epic. But everyone just pretended nothing happened - it was beautiful, and very much appreciated.  My co-diners had wonderful-looking lunches, and commented that they enjoyed them very much.   Definitely a cute spot to check out - seems more lunch-y than dinner-y, but it would work for business (as in this case), romance, catching up with friends, or dining solo."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this placed out but never got around to it. When it reopened I added it to my list.  Service was very nice at first but I felt it trailed off towards the end of our stay. Also, the server changed Midway which is odd too.  The food itself, I had this duck stomach wrapped duck. I did not hear that it was duck stomach, and it really was more fatty than I hoped. There pasta dish was quite nice, mushroom stuffed pasta, kinda like a ravioli or agnolotti, but also not quite. It was quite delicious though.  The space itself felt quite comfortable. Everything seemed bright but not too bright. Meant to be there, but not trying to hard."}
{"text":"Having walked by this restaurant numerous time, I sadly paid little attention to it.  I finally had the opportunity to check it out and I'm glad I did!   Luckily my friend got there a little earlier than the time we had planned to meet b/c she managed to snag a table. Basically from when we sat down to when we left there was a continuous line up at the door.  This place is busy to say the least. Their brunch/lunch menu is fairly simple.  I had the Chicken Fried sandwich and my friends had the Pan Hamburger.  The dried chicken sandwich is HUGE...like taller than my head.  I had to de-bun it and eat it with my knife/fork b/c while I have a big mouth it's clearly not that big.   The chicken is nice and crispy, there was cheese melted on it, with greens.  It came with a side of maply syrup, but i like my fried chicken spicy rather than sweet. I would have preferred some heat to the batter, but that's just me.   The fries are those thicker cut ones - these type of fries are personally not my favourite - I'm a sucker for the thin crispy ones.  My friends throughouly enjoyed their burgers - I believe it was rarebit with caramelized onions and tomato chutney   The decor is pretty unusual - wall carpets with animal heads on them, random pictures/mirrors placed around the room.  Interesting to take a look and see what you find.  Service was great considering the place was busy.  I'm definitely curious to try some of their dinner options - taking a look at the menu and it all looks so good!"}
{"text":"Nous avons bruncher un midi et nous avons bien aim√© le lieu et l'ambiance.  Le plat √©tait simple (¬úufs, bacons grill√©s, l√©gumes) mais bon.  B√©mol pour la quantit√© et le prix que j'ai trouv√© un peu cher mais le reste √©tait impeccable. Le service √©tait rapide et les serveurs sympathiques"}
{"text":"Try the cocktails!!! They are truly inspired. We met the  bartender who created the concoctions and his service was impeccable. Our actual bartender mixed our drinks PERFECTLY. We didn't eat this time but from the moment we entered the door, to the moment we left, our experience was flawless. I was told they recently changed owners so if you were disappointed in the past, give them another try.  I highly recommend you park your butt at the bar and start your night out with some truly interesting drinks."}
{"text":"Randomly decided to try this place out. We got the eggs Benedict with avocado.. it was probably the most untastiest (if that's even a word) eggs Benny I've ever had. The hollandaise sauce tasted like mayonnaise. And every bite of it kinda tasted sour.. so gross. The potato was bland, and the salad that came with it barely had any dressing on it. This meal made me pretty sad. Oh, and to top it all off, on this very hot and humid day, my water didn't even come with ice.   Very underwhelmed.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food, cocktails, and service. Definitely has a bistro vibe, cosy as well. I came here with a large group and they offer a nice private dining room upstairs.    The brussels sprout caesar was delicious and the freshly baked madeleines with lemon lavender curd are must haves!"}
{"text":"My pizza, one of the daily specials, was bland, but everyone else at my table seemed to be impressed with their mains, the risotto and two steaks. I admit the seafood risotto looked appetizing, although I don't even like seafood. I just really like risotto.  From what I gather, this is a decent casual place that's good value for money. Many items on the menu look good, and everything's under $20. Just skip the daily pizza special."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the lovely atmosphere and attentive, unpretentious service. The meal was perfectly suited for a cold fall evening: the bread was served with a cooked head of garlic, the cauliflower soup was delicious, the duck confit was marvelous and the chicken was delicious served with fall vegetables. We wandered in by accident and will definitely return next time we are in Toronto."}
{"text":"Service here was excellente! the Pan has an awesome outdoor courtyard, with a few trees and ropes of vine growing up the fences and staircase that border the space. My friend and I were just looking to chat over a bottle of wine, and we asked to sit outside for the ambiance even though there were no other customers out there. Our hostess said sure, and brought us not only the tasty bottle of Malbec we ordered but also two plates of focaccia bread + oil and vinegar to dip into, all on the house.   A little on the 'spensive side (we found the exact same bottle of wine for less than half the price at a liquor store later that night), but the service was quality and I'd definitely recommend checking it out for a nice meal."}
{"text":"TL:DR Nice place but I felt like I was getting pranked by the sight of the food.  not sure how to post photos if you're writing a review from your computer but boy if I could attach a photo of what I got, it would be a joke   So I come here with my friend looking for brunch and we got there a little after 2 (and we failed to realize brunch was finished at 2) no problem it was our fault, the waitress informed us the snack menu was still open so it was no biggie. The ambiance itself is really beautiful and the backyard patio is stunning and it just feels really summertime and luxurious, the food...well...I'll get to that...  My friend ordered something resembling a burger that came with sweet potato fries and the oddest ketchup resembling sauce (which tasted nothing like ketchup and more like Thai chili sauce, to be honest) so that was interesting, to say the least  and I got the \"asparagus salad\"..... Now if I knew a \"salad\" would be considered 4 literal stalks of asparagus with a poached egg on top, I wouldn't have gotten it. I literally felt like I was being pranked. $15 for 4 pieces of asparagus with a poached egg on top.....It's still quite funny to me, to be honest. Now when I think of salad I think of a full salad, especially at $15? but in all seriousness, they should not have their patrons feel like they're being pranked or scammed by the sight of their food.  Our server was a lovely attentive gentleman who often checked up on us, so I didn't have the heart to ruin his day by laughing/complaining at the sight of 4 stalks of asparagus being considered a salad.  Despite it all, it was quite interestingly delicious, but I left thinking that I should have just gone to warehouse down the street (would have saved me 10$ with triple the portion)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch with my girlfriend today and ordered the prix fixe lunch menu: beet salad and grilled salmon. Both were superb. Flavours were amazing and worked together really well. Portions were just right for lunch. They didn't have any dessert available despite listing the tiramisu but luckily this didn't take away from the dining experience itself. Love the ambiance of the restaurant and would definitely make a trip back."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch.  I've tried the Shakshuka, Eggs Benedict and Omelet and they were all super yummy.  The good: - Gorgeous back patio, great for sunny days. Has enough shade and blocks out the downtown noises pretty well. - Classy, vintagey decor, feels like a real french bistro. - Best Washroom in the City (according to my boyfriend, who obsessed over this for a good portion of our meal). Seriously, go check it out. It's pretty minimal, but well decorated, has nice hand-towels and soap/lotion, and overall feels very euro-classy.   The bad: - Main dining hall can be a bit loud. Good ambiance if that's what you're into. Back patio is definitely quieter. - Kinda pricey - but brunch menu was good."}
{"text":"I'm actually really surprised by the other reviews because when I went the food was disappointing. We were seated in the patio, which was nice, but the free \"fresh\" bread wasn't. It was dry, very crumbly, and had a weird taste to it. For my meal, I ordered the salmon with green beans and a side of fingerling potatoes. The potatoes were nicely sauteed, but the rest of my meal was disappointing. The skin on the salmon was not crispy and lacked flavor. The green beans were frozen and still very crunchy, definitely needed a little more time cooking. Our waiter checked up on us a little too often...he literally asked us three times if we were ready to order before we had a chance to even look at the menu.  Don't let the cozy atmosphere and the big windows fool you. The food isn't worth the value."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for it's Winterlicious lunch menu. By far my favourite thing I had here was one of their \"punch\" cocktails. It literally tasted like alcoholic gummy bears - mmm mmm. With that being said, this cocktail was what bumped my review from a 2.5 to a 3.  Had the roasted garlic ricotta stuffed mushrooms, they were alright, but served cold - both my sister & I felt they would be much better if it were a heated dish. Similar to that, the complimentary garlic bread that is served is also served cold, which we felt would be much tastier heated.  For the entree we had Southern California Soft Tacos with pulled smoked chicken, cheddar, Root Beer BBQ sauce, guac, and fresh garden salsa. It was alright, but definitely nothing special. However, the guacamole was easily the best I had ever had! Was really delicious!  For desert we had the sticky toffee pudding, again, was okay but not a stand-out. I felt it was really dry, which was a big putoff.  Overall it was a decent visit, but nothing really stood out about this place. Service was mediocre, food was mediocre, but can't complain too much about a $15 prix fixe menu. Though I don't think I will be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Menu is small and somewhat boring. If you are going to be a \"nice\" restaurant and have spaghetti and meatballs, they should be killer. It was just ok.   This place is pretty good if you are in the neighborhood, not worth travelling to though.   One thing for sure though, pray that you don't have \"Jeff\" as your server. He puts on this brutal fake accent, switching between british and french, and is VERY annoying. His whole demeanor is obnoxious and unfunny, though he seems very confident that he is being charming. Really should be a 2 star review because of him, as he made the entire dining experience that much worse, but that seems harsh.   This was not just my opinion either, the patrons on either side of us were whispering about how annoying he was."}
{"text":"One of the best dinners I've ever had. My family and I stopped in here while visiting Toronto from LA. We ordered several of the recommendations from our server and they were all spot on. We had the steak frites, duck confit, and gnocchi as well as their madeleines for dessert. AHH-MAZING!! I definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend  while we were on a short vacation in Toronto, and I wish we'd been in town long enough to go again - maybe for a weekend brunch. The service on our visit was prompt and friendly, the food was tasty and reasonably priced for the venue.  We got into quite a chat with our server about local wildlife and wines (being from Australia I was very excited to see squirrels for the first time, and was also determined to avoid any Aus/NZ wines while I was in town for a change).  The specials menu had some interesting dishes on it, and looks like it changes regularly - daily I think - it was handwritten and copied which gave it a personal and quirky touch.  While we were there a table near us clearly was celebrating a birthday, and so some Stevie Wonder \"Happy Birthday to You\" was played in the bistro. This made my evening just perfect because I'd not heard it in such a long time, and my parents used to play it on my birthday when I was a child. How could I not love a place that plays Stevie Wonder for someone's birthday?  A sweet little place, with good food and good service. Loved the decor inside, and there is a patio out the back that would be great on a fine summer day."}
{"text":"I came here for a staff Christmas party. There were probably about 70-90 of us. We were hosted upstairs where they keep a private event space. It is not the roomiest of spaces with that amount of people, but it did achieve an intimate feel that I think is nice for a holiday staff party.  I arrived late and the staff immediately got me to coat check and took my drink order while helping me with my belongings. They were very friendly and found me an empty spot and took my order. A+ for service.  I ate a beet salad for my appetizer, which was quite yummy, although I had hoped some goat cheese would make an appearance in it! Nonetheless the glaze on it was quite good and the beets were very fresh. For dinner I had the steak frites, which were yummy. There was some sort of homemade ketchup the staff provided for me. It had sort of an exotic flavor to it and was a nice pairing for the steak flavor. Lastly, I had their sticky toffee pudding. I also got to try their chocolate mousse due to one of my table members leaving early. If I had to pick again I would go with the mousse, but they were both quite good. I was happy with the food. It didn't blow me away, but it was very good.  Overall, I think this is an interesting venue, with excellent service, and a menu that is not particularly innovative, but gives its own spin on things. I can see it being great for winter dates due to its cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab some breakfast along Queen Street. The food was great, but the biscuits and fresh jam were even better. Service was great as well. The animals hanging on the walls were cool too."}
{"text":"Chef Noah does an amazing job with delivering plate after plate.   Loved the patio.  Food was amazing.  Service was spot on for lunch.   Everything was fresh and tasted amazing.   Can't wait to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"The one thing that really stood out to me during a recent brunch at Peter Pan was the exceptional customer service.  They must get training on this, because it was across the board and consistent with everyone we dealt with.  Our server even helped to clean up the mess our 2-yr old son made.  I've never had this happen before while we were still at the table.    The food was great as well.  I tried the eggs benny with a fried disc of shredded potato, and greens. Homemade ketchup, too.  Nice.  Good music, good atmosphere, cool coasters.  A place with Peter Frampton on a coaster (and a cast iron pan on the other, get it?) doesn't take itself too seriously, which is nice."}
{"text":"We love Peter Pan simply because of the atmosphere of the place! They changed hands recently and they've done a really good job revamping the location. Before it was more rustic and slightly more run down, which was still really cute but now they've done a really good job creating a nice little hidden gem, the food is fairly pricer than before so that would be the only down side to the new revamp."}
{"text":"It's a really cozy place with amazing food. The people in the restaurant is great and we really enjoyed our time there!  A must go for a cool brunch!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a good lunch, nice atmosphere and some great people watching if you sit up front.  I have walked by this place a hundred times without realizing it is there. Not until I saw it on CTV's The Listener did I see it and wanted to give it a try.  Now I am sure I will be popping by there regularly for a good unrushed lunch for a surprisingly pleasant price. Their menu is extensive and very appealing, so I have a long list to try."}
{"text":"I had a very peasant experience w Peter Pan Bistro. From the moment I was seated, I could tell that their service was going to be top notch. Throughout the servers were very attentive and polite.  The decor of this place is quite interesting. From the abnormally upright booths to the wall rugs with deer heads, I could not quite figure out the theme for this place.   The food was AMAZING. I ordered the Squash and Pumpkin soup as well as the Fall Barley Risotto, and let me tell you I was impressed. Not only was the presentation impressive, but also the complexity of the flavors. The soup was sweet, smooth, with a nice touch of sour taste with the pickled carrot. The texture of the risotto dish was my favorite, although I was also delighted by the subtle hint of olive.   Bravo, Peter Pan, will be back."}
{"text":"Exploring the streets of Toronto, we stumbled upon this place and had to go in. (Huge Peter Pan fan)  We were welcomed by staff right away and enjoyed a glass of their $10 wine (Special price on Wednesdays).  I ordered their Fish 'N Chips - the fish was perfectly breaded and was not soggy at all. It was crisp and every bite was delicious. Their fries were seasoned nicely and there was more than enough. The portion size was huge!  The environment was simple and elegant and very cozy.  Their washroom was very clean as well!  Glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"Good food but the service was awful. First of all, after we got the food, our waiter never checked with us how we like it and if we needed anything else.   We were sitting with empty coffee mugs for 10 mins and our waiter saw that and was just passing by. When we asked the other waiter that had coffee jar to refill our coffees, she looked at us not nicely and just walked away. Then we asked another waiter to help us and finally got the coffees.   At the end of the meal, I walked to the person at the greeting desk to let her know that I'm not willing to leave the tip as I was not happy with the service. She said she is not of appropriate level and will call the manager to see us. The manager didn't come but just our waiter with the bill and machine. She asked if everything was ok and when I told her that we were not satisfied with the service, especially with her colleague that ignored us, she said we must have misunderstood the situation. She was standing beside me until I paid the bill, it felt like she wanted to make sure that I leave tip. So I left a low 10% tip really should have left nothing.   I then walked to the greeting desk person again and inquired why the manager never came to us. She said that someone still came to us (she was convinced that since our waiter came to inquire our feedback it meant the manager is not needed anymore).   I really wanted to escalate as I felt like employees were covering each other (as there was still some tip, they thought it was not making the case to the manager's attention). Luckily the manager heard the conversation and asked what was wrong. I described the situation and he eventually refunded me the whole bill. Which was entirely not the point as what we really wanted is a sincere apology. Therefore even with the bill refunded we still feel being treated badly and having had a spoiled Sunday brunch. Not willing to come back again and recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I got married at Peter Pan's event space on the second floor in September 2017. I honestly could not have asked for the day to be any more perfect. From the professionalism and organisation by their event co-ordinator Jill, to the delicious food and incredible service staff on the day of, everything was amazing from day one. I would HIGHLY recommend Peter Pan for anyone looking for a super cute wedding venue. They will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere inside. Totally ghetto back patio with basically the junkiest patio furniture of the cheapest plastic one can find and had  a dirty unkempt feel to it.  We sat down in the patio, had a quick review of the menu which revealed $20+ range entries and not a single vegetarian option (besides a few of the starter salads) so we got up and left.  Prices seem high for what is offered so we didn't want to stick around and find out!   The pasta of the day was also not vegetarian."}
{"text":"Bread was warm, but had a strange aftertaste. The food was ok...service was slow during lunch."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise! Great food and service. All the servers were friendly and attentive.   We sat on their patio, which was quiet and intimate.   I was going to do Summerlicious, but their regular menu was so attractive I decided to pay a bit extra for what I really felt like eating. I ordered the crispy asparagus to start (deliciously deep fried like a Japanese tempura) followed by the duck confit parpardelle (featuring a runny duck egg on top). It was a perfect meal. I wish I took pictures!   Would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"wow - i wish i had half the experience that the others did. I was there on oct 21st  for a late lunch. There were 2 waitresses working and we were the 2nd table.  Waited about 15 minutes watching the waitresses chatting and laughing behind the bar before it occurred to someone to take our order.    Brought our greasy, oily, food out eventually...one of them decided it was lunch time for her and sat in a booth eating in the back, the other retreated into the kitchen and basically hid out.  No checking in, no drink refills.  watched 2 tables come in and leave after not getting served and I was really jealous of them.    To try to pay the bill I had to get out of my chair and wave as if I was flagging down an airplane.  worst service I've ever had anywhere.  Spending an hour and a half somewhere to get some eggs is not normal. Never going back."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little cozy and tiny bistro.  I was there on a Sunday morning and had a great brunch. The place was booked out. I sat at the bar.  Place? Fantastic. Old elements creates a special vibe. Something relaxing lies in the air.  Can imagine that due to the fixed bench arrangement a candle light dinner would be wow! :)  Service? Quick, helping, focused. Perfect!  Food? My scrambled eggs with salmon were great. Capuccino as it should be. Just few dishes garantee freshness and quick. My eggs werde very dry. Not as fluffy as perfect scrambled eggs should be.   Furthermore one or two more dishes with eggs are my recommendation for the menu.  Summary: Place to be!"}
{"text":"The food is fine, the service is fine, the atmosphere is fine...blah blah, see what I'm getting at here? Peter Pan Bistro is....just fine.  The servers were nice and generally attentive. The only drawback to service was the long wait for glasses of water (it was really hot out).  As for the food, I would not describe the portions as 'huge'. Though, I went for Summerlicious and it does seem standard for restaurants to half-ass it during those three weeks. Anyways, I got the mushroom strudel, which was pretty good. My date had the chili chicken salad; he said the dressing wasn't that great. We both chose the pulled chicken tacos for our entree. Apart from the fact that you only got one taco, we thought they were really great. The root beer sauce especially. Dessert was extremely underwhelming: lemon poppy seed cake and the chocolate brownie were both incredibly dry.   Overall an alright experience, I'd maybe give it a second shot if a friend desperately wanted to go."}
{"text":"Worst French Toast I have ever had. French Toast tasted like sandwich bread. Salmon Benedict is not fresh. I have no idea why it is four stars in Yelp.."}
{"text":"Their raw oysters are some of the freshest I've had in Toronto and I would also highly recommend their mushroom risotto!"}
{"text":"Average place. It was Ok but not as tasty as it could have been expected based on the list of ingredients. Globally each meal tasted a little bit dry (not enough sauce - but some may prefer such kind of food?).  hamburger was really dry and overcooked (not juicy).  \"ok\" place, really, but unlikely I would go back."}
{"text":"I ordered the eggs benedict with peameal. I love my poached eggs soft/runny. I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but it was the runniest poached eggs i've ever had. even some of the whites were still runny. tasted delicious nonetheless. Salad tasted fresh and healthy but didn't taste bitter. the hashbrowns were pretty cool.  my friend's croque madame looked delicious too."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Delicious food. Everyone was very accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu. The sticky toffee dessert was lovely, not too sweet. We will be back."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for years, but for some reason figured it was touristy and not good due to its location. I was very wrong! This I my new go-to brunch spot in Toronto. Partly because I live around the corner, but also because it's delicious.  So far I've tried the eggs benny and the croque Madame. Both are good - I'm a huge croque Madame fan and this is one of the best I've had in Toronto. The duck egg on top is a nice touch!  To end brunch, I highly recommend an order or madeleines if you still have room. Small, sweet and fresh, and the lemon vanilla custard for dipping is awesome. Seriously - the Madeleines are worth it alone, but this place is offering a great brunch experience all-around.  Oh, and I've never had to wait for a table - never too busy or lined up in my experience, which isn't always easy when it comes to brunch in this city!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this restaurant is pretty nice - it has a cool local vibe. We had friendly service and the food was pretty good.  I haven't had Croque Monsieur before so I thought I would give it a go here, and it's delicious! The bechamel sauce here is thick and creamy and when topped and heated on the sandwich is heaven. Would definitely come back just for that."}
{"text":"I went here for Sunday brunch with 5 friends. It was about a 40 min wait but there is plenty of shops around to browse while you wait. The menu was a great selection. Interior of the restaurant is very cute. Great service as well. Only 2 complaints. 1. The French toast was overpriced. I paid the same for French toast as my friends paid for lox bennies. So if you want your money's worth, get the sandwiches or egg dishes. 2. This restaurant has absolutely nothing to do with Peter Pan. I was expecting at least a shadow on the wall."}
{"text":"Great food, horrible service considering how simple the menu is. Expect 90+ minutes for eggs. Only worth it if you have nothing to do all day."}
{"text":"We hosted a large private event (115+ people for cocktails, hors d'oeuvres and roast meat/sandwiches) last weekend at Peter Pan's upstairs event space. It could not have gone any better. The space (beautiful, airy, and 4 bathrooms!), service and food were all perfect, and all of our guests -- many of whom are pretty demanding/picky and wouldn't hesitate to tell us if they didn't enjoy their time -- loved it.   Logistically the team at Peter Pan was extraordinarily sharp, making sure flow was managed well (i.e. nobody had to wait for drinks, food got around to everyone, bars and seating were well-spaced to avoid crowding, etc...). The arancini, corn dogs, fried chicken and roast-beef carving station were standouts. Even the beer selection was better than your average private event (Sam Adams and Amsterdam Cruiser).   There was really nothing at all to complain about...I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone needing a private event space downtown."}
{"text":"used to go here occaisionally  when I worked close by in the 80's!  the food was always so so but it was a popular place. aside from location could never figure out why."}
{"text":"Very convenient location. Hip decor. Friendly service. Good vibes for Sunday brunch.   We got the omelette and eggs Benedict with permeal. One of the best eggs Benedict I've ever had!   Each dish comes with salad and potatoes so it's a great balance of all the food!   We did have to wait 15 minutes for a seat but considering it's Sunday brunch, that's not too bad."}
{"text":"Peter Pan is always rammed during lunch hour, and with good reason. They serve up hot & tasty lunch specials in a cozy atmosphere, usually for under $10. They advertise pasta specials on their sandwich board signage for less than $10 so that's usually what I get. Good for a quick lunch or business date!"}
{"text":"Interesting menu and my cold pea soup and lamp entree were excellent. Rather limited wine list but overall a great meal for this foreigner who just wandered in with no expectations"}
{"text":"Started my New Year first brunch at this lovely place. The service is great!!! Everyone is so nice, and always come to check if there's anything we need. The food is very well prepared, and delicious. The coffee is pretty strong and unlimited refill.  Overall, a very nice place on Queen Street West!"}
{"text":"The renos are complete, and Peter Pan has been hipsterfied. Their menu is now quite small, but rotates weekly. Ol' Petey is keeping it fresh.   The patio renos look great, the prices are still reasonable for this tourist/office haven and my fried chicken lunch was solid. Nice slaw, Mr. Pan."}
