{"text":"Our family loves brunch and the Bro'Kin Yolk did not disappoint. The menu is loaded with different versions of traditional brunch but also offers items for the more adventurous. I had the Spanish chorizo bowl which was amazing and nothing like any breakfast item I've had before. Their wait list system is so convenient and easy to use and you better use it because this place is always busy! We were offered coffees while we waited for our table which was much appreciated. Every staff member I encountered was very helpful and friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This new location is super popular but they have a good waitlist system. We called at 10am, received a quote (2 hours ish) and then they text you a link and you can see your place in line, and plan accordingly. We planned to arrive at 12 and were seated shortly after. Even if you don't get there in time, they'll just bump you down and you'll get the next table and so on. The food was reasonably priced in my opinion, even a bit cheaper than most popular brunch places in my opinion. I liked the open kitchen concept and the interior is cozy.   My boyfriend and I shared the Truffle, Mushroom & Ham breakfast poutine: twice fried duck fat potatoes, soft poached eggs, roasted garlic hollandaise. We also had the upstream benny (smoked salmon, pickled red onion, basil hollandaise) which was served on a waffle. I thought it'd be weird at first but it was really fluffy and soaked up sauce well.   Overall, I had a good experience and would come back! Parking is good because it's in a plaza."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious and always busy!  I wanted to try here last month so I showed and they said it was going to be a 1.5 hour wait. I wasn't waiting that long so I went somewhere else for breakfast. They gave me a tip that next time I wanted to go there to call ahead and be out on the waitlist. This morning I wanted to go back so at 8:30am I called and good thing I did because it was going to be an hour and fifteen minute wait this time so they said to arrive between 9:45am and 10:00am and then I got right in despite their being many people waiting at the door.  I like their hours being only 7:00am - 3:00pm and I like that their menu is small and only breakfast/ brunch food items.  Today I got the avacado open faced sandwich with about half an avacado on it and it was awesome! Highly recommend this place and all in advance to get on the waitlist."}
{"text":"Really good place. The service is really good and friendly, and the food is interesting and delicious. It's a bit small, so make sure to call in to make a reservation before coming."}
{"text":"The bro'kin yolk was pretty darn good. I was skeptical based on there only being 8 reviews on their page - but I highly recommend this place.   I ate here twice over the course of one week, despite there being several options within a short drive, that's generally a sign of something I've really enjoyed.   The first day I had the Sous Vide fried chicken poutine. This was very enjoyable. The chicken was nicely cooked and surprisingly moist (I had the white meat). The gravy was flavorful and the \"poutine\" was good. It was made with small sliced up potato pieces instead of french fries, but overall it was quite good. I think my one complaint is that it didn't have enough gravy, but I just tend to like a lot on my foods. The eggs were slightly overdone so I didn't get that nice runny yolk, but the flavor was great regardless.   On my second visit I had the eggs benedict with ham and mushrooms. This was served over a belgian waffle instead of over an english muffin and, honestly, this was far better than the poutine. The flavor was on point. It did not require any salt, and overall I didn't feel any pieces were missing.   Service was prompt although the alcohol selection was just so slightly limited. We had a wait on the first day (thursday at around 10AM) and no wait on the second (Sunday at around 130PM) so I'm not sure if that's helpful at all. Overall I really enjoyed it and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love brunch so I was thrilled to see that Bro'Kin Yolk was opening another location in Mahogany, it took them longer then I think they planned to open due to some construction delays but that just built up the anticipation because this place is hopping! Calgarian's do love their brunch so be prepared for it to be busy. They have a good waitlist system though, definitely call ahead and get your name on the list and the wait time, then you get a text and can check on where you are in line. We called at 10 AM and it was an hour 45 for a table, we were planning to be there for 11:30 though so not to bad. The staff were all super friendly and accommodating, we had a baby with us and they had high chairs and put us in a booth, great menu options for the littles and $2.75 little waffles that you can add on. We ordered a farmers breakfast, poutine and the avocado sandwich and everything was very tasty. I thought the prices were decent, at $16 bucks for brunch it's standard. The decor was bright and cheery inside, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have breakfast dates every Sunday as we are early risers.  We used to go to Ricky's in Seton but when Bro'Kin Yolk opened in Mahogany we thought we would give it shot.  And we were not disappointed.  The menu is creative and different. All food is locally sourced. Though you can get typical breakfast fare, I'm not sure why anyone would want to once they see the eclectic mix of available offerings.  The short rib hash is my favorite, but you have to try the chicken and waffles at least once. Your doctor may not like it but your taste buds will love it.  We now go there every Sunday morning for our breakfast date.  Staff is friendly and today we noticed that all six staff members on the floor acknowledged us as we left the restaurant after our meal.   Service has been exceptional since day one."}
{"text":"Very nice and busy place! Remember to call and line up before to go there!! Food come very fast. Foods good but little bit salty, if come with more sauce, I will give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious. I love that they have the mini waffles. I always order it for my daughter. It's perfect since she cant finish a full order.   They are super friendly here. It's always a pleasure"}
