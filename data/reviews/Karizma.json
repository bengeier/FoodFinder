{"text":"Being that this is a new restaurant, I have to say, they've done a great job in promoting the place. I happen to be in the area a few days ago and I decided to check it out. It's conveniently located on the N/E corner of Flamingo and Decatur.   As soon as we stepped in the restaurant we were pleasantly greeted and sat by Stephanie; a lovely and friendly server.  She was an absolute pleasure to deal with, very attentive and with a great personality.    The atmosphere was classy and relaxed, I felt welcomed the second I stepped inside.  With it's dim lighting and retro design the place is perfect for a night out with friends and family.  It being a new restaurant,  I asked the server for a suggestion on what I should order. I thought, \"I'll let them show me what this place is all about\". I am glad I did. The food was absolutely stellar. I ordered the \"chef's special\" that night which was a spicy chicken and rice dish.  It was hands down one of the best meals I've had in a while. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. The chef is extremely talented, and her dish tasted like I should have paid more for my dinner. SO GOOD, If you're looking for great Mediterranean food and atmosphere, you cannot go wrong with this place.   Also, if you're looking for quality hookah in Las Vegas, there are only a hand full of places where you will find it, and if you do, the service is not the best. In my experience of visiting hookah lounges, you either get great hookah, or great service, never both. FINALLY, a place that you can expect both. loading a proper hookah has an art to it, and the hookah masters have nailed it. I had to leave for my appointment before my bowl was finally gone.   I cannot say enough good things about this new restaurant/hookah bar. I'm glad they are open for business, and if they continue with this model, passion and attention to the customer, we will all enjoy this place for a long time."}
{"text":"I had been eating at this place for years. Their kabobs were as good as I ever had. Apparently they got a new chef recently. Bad move! If I were them, I'd beg the last chef to come back. Won't be coming back, unfortunately. Sad day for me!"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. Great hookah and best service. The hookah guy and the bartender and the manager was to nice and amazing + finger licking food"}
{"text":"We are so disappointed!  We ordered for delivery and spent $15 and $16 on dinner. We have no issue paying for good food- this was not it.  What came was dry falafel plate with small slices of tomatoes, pickles and cucumber with one pita cut in half.  The tahini sauce was barely a tablespoon.  The gyro plate came with paper thin slices of meat, a 1/2 cup of salad, one pita and another tablespoon of sauce. We do not mind spending money on food, but this was ridiculous.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The Chef! She hands down can cook and her food never disappoints.  Been there twice with friend and always leave raving about the place.   Stephanie the waitress, amazing customer service and such a wonderful character.  The environment is very comfortable, nice layout and just a good feel.  I can not say enough about how good the food is, so good I came back the next weekend!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but I didn't get a chance. I went on a Thursday night, and there were only two other tables occupied by hookah smokers. Our order was taken, and 40 minutes later, we still had no food. No explanation, zero customer service, and no food. When we got so hungry we decided to leave, the staff watched us leave without a word."}
{"text":"I'm in a conundrum, every time we find a new intimate place and write about it the next time we go we need reservations, but here goes.  Chris, the early shift mixologist has a very special touch with his liquors, and he listened to my wife and blended a cocktail to her description of flavor and hit it perfectly,  CJ, our server was very cheerful, helpful, and honest.  A breath of fresh air and presented our drinks, appetizer, and order with grace and class, even tending to our left overs.  Jeanine was a major surprise.  She is the chef at the restaurant, and came out and talked to us personally about questions we had about dishes, gave us sound recommendations, and prepared absolutely marvelous Preserved Lemon Chicken Tangine an Beef Schwarma plate with salad.  Jeanine visited us twice personally during the meal, and as a final pass try her homade Baklava for desert.  I see return visits in our futureI"}
{"text":"As lovers of hookah, our experience was beyond horrible. When we first got to the place, we ordered one of the fresh fruit bowls. The bowl was too harsh and the person who was serving us was kind enough to offer to change it for us. A woman who seemed to be the manager started yelling at him in front of us - asking things like \"why did they have two bowls and we're not charging them for it?\". She was constantly pointing at us and making us feel really uncomfortable. We went and talked to her and explained to her that he was only trying to help. Afterwards, the same woman asked us to change our seats as she \"reserved\" them for someone else. We said OK, and we moved outside, which was freezing, as there were zero open seats inside. After being outside for less than an hour, the same woman comes back and says \"sorry you've been smoking for too long and we need to use the hookah you're using for someone else - we have a policy that you could only smoke for 45 minutes only\".  I have have been to so many hookah places and I have NEVER experienced such horrible service. The woman who's the manager obviously has zero experience in the service industry. I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the absolute worst hookah lounges I have ever had the misfortune of visiting. First off when we got our hookah it was obvious that the bowl was packed way too tight, so it made for a really hard draw. Second of all, they put five coals on it so it was not only a hard pull, but also tasted very harsh. When we asked to take a few coals off because it was too harsh. They took one off, which didn't really do anything to help the situation. Also the flavors we picked were completely masked by whatever flavor the person before us had smoked. Did I mention that they clearly don't wash their hookahs or even change the water???Yeah, the water in our base was a very dark BROWN color when we got it. That's BEFORE we even started smoking. The inside and outside of the place is amazing, but what they serve you inside is something God awful. The staff was really friendly and nice, but it's obvious that no one has taught them how to make even a half decent bowl. The hookah here will make you feel noxious and sick after 10 mins of smoking. Not exactly a relaxing experience. Stay away if you value your health. Definitely not coming back here again."}
{"text":"Wow. The food was incredibly bad. Got delivery from here and the gyro meat looked like spam, the falafel tasted like sawdust and the tabouleh was actually off (rancid). Imagine the worst bar food you've ever seen, then make it worse than that. We took a few bites of each dish, then threw it all out and ordered from a different restaurant. First time in my life I've ever done that. Pretty clear the rest of these 5 star reviews are fake and/or the owner's friends."}
{"text":"You have been there, the new hookah lounge down the street or the new Mediterranean restaurant just opening up in your neck of the woods, you go there full of expectations and hope only to be disappointed. So u can imagine my surprise walking into Karizma and being blown away. From the moment I stepped in I garnered the attention of the staff. The food was impeccable with a home made feel that's hard to duplicate. The hookahs are brand new with spot-on flavors that out lasted me as I enjoyed the mystical, Moroccan-style decor.  The pricing is on par with other hookah lounges. On my visit the place ran seamlessly under the attentive direction of the manager in charge, Zahra. I feel her grace, attention to detail and welcoming smile was contagious and helped set Karizma apart from others. Check it out and you maybe blown away too!"}
{"text":"I came in today for a colour, leave-in conditioning treatment, and a haircut. Andre did a good job and was a professional. He was upfront about colouring my mane and told me because I had so much hair (and I do), there would be an additional charge for every tube of colour used - and this I appreciated because then I wasn't blindsided by some astronomical price at the end of my visit, which is what a lot of other salons do unfortunately.  P.S.  Don't get confused at 5 Carlton when you see \"Hair in the City\" because Andre is located there.  EDITED 28/10/2015 - Alright so I downgraded my review to 2 stars from 4 because upon closer inspection, my colour job is INCONSISTENT and PATCHY. Some areas are vibrant, while other areas like the ends of my hair are my natural hair colour and you can't see any noticeable difference. Basically, near the roots is where the colour is most concentrated, and at the ends there is barely any colour which leads me to believe he was being rather stingy with the colour tubes... I would have happily paid for the extra one had he told me I needed more colour. I thought I was happy with the hair dye job, but I was wrong. The lighting in the salon mislead me. That being said, the customer service and attentiveness was great - but the actual results leave were sub-par and not satisfactory. Furthermore, someone at work actually went up to me and said, \"What's wrong with your hair?\" Yikes. Not coming here again, which is unfortunate because Andre is a really nice guy. He just did a really poor job on my hair."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in everything here. I won't leave a bad review based off the terrible decor and lackluster service because I've learned you can't expect those things at a middle eastern hookah lounge/restaurant so my review reflects only the low quality food and burnt hookah. If everything was really cheap I wouldn't be surprised with the quality but prices were definitely higher than expected. It's very obvious that they copy/pasted the concept/menu from a successful business that has been in town for a very long time and they definitely implemented it very poorly. They are the restaurant equivalent of a cheap knock off item, except it's the same price as a genuine one."}
{"text":"Andre is a fantastic hairdresser! My hair was in rough shape and was damaged from dying it a bunch of times :(   Luckily, he fixed it! He gave me a really good colour and gave it s good cut.   Overall, he is very friendly, open-minded and makes good suggestions. I have found some hairdressers too pushy or judge me too much for having died my hair at home. But he was really sweet to me the entire time and make really good suggestions. I recommend checking this guy out.    He's also a total sweetie-pie...but I don't know if this matters to other people."}
{"text":"Great place , hookah good flavor I smoke Mint starbazz also I enjoyed with my friend with singer and they make a good takka kabab"}
{"text":"So, the service was terrible. The haircut and color was terrible. Everything sucked. I posted a photo previously of Andre's rude response to my review.  From the moment I walked in to the moment I left, Andre would not stop talking/moaning/whining about how difficult and apparently \"dreaded\" my hair was. Firstly, my hair is thick, curly and dense. You're going to find tangles...I don't wash my hair every other day like most people. Sure, I have tangles/dreads in my hair. If I can get them out myself, so can he. Instead, he made me detangle my own hair, which took an entire 45 seconds.The entire experience was filled with huffing, puffing and making side comments about how thick and tangled my hair was. OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BRUSH MY HAIR OUT IN 5 SECONDS. He responded saying I was trying to pull the race card..but no..I was pulling the \"you don't know how to work on any other hair but straight-card\". The guy is so unprofessional and clearly has not ventured out with different hair textures. Can't believe I wasted money on his crappy job and if you're someone who isn't white with thin, frail, short hair then don't even bother going there. His work sucked and his attitude sucked even more."}
{"text":"Hookah is the worst I've ever had. I'm sorry but the staff and the manager there need to learn how to treat customers right. We told them that we were visiting and was our last night in NYC, so we asked to seat in a nice area and they refused saying that it was for groups while the place was literally empty."}
{"text":"Solid hookah bar all around. Not very crowded on a Saturday night and only $15 for a 3 flavor hookah with $10 refills. Food costs about $15 for a full plate but was very large. The hookah wasn't the strongest and the food wasn't former but the full ensemble was very good overall. Nice staff and nice  venue for a nice Saturday night out."}
{"text":"I've came in a few times and feel lucky every time, because you just can't go wrong.  From the salads to kabobs it's always great!  My fav dish here are the chicken kabobs and chef Jainine serves it up great each time.  Last time I even tried the desert and that is a special treat, great date night for my hubby and me :)   Thanks for the wonderful food & ambience."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this amazing new place opened. Hands down the best Mediterranean food you're going to find in town with incredible prices and tasty drinks. Definitely a great vibe to bring friends and family to enjoy a great night."}
{"text":"First off, FOOD...AH-MAZE-ING. I don't remember the dishes we had, but we had almost everything on the menu and it was nothing short of delicious, Mediterranean madness. I'm not a hookah smoker, but according to my friends, the flavors were awesome too. Make sure to go visit Nelly at the bar at night! I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Wow! 4 waxy, limp, pale french fries were thrown haphazardly on a pile of gravied rice and cut up pieces of of chicken. It was presented in such an unappealing manner, the food became hard to enjoy. There was no care or pride of workmanship in the presentation of the food. What could have been a great experience was greatly diminished. The food was frugally given but what we had tasted fine. I have had better for much less expense."}
{"text":"I'm a hookah lover , i smoke hookah all the time, and I've tried different places and let me tell ya! This hookah lounge is amazing !! The hookah guy is the best, just ask him to make you something and guess what! You will get the best hookah you ever had! And the manager is such a sweetheart! Top of what you are getting she always gives us the best and fresh baklava and the great moroccan tea! Great and lovely place! Best selection of music! Im just in love with this place . They have the greatest and delicious food ever!!!"}
{"text":"I have to say the service is just amazing. I love this place.  Zara and Sepehr in particular were just over the top  phenomenal in welcoming me.. The food is just great.  I had the chicken & beef (koobideh) kabobs which were just perfect.  Sepehr is really on top of the hookah and does great fruit top hookah (pineapple top is what I got)  and special tobacco flavour mixes.  Ask him for the 7 fruit mix flavour in particular.  I call it the Sepehr as it is not really on the menu. Zara goes out of her way to make sure your experience is memorable. This place is lucky to have the two of them.  Update.  Zara and Sepehr are no longer there and the reason I was told is the owner didn't pay them.  Not cool.  They were the only reason I went there as they created a great atmosphere.  Changed my rating accordingly."}
{"text":"Amazing Food, Amazing Ambience and Amazing Atmosphere, Zara & Mohammad made us very comfortable, I recommend all who is in for fun food & good time !!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is perfect, comfortable, and fun!  The staff was so kind & attentive!! Everything we tasted is just spectacular, & we tasted quite a bit!!  The belly dancer did such a nice job! My kids had a fantastic amazing time, & I  would definitely come back, & recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would!!! Their menu is terrible, I ordered four items and they told me two of my four items they \"don't have\" so I asked for a couple of other things on their menu, they told me they don't that either. So irritating and unprofessional"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times & I honestly LOVE this place! Nelly is a wonderful bartender, Zara was super sweet, and whoever packs the shisha is amazing! Food, drinks, & hookah are just simply great! The music, ambiance, & service is one of the best! So glad I found a place that's very inexpensive compared to a lot of these other hookah lounges. See for yourself! This place is definitely worth coming to whether you're a local or visitor, they make you feel super welcomed. Hands down my new favorite hangout spot"}
{"text":"My first time in here and I love this place. Great music, hookah, food, and staff. And the atmosphere is very nice. Cozy couches too!!!"}
{"text":"First time here atmosphere was great appetizers delicious entrées very yummy the chef came out and greeted us the waitress KELLY did a great job with recommended hookah next time"}
