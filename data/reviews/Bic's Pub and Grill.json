{"text":"We tried this place the other night when we wanted someplace close. Glad we chose here. The wet pub burrito was delicious ad was  my husband's walleye plate and daughter's Mexican nachos.  The waitress was attentive and the atmosphere was sporty.  Great specials during the week.  We will definitely support this local pub again."}
{"text":"Their mac and cheese is divine! I ordered the crab mac and cheese. We also ordered the taco fries for an appetizer and was a little disappointed as to what they were. We were expecting taco seasoning and cheese, but they came with beef and a cheese sauce. They have a lot of beers/drinks to choose from. The waitress was very nice and welcoming. The building is very clean looking. Definitely a neighborhood hangout spot. I will be back for more mac!"}
{"text":"This is a great place We had the chicken penna Ala volka and that was the best I ever had"}
{"text":"Fantastic local place. Burgers are excellent. Mac N Cheese is bomb. Buffalo chicken wrap is fantastic. Beer selection is basic, as is the 6-pack shop. Very casual atmosphere. Nice small place for meeting up with friends. When the weather is nice they have picnic tables set up outside and they will occasionally have outdoor grilling. Staff is friendly, usually the same waitress."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few times and have yet to not like anything we ordered. Chicken wrap and Pubber Wet Burrito are our faves. They have really revamped the place since the last owners and made it a pretty cool pub/restaurant. There was only one parking spot when we got here tonight, that says a lot too. Highly recommend giving Bic's a try!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here earlier this week for a lunch meeting with a sales rep and my two bosses. We are in the Harrison City area and, anyone who is familiar with this area will know, there's not many places to dine. I had never been in here before, but had heard good things about the place. It was 12:30 when we stopped in and we were the only ones there, except for the older gentleman behind the bar. He quickly waited on us, giving us menus and taking our drink orders. Since it was a work thing, I stayed away from alcoholic beverages. Biggest con about this place? No iced tea. That's like my go-to drink. I drink about 6 bottles of water a day, so I always get iced tea when I go out to eat. Anyway, I decided to get a Diet Coke. Man, but I really wanted an iced tea. Regardless. we take a look at the menu and all decide on something different.   The menu is fairly simple bar food - pizza, wraps, burgers and sandwiches, salads, apps, wings, etc. The one exception is the Mighty Mac& Cheese, which we decided to get an order of and share. They have House Mac, which is what we got, but they also have 4 Cheese, Philly Cheese Steak, Buffalo Chicken, Crab Crusted, and Mushroom Mac. They also have a \"build your own mac night\" on Tuesdays. Not sure what that all entails, but it sounds awesome nonetheless.  I ordered the steak wrap with fries. The wrap was shaved steak, with onions, peppers, mushrooms, and cheese in a grilled tortilla. It came with a side of Au Jus....but I passed and went with a side of ranch for my wrap and fries instead. So, the steak wrap was very good, but a little on the small side. The fries were also fine, but way too much salt for my taste. The rest of my group had a burger and fries (burger was huge!), philly cheese steak and fries, and a ranch chicken wrap with chips. Everyone enjoyed their meals. However, the House Mac that we shared was the shining star. It came in a baking dish and had large spiral noodles. The top was crunchy and the rest was delicious - with warm melted cheese...and it was not very heavy on the cheese.   While we were eating, a couple came in and then when we were almost finished, two younger girls came in and sat down. The older gentleman was the only one working, and he was cooking, waiting on the tables, doing it all really. Overall, this is a cute little place with a sports theme. And it is rather on the small side, but that's fine with me. Only about eight hightop tables, 2 or 3 regular tables, and a small bar. Based on my meal alone, I would have given Bic's 3 stars. But because of the mac n cheese, everyone else enjoying their meals, and our waiter / cook, 4 stars it is! I would definitely come back, especially to watch a game and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food!  Everything I have tried here tastes amazing!  Best pizza around too! And you have to try their pub burrito, full of flavor and tastes authentic!"}
