{"text":"I've been going to the Top Brass for years. It's our stop before and after ball, considering the park is only a few blocks away. Hell, there were even a few durings ... well, at least when there were rainouts anyway.

The beer is cold and Char is one of the best servers in the city. You go there enough and she'll call you by name, bringing you the right beer without you even asking.

I can't improve upon Spencer's description of one of my favourite seedy pubs in Calgary. But I can let you know you'll find the best ginger beef at the Brass. 

And dumplings. I almost forgot the dumplings. Our usual is ginger beef, dumplings and chow mein. 

Between two people, there's enough for leftovers the next day. Or when you get home.

Yum!

Oh yeah, wing night is Monday and Wednesday ... Caesars on sale on Thursdays.

The hangover special? Go for breakie ... I think it's about three or four bucks for Texas toast, hash browns, two eggs and you choice of ham, sausage or bacon."}
{"text":"I dont kmnow if there is anything special about this place . Very boring but overall average. Would like a little more service and not so much flagging the bar tender for another round.
Snoozeville but hey its a bar. Some one in the staff was very loud and should be talked to so not to scare any of the girls away. The girl I was with asked to leave so we did."}
{"text":"I spent $68 on Chinese food. A combo dinner with 2 choices plus extras. It seemed like more than enough for a family of 4. What arrived was cold, missing items and and a complete ripoff. I'm livid."}
{"text":"Friendly, efficient service. Good food. Most for is prepared in house, not purchased prepacked hear and serve."}
{"text":"Your standard Calgary watering hole.
Big with lots of space, nice long bar and a couple of pool tables.
I actually stopped for breakfast one Saturday morning and it was great and cheap!
Staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Drive by this pub for years and finally made the plunge yesterday. 

Service very good and menu is huge. Lots of items you expect from a pub from steak sandwich to burgers. 

On another note there is a decent westernize size of Chinese food from standard chicken fried rice to sweet and sour pork to wor wonton. 

Food portions are big and pricing is decent. 

Ambience is local pub feel and the chairs and decor are dated but makes the place feel homely. 

Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Top Brass combines a bunch of things I usually find off-putting, (VLTs, classic rock radio, no micro-brews), but they manage to pull it off.

Driving by Top Brass you'd probably think it was a dive bar, it is after all located in the corner of an all automotive service mall, but it's more reminiscent of a Western/Chinese restaurant you find roadside in every small town across the prairies. 

The menu is an even split between burgers, club sandwiches and deep fried appetizers and spring rolls, chow mein, and chop suey.

We started with 2 curry spring rolls and they were great with no skimping on the curry, delivered with two packets of plum sauce for dipping.

Mains were curried shrimp and vegetables and black bean chicken with veggies as well. The sauces were forceful and had strong flavours, the meats were clean cut and the vegetables were fresh. All for $10.95 a plate.

Since it was Sunday, ceasers were on special and 2 of those came to $8 and my mug of Kokanee Gold was around $6.

All in all the 2 of us walked out stuffed for $39 before tip.

A word on the decor of Top Brass: when you enter you'll immediately see the pool tables and dart boards, followed by the VLTs on one wall, with the tables and booths across the way. Seat yourself under one of the many neon signs and you are good to go,

I imagine the place is packed at lunch but for an 8pm Sunday dinner, the service was a little slow, but not a huge deal since we were in no rush.

If you want to re-create the feel of being on a road-trip at home, Top Brass will do the trick. Not to mention being a great locale for a cheap lunch or dinner if you're running errands in the NE."}
