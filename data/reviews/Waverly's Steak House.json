{"text":"Bad service, bad food...too bad...was hopeful. To explain: Waiter didn't care, server didn't say a word, manager wasn't pleasant, all disappeared when we asked for assistance. Food was just awful. Salad was over dressed with no flavor cream dressing, the medium well steak was pastey, tasted like bad liver...etc. Talked with the food and beverage manager...he was pleasant and listened attentively. He said he would talk with staff at the restaurant and offered us a comp upon our future visit to the restaurant. No thanks! We do like the Cannery, and Victory's coffee shop isn't bad...but Waverley's is a no go!!!"}
{"text":"Everything at Waverly's is so delicious. Never a disappointment!

The service level of the entire staff is non-comparable to any high end restaurant.
The food is amazing Chef Andres is the best.

Todd Land is the manager goes above and beyond not only for his customers but he is a great manager to his staff! (That goes a long way with me!)

The value at Waverly's is never a question. You get what you pay for and here it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. We waited for over 15 minutes to be even noticed where we were seated. We had to ask who our server was....he finally came to ask our order...then long after the salad was eaten....he said our entry would be coming... we finally got our entree and the potatoes were still crunchy and raw. When we told our server that the potatoes were not cooked he told us that the shift likes them aldente. Instead of offering to have them cooked more or something else replaced he offered nothing. Very disappointing the chicken was tasty and the Bread Basket always good the salad was good too"}
{"text":"Waverly's Steak House is very unassuming from the casino. It has a single double door at the casino and it looks like it would be small & lowbrow. Waverly's is nothing of the sort. When you walk in you can see it stretch to the side and back. There are trees on the outside that mask the size from the outside. The decor is very upscale. If you come in in jeans they treat you as well as if you came in in your tux and fine dress. Waverly's is a fine upscale restaurant.

Visit the link below to get a look at the menu. I decided to go with the Rib Eye on this visit. I started it off with a Caesar Salad which was delicious. I was surprised by it's size. Much larger than I would have thought. There was just the right amount of dressing & cheese, and the croutons were crunchy and had a lot of flavor to them. My steak was prepared just as I had ordered it. Medium rare all the way through. That taste was wonderful. Some times I have ordered steak and had to add some salt to give it some flavor. That was not the case with this Rib Eye. It was tender, juicy, and full of flavor the way a good steak should be.

I choose a Potatoes Au Gratin as my side dish. The potatoes were about an eight of an inch cubed. I am not used to potatoes being served that way. Especially an Au Gratin. I tell you though, this was one of the best Potatoes Au Gratin I have ever tasted. The cheese in the potatoes let you know it was there, but did not mask the taste of the perfectly cooked potato. The seasonings were just right. I did not have to add any extra seasonings. I do have to say, if the order were doubled, it still would not have been enough. And the order that came was not small.

My wife had the lamb and a side of mashed potatoes. My steak was so much I did not taste the lamb. I had a few bites of the mashed potatoes though. The potatoes were so fluffy and light. Whenever I have had potatoes that fluffy in the past, they were also watery. These were not like that at all. They were so light, fluffy and tasty they seemed as if they could just float away. My wife tells me me lamb was very tasty and cooked to a perfect medium rare. This evening my wife and I choose just to have water to drink. So, no info about the wines they have. Sorry.

The service was pretty good. It started off excellent, but at some point they might have gotten overwhelmed. There was a period of over ten minutes that no one came by our table to give me a refill on my water. I had to stop eating my steak while I waited. I needed a drink. A bus person finally walked by the table and I flagged him down. He did promptly get me a refill on my water. He was also very apologetic. That is what has saved them from a very low service score. I do have to add, that a lot of people came in at that time and all the servers were very busy seating and arranging tables. Maybe that is what happened this time. When I got back to my steak, luckily it was still warm and wonderful."}
{"text":"Wow, has this place gone downhill. From lower quality Beef, to smaller servings, to indifferent management and the list goes on. At one time this was one of my favorite places in North Las Vegas - Now I will spend my gaming dollars elsewhere. Steaks are Choice (at best) not prime. The other items are just not worth having at all. The manager was willing to make zero accommodations on any changes. Skip this entire Casino as it's in transition to a Low End Facility by Boyd Gaming. Be prepared to spend $ 100.00 per patron, a price totally out of line for what they delusionally think they are. The Atmosphere is also in need of a total overhaul - since the Dining Room is neither Classy or updated. Just an Oldie looking tired."}
{"text":"I love my Waverly's as usual Daryl has served perfection with service and entree's that are amazing, would've been 5 stars if the overbearing New manager wouldn't have tried to throw her weight around at the hostess podium and belittle the hostesses work."}
{"text":"My favorite steak house!!  Where do I start?  We have eaten at Waverlys many times so it is time to write a review. First - we have never had a bad meal.  The steaks are done perfectly, the mashed potatoes are the best, and the bread basket offerings are wonderful. Second - the atmosphere is perfect.  It is intimate and cozy with the added bonus of piano background music. Third - people like Todd (manager) and Frederick (server), make you feel important and wanted.  Frederick is attentive to your every need and Todd moves around the restaurant greeting his customers which makes all customers feel so welcomed.  I can't tell you the best attribute of Waverlys because the food, atmosphere and people make this a perfect dining experience.  I love you Waverlys!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Waverleys on Saturday night to celebrate my wife's birthday and our friend's anniversary. Our waiter \"Nills\" was awesome and the food was even better! The escargot appetizer and portebello fritta were to die for and the main course was great as well. Will be back to Waverleys during our next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"I had brunch here last Sunday and I would have to say that the Rib-eye steak was awesome. A perfectly cooked medium rare with soup ,appetizer platter and dessert buffet  for around $24 is a pretty awesome deal for me. The service was very good. The meat is most likely not \"PRIME\" cut but for the price it was delicious. This experience this time around was way better. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Omg where to start Darrel! Is the best server ever he make sure you need nothing for the best dining experience. Friendly and very professional outstanding customer service is better than Top5! I go at least 2-3 times a month don't miss out ask for Darrel! Everyone is great but he is a shining STAR.. THANKS ALL SEE YOU SOON. Jennifer Jennifer Jennifer at the bar is the best go get your sidecar or any other amazing Because of them this place is better"}
{"text":"Ambience: Would not expect something this nice at Cannery Hotel but it is the nicest looking restaurant there. More for couples than group gatherings.

Service: The ambience & food make up for this, which unfortunately for us, the service has been terrible. We have come fairly close to restaurant closing both times (within the hour), but they do close very early for Vegas. The staff makes it VERY clear that they want to go home right from the start in hurrying orders and are more aggressive as time goes on. Unfortunate.

Food: Very good. A little salty on some items during our first visit but good overall and again, warrants the overall 3 stars. Steak. Scallops wrapped in bacon. Calamari. Cobb salad. etc."}
{"text":"For the Cannery Casino...A plus! The staff in the restaurant is good The food is good! Nice to go there when they run specials, or expect a pricier menu...Not sure why the entire casino can't be run the way Waverley's is..."}
{"text":"My expectations weren't very high when I tried this place what with it being in The Cannery (a casino way off the strip), but to say I was surprised is a huge understatement!  The decor and presentation were on par with Flemmings Steakhouse without the cost being so insane that it's all you can think about while you're eating.  The waiter and manager were both very attentive without being intrusive but the main thing was the ribeye and cheddar bacon potatoes were awesome! I had a piece of the Mississippi Mud Pie for desert which was also worth a repeat. If I had to find any fault I'd say the coffee could have been a touch stronger.   I'll definitely make sure to stop in again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The only thing I can rave about here is the portabello fries- they're incredible. Thick slices of mushroom, lightly battered, and served with a great creamy dipping sauce. Definitely start your meal off with an order.

But everything else had issues, including the service.
Lobster bisque was delicate to the point of bland, and tasted more of clams than lobster. Wedge salad was fine, bleu cheese crumbles were so small that it was hard to eat on the salad and most was left behind on the plate. Lamb chops were cooked perfectly to medium-rare, as ordered, and nicely seasoned, but were very fatty, with a thick rind of gristle on each piece. 

Service was polite, but I don't like how I was charged to purchase a side when I subbed a vegetable for the included potato. Server said there'd be a small fee, which I'm fine with- instead, I was rung up for a full side order and simply didn't receive one with my meal. If you can't do substitutions, just say so. I guess they're trying to pad the bill since there were only four tables on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Best prime rib I've had in awhile! Jennifer the bartender makes an exceptional dirty martini. Great service and food!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and exceptional, friendly service.  Never disappointed with the food or the service."}
{"text":"My husband and  I recently went to Waverly's as we so often have done in the past.
I ordered their 10 oz Sirloin Special expecting to get the same quality of meat and thickness that I had received in the past.  When i received my steak this time, it looked like a very \"thinly\" cut piece of breakfast steak.  I have eaten better looking steaks at a cheap buffet.  It looked as if they were running out of the special so they had to compensate with a cheaper cut.  If I would have known this to begin with I would have ordered something else.  I happen to like sirloins and believe me, you can get a much better steak from OUTBACK.

When I brought this to the attention of the waiter and manager, they offhandedly said that I had received an end cut.  I I had a center cut of the sirloin like I did before, it would have been a thicker cut of meat.  Where is the quality control here?  One day you get a center cut and the next time you might get a breakfast steak????????????
For a self-proclaimed upscale restaurant, this should be inexcusable.  I was not offered an apology or compensated for an inferior and smaller cut of meat.  Needless to say, there are a hundred different steak restaurants in town and I will not be returning to Waverly's."}
{"text":"We went because yelp friends said the food was excellent and it was amazing.  Frederick was our server as my friends had enjoyed him before and
 highly recommended him.  What a great waiter! If was as good as any steakhouse I have gone  to ever! 

Bob Millard who is one of the best piano players in the country was there playing. What a treat to dee this legend up close + personal.  What a nice guy. He played with Tom Jones, Dudley Moore, Phyllis Diller and Dustin Hoffman to name a few.  He is as good  today as ever!

Go and enjoy their 3 course meal and listen to Mr. Millard tickle the Ivories. You will have s great night.  Friday + Saturdays ."}
{"text":"We are driving from AZ up to Portland and decided to stay for our first night in a Best Western Plus in N Las Vegas, since we aren't gamblers.  Found the Cannery casino and figured they would have a nice steakhouse.  We weren't disappointed!
Our waiter Darryl was wonderful!  We heard the specials and after I asked about it, he directed me to their steaks.  Yay! I had a Ribeye done perfectly.  My husband had Prime Rib.  Yum - we'll have steak bites for our next day's drive north.  Escargots were in mushrooms but very good as an app.
Mississippi Mud pie was ok, similar to  Baskin Robbin's Jamaica Almond Fudge.
Overall, a fine dining establishment, but the clientele is tacky...don't bother dressing up for this place!"}
{"text":"Waverley's is a reasonably priced steak house in the Northside Cannery. The atmosphere is nice, service was friendly, and the food was very good. 

First, their bread basket is really yummy, with a nice variety of warm breads served with whipped butter.  Onion soup was excellent with a rich broth and plenty of luscious melted cheese on top. My Filet and Lobster entree was wonderful and cooked perfectly. My date's prime rib (end cut) was also outstanding.

For sides, we really enjoyed their creamed corn and sauteed mushrooms. The only thing I didn't love was the sauvignon potatoes, which were slightly undercooked.

While not THE most amazing dining experience, it was a solid meal and a pleasant experience, and I would happily return."}
{"text":"I heard about Waverly on Yelp and decided to give it a try as it is close to my neighborhood. unfortunately I was very disappointed. The service was fine but nothing over the top as some of the recent steakhouses I have been to this month. I was most disappointed with the RibEye steak that I ordered and the scalloped potatoes. The potatoes were too dry and had no flavor or salt whatsoever. The worst was the steak I ordered medium but the cut was worse than I could have got at a local grocery. The steak also had no seasoning and was just so blah...I ordered a Cosmo and that was good. I must say on my venture to go to all the Las Vegas restaurants that this by far the worst steak I have tasted."}
{"text":"The prime rib had no salt crust. Almost no flavor. The service was nice, but awkward. My vodka gimlet was far too much rose's lime, but it was serviceable. Crème brûlée was good."}
{"text":"Filet Mignon, 8 oz. $33 ... very tender, great flavor, I ordered medium. Should have ordered medium rare. Medium arrived charred and crispy on the edges, but still perfect inside. Side garlic mashed potatoes ... perfect! 

Add-ons: Scallops $15 (3)... perfectly tender and large. Floating on unknown sauces. A little pricey in my opinion, but very tasty. Sauteed Mushrooms $5 ... worth the order. 

Side salad #1: Waverly's strawberry spinach salad $6 ... fresh strawberries, spiced pecans, fresh mushrooms, red onions with a poppy seed dressing. Clearly their specialty. This salad was perfect!
Side salad #2: wedge $6 ... not worth ordering. Watery raspberry \"house\" vinaigrette on plain iceberg lettuce with blue cheese crumbles, seedless cucumbers, Roma tomatoes, and red onions. Intent was good, but execution failed.

Try this: complimentary white chocolate walnut bread. Sweet, warm, tasty.

Somebody else commented about the out of place veggie and fruit murals. I had to post a picture. Just strange and odd. Very nice restaurant. I would get the filet and scallops again and not the wedge salad."}
{"text":"Been here three or four times and we have always had great food and service.  Recently we had Fredrick and Jonathan attending to us and both are friendly and all over their duties.  The steak and salads have always been great, bread and lavish are great also.  I didn't want mashed potatoes with my steak so they gave me some grilled veggies that were awesome.  The only negative thing I would say is that their asparagus isn't that great.  They are large and come with a sauce that I don't care for.  I think it'd be better with a garlic sauce and cooked a bit more.  Just my preference."}
{"text":"So The S family was in Vegas this weekend for a wedding, and I put in a call to my Las Vegas liaison, who recommended Waverly's for nice dining in NoLaVe (um, North Las Vegas, c'mon!).  
Tucked in the dimly-lit corner of the new-but-second-rate casino The Cannery, Waverly's serves up juicy steaks and other meats juicy, flavorful, and hot as hell just like they deserve.  The staff were so attentive that they were almost constantly apologetic.  This came in handy when due to a large party, our dinner was delayed at least 15 minutes.  Luckily we had the two dark, moist artisan breads toasted to perfection and doused with butter to whet our collective whistle while whaiting a WHile.  I had halibut-the best halibut I've ever tasted, and nibbled on the S's veal (tender and covered in yum) and prime rib (almost quiveringly rare but delish).  
Good wine list, tasty side dishes, and good atmosphere compliment the mighty meats.  Prices are appropriately high.  
Check it out if you need steak and you're in NoLaVe."}
{"text":"Would I consider this a top tier steakhouse? No. Everything that came with the meal was fantastic, except for the steak. Specifically, the steak was the poorly prepared, poorly cut, overly tough item. I overheard another table complaining about only their steak as well. I thought that \"stuff happens\" or \"don't be overly critical\", but then mine was bad as well. Again, everything else in the meal was fantastic, but they specialize as a Steak House. The waiter even told the other table \"Well, I don't grow the cows. Some are more stubborn than others.\"

Probably will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"As another Yelper said, don't be alarmed that this establishment is in a casino, it is worth the trip there. The service from Fredrick was exceptional, all we're on point! Food was fabulous, we were a party of four and everyone was very pleased with their meals. We will be back, the only downfall of the evening was wading through the sea of smoke to and from the restaurant, but Waverlys itself is smile free."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed when I go to Waverly's. The food is delicious and I love the fact that I don't have to go on the strip to get it! The customer service is A+ and then some. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you looking for a place that has an upscale flare without breaking the bank and without having to travel to far."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently discovered this gem of a restaurant! We love the attention to details....everything from their bread basket to their side dishes is amazing! For mid-range steakhouses, this is the best!! The waiters are efficient, really friendly and really knowledgeable about the menu! We love it here! Highly recommend the portabello appetizer, French onion soup & the strawberry salad!"}
{"text":"The waiters are amazing and very attentive to their customers needs. We never felt like they forgot about us and didn't have to ask for refills. The food was amazing! The lighting is perfect and the seating? Oh my goodness.. Amazing! Overall I loved my time there. It was my fiancées first time and we'll definitely return. Thank you Waverly's!!!"}
{"text":"Waverly's is a fabulous place for an evening out.  The ambiance is cozy with a talented live pianist .  North Las Vegas has very few nice restaurants with the kind of atmosphere and attentive staff that Waverley's offer.   As it is close to our house, we find Waverly's to be our \"go to\" place for fine dining.  Darrell has been our waiter often and is outstanding and very professional.  This is a place you can go and have a relaxing and enjoyable meal.  I have nothing but praise for Waverly's. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I have used Yelp and Open Table for years. This time I found a fabulous little gem right close to home. The Cannery has Waverly's Steak House. The atmosphere is fabulous. The service impeccable Frederick was attentive, fruendly and had an A+ sense of humor. 
Food range was 30+. But let tell you they have a little gem on the menu. It has a meal deal of all things. For $30 you can get soup or salad. Steak and Shrimp, with potatoes and asparagus , and a chocolate lovers dream.  Amazingly tender New York steak however it may change as it is a Chefs Choice. Try it you will not be disappointed if you do. Blessings all."}

{"text":"The service was good but the food was not worth the money. The ribeye had NO marbeling. It was flavorless. I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to dine.  First, the service is excellent.  Frederick is my waiter of choice and he is personable and exceptional in service.  Darryl is also an excellent waiter here.  The food is excellent especially the filet mignon.  There used to be a piano player (Bob Millard) and how I miss him.  Please bring him back!  He added just the right ambiance to the steakhouse."}

{"text":"Hub and I went here for dinner because we had bid on an auction that included a gift certificate to Waverlys.
We entered promptly at 5 PM for we had a show later at the Southpoint.
Hub and I ordered a bottle of Moët to start.  Our server Derrick was spectacular and brought the bottle over to start us off.
They also delivered a bread basket that had the best lavosh I think I have had in Vegas.
We did not order apps, for we do not normally eat large portions so we went straight to the main course and both ordered 8oz Filets, mine medium rare and hub straight medium.
The steaks arrived and they were Excellent!  Perfectly cooked and just full of flavor.....how in the world do they get that great flavor?
We both had mashed potatoes that were not saturated with butter.  You could actually taste the potato....and they were delicious!
Manager Todd came by and asked about our meal.   I immediately let him know how pleased we were.   I think it is particularly nice when a manager does this, but you can tell he really has his heart in it when he speaks with customers!
We finished off with a small taste of Port that finished an absolutely wonderful meal.
This place is GREAT.....find a way to get here.....just a beautiful experience with beautiful food!"}
{"text":"Had the she crab soup and the 8 Oz. fillet mingnon medium rare with the cheddar bacon potato. Steaks were cooked perfectly and the potato were very good. The truffle sauce that came with the steak was excellent.  This was my first visit and will defenatly come back."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 2 stars. the food is good ,overall dining experience was good, but this review is for the price...seriously we had the beef Wellington dinner that had potatoes and carrots on the side..$40 the meal itself, I wouldn't have paid no more than $25 and that's still a lot. The pastry was way bigger then the meat and burned on the bottom, the salads are separate we paid 200$ for 4 of us and I honestly could of eaten at a strip big name 5 star that was a 4 coarse meal for that price, I mean I guess If you have the money and you don't even care because the economy is beneath you than be my guest, but if I'm gonna pay for a meal like that I wanna say I spent my money well. Food is good but NOT WORTH THE PRICE THEY ASK FOR ,you could eat at Texas Road House/ Outback same kind of meal for cheaper....that's the truth!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very inexpensive for the quality.  I had a ribeye with an au poivre sauce with several side dishes.  The creamed corn and bacon scalloped potatoes were tasty.  I took two pieces of cheesecake and a chocolate cake home.  The desserts looked and tasted like they were bought frozen.  Everything but the desserts were very good.  I will definitely go back for the food"}
{"text":"We went to this steakhouse not sure what to expect, but WOW!! My husband and I each had a $25 off coupon from playing slots so we figured at worst it would be a mediocre meal for a reasonable price, but I am happy to say this place exceeded my expectations.

Service was exceptional and prompt. We made a lot of different requests and they were able to accommodate almost everything. All of the food was good, even the bread basket, but here's a breakdown of what we ordered:

Veal Oscar Roll - Very tasty, and pretty unique too. Served kinda like sushi (although it tastes nothing like it). They also sell this as a larger entrée but if you want to just try it out without spending too money, this is a great. It only came in 4 bites though, so it was gone pretty fast. Definitely not something to \"share\" with the table.

Portabello Frites - Husband LOVES portabello mushrooms, so he was a big fan of these. I'm just so-so on mushrooms, so I was just so-so on these. They are VERY mushroomy. If you love that then go for it. If not, you can pass on this.

Chopped Salad - Decent size and in a rather large bowl. It got the job done as far as a salad was concerned, and they were very accommodating when I wanted to switch out ingredients.

She-Crab Soup - For the price, this  was a little disappointing. We were hoping it would be a little meatier, but it's really just more of a crab bisque. We did ask for some Old Bay and while they didn't have that, they were able to bring out some sort of substitute that perked this soup up. I'd pass on this unless you're in the mood for a bisque.

Ribeye - VERY good. My husband likes his steak medium-rare and I like it medium. We asked if they could cut the steak in half and cook it differently and they were happy to do so - no plate sharing charge. Honestly we ordered so many appetizers we didn't really need two steaks at this point anyway. The steak tasted great and comes with a variety of sauces. If you can't decide (like me) they'll just bring you out all three. Mashed potatoes on the side were just all right, but I was pretty stuffed at this point anyway. 

Chocolate Decadence - It was my birthday so they brought me out a chocolate dessert. We were already pretty full but we can make a little room for chocolate cake. This was a hearty portion and it was a little too rich for me, but it was nice to finish it off with a sweet!  

Sadly there is no piano player anymore, at least not when I went. When I asked management about it, they said he still plays occasionally. 

Overall this was a fantastic steak restaurant for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Really great steak house. Wonderful staff that is on the ball. Ask for Darryl for your waiter - this gentlemen is a true professional and made our night very enjoyable. We had portobello fries as an appetizer and it came with an amazing sauce. The steaks were great along with a very good Wedge salad. I would highly recommend this spot for a great meal."}
{"text":"not only was the food amazing but the service as well. we ate on a slow night and the manager gave us free glasses of wine which was nice. he also offered to take a picture of me and my date. very clean restaurant, tablecloths are replaced after every meal."}
{"text":"We had reservations last night-New Years Eve to be specific. Every aspect of our experience was 5 star from the moment we walked in. The service was impeccable. I am a stickler for good service and everyone from our bus boys to our waiter was fantastic. I read the reviews before going to the restaurant and to my delight we had Frederick as our waiter. He received a lot of kudos from viewers and must say, when he introduced himself it made my day. Frederick was on top of everything. Our glasses were always full, finished dishes removed IMMEDIATELY and our dishes came out timely. He never missed a beat. Trust me, the food can be great, but when the service is not up to standards it can ruin the experience.

Now for the food. I started off with the escargot. It's not often I find this on menus nowadays and it being one of my favorite appetizers I was pleased to see it on the menu..The escargot was not prepared in the usual butter-garlic-wince sauce. Instead, they added their own twist and the sauce was delicious. It had enough sauce for me to moyo (dip in bread) which I enjoy. Next, I had the She-Clam soup. It was nothing I'd imagine it to be. In fact, it was even better. Not your typical soup you'd find on a menu. This soup was top of the line. I ordered it for myself and know next time to order this for my boyfriend as well as he kept dipping into my bowl. Not that I mind, but this is the sort of soup you want to enjoy for yourself. I was coveting this like a hawk. Finally, the ribeye steak. It was cooked perfect. I like my steak medium rare and arrived just as ordered. It was tender to the touch and in my mouth it melted like butter. The chef knows what he/she is doing. I topped the steak off with scallops. Talk about sexy. Yes, sexy. Coupled with the steak, the scallops was a nice sidekick.

Overall, I give Waverly Steakhouse a shaka from a Hawaiian gal who loves to eat and enjoys eating. I will definitely go back. I live on the North Side of Vegas and wanted to avoid the strip. Boy, am I glad we found this place. We're going to make it a regular stop.

For those who may not have had the same experience, my only suggestion is to try them again. 

Aloha,
Yvette"}
{"text":"We discovered this place off the strip and decided to stay at the Cannery Hotel & Casino since my father lives in Nellis AFB, only 10 min away.  This caliber restaurant is a hidden gem among this quaint, cigarette-filled casino.  Don't let it fool ya!  We had a very memorable, beautiful time!  The food is delicious, and the service IS impeccable!  The live piano music played in the background set the mood for a lovely evening. The pianist even charmed our 3 year old when she gave him a visit, and even played a couple of nursery tunes for her...Darling!  We enjoyed our 3-course Valentine's special...Wild Mushroom soup, your choice of halibut or steak, and chocolate lava cake with vanilla bean ice cream.  We also ordered extra appetizers -oysters, portobello frites, and escargot...aside from also filling up  on their delicious bread basket.  
We were comfortable, dressed \"crisp\" casual, and had the best dining experience!!  The food is absolutely delicious - filling! ..And we rolled ourselves right out of there.   See you again soon.  THANK YOU!"}

   .homemade  bread too.. ..also dessert of warm home made bread pudding with a  sauce  on it.  I am not a bread pudding fan but this was very good!

The decor is classic and nice and no smoking allowed...just make it through the casino and you will be fine.  This is our new go to steakhouse in town..nice ambiance and reasonable.. with wonderful old school service that won't break the bank!...really enjoyed ourselves.. give it a try.
5 stars for overall fine dining feel and experience at
a reasonable price"}
{"text":"A perfectly serviceable steakhouse; nothing to recommend it over other steakhouses (both food- and ambiance-wise)... but if you're in the area and want steak, this will do! Reasonably reasonable prices ($35 for petite filet, $20 for chicken) and bland-swanky decor...sort of like a Marie Callender's of steakhouses, for boring married couples or retirees on budgets who never go out to a steakhouse. If you rarely go out, you'll dig it...otherwise, it's pretty solidly Meh. In fact, I would have given it two stars...except it gets an extra star for its blessed un-pretentiousness (no stupid all-caps name, no deconstructed or fusion dishes, and no douchebaggy club music playing)."}
{"text":"Whenever possible I love to eat here. their steaks are tender and flavorful and their escargot is awesome. Great selection of liquor also."}
{"text":"Very accommodating i ask for pesto for my bread and the server said he will check with the chef server again ask me if i wanted it hot or cold i told him i wanted it hot...well warm.... couple of minutes later the server came back with my pesto and about a minute the chef came out and check if it was to my liking... GOOD JOB Chef and the whole crew keep up the good work!! I dont know their names but the time is 8:30pm 11/5/17 you know who you are!!"}
{"text":"Been going to this place for over ten years now, excellent service appetizers are Devine and creative, the escargot is absolutely wonderful, steaks are good , however not very prime tasting , but good enough"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with Diane C and as she stated everything was to notch. The steaks were very tender and cooked spot on. The sides were a la carte but very plentiful. I thoroughly enjoyed my Kobe beef burger with some of the house wine. If I were waiting in my last hour to go to the  chair I'd have another Kobe burger and a glass of wine then be clicking my heels along the green mile. Great place for a nice dinner date or a milestone and priced right."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while, but we used to eat here every other month. They have really good steaks that you can cut through with a butter knife.  Also if your a fan of sweet potatoes, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"This place is really nice inside it doesn't seem like your at the cannery. The crab cakes are good and I had the chicken and it was really good too. The best part was our waiter he was soooo nice and was very attentive. Great customer service here."}
{"text":"Not sure why I am posting this because I do not think they read their reviews.  The place is nice enough, service is spotty except for the busser, who should be a waiter, he is polished, polite, and very attentive. The food, some good, some not so much. Asked for the prime rib end cut. Dry and flavorless with a lot of gristle. Also when I asked for a baked potato instead of some cheese laden concoction, I was told that it would have an upcharge. Why? well as the waiter told me its a big potato from Idaho. Whatever. friend had the T-bone. Was cooked well and had good flavor. Side chopped salad and wedge salad were good. Would I spend 100 bucks for dinner there again?  Me thinks not."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Steak houses. The Food is always excellent service is to match. Great place for an elegant meal, hidden away in the Cannery Casino."}
{"text":"O. M. Gizz in my mouth. Hidden gem. And surprisingly affordable.  Nice classy place where u can wear casual clothes so that's a plus. Staff was amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing service! By both Frederick and Todd. And pretty much anyone that worked there. Food was unbelievable. Delicious and worth every penny.The parents and I decided we will definitely add it to our once a month dining experiences. :)
The dinner special is a bargain and includes dessert ($30). The lobster tail was on point and with the warm drawn butter - super amazing. Oh yes the white chocolate bread was unreal...yes I said white chocolate BREAD."}
{"text":"The room is tastefully decorated and service throughout our meal was excellent.  
We decided to pass on appetizers/salads in favor of an order of delicious sautéed spinach.  We each chose grilled halibut for an entree that came with au gratin potatoes.  Everything was excellent though our halibut was overdone and dry.  We did not return the fish because we were under tight time constraints since we would be seeing a show immediately following."}
{"text":"Absolutely great service, I recommend asking for Frederick if you go to the establishment it is very underrated and understandably so seeing as how it is in a Casino but it is well worth the trip and the food is amazing! I was very impressed by the service and personal and individual feeling I received when I went there overall fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous steak house. The food and service are excellent! Had a Fillet and it was cooked perfect as were the shrooms. Was a very nice end to my birthday.

I recommend Waverly's if you are north of the strip."}
{"text":"Daryl, Giovanni, Dorian, Eddie and Todd .. You guys are the best.  Superb service and food!"}
{"text":"Yelpers this was a disappointing one. We decided to check this place out due to some really great reviews (and most resto were booked so...) Sad to be the bearer of bad news but it was and is as \"Cannery\" as it can get. 

Food was mediocre, my Prime Rib was so tough, I must have eaten a quarter and was so done with it (ended up feeding it to the dogs). Scallop potatoes & cream of spinach were not properly cooked (still raw-ish). Only thing I enjoyed was the almond bread other than that nothing worth coming back for.

Service was good, quick in picking up the dirty dishes. But nothing memorable.

Pianist was playing great songs which we enjoyed. (But we were here for the food so on that note, save your money and go to outback - same quality of food)."}
{"text":"This is an awesome restaurant. t's definitely a little more on the fancy side, and the service was excellent. 

I went recently with my girlfriend and her parents, and all of the staff was excellent and helpful. For appetizer, we got the fried squid (calamari? I forgot) and Portabello Frites, which were both extremely good. The bread they serve is also excellent. For the main course, I had a grilled salmon and it was cooked very well. I may not know much about fine cooking or anything along those lines, but I loved every single bite of it. The chocolate cake they gave my girlfriend was also pretty great; it wasn't too sweet, and included with it was a dollop of house-made whipped cream. I literally have no complaints! Our waiter made us feel very at home and welcome. Would gladly come back for another round."}
{"text":"My hubby made reservations for my birthday and thank goodness - because this place is busy! There was a 45 minute wait list, but we got seated right away (love it when they honor reservations).

There was a live piano player who played all of the classics, yes even \"As Time Goes By.\" We felt pretty classy. I was wearing a tiara for my birthday, and I felt like I was treated accordingly. Frederick is a class act, and he took very good care of us. I can see he has a lot of fans on here, and he deserves it. He alone is enough to come back for - but then there's the food...

I don't know if it was a special thing for that Saturday, but a lady offered us a wine tasting. Not only did we fall in love with one of the wines, but the prices were actually reasonable! We each got two glasses.

I got the scallops and...well...the only nice way to put this is that they were so incredible I almost needed a towel and a cigarette afterwards. My husband laughed as he watched my eyes roll into the back of my head. From the break basket to the green beans, the entire meal was extraordinary.

Birthday girl got a free crème brûlée for dessert - HEAVEN!

I sneaked a peak at the bill - not scary at all! We got so much for such a reasonable price. I am sincerely impressed.

After seeing a movie in the luxury theater, this dinner was absolute perfection. Then, on to a concert right on the other side of the casino. It was a wonderful night, and all under one roof. We are already planning on our next excursion."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with Waverly's.  The service was impeccable and the food delicious!   A nice variety in the bread basket, and the rib eye melted in your mouth.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is our favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas.  The decor is nice, not over done or gaudy.  The tables and booths are spaced out and not on top of each other.  The staff are always friendly, engaging, and attentive.  And then there's the food...

So good.  If you're a soup fan, both the She-Crab and French Onion are second to none.  Their steaks are always perfect with marbeling, and always cooked perfect to how done you want them.  The sides are freakin' amazing and the vegetables always taste incredibly fresh.  Great wine selection and a full bar for those who enjoy a vodka, martini, or whatever you want!

It is pricey, I'd say $80-$140 for two, but I've always felt I got more than my money's worth there still."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST dinner I've had in Las Vegas in 15 years!  Top it off with fabulous service from Frederick, this place can't be beat.  We had three of us there for dinner.  The onion soup was perfect (not too salty like most other places), the raspberry viniagrette salad was delicious, the button mushrooms were huge and scrumptious, and we had prime rib (2) and filet with shrimp for our entrees.  The prime rib was over the top for flavor.  I just can't say enough about this place.  It's not often I think of dining here because it's in the Cannery, but I'm so thankful I remembered this hidden gem.  It's nice and quiet, food is great, and service is five star.  What more could you want?!"}
{"text":"I have tried most of the steakhouses in the area and by far this one is the worst. I had the NY  strip. It looked good when it came out but when I cut into it looked like the cow was just killed. I almost threw up. The waiter was nice but very slow. He apologized but it was not his fault the quality was crap. Don't waste your time or money"}
{"text":"We've been going to Waverly's for many, many years and have never had a bad meal. There are tons of steakhouses in Vegas but this place is my favorite. My steak is always cooked perfectly. Our favorite server is Frederick, we love him."}
{"text":"Just returned from a fabulous dinner to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday. Manager Todd and server Nils and the entire staff went out of their way to make our evening special and surprise us, including working with our relatives back East. The short ribs were succulent and tasty while the scallops were the best we have had in town.  Try the chocolate cake and creme brûlée for dessert. It was made to share. Waverlys never disappoints and always surprises with their attention to detail. It is one of our regular haunts and we will be back. Thank you.  Ask for a booth with Frederick or Nils."}
{"text":"Service was great. Shrimp cocktail came with huge shrimp!! Crab cakes were ok...but good nonetheless. The prime rib was cooked perfectly and the crust was so flavorful. The au jus was very good too. Only thing I thought was ok was the seafood Mac and cheese, crab cakes, and potato side dish."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to treat ourselves to the 3 course meal for $25 last night. You get to pick an appetizer,  a side, a main course, and you get a house salad included. First came the table bread. It was the most common, cheap, and cold bread you could amagine. 25 minutes later came a tiny house salad composed of diced iceberg. The appetizer; a cold half potato with what was supposed to be chicken inside. If there wad I didn't see or taste it. The main course was surprisingly very tasty and the portion size was healthy. For the side you get 4 choices.  3 of them are corn. We are both not fans of corn so we chose the baked potato with sour cream and chives. When we recieved our main course there was a piece of a dry potato and an ear of corn. I was confused.  I asked the gentleman who brought the food out who was not our waiter why we got corn when we asked for a potato with sour cream and chives.  All he could say was ' hot plate' over and over. Since it seemed English was not his first language he had our waiter come over.  Without apologizing he told us that he would bring over the sour cream.  The other man showed up with one small portion for the both of us.  When we had finished and needed a togo box I tried to waive the waiter down with no luck.  On the fourth time of him being in sight he was forced to acknowledge me because both my husband and myself had our hands in the air waiving around like we were drowning. I had half my food in the box when I had to reach for my phone in my purse.  The waiter came to our table reached over my open container and grabbed my half full plate and took it and all the silverware away like we were going to steal it.  He never said a word. We were in such shock that he cleared my plate of food that we felt like that was the final straw to our horrific dinning experience and had to leave. All in all the food could use some better quality control but it was the customer service that was appalling."}
{"text":"Don't be scared off by the cannery ...this is indeed a darn good steak house in a very mediocre casino. once we got over a reservation snafu when we first arrived  ..it was onward and upward from there. food and service are first rate. what makes cannery even extra special is that prices aren't nearly whats charged for similar food out on the strip. I had a delicious 16 oz. rib eye served perfectly medium..my wife had what she termed \"award winning\" blackened salmon and my son had a nice slab of prime rib. potatoes come with all the entrees. our waiter and his helper worked their butts off on a very crowded evening. Even the hostess/manager was assisting with delivery of meals. a true team effort. cocktails were potent...restaurant has an attractive ambiance....its all pretty positive and a very good value. After dinner we wandered outside to see America in 100 degree heat. great evening!"}
{"text":"Started out at the bar with a martini.  Atmosphere was inviting.  However they need to lose the portraits of fruits & vegetables on the wall.  Piano player was very talented.  Our server, Nils, was a PRO at their menu.  All his suggestions were well advised. He new the menu & product well. Started with the chopped salad and added house vinaigrette which was very fresh and flavorful.  Had the Portobello Frittes with pesto aioli sauce appetizer - all was fantastic!!!  Service was outstanding - manager came by to ask about our meal.  All staff was attentive. 
Had the shrimp & crab type of spicy gumbo over Jasmine Rice and the Macadamia Nut Crusted chicken.  We'd recommend both!!!  We'll be back in."}
{"text":"I had prime rib there and it was out of this world! Very worth the money.."}
{"text":"Loved the live piano music.  Our waiter was very attentive and had a great attitude.  The food was just not completely up to par.  

We started with the calamari and Portobello Frites.  The calamari was really good, but the frites lacked flavor; one was also a bit dry.

As for the entrees, the ribeye was cooked nice, but was not seasoned enough.  The lamb chops were too small (given 3; should have been 4 at that size).  The pan roast was good, but pales in comparison the Palace Station's Oyster Bar.  The cheese potato side was really good though.  

Overall, still a good experience, but the food definitely needs to catch up with the ambiance and staff.  Officially 3 1/2 stars, but since I can't do that, I'm trending downwards."}

So we ditched the kids and had a date night in vegas, we were staying in the Cannery and figured we'd just see what was in the hotel. I was not expecting this.

First off there was a live piano which in and of itself is pretty impressive.  In fact I was wearing shorts and a T-shirt and honestly felt bad about my attire.  This feels like a really fancy restaurant that you'd be paying 50+ a plate to eat at even if the food isn't that fantastic.  Well being that it was date night I had to have a margarita (one of my favorite treats thanks to living in New Mexico for 20+ years) which was great.

Based on the reviews of a few other people we decided to get the Portobello Frites which were absolutely amazing, and I'd highly recommend them to anyone. I got a steak and it wasn't any better or worse than most other restaurants so I can't really say come here for the steak but it was exactly what I ordered.

The service was fantastic, I wish I'd gotten the name of my server (or rather I remembered it 2 months after my visit as I've slacked on finishing up this review) as he was by far the best part of the meal and is the reason I'm giving Waverly's 4 stars instead of 3.

I honestly had no expectations going into this meal other than hopefully a lovely meal with the wife, I was impressed with how nice the place looked (even if it's just a facade for the tourists) the staff were dressed to the nines, the live pianist and the other small touches all made for a surprisingly elegant feeling evening for a price far lower than I expected based of what they were trying to appear to be."}
{"text":"Servers were on their toes and the 3 course meal was awesome. They offer different items each night for the 3 course meal option. Ours was the salad of choice or soup, bone in filet choice of potato and the vegetable was  asparagus. The entire meal was awesome, filet cooked and seasoned perfectly the garlic mashed potatoes were also very tastey. The desert that followed was as amazing as the rest of the entire meal although at this point i was full and could not enjoy the entire thing."}
{"text":"On a recent return to Waverly's, after dipping into the Bread Basket, I enjoyed an interesting Escargot with Mushroom Sauce, a nice alternative to the traditional Escargot Bourguignon or Escargot with Garlic Butter Sauce.  This was followed by a tasty and cheesy French Onion Soup with a large, fast deconstructing crouton.

For an entree I paired a very good medium-rare Petite Filet enhanced by good house-made Bearnaise Sauce, with a fairly sweet Lobster Tail and Au Gratin Potatoes that were quite yummy.  This time there were no temperature problems with the food; everything was served hot.

Service was fine and friendly, and seating was comfortable in wooden armchairs with uphostered seats.  A large scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream was a great counterpoint to an excellent, rich Molten Lava Cake.

This was a delightful 4-1/2 star experience!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Over priced and not impressed. My wife and I both ordered a fillet. Both were over cooked and tasteless. Portions were very small and  just not worth the time or money. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff. I usually get the chicken Cesar salad, always delicious. Beef wellington is amazing! Get portabello mushrooms for your appetizer. You won't be disappointed. Ask for Frederick for the best service."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I was a snob. I assumed that Cannery food was only for the drunk, broke, or desperate. 

I was wrong, and happily so. The meal I had was pretty terrific. Service was prompt, attentive, and my filet was one of the most tender steaks I've experienced in a long time. 

Oddly, I would recommend this establishment with all the Cannery caveats."}
{"text":"This place is honestly one of my husband and my favorite places to eat a nice meal.  The decor is wonderful and comfortable.  The booths huge you.  And the staff is amazing.  This last time we had a new waiter eddie, who turned out to be really great.  Our usual waiter even stopped by the say hi to us!  This place makes you feel special.  The food is phenominal!  everything tasts wonderful, and the wine is the best.  I am always excited when we plan our dinners here."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great ambience, nice bread bowl variety, but the food wasn't up to par. The salad was really weird finely chopped lettuce previously mixed with a vinaigrette until it is soft and mushy-looking. We made the mistake of ordering off the three-course menu. He got the brisket appetizer with ribs as the main entree. She got the battered shrimp appetizer and the brisket. All the food was smothered in about ten times more barbecue sauce than any normal person would ever want, but even after scraping off as much as we could, it was still too much. The corn on the cob had obviously been sitting for hours as it was mushy and inedible. His sweet potato was small but okay. The jalapeño spoon bread was cold and crusty. You know it's bad when we don't ask to take home leftovers as that's our normal thing (take some home for second dinner later on!) Perhaps it was our faults for ordering barbecue at a steakhouse, but for $25/person, you expect that it will be good regardless."}
