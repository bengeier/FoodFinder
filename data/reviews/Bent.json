{"text":"Duck salad - $15
My favourite dish out of the 6 we ordered. The portion was bigger than I expected. A good mix of textures and flavours. Warning: peanuts.

Rare beef - $16
There were 4 slices of soft rare beef. I thought it was ok..probably wouldn't order it again.

Tartare 2 ways - $10
1) Spicy tuna with avocado on a crispy rice cake
2) Salmon with shallots on a crispy rice cake
I enjoyed the tartare and the deep fried rice added a nice crunch

Braised spiced short ribs - $22
This was my least favourite dish but it was probably because I was expecting thinly sliced short ribs (like galbi short ribs). 

Shanghainese steamed pork belly with sauteed brandy apples - $19
The pork belly was ok.  I don't like cooked apples so that didn't appeal to me. 

Our meal came with complimentary dessert (I believe every diner gets it) which was a nice surprise. 

Service
We went shortly after it opened so we weren't surprised when there were a few dishes that were delivered to us by mistake, but the staff was very friendly. Kai came out to chat with us and apologized that we couldn't take a photo with Susur because it was during the dinner rush. 

Menu/prices
Overall, I liked our meal. It's out of my price range so I probably wouldn't go back unless it was a special occasion."}
{"text":"Finally went with a friend for dinner after my sister's glowing review and was very impressed   - interesting fusion dishes, well prepared and presented!    
The only reason I would give this Bent a 3.5/4 only because the tables and seating are so close together that it's uncomfortable (esp when servers can barely get through to get to your table)...I couldn't wait to leave and stretch and I'm a short person!

Overall worth trying for a interesting flavor combinations!"}
{"text":"Probably the best meal I've experienced in a very long time. and we eat out a lot. also the most expensive I've had to pay for in awhile:) Service was flawless. Food to die for. We ordered shashimi, polenta, spring rolls."}
{"text":"At first I didn't really get it, I had been to other Susur restaurants and truly enjoyed the food so I had high hopes for Bent but didn't know what to expect. Once the dishes started coming out it all made sense. Fusion restaurants can be very hit or miss, this place bent the rules and married flavors I never thought possible. I was there with a group of 4 and we ordered the entire winterlicious menu plus the Singapore slaw and braised beef so I got a great sampling of the menu. The octopus was the most tender thing I have ever enjoyed, the gnocchi was light and Asian inspired, not what you think of when you think gnocchi. The best for me, next to the melt In your mouth octopus, were the jerk spiced ribs. They are served with a clove spiced mashed potatoe and gravy, which sounds weird but IT ALL WORKS!! The beauty of this menu is the pairing of Asian flavors with western accompaniments and vice versa. It was like taking flavours from both sides of my family and seeing them on one plate. Confit tuna with a creamy soy sauce sauce!? Amazing!
Fantastically dangerous cocktail selection as well. 
A truly inspirational dining experience."}
{"text":"3.5/5
Went here for their summerlicious menu with a group of 3. 

Food 3.5/5
- started with the Cajun shrimp which was delicious and the best part of the meal
-I also tried the watermelon gazpacho which was a nice summer starter. 
-both dishes had a bit of heat 
-I had the salmon for the main. The salmon was perfectly cooked and the wine citrus butter sauce was so delicious. However, it came with sauteed mango ginger that was mushy and did not add anything to the plate.
-for dessert, the only choice was a trio of chocolate mousse on a cookie, mango panna cotta, and a banana spring roll with caramel sauce. I love dessert. Unfortunately, the chocolate mousse on a cookie was nothing special and the mango panna cotta tasted like fruit cocktail from the can. The best part of the trio was the banana spring roll with caramel sauce; however, that was mediocre at best.
-we did not get a chance to try the cocktails and had a bottle of new zealand white wine

Service was great: 5/5.

I would still come back to try the regular menu."}
{"text":"Good service, good food. Sitting on the patio in summer is a bonus. Plus, platter decor is pretty!"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!! 

Guys, seriously, this is the WORST restaurant ever. Food was good, but that's it. We just left there for a birthday party, we had 11 people, and we got the rudest, most pretentious server (tall thin guy with a ponytail). He literally got visibly upset when we the orders didn't come to $35/person. Then he stated that the house \"rules\" are that everybody is \"required\" to spend $35 minimum. If these minimums are not met, then we'd be charged the $35 anyways. NO WHERE does it state when you make a reservation online from your phone that there's this \"magical\" minimum, and no where does it state on the menu that there's a minimum. He completely ruined the meal, and got everybody's order wrong. When we asked the host to speak to a Manager, the Manager didnt' come until AFTER the meal was over... probably because he knew he knew what was coming... The Manager was great, he didn't enforce their \"$35 minimum\" if that was a real thing (we're certain the server made it up to maximize his tip). 

Food - My beef tacos were tasty, but my wife got sick from their luke warm lobster tacos... the tacos were the size of a thumb, you get 4, for $16. Average entree price was $30. TERRIBLE value... 

Summary - TERRIBLE SERVICE, POOR VALUE, COMPLETELY DISORGANIZED, OVER-RATED. Stay away... you'll thank me later... or you'll remember what I said when you experience it for yourself..."}
{"text":"Glad Toronto has another great restaurant to patronize!

I ate there last night (Nov 22/13). Very busy place, I liked this.  A small sized room, I liked this. Geographically situated on the border of China Town and Little Portugal, quite symbolic, wither intentional or not, I like this. 

The food: It started out slow and anxious since the fresh shucked oysters were slightly warm and their top sides dry. This mightn't  be bad for most since most add the sauces ( I eat them plain) but I've ate many an oysters in the past  and personally I prefer them cold, with plenty of the sea water juice remaining inside. I also found them on the large side but that's just a personal preference. 

Then we shared the TRUFFLED JAPANESE BEEF CARPACCIO. The texture contrast was ideal, the smell complex and pleasing, the presentation elongated excellence,  the taste close to perfect, the only scent not effected was my hearing and perhaps it was whispering something majestic but it was too loud for us to catch it. However  for whatever  reason there was a hint of too much vinegar in the underlying water based sauce yet this might have been because I negligently let the top most parts sit too long in the juice below.

My wife had the BRAISED SPICED SHORT RIBS and loved it.

I had the ROASTED SCALLOP WITH SUNDRIED TOMATO CRUST and it was the  zenithal point of the meal. I couldn't help thinking these scallops had to have been fried first but they weren't, I have to think it must be far harder to bake them and still get them to the table like this, these were perfectly cooked with perfect texture and their natural taste complimented the sublime textured and tasty crust. 

The wine is a touch too expensive but the food's reasonably priced.

We'd just come from the Bowie exhibit  at the AGO and  exited past the Bernini sculpture of Pope Gregory XV, so this dinner was a perfect finish to a night of artistry. From a world renown musician, to a legendary sculptor, to master chief(s). 

I'd argue the food at these places are the highest art form because it involves the artist managing four of the five senses and the best thing is its a kind of fleeting art that's eaten, made only for you.

There, I will return."}
{"text":"Recently visited Bent with a large group which is a bonus because it afforded me the opportunity to try more items than I normally could. 

To start, I had one of their well known lobster tacos (14). These were delicious, with the zesty tomato salsa complementing the large chunk of lobster meat! Next up was some fresh oysters (15) - we opted for the black pepper balsamic mignonette. This was so so - the BBB mignonette wasn't very noticeable, the oysters were ok but nothing special. After that, we went for the sashimi tasting (19). This was definitely a highlight as the charred scallop was perfectly done and the tuna was fresh. 

Next up was the pressed octopus (14). This was an interesting dish - it is literally a flat piece of octopus (hence the name). I wasn't overly impressed as it tasted somewhat bland, but the texture is nice. Sadly, it didn't look anything like it does on their website. Following the octopus, we enjoyed the Kale+Tofu Salad (10). This satisfied the vegan in our group. The portion is definitely larger than the other items and the items go well together. However, the sesame dressing did come on a bit strong. 

At this point, it was time for the heavy hitting meat dishes. I'm not much of a wine person and the beer options were somewhat limited. However, I definitely appreciated the Amsterdam Boneshaker IPA (8) - so much hops, so much flavour! 

First on the meat dishes was the crispy chicken dumpling (13). The presentation was nice: cute little fried dumplings that sort of look like the ones you get from Chinese Takeout. The parmesan emulsion was heavenly, the dumplings themselves were moderate. Finally, the final dish was the braised spiced short ribs (22). These apparently have been cooking for 12 hours. I was definitely a big fan and they satisfied my carnivorous appetite - the meat was very soft and very flavorful. 

Dessert: this was a surprise as there wasn't a dessert menu. It was nice, but my memory fails to recall what it was. Possibly because of all the food I ate. The meal was topped off with an Americano that was nothing special. 

The atmosphere was casual. Service was great - friendly, not stuck up. Susur Lee was around and was friendly. 

Overall, the experience at Bent was good albeit pricey for what you get. I won't be rushing back here, but I would have no hesitation to return in the future."}
{"text":"Service wasn't bad, although I've had better. 
Susur's salad is always good. The tuna and watermelon ceviche has a wonderful marinade that's got the perfect combination of sweet/spicy/sour/salty. The vegan roll was not bad, but probably wouldn't order again. The beef tacos were delish."}
{"text":"8 of us went to bent for my birthday. 
Nice place but they need the music to be loader in the background. 
I think we ordered almost anything on the menu. 
Wasn't impressed by the food at all.  Ok..... The lobster tacos were tasty but other than that average at best. 
Also quite pricy. I was really excited to go a dine there as I love Asian fusion food but I ain't going back."}
{"text":"I have heard only good things about this place, so hubby and I decided to check it out. 

We sampled a few things on the menu, including tuna watermelon cerviche, kale and tofu salad and a sashimi platter. The dishes were well crafted and nicely presented.

I would consider coming back to try more on their menu!"}
{"text":"went two bent last night for summerlicious and the foo was amazing had the watermelon ceviche, jerk chicken and the trio dessert that was amazing ! the service however was TERRIBLE the server came to the table and then disappeared for 15 min the manager came over and took our drink order cause he realized something was wrong ... waiter came and asked if we wanted a drink 5 min after the manager came... then the bus girl seen our drinks empty when  we received our food .. server still not in site ordered a glass with dinner did not come till dessert .. was sitting at the bar pass our entire meal .... the only time he came again was to give the bill ... absolutely brutal luckily it was 4 of us so we kept ourselves entertained .. well the bar bill was low so we went somewhere that wanted to serve us ... food was great and cool atmosphere .."}
{"text":"I had dinner here for Summerlicious with my boyfriend. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. Our table was against the bar, which I thought was really unique. Unfortunately, it took a little bit too long for someone to take our order, especially considering the restaurant was not too busy. Luckily the food made up for this! We had the Singapore Slaw, which was just as delicious as we remembered from Lee. Our favorites from the Summerlicious menu were the Duck Confit and Goat Cheese spring roll and the Miso Black Cod. Honestly, the cod was the best fish dish either of us have ever had. So flavorful and the cod just melted in your mouth. We did end up sending one of our dishes back to the kitchen, but the servers handled this with complete grace, the kitchen fixed the issue very quickly and we were offered a round of drinks on the house. 

Overall, the experience was not perfect, but we enjoyed the food and atmosphere. I would recommend Bent to those looking for a casual environment with upscale food."}
{"text":"Celebrated Valentines dinner and tried out Bent for the first time (down the street from where we live).    Judging from the other reviews complimenting the service, I guess due to the rush we experienced quite the opposite. 

Servce: Horrible. Very slow to get our drinks. The appetizer did not come for over and hour (after attempting to bring ours mains on two separate occasions) and when it finally arrived we were not served part of the first course (realized this later in the meal while people around were served their starter of the prix fixe). We had not even finished the first course when our third course came (meat course).  After finishing our third course, we waited a half hour for the second fish course to arrive. The dessert did arrive in a timely fashion after the fish! The staff was not attentive, they forgot to serve part of the meal (and did not offer comp drinks or anything after the meal), dirty plates sat in front of us until the next course was served. I really wanted to like this place too.

Food: Fixed price menu for Valentines. Great starter with about 8 different items in a 'bent-o' box.   We had short ribs and red snapper. The short ribs were great, tender with delicious sides. The snapper on the other hand was over cooked and did not pack much flavour. Overall, food was 4/5 due to starter and short ribs. Dessert was good for people who like dessert.

As I've said, I really wanted to like this place since its 3 mins away, but will likely not be back soon."}
{"text":"Checked it out just last night with a friend.  We happened to luck out since Susur, Kai, Levi and guest chef Makoto were all there....translation - food was amazing.

Keep in mind that they don't take reservations.  We got there just a bit after 6pm and we were seated really quickly.  That was perfect timing because about 30mins later the place was filled.  

It's nice casual atmosphere and the servers are really attentive.  To the point where we had just gotten seated and not a couple minutes go by before someone was over to take our drink orders.

Not sure if having guest chefs are going to be a regular thing but it's certainly a great idea.  It's a \"pop-up\" as our waiter explained.  Left side of the menu are the Bent regulars and the right is the menu from the featured guest.

Off the regular menu we had the braised short rib.  It was amazing - but the pureed parsnip was a tad on the runny side.  My boyfriend is a bit of a foodie and mentioned that they were a bit heavy on the cream.  We also tried the duck salad.  Presentation wise - very appealing and it's actually more filling than we had expected.

From the featured menu we had the air bread tuna. This had to be my favorite of the night.  Yuzu foam infused into a light airy bread with tuna, jalapeno etc on top.  It sits on this wasabi mayo concoction that was just so yummy you want to lick it off the plate.  Other hits were the toro and salmon tartare and braised wagyu beef tongue.  

A great addition to this up and coming neighbourhood.  I can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, but the servce is really off putting.

My boyfriend and I came for dinner on the patio on a  Friday night. When we arrived around 6:30 it was not busy aside from 3 other tables on the patio. We were offered water and not asked for a drink order. We waited 15 mins for a drink and food order. Since it was our first time the waiter let us know that it was small plates encouraged for sharing. He told us about  3-5 dishes. Since we had plans to go elsewhere for dessert we selected beef taco, lobster taco, and a green bean salad. All very delicious ! 

Here's where it gets weird. 

Another waiter came to refill water. I said no thank you, but he insisted on filling my glass, reaching across me, my plate, and my drink, very awkwardly to do so. A different waiter came to ask how everything was, and then another to see if we needed more drinks. 

I value service that is discrete and polite, and bent simply did not deliver. It is ostentatious with 5 differnt people helping you for every little thing. I want to feel that the one person serving me is attentive to my personal needs and have some sort of personal interaction with them even on a miniscule level. 

Too many waiters!!! 

Even walking to the washroom from the patio is difficult because there are about 10 waiters standing beside tables you need to navigate around.

After we ate, my boyfriend asked for the bill and the (original) waiter said to him \" oh are you sure you don't want to order anything else?\" He said no thank you and the waiter pressed him again  saying \"really? Nothing else???\" Very awkward and very pushy!!"}
{"text":"I visited Toronto last month and had the pleasure of dining at Bent. We tried about 10 different dishes with each one being better than the next. I particularly loved the short-rib."}
{"text":"Decided to finally visit the infamous Bent on Saturday.

Two of us tried a variety of dishes. Below are the most notable dishes we tried.

tuna watermelon ceviche: I enjoyed this dish. I would have to say that it felt as though there was almost too much flavour in each bite. The watermelon was very fresh, tuna was nice and the sauce was sort of sour which balanced the flavours well. One the best parts of this dish was the doughnut fritters.. sooo good!

Best dish of the night were the short ribs. They were so tender and flavourful. And the sauce was absolutely amazing. Potatoes were ok, nothing too fancy.

For desert we tried the Tong Yuen. You get 4 balls with a burst a sweetness when you bite into them. They were really good so we ordered a second round of the same desert. 

The service overall was very good. We were seated quickly. I'm taking one star off the rating mainly because the time between two of the dishes was way too long (more than 30 minutes) and I felt like the tuna watermelon ceviche could have a bit more balance in terms of flavours."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here the other night with some friends visiting from the U.S.  Susur was in the house which is always nice to see.  We were a little annoyed with the aggressive recommendations of the server (shocking, but all her recommendations were at the most expensive range of the menu), but we ordered what we wanted and were more than pleased.  The hamachi was excellent as was the tuna ceviche.  The dumplings were fine, but nothing special, and the kale/tofu salad had great flavors.  We finished off with the scallops (so tasty) and the lamb which incorporated some really interesting Indian flavors.  The free dessert was a bonus, and the cocktails were great.  All in all, wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Good lively ambiance and enthusiastic wait staff.   Service was a bit rushed. Menu was creative and sounded promising, but fell short on delivery.  Oyster sake shot while flavourful, the herb garnish did not lend itself to \"shooting\" it. Lobster tacos were too cold and somewhat flavourless. PEI oysters were overpriced to market. Jerk chicken was nothing special. Wine list was good. Very disappointing and will not return."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday dinner here this past Friday, and despite the delicious food the overall experience was a disappointment due to the terrible service. 

To begin we had to ask our server to take a drink order and had received three dishes before we even had a glass of wine in our hand. After our meal we sat with empty dessert plates and had to flag down our server to ask for coffee and tea. And finally, after finishing the coffee/tea we sat for ages and eventually had to get up to find our server and ask for our bill to be brought over. 

Quite disappointing. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"One thing is for sure, you can not dispute the service at Bent. All the servers were super attentive, constantly checking in and taking the time to explain each dish as it was served and tidying the table in between each serving.

The place is quintessential Dundas West, small and new age retro. Its very loud and a bit dim. Susur Lee was watching over his staff and checking in with patrons. 

We were told the servings were family style and we should order anywhere between 3-5 dishes depending on which dishes we choose. Since it was just me and a girlfriend we ordered 4 dishes with the expectation that it would more than enough. 

We ordered the Lobster Tacos, the Duck Confit & Goat Cheese Spring Rolls, the Pressed Octopus and the Braised Spice Short Ribs. They aren't kidding when they describe their dishes as small but with big flavour. The dishes were all delicious. The short ribs were so tender, only downfall is there were only 2. As for the lobster tacos, there was 4 mini tacos. Again delicious but small portions. We loved the duck confit rolls, 4 in total. And the pressed octopus was good but not on par with the other options. I think its a big stretch to say 3-5 dishes is enough for 2 people. I think considering that each dish is an appetizer portion, 3-5 dishes if enough for each individual. 

Bent loses 5 stars because for all the money spent, you would think the portions would be more generous and moreover should be more generous. Overall dining at Bent is like dining at an upscale cocktail hour."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious and it was the best meal I've ever had. The black cod! Dear lord, ate it as slow as humanly possible to savour every bit. Server was wonderful as well. Definitely recommend grabbing dinner here."}
{"text":"4/5.highly recommend chef selection! My favourites include kale tofu salad, lobster tacos, oyster shots and tuna/watermelon dish! Great presentation and service:)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I booked a reservation for our anniversary dinner a month in advance. I was adamant that we booked Bent for our special occaision, having been twice before (once for a holiday party). We were both very excited to treat ourselves to an expensive dinner. We arrived, were seated quickly at a nice table. 

It took about 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order, and another 10 for the drinks to arrive. I should say up front that any one of these events alone would not have bothered us at all, but altogether, they created a horrible dining experience. We ordered four dishes - the slaw, the tuna sashimi, the gnocchi and the beef.  The slaw arrived quickly and was delicious. Another 30 minutes went by and a server (not ours) brought over the tofu dish. We assumed this was a mix up but then our server came over and was sure we ordered the tofu. I listed off our order and he agreed that he had made a mistake. Instead of having the sashimi first we were told the gnocchi would be coming out first. No problem, we were just hungry. The gnocchi flavour was excellent, but it tasted dry like it had been sitting under a heat lamp. Very disappointing. Another long wait for our raw dish of sashimi to come out, followed by another long wait for the beef. Both dishes were good but by the time they came out the experience had been soured considerably.

Here's the thing. Even with all of this, our experience could have been saved. We asked for our bill, disappointed & wanting to leave. When our server finally brought the bill over, he also brought two spoons and said that he hoped we weren't in too much of a rush to leave. His solution was a complimentary dessert that caused us to wait even longer to settle up our bill and leave. Eventually the credit card machine was brought over and the server continued to apologize for the experience. A manager also came over to apologize for the experience. When you are spending hundreds of dollars (pre tax and tip) and both staff and management neglect to comp even a round of drinks to make up for a bad experience, that is just unacceptable. I will never be back."}
{"text":"Great food! Your taste buds won't be disappointed and the wait staff are knowledge, helpful and efficient. A gem and must try for anyone who is up to explore a bit of east meets west. I recommend the tacos, watermelon tuna ceviche, short ribs, and lamb. Dessert- try 'em all!
Had the honor of meeting Mr Lee himself which topped the evening!"}
{"text":"Charming little spot with amazing food. We had the tasting menu paired with sake. Everything was divine. There were so many delicious and interesting small plates, each was incredible in it's own unique way. The chef's tasting menu was the perfect amount of food - we left completely satiated but not stuffed. Also loved the tiny collections displayed in the back of the restaurant. A completely lovely experience. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We planned to arrive around 9 on a Thursday, and we thought we might have to bend over backwards to get into the no-reservations Bent (see what I did there?), Susur Lee's new restaurant, designed and opened in cahoots with his wife (Brenda Bent) and attractive sons, who were unfortunately missing on this fine evening.

Fortunately, we didn't. 

First glances impress - a wall of colorful trinkets (blocks and plastic toys among them), encased in glass shelving, is a treat to the eye. The tables are a deep-coloured wood and finished in a shiny resin. The fish display behind the bar, showcasing local the lake catch and a colorful array of spicy peppers (presumably for ceviche), makes the mouth water. Susur is looking his best in navy cooking attire - a far cry from the white robe and jeans he sometimes wears at Lee.

The vibe? Lively and hip yet unpretentious.

The drinks? Excellent. An Asian Caesar is made with homemade clamato juice, and includes pickled ginger and cilantro. Unique and satisfying. The elderberry liqueur cocktail tastes somewhat similar to drinking a summer garden.

The food? Good, but occasionally hit and miss. The tuna dishes come highly recommended; we opt for the ceviche version with watermelon. The marinada darkens the melon and the dish plays a trick on the eye. Am I eating fish or fruit? The tuna is delicious, and the marninade has a fantastic, deep kick; if only there was more tuna hidden in there. Watermelon is yummy. Raw tuna is yummier.

The duck salad is reminiscent of a mini-Singapore Slaw at Lee, with crackling and breast sprinkled in, piled on a sharing plate. Flavorful and pleasing to the eye - I could probably eat this all night  if it had a bit more duck. 

A kale and tofu salad? Recommended, but a disappointment. I could probably make something similar at home. A small portion that is lacking flavor.

Cod tacos are presented in taro root shells - a nice Asian fusion twist. The cod is smoked and the toppings crunchy. Good, but these could use a bit more \"juice\" to tie it all together.

The beef shortribs are tender and reminiscent of Lee's braised beef, but fatty.

Dessert - on the house - is a gooseberry snack and rice ball with sesame. Both taste decent; neither overwhelms.

Bent is fun. It's hip. It's reasonably affordable. Does it live up to its hype? The jury is still out. I like Lee so much that I'll try Bent again - but I'm hoping for a step up next time. You should try for yourself to decide."}
{"text":"I had the broiled beef ($31) and cooked Panna dessert(12). Excellent. Your paying for the plating here, so be prepared."}
{"text":"My husband and I attended a Lincoln event in this restaurant tonight and must say that we really enjoyed it. 
It was a 3 course meal which we shared. We had the Singapore Slaw and Coconut Shrimp + Green Curry Soup for our appetizers. I liked the slaw but did not care for the soup. It tasted more like something to put on top of rice than soup. The temperature was just warm, not hot. It might be a preference but I like my soup piping hot. For mains, we got the Caramelized Salmon and Chicken Jerk Roulade. I loved both main courses. They both had nice flavour combinations and the sides were delicious too! We cleaned these plates. For dessert we got the Warm banana and chocolate chip cake and the apple crumble. The banana and chocolate chip cake was great. It had a subtle Asian flavour to it since they added a Caramelized jackfruit on the bottom of the cake. The apple crumble was just ok. 
Service was amazing and very professional. All in all, we were really impressed with everything."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were here last week. We choose the summerlicious menu and we enjoyed every bite of what we ordered. The food is fusion and so the cocktails. Very refreshing and  you can taste the fusion of the different flavours. Everyone was very nice and the its bright and lively. There is something for everyone to try. Summerlicious menu plus four cocktails was $150 with tax."}
{"text":"Went here last night (Thursday evening) with a girlfriend.  We had planned to meet around 6:30.  When I got there, it wasn't too busy, but like another reviewer had mentioned, within an half hour to an hour the place was pretty busy.

The atmosphere is very cool & casual.  There are tables as well as bar type seats where the chefs/kitchen staff cook/prepare the food.  Along the windows on the side, there is additional seating. 

Cocktails I would say are on the expensive side...I had the Asian Caesar...but honestly it was pretty tasty.  But I could definitely see how you could end up spending a lot of money on drinks.

We shared 4 dishes:  The tartare 2 ways, the duck salad, chicken dumplings and the cod taro tacos.  Everything was excellent.  I would say 4 dishes is enough food for 2 people.

Worth noting....the service.  It was as good as it gets.  We first started out with one server, who got us our drinks.  Then Kai (Bent-Lee) took over.   He made sure to come by often (but not too often) to check if we needed anything and to ask how the food was - this occurred even as the night got busier.  Each dish was brought out by a different staff member from the kitchen, who would explain the dish.  When we had finished all of our food, they brought out complimentary dessert, which was a nice touch.

For a restaurant that is fairly new, they are doing everything right.  It obviously runs in the family...

I will definitely be back to try more dishes on the menu that I didn't get to try.

For 2 of us, with one drink each and 4 dishes shared, we spent just over $55 each (tip and tax included)."}
{"text":"We were very existed when we learned about Bent's seafood tasting menu because Susur Lee is in charge of the Bent's kitchen and the restaurant is operated by his sons Kai and Levi Bent Lee.  We even cancelled our reservation at somewhere else that night because the tasting menu was ending on the very next day (at least for some reasons we thought so). 

Susur Lee's wife, Branda Bent-Lee, was behind the interior design of Bent. I really appreciate the little details that she  added at different places in the restaurant. The atmosphere was very lively and casual. Yet, it was kind of loud that JW and I had a hard time talking.


Bent's seafood tasting bent-o box included a wide selection of items that can be found on their menu. We thought this would be a great opportunity to try out some of their dishes. The tasting bent-o box costs $35 from 5-7 and $42 from 7 onwards.

The tasting bent-o box included:

:: Lime Coconut-Curry Shrimp Soup
The soup was light and had a good balance of curry, coconut and different spices. It was not spicy and very refreshing. Although the portion was small, you can find a lot of different components so each spoon was filled with unique texture and flavour.  We enjoyed the soup very much.


Shortly after, a server came up to us and explained what was contained in the dish that she was holding. I simply said okay thinking that it was just one of the bento box dishes as it was so loud in the restaurant and I could barely hear her.  After she put down the salad, JW told me that the salad was not part of the bento box. Opps.

The salad was basically different marinated vegetables including beets, carrots, beans and kohlrabi. Not very strong in flavour and easy in the mouth.

Then the rest of the dishes came on a tray like a large bento box:

 :: Spicy Peruvian Style Ceviche
The dish was served cold.  The white snapper and calamari were mixed with Aji Amarillo chili and fresh lime juice and served in the middle. The mussels and clams were served on the side with only a little bit of sauce drizzled on top. We could barely taste the flavour of the white snapper and calamari because the sauce was too spicy for us. Yet the mussels and clams were deliciously flavoured since it was not drowned in the chili.


:: Pressed Octopus
This was JW's favourite dish. The octopus was chewy and did not have much flavour on its own. Yet, the pomegranate vinaigrette and olive oil gave an interesting hint of sweetness and saltiness.


:: Spicy Tuna Avocado Tartare
I was expecting the deep fried rice cake and tuna to be freshly fried yet it was served cold again. I would prefer them to be nice and hot.


::Lobster Tacos
One of the taco came in a wonton shell and the other one in a taro shell. I preferred the taro shell since it added a hint of taro to the lobster filling. JW, on the other hand, preferred the wonton shell because of its crispiness. Yet they were both equally delicious. The lobster was very fresh.



:: Oyster Sake Shot
First, we do not like oysters. Marinated in lemongrass, shallots and ponzu sauce, we took it in one shot. Although not as gross as fresh oysters, it was still not our thing.



:: Tuna+Watermelon Ceviche
The dish was way too sour. We couldn't taste the tuna at all because the citrus juice was very very sour. Glad there was the watermelon to balance off the sourness. The Chinese doughnut fritter added an contrasting texture to dish but it did not really go with the watermelon nor the tuna.



:: Asian Style Atlantic Salmon Gravlax
When put into the mouth, the japanese omelette wrapped around the salmon completely and added a hint of sweetness that tasted like pancake to the salmon. Although the softness and doughiness was not very flattering, it created an interesting experience in the mouth when mixed with the salmon.


In addition to the bent-o box, we also ordered the Braised Spiced Short Ribs. The braised short rib was so so soft and juicy. Although the parsnip puree had a very strong scent of truffle which we loved, it was weirdly a little too sweet.



The short rib also came with roasted duck fat potato. Very delicious. You can never go wrong with the roasted potato.



The meal ended with complementary desserts. 

Verdict:

Not roasted! 

Our time at Bent was an unique and impressive experience as we tried out different combinations of texture and flavour that are unheard of in other restaurants. But we realized that it was not our thing. Most of the dishes were overpowered by the sauce and we could not taste the natural flavour of the food. When the flavours of all the dishes were added together, it was just too overwhelming. Yet, we still look forward to our next visit to other Susur Lee's restaurants.

{"text":"Definitely a place I would return to! 

The good was great! 

The lobster taco was delicious. It had a lot of flavours in it but nothing too overpowering. The taro shell was a nice twist! 

The watermelon tuna salad was absolutely delicious. It was so refreshing and flavourful! I recommend this dish! My favourite one! 

The beef carpaccio had lots going on but it worked perfectly. The ponzu sauce and garlic chips definitely enhanced this dish.

On the other hand, the duck confit spring rolls were very disappointing. The cheese and the duck did not go too well together. It did however did taste like I was eating a Peking duck with the sauce and the crunch of the spring roll. 

The tofu salad was not great as well. The tofu is a firm tofu and was too heavy. The tofu itself was too big and lacked flavours. 

The service is amazing! Warm welcome with fast seating. The servers are quick to refill glasses and to remove dishes. But the place is very noisy and not recommended for kids."}
{"text":"We had dinner this evening with friends. We were looking forward to it and had read several mixed reviews. 

We went with an open mind  And decided to try the winterlicious menu. 

The restaurant itself was loud but, not packed. It had some nice style features like the front light fixture and the shellacked wood tables with the flash of red. Kinda had a generic look like so many \"hip\" restaurants in the city. 

 The Asian Caesar was rather tasty, worth the $16. We hope that with that price there was actually alcohols in it, because it was hard to tell. 

The food was mostly good to great but, sadly not amazing. The tuna tar tar that accompanied the black pepper charred salmon, was fantastic. The charred salmon itself, just okay. The provincials artichoke soup was good but rather cold. The servers  took a very long time to clear plates and return to ask for round two of drinks. Started to feel annoyed that 4 or more people had already been to our table. 

 Next up, with a unusually long wait in between first course and second; were the short rib cannelloni gratinee, it was good but probably would not order again. Then the shrimp ravioli with scallops. It  had potential however the dish had too many different things going on. With garlicky scallops, some kind of polenta/tofu cake, one stuffed ravioli and Swiss chards The plate looked beautiful, like picture worthy, but the tastes varied with each bite from great to ummm mediocre. 

Dessert came on a tray of two.  It was good sized portions. The crispy apple purse was tasty.  Would have gone very well with coffee had a sever returned to ask. The vanilla panna cotta  was terrible, I like sweet and it was just not working in my mouth.  The flavour combos did not match and I actually didn't finish it. 

The service was terrible.  We had 5-7 people at our table during the 2.5 hours.  One server who did come to clear our plates stood and rushed my partner to finish there last few bites. Not friendly or organized servers, they tried to explain the dishes but, did so poorly.  The services actually took away from what could have been a higher score. 

With a few drinks each at $15-16 each and the value of a winterlicious menu it was still an expensive dinner out. You would expect service to be a lot more polished and the timing and food to be more consistence to a great or even fabulous score. 

Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Mediated by mixed-reviews all-around, I'm giving this place 3-stars (3.5 would be ideal). 

The short and sweet:

FOOD: While most of the dishes (scallops, octopus ceviche) were outstanding and the kitchen staff's skill was obvious (perfectly prepared oysters), some dishes (like the cod tacos) fell flat on our taste buds... ultimately the menu just didn't feel very cohesive, portions were rather small, and we didn't feel comfortably full despite ordering the recommended number of dishes. 

We'd originally came for the sriracha-infused ceasars and were not disappointed! Excellent bar staff, if not just a bit slow. 

STAFF: Waitstaff were attentive, but schizophrenic about every detail. (I'm not sure whether this was the norm, of because Susur himself was observing from the entrance of the kitchen.)

Our dishes were cleared away while I was still chewing on my last bite, and long before I'd worked up the courage to go back for one last morsel of the luscious lemongrass jelly and Chantilly cream lemon pudding.

While I can't say I felt rushed, it was too much; too much service; too much tidying, napkin folding; too much clearing and cleaning; too much eagerness to help you design the perfect menu and to recommend.... jeez guys! Where's that relaxed nonchalant hipster foodie atmosphere we know and have come to expect?! (see: Black Hoof)

TWO-CENT FINAL WORD: This young restaurant could use some time to settle into the Trinity-Bellwoods atmosphere despite the strong culinary backbone (and quality) provided by Toronto's beloved Susur Lee."}
{"text":"We had the summerlicious menu and also ordered their famous Singaporean slaw and the crab tacos from their regular menu.
Both the slaw and tacos came rather quickly but none of the summerlicious dishes arrived at our table after we were seated for exactly one hour. 

The slaw was legit, but probably because it was so famous I was actually a bit disappointed. And I personally hate ginger; slaw had a rather strong taste of ginger to it.

Then most of our dishes were too sour, including the Crab Tacos, Salmon Tartare (summerlicious) and the Tiramisu and Lemon Marshmallow from the dessert trio (summerlicious). 

The only dish I truly liked was the braised beef main (summerlicious). The beef was flavourful and tender, and paired up so well with the mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Bent last night for Summerlicious. Even though we were embarking upon a 3-course meal (which really, feels like a 6-course meal because it's tapas), we had to get the famous 19-ingredient Singaporean-style Slaw. And I'm glad we did - it was amazing. I don't think we said 2 words to each other until the plate was licked clean. I'll be coming back for this signature plate alone.

The Summerlicious plates, on the other hand, were average but the presentation was on point. Could it be that the slaw was packed with so much out-of-this-world flavour that everything else I had after the matter was just \"meh\"? Who knows. I'll have to come back to check out the rest of their menu once Summerlicious is over.

A few more noteworthy mentions are the attentive and knowledgeable servers and the overall warmth of the restaurant. Try to get a table on the patio if you can!

Susur Lee is a slaw genius. That is all."}
{"text":"The duck and goat cheese spring rolls are delicious and the lobster tacos are to die for. It was pretty busy so we had to sit at the bar to eat but the bartenders were so entertaining making all these fancy drinks right in front of us. The servers describe everything in such great detail which is cool. I really liked the atmosphere at Bent, I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great meal.  The service here was very good and every dish we ordered was exceptional.  The Yuzu Bourbon Sour is a great drink too.

I highly recommend the chef's special slaw, it definitely lives up to the hype!  Other items you must eat: Lobster tacos, Scallops (best I have EVER had), the Wild Shrimp and Shrimp Dumpling plate, and the Tuna and Watermelon ceviche.

I am not from Toronto but undoubtedly will eat here every time I visit. Thanks Bent!"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I went there in December 2013 for dinner. We ordered some cocktails, a bottle of wine, 3 appetizers and 2 mains. Everything was delicious EXCEPT our main of scallops. Disgusting. Old scallops- smelled and tasted bad. We left the majority of the plate untouched. When the server came to clean off our table, she didn't ask if anything was wrong with it or how we enjoyed the food. Nada. THAT was disappointing."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this restaurant. First off, Christian the manager is the person that honestly assists in making this restaurant absolutely amazing. His customer service, care for dietary restrictions and knowledge on food items and recommendations is absolutely impeccable. We have dined here many times and highly suggest the chef's choice menu. No matter what the dietary restrictions they always try to accommodate. The flavours are amazing and you cannot find food like this anywhere else. Again, Christian, the manager has been so wonderful and his customer service is like no other. He truly cares and loves what he does, which shows. Highly recommend this restaurant. Any chef susurlee restaurant in Toronto is worth trying especially if you're a foodie."}
{"text":"The tasting menu was a great deal! And all seven dishes were amazing. The dessert was not included in the tasting which I would prefer that they mentioned at the beginning.....the banana and chocolate cake was out of this world."}
{"text":"A foodie must! The Singapore slaw brings memories of its origins however that is where it ends. The marriage of tastes and synergy within uncommon combination plates will not disappoint. I recommend (beyond the expected 'slaw') the grilled pressed octopus and caramelized black cod. Make sure you save room for dessert and as for their signature dish to finish your meal. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"The stuffed spring rolls are a must.

The caprese salad is good.minimal.

You should get 3-4 plates each to be full by the end.

Service is good.

The portions are small for most dishes, so keep that in mind... Some are surprisingly filling while others not so much. 

The people beside us had the ribs and it looked great, but their tacos looked pretty tiny"}
{"text":"Went for winterlicious. Ordered the Singapore Slaw (additionally, not part of their pre-set menu) and it was amazing. Definitely the best part of the entire meal! Rest of it was okay, nothing amazing. Service was terribly slow, had to wait 20min for our bill to come after asking twice, and our main dish took 45min to arrive after our appetizer dishes were removed. Extremely slow."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I came here last night with a couple of friends. One who had dined here before. She tried the tasting menu before and recommended it. So we asked about it and the server said it would be around $50 or so per person and would include about 8 dishes. 

They brought out the 19 ingredient Singapore slaw and mixed it up at the table. It's a gorgeous salad and tasted divine. They brought out 10 dishes in total including dessert and we were raving about each as we ate them. Dishes that followed were black peppered charred salmon (sashimi), truffled Japanese beef carpaccio, avocado roll, lobster taco, spicy tuna and watermelon ceviche, vegetable fritter, roasted scallop with sundries tomato crust, braised spiced short ribs, and tong yuen for dessert.  All the food was delicious, cooked perfectly and presented beautifully. Each dish was explained to us and each one tasted very different from the others. This was honestly one of the best meals that I have had in a long time. We were definitely full by the end.  

When the bill came out, it was only $60 per person. This is a great price for what you get. I loved all the variety of food that I was able to try. 

The service was very good. The restaurant itself has a retro casual feel and filled up very quickly. It got louder at night. I really enjoyed my overall experience here especially the food. I would definitely recommend the coming here and trying the tasting menu. And I can't wait to come back."}

I've read somewhere that bent was opening but wasn't really interested in going, not until I started seeing photos of these bent-o boxes on twitter (damn you twitter! *shakes fist).
They were just so colorful and pretty! and especially with the 'avail for limited time only' and $35 for 2 price tag as long as you went before 7PM, I had to check it out.

And yes this was only avail for limited time so the deal is now over but at least you kind of get to see what the restaurant is all about.

It was my friend's birthday on the last week the deal on so we decided to give it a try. We arrived at 5pm on a Saturday and were first few people in the table.

This was a menu they were testing out that day, it had tomatoes, artichokes, crispy rice puffs and beets. It was a very refreshing dish and the orange vinegrette def gave it that citrus kick.

Following were all part of $35 bent-o box for 2

Oyster Sake Shot

* Lemongrass, shallots, ponzu marinated salmon roe
* I was looking forward to this but found it to be way too fishy for my likings

Lime Coconut Curry Shrimp Soup

* Tomato, corn, squash and crispy puff rice
* This was a creamy rich soup that I really enjoyed

Lobster Tacos

* Charred onion tomato salsa, lobster meat and avocado
* Filled with lots of lobster meat, it was one of our favorites from the box

Tuna Watermelon Ceviche

* Shaved red onion, cilantro, crispy shallots, citrus juice, chili and chinese doughnut fritter
* It was hard to tell the difference between red tuna and watermelon
* Another light sashimi dish that was good with sake

Pressed Octopus

* Perilla, black garlic, olive oil, lentil and tomato
* This I did not enjoy as much as I thought I would

Spicy Tuna Avocado Tartare

* One of the most familiar tasting dish our of the box
* Spicy tuna on top of deep fried rice ball

Spicy Peruvian Style Ceviche

* White snapper, clams, mussels, calamari, chili and lime juice
* There was so much seafood in this dish and the chili really brought out the flavor

Asian style Atlantic Salmon Gravlax

* Japanese omelette, horseradish lemon & chive creme fraiche topped with marinated salmon roe
* I liked the creme fraiche but not so much the omelette on the bottom

Apart from the food we were served, the restaurant itself is a piece of art to look at! Especially where we were seated, the walls were covered in these tiny collectibles and I felt like I was at some garage sale (in a good way of course).

Conclusion: Trying bent before Lee Restaurant (which has been on my list forever), now def convinced me that I need to drop by Lee Restaurant one day. Usually I am not a fan of fusion Asian food, but if it's done properly I know I will enjoy my meal. 
Unfortunately Bent-o box is no longer avail but I will def be back to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the most nondescript street - it was a hike to get there from the financial district but I'm glad we did. This was one of the best dinners I've had! We came in around 10 pm and the restaurant was still packed. There was a special (2 for $48) bento and we decided to go for that. We also ordered the crispy chicken dumplings as a starter. First we were served the chilled crab and shrimp shooter - this was refreshing with a kick of spice. You could taste the watermelon and there little bits of seafood in it. Our dumplings came fried with some chorizo on the side. Inside each pocket was a stuffing of meat and vegetables and they came with sauces - a Parmesan cheese sauce and a sweet and spicy sauce that were really good combined. We were then served the entire bento which contained the Blood Orange and Grapefruit Salad, Avocado Croquette with Miso Cured Salmon, Spring Vegetable Fritter, Japanese Style Tuna Tartar, Chicken and Shitake Rice Gnocchi, Susur's Jerk Quail, and Short Braised Short Rib Taco. The salad was my favorite dish - the citrus pieces were so good with the Parmesan cheese emulsion and I really appreciated the sweetness of the orange rinds and candies walnuts. The avocado and smoked salmon dish was my second favorite - this was a really well thought out dish texture-wise and taste. The spring vegetable fritter came with a spicy aioli and this was also very good and not too oily which I appreciated. The quail was delicious and spiceful as well as tender. The tacos were also good - the guacamole was a great addition. The gnocchi was something I've had before - it was stuffed with meat and came in good sauce wither a mushroom duxelle. The tuna tartare was the most simple dish - the other dishes were all fusions with other ethnic foods but the tartare was purely Japanese, no fusion. It was delicious and but plain. We ended with a banana chocolate cake and this was amazing! It came with a coconut tulle and a vanilla marshmallow. We killed this dish in seconds. The food was good, wait staff was very on point and attentive and the atmosphere was great. The bathrooms are a bit creepy but I really enjoyed my experience and would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Really unique and interesting place in terms of design, packed and hopping on a weekend night. Susur is always excellent, and this place doesn't disappoint. We ordered a lot of different tastes from the menu. The vale + tofu salad is fantastic, must try. Short ribs were very well done as well. Tuna & Salmon Tartare was decent, but not amazing. Overall this is a wonderful and unique spot just as most of Susur's restaurants are!"}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious last night. The food was amazing, the service was mediocre. I get that they were very busy, but when the server tries to take my drink away when it's still a third full, I get a bit annnoyed.

The food: everything was really tasty. A couple of favourite dishes were the Braised Beef in Peking Crepe and the Asian Duck Confit. It is confusing though when the server tells you everything is made for sharing, but it's really not served in such a way. The cod came as one piece on top of a rice cake with sauce on the bottom. The duck was a duck leg with the bone. It's really hard to share those things, especially when they come on huge plates that barely fit on the tables so you're doing a lot of reaching.

The service: As with my drink, another server tried to take one of the plates away when we weren't finished eating it! When you smile to a hostess when arriving and leaving and she doesn't smile back, it leaves a bit of a bad taste. I didn't think the service was good, so only left a 15% tip (on a $110 bill for two). Interestingly, as the previous reviewer said, this only made the server frown and walk away.

I would probably go back here because of the food, but only when I would expect them to be not too busy."}
{"text":"Our last dinner in Toronto was 5 stars!  Sister restaurant Lee was booked so we opted for Bent and we are so happy we did.  We had s tanks near the bar which was fun to watch bartender.  Our waiter was actually the manager and he was friendly and helpful and we enjoyed talking with him.  We had cocktails before dinner.  My husband had an oyster shooter which he enjoyed.  We started with the AWESOME slaw followed by yellow fin tuna dish which was delicious.  We also had the crumbled shrimp which we enjoyed with wonderful flavored.  Finished with a light dessert.  We enjoyed the atmosphere at Bent too!"}
{"text":"This place was okay. My general impression was that the food looks better than it tastes. Not that it tastes bad- in fact, everything tastes just fine- but doesn't live up to the presentation. 

I had the lobster tacos, tartare two ways, fried dumplings, and the tuna and watermelon ceviche. All of these dishes looked beautiful, and had good texture, but I found the taste unremarkable in all cases. I can't quite put my finger on what went wrong. Everything seemed to lack the punch you would expect from such intricately presented (and pricey) food. 

The highlight of my dish was my delicious Asian Caesar. This cocktail is worth its $16 price tag, since it was by far one of the most complex, savoury, delicious Caesars I've had in this city.

The atmosphere is very crowded and hip (not that there's anything wrong with that- it feels like a party), and the service was friendly and skilled. I'd come back for a drink."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Our waiter was so thoughtful - he combined an empty table beside us at the end of the night so we could eat more comfortably in the booth while sitting next to each other."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for my dad's birthday yesterday. We were seated right away but just next to the bar where servers were walking vigorously. I asked for a quiet table though. Its wad three of us and the menu was very.. VERY simple. 2 pages period. One the left side its their summerlicious menu, the right with their own signature dishes. 

We ordered one summerlicious menu and 4 of the regular dish. My dad didnt know the portions were small.. lol 

I read reviews from Yelpers that the Singaporean style slaw has a strong ginger taste. I was little worried since my dad doesnt like ginger. It was actually so tasty and ginger was not strong at all. 

We started with the slaw, pulled beef & braised onion peking crepe and lump crab taco.
Our server explained what ingredients the slaw had while she was digging up our salad. Yes she was actually digging our salad not mixing. She was spilling our dish to the table... then she came back with a cloth and cleaned her mess.. hmm

Then our main came after 20 mins when we were done with our appetizers. It was pretty surprising that they take away your dirty dishes and gives you a new one every time there was a term between our dishes. 

The mains were Ancient Grain & Forbidden Rice Risotto, South Indian Curry Marinated Rack of Lamb and Szechuan Style Garlic Shrimp with Bean Crumble. Risotto was nice and creamy, the lamb was super soft and tasty, and 4 pieces of huge shrimp dish. 

We were sooo full and pleased.
They also gave us a happy birthday dish with melted marshmellow and a candle. Thanks! 

Light meal would be perfect for the place but if you are hungry.. be ready with your money."}
{"text":"So this will probably only one of many reviews as this one will be based on the NYE 2015 set experience so to be fair I never had their normal menu.

We booked our reservation for 10:00pm on New Years Eve hoping we would get our food on time to celebrate for the countdown. Turns out it did not work out as planned.

We were seated on time and took awhile for the waiter to ask us if we wanted drinks. Given it was busy but it would usually be the first thing done within the first 5 mins of seating.

The menu was set so there wasn't much choice. It was set at $85 for the following (http://t.co/wBu2qfUhNO):

Amuse Bouche - Lobster Panna Cotta with Coconut Lemongrass Foam

French Salsifi Puff Pastry Tart - Puree of Apple, French Truffle

Assam Crab Salad with Avocado & Potatoes - Avocado, Baby Shrimp Thailandaise Lotus Root Chip

Coffee Marinated Bison - Foie Gras Marsala expresso Emulsion, Cranberry & Raspberry Jam, Swiss Cheese Rosti, Roasted Brussels Sprouts

French & Chinese Tong Yuen - Banana Blueberry Compote, Orange Creme Anglaise

All was delicious but I was hoping they would also sell some of the usual items from their normal menu. Especially their famous Singaporean Slaw. I get it is from his dad's restaurant Lee but I know they serve it here as well. 

Given that it was a NYE event, you would think they would notify us of the countdown. Turns out NO ONE was following the countdown and I had to wing it with my own watch. Once we manually counted down, only our table tapped glasses and then back to eating. It was pretty sad and not what I had expected for New Years.

Oh well lesson learned.

But overall the food was great, the staff could be better but I'll give it another chance when i go on a normal day.

Still recommended."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Susur Lee since the iron chef days on TV. I finally tried Bent during summerlicious of 2015. Booked reservations in advance and got seated right away. My friend and I got seated on the patio since all the seats inside were reserved. We both got the amazing watermelon and spicy tuna ceviche to start off with and was amazed at how delicious it was and the presentation was beautiful. It was spicy, sweet and savory at the same time with different textures. I was surprised to see chinese donuts sliced thin and fried which gave the salad a nice crunch and the watermelon was just refreshing. My friend got the fried jerk chicken which was good and again nicely plated and I got the caramelized miso black cod which I loved! The texture just melted in your mouth and was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The waitress also did a great job describing everything that came out in great detail. Lastly the trio dessert, it was light and refreshing and delicious!  I enjoyed every dish that came out and was full by the time I finished my dessert, although someone else having the same meal as me probably won't be full. I would probably order a few extra appetizers if you have a big appetite. I would definitely come here again  for a special occasion or if I feel like indulging."}
{"text":"i went last year but was not impressed by the food for the price point unfortunately. i perfer Lee's better. Will not return."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in toronto. The produce is always fresh and the flavours are so unique and exciting. I love their signature salad and all their sashimi. I had chicken there last night and it was the best chicken I've ever had. It was so juicy and the skin crisp. So devastated it's closing down but hopefully bigger and better things are to come"}
{"text":"Bent is my favourite restaurant for special occasions. I am a picky eater although I can certainly enjoy all types of food. I crave for the unexpected culinary experience and the most appealing part of Bent is that you never fully know what the things you order might taste like (obviously in a great way!). I ran into Susur Lee once during winterlicious and yes he was supervising his staffs and he did say hi to us. I like how frequently this place changes menu. What I can see in Bent is that deep apprenticeship roots in details and innovation comes from consistent refinement. 

Well, this place isn't cheap. However, compared to plenty of fine dining options in Toronto, I still think my money was well-spent."}
{"text":"A truly beautiful experience. Fresh food, well presented and balanced, with courteous servers."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed by a susur Lee restaurant. Everything from service to ambience to food was on point. 

We made reservations easily online in advance. Showed up and had to choose between all the amazing dishes. 

These dishes are small appetizers meant for sharing, there are also some mains. If you decide to go with a main, go with the lamb rack!! 

I went with my fiancé but if you have issues deciding what to choose, go with a group! That way you can try more. 

It's definitely a really good fusion of Asian cuisine, south or east. 

Will definitely return :)"}
{"text":"I love all of Susur Lee's establishments and am never disappointed by the food or service.

The Singaporean Slaw is definitely a must-try, but also be sure to try their lamb chops and scallops! They were so delicious, and each dish we had was paired with a unique purée that you have to have with the entree to appreciate. We tried a lot on the menu that I can't remember, but I do remember having room for dessert and being really impressed with their churros!

Although this isn't a place you go for a casual dinner, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner at Bent last night for my first time and was not impressed with the food or service.  We arrived right on time for our reservation during the late seating.  After being seated promptly our drink order was taken within five minutes. About five minutes after that a different waiter came by and took our food order (which was four share plates: kale salad, tuna watermelon ceviche, chicken dumplings and jerk chicken).

Less than five minutes after ordering our food, the kale salad came out.  Our drinks, including my friend's $15 cocktail still had not arrived. The timing of the events made it feel like: (1) the kale salad was not made to order for our table and: (2) that no one was watching over the table to at least hold the salad pending drink arrival.

About ten minutes later our second dish arrived (tuna watermelon ceviche), cocktails were still yet to be seen. Soon after our waiter came by to indicate he was sorry for delay in our drinks, he explained that the drinks were all made from scratch and many guests had arrived at the same time. The apology felt no way genuine, and the excuse not reasonable given that when we arrived no one else was waiting to be seated, in fact many guests were still finishing, eating dessert.  Further, I'm not aware of any such restaurant that would not make such drinks from scratch, this wasn't a Cancun mixer.  In any event, the cocktails arrived as we finished our second dish.  The tuna watermelon ceviche was by far the best dish, and in fact the only dish that was up to par for my expectations of a Susur restaurant.

The third and forth dishes came out (jerk chicken and chicken dumplings), both mediocre.  I normally love enjoying a coffee and dessert after the meal, but we could hardly hear each other, and although busy the vibe wasn't sexy on this particular Friday evening. I just wanted to leave as fast as I could.

The service was not friendly - the food was not worth the money or hype. I love great food and have no issue spending money on it - but this didn't make the cut. It was so mediocre, I would not go back."}
{"text":"This place is closing for good May 20th, 2017 so get there while you can.  Cool room and the food is good. Go with low expectations and I suspect you will leave happy."}
{"text":"Came here for a company dinner and ordered the chef's tasting menu. In terms of drinks, I began with a mojito (nothing special, tasted exactly like the mojito should, but I was too shy/scared to order the Asian Caesar), and the table finished by sharing a bottle of wine.

For appetizers, we started off with the Singaporean slaw. I can honestly say that this was my favourite dish of the night, complete with different textures (loved the taro, peanuts and carrots) and flavours (salty and sweet). Then came the oyster sake shots, which I found too salty. The beef carpaccio was next, which were quite unforgettable. Then the tuna tataki... which I would have enjoyed without the overwhelming sauce, but it was nevertheless okay.

For mains, we shared the tuna and watermelon ceviche, which was certainly interesting with the spicy mayo like sauce and sweet watermelon cubes. Fairly refreshing! There was also the lion head tempura, but I found the batter of the tofu slightly too thick. The scallops with sundried tomato crust were delicious and tasty! Then came the onion rings with mint chutney and yogurt, and I wasn't a fan of the sauce (I prefer things lighter in flavour). Finally, the long awaited lamb chops, and I absolutely loved the taste as well. Those banana fritters were scrumptious!

We finally ended with dessert, consisting of two items. One was similar to a Chinese tong yuan, chewy and rich in sesame flavour, with a nice kick of tangy fruit. The other was an unset creme brulee in a crispy dish like pastry, into which we poured some sweet apricot nectar.

Overall, the comments from my colleagues were that Lee's offers better food, though the two restaurants are highly similar."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*

I think it actually kind of freaky to see old dolls and trinkets lining the walls of Bent. My friends and I were seated in a prime and cozy corner towards the back of the restaurant, and I was staring at tiny Barbie-like dolls that looked like they would be coming alive from some horror movie...

In any event, I finally got to try Bent, after some hype about Brad Pitt eating there as well (I wonder if I sat in the same seat as him?!?!? *sigh*)

The menu is built for sharing - for a group of 5, the waiter suggested 8-10 dishes to share. On that note, we decided to order:

Tuna and Watermelon Ceviche - Refreshing, although I am not sure how you can go wrong with Tuna and Watermelon as these ingredients do not need any cooking.

Vegetable Quinoa - This was great, but again, simple. If I had to, I would order this dish again

Fried Chicken Dumplings - These were really good, although I almost felt jipped that I had to pay triple the price for something fried and, dare I say it, something one could get a China Buffet King (!)

Lamb - I am not a lamb person, but my friends said it was good. It looked like it was cooked a perfect medium (nice and pink) although no one wanted to eat the last piece

Short Ribs - Didn't get to try this as it was all gone! Clearly this was a winner

Lobster Tacos - Good, but nothing wow

Overall, I enjoyed my time here with friends, but the restaurant itself is forgettable. I like the atmosphere: dark, woodsy tones, chill. I also really, really love the idea of this restaurant being \"family run\" - a good opportunity for famous chef-dad (and super-designer mom) to show kids what the business is like and what it takes to succeed. Drinks menu are extensive and I like that they have a wide selection of both Wines and Sakes (although Sake bottles are expensive here. Our table decided to order a big bottle of Sake at $74 - the second cheapest option).

On the other hand, I don't like fusion-Asian cuisine because I like the real deal better. At times, I felt like I was eating Hype and Ambiance rather than Food taking central attention.

I would consider this a local-neighbourhood haunt which is another reason why I won't be back here anytime soon - it's just a little out of my ways.

Service - Professional 

FYI!

Reservations are a must. My friend, who booked for us, received the standard email that we would only be allowed to sit 2.5 hours and if we were late for more than 10 minutes, they would give our table to someone else. Well, on this Friday night, we sat way past our 2.5 hour allotment, and there were actually some tables still unseated."}
{"text":"Went for Valentine's Day prix fix in 2015. Amazing food but at 95$ per head plus wine and cocktails I definitely won't be running back any time soon... At least not if I'm footing the bill. Ended up visiting Bent again for a private Christmas party later in the year and when there was no cheque attached everything tasted even better! The truth is no one does seafood quite Susur."}
{"text":"Busy for a Wednesday so we had to wait at a nearby bar for 30 minutes before getting a call to return. Generally through out the night there was some slightly longer than normal waits but the service was superb through out and the staff really courteous.

The upstairs is pretty normal, the downstairs if you use the urinals is kind of freaky, having school pictures of young kids in the washroom. Get Rid!

There were four of us so we shared a bunch of starters. My favourite had to be the Lobster Tacos, they just tasted so refreshing. Also we tried the signature singaporean slaw but did not really impress me as much as the tacos and the spicy tuna ceviche.

For mains I went and ordered the south indian rack of lamb. The lamb itself was beautiful, done just right but did not really have anything south indian about it. That came more from the lentil stew and mint chutney. It was great but could have done without the banana fritters. Maybe that is a south indian thing but I didnt think much of them."}
{"text":"It was good but not great. We went for the tasting menu. Highlights and lowlights. Questionable value"}
{"text":"You can't miss this place, literally. It has a retro flashing arrow pointing to the restaurant from the outside.

Really enjoyed dining here. Going with a group of 4 is perfect for trying 7-9 sharing plates.

My choice for must-try dishes (in order):
1.  Spicy tuna and watermelon ceviche - everything on this plate complemented eachother perfectly. That sauce brought all the flavours and textures together. I could've drank it... Yum!
2.  Braised spiced shortribs - the tender meat, rich sauce, smooth pureed parsnips and yellow carrots made for a tasty meal
3.  Truffled Japanese carpaccio - love the use of the hickory stick like chips paired with the meat
4. Lobster ravioli (special feature) - the champagne bisque sauce should be on the menu as its own item it is that amazing
5. Lobster tacos - liked the shell (think it was taro or parsnip), thought the mango sauce nicely offset the heat of the chili
6. Sashimi tasting - you get to try 3 types of sashimi (2 pieces of each)
For dessert: Banana cake - the homemade jumbo toasted marshmallow and salted caramel sauce won me over

I do not recommend the pressed poached octopus.

Bonus: tons of street parking and good selection of sake

Diners beware: the portion are a bit small for the price and there is no beer on tap"}
{"text":"went on a tuesday evening. Lots of people. 

We ordered 4 plates for 2, the lobster tacos, the big special salad (19 ingredients salad or something like that), the crab curry, and the scallops. 

It was more then enough. By the end of the meal, neither myself or my wife had space for dessert. 

The lobter tacos wer very good, but we felt that the rest of the food was always a bit on the sweet side (asian fusion). I would have added a bit more spices in every dish, espcially the salad.

Overall was ok. I might return in the future and give it another try."}
{"text":"Disappointing! None of us (4 ppl total) will go back. Food was just a mix of awkward flavors that did not work at all. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Came here on friday for the summerlicious dinner.  Our reservation was for 8pm and we were promptly seated.  The restaurant was busy and super loud so we had to shout across the table to talk to each other.  

There were 3 of us and we shared the slaw - amongst the 3 of us.  It was okay.  It's my 2nd time having it.  This time the tuna sashimi is fresher than the salmon sashimi I had at Lee.

The watermelon and tuna ceviche was good - it has a slight kick to it.

The cod was delicious!  The portions were small and I felt like it was slightly tastier at Lee (it was perfectly cooked there).

The trio of desserts was so so - I didn't even finish it.

We shared a bottle of wine and the bill ended up being $100.

The service was just so so... The waiter spilled slaw on the floor when he was mixing it and we had to ask for utensils between courses."}
{"text":"Susur Lee is a Jedi....and I love him.

The restaurant itself looks great. Beautiful decor (thank you Brenda Bent - wife of Susur) and the staff are very friendly and knowledgeable.

We had the bento box starter as an appetizer. It's a huge bento box with pickles, oyster shooters, little lobster tacos in crispy shells, tuna and watermelon ceviche served on top of a Chinese donut fritter. There's also pressed octopus with Mediterranean influences of pomegranates and lentils, a spicy white snapper, clam, mussel, and calamari ceviche with Peruvian chili, and salmon gravlax on a Japanese omelet.

The Bento Box great. Everything tasted so fresh and clean.  I kept moaning with pleasure with each and every bite, so much so that I think the couple beside thought I was in one of those Herbal Essences commercials. You know the ones I'm talking about.... where the woman in the shower sounds like she's having the Big O...? 

After the Bento Box we had the kale and tofu salad - another big hit - and because I'm a fat-bastard, we also had the braised spiced short ribs. Mmmmmm. 

So 
Effing 
Good

As I said before, Susur Lee is a Jedi...and I love him.
I will hold him personally responsible for my increasing waistline.

{"text":"Admittedly, this review has been sitting in queue for so long that I actually forget all the delicious things we had the last time I was here. Points I do recall:

- Owned and operated by Toronto Top Chef Susur Lee
- A cool modern looking space that was both eye catching and alluring
- Friendly staff, and an accommodating kitchen for our large (20+ group)
- They have a great cocktail list
- Every... and I mean every item we had on our sampler menu was exquisite!

I wish this review was more helpful, however, what I will say is that my experience overall was extremely enjoyable at Bent, and I will return to update this review in the near future with plenty of mouth watering details!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience there with a large group on a set menu - as expected from Susur, the food was impeccably on point. The restaurant feels quite small compared to Lees and Luckee, which makes the setting far more intimate - we even saw and talked to Susur as he walked around the restaurant occasionally speaking to guests.

My favourite dish was the tuna carpaccio - so delicious, and beautiful presentation.

I have to say that almost approaching the level of food was the level of service - the wait staff were anticipatory, conscientious and accommodating - everything that you would want and expect at a restaurant like this. We were a difficult group with unusual requests, and they easily handled by the staff, making for a smooth night of celebration."}
{"text":"I went to Bent last night for Summerlicious. Normally Asian fusion is not a restaurant descriptor that catches my attention, but a friend had heard good things.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous and the service was impeccable. 

The food was great, and one of the better Summerlicious menus I have experienced. For starters my group shared the shrimp tacos and the chicken dumplings. The tacos were the clear winner here. And best of all, though I have to admit I didn't believe our server when she said we could share the starters, they were really generous portions (i.e. she was right!). We each got one of the mains. I really loved my salmon with the sweet citrusy flavours cut with ginger. The dessert trio was equally impressive and bursting with summer flavours, apart from the profiterole which was a bit of a letdown. The milk-chocolate sauce just didn't have enough oomph against the pastry and cream.

The only thing I have left to comment on are the cocktails. I am torn, because...they were delicious. I had the thyme-prosecco-gin mojito and it was one of the best cocktails I have ever had. And it was priced accordingly: $16. I had two of those, and so my bar tab was almost equal to my Summerlicious tab."}
{"text":"I was a walk in customer and wasn't aware this restaurant was of the Lee brand so I had no expectations going in. I found the ceviche fishy and the calamari intransigently chewy and overdone. Flavour profile was a bit too adventurous for me at points. Overall a good experience but better meals to be had in the city for the same price."}
{"text":"I went with my BFF to try out Bent. When we arrived at 6pm on a Wednesday, there was plenty of space.. by 6:30 however, the place was rammed. Being a new restaurant, I figured I would break down the details:

ATMOSPHERE
- I personally love the feel of Bent. The trinkets on the wall remind me of my youth. The white tiles are sleek and give an overall clean feeling and the wood tables are beautiful. 

SUPPORT
- The wait staff was fantastic. They suggested dishes to try and were always on top of making sure you were never waiting for anything, not matter how busy. When we had a random question (about them being on twitter), the guy went away and came back within minutes with an answer.

FOOD
-The BEST part of the experience was the food. We tried the Oysters, the cheese and orange pastry, the duck confit salad, the short ribs and the chicken dumplings.. all of which were so delicious. I'm definitely going to try the tacos next time I'm there. MY FAV dish was the duct confit salad... Oh and they let us sample some desserts.. I highly recommend getting the asian donut... yum

THE PRICE
I think the price is quite reasonable and within the ballpark of Susur's other restaurants. For two people, 5 dishes and 2 x drinks a piece, it cost us each $80 with tax and tip.


Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Dinner at Bent was good but wasn't the best. I give it a solid 3.5 for slightly above average quality meal. 
The ceviche dish was definitely the best but the other items I tried were just so-so. Especially the peruvian seafood tartare thing was a bit too much in flavours- a bit too citric and too saucy. 
The lobster taco was outstanding and so was the tuna ceviche with watermelons. 
I would go back if I was in the neighborhood to try a few more things."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious last week and it definitely did not disappoint. It was a struggle to get a reservation and the earliest time was 815. We had to park a bit far as the area is a little hectic but it was a nice day so I didn't mind. My advice would be to get here a bit before your reservation. It was extremely loud in here and I wished we could have sat outside. It's much less formal looking than Lee but still great service. We ordered off the summerlicious menu but also got an appetizer to share. 

To start I had the fried jerk chicken with coleslaw. Two big pieces of chicken seasoned so well. It didn't taste like West Indian jerk chicken but it was still amazing. I hate coleslaw but this one went so well with it. We also shared the duck confit and goat cheese spring rolls. I am not a duck fan but it complimented each other so well and had a yummy sauce and slaw that went with it.

For the main we both got the striploin steak with beef agnolotti. It was really yummy but I don't usually eat my beef medium rare and wished they offered to cook it a bit more. It was still good just a bit too pink and chewy. The braised beef agnolotti was heaven. I could have eaten tons of those. It had a Caribbean taste to it. 

For dessert it was meh. I really enjoyed the mango panna cotta. Perfect texture and not overly sweet. Didn't really like the chocolate mousse which I was sad about. I didn't like the jackfruit spring roll much as it was a bit sweet and hard to eat. 

Overall it was a great time. The washroom is freaky as they have pics of kids from the 70s or 80s up. No idea why and the washroom won't lock. We saw susur lees son which was very cool. Definitely would come back"}
{"text":"Bent is a  nice, casual, bar. Nothing fancy, but does the job. The atmosphere is very chill and open which I like. Bartenders were very friendly and  conversational  making it feel like a very nice atmosphere. It's a little pricey but worth checking out when in the hood. It fits in nicely with the vibe of the area!"}
{"text":"I came here on Friday with some friends. The restaurant is on the smaller side and cozy with a good amount of space between the tables and eclectic decor. There is a glass case full of mini figurines as well as school photos lining the bathroom walls. 

My friend and I split the seafood appetizer special. it was like $44 ish. (before tax and tip)  It came with oyster shooters. tuna watermelon ceviche, and 4 other small dishes of fresh well seasoned seafood. Each was delicious, and I recommend this Bento for a seafood lover. 

we also had the baba ganoush which was delicious. 

I had a gin sour - a perfect cocktail.

They brought is a few small deserts: a chocolate banana dish, a strawberry sour pudding thing, a flan... non were exceptional, also we were pretty full from the meal. 

The service was prompt, and our server gave helpful suggestions of things to order. I highly recommend Bent, and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing dissapointment of a restaurant.  Food was mediocre at best, drinks were over priced (which is to be expected) and took too long to arrive.  My favorite part was that upon arrival Su Sur Lee arrived at our table making us feel very special.  He then bestowed us the honor of choosing our courses.  Felt very contrived to me, felt like a money grab.  We felt it would be rude to say no to such a regarded chef.  However, upon agreeing to have him choose we didn't see him again for the rest of the evening. Felt very much that he used his celebrity to over charge us.  Bottom line I left hungry and poor!"}
{"text":"A friend and myself were at Bent last night. Dinner was delicious until my second bite of the jerk chicken. When I realized I was chewing on raw chicken; I spit it out on my plate my half portion of cod I was sharing with my friend. I was so disgusted that I had asked the server to take away my entire plate. We were soon served another plate of chicken that was cooked properly. So we were then given complementary mocktails. I would assume to smooth over the issue that I just chewed on raw chicken. Being a healthcare provider I know that the slightest contamination could cause salmonella and I actually was chewing on raw chicken. It is beyond me that not even one of our meal and in fact the entire meal should have been complimentary. This is also disappointing to me that my experience has been equated to customers that had to wait 30 minutes for drink orders and were given complimentary drinks (read from another Yelp review). Salmonella could kill me and waiting 30min for a drink order will not. Manager didn't even offer an apology. 

Thanks for minimizing the seriousness of my experience."}
{"text":"Even if the only dish on the menu was the Tuna Watermelon Ceviche and they only served water, I would give Bent 5 stars.

My favourite restaurant experience of 2013"}
{"text":"Another one of Chef Susur's restaurants that didn't disappoint.
The concept of the food is to be more small portions good for sharing. The food was on point, nothing I ate that night I can say was less than good.

The decor was nice and had an asian feel but definitely with western influence. The location is great and is an awesome addition to the Bathurst/Dundas area.

The service was great and attentive. Servers always explained the dishes and cleared plates quickly.

The price is pricy but it's worth what you're paying for. A good place to impress."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night. Glad I made reservations because it was packed! Very cool atmosphere, this place is extremely trendy and popular which is attributed to the owner being a celebrity chef. 

Nonetheless, the food and experience was great! We had the lobster tacos (yum), oysters (fresh), lamb (delicious). The drinks are equally as good, I had an old fashion with a chocolate twist to it, that I really liked.   My wife had a spicy Cesar, that she too enjoyed. Service is great and attentive, our server was very friendly, funny and helpful! The servers who bring the food out are at times over enthusiastic when the present the entrées, too much at instances, but not a game breaker, better than having someone who doesn't care to be there. Other than that the restaurant is a bit pricey but it's expected given the popularity of the place. 

Definitely will go back for more!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal there last night with 2 girl friends. The lime coconut shrimp soup was amazing followed by the short ribs x2 and duck x1. The service was exce lent. The only complaint was that after 2 hours we were kicked out for another seeing. Will go again for sure!"}
{"text":"Being the 100th review, I'll keep it relatively short, sweet and celebratory. 

+the signature slaw will more than meet your expectations. This is much better than I remember the slaw being at Lee way back when.
+I vote yes on the duck goat cheese spring roll divide. 
+the scallops from the kitchen section were gorgeous. The tantalizing description on the menu did not disappoint. 
+elder goose cocktail - HELL YES.
+we were celebrating a good friend's 30th birthday and they went all out with a decorative sign, candle and beautiful dessert of french liquorice meringue with lemon curd plus chantilly cream, sesame brittle, passionfruit syrup and raspberry coulis. Celebrating the wonderful birthday lady with such a divine dessert was a highlight of the meal.

There were only a couple of negative points:

-somewhat scattered service, it's a bit chaotic. 
-the volume of this place is loud. It can get to the point of having to yell which isn't pleasant at all. 
-I personally enjoyed the wild albacore tuna white pepper tatami, but it wasn't an overall hit at the table (the flavours may be a bit overpowering for some).

Bent deserves it's lucky number 7 (times 3!) address on Dundas West."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! Singaporean slaw (19 ingredients) was impeccable... Almost too gorgeous to eat.  I ordered the mushroom dish as part of Summerlicious, while the other 3 diners I was with ordered the jerk chicken dish and the cod for their mains.  I was quite dissapointed with the mushroom dish, so much so that I refused to eat it and told the waiter it was not what I had expected.  Without hesitation, he changed my order no questions asked and brought me the caramelized cod.  Wow, what a treat! That's what great service is all about.  Loved the atmosphere, and basically everything about this place.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Bent has a menu that is trying to offer every food trend under the sun. The food is okay but you decide for yourself; lobster tacos, watermelon tuna ceviche, curried dish, jerk chicken,chinese fusion dishes etc.
The ever so popular line of \"Sharing plates\" is used here as well and the portion sizes are small. 
No bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Come here on Friday of opening week. Came with the intention to wait at a near-by bar knowing their no reservation policy. Everything worked out better than expected and was seated in under 30 mins. The food from the raw bar was delicious. Everything we got, we loved. Tartare on fried rice cake patties is pretty much a higher end take on sushi pizzas you can get at an average sushi restaurant. The nigiri sampler was amazing. Deliciously seasoned sushi rice. The hot food was alright tho the braised short ribs was a definite winner in my books. The cocktails are heavily gin based if that's your thing. Can't wait to go back tho it's pricey enough that I can't go back weekly."}
{"text":"This place is good, not great. It is expensive although the ambience is cool and hip, and the service is respectable. The menu features a lot of raw food so if that is what your palate is craving, this is the place to be. The first time I went was a better experience as susur lee was running the kitchen, the next time I came with a group, they were not impressed with the food. Prepare to order a lot of food if your hungry, every dish is to share"}
{"text":"Bent is a special treat for me, great modern fusion food and a nice atmosphere.  There's generally also street parking in the area if you circle around!  The stand out is definitely the Singapore Slaw, the recipe is available (Susur Lee released it!) BUT the 19 ingredients are staggering and with all that effort, you might as well make a trip to the restaurant.  Bent is truly a gem in the Toronto dining scene."}
{"text":"Second time to visit Bent after quite a while and it is still of good quality.

The Singaporean salad is brilliant with different textures, and tastes, recommended.
The beans and polenta croquette was nothing special.
The crab taco was tasty but four very small pieces.
The vegetarian risotto, an excellent blend of homely tastes, was superb.
The shrimp were spicy with good accompaniment, quite pricey for what they are.

The service was excellent, and informed.

On Tuesdays, they have a list of wines which they are prepared to offer at half price, most of the whites were sweet but there was a very good Pinot Noir from the states. Certainly worthwhile taking advantage of this.

The have quite a large patio which borders a side street and is good at this time of year."}
{"text":"Enjoyed every meal I've ever had here.  

I've done the Alacarte (repeatedly), the seafood tasting menu and a private party here and they never fail to disappoint.

Not to be missed - the Watermelon cevice and the short rib.

I prefer the crowd at Bent when compared to the more pretentious crowd at Lee."}
{"text":"What happened.... .? This was such an outstanding restaurant wherein everything was delicious. The menu has changed with less Asian fusion, more cheese. What's with the cheese? This was our favourite go to spot but after 2 lousy meals and mediocre service( that used to be great too) it's hard to go back again. Maybe Mr Lee is too busy with other restaurants to give Bent the love and attention it deserves. What a shame:("}
{"text":"Every plate had great flavour and thought put into it, but the one downer was that the alcohol was very expensive.  I was going to give 3 stars because of the price of the alcohol, but the review should be about the taste of the food, not the price of the wine.  So 4 stars I will give!

We got the tasting menu which was absolutely delicious, but we spent an equal amount on wine and mixed drinks...and I was still hungry after dinner.  But each dish had so much flavour and care that the fact that I was not full did not disappoint me.   My favourite plate was the blackend tuna, absolutely delicious.  The Asian Caesar was so flavourful as well, loved it. There was a bit of a pause between the starter plates and the main dinner plate, and then another pause before dessert.  I wasn't sure if that was because they were getting swamped or if it was on purpose, but it did increase my hunger.   If I go back, I will go back with my non-drinking friends and will eat more!"}
{"text":"The singapore slaw was similar to Lee's. Was very yummy and highly recommend it as a starter. Everything we ordered was super yummy - beef tacos, tuna and watermelon ceviche, beef carpaccio, wild mushroom quinoa rissotto, duck confit and goat cheese spring roll, and for dessert the warm banana chocolate chip cake was delicious! Would love to come back to try all other dishes because it seems like nothing made here can be dissappointing! Actually saw Susur Lee at the end of the night...that was exciting!"}
{"text":"Had the tasting menu bento box, which is cheaper before 7pm.  Unusual combinations tasted wonderfully together.  Lobster and shrimp tacos; pressed octopus in balsamic vinegar; this amazing tuna and watermelon cerviche.  So good.  Nice ambiance.  Service a bit slow, but manageable.  The waiter recommended a main dish to share along with the tasting menu which is a good idea as the bento box is a bit small, but flavourful!"}
{"text":"Went on Friday the 10th at 9 PM, with a lot of apprehension. It was because our last visit at Susur circa 2005 was not so pleasant and memorable. We went there with a lot of enthusiasm to buy Lee's book and hope to see him. He did walk around the tables and went to all except ours. The food then was expensive and inadequate. We did not buy the book and left unsatiated. We then refrained from going to any Lee restaurant perceiving that he may be arrogant and does not deserve our money (whatever we have).

However the visit time was outstanding and rewarding from the point of reservation till we left. 

Parking was a challenge, and after circling several blocks just magically found a spot so close that I could even see the car from where we sat.

Wife went in first and felt that the table assigned under the bar/kitchen counter was a bit tight.. The server went out of the way and accommodated her on a table near the window and also added a table to enlarge the space. It was a heart winning start!

We ordered, a featured seafood ceviche, grilled octopus, lump crab tacos, and spiced braised beef. Each meal was a treat to look at, taco shell light and crisp, seafood ceviche better than any ceviche that we ever tried in toronto, both the octopus and beef melted like butter. 

Each dish tasted totally different than the other leaving a back taste so delicious that one did not want to touch the other meal lest the taste of the other was lost. However all the tastes worked like a symphony of gastronomy that will remain resonating till our next visit.

The crown jewel of the evening of was the Pani Puri dessert built as an oxymoron of the real Indian Paani Puri that is always sharp , spicy,  and sour.  To conceive it as a dessert and then to sublimate it is the proof a  master. 

Service was outstanding and the table was in the sight of serving team who worked in unison, filling water very frequently, cleaning the table between servings, and changing plates and cutlery without even asking. Each dish was perfectly explained  and all questions responded with empathy.

They say that Lee make a round of this place occasionally. We hope that he will stop at our table next time and we will get the book signed even after such long time. 

Will be there soon!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I cannot comment on the food.

I am hoping that since Susar Lee is in charge of the menu and overseeing the restaurant the food is at least decent. However I don't think i will ever go back. 

On a Friday night we arrived at prime dinner time and got a table for 6, and were asked to wait for an hour. Which is very reasonable. 

An hour later we went back only to be told that they unfortunately cannot seat us as there is a party going on and it was out of their control, and that if we wanted to wait for another hour and a half, perhaps we can get a table. 
So they failed to estimate the waiting time for an hour and a half? This is your job, ms hostess! Not to include that you do have our contact number. It's a restaurant, people do have parties. 

'We don't do reservations so we can't kick people out.'

'You can go and talk to the party if you want.' 

'You can go to another restaurant if you'd like, I don't mind.' 


Yes. Those were her exact words. Very unapologetic. 
I will not be returning."}
{"text":"**3-1/2 stars**

It's so good to have Twitter foodie friends because they lead to all sorts of yummy places.  After having seen View the Vibe's photos of the Seafood Bent-o Box for 2 at BENT - the restaurant moved right to the top of my to-try list.   Oh, and to make it all that much more enticing - it's $35 for 2 (before 7pm, or $42 from 7pm onwards).  Top that Summerlicious!

BENT, is a family-owned business and the patriarch of said family is none other than celebrity chef Susur Lee.  The restaurant is named after Lee's wife, Brenda Bent and the kids are running the show.

I can only assume that the decor consists of Kai and Levi Bent-Lee's childhood toys (with an array of figurines neatly displayed on the back wall - the way an obsessive collector would display them).  Behind the bar you'll find some vintage Pachinko machines.

The atmosphere is reminiscent of a cafeteria (with conversation abuzz and wooden benches and orange/yellow chairs for seating).  You also get an infusion of old school diner thrown into the mix with bulb-lined mirrors and mosaic-tiled floors.

BENT is what I would dub a raw bar or fusion seafood restaurant with a heavy focus on sashimi, and a well-stocked selection of sake to go with.  For those who prefer their food cooked, look no further than the Hot Kitchen section of the menu.

The Seafood Bent-o was just the kind of light and refreshing meal I wanted on a humid day such as yesterday.

My favourites by far were the Oyster Sake Shot (top centre) and Spicy Tuna with Avocado Tartare (second row, left) served sushi-style on a delicious crispy rice cake.  The Tuna-Watermelon Ceviche (top right) was the most interesting in terms of complexity as you had spicy, fatty tuna that was balanced out with cool, refreshing watermelon.

The entire Bent-o box was plenty for 2, though we did opt for the Duck Salad Wraps ($18) because I absolutely love duck. While I applaud the creativity (e.g. Susur's signature Asian slaw and creamy foie gras pâté) as components of the filling, I found that the duck breast and confit itself was seriously lacking any real duck flavour.  If there was any, the tangy Asian slaw was a good cover-up though the foie gras saves the show and it is here that we taste the real duck flavour.

Dinner ends in true Chinese restaurant fashion with complementary desserts - but instead of the usual sweet red bean soup we get surprised with a Mango Pana Cotta topped with tapioca rice pudding and a Strawberry Rhubarb and Lemon Curd Parfait with hints of mint.  A refreshing and divine way to end the evening (especially with a cup of Americano).

I really enjoyed my meal at BENT.  The food was creative without trying too hard, and the flavours were amazing.  It is a fun place to dine, but I wouldn't order too many drinks (at $17 a cocktail I'd rather order another dish).  The service is friendly and attentive (at least until it comes time to pay your bill).  The total for 2 net of tip was $105, which includes 2 cocktails and 2 Americanos.

Due to its popularity, BENT has extended their Seafood Bent-o promotion until Saturday, June 8.  Better get on the phone fast, as reservations are booking up fast!

{"text":"Late entry : The time between arrival and our first drink for a table of 4 was 30 minutes...our first course was served at the 90 minute mark...this fantastic service came from a comment by the wait staff regarding an allergy alert. The staff said \"...you may as well go to another restaurant, most of our items are premixed or made and can be made to order to accommodate you...\" This approach was definitely preferred to any suggestions by the wait staff regarding \"safe\", fresh food choices on the menu"}
{"text":"OMG! Amazing food!  Cozy, quaint and super friendly staff. Full disclosure, I was invited by business partners so I didn't pay, nor did I see the prices, therefore I'm not going to judge on value for the money. 

That being said, we started with the Susur signature Singaporean style slaw, a salad that easily had 15 or so ingredients and was light and crisp with a delicious vinaigrette. 

The second course was a black pepper charred salmon with a vinegar sauce and cut to perfection. 

Following was a watermelon and spicy tuna ceviche to die for. 

A fourth course of Szechwan style garlic bean crumble prawns with chili sauce, probably my favorite dish of all!

Then on to Caramelized Black cod - absolutely flawless!

We also had the Chickpea tempura tofu... Amazing!

Then braised spiced short ribs, they were good, but didn't come close to the rest of the meal. 

Desert was the signature Tong Yiun and Indian pastry that ended a perfect dinner on a light and beautiful sweet note. 

Overall, one of the best meals I've ever had. I'm now, and forever more BENT!!"}
{"text":"We had a spectacular time here.  It was totally worth the price and wait

It seems that this place is always booked way in as advance and we couldn't get an early seating

They had a vegetarian theme that's like an Asian fusion style  going on the night we were there and it was so amazing. I usually don't like cilantro in my food but the food was so good that I didn't mind spending time to pick out the little leaves. 

Although the servings look small we actually got quite full before the main course

Sad to hear that it's closing though...don't know why..."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, pretty restaurant- nice energy. Food was good- especially liked the tacos and the scallops. The seviche was  too tart for my taste and not as flavourful as I would have liked. Why only three stars you ask? The service was dreadful. Dishes came out all at one and were not paced. They can put in an order that did not make sense- tart seviche after savoury tacos for example. They came by every ten minutes to fill up our already full wine glasses and  I felt so pressured to leave. Our server never checked in on us and was viably disinterested. I would not return."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious!!  Everything was amazing but the prices could definitely be improved!

Amongst the four of us we had three drinks and about 6 dishes (crab tacos, Singapore slaw, pan seared gnocchi, watermelon ceviche, garlic shrimp, braised beef) plus 2 desserts and coffee for all.

The crab tacos were amazing! Super flavorful and very different!

The Singapore slaw alone will bring me back!! Very generous portion!!!

The pine nut Gnocchi was beyond tasty and flavorful! Very small portion though!

The watermelon ceviche was sweet and spicy! Delicious! But I think the raw tuna gave me an upset tummy! 

The garlic shrimp was beyond yummy but very very overpriced! 

The Indian style braised beef was very tender and tasty but again a small portion.

The mousse dessert was amazingggggg with the fresh figs!!!! And the latte was nice too but a small serving.

Everything is a teeny tiny mini portion! When You're paying approx $20-40 per item, you better believe it's gonna be damn good with a heaping portion! 

We walked out of there full but by no means stuffed or even close to that! The saving grace was that the food was beyond tasty!  

For 4 people to pay a total of $320 seems like a ripoff to me!  We expected to pay $100 for 2 but we're blown with prices such as these, we may never be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible meal at bent! You have to try the slaw it may be one of the best things I have eaten. The flavours are very complex but meld together deliciously. All of the food was scrumptious. The ambiance and decor is also lovely. The service was couldn't be better. All in all a very memorable meal."}
{"text":"Finally got to try out Bent during Winterlicious. My friend was only able to get the 5:30pm reservation. The place was full by 5:45. I've always been hesitant with Asian fusion but have heard a lot of good things about Bent.

Our main server was good, though he acted like a salesman when going though the dishes. He indicated that the portion size of the dishes on the Winterlicious menu were smaller and suggested that we can order from the regular menu (on top of the Winterlicious menu). He then told us that the dishes were meant to be shared and recommended that we each order different apps and entrées. I saw the sizes of the dishes at the other tables and the plating was your standard Western style plating and individual size. Definitely not meant for sharing. My friends and I decided not to listen to the waiter and ordered the same dishes.


Sur Sur Singaporean Slaw (regular menu) - this is Sur Sur Lee's signature dish that is served at all of his restaurant and has 16+ ingredients. Must say, it's one of the best salads I've ever had. The sauce was light and flavourful and all of the ingredients blended well together. I love the taro chips that were piled on top of the slaw. One of the waiter came to our table to personally toss and serve the slaw. 

Winterlicious menu:

PAN ROASTED BRAISED BEEF IN PEKING CREPE
smoked tomato sauce, cotija, roasted cauliflower, chimichurri 
      The 'crêpe' is a cross between a crêpe and a dumpling and was nice and crispy. The beef filling with the chimichurri was rich and I love the cotija cheese that gave the dish an added dimension.

ASIAN DUCK CONFIT
cranberries & ginger relish, rutabega & apple potato rosti, crispy taro threads, roasted brussel sprouts with chorizo 
    The duck confit was cooked to perfection with a juicy and tender meat. I have to say that the rutabega & apple potato rosti was beyond delicious! It was seared, so it's outer shell was nice and crispy. The rutabaga gave the rosti a hint of sweetness. Only thing I didn't enjoy was the sauce. I felt it was too sweet, thick and over powered the other ingredients.

DESSERT TRIO (we gelot all three desserts in sample sizes... Which was great since it allowed us to sample and enjoy each dessert)
   
FEUILLATINE CARROT CAKE 
with orange lemon cream cheese fondant
  This was a lovely moist carrot cake with a hint of orange zest in the cream cheese fondant. I wished it wasn't a sample size

FRENCH & CHINESE TONG YUEN(vegetarian)
chocolate nougat, coconut, milk chocolate sauce, chocolate crumble, raspberry, apricot puree
and
    Dark chocolate and tong yuen do not go together! The dark chocolate was simply too much and overpowered the tong yuen for me. 

Passion fruit parfait (not sure what this dessert was called) 
   Passion fruit jelly juice with some kind of creme. I always find anything with passion fruit is refreshing, and this is no exception. I enjoyed the *explosion* of the passion fruit seeds with every bite.

I definitely enjoyed my dining experience at Bent, and would recommend the restaurant. Food and services were great for Winterlicious."}
{"text":"In Toronto on business - saw this place on Bizarre Foods America and thought it sounded interesting. The area where the restaurant is located seemed a little sketchy to me, but the food totally made the journey worth it. Thai Curry Shrimp soup was out of this world - I almost ordered a second bowl. Spicy Tuna ceviche and the truffled carpaccio were also phenomenal. We also ordered the crispy chicken dumplings with chorizo - would say that the star of this dish is really the chorizo. Portion size was good - definitely recommend sharing."}
{"text":"Excellent service at Bent. Our server was very knowledgeable about both sake and seafood. 

The food was great but at times awkward to eat (spoonfuls of ceviche and fall-apart fish tacos). Our table was rather small and was a bit too close to the hostess' podium but was by the window, hence it made up for location through its people watching abilities. The darker part of the restaurant closer to the bar looked more alluring. Nevertheless, I am a fan due to the high quality of food (fresh fish) and unique bathrooms (complete with pictures of toddlers). The space is beautiful. There is half-price wine & sake on Tuesdays. 

Apparently, Bent's patio is amazing during the summer so I think I'll come back then."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try it. Winterlicious menu was on, but we made sure to order a la carte for a more real experience. Food was good. Flavours are plentiful and the overall experience was satisfying, though found the tuna ceviche overly sweetened, and some of the apps hard to handle. Enjoyed the atmo. Would go back."}
{"text":"Keeping in mind that this is meant to be a top restaurant, I was impressed at the service but disappointed in the food itself. Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but not worth the hefty price tag per dish. I came for a holiday office party so we had the entire restaurant booked for the night and, thankfully, I didn't have to pay.

Beginning with the location, it's best to drive here. There's street parking right in front (but the meter ate my money and didn't give me a ticket!), so I parked along the side streets. The side streets are free but it's hard to find parking. If you're traveling by subway, you have to take a streetcar from St Patrick station. The restaurant itself is very small - probably large enough for 60 people comfortably.

There's a full bar with a fusion of unique drinks. They even offered a ton of suggestions for non-alcoholic drinks for me since I was driving. It was a fixed menu that night, but I asked the waiter for a vegetarian option and he was happy to whip something up for me. Staff was very friendly and explained each dish before placing it on the table. I even had to swap one of my veggie dishes because it had peanuts which I'm allergic to, and they were very polite about it.

We had their Singapore-style coleslaw (amazing!), and I had the pine nut gnocchi which was also very tasty. Portions are very small though! At $30 a plate, you would expect a little more. For dessert I had something very similar to an apple pie (I forget the exact name of it). Very delicious dessert, but definitely more on the sour side!

If you're looking for a more expensive place to go for a nice dinner, definitely come here and try the coleslaw! I did still leave hungry, but I felt very well cared for by the staff at Bent."}
{"text":"Great food. Service was slow. We were a party of 10 and it took 3 hours to eat. Way too much waiting between dishes. The mojito's  were made different every time we ordered one. Staff was friendly and we were all happy with the food. We usually go to Lee's...thought  we would try this place out for a change. We all had fun! The beef tacos were awsome!"}
{"text":"I must admit this is my first foray into Susur Lee's restaurants but after this experience, it will not be my last. I have been eyeing Bent for some time but I guess I just needed a get together with work friends to make it happen.

The restaurant is chic but eclectic at the same time. Old school photos and collections of nicknacks are interspersed with lacquered wooden chairs and tables and white walls. The restaurant is currently festively decorated with pumpkins which coordinates well with the orange cushions on the chairs.

Now for the food. Friends and I shared the signature Singapore Slaw. This salad was incredible! Composed of 19 ingredients, the flavours were complex and balanced. It is a salad that I would happily pay $25 for (additional cost if you add protein), as it has so many ingredients and clearly takes time to make. I also ordered the pan seared gnocchi with mushrooms and garlic which was also tremendously delicious. Despite my amazing meal, I longingly coveted the dishes shared by a portion of our group, who ordered the braised beef (incredibly tender and melt in your mouth), the black cod, and the gnocchi. This is really the intention of the restaurant, for several dishes to be ordered and shared tapas style.

Food prices are not inexpensive but you really get what you pay for. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and plan to go again to Bent soon with my
Hubby to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Very nice decor and great food

So much has been said about Susur and if anything his name is what I associate with Asian fusion in the Toronto area if not all of Canada

Service is very polished and at times invisible

My wife asked what sake do you recommend?  Blah blah blah....it turns out the $130 bottle....not nice.....it came out to like $20 a sip.....

One thing that was a great idea was that if the dish had 4 items then they can do up a extra serving to serve our table of five

My favs were the oyster sake shooter served in a nice little wooden sake cup

The slaw of course is a must as it is a classic dish that has survived

The best way to enjoy the meal is to order multiple plates and share among your friends

The tacos were awesome but I would skip the lamb unless you like it raw then of course it would be perfect

The rose water dessert was very nicely presented it the don't price it on the menu so expect a sticker shock

Overall, a wonderful space for dinner with a great menu but do not listen to the waiter on sake recommendations because really no one has $130 sake...but he does get a easy $20 tip of that bottle so now it cost $150"}
{"text":"We heard about Susur Lee, and we thought why not do Bent for summerlicious.

summerlicious menu was not all that impressive, small portions, not particularly memorable. for the party of four, we got two summerlicious and several other items off the regular menu. The regular menu items were fairly good - the Singapore slaw and the seafood tacos were quite yum. The food is decent, the price tag is quite crazy - I don't know if I'd come back again but it was worth the visit once.

get stuff from the regular menu!"}
{"text":"Came here spontaneously without reservation for dinner last Friday night and was seated almost immediately at a nice corner booth. Bent is one of Susur Lee's Toronto babies and it did not disappoint!

Do yourself a favor and order Susur's signature Singaporean-style slaw. It's very fresh and healthy, has 19 different ingredients, and very filling despite being a \"salad,\" probably because of the peanuts. You can also add sashimi slices on the side for extra protein. And for $25, this dish can feed 4-6 people. As vegetarians, we also ordered the chickpea tempura tofu lion-head ($15) and the handmade gnocchi ($28). Tbh Bent is probably not a great restaurant option for vegetarians and especially vegans given the heavier focus on meats/seafood, but there definitely are a few different plant-based options to choose from. 

For a pricier place I felt that the ambiance was actually pretty chill in spite of the dim lighting, candles, etc. A few couples were celebrating their anniversaries here and one pair dressed up -so Bent can be that kind of place too. Noise level was moderate as the place was definitely pretty busy.

We didn't order any drinks, but peeked at the drinks menu and saw some pretty innovative cocktails!

Food 4/5
Service 5/5 - we probably had 3 servers come around regularly to refill our glasses, literally clean the table between each dish, and even to toss our slaw
Ambiance - casual to classy, not great for kids
Price - over $20 per person so save it for a fancier occasion"}
{"text":"Went there during Summerlicious. Took a while for us to get seated but I guess that's what we got for not booking a reservation. Overall, the food was delicious and the service was very good. Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Bent was amazing. The service was friendly and very informative, the food really blew me away. The blend of new and classic flavours makes for a really good meal. The lobster tacos are amazing, I also loved the duck confit. The washroom and hall ways are hilarious and the logo themed uniforms were a nice touch. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD. DO NOT GO HERE!!

We had a reservation for 9:15 and when we arrived our table wasn't ready. The hostess said it would be an additional 15-20 min max, so we figured we would have a drink at the bar but that was impossible because the poorly designed space didn't   allow for people to wait at the bar - they opted to cram it with additional 2nd tier seating instead - SO we went for a drink at a local bar down the road and gave the hostess our cel # to call us when it was ready....... 10:15 rolled around and we still hadn't heard from the hostess so we walked back - the table was still not ready AND she informed us that it would most likely be another 15-20 min!!!!

My party was so upset and so was I - especially considering I was out with clients. We left and went to another place deserving of our patronage. We weren't even offered and consideration...sad. I WILL NEVER GO BACK! from 9:15 to 10:35.... really? Horrible Management.

After talking to a few friends that have been before they pretty much ALL had to wait an excess of 30min +. 

Do not waste your time or money."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for Winterlicous. We had heard about Susur Lee's famous Singaporean Slaw Salad and decided to order that on top of our three course meal. The food here was amazing. The aroma and the variety of ingredients that are used for each dish goes very well with each other. The staff was friendly and told us about each plate of food that was put on our table.

I had the peking crepe with braised beef as an appetizer and the flavors were bold and tasty. For entree I had the Asian duck confit and it was cooked to perfection. For dessert, there was a trio. I found it a great finish to the night. 

Everyone has to try the slaw. With over 15 ingredients, it's delicious! I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"The food was all super delicious but it was very rich for my stomach. All the flavours were there and the portion sizes were nice. I would definitely recommend this place but for myself I need a little more subdued menu."}
{"text":"I had been to Bent Restaurant in Toronto once before. Susur Lee was in the restaurant that night. It was in June 2013 for the Seafood Tasting for two. I recently made a 9 o'clock reservation for dinner. At 6 o'clock I went to the website to check the menu (out of date, of course). I also read some of the on-line reviews. I was sorely tempted to cancel the reservation. I did not. We were seated just before 9 pm. I ordered the Sashimi Tasting and the Truffled Japanese Beef Carpaccio. I asked the waiter to ensure that the dishes did not arrive at the table together. Twenty minutes later the Sashimi Tasting had not arrived. The server kept coming by the table saying \"soon\" and \"it was coming\". It was a cold dish. Six pieces of fish on ice. It took 30 minutes to arrive at the table. The second dish, also cold, took another 25 minutes to arrive at the table. When it arrived, I asked the waiter to order two hot dishes for us. When we finished the Carpaccio, the waiter asked us how we enjoyed the dish. We said it was good. He turned and left the table leaving the empty dirty dish sitting on the table. He returned a few minutes later to say the hot food was on the way. The next time we saw him he spent 5 minutes taking pictures of customers at another table close by. There was no sign of the Crispy Chicken Dumpling order. After waiting 25 minutes for the Chicken Dumpling we asked for a manager. After five minutes a manager showed up. By this time my patience was exhausted. We asked for the bill as we were leaving. His comment was \"We're overwhelmed tonight.\" We left."}
{"text":"fantastic, some friends were kind enough to treat us to an amazing dinner here, not quite sure why it's 3.5 stars.  The server was extremely friendly, quick, and knowledgeable of the menu.  We had two great bottles of wine and shared a number of items (tapas), probably the best short ribs I've ever had in my life.

I so will go back"}
{"text":"Another 5/5 for bent. I can to tell you enough how good this food is. I am so ridiculously full and satisfied. Best meal, every time."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive - the design of the space is awesome - really really love the room, the open kitchen - really well done.  Cool and laid back vibe - nice friendly staff - no airs...

I was not blown away by the food.  Everything was ok, but nothing was great - even items like the fried dumplings lacked a certain umph.  Have had better at Chinese take away.  We had the coconut & shrimp soup - probably the most flavourful - we also had the braised short rib which was good, but oddly plated with two conflicting starches and an off the mark mix of accent ingredients.  

Worst miss for me was the free dessert - nice touch normally but both were weak- left us wondering if anyone was tasting what they were plating.

I think they care, I think it could still be fun for a night out - definitely had a good vibe...but no need for foodies to rush to check it out..."}
{"text":"I came to Bent for Summerlicious 2015 and ordered from the special set menu consisting of the duck confit, the fried jerk chicken, and a dessert I ended up not having.

The duck confit was simply amazing, and the clear highlight of my meal. It was crispy on the outside and deliciously tender on the inside, and it surpassed every single one of my expectations. I've heard lots of good things about Susur Lee, head chef of Bent, but I attributed most of it to hype. The duck alone proved that the acclaim was well deserved.

The jerk chicken was also a pleasant treat. Just spicy enough to provide that \"kick\" that you want, but not too overboard with the flavour.

All in all, a fantastic experience from a restaurant I've been meaning to try for ages."}
{"text":"I really, really liked this place. I have been to Lee's Restaurant and Fring's (call me a Susur Lee groupie), but really enjoyed the brighter lighting and intimate patio at Bent. Lee's Restaurant doesn't have a patio, and the one at Fring's is very dark and closed off. 

The Singaporean Slaw. So many delicious, healthy ingredients. So, so good. It tasted exactly the same as the one at Lee's. SO GOOD! I could eat this everyday (if my budget could only handle)!

It's pretty pricey overall (e.g., My glass of sangria cost $18. One glass.), but I highly recommend Bent for a special night out."}
{"text":"This place is so popular, reservations are a recommended must. if you call them to book, give them your email, and within seconds receive an email confirmation! Saves me the trouble.

Once you find the corner property with the eclectic lit arrow sign pointing down to the door, prepare to salivate and enjoy yourself. The place is lively and loud as it is posh. And screaming of a character all its own--I have never dined at a place of this caliber that has so much personality built into the walls.

One must understand that Bent is the product of celebrity chef Susur Lee--a man considered by some to be amongst the best chefs in Canada or even the whole damned world--and his two sons. The family affair goes further than just ownership--the interior design is done by Susur's wife Brenda Bent. The sober contemporary and casual space becomes a gallery into the family's life at the back, where hundreds of small toys and other trinkets are neatly displayed in old lettertype trays. Prayer beads, cricket cages, vintage toys, Pokemon figures... all from the collections of Brenda and the boys. I love it; it is a unique approach to having art in a restaurant.

And if you think the gallery is neat, don't wait to go downstairs to visit the washrooms--another gallery!, of blown-up school photos. It all borders on nostalgic.

The cuisine is mainly what is typically called \"Asian fusion.\" But BENT does Asian fusion like you have never had before. This is after all the restaurant of a man who from my vague layperson understanding, made his mark in Toronto and elsewhere over the decades combining French and Chinese cuisines in a very elevated way--which is to say this ain't your fast food or Spring Rolls garden variety cuisine. It will turn out to be a very wonderful experience. There is also a raw bar here. Something to try for everyone: most of the food is meant to be shared among your party, which makes eating here a fun experience for a small group and those not accustomed to eating \"the Asian way\" in a Western fine dining setting. The menu I understand changes regularly, with plenty of special food and tasting events to mix things up. Small portions though.

We went in when Bent had the Summerlicious program running, which they are a newcomer to this year (2013). Their offerings deviate from their 'sharing is caring' philosophy by reverting to an individual dining affair typical of Summerlicious/Winterlicious. 'Licious or not, the food is nonetheless great, even sublime, and I enjoyed every bite like I am squeezing every penny out of it.

The beef ravioli is a bloody big-ass dish of awesome stomach-filling tender pulled meat that nearly killed me--bigger than anything else I have seen served here. The desert sampler all had that sublime 'just right' level of sweetness that I never had before. It's hard to describe 'just right' sweetness--you just know it when you taste something that is not too sweet nor not sweet enough, it makes you realize there is such a thing as a 'Goldilocks' level of sweetness. Just perfect.

Deviating from Summerlicious (and watching the bill quickly outdo the rate of inflation), I also ordered the duck confit spring rolls ($14), getting a taste of Susur's brand of Asian fusion. This ain't my mama's spring rolls. The goat cheese can be overpowering, but does help to bring out the duck. Crazy. Crazier is trying to figure out how to eat a spring roll using a knife and fork.

We also had a couple other things, like the octopus ceviche ($14), which was chewy and firm and certainly not gross.

The service is more than expected and respectable. So attentive, it can be scary. I'd gladly would tip really big if I came back from the toilet (because, you know, to check out the school photos they plastered on the walls, no?) to find my napkin folded into an origami. Didn't happen, but why not? They are more than gleeful in making recommendations you haven't thought of, and working around our allergies, lactose intolerance and other such quirks.

Bent was certainly built to be a foodie paradise as much as it is an eclectic posh expression of a family business. To get here, take the 505 or 511 streetcar to Dundas/Bathurst, and haul ass westwards until you find that flashy arrow sign on Markham St."}
{"text":"I must say the food here is definitely good. You can tell the chef, I presume Susur Lee, put a lot of thought in designing these dishes to be rich in flavor and complements of each other.

I had the winterlicious menu, and the presentation was excellent. It's especially rewarding as the servers explain the dishes as you glare mindlessly at it with your mouth drooling. Makes it that much more enjoyable.

I definitely recommend it. Be prepared for some good food that is cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"2.5 stars if we are speaking strictly about the food however I will give them 3 because of the chaotic yet somehow impeccable service (seriously, how does that happen?).

The precedence was set as i came to this establishment with sky high expectations all thanks to the Food Network & Co for really sensationalizing Susur in the recent years. And...I was met with nothing but disappointment. Maybe it was the summerlicious menu or perhaps the heat wave in Toronto really hindered my senses but the meal was bland at best.

There were a few notable mentions such as the Tuna ceviche and the trio of desserts (O so satisfying!). The jerk fried chicken tasted like flavorless, soggy, overnight orange chicken from Manchu Wok. And the sides that came with it... confusion is the best way to describe them. Last but not least...I am not sure that the duck confit (spring roll? ) really deserved a 3 inch thick wrapper. This thing can stop a bullet in its tracks.

After many years of seeing the man himself on TV, magazines and online, I was met with disappointment to say the least.

O, the service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"Tried the tasting menu which gave us a chance to taste a variety of items.  Everything was prepared for your eyes as well as for the taste buds.   Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Sad to hear Bent is closing at the end of May 2017, so I felt compelled to write about my dining experience on April 14, 2017 (yeah, late, I know).

Stopped by here with my friend to have dinner before we went to go see The Bodyguard musical over at the Ed Mirvish Theatre.  We were walking around in the area before our dinner reservation and noticed their Garden to Table poster outside their restaurant (vegetarian promotion at $38 per person for a four course meal).

We opted to try this out since we'd both never been to Bent before (we've been to Susur's other restaurants: Lee, Luckee); the promotion consisted of the following:
- Singaporean-Style Slaw
- Buddha Lettuce Cups
- Bent-O Box (moroccan chickpea stew, baba ganoush, cheeseburger spring roll, aloo gobi gratin)
- Homemade Almond Milk Panna Cotta

We managed to finish everything and it was all delicious.  My favourite was the aloo gobi gratin and baba ganoush... definitely an interesting take on these dishes.  I've had the Singaporean-style slaw before at Lee during a Winterlicious meal and the smaller portion for this promotion was just as good.

Overall, a good deal!  Sad to hear the restaurant is closing but hopefully Susur and his sons will open a new restaurant soon."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary, and I must say the food was very very good, we had the Singapore slaw, 6 fresh oysters with bacon vinaigrette, the duck confit spring rolls, the braised short ribs and finished it off with a delicious lemon meringue. Everything was fantastic.  Why only 4 stars and not 5?  The service started out great, food came out quickly, then we literally waited for our bill for 45 minutes.  I mean .. I can overlook that usually but when you're out of drinks and just sitting there twiddling your thumbs it gets old very quickly.... we wanted to get out of there and get on with our plans!"}
{"text":"I've been to lee and was super excited to try bent, as a sister restaurant to lee. 

The restaurant ambivalence is clean, rustic- modern. I would recommend a seat by the bar if you are dining with a dyad so you can watch the cooks/bartenders do their thang. 

We ordered the special seafood ceviche, grilled octopus, and curried lamb. 

The ceviche was a mix of different ingredients that reminded me of a smaller Singaporean slaw, but it was bland to me. It didn't really mash together for some reason for me. $24

Grilled octopus was flavourful and soft. We ordered this because other yelpers recommended it. It was good. I liked the presentation and taste. 

The lamb was to die for! My fave thing from what we ordered. It was moist, tender, and soft. The presentation was very pretty. I liked the pineapple curried sauce. Beware of the green sauce, it's spicy. I liked the pairing of quinoa banana. Gave a nice contrast to the dish. Definitely my fave! 

The drinks looked nice, but were underwhelming. We had the and also, and Georgetown storm. It wasn't very creative and it was a bit watered down for me. I would say, I liked the cocktails at Dailo way better. 

Overall, i felt bent was a bit of a copy cat of lee in the sense that some of the menu items were from lee's, like the Singaporean slaw and tong yuen. I was disappointed that it didn't have a lot of its own uniqueness. 

Going down to the washrooms, I saw class pics and student pics of people. It made me wonder who those people were and what the significant was for the family. I wished were there captions to to explain!"}
{"text":"Tremendous flavorful food. Try the watermelon- tuna ceviche salad which was just amazing. The short ribs were insane as well. A must in Toronto."}
{"text":"There was a mix up with our reservation, Stephanie who took down our reservation over the phone booked us at Lee instead of Bent. But the manager, Christian, took really good care of us, even Chef Lee came out to apologize and got us a bottle of Prosecco and 3 appetizers while we waited for a table. I thought that was really nice of them. My sister is 9 months pregnant so this was our family celebration before the baby's arrival. I was in town from San Francisco and my parents from Montreal and we are big foodies so I'm glad it all worked out. Our server, Anthony, was really great all night. My favorites: Signature Singapore Slaw, 19 ingredients of awesomeness, a modern and vegan version of  the traditional Yu Sheng salad I used to have in Singapore for Chinese New Year with my family. The braised beef ravioli with chanterelle was also a huge hit with my family, the pasta was perfect and aldente, the filling- oh so good. 

Every dish we were served from the Chef's Menu was spot on! 
Crispy chicken dumpling spicy chorizo 
Duck confit spring rolls with goat cheese 
Vegetarian roll w cucumber tofu & miso 
Taro lobster taco with mango 
Charred salmon with pumpkin seed, pumpkin oil and cream fraiche 
Poached pressed octopus with potato salads 
Spicy tuna with watermelon
Desserts: Mango panna cotta, chocolate pudding cake, meringue, mochi. 

I was just sad I didn't get to take a pic with Chef Lee before he left because the food was great and a memorable. Our last epic meal before 2015. Thank you Bent, Chef Lee, Levi and Kai!"}
{"text":"This was the most memorable meal of our trip.  The worst part was having to choose from the menu because everything sounded amazing.  We ordered a couple appetizers and entrees and every dish was exceptional. The salmon tartare and the oyster shots were great.  We ordered the game hen special and wow! Also have to mention the superb service.  Can't say enough great things about this gem."}
{"text":"So being back in Toronto has had it's challenges.  Easy to find great live music, but helluva a time to find solid food at a decent price.  So why not try and give Mr. Iron Chef's place a shot.  I mean it HAS to be good, right?

Walking into the restaurant it has a nice atmosphere about it.  Busy.  Wonderful aromas coming from the kitchen.  No shitty music playing.  Broken down, the way a restaurant should be.  

Get sat pretty quickly at the bar (due to reservations only) and pop a bottle of wine to start the evening.  Waiter is slow to receive us, but then makes it up with a bit of banter.  Walks us through the menu and we get to reviewing how dinner will be served.  

The decision is:
- oysters 
- kale salad
- chicken dumplings
- ceviche
- short rib

Long story short, the plates were well prepared, seasoned solidly and somewhat imaginative.  Where it was just \"meh\" for me was that when you package it all together  it was definitely a let down.  The pricing, service and food as a whole just weren't up to the expectations one would get when dining at a place with a chef/owner of this calibre.  

I've been lucky enough to dine across North America and other parts of the globe, and I feel like this was Toronto's first attempt to show me it had the chops to match SF, NYC, London, etc.  Unfortunately, it didn't."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Bent is a lovely little Asian Fusion place on Dundas W by Top Chef Master, Susur Lee.

Nice, clean modern décor. I did, however, find the bench seating a bit uncomfortable to sit in for an hour or so.

Service wasn't bad, though nothing to write home about. We were told if we were 16 minutes late our table would be kapoot, so we ensured to get our booties there on time for our 5:30pm reservation (it was a late Summerlicious booking, so only the early bird and night owl times were still available.)

FOOD: Appetizer: I tried both the chicken dumpling and shrimp tacos. Both were good but not standouts, or terribly unique. We happily gobbled down every morsel off of our plates. I'd rate the apps at a 3-3.5

Main: The mains we had really were the star here. Absolutely incredible, and almost flawless. Great portion sizes for each so you won't go home hungry. The Pulled Beef Ravioli was pretty unique, and my personal favourite. The pasta was yummy, and the pulled beef was incredibly tender & delicious. My mouth is watering thinking about it! I also tried the Salmon which was cooked to absolute perfection, and the chicken purse stuffed with spinach and ricotta that was also quite good. Mains were definitely 5 star worthy.

Desserts: For me, the desserts on the whole really dropped the ball. I quite enjoyed the mango & passion fruit pannacotta - it was flavourful, light, and delicious. The cream puff tasted dry and like it could have been a once frozen pastry. The Strawberry, Rhubarb and Lemongrass Compote wasn't anything special, and again, the butterfly pastry that came with it was quite dry. I was not a fan. Desserts were a 2.5-3, and would be lower if it wasn't for the pannacotta to save the day.

Overall it was a really good experience. I will most certainly be back to check out Bent in a non-Summerlicious setting!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner with the boyfriend. The service was from the front hostess was great but our server seemed less than enthused about us. I had the lobster tacos which were pretty good but nothing special. I also had the salmon sashimi ceviche and this was not good at all! The pickle flavour was too much and overall me and my bf were not a fan of this which was a waste of $20! One of the servers was stopping at each table offering bread and hummus with a squirt of Siracha in the middle for $7 which was decent but again not amazing! The braised short rib came out a decent amount of time after the rest of the dishes and this was actually delicious and what I was expecting every dish to be like! It had that wow factor I was expecting after reading all these reviews. Lastly we had the signature chocolate tong turn dessert served with Indian pastry. The tong yuen was amazing and the Indian pastry was just okay. Overall I thought it was overpriced for food that wasn't amazing. Would not return except maybe for that dessert!"}
{"text":"Just stepped in my wife and I for a dinner but we didn't check any reviews. Elegant, nice vibe, they will tell you \"our style is dishes to share\"...BS.....portion size is small, or let's say just adequate. We ordered watermellon-Tuna Ceviche...great, amazing flavor and textures. Lobster Taco....has no taste of any lobster, but taste good..avocado and mango, nice sauce...but not lobster (4 small hard shell tacos)
Finally we ordered the short ribs..TWO PIECES ONLY....yes melt in the mouth, great flavor, perfect sauce, amazing parsnip puree..BUT $26 FOR 2 PIECES OF SHORT RIBS, 1.5 sq inch each?....I might go again...what to say? Canada....small portions...expensive bill in a nutshell...forgot to mention ...the owner is chef Susur Lee ..Chopped Canada Judge, he was there checking on staff"}
{"text":"This little place was a pleasant surprise - a bit on the loud side with the frat boys  and gf's at an 8 top.

Food was amazing - oysters from PEI - fat, clean with simple add ons.

The signature slaw is a must - it gets mixed at the table from the mounds of veggies - the water skillfully described the myriad of veggies and sauces within its content.  A skill in and of itself.

The Lobster Tacos- in shells of crisp taro root were a bit hot for my partner but tasty though a bit messy

The Spicy tuna and watermelon cerviche was less hot and a nice combo of tuna and crisp watermelon - can taste the freshness

Next were the oven bakes scallops - 4 juicy morsels with a combination of earthy, sweet veggies - we wanted to lick the plate - a must have.  Having had scallops world-wide this dish was by far the best combination.

The short-ribs were sweet and melt in your mouth, another winner.

My only irritation is having so many service people work the table. We never knew who was in charge or what their names were.  I like to treat service people like regular guys and gals and that's hard to do when 4-6- people work a table.  One of the dishes was wrong and we had to wait longer - three people came to apologize - but not sure who was in charge.  Not liking this trend.

Desserts were OK but they seemed to be trying too hard here - a chocolate chip-banana cake with hot chocolate sauce with a blueberry compote and a house made marshmallow on the same plate- think lighter and look for that spectacular ending to a meal 

Will return, made the foodie in me hope this food trend continues"}
{"text":"Excellent overpriced coleslaw. 

They have the nerve to charge $26 for a serving of this coleslaw.    

They tell you a story about how there are nineteen ingredients in the fancy coleslaw.   They feverishly keep explaining to you how this is Chef Lee's signature dish.  

It's probably his favorite dish because it's the running joke he tells his friends at parties.   How he charges suckers the price of what my Rolling Stones Voodoo Lounge tour tickets cost me in 1994 for a bowl of coleslaw. 

If this was reality, we would be allowed to bitchslap the waiter for even suggesting this ridiculousness.     Let's be honest, this is one of the only places on earth where you can buy coleslaw that costs greater than was originally paid for the island of Manhattan.

It's very good. 

Unfortunately, very little else at this restaurant was memorable in the slightest.   Much of it fell into the traps of \"unnecessarily ostentatious\" that seems to plague many of these type of faux-fancy restaurants in the city.  

You don't feel special here.    And it's nothing that you can't find on Spadina street for one quarter the price and triple the experience."}
{"text":"I have nothing but amazing things to say about Bent. It is by far my favourite Japanese fusion restaurant. The tuna and watermelon salad is a perfect start to a meal. The fish is extremely fresh, the presentation is impeccable and the flavours are out of this world. I completely fell in love with their oyster shooter! A MUST try for any foodie!"}
{"text":"Came here for a winterlicious double date over the weekend. This restaurant was pretty busy and the noise level was quite loud. The decor is unique and well put together. As you look around you'll keep finding something different to look at. 
The service was on point although it took a while for us to receive the bill.

Menu was short, one page for winterlicious, one page for the regular menu. We ordered from both menus. It was our friends first winterlicious experience and they loved it. They were surprised by the portion size but we all shared our food so our tummies were filled up nicely. 

For drinks we ordered  2xAsian Caesars, a Yuzu bourbon sour and a Georgetown storm. 

Off the regular menu we ordered half a dozen ($24) oysters and the rack of lamb ($35).
The oysters were delicious, I wish we had ordered a full dozen! The rack of Lamb was very delicious as well.. Came right off the bone!

Appetizers 
1. 2xFrench and Japanese salmon tartare
The flavours of this tartare were very unique with a nice kick at the end. 
2. Pulled beef and braised onion Peking crepe
This crepe was very savoury, definitely one of the highlights of the meal. 

Mains
1. 2xBraised beef papillotte
The beef came in a bag that was cut by the server. The beef is then put on the dish with the other ingredients. 
2. Ancient grain and forbidden rice risotto
The texture and consistency of this was perfect and the flavours were nicely layered. 
 
Dessert Trio
1. Tiramisu
2. Churro
4. Lemon curd and lady fingers 
I was least impressed by the dessert. You get the trio with the summerlicious menu. The flavours of the three desserts didn't mix well together. My palate was confused by all the different tastes. The tiramisu was nice but I really only liked the top part. The lady fingers were nice but the lemon curd took away from the dessert as a whole.. It was too sour for me. The churro came with a caramel sauce and a chocolate sauce, nothing too special. 

Overall, this experience was a very memorable one. I would definitely recommend coming for winterlicious or summerlicious for delicious 3 course meal at a good price ($48). I would suggest ordering off the regular menu as well."}
{"text":"Wow..each dish had layers upon layers of flavor. Lobster tacos, slaw, calamari, steak special and black cod. Not one dish had a complaint. Service was spot on with attention displayed as each server delivering a dish would describe the components. It enhanced the salivating going on at the table. Only complaint....noise level was quite loud. Had to submit to sign language while conversing with dinner date across table. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner for their bento box special. The first dish that came out was a soup and all I remember from it is how salty it was. What was cool was that they fried this thin piece of tomato which wasn't just pretty to look at but quite delicious. We ordered a lot of food that night so I can't remember every dish I had. However, generally speaking, the food was good. The reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is because I don't think it was outstanding. There were many dishes that were way too salty for my liking and for the price I pay, I think every dish should be done perfectly.

However, I would love to come back here for a drink someday because the bartender looks like he really knows what he's doing. Unfortunately, I didn't order a drink that day because our table already ordered a bottle of wine to share."}
{"text":"Food was average, not the greatest. The sister resto \"LEE\" is a lot better. Went during summerlicious, that's probably why it was average."}
{"text":"The food was good, but they charge $8 for regular water. The waiters were wonderful but at the reception were these horrible, stuck-up girls who think they own the restaurant. Bad attitude and customer service, suggest you find new people to replace them."}
{"text":"My experience at Bent started out pretty rocky. We had a reservation for 9 on the patio. We were seated at 9:45. It took another 30 minutes to get out first drink. 

The manager came over and apologized for the wait times and sent us a round of drinks. From then on, everything started changing for the better. 

We ordered our food from the summerlicious menu, which had great selections, and ordered a slaw for the four of us to share. 

The staff were very attentive and accommodating to a food allergy one of us had. 

The slaw was amazing, I order this every time I go to Lee and is always one of my favourite parts of the meal. I had the duck confit roll with goat cheese and tamarind sauce,  the black cod and the dessert trio. All were amazing! I also tried some of my companions spicy tuna ceviche and fried jerk chicken. So delish!!!

This was an epically amazing meal and the best summerlicious/winterlicious I have ever done (and I have done a LOT!!)"}
{"text":"Where to begin!  Bent Restaurant is owned By celebrity Chef Susur Lee and his sons. The menu is Asian fusion and the plates are sharing style, although the portion sizes are def small enough for 1  person.

Our table of 2  ordered 5  plates and by the time the dessert came we were happily stuffed.

1) Singapore Slaw: piled high and tossed at the the table while the list of about 12 ingredients were being explained.  So many different flavours and textures, that worked together harmoniously.  This was the largest portion for the 5  dishes.

2) Beef  Carpaccio: thinly sliced beef, in a slightly sweet marinate, pears, braised shiitake mushrooms - my favorite dish!!! Everything was perfectly chilled and the marinate was all over the beef not just drizzled on. This plate was the smallest size of the 5  plates.

3) Duck Confit and Goat Cheese Spring Rolls: exactly what is sounds like! Deep fried and crispy on the outside and the goat cheese was soft and warm. The duck had a sweetness to it which went so well with the goat cheese.

4 ) Shrimp and Crab Arancini: deep fried Italian rice balls with shrimp, crab, and peas.  It was the daily feature and came recommend by our server.  There was so much seafood, cooked to perfection, in the rice balls!

5) Braised Short Ribs: served on parsnip puree, with heirloom carrots, and duck fat fried potatoes. I cannot begin to tell you how amazing this dish was.  We later found out from Chef Susur Lee himself (!!!!) that the beef was braised or super low heat for 24 hrs.

Average cocktail was $13, huge sake list.

Chef Susur Lee was actually there saying hello to everyone.  We had the chance to take pictures and actually talk about the food and our experience. I told him that I ordered items based on what he posted on IG which he thought was cleaver (!!!).  When we told him we were waiting on his signature dessert he excused himself and went to check on it for us.  It instantly appeared  immediately after.

Dessert) French/Canadian Tong Yuen: rice  paper dough (not totally sure), filled with warm chocolate and hazelnuts, topped with creme anglais and a fresh raspberry.

STUFFED!

The staff  are knowledgeable, courteous, and efficient - down to the waitress who took our coats. There are tea lights at each table. We kept accidentally blowing ours out and within minutes our server was there to re-light it. It became a running joke. The  manager, Christian, was extremely personable and made excellent recommendations.

You need to go to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Good spot.
8:30 reso for 4. Showed up and were surprised to see thay there were only 1 or 2 tables with people at them...more on the patio. The place filled up a little more as the night went on, but they definitely did not complete a full turn at each table that night. It was August and cottage season though.
That being said, food was great.

Coleslaw- Delivers on the hype. Must order. 
Lobster tacos- Excellent
Duck confit lettuce wraps- Excellent
Caramelized Black Cod- Excellent
Shrimp - Really good but weakest dish of the might. Still good though.
Braised Short Rib - Excellent but very rich. But hey, it's a braised short rib, it should be rich.
Jerk Pork Chop Special- Very good

We didn't have desert.
House Sake was nice and clean.
Had cocktails. They were good but I wasn't blown away. That's ok though, I's rather excellent fold and average cocktails.

Service was good. Cocktails took a while to come out given how quiet the restaurant was when we ordered them. 

Overall great spot to go as 4 or more and share a bunch of dishes."}
{"text":"Bent is a small and cozy restaurant somewhere  in between cool and  yuppie. The food is very good and flavourful. It is consistent. You must order 4 to 5 dishes to fill up. Dishes to try: Braised short rib, scallop w/ sun dried tomato, Japanese beef
Expect to spend at least $120. 

The service is friendly until you tip them 15% and the smile quickly turns into a frown :(. They didn't even say have a good night on the way out or even look at you after the bill was paid. For sure they could use some training that no matter what the tip is to always be polite and professional.  The service is OK but nothing special to deserve anything more.

Update:
I was at the Keg and this is an example of why Bent falls flat on its face when it comes to service. My wife's stake was well done instead of medium rare. So they said no problem and the manager not the waitress brought out the new one. They took my plate and warmed it up and refilled the fried onions. Then there was a discount on the bill. This is exemplary service!! They obviously get it that a happy customer is more important that the cost of the food. Well done! No pun intended!"}
{"text":"what a hidden gem !! After visiting Susur Lee's flagship restaurant, we set low expectations from this place. The online menu had enough appeal/potential to excite our palate so we went with our gut and showed up on what turned out to be a busy friday night. We also saw Susur guiding his troops and occasionally spending time at a table

I am so glad I ordered that bourbon cocktail which was pricey ($16) but so heavenly.

COCONUT SHRIMP SOUP
Green Curry Broth, with Tomato, Corn, Squash, Mint and Cilantro

Soup was divine !!! I think it had a slight hint of lemongrass which upped the flavor profile of the dish.

LOBSTER TACOS
This was probably my least favorite dish. Portions are tiny and price is steep but flavors were good !!

BRAISED SPICED SHORT RIBS
Black Garlic, Truffled Parsnip Puree, Roasted Rosemary Duck Fat Potato with Sour 
Cream, Chives

This is by far the most flavor packed short ribs dish I've ever had !!! I did not really care for the rosemary duck fat potato but the tenderness of the ribs and the sauce that goes with it was mind blowing.

To put the icing on the cake, desserts are on the house. We asked for a dessert menu and did not hear our server clearly since it was  so loud and kept wondering what the deal is with desserts. Finally, to our surprise desserts arrived at the table. They are nothing out of this world but it is a nice gesture for appreciating customers. 

I'd definitely visit this place over Lee due to the concept of the menu. A welcome addition to an otherwise insipid neighborhood."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Went here in the last few days of Summerlicious, and it was soooo goood! We lucked out with sitting outside and the service was always fast and attentive. We got the additional tuna tartar add-on, which was amazing. Beautiful presentations all the way through on each course. But the tartar and the tuna/watermelon cerviche were gorgeous. 
I had the mushroom and polenta dish that was outstanding. I LOVE when the polenta is all gritty. 

Can't wait to return to Bent!"}
{"text":"Great overall experience

We had the signature Singaporean slaw, an excellent choice as the dish was very large in portion and flavourful. It is all vegetarian too, this a fairly healthy choice. 

Then came the black cod, tenderly grilled with just a bit of char to add flavour. The side bacon was delicious too. 

Beef rib was a great finishing item, and it came with about three different sauces and some mashed potato. None was taken out and it was fully cooked and was not difficult to eat at all. We felt we ate a bit too much after this so we skipped dessert. 

It was my girlfriend's birthday and they provided a complimentary happy birthday dessert for her. Very considerate staff."}
{"text":"Bent is awesome!! I just got home from the meal and I've had 2 shots, 2 cocktails, and half a bottle of sake.  So forgive me if this review turns out to be incoherent.  Drunk Yelping is the best kind of Yelping! Yayyy!!

Pros:
-  Elder Goose was great
-  Pressed octopus had the perfect texture and the pomegranate had no seeds!! Is there a sweatshop in the back pitting them??!!
-  Rare beef was amazing!  I expected to have the texture of beef carpaccio but the texture was more cooked which highlighted the beef against the acidity of the dressing
-  The duck confit spring rolls were rich and decadent. ORDER THEM!
- The caviar and lobster shooter had a shot glass made out of ICE

Cons:
-  I wish the tofu in the kale salad were the firm kind.  The flavours were good but the textures were all too aloof in that dish for me
-  The bruschetta and the caviar shooter didn't really have all that much caviar taste
-  Some of the tarragon in my mojito were chopped too finely so they kept coming up my straw
-  Tables are too close together.   

I think that's about pretty much it.  I had a great time but we did also spend a sh*t load of money so... I guess that should be a con too (?).  I'm ready to go to bed.  Good night everyone!"}
{"text":"We had the slaw and bento box special. Both were great. The bent box included oyster shots which were so good we ordered 2 more shots! To drink, we had Patty's Cherry and Georgetown Storm. The drinks were a little too sour for our liking. The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Uninteresting and weird.

Uninteresting food. The only thing I liked was the Vietnamese ceviche. The lemongrass was a very nice touch and it infused well with the ceviche recipe. The lobster taco was OK. Other things we ordered were just meh. Nothing very creative.

Weird service. I get the vibe that the waiter is very proud of what they do here, and tells us how unique their style is but honestly they just recommend sharing food. Its called family style. You didn't invent it. Thats how people eat dinner normally. Seriously. The waiter was very didactic the whole time. 

Dude, I really dont care."}
{"text":"I went here on the suggestion of a co-worker. The only thing she said of the place was that everything she ate melted in her mouth. I figure, sure, it's a Susur Lee place, obviously it's good but will I like it? I looked at the menu and I'm not gonna lie, I didn't really get it. I'm not a foodie by any means so I invited my foodie friend to dinner to try this place out.  I kept an open mind and we got some great suggestions from our server. We started with 3 dishes which come out at different time, as they were prepared in the kitchen. The service was impeccable. Dishes were cleared and reappeared, drinks were expertly prepared and replenished.   

We tried the following dishes: 
Braised Spiced Short Ribs
Pan Seared Snapper (substitute for salmon special)
Polenta Gratin
Duck Confit/Goat Cheese Spring Rolls

I was blown away buy every single dish we ordered. The food was amazing. The sauces, my god the sauces! I have to say my favourite dish was the snapper, which is not usually on the menu. We were so lucky to have tried it and hopefully it shows up on menu again! While I was sitting there, I was already ready to make my next reservation. Whatever I didn't manage to eat this time, I would come back and eat next time. 

We ended up paying $80/each, tip and drinks included. It was worth every penny, and I'd spend it again in a second. I loved that that this a family restaurant which invites its diners into their warm, cozy embrace. Bent is the maiden name of Susur Lee's wife and one of their sons was there working the grind. The intimate seating lends to feeling like part of the family.

I can't remember the last 5 star review I put up; everyday is Christmas when you eat at Bent.

Oh, and I used the handy Yelp! app to book my table from this page!"}
{"text":"i always have a great meal here. I feel like it's unfair to call this fusion as that usually as a negative connotation as cheap and watered down Chinese food. That could not be further from the truth at Bent. All the dishes are well designed and very avant-garde. I can tell a lot of r&d goes into each of the dishes served there.

The decor at the restaurant is also very welcoming. Modern and classy at the same time."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. My fiancé and I came here to find hair in our dessert. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"With only 2 weeks left before the last dinner being served at Bent, I decided to enjoy my first and only dinner here.  The previous reviews seem to be mostly positive but there has been some grumblings about value.  My dinner here was quite good with some excellent dishes and thoughtful service.  It is definitely one of the more expensive places I've been but there are some dishes are worthwhile to try despite the price tag.

The dining area is really well done.  They have such a thoughtful entrance built to avoid having the Canadian wind blow through the entire dining area.  I really wish more high end restaurants in Canada and northern American restaurants thought of this.  The russet, marigold, and golden wood tones give a refined and yet warm atmosphere.  It isn't a large restaurant but they do pack in the tables quite closely.  I had to turn side ways to slide by the other table to get into my seat.  

The service was interesting... our actual waiter was efficient but seemed bored.  The food servers/runners were more of the fun and warm.  They were so attentive and aware of everything.  A fork drops and it's replaced literally within seconds.  A dish finished... 30 seconds later, it's whisked away with the table wiped gently to remove any food.  New food dishes are given a whole new set of flatware and dishes to be used. I havent seen attentive service like this in a long time.

As for the food, we ordered the signature dish of Singaporean Slaw to start.  Even if you hate salad, this is completely worthwhile to order.  It's visually impressive and the taste is even better.  Its 19 ingredients plated to create a towering creation and its mixed at the table... quite amusing as pieces of fried taro are just spraying about.  It's a very good balance between sour, savoury, and tart.. it also has so many wonderful textures.  It's one of the most interesting and delicious salads I've had.  We also got some tuna sashimi on the side... that we could have omitted as it was just a simple dish with minimal flavour.  We also got the Lump crab taco and that was good as well.  Using crispy rice as the shell, it was filled with sweet crab meat and it was stuffed as much as it can be.  It had a nice touch of sweet with small slivers of mango and a touch of heat on it to give it some depth.  Just very good overall.  We then had the caramelized cod.  This was really well executed.  The fish was flaking just perfectly but still very moist.  The sauce was an interesting mix of savoury with a touch of sweetness.  I think it was a tad oversalted but the tarragon butter sauce underneath help minimize the saltiness.  Next we had the braised beef... similar to the fish, just well executed.  It was so tender you can cut it with a spoon.  The concern was that the sauce was really salty. Unfortunately there was no other sauce to take away from the saltiness.  I wouldn't order this one again. For dessert we had their specialty and it was a wonderful presentation.  Tang yuen in chinese soup spoons and tiny pani puri with your own individual pour of tropical fruit sauce.  I'm used to these Asian dishes but loved Susur Lee's take on it.  It's an homage to it's roots of Asian cooking but a modern twist that makes it his.  

Overall, its a great place... just be careful on what you order as they seem to have a few dishes that are quite salty but definitely order the Singaporean Slaw, Crab Tacos, and their signature dessert.  There's only 2 weeks left to enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Everything I put in my mouth was delicious! It's pricy and portions are not very big but we were a group of six people sharing eight dishes and we were satisfied. We had the waiter accommodate the plates so that we could try all dishes. For example certain dishes like the shrimp , lamb etc usually come in fours but the waiter added two of everything so that we could each have one. I was pretty full after the meal. I started with the And Also drink (Broker's gin, tromba tequila, aperol, lillet blanc, watermelon juice, cucumber, simple syrup, fresh sours, grapefruit bitters). It was good...fruity and not too sweet. I then had the Asian Caesar (Wyborowa vodka, clamato, sesame chili oil, coriander, hoisin, stomachs, ginger) which was very flavorful. We shared the Singaporean style slaw, crab taco, grilled octopus, szechuan style garlic shrimp, black cod, rack of lamb, handmade gnocchi, and braised beef. The slaw was huge and  surprisingly good considering I don't get excited over vegetables or cole slaw. The taco was small but oh so delicious! There was mango and avocado inside. The grilled octopus was probably one of the best I ever had. I totally would order it again. It was cooked to perfection and the sauce was so good (Moroccan chickpea fritters, chimichurri, squid ink charred sweet pepper skin puree). The caramelized black cod was small and we all had one bite only but it was very good. It wasn't Nobu good but it was still very very good. It came with double smoked bacon with green beans on top as well as avocado puree, chrispy chickpeas and carrot lemon emulsion. The lamb came with a lentil stew with tomato mustard seed and curry leaf, quinoa crusted banana fritters , chili mint chutney and mango salsa. The handmade gnocchi with spinach, chorizo, wild mushrooms, goat cheese, parmesan, pine nuts, truffle oil was rich and oh so awesome. I wish I didn't have to share! The szechuan style garlic shrimp with bean crumble and lime leaf was pretty big. The spiced braised beef and roasted vegetables was probably my least favorite and least memorable dish."}
{"text":"Good ingredients, fresh items and combinations. However, not all items on the menu are worth it.

Lobster tacos are just disappointing (no lobster taste, taro taco flavour is overwhelming; you'd got better in any food truck). Lobster caviar is... original with strong flavours but nothing beyond. 

Jerk chicken is good. Shrimps and dumpling entree is very good, as well as artichoke salad and veggie fritters. Cocktails are good.

Place is noisy and tables close to each other. Susur Lee is sometimes in the place, and looks like him (not smiling but it is nice to see him around).

An interesting place to try. Not sure I will return (next time around I may rather go to Marguerita pizza across the street when open!)"}
{"text":"What is with the urinals?? Two men would have to stand thigh to thigh if there were a high demand to relieve bladders.

That out of the way, I had a very memorable date at Bent. The ambiance is modern and chic. The waiter informed us that dishes here were designed to be shared and recommended 3-4 for a party of two. We ordered the Yucatan(?) ceviche (an off-menu special for which I'm unsure of the actual name), beef carpaccio, homemade gnocchi, and the black cod. All dishes were unique and absolutely delectable. The ceviche came with what seemed to be some sort of root vegetable tortilla chips, and was tasty show of bright citrus flavours. The gnocchi with the mushrooms and chorizo was a nice rustic combination of vegetal and cured savouriness. The cod seemed ordinary at first glance but proved to be quite delicious, with the gentle flakiness of the cod and the puree being a nice match. My personal favourite by far was the carpaccio. The pear, the vinaigrette, the beef, and the shoestring potatoes were the dominant robust flavours/textures that contrasted and were melded together perfectly in my mouth. My date and I left extremely satisfied and wallet permitting, we hope to come back to experience Bent's other offerings (perhaps come Summerlicious)."}
{"text":"Tried their new tasting menu for around 40$ a person which was well worth it for a place like this. Was able to try a variety of dishes, including Lee's signature salad and his cheeseburger spring rolls. My dining partner and I left quite full, and would definitely come back to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"My favourite dishes are the signature Singaporean Slaw and Beef Raviolis. The slaw embodies Bent's mission statement. You should have this first as it gives you a little teaser of what's to come. The contrast and balance in taste and texture provided by 19 ingredients makes for a wickedly cool and delicious salad. The beef raviolis are giant and super stuffed with a mouth watering tender beef filling. 

The lobster taro tacos and the ceviche did not wow me like the other dishes. The spicy tuna ceviche is unconventional and overly citrusy. Although the sweet and sour cubes of pickled watermelon were interesting. 

Of the desserts, the French meringue is a must try. Tart lemon curd is drizzled over the light and crispy meringue and it's topped with fresh berries."}

Bent serves really interesting Fusion food. A good restaurant if you want to experience something different as the menu incorporate ingredients and techniques from around the world. 

I was here for a group tasting menu ($35) which is quite similar with Summerlicious menu but with a choice of cocktail (Gin Sour or Elder Goose)

App: Goat Cheese Taco
Main: Crispy \"Assam\" Salmon and Pulled Beef Ravioli
Dessert: 

I was glad that I known the people I was sharing my food with as they were all served tapas style and the 3 small dessert duo has to be shared between the 3 of us.

The Goat Cheese Taco was amazing good and I usually dislike goat cheese. Pulled Beef Ravioli was well flavoured and the Salmon was nice and refreshing. The dessert though really meh aside from the Mango Passion Sago pudding.

The noise level here is loud and table really packed close together. It is good for a group but not really ideal for a intimate date with that special someone.

I probably would be back as try out other items on the menu. They even have a Bent X sake brewed specially by Izumi. Interesting! :)"}
{"text":"I came here with low expectations. They were exceeded. Ate the lobster tacos, oysters with yuzu, tuna/watermelon ceviche, Peruvian ceviche, and the tartare 2-ways. Everything was pretty solid except for the Peruvian ceviche, which was disappointingly bland next to the tuna/watermelon one.

We didn't order any hot dishes. I suppose those would be easier to f-up than oysters and ceviche (and it seems that's where the kitchen's issues lie), but it was all well-executed, if a little derivative/dull.

The muddled raspberry mojito was good.

Service was friendly but pretty awkward. Place was only about 1/4 full, but I'll chalk that up to it being a Wednesday night and the first game of the Leafs' series.

Hope you like taro, because you will become well-acquainted with it over the course of 3-4 dishes here...

A weak four-star review, but I had no complaints and 4/5 dishes were pretty good."}
{"text":"Popped in here last night for an impromptu dinner, and the front hostess was kind enough to grant us a table (reserved for another party, but she said we could have it for 45 minutes.) The dishes are meant for sharing, which I love because then you get to try lots of different things. We ordered the following:

Vietnamese seafood ceviche - My favourite dish of the night. They did not skimp on the seafood or the flavour with this dish. Absolutely delicious, and all of the seafood tasted so fresh and refreshing.

Lobster tacos - These are interesting because the taco shell is made out of a taro chip. The taro flavour really comes through, but I felt like the other flavours were a bit light (i.e. lobster was not very flavourful and I also couldn't really taste the mango.) Then again, it might have been because I ate the seafood ceviche first, which overwhelmed my taste buds.

Pulled beef and braised onion peking crepe - This was delicious, although a very tiny portion. The caramelized brandy apple on the side was sooo fragrant, and the goat cheese balanced out the savoury beef and sauce really well.

Quinoa crusted onion rings - Satisfying and a nice little side. It comes with greek yogurt, sweet chili relish, and chili mint chutney for dipping. I loved the chili mint chutney, it was so unique and very refreshing, and actually all of the sauces blended together really well.

Dessert: lemongrass and passionfruit panna cotta - Great flavours, very refreshing way to end off the meal. Panna cotta was super smooth and silky, and I liked the black rice that was hidden under it.

The restaurant is fairly small, dimly lit, but has a very cool, trendy ambiance. Apparently Susur Lee spends a lot of time here now, and we actually saw him while we were here!! He'll even come around to your table and chat with you and take photos if you request it, but we were too shy and starstruck haha.

I was pleasantly surprised by this Asian fusion restaurant and can honestly say I enjoyed every single dish I ate here. I was pleasantly surprised by the bill too, just under $100 for three people, and we were decently full. I'd love to come again to dine at a more leisurely pace next time, and also to try their signature Singaporean slaw, which I unfortunately missed out on this time!"}
{"text":"Bent-O Seafood Tasting for 2 

After seeing picture of Bent's Seafood Bent-O Box on twitter, Bent Restaurant (@BentRestaurant) suddenly moved right to the top of my to-eat list. On top of that, it was such a great deal at $35 for 2 before 7pm and $42 onward. I have been meaning to visit for ages since I am a big fan of Susur Lee (@susurlee) and he's behind the menu. This is definitely a family affair with the sons, Kai and Levi Bent-Lee reining the restaurant and Lee's wife behind the design of the space.

Love the casualness of the space with an array of vintage childhood toys on display.
Since the special will only be available until June 8th, the place was packed on this Friday night and we only manage to secure seats at the bar.


We were still in sake redrawal after the Kampai Sake event the day before, we didn't order sake as usual... so I had the Feature Cocktail instead which was a Mojito w/ Yuzu $15 while Ben had a Tsing Tao Beer $7.

I have to say that the price of their cocktails was rather steep but mine was a rather large glass but I notice that some other ones being served was rather small with price ranging from $14 to $18.

 Seafood Bent-O include the following :

Lime Coconut Curry Shrimp Soup 
~ tomato, corn, squash, crispy puff rice 
~ I was very surprise at how light and flavorful this was, normally coconut soup are just heavy and very one dimentional in taste. 
~ This one, you can taste every components and just pack so much flavor.

 Then the rest was served at once in a large Bento Box:

 Lobster Tacos
~ charred onion tomato salsa, chipotle, avocado, in taro shell (bottom centre)
We got one in taco shell and one in wonton shell, they should have stick with the taro as per the menu since it was a better texture and taste with the lobster fillings.

Pressed Octopus
~ lentil, tomato, black garlic, perilla, herbed olive oil, pomegranate vinaigrette
~ This was a very interesting dish with the octopus without much flavoring apart from it's own seweetness while the vinaigrette was rather salty but interested flavor that I believe come from the black garlic.

 Oyster Sake Shot
~ lemongrass, shallots, ponzu marinated salmon roe
~ I was king of surprise that we were not serve this before the soup since this was the first item on the menu but I sort of understand since the soup was served hot and had a stronger flavor compare to the dishes to come. So the tart vinegary liquid here act sort of like a cleanser.

  Tuna+Watermelon Ceviche
~ shaved red onion, cilantro, crispy shallots, fresh citrus juice, Rocoto chili, Chinese doughnut fritter
~ Love the thing slices of Chinese doughnut fritter on top, not only was it pretty but also a great crispy texture that's needed. 
~ This was a very interesting dish with all of the different flavor and texture like spicy chili, crispy fritters, fatty soft tuna and sweet cool refreshing watermelon.

Spicy Tuna Avocado Tartare
~ Love the crispy tuna served on top of a crispy rice cake.... it's like a deep fried sushi ;)
~ This was so good, I guess I can eat just the df rice cake all day. 

Spicy Peruvian Style Ceviche
~ white snapper, clams, mussels, calamari, Aji Amarillo chili, fresh lime juice

  Asian Style Atlantic Salmon Cravlax
~ Japanese omelette, horseradish lemon & chive creme fraiche, marinated salmon roe
~ This was probably the only thing that we didn't like from the bento box, really don't understand the choice of the soft dough-y pancake here which took over all the texture and taste of the salmon. 
~ Wish it was served on a lighter or slightly crispy base.

 Braised Spiced Short Ribs $22
~ black garlic, truffled parsnip puree, roasted rosemary duck fat potato
~ This was the only dish we order on top of the Bento Box and it was melt in you mouth goodness. 
~ The rib was braised so soft and flavorful and love how light the truffled was which didn't overpower the puree at all.
~  The sauce was thick and delicious, the Chinese in me was craving for a bowl of steam rice to go with it. And need I say more, it's duck fat potato... yummmmmm

 Dinner ends with complementary desserts w/ a Mango Panna Cotta topped with tapioca and a Strawberry Rhubarb & Lemon Curd Parfait. The Panna Cotta was more like the Chinese mango pudding you get at dim sum but packed with real mango flavor which I love and the sesame crisp on the side was to die for. And love the refreshing parfait to end the meal.

Verdict :
~ No one does Asian fusion cuisine better than Susur Lee
~ I really enjoy my meal here
~ Great Food, Great Value, Great Service, Great Atmosphere
~ The Ben-O Special last until June 8th, so only a few more days left."}
{"text":"Back in November, I had the pleasure of trying out Bent's $35 BENT-O Part II special with three friends. I am usually not the greatest fan of Asian fusion, but had heard a lot of great things about Bent and their first BENT-O. Our server recommended us to share the BENT-O as an appetizer platter and order a few other things on the side, and that is exactly what we did. In hindsight, I would have been happy just having the BENT-O all for myself as my meal. 

Now onto the food!

The following were included in the BENT-O:

Lobster bisque with shrimp ravioli with squash mousseline- This was the only component that I did not enjoy. The lobster bisque was too salty, and the salt overwhelmed everything else.

Steamed braised beef bao with wild mushroom and leeks -an interesting twist on one of my favourite dim sum items - char shiu bao! I thought it was an ingenius idea to fill it with braised beef, and this was one of my favourite things in the BENT-O.

Peruvian ceviche shooter with purée of herbed artichoke - personally not a big fan, kind of tasted like salsa.

Oyster Rockefeller Gratinée - bacon, crabmeat, spinach - this was also delicious!

Tuna and Watermelon ceviche- shaved red onion, cilantro, crispy shallots, fresh citrus juice, Rocoto chili, Chinese Doughnut fritter. Tuna and watermelon turned out to be surprisingly good matches. The ceviche was light and refreshing, and the Chinese Doughnut fritter added a great crunch. 

Kale and tofu salad- sesame dressing and prickly ash. I was also impressed by this simple salad - all the components worked well together and the sesame dressing was very tasty.

Susur's Jerk spiced octopus- spiced pineapple and sweet potato. We almost couldn't tell that it was octopus on the skewer- it was surprisingly tender!

We also ordered...

Lobster taco ($16) - Chipotle charred onion tomato salsa, mango, avocado, taro shell. The lobster tacos came highly recommended by our server, and it did not disappoint! The taco might be small, but it packed a lot of flavours.

Braised spiced short ribs ($24) - truffled parsnip purée, roasted rosemary duck fat potato, sour cream, chives, black garlic, confit tomato . To my knowledge, the braised short ribs are one of the greatest hits at Bent, so obviously we had to try it too. The short ribs were luxuriously rich and melt-in-your-mouth tender- exactly how I want my short ribs to be. For me, the best part was the truffled parsnip purée.

Roasted scallop with sundried tomato crust ($25) - buckwheat rice cake, tarragon butter sauce. I thought the crust was an interesting element, but on the whole this was not as memorable as the other dishes we had. Note that only two scallops sat atop rice cakes, so two of us (myself included) did not get to try any rice cake. 

Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Bent and I would highly recommend the BENT-O special. . Asian fusion is not very often done successfully, but Bent manages to deliver in this regard."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, on the pricy side and not quite as memorable as Lee. The décor was lovely as well"}
{"text":"Singaporean slaw. That's all.

Nahhh just kidding. There's more to this restaurant than their bomb slaw, like their Vietnamese ceviche. But seriously, slaw was super yummy. The waiter was super friendly and made some great recommendations for drinks. We had the house special cocktail.. don't remember what was in it but it was stiff but delicious."}
{"text":"The second of my Winterlicious 2016 stops! The food was exactly what we expected - elevated, complementary and absolutely beautiful to look at. Can't wait to come back to sample some things from the full menu!"}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday at this fine restaurant and it was absolutely delicious. I started off the evening with the signature Singaporean slaw. HIGHLY RECOMMEND, actually it is a must have! The 19 ingredients are perfectly paired and each create an essential flavour to the slaw. Its crunchy, sweet and salty. The perfect blend of flavours. 
I also ordered the Jerusalem artichoke. The artichokes were delicious, especially when paired with the goat cheese and pumpkin seeds. To finish off the evening I had the pulled beef and braised onion peeking crepe. When deciding on a meat dish I asked the waiter what he recommended and he suggested the beef crepe and i'm glad I listened, it was flavourful, and seasoned perfectly. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant. It is great for date night, special occasions or group outing."}
