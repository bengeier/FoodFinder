{"text":"Consistently the best Italian food I've had in Toronto! I've worked my way through about a third of the menu so far, and I've rarely been disappointed. The wait staff are also highly courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"I use to love this place went 2x a week but it's gone down hill very bad I got a ponzo and I had to send it back twice because they got my order wrong I asked for a basic panzo and sauce on the side and the sauce on the side was raw!!!! Not Italian at all  so disappointed I asked for a meatball for my 1 year old and they said one small meatball was $3.50 ........ Horrible it was undercooked. I will never go back and I will make sure I tell everyone I know save your money and spend it some place with good quality food!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous.. Its over priced ..extremely over priced ..and the waitresses DO NOT GET TO KEEP THEIR TIPS ..which is illegal.. And just morally wrong ...NEVER TIP"}
{"text":"As soon as I entered, the host asked if I want the lunch buffet special or dinner.  I have certain allergies, so to be on the safe side, I went with the dinner option. I ordered the Sausage and green pepper pasta... it came out slightly undercooked, but they immediately came up and asked how I liked it. I told them it's slightly undercooked.  The waiter instantly apologized and had it cooked to my liking. I didn't see any green peppers, but the sausage really was tasty (and spicy), and the sauce was yummy as well. The service was fast, relatively attentive, and I was left content. I would have given it 5 stars if they wrote down my allergies (and not asked me twice if I wanted cheese - one of my more serious allergies) and I had seen the green peppers described."}
{"text":"we order a take out from this restaurant and I would say the food was packed very good to avoid any leakage and to keep it warm.

I ordered Penne or Fettucine Salmone which is Pasta with smoked salmon, pink sauce and herbs....The food was hot and tasty. The smell of fish was still there but it was quite good. The quantity was quite good and I could not finish it in one go. 

Decent food---lot of choices on the menu!"}
{"text":"I'm not so jolly about this place. 

My brothers a massive fan so I'v given it a try three times now. 
When you walk in you get the feel of an old family run Italian place. There's plenty of seating and parking outside. 

Food quality is good but taste doesn't do it for me. I'v had the chicken parm and their whole wheat vegetable pasta. I hauteur Cafe latte, which was great!  Service is a little slow and the server knocked over my coke a bit. I placed my napkins over it but he never bothered cleaning it up any further and didn't give new napkins. 

They do have a cute little patio with a perfect view of the parking lot."}
{"text":"Went here for the $4.95 draft beer special for Saturdays ad was denied that since they said it starts at 2pm and we got there at 12. Each beer was $8.......

We were hungry so looked at the menu. They are charging basically $30 for a fricken pizza for 2!!! We decided to go for the hot table. I ordered the chicken forestiera with potatoes and vegetables and my man ordered a meatball sandwich and fries. The chicken lunch was  $10.50 (charged me 50 cents extra for another piece of chicken....), sandwich was 6.95. Now to our further dismay the fries came.  Guess what?? SIX DOLLARS FOR FRIES!!!!!!!!!!! 
OK. So I'm done.  This place is absolutely ridiculous. The prices are insane. I would recommend you go anywhere else because we will not be returning. Lunch ended up to be $43 which included 2 drinks. I complained about the $6 fries and she said, \"that's the price Bella!!\". Never again. These wops can keep their old food to themselves and rip off someone else to make their overpriced rent. 

Not us, and hopefully not you."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for 10 years, and this is a really good spot in an otherwise bleak strip mall, the only place to get decent food at Crossroads.
The pastas are pretty good, and so are the pizzas. I used to get the lamb shank but that was too inconsistent, so now I almost always get the risotto. They do a pretty decent job of it, particularly the mushroom risotto. The seafood version uses frozen seafood, so the texture is a bit lacking, but you can't really expect fresh at these prices. For dessert they have a selection of homemade gelatos, and my kids tell me that Donatello is the best.
Definitely beats eating at the golden arches!"}
{"text":"The Chicken Sandwich is using frozen chicken Brest pieces, not fresh. The lasagna is chalky, and tastes like they used frozen meat sauce, as it has a bland taste so never mind the prices, it's awful.  California Sandwiches does the same price, yet their ingredients are all fresh, and cooked properly, not a microwave."}
{"text":"They have generous portions. Our server(I think he was the owner) was very attentive. The decor is very nice. The prices are reasonable. The booth we sat in was comfortable. The washrooms are decent, but need a little updating."}
{"text":"I would make the argument that the food on the hot table is inedible and borderline unsafe for human consumption. Using that as a reference point I didn't learn my initial lesson and ordered off the menu. Marginally better buy infinitely worse price to value ratio. Not really sure why this place exists, but it does. Can't even execute a decent spaghetti pomodoro. Benchmark for bad Italian cuisine."}
