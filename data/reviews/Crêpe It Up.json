{"text":"Had the Paris x, the ice cream was really rich, crepe well made and there wasn't to much of anything. Well done"}
{"text":"This was my first Canadian crepe as I arrived in Toronto. I had the Dark Angel crepe with ice cream. Coming from the Bay and having tasted Sophie's Crepes (the best in the Bay), this place was subpar. 

The crepe itself was toasty meaning it was a little crunchy which was fine with me. However, others may not like that. Anyways, it was good nothing too spectacular about it.

Overall, a thumb up!"}
{"text":"So good, adorable place, crepes are great. I like the banana/peanut butter/chocolate one, haven't tried a savoury one but I'm gonna!"}
{"text":"Crepe, crepe, crepe it up! I needed a crepe while I was in Canada last week (yes, I said needed) and I trusted all of you fellow Yelpers to help me pick a place, and as always, you did not disappoint. 4 Stars is a perfectly accurate rating, as the food is great and the service is \"eh\" at best. My sweet tooth and I ordered the chocolate-chip and banana crepe, and it was a lot like eating chocolate chip pancakes, but with just a hint of peanut butter. I am a peanut butter fiend and I definitely could have used more of the peanut butter and less of the chocolate chips, but hey, you live and learn, amiright?! Don't get me wrong, it was very good, but with all the unique options at Crepe It Up, I definitely dropped the ball on my crepe choice. I should have chosen the peanut butter and jelly crepe, and yes, I am still kicking myself over it a whole week later. My girlfriend went the savory route, as she always does, and chose the eggs Benedict crepe...she loved it! As I mentioned earlier, the service was highly disappointing; the cashier was particularly dry and unhelpful and the food took an usually long time to arrive. Also, I ordered a cafe mocha and ended up with a hot chocolate...so there's that. Despite these pitfalls, however, I would absolutely, 100%, go back to Crepe it Up next time I'm in Canada--and I think that says a whole lot about how great these crepes really are!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for fairly priced, pretty good crepes in downtown Toronto, this is it. Menu has a large selection of sweet and savoury crepes. Service is relatively quick (5-10min). Portions are generous, always leaving me full at the end. I've tried the ham and cheese crepe and the paris (fruit) crepe: both are delicious. The crepes themselves are hit or miss, sometimes I find them to be overcooked but usually they're just right. 

This place has a chill atmosphere and is clean. There's local artwork displayed on the walls for sale which is nice to look at. Lots of natural light in this restaurant/cafe. They have coffee and tea, plus pastries so if you're looking for a quick bite to eat I'd recommend Crepe It Up. Overall, I give this place 3 stars: it's by no means amazing but it does the job, at a pretty decent price."}
{"text":"This place is a total gem. From the delicious  multigrain bagels, crepes, maple syrup waffles to the cakes .. It is all mouth watering. I come here multiple times a week as I can't help myself! The staff is awesome, and the owner is more than friendly. Would definitely recommend checking this place out :)"}
{"text":"I've been to crepe it up quite a few times since it's a short walk from my place. I love crepes and it's where I go to get my fix. I recommend the sweets crepes over the savoury crepes. I've tried the banana Nutella crepes and they're great. A bit too sweet, probably recommend sharing it with another person. The savoury crepes are not too bad but the crepe covering is not the most flavourful. The prices are very affordable and the ambience is really nice. I'm definitely going back there"}
{"text":"This is the best crepe store in Toronto, and far beyond!! I've never been to a crepe shop that uses such fresh and good quality ingredients esp at this price. 
Their batter is so crispy outside and soft inside. I recommend seafood crepe for savory (they use good crab meat, not cheap crab sticks), and dulce de leche for sweet (store made quality caramel)
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a cute little cafe with art and a simple but delicious menu! The crepes are fantastic as are the desserts on display. The pricing is also fair, probably one of the better dessert cafes in the area I've found so far. The service varies - some staff are super friendly and others a bit aloof. I come back here regularly and take advantage of the Vicinity program to get free coffees and crepes :) So far my favourites are the Paris X crepe and the cakes."}
{"text":"Okay, this place is AMAZING. 
The place looks like a school cafeteria, the place is small, but WHO CARES?

1) The crepes are AMAZINGLY GOOD (I went to cafe crepe afterwards cus i couldn't NOT eat  crepe, they damaged my taste buds with their thick, pancake-like crepes) 

2) They are CHEAP. (I paid 6dollars for coffee + crepe. I paid 10 at cafe crepe, i guess the portion was bigger there but it didn't taste good)

3) The staffs are nice.

4) Tips are optional! Although i always tip them cus the food is too good not to tip :D"}
{"text":"Like fresh bugs with your crepes?!  Then this place is for you!

My husband and I have walked by this place all the time and decided to go today.

The cashier/server was very helpful in the beginning.  She recommended that I get the Paris (nutella and banana) and the Thai (condensed milk and banana) for my husband.

We got our crepes and returned to our table.  I took a bite -- delicious!  And then I saw a live, crawling bug on my plate.  Not sure if it came from under the crepe or was just on the plate.  I took it up to the cashier/server and explained there was a live bug on the plate and that I can't eat it.  She seem nonplussed.  

I appreciate that bugs can be found in many establishments, but I don't want them on  my plate.  I also expect a refund or at least some concern or appreciation for the situation.  There was none.  Instead she acted as if she didn't understand what I was saying."}
{"text":"The savory crepes were amazing. I was shocked that I liked the savory crepes because elsewhere weren't as good. Anyway, I'm not a fan of paying tip if I am not being served but I had to leave some tip after I finished eating because it was so good! I was going to give 4 stars but this is the best savory crepe place apart from London! I thought the price was inexpensive, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The crepes were delicious and reasonably priced. The staff was great too. I wish I didn't leave 400 miles away because our family would eat there more often."}
{"text":"Came here with husband on a Sunday afternoon. I decided to come after seeing the great reviews on Yelp. 

Usually, I go into a place with little to no expectations. However, when ordering the market crepe - Peking chicken, I couldn't help but have SOME expectations that it will include the ingredients on the menu. 

Granted, I wasn't expecting a full blown crispy skin & succulent chicken, but what I ended up with was subpar. The hoisin sauce was there. Pieces of chicken (dried, cubed, and not very tasty breast pieces) were there. But instead of the green onion written on the menu (which would complement this combo well) I was given a lot of regular diced onions. Ew... Neither of us touched the onion. 

When my husband asked whether they were out of green onions, the girl says they've never carried green onions. And she took a pen out and crossed out the word \"green\" on my husband's menu. @_@

My husband ordered the Monster crepe (mushrooms, spinach, broccoli, cheese, tomato, ham) and it was tasty. He enjoyed it. I had a few good bites. It was decent to good. 

We decided to order one sweet and went with Dark Angel. The girl overcharged us and we had to show her the price on the menu again. @_@
The guy who also works there was on a short break but came over to fix things. Very nice of him. 

The Dark Angel was delicious. So we ended on a better note. 

I think I would come back again, but it's definitely not a 5-star experience for me."}
{"text":"The crepes were awesome. Very generously sized and everything was very fresh. Our only complaint was that the tables were very small and too close together but the crepes were worth it"}
{"text":"Very affordable crepes (we ordered 2 and paid $10.05 for them). I've never had crepes before, so wasn't sure what to order. I wanted something different, so I asked the cashier if she liked the Bermuda Triangle. She admitted she'd never tried it, but I went ahead and ordered it anyway. The Bermuda Triangle is peanut butter and bacon. I could hear the woman making the crepes ask the cashier what ingredients went into the Bermuda Triangle!

Yep, \"different\" sure describes my crepe. Probably good for a peanut butter and bacon crepe, but not a taste I've ever had before. Also ordered the egg and ham and spinach crepe. Nice too. And a big ol' slice of strawberry rhubarb pie. Haven't had a real slice of pie like that in a long time. 

No table service: you pick up your food from the service area, get your own cutlery, and return the dishes to the counter. I'm sure that's what keeps the prices down.

Love the look of the restaurant. Open windows onto Church St. meant the noise was a little high. Will be coming back because it's so affordable, and nice inside."}
{"text":"I love the crepes here!! They are fabulous. I've only had the dessert ones though. Coffee is good too :) I always go here to get my crepe fix."}
{"text":"Longed for something sweet. 
Ordered dark angel and tiramisu.
Fair price and large potion.
The dark angel is amazing. The chocolate, crepe and ice cream mixed so well together.
Tiramisu is ok. The point is it is huge.
I love the place, stayed here for two hours. I even fell asleep."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious crepes and coffee! There are so many options under 5$, and they're very accomodating. Great date place."}
{"text":"My friend got ice cream at Baskin Robbins while I ordered a crepe here. She was staring at my crepe pretty hard and was full of regret for not getting dessert here instead. I let her have a couple of bites even though I was dying a little inside. It was that good."}
{"text":"The best crepes in Toronto. Both sweet and savoury are excellent. Great prices. I love their vanilla ice creme. Dark Angel and Monster are to die for. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"SOOOO good. 

I had a 'build-your-own crepe, with condensed milk and strawberries. 

IT. WAS. BOMB. I licked the container clean. lol.

It was cool to see that they had so many savory options and lunch specials. The staff was nice, had fresh baked goods out (the brownie was still hot in the plastic fresh), and had seating for about 20 people.

Cute lil spot. If I lived in TO i'd go all the time."}
{"text":"I've been creping it up for the past few weeks, sampling crepes from all over the city. 

Just in the past weeks I've been to Choco crepe, Crepe Delicious, Crepes a Go Go, my own kitchen even!, and now Crepe it Up :D

Environment:

Looks like a cute coffee shop to chill at. Not too large, there are 3 small round tables on far end, a bar stool setup for lined seating, and a couple more tables along the edge near the front entrance. Chalkboard menu and a pretty good selection of teas and coffees. 

Experience:

Today we tried a crepe, called the Paris. (Chocolate hazelnut spread, banana, and scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side) and chinese breakfast tea, although it was 6 o'clock in the evening lol 

We dug into the crepe, whoa I was surprised. This was great pairing of ingredients. It was delicious!   The crepe itself was soft and moist, sort of like a pancake flavour, not so eggy.

We enjoyed the crepe so much we ordered up another one called the Mexico which was sliced apple + Crème De Leche (caramel). Jeez after trying a few bites this too was another hit. The fresh sliced red apples were razor thin, and the caramel glaze providing a warm yummy coating to counter any tartness. 


Summary:

The crepes were perfect. On top of this they were not that expensive (under $5)

Recommend!"}
{"text":"My 7yo son loved the chocolate hazelnut crepe so much that he insisted I yelp about it immediately. Only complaint: no Amex"}
{"text":"Got a caramel crepe and a french vanilla. The crepe was really good. Perfect if you haven't had dinner already, but I ate already before coming and so it was a bit too much to finish. The drink was water and it felt like it's made from those office coffee machines; I expected more."}
{"text":"I go Crepe it Up very often. Unfortunately they raised the price for crepe recently. I tried most of sweet crepes and I liked most of them. I liked Thai, which were coming with banana and condensed milk. It was very good. The picture of the cafe looks bright, but inside is not bright."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I am a regular here. 

Food: The coffee is my favorite in the gaybourhood. It changes a bit in flavour, but the quality is consistent, which I really like plus its less pricey than Starbucks etc. They also make the espresso-based drinks, which is nice on the days when I need a little extra kick to get me going. They have an ever-changing and delicious selection of baked goods, most of which I believe is made on-site. Cookies, muffins, croissants, apple strudels, cakes, butter tarts, cheesecakes, baklava, and the list goes on ($1-3). There are usually sandwiches ($3-5 )and lunch specials, and soups and things as well. ... Last but not least, there are the crepes ($4-9). A different style than Crepes-a-Gogo, but equally delicious.  I've tried about 10 different ones and loved them all. The Monster (sans broccoli) is my ultimate hangover cure!! 

Atmostphere: Coffee shop. I've seen the energy level vary from being subdued and perfect for a quiet afternoon reading in the sun, to almost boisterous with every seat taken. I've always found the service to be quite good, but I adore the staff and am totally biased. To that end, I think what makes this place awesome is that there are a lot of regulars, everyone is friendly. There's a nice community vibe that you dont always find in the big city. 

If youre in the area, it's a great place for coffee, lunch, or something sweet. I have so much love for this place!"}

*Wifi for customers 

I decided to check out Cafe by Crepe it Up for coffee and dessert after my delicious lunch at Ginger (which is my ultimate spot for bowl of pho!). Cafe by Crepe it Up is a nice little coffee place on Church Street with big windows and bright lighting.

They sell lots of different items for such a small coffee shop varying from sweet & savory crepes, sandwiches, pastries, cookies, pie, hot beverages and coffee beans. It's always nice to see so much variety at coffee shops because sometimes you just crave something different and new. They also have fresh squeezed orange juice and house-made sandwiches that can be grilled for you if you wish. You can purchase Fair Trade Organic Coffee beans at Cafe by Crepe it Up for around $16.50/lb

Ordered: DARK ANGEL 5/5
*Hazelnut Chocolate Crepe wrapped around Vanilla Ice Cream Ball for $4.95
*As soon as you order at the front, they told me there would be 7 minute wait
*They make the crepe on the spot right after you put in the order
*Such a steal for what you get, the crepe is huge and it's only five dollars
*Crepe is thin and chewy, just like it's suppose to be (not doughy, like the one at Wandas)
*Ends are crispy with lots of rich hazelnut chocolate filling inside
*This was like heaven in my mouth, I could literally see angels flying around
*Only downside is that the icecream melts super fast cause it's wrapped in hot, fresh crepe
*It could get pretty messy to eat
*Perfect for Dessert (might be too much for 1 person, but you really don't want to share this)

Ordered: MOCHACCINO 3/5
*Huge mug of Americano with hint of chocolate for $4.25
*This is perfect for a cold day
*It wasn't too sweet but it had hint of chocolate aftertaste which I loved
*This was perfect with my Dark Angel crepe and complimented the chocolate filling very well
*If I had to compare it, it was kind of like watered down hot chocolate with bitter coffee taste

There were lots of students having lunch here, ordering their savory crepes which I can't wait to try next time I am there. The only down side is that they only have 1 person making the crepe so if the place is busy, your crepes will take long but it's def worth the wait. Also, their specials change everyday and they seeemed to have lots of regulars picking up coffee or sweet pastries from the shop.

Summary: I've been back to Cafe by Crepe it Up couple times after my first visit but had same thing ever single time I was there. Normally, I go for Savory crepes but Dark Angel is really that good. If you are ever on Church street, Cafe by Crepe is Up is def worth the visit."}
{"text":"I come here often with my friends for crepe and coffee. It can get busy and sometimes the wait is longer than expected but my crepe (Montreal crepe) is always delish!  If I feel for something sweet, they have that covered as well with lots of choices. Nice spot for a break :)"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place...I mean the Yelp pics made it look bigger and cleaner. IRL, it was kind of dingy and dirty with flies hovering around the free water jug that looked like it had been sitting there a while above the recycling bin. 

The view outside wasn't too great even though it was a nice summer night. Just a lot of run down neon signed places on Church Street and inside were sour looking patrons sitting alone hogging an entire large table.

The crepes were decent - I had the Thai (bananas with condensed milk) that was pillowy, sweet-but-not-too-sweet and filling. I guess it lost some taste points knowing that it came out of a cruddy looking kitchen and the staff made it grumpily. This place could use a scrub and then I'd be happy to go back again for the crepes."}
{"text":"Really tasty crepes for dessert.  Also tried out their spinach pie,  which was great.  Tiramisu was decent.  Great atmosphere and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Would give this place a 4.5 stars actually. 
We ordered the monster crepe, BLT and egg sandwich and a strawberry, banana, mango fruit shake. 
The actual crepe itself is very nice and crisp, not too sweet but not bland. The amount of fillings they give in the crepe makes it very worth it, in my opinion. 
The sandwich, is actually an everything bagel with I like a lot, because I love everything bagels. Stacked inside was a whole fried egg, lettuce, tomato and very crispy bacon, which is so awesome. 
The fruit shake is not overly sweet, which is great, almost tasted like there was no extra sugar added. 

The cafe itself is very cozy and quiet. Perfect for catching up with some friends! The cafe is decorated with I believe local artists painting that you may buy. It is suggested that you do clear your own table as they have some bins near the garbage where you can place your dishes. 
Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful crepes at a reasonable cost of $8 to 18, depending on size and toppings.  In old Quebec City"}
{"text":"Went with a friend.  He only wanted something to drink.  All of the sodas in the cooler were warm, I wanted food, they feature shepherd's pie and some Italian soup. They did not have either one.  I had the hot chix crepe.  It had broccoli but they used the stems and they were raw and tough.  It  took them 20 minutes to make it and it wasn't busy.  What a shame, a great location and lousy food and staff who doesn't  have a clue."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to live near here and this was a frequent stop for us for good, quick, delicious food. There are crepes of all kinds: salad, savoury and sweet. They also have some other items like quiche, pastries and good coffee. 

It's a nice place to go and do some work or read. During the Summer their glass wall open to the street. 

If you want you crepe spiced up-ask for it! They can put it into anything, no extra charge. My fav is the tuna crepe. Hubby loves the veggie one. 

They also are part of the Vicinity network so you can earn points toward free items."}
{"text":"Breakfast is slow and mediocre. Do not recommend. They actually don't have one of the menu items listed on their breakfast menu. For about 16 a person, it's kind of like sunset grill. I got a salmon eggs Benedict that was lukewarm and drenched in hollandaise. Bread was overbuttered as if it were cupcake icing. Overall a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"This is the best place for crepes, and I am not even a fan of crepes. They make the best dulce de leche crepes, and I always have a great time with friends. The customer service is excellent, and the price is great!"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly good, and decently filling crepes for the price it's sold at. 

I went with a friend and we split an Eggs Benedict and Paris crepe. We both preferred the eggs Benedict one. While they were both good, the Paris one (filled with banana and hazelnut chocolate) was a little more basic. The crepe itself was a little more on the doughy, chewy side, but the flavour was still great. 

Overall, food didn't take too long, and was flavourful and filling. It was surprisingly pretty empty and spacious for the good deal of crepes. With the spacious table set-up, big windows letting in natural lighting (good photo opp), and relaxed vibes, I would definitely bring a friend along with me again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and loved it both times! The crepes are delicious and very reasonably priced, and the coconut cake is heavenly! Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Came back to try the Eggs Benedict Crêpe because some of the pictures looked so irresistibly delicious. As you can see my hollandaise came out looking like yellow lumpy DIARRHEA and was heavily seasoned. I had to scrape off the pitiful excuse for a hollandaise just to eat my crêpe which was soft & mushy from the sauce. At least the spinach, mushroom & ham filling was fine. I'm gonna stick with their sweet crêpes from now on. So far they haven't ruined that for me.  I hope in the future they hire people with some sense of quality control."}
{"text":"Dark Angel - before and after. 
Need to come back to try the other choices. 
Super friendly staff - very accommodating. Gave us spoons for the last tastes so we didn't have to lick the plate."}
{"text":"Shared the Vanity Fair waffle and veggie crepe.. couldn't decide which I liked better- both were delicious. Nice relaxing atmosphere"}
{"text":"Go for the crepes, not the coffee.

I went with a friend, and we each ordered a crepe. I had the Dark Angel - a crepe with chocolate hazelnut and ice cream in the middle. These flavours naturally go quite well together, and were well matched by the crispy freshness of the enveloping crepe.

We both ordered drip coffee - it was late on the evening so I suspect the brew must have been old because it tasted terrible. Not worth your money. I decided not to down our for this however, assuming that most people are only interested in the crepes."}
{"text":"The monster crepe is my favourite. This is my go to place for savoury crepes~. The dessert crepes are also good. There's plenty of seating and the decor is very nice :)"}
{"text":"Hands down the, yes THE best crepe in Toronto. I had crepes for breakfast in Paris, Tokyo and Seoul so I know good crepes when I get a bite. This place is comparable to all these great crepes places in Paris. This is one of few places in Toronto I can recommend without a single moment of hesitation. 

There's a good harmony between each ingredients and they're wrapped in thin, crispy crepe sheet. They NAIL it.

I'm surprise to see all these negative comments about their staffs, as I never encountered unpleasant service (yet) 
In fact, every each visit I was noticed with their pleasant greeting with big big smile!

Either way, that won't stop me from coming here. I do care about staff's attitude and sometimes it does stop me from going to certain places repeatedly but this place serves such solid crepes, I could careless about getting smile or not."}
{"text":"Finally a decent place for crepes. Crepes are a delicate item that require a balance to get things right. Many spots I tried in Canada had either the batter wrong or the stuffing ratio was off (exception being the a crepe chain I tried in Quebec city). This place does a decent version. I had the apple with cinnamon and DC had the mixed berry. The crepes were made to order and the brought over. I did try the berry crepe as well though didn't get a feel for it. 
My order of crepe was simple yet good. The batter had nice chewy delicate feel. The filling didn't overwhelm and the portion wasn't a monstrosity. Good spot to get one's crepe fix. I will be back.
3.5 stars
P.S. the promo for Yelp check in isn't accepted here."}
{"text":"My son and I are unanimous on this one. We ordered a Montreal and a Dolce De Lece and the Montreal was the best tasting one (for a breakfast).

Food was great, I will come back!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice interior and friendly service. Theres great lunch deals and coffees to pair along side it. Prices are very fair, and in summer they open up front completely which is very nice."}
{"text":"I've been here pretty often because of its fresh, cheap, and delicious crepes. I also enjoy the atmosphere of the place, as its a small trendy little cafe with a garage door style patio. The staff there is also very friendly and welcoming. From the sweet and savoury crepe menu i've tried the apple cinnamon, banana cinnamon, paris, and breakfast crepes. The crepes have a great crispy and thin texture, with a good crepe to filling ratio. Also depending on the worker,they caramelize their fillings! I suggest for you to ask for cooked fillings as it makes a huge difference! Their waffles are okay, while their ice cream is a about average. All in all if you want a cheap, and fresh snack, brunch or lunch option with a patio come here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The crepes are delish! I love the veggie crepe, very reminiscent of the crepes in Paris. My husband and I are regulars and we get the crepe with their homemade hazelnut-chocolate spread (like Nutella) with walnuts layered on top. Very yummy and we get 2 crepes for about $8! Great for a cheap, fun, Saturday breakfast. The food does vary slightly depending on who makes it... sometimes the walnuts are whole, sometimes they're chopped... either way they're delicious, so I don't care. :)"}
{"text":"This is a nice spot on Church Street if you want something more for breakfast than the typical eggs, bacon, toast. I had the eggs Benedict crepe and the spinach and mushrooms were cooked really nicely. My main complaint is that the smoked salmon didn't taste great, almost more like salmon from a can then smoked salmon. The hollandaise had a nice flavor, albeit it was slightly watery in consistency. The crepe itself was lovely, with a slightly sweet flavor to it. My girlfriend had the western bagel sandwich and enjoyed it as well, she had no complaints. This place wasn't groundbreaking, but it's definitely a place to try. I did find the prices a bit high, and the staff was friendly but seemed to be a little disorganized. I will probably come here again next time I'm in the area but I would definitely try one of their sweet crepes."}
{"text":"Had the chocolate hazelnut and walnut crepe with pistachio ice cream added (extra $2 I think), which was SO good. Good balance between the chocolate hazelnut spread and crepe. Sometimes I find some places go overboard with the chocolate spread and you can't taste the crepe as much. Not here though. Now I'm craving some crepes."}
{"text":"The prices can't be beat, but the crepes just don't do it for me. I came here last week on the recommendation of Yelp, and got a smoked salmon benedict crepe as well as a Paris crepe (chocolate, banana and whipped cream - I declined the ice cream which is the alternative to whipped cream).

I found that the flavours in the benedict crepe did not complement each other. The smoked salmon didn't go well with the sauce, and the overall savory-ness of the filling didn't mesh with the sweetness of the crepe. The crepe was also very soggy and did not hold the filling well.

The Paris crepe was pretty yummy, but it's hard to go wrong with sugar and carbs. This crepe too was soggy, which really took away from the taste.

I would probably come back here for a sweet crepe due to the price, but since I threw away most of the savory crepe, I don't think I would come back for a meal."}
{"text":"Pretty solid crepe and received what I expected with a strawberry/nutella crepe.They have a bunch of other baked goods too, though I can say my friend's piece of cake that I sampled was not at its freshest. From my experience: stick to the crepes."}
{"text":"Gem in the village- the crepes are so light and tasty! The shop provides either savory or sweet crepes- I recommend the apple crepe- so full of flavor! Will return for another dessert..."}
{"text":"The general decour leaves a little to be desired.  Not the most cozy place.  BUT, you CAN\"T beat teh selction, the price or the awesome staff behind the counter.

All the crepes are delish, whether you are into savoury or sweet.  go with another person and get one of each to share!
And averaging 5$ a crepe, you can't beat that price.  really.
I'm so tired of cafe crepe raising their prices and tryingto be trendy.  Go here- they have an adorable little japanese boy behind the counter that will make you LAUGH and LAUGH allll evening while you are there.

oh, and they have an excellent espresso maker- what more could you want??"}
{"text":"Excellent crepe spot. I've traveled abroad and this is one of the best I've eaten at.  Ate here 3 times during my stay, I will definitely be back here when I'm in Canada again."}
{"text":"Fantastic crepes, and a great value. For $6-9, you get sweet/savory crepes
excellent breakfast choice on Church"}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends after dinner for dessert. It was a quaint little place and was surprised with all the different types of crepes. It wasn't a big place but enough to fit 7 of us with two round tables. We basically took up a 1/4 of the place.

The service was quick and attentive. The cashier was nice and friendly. I shared a Thai crepe and had a hot chocolate. The crepe was a nice size for a dessert and it was tasty. The hot chocolate on the other hand was warm and had way too much froth.

I wouldn't say it's the greatest place to bring a group but they were nice to accommodate us. I'm sorry to say that we were the only and loudest group and seemed to annoy some of the patrons. Some were there with their laptops staring at us. Oh well, I'm sure it'll come around - if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"The perfect Sunday no-cook, pick-up-your-order-in-pajamas, eat-takeout-on-the-couch-while-masochistically-powering-through-last-night's-SNL-even-though-it-hasn't-made-you-laugh-in-10-years breakfast.

You can curate your own crepes, but we usually order a couple of the standard savoury items - our favourites being the salmon Eggs Benedict, tuna and \"seafood\" (the most expensive offerings on the menu, all $7.85 each with tax). But the fruit ones are delicious too, for all y'all with sweet teeth. Either way, you get a big, fluffy, flavourful, very well-stuffed crepe that suffices as a light meal.

I'm not a fan of the Styrofoam takeout containers but the contents never disappoint.

P.S. It can be a bit of a wait if they're busy. Try not to ogle other patrons' chocolatey croissants and/or draw attention to your pajamas while you pass the time."}
{"text":"A great place for a crepe! Even though I have only been here once I still talk about how great their \"Hot Chick\" crepe is. After you order you can watch your crepe be made which wins Crepe It Up awesome points in my  books. 

The dining area is very small, and as other reviewers have noted the decor is lackluster, but the delicious food makes up for this. I recommend hitting this place up for lunch or a light afternoon snack."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! One of the best crepe places in Toronto hands down! I love the Dark Angel crepe. The crepe itself is crispy on the outside and soft in the inside yumm. Can't wait to try out more flavours! I'll definitely be back!
It's a great place to just chill and people watch!"}
{"text":"If you want reasonably priced, well made crepes, this is the place to go. If you also want a nice atmosphere with modern decor and lots of space, this is not the best place. Fortunately, I primarily care about food, so this place gets decent points in my books.

Been here 2 times and both times we ordered 3 crepes and 2 drinks. Comes out to be around $20 each visit. Each time we left feeling pretty happy. We had a variety of crepes like Dark Angel, chocolate hazelnut, and some things with fruits. All good! Good portion and nice decorating touches on the crepes. I've tried crepes at other places and I generally feel like I've been ripped off but here, I feel like it was worth it. 

Aside from crepes, they also sell breakfast stuff and some bakery goods. Haven't tried those and probably don't intend to. 

The decor isn't really terrible. It's just...plain. When it's busy, you might not have a lot of space to move either. It's open kitchen and the kitchen isn't much to look at."}
{"text":"Very good weekend breakfast place. The Hot Chick is a fantastic crepe, but the Hawaiian is often a bit flat - not enough filling."}
{"text":"A really cute spot in the Church and Jarvis area. 
Eggs Savoury Crepe (with Salmon) - this melted in my mouth. The hollandaise sauce was absolutely perfect! The only downside was that we waited a while to get our food during a weekday lunch hour."}
{"text":"I had a delicious crepe with hazelnut filling, almonds, vanilla ice-cream, and chocolate sauce. For a little over $6, it is quite a bargain and left me very satisfied.

I would recommend this great little place for dessert, although they do prepare savoury crepes, as well. They have a large selection of baked goods and a tea station set up against one of the walls. 

Don't forget to use your check-in offer, which gets you 15% off your bill!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite. First in line and it took ages to give our order and then even longer to get our food. Partway through waiting for our food two women walked in and the two employees chatted with them for awhile. Still no food. Then I was called over and told that there had been some issue with my order and so they will give us a free crepe with nutella/chocolate and powdered sugar. That's cool.

Finally get the food we had ordered. The crepes were overcooked. Maybe this was the issue? It was quite difficult to eat. Then the freebie came by. Also overcooked. Now I'm not sure what the issue was....? Seems to me that they just like to make crepes super hard (and difficult to eat).

Probably won't visit again for a long time, despite it being in the neighbourhood. Just not fun to think about having to saw through my crepes in order to eat it...."}
{"text":"There food for the price you pay is amazing; and they have a very good variety of desert and brunch. They also have a nice garage door style patio. Also a good place to take a date.

I would definitely go back again!!"}
{"text":"The crêpe tasted a bit too tough, definitely not like the real French ones. I did love the organic chocolate and the fact that the strawberries were heated up. The place is not that cosy and Wi-Fi did not work."}
{"text":"Oh wow. Could this crepe place be better than Crepes a gogo ? This might be very true. And what more is that it's got seating, a great place for dessert and coffee and it's open late. (Sunday night and we were there til 11 and it was still going strong)

I got a Paris crepe, chocolate and banana. It wasn't just nutella in there. The crepe was crispy on the edges and filled with chocolate sauce. It was 4.50. 
They also had savoury crepes on the menu too. 

I didn't get to try but there were also a myriad of fresh pastries and honey balls. 

My friend got a large latte and he loved it. 

It seemed like everything was made with TLC. 

Come for a sweet dessert or catch up with old friends."}
{"text":"Je pense que je suis tombée en amour avec ce café :')
Le temps d'attente était un peu long mais cela ne m'a plus dérangée après avoir reçu notre déjeuner tardif.
La nourriture était merveilleusement bonne et pas cher. Par contre, il est important d'attendre un bon 15 minutes avant de recommander si nous trouvons que ce que nous avons etait pas assez remplissant.

Parce que ça l'est !!!! Il m'aurait suffit d'une quiche, d'un gâteau au fromage et d'un chocolat chaud pour me remplir, mais jai été trop gourmande donc je me suis prise une crêpe montréalaise avec jambon fromage et oeufs. Unr chance que mon ami était là pour m'aider sinon je ne l'aurais pas fini....
En fait, j'ai été incapable de finir mon gâteau au fromage plein de gras et de calories mais oh combien delicieuse.
Nous sommes restés un bon trois heures. Les propriétaires ne font pas comme dans les restaurants habituels où l'on vous presse à partir après avoir mangé. Tout passe comme au ralenti, le temps semble s'arrêter pour vous permettre de vivre un moment mémorable en bonne compagnie...
C'est magnifique!!"}
{"text":"I think my friend found her go-to crepe location. It's simple, small, cheap, and she loved her strawberry and mozzarella cheese crepe. I ordered the chocolate and then after that I was feeling adventurous, I tried the Dulce De Leche, which was  a mistake. I pretty much went into anaphylactic shock right there in the store. Very sweet, tooooo sweet. But aside from that, the flavor of the crepes were excellent and they had an excellent crunch on the edges the way it should be. Not overly greasy, just the right amount of egg in the batter. We will definitely put this place on our list of sweet places to go after a meal."}
{"text":"After spending time in IKEA and fighting the Sunday traffic back into the city, we were exhausted and just needed a little coffee in the afternoon. 

After Crepe-It-Up finished their renovation in the summer I had not been in, and the newly reno'd space looks great ! It's a small space, but very inviting and comfortable and they use the small seating area well. Maybe 10 tables.

They expanded to the space next door, and all windows face the sidewalk/street, and during the summer, the door on the right rolls up, lots of natural light, and the space feels a little larger than it actually is . We sat at the bar facing the windows. Great spot even though it's right beside the front door, you don't feel squeezed in. 

I ordered a little white cookie (looked like a Mexican Wedding Cookie) with powdered sugar and a double espresso. The barista was very nice and multi tasking was her forte for sure ! 

The espresso was very nice. My friend's had tea, a baklava and a regular coffee. All was enjoyed by a chorus of mmmmm's.

I glanced at the menu and decided to come back here one week-end for breakfast. If you haven't noticed I seem to really enjoy breakfast places the last year. Don't know why, since I spent years not even eating breakfast.  The prices on all of the menu items looked very reasonably priced, and some very interesting crepe's.

A return visit is for sure called for !"}
{"text":"So I was in the mood for a decent breakfast today, and I was debating between Second Cup and McDonalds, but as I was walking towards Church and Wellesley, I saw Crepe It Up.  I've heard good things about this place so I decided to check it out and then check-in on Yelp. The Yelp app said 15% off but then I realized it was for students only and I'm no longer a student (that was almost a decade ago - man I feel old now).  However, they said since it was my first time, they would give me 15% off, which was totally awesome. Cool!

I saw they had a bunch of savoury crepes ranging for $6 to $8 and there was a breakfast crepe,  but it seemed really heavy.  So I decided on the Montreal crepe (egg, ham and cheese).  This was amazing.  The omelette like egg was fluffy, cheese was melted above the ham and the outside of the crepe was slightly crispy yet still fluffy.  Upon first bite, I was like \"OMG, this is so good\".  I also had a coffee and the total was just under $8. 

Not bad at all.  

So it was friendly staff, a cute little coffee shop with decent coffee and great crepes.  Super awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing cafe! The service is incredibly friendly and the food is to die for. Thus far this is the only place in Toronto that does crepes with proper Dulce de Leche from Argentina and not just a caramel sauce. The savory crepes are equally delicious and the staff is so kind that if you ask to split the cost they'll make the crepe differently such that you get the filling in two crepes that don't have as much dough but have all the delicious veggies and what have you. Five stars that are definitely deserved!"}
{"text":"Crêpe It Up is 1 of 2 reviews that I had not yet gotten around to writing, so I returned yesterday evening for another visit, and I think I will have to change my original rating. After not finding the location on my first try, I noted the address and returned a few weeks ago for breakfast. While not a crepe enthusiast, I figured it would be a nice treat based on some good reviews I had read. The restaurant inside has exposed brick, wood furniture, and some artwork that I guess is for sale as each piece has a price listed. There is an order counter and some displays with cakes and smaller pastries. It wasn't too busy by mid-morning, but many people came just for coffee to go. The service was rather indifferent, and this was the main reason I was originally going to give a 3-star rating, but yesterday's service was much better and also faster.

The menu has a lot of different sweet (fruits, cinnamon, chocolate hazelnut) or savoury crepes (egg, chicken, mushroom, vegetables), and also has an option to create your own. There is also has an assortment of waffles, and a wide selection of hot and cold drinks, including smoothies. On my first visit, I think I had an apple cinnamon crepe with a café mocha; yesterday I had the Paris crepe (chocolate hazelnut and banana with ice cream on the side) and an iced coffee as it was still hot in the evening. Both of the crepes were fine, a good size with lots of fruit inside, and the ice cream was very creamy. The café mocha was very good, and quite a large cup, although I found the iced coffee a bit strong. Each meal came to about $12, so a pretty good price I guess for crepes. As I said above, I'm not really a big crepe person, but I could see myself going back again to at least try one of the savoury versions."}
{"text":"Staff are rude. A huge downer to my first visit to Canada after lovely people elsewhere. No attempt to call your order again/louder if you are hard of hearing. On to the food. While the eggs Benedict crepe was good, with a yummy hollandaise sauce, the price was not. Including tip I paid almost $30 for rude service, a standard sized crepe and possibly the most mediocre London Fog I've ever tasted - watery and Stevia aftertaste. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I have had way better! Read great reviews for the place on yelp and went there. It's a nice cozy cafe type of ambience but the crepes were mediocre. The savory crepe had uncooked absolutely raw avacados !!! The Nutella hot chocolate was quite watery. It's a nice place to go one time but won't go there repeatedly."}
{"text":"This place is super cute. It's actually pretty big inside.

Came here post Fabarnak for some coffee and to go over how amazing fabarnak was. 

I had a soy latte. It wasn't something to write home about. The coffee tasted mad burnt.

We also had the honey balls..and they weren't my favourite either.

Have to come back again soon, and do the numi teas. Those looked amazing. Maybe even a crepe next time?"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Hot Chic\" as I was looking for the most popular chicken crepe. It was good but I wish it had a sauce of some sort. The menu listed \"spicy sauce\" on the menu but I definitely didn't taste any. Ask for tobacco or some sort of sauce if you're really looking for the \"hot\".
Filling and delicious regardless! Great portions!"}
{"text":"This was exactly what I was looking for when I was in the area - quick, filling and good food. If only I had consulted Yelp beforehand though so I could have taken advantage of the 15% off my order. Perhaps next time then! I ordered the Egg Benedict crepe with ham and found myself very full and satisfied after. I knew the crepe was hot and fresh because you can see them cooking it to order. The staff was very nice when I asked to scan my Vicinity Rewards card after the transaction because I had seen a sign hanging on the window while I was waiting for my order. They also seem to have a decent selection of coffees and baked goods. Glad to know that this place is in this neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Their gluten free crepes are super good. I loved them. I had the eggs Benedict crepe with a cup of coffee. And it was decently priced. The portions could be a bit bigger. I was hungry again after about an hour. But the flavour was nice. The lady at the cash where I ordered my meal didn't even know they had gluten free crepes which kinda freaked me out but the lady doing the cooking reassured me that there gluten free crepes were safe for me. Their tables are super small which makes it difficult for you to eat with a group larger than 2. I had to put my cup of coffee on the floor to make room. And the table I sat at was very unbalanced. But if you're ok with those small finds then head to this place. It's delicious."}
{"text":"The crepes are usually good, the coffee; a few times I've had to ask them to make it hotter, they don't make good cappuccinos at all. I would say my biggest concern is that they leave their baked goods like quiches and big pies just sitting out on the counter right next to the cash register, where anything can come in contact with them, like hair and dust and god knows what else. Several times, I've considered a piece of pumpkin pie, but it's sitting there all day collecting dust. A health code violation?

I had a nice quiche a few weeks ago that had a nice long hair residing in it. The next one I had the onions were almost raw and the broccoli was too hard, these should be cooked first and then added to the mix.

Often a lot of customers sitting for ages working on their thesis and taking up tables that could be used by other customers.

It has a great window and location for people watching, just get the crepes and no coffee and you'll be OK. They will also make crepes with the ingredients you want."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. We had spinach and mushroom, and Mediterranean omelette. They tasted really nice. We also had Dark angel crepe, and it was also amazing!"}
{"text":"The employee there was seriously clueless. My waffle was okay, and definitely do not like the chocolate they serve on the waffles and crepes."}
{"text":"This is my second time ordering a crepe here. The base of it is decent (not overly chewy/ thick) and the portion is good for the price. However, in both occasions, they went overboard w/ the topping. The dark angel was jam-packed w/ the spread (chocolate hazelnut), and the customized crepe had too much chocolate sauce. I had to keep scrapping some off since it made the crepe overly sweet & heavy."}
{"text":"Initially, when I walked into the restaurant, it was pretty crowded and thats when I knew this place must be good. But when I looked at the prices, I was little put-off; it wasn't exactly cheap but there must be a good reason for the popularity. The portions are fairly large and the crepes are DELICIOUS!! I really enjoyed the strawberry and chocolate hazelnut crepe, although very sweet, just know they do NOT skimp out on the nutella.

This place is great to just sit down, enjoy some good breakfast/brunch food, and catch up with your friends. The service is fairly decent considering how much customers they get! I do plan on coming back to try some of their savory crepes since the portions are hugee."}
{"text":"This place is relatively well priced and the portions are average-- I have the veg breakfast burrito at 7.95+tx. I expected a built more egg, he put in one egg and it was really more veggies than egg. My husband had the BLT &egg - it comes on a bagel - he said it was good, it didn't disappoint but it didn't exceed his expectations."}
{"text":"This is the best crepe joint in Toronto! 
They serve fresh crepes, and their savoury selection is actually delicious, -a first for most creperies. 

Service here is far above average. Our petite crepe 'artiste' -Tina, I believe, was extremely warm, friendly and hilarious. 

The crepes here can be taken as a dessert or as a complete meal under $10. My favourite crepes are the Hot Chick, Seafood and Tres Amigos. 

The very few locations are a travesty, but not a huge price to pay considering their firm grasp on quality."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop. The coffee is too dark for my taste... but their specialty drinks are delicious. Their crepes and waffles are scrumptious as well. 
One thing I find off putting is almost all of their sweets are from Costco... but the price does not reflect that one bit. 4.95 for a slice if Apple pie from Costco. No Thanks."}
{"text":"Great little place for breakfast. The savoury crepes trump the sweet crepes for breakfast protein purposes. I came here before work to grab a bite to eat. Quick and friendly service - the place was practically empty in terms of people eating in.

The coffee is good as well. A lot of people came in and ordered coffee to go.

I order the breakfast crepe. Everything was well balanced and the crepe itself was perfectly cooked with the right amount of ingredients in the crepe.

If you are a Chatime fan, you can collect points here as well as they are part of the Vicinity network."}
{"text":"A little late, but better late than never!  Wanting a sweet bite after dinner, my friends and I decided to check this place out.  I decided to get a piece of the tiramisu cake.  I didn't particularly care for it, but me being stupid should have opted for a crepe and shared with someone.  The crepes are made fresh and I'm sure that cake was obviously sitting there all day (and the day before maybe?)  and didn't taste what I expected tiramisu to taste like.

If you come here get the crepes for sure."}
{"text":"Great Crepe Place. The biggest reason I'm giving it a 5 star is because of the very fair prices (Sweet Crepes from $3-6 and Savourty crepes from $5-7). However even with these cheap prices, the crepes are delicious. They're not quite as humungo as places like I Feel Like Crepe on College but they're just as tasty.

I tried their Monster Crepe and white it was great, it just reminded me more of an omellete than a crepe. So I decided to go for the Dark Angel crepe (chocolate hazelnut crepe wrapped around a ball of ice cream) and it was absolutely perfect!

If you're looking for some crepes in this part of the city then Crepe It Up is definitely the place to be. I think they have another location at the St. Lawrence market too!"}
{"text":"I hadn't had a crepe in so long and this definitely hit the spot. People tend to lean more towards the sweet crepes, but the savory ones are just as good. The strawberry rhubarb pie and coffee were also delicious. Wonderful way to start off my morning."}
{"text":"Crepe is soooooo delicious...Great place for sweet lovers! Dont really love their coffee tho..."}
{"text":"The girl at the cashier was not very informative of their menu but the food was delivered to our table relatively quickly. A cute space to do a solo meal or meet w a friend for coffee/food. 

I ordered one of the market crepes. It had the exact texture I was looking for in a savory crepe; cheese was not overwhelming and gave a hint of saltiness. Mine also had egg, mushroom, spinach and some \"herbs\". 

Would come back if craving for a crepe! ;)"}
{"text":"Crepes gonna crepe. 
Le menu est immense.
Les crêpes sont délicieuses. LES GAUFRES SUCRÉES AUSSI. 

J'ai commandé une crêpe à l'avocat, y a des matins de même. Comme Mixmania, je n'ai eu AUCUN REGRET. Sauf les petits morceaux de tomate chaude, j'aime pas ben ça les tomates chaudes, mais peut-être que toi oui ! 

Ma blonde a pris une crêpe bénédictine. Cette sauce: cadeau des dieux. Seul hic, les champignons pas tout à fait cuits.

Le café? Acceptable. Pas de qualité supérieure mais le genre de café que tu bois chez ta chum Solange le dimanche après la messe pis que ça fait ben ton affaire même si c'est pas top. 

LE MEILLEUR? CETTE GAUFRE pleine de fruits et de chocolat et de crème fouettée oh wowowowow. Je n'ai pas eu le temps de prendre une photo, je l'ai engloutie. 

À ce resto y a des aînés, des travailleurs de la voirie, des jeunes professionnels, bref, tout le monde dit oui à une bonne crêpe / gaufre et on danse dans la rue ou presque. YEAH!"}
{"text":"the staff do not smile or even act like they care (sorry this means a lot)
the food is good but they don't fancy it up with any kind of garnish just a crepe with no trimmings
obviously they are not familiar with the term \"presentation is everything\"
it is the unfriendly staff however that will keep me away"}
{"text":"Don't let the name of this place fool you. They're not only good in making crepes, their waffles and pretty tasty too! I had Chocolate Karma and the waffle was soft, fluffy, and crunchy on the outside. Not many places managed to execute all three components well but this cafe did it! Woohoo! I wished they would add some fruits and handmade whipped cream but that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"The Yelp page says that upon check-in, they'll give you 15% off but they don't! We came there today's morning and when I told the guy at the cash( who was polite and friendly) about the deal, he said they used to but not anymore!! and he explained that he cannot do the calculations himself because the machine does not show the discount in the receipt, and it would be a huge complication. Even though I didn't complain and understand his point, I am not convinced that why they had advertise for something they do not offer!! 
This first impression really shadowed my whole experience eating there, and I didn't much enjoy my food. My sweet crepe tasted too sweet, oily, and not-well-cooked at some parts. 
The two stars are just for its cozy atmosphere and its polite staff."}
{"text":"UPDATE: The City of Toronto apparently shares my issues with their cleanliness.  They just (April 10) received a Yellow Card from DineSafe for 6 infractions....

I have a pretty mixed take on this place...some good, some bad, some inbetween.

The COFFEE:  Underwhelming.  I've bought beans for take-out here, and despite the presence of a coffee roaster right next to the counter, they never seem to be freshly roasted.  I wonder if it's only for decoration?

A recent gripe.  The coffee condiment station was absolutely disgusting on my last visit (see the photo I posted). The white and brown sugar bowls were 95% empty and what was left was crusty and gross.  The towel they'd left on the station was disgustingly dirty.  And who knows how long the milk and cream had been left out without any refrigeration and not in a vacuum sealed container.  Poor hygiene.

The FOOD:  The crepes can be pretty good.  They're reasonably priced and pretty tasty.  Nice mix of savory and sweet.  Not exactly haute cuisine, but it works.  The honey balls are pretty sickeningly sweet...unless you have a crazy sweet tooth, I suggest avoiding it.

The STAFF:  The staff seem to live on another planet.  They rarely seem happy to serve you and often the most simple requests flummox them.  On my last visit, the woman behind the register had such poor English that we had to resort to writing messages on a paper pad.

OVERALL, I would have given this place 3.5 stars when I first started going there, but it's on a downward trajectory.  It used to be a nice alternative to all the chain coffee places nearby.  Given the hygiene issues and the poor coffee, I may start finding other nearby places to patronize."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! A very cute cafe - perfect for everything!   Saturday morning brunch, coffee dates, and even studying/work sessions. The decor was very on-point, perfectly matching the expesed brick walls!My friend and I discovered this place on a good Friday, since they're one of the only brunch place opened! Yay for our hungry tummies!

I had the salmon eggs benedict crepe which was incredibly delicious, with lots and lots of hollandaise sauce. Can't go wrong with lots and lots of hollandaise sauce right? 

My friend had the vegetable crepe, but didn't like it. The vegetables were pretty raw and it ended up being really dry. 

I also had the cappuccino which I thought was pretty light as there was a lot of milk, but it was still decent! 

Will definitely be coming back to try out other stuff, sans the vegetable crepe! 

Ps: here everything is DIY - the ordering, picking up the food and clearing our your tables after. Just an FYI before you give the full tip when you order!"}
{"text":"Great selection of crepes, pastries and hot drinks. Decent prices and yummy food. Really enjoyed the coffee. Evening parking available across the street in front of lcbo. Will be back"}
{"text":"Staff is not so nice, and the crepe paste is tasteless and thick. The portions are very big and filling. I couldn't finish my crepe."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times it's a very nice snack spot. I haven't tried many of the Crepe varieties because a) I somewhat prefer the Hungarian style ones which are just slightly thicker & chewier, and b) Crepes are an exceptionally poor bang-or -the-buck compared to making at home - I mean when I smell Crepes frying I want like 3 or 4 at least and that can set you back a few $$! 

However I've had the Eggs Benny and it's a nice if pricey snack, and the Chocolate Hazelnut & Dulce LeLeche is are nice treats. They do a good job. Service is good and place is clean, only complaint is the counter with the milk,cream & sugar is kind of tight & cramped. 

I most often come to get the flaky Spinach & Cheese pies. These are really fabulous!  (made from scratch - not the marked-up frozen Krinos spirals you get most other places...) They also have an assortment of fine Greek desserts & baked goods, again all extremely fresh and authentic  (the lokoumades have no hint of oiliness and are firm without being hard ) , though this part of the counter is not as extensive as it used to be a few years ago when it was run by the Vietnamese ladies."}
{"text":"Until I had a crepe at this place I honestly didn't think I liked the dessert. I'd always thought they were like a moderately worse pancake and I never got what all the fuss was about. Then I came here.

I actually ordered the apple pie due to my skepticism while my companion ordered the crepe. But then I tried a bite of the crepe she'd ordered and holy cow. The texture was not at all what I'd experienced at other crepe places. It was more substantial and had a slight crisp to it (somewhat similar to a South Asian dosa). It didn't have any of the limp chewiness I'd experienced with other crepes. It was sweet, the fruit filling was good, and the condensed milk on top is a stroke of genius. The apple pie was decent too but next time I'm definitely going back for my own crepe, probably a very simple filling, and of course, lots of that condensed milk goodness!

If you're like me and have never really enjoyed crepes, just give this place a try. You may be very pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I had a 10 dollar meal with the 15% off coupon! The Monster Crepe that just had a good amount of everything and a side of salad. The salad was quite fresh and drizzled generously with a thick balsamic reduction. Not much variety in the salad, just cucumbers and lettuce, that's fine.

The star of the dish was obviously the monster crepe, it was a 4 layered crepe folded into a not so pleasing shape ( imagine a quarter of a circle ) it also looked more like a roti with its small browned circular patterns speckled across the surface. However, the first cut into the crepe released magic. It was packed to the brim with a wide variety of ingredients, there was ham, egg mushrooms, broccoli, it was like thanksgiving come early for me, that is how stuffed that crepe was. 

It was also incredibly satisfying, the large crepe filled me up and actually had me craving dessert. I had the tiramisu and it's quite a good tiramisu, though the size is probably the best part, share with a friend or else you'll find yourself carrying a good sized food baby on your way out of the cafe-esque interior. 

Lovely waitresses and nice decor. will probably be back to try the sweet crepes!"}
{"text":"Overall,  great crepes and atmosphere. it's a nice snack/desert spot. I ordered Thai crepe and it was so good.  Little bit pricey but it was worth it."}
{"text":"We ordered the Hot Chick, the Eggs  Benedict, Chiquita Mix Fruits, Apple Turnover  and a mochaccino.

The portions were pretty big, especially the savory ones, and the crepe itself was crispier was well. The sweet crepe was thinner, solid amount of ice cream and fresh fruits. 

The large mug of mocha was great value for its price, and not that sweet.

Interior wise, the storefront was roomy, bright and inviting. great service overall!"}
{"text":"Just \"okay\" in my opinion. I ordered the eggs Benedict crepe which tasted alright but the crepe was a bit over cooked and too crispy. The Hollandaise sauce was a bit too watery and not thick enough. Overall, I've had better and I probably will not be returning to this place again."}
{"text":"Delicious.  The crepes are great, although I must admit I can't think of a time that I've ever had a really awful crepe.  The interior of the restaurant is fairly small and basic.

The prices are very reasonable - sweet crepes start at $3.25 and go up to $6.  Savory crepes are about $5 - $7.

I highly recommend the chocolate and walnut crepe - great combination.  They also make a fantastic mango smoothie for only $3.50."}
{"text":"The sweet crepes are very well priced ($4.00).  The savoury ones aren't that much more pricey ($6.00.)

That's really where the good stuff ends though.  My experience here equates to half of two different flavours.  I've been just the one time.  And it will be my last time for a while.  

The crepes, themselves, were a little burned.  This was not a good start.  One of the crepes was Eggs Benny.  Unfortunately the sauce was sour (I'm not sure if that's because it was prepared poorly, or if this is just the quality that can be expected.)

The worst thing?  That sour sauce was the only flavour to be had in the ham and egg collective. 

The other crepe was the Hot Chick.  It was better.  There was some flavour in the form of the hot sauce, but rather than a, \"hot chick,\" it was more a, \"mild,\" or, \"tepid,\" chick.  The chicken was textured well... but, end of the day - compared to the other crepes in the city - I see no reason for this place to stand out.

I liked the brick walls.  Service was great.

That's enough to get me back in, down the road, to try it out again.

Maybe it was just an off day?"}
{"text":"This place is easy to miss as it does not have an obvious sign.   I was attracted by the 15% coupon but it turned out it was not valid if you are not a student.  The menu was extensive and I ordered a crepe with fruits / strawberries as my desert.   

I ordered a strawberry with chocolate sauce.   It was good and blew my calorie budget for the day.   It was totally worth it sacrificing my diet."}
{"text":"Just got done enjoying the Montreal Crêpe, and it was amazing! Very chill vibe. Definitely a place I'll be coming back to!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for crepes and thats all I've gotten. Sort of disappointed in myself for never having tried their coffees. 

I've had the crepe which is egg ham and cheese and it is absolutely delicious. This is one of the better crepe places I've been to. The savoury crepes are cheap! So filling and made so well all the ingredients taste fresh. I've also has the hazelnut crepe which was cheap as well around $4. I believe both crepes together came to just over $13.  The crepes are huge so I dont really suggest getting both unless you plan to share one. When i got both they made me my savoury one first let me eat it then made my hazelnut one. They're great at not rushing you out they want you to enjoy your meal and they want you to enjoy the crepes as they are fresh.

Its easy to miss this place if you are just walking by but I recommend searching for it as its defiantly a great little gem in the core of the city with cheap and delicious crepes."}
{"text":"This place is friendly, affordable, and offers a decent range of ingredients, especially for the sweet menu.  I came here yesterday for lunch and tried three crepes from the menu. I shared two sweet crepes and one savory crepe, but next time I think I'd skip on the savory menu because most of these rely on egg fillings, and the range of ingredients doesn't seem to work as well as the sweet options.

That being said, I'd nearly always choose sweet over savory anywhere, so I feel like the savory menu choices need to taste twice as good to compete with crepes like \"The Dark Angel\", a delicious mess of dark chocolate and hazelnut crepe wrapped around a large scoop of ice cream.  The \"Mexican\" sounded good but needed more Dulce de leche - I didn't really taste it enough.

Like I mentioned, most of the savory options include egg, and the custom-made options fell short when I tried to avoid this ingredient. The bathroom could use a good scrubbing but the staff singing Christmas carols was a nice touch. I'd recommend this place for dessert!"}
{"text":"YUM!

This place is great!  Cheap, freshly made and yummy!!  LOVE IT.

The staff is very sweet and they help you decide as they have a large menu and can make anything you want really.  

The crepes travel well and stay warm for a long time.  Surprisingly they are also very filling.  Much more so then Cafe Crepe

I have been meaning to go back and try a sweet crepe, but I just haven't made it.  I will be doing that this week and will update you all on the success of the visit.

One word of caution - DO NOT USE THE BATHROOM.  It's ok, but it's very tiny, unkept and really should be for staff only.  I would not have used it if I didn't NEED to pee.

Stop in if you're in the village."}
{"text":"Overly expensive, my eggs were prepared improperly and I was given a type of bread that I didn't order.  When confronted about it and asked to fix, my server didn't really take it as something serious and started laughing.  I'm appalled at the service and lack of professionalism.  Wouldn't recommend this establishment to any of my friends.  Oh, and if I weren't to remind them that I ordered a carrot cake side, they wouldn't have brought it out at all."}
{"text":"**4.5 stars**

Due to my crepe craving, we had to try this place, which was a few blocks from our hotel. My boyfriend and I ordered the seafood crepe and the eggs benedict crepe (which were about $6/each). Although they took a while to make, they were worth it. The seafood crepe was crispy and had tons of filling such as crab. My only gripe is that the hollandaise sauce on the eggs benedict crepe was not consistent (there was obvious separation). Other than that, it was filled with deliciousness as well.

I also got the Vietnamese iced coffee. Although the taste was right, they should serve it in a smaller cup because it only filled half of their glass which looks weird.

The service was very friendly. They could tell we were tourists (lol!) and gave us some suggestions on where to go!

Overall, this is a very quaint and relaxed shop and well worth the price for some delicious crepes."}
{"text":"I've never had a crepe before, so we decided to check this place out.  After one bite, it became our spot for a tasty, cheap place to eat.  I tried the peanut butter chocolate chip and it was instantly my fav.  We also tried the Dulce de Leche (meh), mozz cheese and strawberry (I thought it was gross, my friend loved it) and the one with sweetened condensed milk (it was ok).  I'd say the pb and chocolate one was the best.  The inside is small and a little run down, but the tasty crepes make up for it.  We went here probably 5 times during our 3 day stay.  If we ever go back to Toronto, we'd for sure eat here again."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I didn't even try the crepe here.  

So why the 2 stars??

I ordered 3 crepes to be delivered from grubcanada...1.5 hours after I was curious as to why it was taking so long so I called grubcanada to check what was going on, I thought that they did not process the order, however they got a confirmation from the restaurant and Crepe it Up choose not to recognize my order and did not create it but didn't tell grubcanada or call me about the neglected order.  They simply told the delivery company they weren't going to complete the order 1.5 hours after the order was placed. 

I gave them 2 stars instead of one because the food does look good.  So all in all do not order delivery."}
{"text":"3.5 really. While we both enjoyed our crepes, they were perhaps a bit too thick- more like a thin pancake.  Considering the four star rating, I was expecting to be blown away.  I am told that the fruit crepe was excellent."}
{"text":"I ordered the BLT & Bagel and my girlfriend ordered the Monster Savory Crepe. My BLT bagel was great while my girlfriends crepe was way better. You can really taste the everything bagel that they served the BLT in and the crepe itself and the spinach inside it. Solid restaurant, will be coming back in the future!
PS: the restaurant was renamed to Pavillion TB!"}
{"text":"We went out of our way to eat here on Friday for brunch. Ordered a chai and  a crepe. Mine was packed with veggies and feta cheese. The light dusting of seasoning made the crepe more savory than sweet which I liked a lot. This place is small and was packed when we were there. We sat by the windows and took in the people watching while we waited. The only reason for lack of star was the bathroom was a bit of a mess."}
{"text":"This was an awful dining experience. I happened to look at the clock when we came in, which is good because when my wife asked if this was a ridiculously long wait it just seemed that way because she was hungry I could actually answer. 

It took 10 minutes for my coffee to come out. Ten minutes later their smoothie arrived. It took another 20 for our food to be served - and it was wrong.  My wife has a wheat allergy and asked if she could order the insides of the monster crepe. They said no problem. About 15 minutes after we ordered the cook double checked that eggs were ok; my wife said yes she did want the eggs and the cook asked how she'd like them. So it was a bit surprising when the plate came out with no eggs!?! 

...but not that surprising since a friend of the cook came in right after she'd asked about the eggs and they spoke across the counter while she was prepping the food. He, of course, was in and out - arrived about 10 minutes after we did and took his food to go about 10 minutes later. We sat hungry waiting 40 minutes for 2 average crepes and one inaccurate mess.

My crepe was solid, not great, but in isolation my food would have been ok. The rest of the experience was terrible."}
{"text":"I am a fan! 

Not only that this coffee shop is local, they also have one of the best Cafe Americano. Top that with Tres Amigo crepe - a combination of strawberry, mozzarella cheese and hot fudge. And Dark Angel - an explosion of chocolate. The result? AMAZING. 

Don't be guilty for eating such a sweetilcious dessert - coffee is known to be good for your heart so it kinda evens out. Right? Right? 

The place is small with about 10 stools and four tables that can seat four people each. There is no wifi which means that there is no chair-hogging mac-carrier patrons (ouch, that's me). 

I'm giving four stars because it can be very hot in the summer as there is no air conditioner. But it's got the FABULOUS view of Church Street where you'll see tons of characters in a good way. From drag queens to muscle boys to really hot women. People watching here is a bonus as there are two HUGE windows. 

On a good cool weather, however, this place is perfect. Can we make our Yelp rating seasonal? 

Servers? Superb and willing to make recommendations. They serve you with a genuine smile. 

I'll come back. This is a great alternative to Starbucks. Maybe we should go together? Raise your hand!"}
{"text":"Got the paris crepe here and it was overall average.  Very sweet (as expected) and a large portion size for the price.  The banana had some dark spots (could have been fresher), but tasted OK. 

The general look and feel of the place that made it get 3 stars: the place in general looks kind of dirty, not a good feel for a restaurant. Service was quick but the self serve type (you go up and order, and then pick up your food when it's ready).  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Whether you're just thinking of a dessert crepe or savoury ... They've covered all grounds. There's also baked goods. But tonight, with the mellow mood, I treated to a nice cuppa tea and coconut cake. It was almost like a butter pound slice of cake, but with a coconut grit taste to it. Delightfully, not to overpowering. The crepe was nice and apples that was used were also fresh. Spotted baked goods such as pies and spanakopita. Worth definitely going back. The owner serving us was also a nice considerate chap. A chill casual place in the heart of church - Wellesley area to grab a snack or more"}
{"text":"Excellent crepes, friendly and accommodating, cozy.

I got the Benedict crepe with smoked salmon instead of bacon or ham (tried to give my arteries a break from the masses of Canadian bacon I had been consuming).  Although the salmon seemed like regular, baked salmon... it was still a great crepe - and innovative!  They have fun selections!  My cousin got a custom made one with peanut butter and nutella.  I won't need to tell you how incredibly yummy that was!  The crepe part was very good, but I've had better.  It's not as crispy on the ends as I prefer.  I like the crispy-chewy types.  These were a tiny bit too soft/mushy in some spots, although I have no complaints.  

I really enjoyed the shop itself!  Very cute, cozy, great seating options... especially by the window.  I think it's in the gay neighborhood of Toronto, if that's something you take into consideration.  

Prices are seriously cheap!  High quality, unique, pleasant people, and this cheap?  I'd be a regular here if I lived in in Toronto.  

Definitely check it out if you're here!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me! Cheap and cheerful and the coffees aren't too bad either. This morning I had the Montreal crepe and the cinnamon and banana crepe.. I couldn't decide between savoury or sweet so I chose both!"}
{"text":"These guys have just re-opened after a complete rennovation. They took over the bay next door so now they are double the size. The new interior is much warmer and more inviting. So many good changes, you should just come check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Large portion sizes for decent price!
Small cozy place
Didnt like the monster crepe as much 
But loved the benedict one's sauce. Amazing!
Love this place"}
{"text":"Consistently good food, area bar, and cheap. Great bfast options. 
Solid standby for me 
And they roast ground their own coffee on premise , and somehow managed to roast up one of the better beans in the city despite not being baristas."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto and stopped by this place because of the great Yelp reviews. It did not disappoint. I got the Dark Angel which was delicious. The ice cream inside it melts fairly quickly, but I expected that from a hot crepe. The prices were very reasonable and the crepes are quite filling. The staff was friendly and professional. And it is easy to find within the downtown area of Toronto."}
{"text":"Came in here with a friend for an afternoon dessert snack. The two ladies at the counter weren't what you'd call the brightest and attentive (one of them forgot that she owed me change). The service was very slow even though there were only three other people in the cafe besides us. 

We got the Paris X crepe and a custom Strawberry+Chocolate+Condensed Milk crepe. The prices are fantastic for what you get, but the crepes themselves turned out to be way too sweet for our tastes. I guess that just comes with the territory, unless they committed to a less sweet sugar like dextrose.

The cafe is great for studying and sitting on your computer, though!"}
{"text":"This place was great on both of the two occasions I have ventured. The first time I ordered the Hawaiian crepe and added an egg and it was fresh and delicious. The second time I ordered the Monster and it was fantastic and make me feel like I was eating healthy. 

They have these dessert dough balls made with honey that you HAVE TO TRY! They kind of goo in your mouth and taste super fresh and they are cheap. 

I have not tried the desserts but they have a great selection and some of their stuff is super cute. The restaurant looks like a converted market and has a cool vibe though I will note that I have found it quite hot in there."}
{"text":"i love crepe what can i say. this is quick, cheap, easy, and tastey! so happy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. The food tastes great without being overwhelming. The environment is very casual and cozy. My girlfriend and I ordered the egg Benedict crepe with salmon. If you like your crepe wet make sure you ask for a bit extra sauce. The fruit smoothie was great and the frappe cappuccino was delish. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is a very regular stop for me on weekend mornings. I do really like the convenience and selection in this cafe but have yet to try any of the crepes or waffles. So far stuck to coffees and taking cake, pie or a pastry home. 
So far all nice and looking forward to trying a sweet crepe there soon. Everything is slightly priced too high for what your getting, the bill does take me back sometimes.
Also I think service could be sped up slightly, I understand a relaxed atmosphere but on occasion when a line has formed there just seems to be no pick up in pace."}
{"text":"Recently tried this place as it has good reviews. The prices of the crepes were very reasonable however the taste was just ok. 

I ordered the Mexico crepe which had apple slices  inside and a caramel sauce on top. The crepe itself had a raw dough taste and was slightly mushy in texture. The apples were also extremely mushy and did not have much of a taste to it except being sweet. The caramel sauce tasted not too bad and it was also very sweet. Maybe they should of used a different type of apple that was more tart and more crisp to balance out flavor and the texture. 

The place itself is pretty cute with few seatings and big windows. However I rather pay a higher price for better quality crepes. Maybe I just had a bad experience with mine but this place will definitely not be my first choice for crepes."}
