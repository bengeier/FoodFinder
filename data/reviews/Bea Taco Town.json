{"text":"Ordered a chimichanga, got a soggy burrito, bland rice and bland beans, and not even a grand opening portion or flavor!  Look what kind of meal one gets for $20 and this was seriously sad and disgusting.  WORST MEXICAN FOOD, EVER!!!"}
{"text":"As a kind-of taco snob, this place passes muster (for what one can expect of tacos in Western Pennsylvania, anyway). Chopped and sprinkled cilantro is a good sign. Diced onions are a good sign. Well-marinated tacos al pastor is a good sign. Jarritos is a sign. Expect a line, but it moves quickly and there always seems to be available seating. A testament to how you'll want to quickly savor some of the better tacos in downtown."}
{"text":"A few months ago I was driving to the south hills from town and got detoured through the Fort Pitt tunnels which led me to Banksville Road.  Well, this was very fortuitous since it was just before 6 p.m. and I was hungry for dinner.  I instinctively set my course to Beechview where I could drop into El Milagro but, once I hit Wentzel, I was again detoured due to a traffic accident.  Since I couldn't turn up the hill I decided to try a place that had been recommended to me by a legal immigrant from Sinoloa working as a mason (and a really good worker).  That place?  Bea Taco Town.  Now, I realize that there are multiple locations and I do not know much about the company but I can now do a legitimate review.   In fact, I've been back to the Banksville Bea three times after my initial visit.  Yup, it is really, really, really that good.  Does it have a lot of Texas in their food?  Yes there is some Texas ... not nearly as much as most other places and this place doesn't serve inferior food like many others do .  Make no doubt about it, the classic Mexican flavors and quality are there in some delicious upscale authentic creations.   So, on my first visit I walk into a modest building with typical Mexican decorations and colors setting the scene for what to expect.  I was seated and told Jarritos were in a cooler near the door.  I am not a soda drinker but its always nice to see Jarritos (again, setting the stage).  I take a good look at the menu.  Excellent selection of food, competitive prices, clever combinations of \"specialty or upscale tacos\" along with the common taco stand build your own though they build it for you.  I give them a lot of credit for admitting there are true Mexican style tacos with radish, cilantro and onion (white onion!) as well as the Americanized lettuce and cheese version.  Also, even though Bea uses some creative names on their menu they have things set up in a way that it isn't \"hokie\" or \"silly\" with some giant picture of an iguana wearing a sombrero and bolero.  My first and second visits were tacos.  First time around was the basic carnitas tacos on double corn soft shells with radish, tomatillo sauce, cilantro, and white onion. They were OUTSTANDING.  Everything about their tacos was excellent.  I have to stress that I LOVE tacos and these are among the VERY BEST if not the best tacos in town.  As far as tacos go, I think these ones duke it out with La Palapa.  I cannot remember the name of the second batch of tacos during my next visit but any time a restaurant serves cactus as part of a meal it instantly makes me think \"south of the border.\"  The third time I visited I strayed from the norm and ordered their version of enchiladas verde.  In case you haven't figured it out, I judge restaurants by many different things but enchiladas con verde sauce, tomatillo sauce, carnitas, types of tortillas, tamiquena, guacamole and salsa de mesa are staples that cannot be screwed up, period (I am not a soup guy unless it is cold outside and don't even really care for Menudo). Well, the enchiladas were definitely on the smallish side but the preparation and taste were authentic, legitimately sublime tasting perfection.  Great things definitely can come in small packages.  However, in this instance, the black beans were NOT good at all.  They tasted almost like they came from a can and the rice was also dry.  I was served VERY small side dishes too.  If this were my first experience I'd be questioning the place but, being this is my third visit and my first two were AWESOME, I am chalking this up to Bea not having the best night (the place was NOT busy for a Thursday at dinner time) though they certainly need to be better on this night.  To end, I had AMAZING tacos ... fighting for the best in town and they have delicious enchiladas (served with plenty of verde sauce thank goodness!) and good tasting sides two of the three times.  For my money, if they served a bit larger portions and tighten up quality control on their sides Banksville Bea would fall between 4 1/2 and 5 stars.  I highly recommend this place to anyone though it should be noted this isn't a restaurant with ambiance and superior decor ... it is highly recommended for the food.  I'd go back there in a second ... in fact, sooner than one may think."}
{"text":"I noticed Bea Taco Town as I was walking to the library, so I decided to stop by on a day that I didn't bring my lunch.  They had a great selection of tacos / burritos / quesadillas, as well as chips & salsa. I ordered two vegetarian tacos and chips and salsa - very good and filling! The tacos tasted very authentic (reminded me of the time I had street tacos in Mexico), and the salsa was fresh and spicy. The staff was also very friendly, and the food came out in a timely manner.   I will definitely be back the next time I don't bring a lunch!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today...delicious! We waited a bit for our food but everything's made from scratch so it was completely worth it. I'd highly recommend the cochinita pibil tacos with pico de gallo and guacamole. We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I waited 25 minutes and paid $10 for two of the worst tacos I've been had.  The food was cold and the drinks were similarly over priced.  Tacos are hard to screw up, but they manage it.  Anyone who likes this place must also rate taco Bell highly."}
{"text":"This was one of the more unpleasant dining experiences I've had. Coworker's and I received very poor service and the server was inconsistent and frazzled. We found out it was BYOB, which, was bizarre for a mexican restaurant not to serve margaritas. When it was time to pay our bills, myself and a coworker got shorted 6-7 dollars each in change. We were so fed up with the service that we didn't bother to remedy the situation. Decent food, but not worth the experience."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the barbacoa tacos here (add rice, beans and pico!). I crave them every day and don't want to admit how many times a week I end up getting them... get there early in the week, as the barbacoa is usually gone by Friday!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. I tried the OMG tacos. OMG, they had no taste! The meat was tough and unseasoned, and why were there two shells for each taco? Maybe because they were mushy and fell apart easily. Yet I will give them another chance with a different menu item. Perhaps they were having an off day."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.  It was excellent.  The owner/manager was very friendly, the food was delicious.  My kids loved it, which is incredible since they typically don't care for Mexican food.  We will definitely be eating there again."}
{"text":"We were dispointed. The ground beef tacos were served without any sauce.  The server did ask if we canted mold or hot sauce but did not return woth any. The quesadilla did not have onions or peppers, the chicken was very dry, the chicken and cheese were center in the middle leaving the edges just shell and it's small size was disappointing. You get the idea. Our server was very nice but seemed to have too many duties....taking phone orders, preparing takeout orders, helping other staff.  We plan to give them a second chance before we give up."}
{"text":"First time here. I came with a guy who loves Mexican and he loves it here. Truly authentic cuisine.   You've got to look past the old decor and trust that it's good.   I had three tacos all different flavors. Tortillas were not homemade and could have used some frying to get the crispy!   The hot sauce was smoking hot.   Staff was super friendly and amazingly fast service for a quick lunch meal."}
{"text":"Good place for authentic south of the border tacos, reminded me Mexico City tastes.  Nice family feel, great taste, eat-in place nice enough, no luxury but clean overall.  Good experience !"}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican food. Will definitely be back to try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Quick and very good!  Missed the lunch crowd and had the pork OMG Tacos. You can't go wrong with it, but you have to add the hot sauce."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The food speaks for itself. The ingredients were fresh and made to order. I ordered two tacos, one with chorizo and one with carne asada. The chorizo one was so good, I could probably eat them everyday, for 3 meals a day, all week long!!! My BF got the burrito with chorizo. Amazing.   One thing to note. The hot sauce. Holy moly, it is HOT. Mind you, I love hot sauce. I put Frank's and Cholula hot sauce on many food items all the time. But this hot sauce is not to be messed around with. Do not dump the entire cup on your meal without testing it haha. My BF and I were literally sweating and drowning ourselves with water. But I would gladly do it all over again :)"}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  The service was beyond bad..we waited 10 minutes before anyone even came to take our drink order, then waited 10 more while the guy ran around delivering misc items to all of the tables around us.  We ordered water...how hard is that? The chips were flavorless which was a perfect match for the tasteless queso.  Our food came out 25 minutes later and to say it was luke warm is generous.  My husband had to ask them to heat his burrito up and our waiter never even acknowledged his issue.  No apology or anything. When he finally got to eat there were about 5 small pieces of meat scattered in with the tons of rice and beans.  We will never come back here.  This place is a complete waste of time."}
{"text":"the chicken dorado's are amazing. they give you a perfect portion for a great price. if you work in the city, you need to stop here for lunch. I wouldn't dine in because there is a lot of traffic, but the food is excellent and the people that work here are always so friendly."}
{"text":"Great food, quick service, great prices! Highly recommended. I had the Chicken Dorotos w/refried beans. Their hot sauce is awesome too !"}
{"text":"They're new and clearly still working out a few of the kinks. That said, I thought the tacos were excellent. We went to dine in shortly after they first opened and it was somewhat disorganized - they were out of some things, some things were forgotten and the staff seemed a bit harried, but I liked the tacos enough to give it another try for takeout. The second time around was a better experience. We ordered a \"sampler\" of many of their various taco options. I liked them all. One reviewer on here commented that the shrimp tacos weren't great - I didn't try those, because as a rule, I don't expect much out of seafood from this far inland - stick to the terrestrial options and you'll be in good shape. I thought the al pastor (pork w pineapple) and chicken tinga tacos were the best. Fresh cilantro, onion and they are REAL about their spice if you ask for spicy salsa. I like them as much as Las Palmas. Bea's will be a nice option to add to the taco rotation."}
{"text":"Awesome glorified taco stand in downtown. California burrito took me home. The tacos had generous portions and were well seasoned. Very reasonably priced. Only knock is the decor and lack of AC."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I tried this place on Friday. It was amazing. The food was good and the prices were decent. They are also fast at making the food. Definitely found a new weekly taco place."}
{"text":"The food and service is excellent. The place itself could use some love. They seem to do an awesome business for lunch. The food seems to be \"authentic\" and is well prepared and presented. I almost always get a ranchero burrito with chorizo. The chips are a bit stale, but I love the salsa."}
{"text":"I rarely Yelp (as you can tell by my two reviews to date), but I just had to say something about Bea Taco Town.  I started working downtown seven months ago, and found Bea about two months ago. Since then, I've developed a moderate-to-severe addiction to their Ranchero Burrito. Sweet baby Jeebus, is this thing ever fantastic. Packed with chicken and other great stuff, with a killer hot sauce over the top (with an extra container, too). If I could marry a burrito, I'd marry this burrito.  If you're downtown, and even consider going to Chipotle, Moe's, or Qdoba, you really need to ask yourself why. Get your head straight and get thee to Bea."}
{"text":"Oh this place is SUPER! Authentic Mexican food is so awesome at reasonable prices, It is very clean and it seems the owner has been working hard at decorating so it is warm, festive and inviting. Good food fun looking place. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Order arrived with half of what we paid for missing.  Upon trying to contact the restaurant, they wouldn't answer as it was close to close.  Someone actually took the phone off the hook...I could hear the music.  My husband drove down and was given the remainder of the food.  The food was less than stellar for the price and was lukewarm.  The burnt bottom of the pot was in my queso dip...yum.  There are several better places in the area and i highly recommend going to them."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! Guac and chips are great. I ordered a shrimp taco salad. The ingredients were super fresh and the shrimp was cooked perfectly! My fiancé ordered the Mahi Mahi Baja tacos which he loved. The rice was a bit bland. You can tell the place is still working out its kinks, staff seemed a little hectic but the food is definitely worth the wait! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, the price is reasonable and the staff is friendly.  I would definitely recommend this place if you need a Mexican food fix."}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall Mexican dive. The food is pretty good and the prices are fair. I ordered the steak tacos w guacamole and a tostada. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is really good.  The barbacoa tacos are terrific as are the chimi's.  Service is fast and prices are reasonable for downtown.  Excellent lunch spot"}
{"text":"Came on a random afternoon and the restaurant was predictably pretty empty.  Walking in as a new customer, we were greeted warmly, but it was also awkward and unclear figuring out the seating. The decor in the dining room is older than I expected given how new he restaurant is. Our host seated us, took our drink orders and promptly forgot to bring my drink. I was not optimistic. But then the food came. I got a chimichanga and my wife got the Mahi Mahi tacos. Both were excellent. The flavors were authentic, well seasoned, displayed excellently, and delicious! After the meal, the server gave me the kitchen ticket instead of the check, then gave me the wrong check after I pointed out the error. So to sum up, it seems like (at least in the middle of the day) the service is laughably poor, but I would definitely go back for the food."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times since they opened and I am a fan. The tacos are really good and on par with area favorite las palmas, in fact in my opinion I think some of their tacos might be a little better. Just wish they had a salsa bar like las palmas.   I have also tried the ranchero burrito that is topped with a red sauce that is really good. My favorite however has been the dorados; 3 deep fried taquitos. The only thing I haven't been impressed with so far is the queso."}
{"text":"This is the most perfect divey and authentic taco establishment. Food is amazing, service is fast for the lunch crowd, and prices are cheap. Fish tacos are perfection and nothing is ruined with mayo or sour cream like typical Americanized Mexican food."}
{"text":"Talk about picture perfect tacos and burritos. This hole-in-the-wall tacqueria is worth a trek downtown."}
{"text":"I ordered from them via Grubhub and was pretty disappointed.  We ordered a taco salad and asked for the guacamole and pico de gallo on the side instead they just skipped it completely.  I ordered a chorizo taco which came with maybe a teaspoon of meat.  I should of taken a picture because I was really surprised at how small the portion was.  What there was of the chorizo was good but the chicken in the taco salad was bland.  Tasty queso though.  All this and delivery took over an hour.  Might be willing to try it again but overall I was definitely less than impressed."}
{"text":"The food is super authentic and absolutely delicious. The atmosphere is okay, but they have a step in the center of the room where I've almost wiped out a few times.   Definitely try the tacos. I am also obsessed with their queso."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, and cilantro heaven.    I ordered because I had seen really good reviews.  The prices looked really reasonable, and the menu was simple.   I think the freshest and best foods come from the simpler menus, and the rule applies here as well.  I will be challenged on the next order to decide between getting the same awesome choices or trying some of the other menu items.   The pineapple pork tacos with cilantro.   OMG.  But honestly all three tacos were extremely satisfying.    And the queso was a two thumbs up review as well.  The burrito got a few excited looks from my husband as he shoveled it in, and we were picking up morsels of food that fell out of the tacos with our hands.  Not a single crumb was left behind."}
{"text":"Really friendly cashier and chef in the back. Food is reasonably priced for its quality. I had taquitos and rice with a Jarito(Mango soda) and I was very satisfied."}
{"text":"authentic Mexican dishes.  delicious, priced right and the lady that takes your order is always smiling and friendly.  you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Wow! Just got my first takeout and am pleasantly surprised at how good the meal was! EVERYTHING was really really good. I could tell that the food was made with attention to detail. I had a quesadilla with pulled pork a side of guacamole and pico de Gallo. chips and salsa, black beans and tres leaches cake. Everything arrived hot and fresh. The salsa is fresh, and there were two sides, what they call a garlic ranch but is really made fresh with Mexican crema, and another creamy super hot condiment. The beans were excellent with a sprinkle of cotija cheese. I grew up in the southwest and love Pittsburgh but have long lamented the absence of tasty Mexican food...I think I found the missing link."}
{"text":"I ordered three of the OMG Tacos, two with beef and one with pork, for takeout.  In hindsight, I should have better reviewed the ingredients before ordering.  After the first large bite, it occurred to me there were ingredients I did not readily recognize and looked up the online menu.  There is sauteed cactus!  All three tacos were tasty and with generous portions.  I would recommend Bea Taco Town and look forward to trying something else next visit."}
{"text":"I've always walked past here and never managed to stop in. I've even heard great things about their food and somehow, it usually isn't the first idea to pop up when I'm looking for a place to eat lunch. That's probably because it's kind of tucked away in a spot on Smithfield St. that isn't close to much else.  I finally came here with a friend for lunch and I'm happy to have discovered another place for good Mexican food downtown. The place is pretty casual; you just go in and order at the counter. The menu is quite varied with tacos, burritos, tostadas, enchiladas and quite a few more options. Bea Taco Town also has a variety of meats to choose from.  I ordered the special that day which was Mahi Mahi Tacos, served Baja Style with a side of rice (or beans, but I ordered the rice). My friend ordered the Tostadas with Chicken. I can't say how her Tostadas tasted but they were beautifully presented, as were my tacos. I'm not sure exactly what the \"Baja Style\" entailed, but my tacos were topped with tomatoes, cabbage, red onions, avocado and a spicy mayonnaise of some sort. There was a nice crunch from the breading on the fish. The toppings were fresh and the mayonnaise added a creaminess and spiciness. The rice wasn't very colorful so it looked like it would be bland, but it was perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. Two tacos and a side of rice for $9.50 was the right price and the right portion for lunch.  Bea Taco Town is a great place for a quick lunch. Prices are quite reasonable and the service is quick. I would definitely like to come back to try other items from the menu."}
{"text":"I've tried one of the downtown locations before and really enjoyed it. My experience at the Banksville location wasn't quite as enjoyable, unfortunately. I felt Bea Taco Town at Banksville has lower food quality and the space was kind of gross. I'm not a hater of no frills dining but when there is a fly trap at each table, that just turns me off. There's nothing like eating your food next to a cup of floating dead flies.   Anyhow, we started with the chips and queso. The chips seemed slightly stale and the queso was alright. Our quesadilla and chimichanga both initially tasted ok but quickly got to be a bit too salty for my taste. Additionally, the way my chimichanga came out did not look anything like the way it looked in the photo on the menu. Was kind of bummed about that. Oh well.   I probably won't be stopping in here anytime soon. Let's hope the kitchen isn't also filled with fly traps!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try since the reviews were so positive. Sorry to say it was horrendous! I ordered 2 chicken Fajitacos, which were on a two 4 inch soft tacos. There was hardly any chicken on either! The meat was dry and flavorless. How to you screw up chicken?!? Service was slow. Bathroom was not clean, dining room looks dirty and still under some construction. I truly feel ripped off. So BEWARE!"}
{"text":"I actually never had their food. I had about 4 orders. The advertising said they delivered and that they were opened until 6. I called to make a delivery, the cashier said they never actually delivered and that they were closing in 5 mins. Even though its not over 6.  Whenever I have their food, I'll give a better review."}
{"text":"Fairly authentic Mexican fare. Nice variety of proteins. Service can be a little slow sometimes when they are busy. Try the OMG tacos of you are feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"Best Mexican Street Tacos in town.   I used to go to their Downtown location while I was at the Art Institute. Now that they're within a few min of my place in Greentree, it's a weekly trip for my girlfriend & I."}
{"text":"We've driven by this place several times.  I checked the reviews and was turned off by the fact that they charge for chips and salsa.  I mean, every Mexican restaurant offers complimentary chips and salsa.  I just didn't get it.  Finally, we decided to try it anyway and I am so glad that we did.  The food was excellent!!  Everyone in my family of five was very happy with their food and that rarely happens.  The prices are also beyond reasonable.  Our total came to $55 for five dinners and five beverages.  And again, that rarely happens.  We will be return customers for sure!  I guess you really do pay for those \"complimentary\" chips and salsa in other Mexican restaurants...it's built in to the menus prices.  I'd rather skip the chips and salsa for affordable, delicious food any day.  I can eat chips and salsa at home."}
{"text":"I am from Arizona so to score high with tacos they would have to be really good. The service was good, food was prompt and above average quality. This is a good spot for a quick bite to eat. It did not wow me but I would go back if I lived or worked close to here. About a 5 minute walk from the convention center."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Mexican food in the city of Pittsburgh! Have been to all three locations and I am never disappointed.  My favorite menu items are the chicken tostadas and steak tacos.  The ingredients are fresh and the color palette is vibrant. Definitely worth a visit if you love authentic Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"A friend had told me the one downtown was very good. Happy there is one in the suburbs with parking. The last few years my husband and I have been on a mission to find the best tacos in the area. Happy there are some local options now so we don't have to suffer through chains.  These tacos were huge and stuffed with meat, rice, beans, cilantro and onions. I had the chorizo and barbacoa tacos. The chorizo wasn't as greasy as chorizo can be an and it was absolutely delicious. The barbacoa was good too. They were a little dry (not the meat), but the taco overall without salsa. We got chips and guacamole so it was better with that on it. My husband also enjoyed the Tinga and al pastor tacos. They were very flavorful. My mom had the bistek taco which was good, but the meat was a little tough. She also had the Carne asada taco which was tender and delicious. My cousin had the taco salad and loved it. It had a lot of flavor and was delicious.  The only little complaint I had was that it took a long time for the food to come and the waitress wasn't the most attentive. I hate when you have to beg for more to drink. The male waiter seemed very attentive.  We loved the food and will definitely be back. This is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the area and we're picky about Mexican food."}
{"text":"Since we are overall newer to the area, we are picking different restaurants that have good reviews. The reviews are spot on here.  The restaurant is very easy to find but not a lot of parking. The restaurant is somewhat smaller. However, the food is excellent.  I had shrimp tacos and they were very good. They are medium sized tacos and I was pretty full after two and some queso with chips. My boyfriend had the OMG Tacos and he couldn't talk he was eating them so fast.  Take note their hot sauce is really really hot which we loved. They even packed some to go for us because we loved it so much.  The staff was super friendly and very helpful. The only thing I would say is the bathrooms are super small and very hard to maneuver so just use the potty before you come.   We will definitely be returning here to try other items !"}
{"text":"This particular Bea Taco Town is one of several Taco Town locations - there's another one closer to central downtown on the very same street, funny enough. But since this shop sits pretty close to the edge of downtown closer to the Monongahela River, it's a more convenient meal option for those of us working in this section of the area.  I've stopped in here a couple of times, both to dine in-house and to grab food to-go so that I could eat in my office. I don't really have a strong recommendation either way - the establishment itself is pretty minimalist: wood tables, tiled floor...There's no harm in chilling here while you enjoy your meal, and there's no big loss if you take your meal to go, either.  Way more important in my mind is what I order, because I love some good food! Here, my meals have ranged from ok to delightfully tasty. Per a coworker's rave review I once ordered a couple \"OMG tacos\". True to their name, those were some big tacos! And the toppings on them were quite tasty. The pork was sweet and juicy, always a good sign; I've had one too many dry pork tacos in my day! Unfortunately, the big strike against this particular order was that while the filling and toppings were all around yummy, my taco shells themselves were soggy. They were not soggy to the point of falling apart or anything - truth be told, if I hadn't just eaten at another taco joint the weekend before, I might not have noticed as much as I did. Alas, I did notice, and unfortunately the slightly mushy taco shells really detracted from the deliciousness that was inside them.  But another time, I ordered a naked burrito - a.k.a. a burrito bowl. This meal was much more to my liking: a bowl piled high with lettuce, rice, beans, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream and queso fresco. And all of that was topped with a meat of my choice. The lime and salt seasoning made for quite the zesty entree. Just thinking about it makes me want to come back for more...  Though I'm admittedly not a regular here, between my meals here and my coworkers' unanimous love for Taco Town, I know that their menu has some solid options for when I find myself craving some Mexican while at work; plus, given how busy a certain other spot in Market Square is, it's nice to have a less crowded go-to for my burrito and burrito bowl needs! Taco Town will see me again at some point, for sure."}
{"text":"Better than Taco Bell, but not much.  We got the chips and queso.  Chips are ok, but the queso was not cheesy.  More like white sauce with a touch of cheese in it.   Not much cheese taste to it.  We also got five types of tacos.  They were just ok.  They all came with beans and rice in them like some kind of burrito.  I did not like this at all.  It made them more bland than they should be.  When they were brought to our table, our server asked us if we wanted salsa for them. We replied we did, however it took another 5+ minutes for him to bring out 3 little containers of liquified \"salsa\" that did not taste good or add any good flavors to the tacos.  One was mild, one was green and was one \"hot.\"   Anyway, we probably won't be back. Not sure how this place made any of the \"best taco\" lists in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"First time visit and came away happy. I opted for a pair of beef tacos with what I thought would be beans and rice on the side but they ended up in the tacos. Both options though are on the chalkboard menu overhead after closer review. My order was served to me a few minutes later at one of a handful of inside tables. Quite a few folks were doing take-out due to the beautiful weather so seating was not a problem.  The ingredients in my taco were fresh and tasty. They double shell their tacos to prevent structural failures from occurring. Provided with the meal was a small container of what I assumed was a house salsa. I should have been tipped off to the contents due to the small amount provided as it was some of the hottest sauce I've experienced. I'd return again with my now better knowledge of their menu."}
{"text":"This place is just around the corner from my office and I've been here 4 or 5 times so far.   On the plus side, this is one of the few \"authentic\" Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh. I've had their food several times now and in general the food is much better than the big chains. If it were just about the food, I'd give them 5 stars. Clearly I like the place since I've been there several times.     On the down side, they are not particularly organized and my actual orders have been hit and miss.  I usually get a to-go order.  Twice I have called in the order, conveyed exactly what I want and said I'll be there in 10 minutes.  Seems like no problem.  Then when I arrive 10 minutes later, the cashier rings me up and THEN the order actually goes in, even though I said I called in the order. 15 minutes after THAT, my order comes out, right after the guy who was in line in front of me who didn't call anything in.  That's not how a call-in order is supposed to work.  If they don't take call-in orders, say so.  If you do, it should work.  That's one star off.  Furthermore, out of the 4 or 5 times I've been there, the to-go orders have been wrong twice.  This isn't that complicated.  I ordered one meal each time.  If you are dining in, that may be an easy fix, but when it is a to-go order, it means you are stuck with the wrong order.  That's another star off.      So the food is great, the dine-in service is good (order and pay in-line and then sit down with your number and they bring it to you) but the order taking and to-go service needs some work.  A place with only a few tables has to rely on to-go orders so it is important that they fix this.  PLEASE fix this."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST vegetarian tacos, chicken taquitos (dorados), chips, guacamole and Mexican rice. Ever since we discovered this place I can't stop going there!! Pretty sure I could eat here every day and be very happy about it. :)"}
{"text":"Problem: I wanted to escape a snow storm and I was hungry for a taco.  Solution: this place.   If you like authentic Mexican, this is the place. The guac was great and fresh. The tacos were delish- not too much cilantro, just how I like them.   No regrets!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Small quick taco spot with much more.  I had two tacos, beef and pork. The hot sauce that comes with the tacos is perfect. Use it.  This place is legit!"}
{"text":"Authentic flavor, well-prepared, helpful service. This is my go-to spot when I am downtown during the day & want a meal."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty - my go to place will still be las palmas but these tacos were pretty good too.  I opted for the traditional tacos - 1 carne asada (steak) and 1 carnitas (slow cooked pork). Good but didn't blow my mind."}
{"text":"I got the ranchero burrito with fish in it. I was impressed! I will definitely be coming back to test out more of the menu. The dining area could use some remodeling but the food more than makes up for the poor looking dining room. It will be nice to have an authentic Mexican place so close!"}
{"text":"Not a bad lunch spot. The fish is good! The tacos are pretty decent as are the ranchero burritos. The steak is super salty. The salsa is like water. They get your food out in 5-10 minutes."}
{"text":"One of the few real Mexican places in Pittsburgh.  Never disappoints. If you are a fan of tacos done \"real\" this is the place in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I went today for the first time.  I ordered a taco salad with chorizo. I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that it was the best taco salad I've ever had.  I'll definitely be going back.   My friend and I got there a bit before 12 and there was virtually no line and plenty of seating. However, it did soon get packed. Since it is a smaller place,  you may want to plan for carry out if you go during the lunch rush, or go a bit early to get a table."}
{"text":"The BEST tacos on this side of downtown! The food is delicious. They have an extensive menu with a wide variety of meat choices, even some exotic choices, and vegetarian options. I've gotten the Chimichanga a good 6 times now and have yet to be disappointed. I have tried the tinga de pollo (a mildly spicy chicken) that's good and the ground beef. It comes with rice or beans, or you can ask for half-portions of both (these are black beans, and you can also ask for them re-fried). The tacos are $3 a piece and come with onions, cilantro, optional beans and rice, and a very, VERY spicy sauce/salsa.  The only downfall is that it can get very, VERY busy during the 12:00 lunch hour - there are a handful of tables but sometimes not enough for the influx of people and the line can get rather long. It is absolutely worth the wait - as long as you have more than a half hour to get food. A lot of days I can be in and out, other days are a little rough."}
{"text":"Things were totally lost in translation but boy was it good. I had the shrimp & fish with rice and beans. The fish was fried and rolled in a taquito like thing. The shrimp was sautéed in a delightful sauce. The description mentioned something about peas and potatoes. I think they were supposed to be in the twice but I only saw one pea and no potato. The menu says to ask for a salad but I was told they don't have one. Anyway I could tell from the walk ins it's popular. The salsa was creamy like but very tasty. Prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"Since moving to Pittsburgh from Brooklyn a year ago, I've only come across a few restaurants that are worth saying something about, and Bea Taco Town is definitely one of those! I've been 3 times now, and was super impressed every time. Absolutely delicious. Really friendly employees too. Try the OMG tacos!"}
{"text":"I wanted a taco salad without the shell, rice and beans.  Asked for lots of the other toppings and this is what I get.  I would rather go to Qudoba!"}
{"text":"Cool place to grab burritos/tacos. I frequent the one in town and this restaurant has a bigger seating area."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot! Authentic taco and everything. Reasonable price and fast serving speed. They have couple tables to dining in and also waiting sofa for take out."}
{"text":"I wasn't excited about this place on my first visit but the second...delish!! The grilled mani tacos were amazing...the tostadas and the Americano taco was great....the retried beans were salty....my only complaint. Everything is made fresh and in front of you if you are there for take out. The staff is wonderful...had a blast talking with my adorable 12 year old waiter and his father? Uncle? Seems to be family run and everyone is nice and helpful. True authentic Mexican food. We will be back."}
{"text":"Love it. It's a lunch staple for people in my office we come here twice a week. Food is great service is quick and courteous. Everyone needs to try the OMG tacos."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. Staff is very nice! The pollo is very good and the beans are good to. Very large space, good for parties and also get good food for cheap. Overall great!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Mexican food this is the place to go. I suggest getting the chicken tacos. I have only had tacos so cant say much about the other food but its probably good too."}
{"text":"This place was ok; I like the more authentic approach to the tacos: using two corn tortillas. I didn't like how the beef and chicken was a little dry and lacked full flavor. They were generous with the cilantro which is always a plus in my book. I will say that it's nice to have an alternative to chipotle or qdoba downtown that's more authentic and not too overpriced."}
{"text":"I went here due to the outstanding reviews. When I got there I found there was a long wait so went back to my hotel room and ordered through the Yelp app. The menu looked great, as did the photos. I had a hankering for tacos and they have a pretty good selection.  My order - three tacos: one Al Pastor, one Carnitas, one Tinga de Pollo. I also ordered black beans and asked for extra salsa Roja. The expected delivery time was about 45 minutes.  The good - delivery took less than 1/2 hour. The hotel does not allow deliveries directly to the rooms so I was called to come to the lobby to pick everything up. Other good - the Tinga de Pollo was excellent. The Al Pastor was okay. The Carnitas were fairly tasteless. I was really unpleasantly surprised they use rice as a filler. When I first opened the containers (each was packed separately in a styrofoam container), they looked like the portions on meat were very generous. But, when I bit into each one, half was rice. This detracted from the taste and was disappointing. They were very generous with the amount of black beans that they served, a good thing.  Perhaps it would have been better to have waited to dine in. While the ambiance would most certainly have been better and the food hotter when it arrived, I can't imagine they would have used less rice or the Carnitas would have been better."}
{"text":"I ordered from this restaurant for the first time tonight from GrubHub. The delivery was very fast but the food was mediocre. I thought choriqueso was supposed to have chorizo in it? This was just melted cheese with a bland flavor. My boyfriend got the quesadilla with lamb. It was not worth the 15.99. Small portion and just OK. I ordered the Enchiladas potosinas with chicken. The flavor was good but the chicken was dry and overcooked, no avocado on top which I love and missed. The beans and rice were very bland as well. I think I could have made something much better at home with the 43 dollars I spent. I won't order from here again."}
{"text":"Very tasty! I got American tacos with picadollo and rice and beans. The meat was VERY tasty! The only reason I took away a star is because my tacos did not have sour cream as promised, and did have guac on them which I did not ask for, but was charged extra for. Definitely not a deal breaker, just a bit annoying. I will definitely be returning to try other menu items."}
{"text":"One of my biggest pet peeves is businesses that don't respect my time.  If you have hours until 9:00pm stay open until 9:00.  I arrived at 8:00pm an hour before the published closing time and was turned away with a lame excuse of we had a big party last night...  I don't care.  I understand you want to go home early, then change your published hours so you don't waste your potential customers valuable time.    I ended up going to Las Palmas on Brookline Boulevard about a mile away.  They were happy to see me and take my business and the carnitas tacos we're off the hook."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely wonderful, but I've been there twice (a weekend night for dinner and a weekday lunch) and the service both times has been TERRIBLE. I really want this place to succeed because the food is excellent, but the disorganized way that it's managed leaves much to be desired. The wait staff are very apologetic and nice, but the entire operation is disorganized, sloppy, and will be unsustainable if they can't get their act together.  The owners really need to hire a competent manager for the Banksville location."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I had chicken enchiladas de mole. They have Mexican coke!!! It's all authentic. Great place for lunch during the work day!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely used to be better. Looks like they're cutting corners and their quality has suffered a bit. But still a decent and cheap place to grab lunch."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco place in Pittsburgh! I went to school in town and went there three times a week. The prices are so affordable and all the staff are so nice. The vegetarian tacos have so much flavor and the homemade tortillas are the best I've ever had! My friend ordered the huge burrito and finished it all in one sitting, it was that good."}
{"text":"Had \"Bea Nachos\" today.  Added chicken - wow were they good!  Got a little soggy towards the bottom but the combination of tastes was fantastic!  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch tacos.  I had the OMG Tacos (1 beef + 1 pork).  The hot sauce was not for the faint of heart (I loved it).  The OMG came with side of black beans that had a dollop of chorizo sausage.  It was all great with many layers if flavor highly recommend and will be back to taste out the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place....took one star off because I think the meat portions could be a bit more. Freash, delicious, friendly staff and nice location. This is a great lunch spot for you to ride solo or take a friend. I ate the entire salad including the taco shell bowl. Prices are good and the service is quick as well as efficient."}
{"text":"Yes. Yes yes yes!!! Downtown Pittsburgh was lacking a bit in Mexican ever since Mexico City closed and Bea's absolutely filled that void. When BTT originally opened, I was so excited that I grabbed a menu and left it on my desk for all to see. I visited a couple times and was always pleased! I haven't been there recently, but I often drive past the Banksville location, and walk past the other downtown location further down Smithfield, so I've been wanting.   I ran in today for a naked burrito, and it really is something to behold. I asked for no cheese and extra pico and it is so delicious. The chicken is juicy and the fresh cilantro is perfect! I swear this has to be more than what they could stuff into a tortilla, and for $8 plus tax you can't beat it. Their chips and salsa are really good too, I wish I would have gotten some today!   I would suggest getting there early if you want to dine in, there is limited seating. Take out is super quick though! I gotta get my butt to the Banksville location now and make sure it's as delicious, but I'm sure it is. If only they had margs too!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Everything really fresh and tasty. Service was great too.Would definitely recommend Bea Taco Town for authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The décor isn't great but the food is fantastic.  Lengua beef tongue is delicious and one if the few restaurants around Pittsburgh to have it.  Plus it's BYOB.  Reasonable prices and support friendly."}
{"text":"Place was amazing.  The service was good but the food was amazing.   Everything tasted so fresh. By far one of the best Mexican restaurants out there.    I would highly recommend this location.  Do not disregard this restaurant because of their low prices.   In a different setting the exact same food would sell for twice as much.     I am not from Pittsburg and am basing my opinion on past experiences of Mexican food from Southern California and west coast Mexico."}
{"text":"Absolutely authentically delicious Mexican food. A must eat place. Wishing they would open a place on the East side!"}
{"text":"Bea's Taco Town is a local version of Chipotle or Qdoba.  I think the food is a step above either chain, but it's not the best Mexican food either.  First, I ordered a Chorizo burrito ($8.56 with tax).  The burrito was good, and it traveled from work to school quite well.  I found the burrito to be a bit bland, personally.  There wasn't enough mixed in to get different textures and flavors in every bite.  It was still good, hence a four star rating, but it didn't quite blow my mind.  It could have used some of the spicy green salsa from Chicken Latino in the Strip.  The food options downtown are really lacking, and this is a good and quick lunch option."}
{"text":"I'm Mexican and from California. Since moving to Pittsburgh in 2014 Bea Taco Town is no doubt some of the best Mexican food I've had here. I absolutely love carne asada everything and usually get it with their tacos or as a burrito. I wish they would sell carne asada fries and carne asada nachos! I've also tried the chicken, chicken with mole, chorizo, shrimp, and carnitas. None of those disappointed either! Their rice is also amazing! I grew up eating pinto beans, but Bea's sells black beans, and although not what I'm used to, they're pretty good here as well. I do wish the prices were a little cheaper, but that's just because I'm used to cheaper, but still delicious, Mexican food from back home. But since Bea is the best in Pittsburgh, they can definitely get away with the prices!"}
{"text":"Decent tacos. I've never had tacos with rice and beans inside rather than alongside, which made for somewhat of an imbalanced flavor. The cochinita was very tender and citrus-forward and made me yearn to make my own."}
{"text":"Pretty good but the tacos are mostly filled with rice and beans and contain very little meat. I got the Al Pastor and Barbacoa tacos. The meat is phenomenal but again, very little of It as they overly fill the tacos with rice and beans."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the authentic Mexican restaurants in the south hills.   Been here a few times.  Great tacos for the price. Try the carnitas."}
{"text":"Truly as good as it gets for Mexican food in downtown Pittsburgh.  The entrees are great but one of the lesser known gems are the nachos.  They don't appear on the menu but they are noted on the chalkboard to the left of the counter.  Wow.  Is it the healthiest option on the menu? No way.  But did you really come here for the healthiest option?  The staff is also great and very friendly."}
{"text":"So, I gave the place 5 stars.  Let's put that into perspective.  Pittsburgh has a long history of truly terrible fake Mex places at varying price points.  Here's what makes Bea's great in my opinion.  First, the good was just plain tasty.  Can't speak for authenticity, but everything I've tried (various tacos by the each) on our two trips was very good.  Second, the place is just plain cheap.  Like, our total was $21 (before tip) last trip.  This included three tacos, a burrito and a side of beans.  It's shameful to admit this, but that's the same amount we spend for junk at Taco Bell.  Obviously, I prefer to support the local guy using much better quality ingredients...  Service was polite on both trips, though not necessarily impressive.  Also, I can't seem to figure out whether the place allows BYO.  No booze sold there, but it would be nice to be able to have a beer..."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to check out for lunch downtown! $12 got me a gigantic burrito and a mexican soda. They have a great variety of meat you can choose from for either a taco, burrito, quesadilla, nachos and more. The staff was incredibly friendly and the food was delicious. The food was delicious and I will definitely be going back soon to try more of their menu items!"}
{"text":"Not a fancy place. At all. But that's not why you come here. You come for the friendly service and the food. And the food!!!! Excellent Mexican food. The usual and some specials. They have a great variety of meats  that you don't get elsewhere. I love their chicken tinga. Also plenty of vegetarian options.  Its so good I'm not sure what else to say. The food and the steady crowds speak for its self."}
{"text":"Chipotle Who? (kidding)  I stopped by Bea's today for lunch. I wanted something different and after walking by Bea's sometime last week, I've been waiting to try it out today  I ordered the \"Enchilada Suizas\" It came with 3 enchiladas (choice of chicken or beef) and was topped with lettuce, sour cream and my choice of red sauce. The dish was also served with rice and beans.   I enjoyed my lunch but i do admit it wasnt completely filling and i was hungry two hours later :\  4 stars for another authentic mexican joint downtown, wooh!"}
{"text":"Quick, cheap and delicious. I had three tacos - carne asada, cochinita pibil and pulled Chicken. It comes with this delicious hot sauce on the side. I'll definitely be going back to try the other tacos.   Update - I've been back 2 more times and am never disappointed. The tacos are quick and delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and there weren't many dining in, just a few. We were promptly seated and ordered chips and salsa, a taco salad and tacos. Food came quickly. Both were pretty good. Some was a bit bland, but I liked that nothing was smothered in sauces or cheese or anything like that. Very simple and seemingly homemade dishes. Service was great. We had a very sweet man that tended to us. I got the impression while we were there that they do a heavy volume of take out. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Great find! This little gem has amazzzzing food, but the environment could use a little help! I'd say it's perfect for take out tacos!!"}
{"text":"I had my first time at Bea Taco Town a few days ago.  I came in the middle of the lunch rush. They seem to have a good system though because the line moved well. I was watching what the waiter was bringing out and it all looked delicious.  I had a Ranchero burrito with carne asada to go.  It was delicious but I would have liked a little more meat. The hot sauce on the side was good with the heat but it still had a good flavor too.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is beyond delicious!!! If you like authentic Mexican food, then you will Love this! I used to go to Las Palmas in Brookline for their tacos.... But now I will come here due to the quality of meat being better. So tasty! Our server was super friendly as Well. The tacos were amazing as well as the choriZo & queso (with homemade chips). Definitely a wonderful addition to this community and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Taco salad includes guacamole, which is awesome. It comes in a fried tortilla bowl. The salad was unique from other taco salads because it was pretty much 33% lettuce, 33% rice, 33% beans. Personally, I prefer more lettuce than the rice. The chicken was a little disappointing- pretty bland/one-dimensional (salt). The tomato vinaigrette that came with it had only a small hint of heat, but the taco salad itself had enough salt that I didn't have to use it.  The Guacamole + chips is $8, which I thought was pretty steep for the amount of guacamole I got. It was one of those Chipotle guac cups, but literally only 75% full. The chips (presumably fried in lard/oil) were good.   Lunchtime rush is real, and there are quite a few tables. You order at the register, grab a number, and someone delivers your food. You do not have to clean up after yourself either."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, some of the best tacos in the Pittsburgh area. The wait staff is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"MUUUUY BIEN!  Got the Cochinita ranchero burrito and it was delicious!!!! Great portion size, too!  Will def come back!"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Mexican good.   Service was really good and they happily served us even though we came close to closing time.   I love that they have carne asada, which many Mexican places in Pittsburgh don't. Enchiladas and tacos were both amazing-- will come back again.   Wish it were open during the weekend or with later hours during the week."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a friend during the week. After reading other reviews, we met around 11:30am to try to beat the crowd. Walked in and the place was almost empty. I ordered the Mexican salad with Chips and Guac while my friend ordered a chicken chimichanga. Both were excellent. The guacamole was on point! By the time we were ready to leave there was a line out the door. Good thing we got there early! I've already told my coworkers that I've found us a new authentic Mexican lunch spot."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh taqueria in the heart of downtown. I was so pleasantly surprised with this place. Order the Mexican Salad - it is excellent and very filling (think Chipotle Burrito Bowl). Seating is limited (the local lunch crowd fills this place up very quickly), but a takeout lunch from here has become a monthly routine."}
{"text":"I was SO excited when they opened up another location, this time near my home, especially since I no longer work downtown. The seating area is a bit larger and more open than the downtown location, and though it is a little bare inside- there are still some colorful Mexican decorations throughout and flat screen televisions in the dining area.  The food is very fresh and flavorful, and the portions are very generous. The food takes a bit long, but once it comes out hot and fresh, I forgave them immediately!! I got the taco salad in a taco bowl.  Also, the chips and salsa to hold us over while our food was being prepared were delicious and the salsa was the best I have had.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and ordered a shrimp and a barbacoa taco along with some chips and guacamole.    The chips and guac were great.  I would've been even more pleased if the guac had a little kick to it but it was fresh tasting and flavorful nonetheless.  On to the tacos...maybe I ordered the wrong type, but the shrimps were rubbery and half the shell was left on one of the shrimps which was an unpleasant surprise.  The barbacoa beef wasn't very flavorful and the tacos in general tasted \"dry\".  I smothered the hot sauce on them which helped a bit but not by much.  The hot sauce was good.  It got real crowded and we got there a little before noon.  Line was out the door!  Probably won't be my first choice for lunch around town but I might try again and order something different."}
{"text":"Got the OMG tacos and they're probably some of the best tacos I've ever had. Great flavor and consistency and the meat in the taco was good as well. Definitely recommend the tacos."}
{"text":"Definitely exceeded my expectations! Went in for a quick bite and got 2 tacos. One carne asada and one barbacoa. The barbacoa was just ok. A little dry but the carne asada was so flavorful! Their chips and salsa is fresh and delicious! Wanted to try the naked burrito so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to find this little gem downtown. It is going into my lunch out rotation. I ordered a chorizo burrito as a test run and it was great! I brought it back to my desk and ate it in less than 5 minutes. I need to go back and savor it! There was a great variety of meats to choose from, my husband is partial to tongue. Try out Bea Taco Town, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's totally worth stopping by this local Mexican food chain, which is just as good or better than the Chipotle and Moe's a few blocks away. Everything is delicious and well-presented for fast food. I like to get the \"naked\" burrito which is served over romaine lettuce, sans tortilla. I've had great experiences with the service too; everyone is friendly and you are served quickly."}
{"text":"This place is my new passion! Pittsburgh has had quite a number of Mexican restaurants popping up in and out of the city. But most that I have tried have been disappointing. Bea's Taco Town is not a disappointment.  The menu is small the service is fast and the food is tasty. I ordered the chicken dorado's with refried black beans and both were very good and satisfying. The food also comes with a sauce on the side which I believe is a hot sauce. I was not afraid to pour this sauce on everything. Very tasty. I highly recommend anyone working in town to stop by on their lunch break."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly service.  Tacos are fresh and made to order with the perfect amount of seasoning and spices.  Guacamole is good, very chunky (tons of tomatoes) but had good flavor.  Recommend the barbacoa tacos!"}
{"text":"The food here was ok. I had the naked chicken burrito which would have been great but it was overpowered by lime juice completely. The service was friendly and food came out quickly. It did the trick in curbing our hunger, but I won't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Came here on a dinner date with my son. We were really excited to try this place out. When we entered, we were facing their kitchen. There are tables in a smaller room the the right and then a bigger dining room to the left. We were sat immediately, the bigger dining room had a good amount of people in it.   The menu was not extensive, but it we still took a while to choose. We started with the chips, queso, and guacamole. We ordered an extra hot salsa, which was fantastic and spicy!     My son ordered the original burrito with nothing on it, only the chicken, beans and rice inside. It was delicious! The chicken was perfectly seasoned and the burrito itself was big! But of course this lil guy finished it! The server said she'd never seen a kid finish one like that before, so obviously he enjoyed it!    I ordered their potosinas with chicken. It was served with black beans and a lite Mexican rice. The potosinas were wrapped in corn tortillas with chicken, smothered in queso with slices of avocados, sour cream and pico de gallo. This was by far my favorite Mexican dish I have had in quite some time!    Over all, our experience was lovely. The server was extremely kind and attentive. The food was great! The prices were a little steep, but the quality of the food was very good."}
{"text":"Good stuff.  Appparently , they used to be in south side.  Good tacos and burritos.  Not a bad price.  Convenient for USX tower, as it's right across from wiener world.  (I can't bring myself to beat there...)  The cooks speak no English.  So that's a good sign."}
{"text":"I've seen this place a million times. I never stopped because I thought another place that will leave.  I thought it was great. I had a burrito and it was big and good. I'm Happy I went. I will return."}
{"text":"Unique menu.  Many meat options. Easy,  casual setting. *don't be upset that you don't get free chips and salsa, and be happy you had room for your awesome meal you ordered!"}
{"text":"Terrible Service, Took 15 minutes to get one burrito between lunch and dinner rush... They're burritos are mostly rice - easy way to save money - skimp on chicken and peppers and other such fixings. Honestly, it wasn't a terrible burrito for being 90% rice, but at the end of the day, as burritos go, a 90% rice burrito isn't great"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner after the place we had intended to go was closed. We are pretty happy that we did too. Our waiter was really nice and struggled with his English but was helpful none the less. Towards the end of our visit three guys walked in who were extremely rude to the waiter because he had a hard time understanding them. The whole time he remained polite, while they cussed and ran their mouth.   The highlight of our visit for me was the Al Pastor tacos. I had 3 of them and a couple other tacos. They were some of the best al pastor tacos I've had. The tortilla were also delicious. I've had plenty of street tacos that just had to grainy of a texture. These were perfect. They filled the tacos well and didn't skimp on the meat.   Definitely a place I would stop at again next time I come through town. After seeing how the staff handled some wanna be gangstas in this small Pittsburgh suburb, and the fact that the next day I am craving more of their tacos. I gotta give it a 5 star."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch. The prices are very reasonable. I was very underwhelmed by chips and salsa that I started with. The salsa was like water and I couldn't identify any tomatoes. For $3, I expected a better quality. But things got much better with the tacos I ordered. The chorizo and tacos as pastor were excellent! And the soft corn tortillas were very good too. I would definitely go back. I'll probably just skip the salsa next time. Margaritas would really be a great option but I don't know if/when they will be serving alcohol."}
{"text":"Bea's is fantastic if you want authentic fresh Mexican! Takeout or sitdown. Everyone is extremely friendly! The food is always made so quickly. I love that this location is here. I always eat at the downtown location for lunch and then I can eat at the Banksville location for dinner! You can't order a bad thing off the menu - it's ALL good."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for a quick and relatively inexpensive lunch! I had the $3 barbacoa taco, and shared an order of shrimp & tilapia enchiladas with a friend.  Both were excellent, and we enjoyed the hot sauce that was served on the side.  Not only was this sauce hotter than most you can get at a restaurant, it also had a lot of flavor! I could probably eat here every day of the week and order something different. Everything on the menu looked delicious!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've found in town.  I've been here twice and love the tacos.  I had the alpastor, barbacoa and carnitas. All had great distinctive flavors and reminded me of the Mexican food I used to get when I lived in Texas.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Went to this place for a quick dinner after running some errands down town. I got the chicken quesadilla and chips and salsa. The food came out super quick. I really enjoyed the salsa, it's a little runny and the chips are thin and crispy. The chicken quesadilla was delicious and came with some guacamole, sour cream, and salsa. Very good place and priced very reasonable."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?! This place has it going on ! Their mahi mahi taco is out of this world ! Guacamole was fresh and delicious! My husband loves the beef taco!!! This was our first visit but definitely not our last! Courteous and friendly staff- clean and great service! Best Mexican food around!"}
{"text":"Really great shot for lunch tacos. They had a great selection of meats to choose from as well as some vegetarian options to boot.   I had the chicken tacos which were delicious. They were well seasoned and served with rice and beans. The homemade hit sauce was terrific adding the perfect level of heat. I will definitely be trying more tacos from here."}
{"text":"The food was just average, staff are very friendly. Good to have a mex restaurant close by."}
{"text":"My wedding anniversary is on Cinco de Mayp. We didn't plan it that way but it brings fun to the day. Usually we go somewhere fancy to celebrate but we LOVE Mexican food and kept hearing great things about this place so we mixed things up and went for our anniversary dinner. We were celebrating 26 years together with guacamole!!  They do not have their liquor license yet but since it was Cinco de Mayo they were giving each customer a free Corona. I'm not a beer drinker so I passed on the offer. Lots of patrons were excited about the free beer.  I ordered the Shredded Chicken Taquitos. It came with black beans and a Spanish rice. The beans were whole and not received which I really liked. I'm not a big rice fan but I took a few bites before letting the hubby finish it. The Taquitos were bigger than I thought they would be. The outside was very crispy and the chicken inside was very juicy. It was topped with guacamole, lettuce, and a bit of sour cream.  They had a lot of flavor. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. My husband got the Ranchero Burrito we usually share but much to my dismay the sauce was too spicy for me. My husband ate the whole thing and was sweating a little bit. LOL I think we have just found our new go to Mexican place. Happy Cinco de Mayo!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by and got myself some take-out tacos. I ordered 2 Mahi Mahi Baja tacos with black beans  ($9) and Chips and Queso ($5).   A smiling server took my order right away, and I sat at the bar while a gentleman grilled up the fish and assembled my tacos right in front of me. Then, I paid and was out the door. The whole process only took about 10 minutes.   The queso wasn't anything special but the tacos were really good and decently sized for the price. The black beans were also flavored well.   I'm a happy customer and I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"When we first arrived, we were asked if we wanted chips.  Assuming they were free, we ordered them.  Charge for chips with watery salsa and delicious guacamole was 5.00.  Quesidilla was delicious and filled with high quality meat."}
{"text":"I stopped by to test it out since I was in the area. I've been to other Mexican joints emphatically recommended by friends only to be disappointed, so naturally I was skeptical. I only got a taco (with pulled chicken cooked in chipotle.) I just wanted a sample, after all.  Wow, it was fantastic!  It was undoubtedly the best taco I have had since a kid in the 1970s at Azteca in Garden Grove, CA.    I will be back with the family."}
{"text":"The food was really great and fresh. The atmosphere is nice and the restaurant is clean. Good place for a quick lunch with great food. There is no restroom in the restaurant for customers to my knowledge."}
{"text":"I've eaten Bea's twice now, first dining in & then ordered on GrubHub. Dining in was better, which makes sense I guess. The taquitos are pretty good, the quesadilla not my fave. I'd try it again, but only if my dining partner really wanted to go & was being annoying about it."}
{"text":"Went today for the first time.  Best Mexican Downtown."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Bea's today. I've past this place up too many times because every time I thought of doing lunch here,  the line seemed incredibly long. There was a bit of a line today but not quite as bad as other times I've walked past (must have been the cold weather that kept some away today).   I ordered a ground beef taco and a chorizo taco. Wasn't disappointed at all. The ingredients were super fresh! And just two tacos filled me up nicely for lunch. I will definitely go back, even if the line is long, and I recommend the place to anyone who likes authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"My five stars are based solely on how delicious the vegetarian tacos are - they're so robust & tasty.  They include rice & beans, fabulous grilled poblanos with cheese melted on, and some other toppings.  They're even better when you add the medium-hot sauce that comes on the side with each order - the flavor is incredibly complex.  Love these veggie tacos so much.  (Side note, also ordered chips & salsa which were far inferior.  But the veggie tacos!!)"}
{"text":"The menu looks interesting and I heard good things about this restaurant but I was under impressed. The tacos were good but not great. Unfortunately, the image burned into my brain is of the sourpuss face of the man in charge. Not once did he smile or make good eye contact. I'm really not interested in going back."}
{"text":"So good.  If you want authentic Mexican food for a quick lunch, then this is your place!  I have yet to have anything less than stellar.  They have vegetarian and a wide variety of meat options.  The shredded chicken on a burrito is my fav! They tortilla chips are good, but could be a little saltier."}
{"text":"I don't like fake wanna-be Mexican restaurants.  You know, like Taco Bell or Don Pablo's.  \"Mexican Inspired\" food.  Bleh!   So one day, I really had a taste for Mexican food and I had heard about Bea Taco Town.  Very easy to walk to from my job and very reasonably priced.  I ordered several tacos, rice and beans for my first visit.  The cochinita pibil (slow-cooked pork in orange sauce) taco and the tinga de pollo (shredded chicken) taco were pretty tasty.  I also enjoyed the rice and beans.  They also provide you with a small serving of sauce to go with your meal which was also tasty and definitely had a kick to it.  (I thinks that it's their version of pico, but I have never seen liquidy pico de gallo before.)  On another visit I had the Enchiladas Suizas with chicken and that was pretty tasty too.  I usually get my orders to go so that I can be as messy as I need to be when getting down with my lunch.  Once my co-workers smelled my food they asked me where I got my Mexican stash from.  I told them, \"Bea Taco Town\" and now we have several Bea Taco Town addicts in my office.  The service is very fast and everything is extremely fresh and it taste much more authentic than other Downtown Pittsburgh Mexican or \"Mexican Inspired\" restaurants.  Muy sabroso!"}
{"text":"Good stuff!! Great vegetarian options as well. While they have a vegetarian menu with three of the options, I really think you could get anything on the menu and sub in beans. I got the veggie burrito and added fries to make it like a California burrito and it was pretty great. Also only cost about 8-10 bucks for great portion sizes. Hot sauce is super spicy!  Loved it.   No cups for water so bring your own of plan on buying a drink."}
{"text":"It was good, if not spectacular. I would go there again. The decor could use an upgrade down the line."}
{"text":"Really good fresh authentic tex mex.  The lunchtime crowd says it all. They recently changed the menu and it is a bit more expensive, but well worth it.  I especially like the enchiladas suizas.  Don't confuse it with the chain text mex spots."}
{"text":"I love this place. I eat lunch here at least once a week. The ranchero burrito with chicken is the best thing on the menu. It is best burrito you can get around here. The tacos are also great. I'd recommend the picadillo tacos."}
{"text":"As long as you do not care that you will have to wait for this delicious food this place is a fantastic spot for lunch. And if you do need lunch on the go I would just suggest not coming here around 12. I've had two things from here so far and both of them have been delicious. The atmosphere is a little divey but that it makes it even better and it feels good inside. There's a lot of hustle and bustle from employees and patrons alike. And no one really has a problem waiting for this delicious food.  The first time that I came here I got the fish tacos. You can order the tacos by how many you want and I only ordered two. Bad idea they were so good I should have probably ordered ten I got black beans instead of the rice choice and I still believe that was the right decision. The fish were crispy and delicious and super flavorful. They gave me a side sauce that I liked but it was a little bit spicy so just in case that orange sauce if you don't like spice this might not be the best for you. But those fish tacos were amazing. I would get them again in a second.   I've only eaten out and taken all of my food to go so I don't know how it is eating in the restaurant. As long as you are okay with people standing around while you eat waiting for their food it's not that bad. The tables are bust very fast and the food seems to be coming flying out of that kitchen. The food is just so good that I'm so many people order so that's why sometimes it takes awhile to get to you but don't worry it will come.  I will also say that the prices are very reasonable and they do take cards. Sometimes spots like this are hit-and-miss with taking the credit cards with this place takes them with no problem. This is a great place to go downtown to eat and to get your Mexican fix in. Try it out if you have some time."}
{"text":"Finally found a place that has California burrito!! It's pretty good! Their hot sauce is really spice and delicious! Found my New Mexican food place!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican spot!! Tacos were delicious, we will be coming back for this, did not disappoint.  Staff is helpful and courteous.  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Called in and ordered take out.  Was told 10 to 15 minutes.  So when I got there in 10 minutes they were preparing our order.  The front looks into a kitchen area and there was confusion.  A few other take outs and many servers standing around trying to get the orders straight.  No real system so once you get your order they then take 10 minutes to ring up your order.  This happened to a few other take out orders in front of me.  The kitchen staff seemed confused on what containers to put the food in and transferred a few?   As to the food had the chips and salsa which were good and some tacos.  The salsa is a little more liquid than I like has fresh cilantro and enjoyable.  Had a Bisteck ala Mexicana taco..the beef was overcooked and it was OK, and a Carnitas taco that was OK."}
{"text":"The food is very good but the customer service is abhorrent. I had placed an order for a party tray to feed an office party and I guess the staff didn't expect me to be fluent in Spanish as I got to listen to them swear and call me horrible names because I asked for something on the side. It disgusting and offensive. I will never go to this place again. Pittsburgh has many other Mexican places that will take my money and not call me names to face thinking that I wouldn't understand them"}
{"text":"This is a convenient spot downtown to grab a quick lunch. It's tucked away or I think it would get a lot more hype. There is some seating inside but I opted to grab and go. Very quick service - I ordered at the counter and only waited MAYBE 5 minutes for my tacos! These people are quick at lunch hour. I had 2 of the vegetarian tacos - so very good. I wished I had gotten 3! They aren't too large so if you are very hungry, I'd suggest getting 3 or get 2 and a side. They were very spicy - not for the weak."}
{"text":"After having seen the demise of two 'Soul Food' restaurants in this space over the course of four months, heartbroken that they couldn't make them go and missing the fried chicken like mad, I was happy to see something else 'small' open in this site.   I had gone once with a co-worker and didn't actually order anything, but this past week decided to give it a go. I was sick of my leftovers, and wanted something different.  I used to occasionally hit the Qdoba, and although they do tend to be big and flavorful, they also tend to be much bigger in price tag than they need to be. They recently eased up on that by making things that used to be outrageously 'extra' not extra, but a burrito still comes with a hefty price tag.  Bea's offers a basic line of Burritos, enchiladas, tacos and quesadillas. They have their own creations, and the basics.   For my first go, I opted for the basic 'original' burrito. I had a choice of meats, so I chose steak. (Actually, according to the hand written paper on the wall, I had my choice of 'meet').   It was about the same size as Qdoba, stuffed with rice, beans, guacamole and steak, a little cheese, and came with a side of some kind of sauce that was tasty, though not too zingy.  After I'd placed my order and paid, THEN I noticed another paper sign on the wall for nachos, but since I'd already paid, I decided not to try. They really could work on consolidating their signage a bit.   I got my burrito back to the office and devoured it in about five minutes.   And I am torn.  The price is about the same, now that Qdoba has eased up on their 'extras'. But the flavor, though pretty much probably bioengineered at a chain like Qdoba, IS more flavorful.   Bea was a little bland. They could toss in a few more seasonings and I'd be hooked. Kick it up with some true Mexican hot sauces, and I'd definitely be hooked.  But I suppose my bottom line...support local. Additionally, although I know the holiday spirit nonsense, I wasn't too keen about Qdoba giving a portion of sales to Catholic Charities this past year. That prevented me from going at all.   Bea does have seating, and everyone was very nice. The check out gal (Bea?) is a stunning woman reminiscent of early 80's new wave style. Another plus? The kitchen crew actually appears to be...Mexican, or at the very least of some Hispanic extraction. That's a plus. They also have a cooler stocked with a variety of Latin culture beverages, in addition to the usuals. They also take credit cards.  So flip that coin...but end its flight in mid-air. Buy local. Check out Bea's."}
{"text":"After reading decent reviews my husband and I decided to order takeout from here. We both got burritos and wow, how disappointing. $11 for a tortilla over stuffed with rice. Both of our burritos had little to no meat. I kept biting into mine waiting for the chicken. I ended up having three bites of chicken out of a huge burrito. Menu said refried beans came on the side (neither of us got beans). No flavor in either of our burritos whatsoever. It all seemed bland, boring, and WAY overpriced. Extremely disappointed. Taco Bell would have been better than this place."}
{"text":"Very good flavor for reasonable prices. Menu items are very authentic and the staff is very friendly. Everything seems fresh"}
{"text":"This place has legit Mexican food! I stopped in to the Smithfield with a friend for lunch during the week. It's a small joint with about 25 seats. When you enter you stand in line to order your food before sitting. I ordered the OMG Tacos, one steak one pork. These were incredible! Very nice seized tacos, lots of meat, guac and pico. I also loved the soft corn tortillas they use. I ordered a side of rice and beans w/ chorizo, then found out the tacos come with beans and chorizo. The pineapple added a nice sweet touch, and I haven't seen any other Mexican place in Pittsburgh serve cactus. I'd put this place in the top 3 taco spots in Pittsburgh. I can't wait to go back and try more of their food!"}
{"text":"This is one of three locations of this chain with the other two being downtown and near Station Square. If you are driving away from the city there is a barrier to prohibit you from making a left turn to enter. I would advise to go to next traffic light where there is a left turn signal to enter Kuhn's Market and turn around.  Upon arrival the place was basically empty. I was asked if I wanted to eat in or take out. I chose to eat in. Since I like fish tacos I asked about them and was told they were very good. The fish they use is mahi mahi. I didn't have to wait long for my meal to be served. The tacos come in two soft shells, the fish lay on a bed of rice with guacamole sauce on it. They give you a side of sauce. My error in that I didn't test it out first to learn it was a hot sauce. The meal also comes with a side of black beans. I did like the fact the tacos were soft. It can get a bit messy but everything was cooked to order.  I found the fish tacos to be just okay since I'm not used to eating them mixed with rice. You get two to a plate which is enough for me. Over at the next table someone had ordered a taco salad which I was also thinking about. He said it was very good. Prices are reasonable so you can get a decent meal for a decent price.   My waiter was very attentive to my needs and saw to it my drinks were refilled. This place is small so it is easy to miss. It is located near Potomac Road on Banksville Road.  Next time I come I will try the more traditional taco or maybe a burrito."}
{"text":"By far the best authentic Mexican I've had since visiting So Cal! Had the California steak burrito. Had them hold the fries though...if your down town near Smithfield, try it, you gonna like it. Oh yeah, fast and friendly service n at."}
{"text":"I've been to the downtown location a number of times, but this location is very close to my office.  My dining out budget will now be shot soon.  Food is fantastic, staff very friendly and the restaurant is clean.  highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Shrimp traditional tacos the best ! Corn tortillas were fresh and tasty. Wait staff were so helpful. Eco friendly all fiood served on metal trays hardly any waste just taco papers and  napkins . Hot sauce was a must.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Not very friendly.  Messed up my Grubhub order and acted upset with me, the customer, like I was responsible for their mistake.  Refused to send the missing items back out, and told us to talk to GrubHub directly, although we had already paid for the items.  I would advise not to order carry out unless you want a side of headache and to feel unfulfilled."}
{"text":"I stopped in for takeout last week for tacos, thought they were great. I got American style on corn tortillas. Decent size too unlike some of the \"trendy\" spots. Chips and salsa excellent as well, will stop again soon"}
{"text":"I have a very serious Taco Town addiction. This has become a mandatory stop at least once a week for my work friend Ashley L. and I. This place takes tacos to a whole new level!  Part of the appeal is that the service is extremely quick, and the lady who takes the orders (I swear she never gets a day off!) is pleasant and doesn't miss a beat. It's a good option for workday lunches. Sometimes we take it to go, other times we will eat in the restaurant. It isn't anything fancy, just some tables and chairs, but it gets the job done. The focus should be on the food anyway, right?  My favorites so far are the chorizo and the carnitas. The chorizo is spicy, but not too much so that it overpowers the other flavors. The carnitas is tender and packed with flavor. Everything is always served piping hot, the onions and tomatoes are fresh, and rice and beans (if you like them) are a great addition to make the tacos a little more filling. They give you an amazing sauce on the side, and are even thoughtful enough to include lime wedges even when you're ordering for take-out.  I say in complete honesty that I could probably eat here every day and not get sick of it. I should mention that the menu goes way beyond tacos, and some day I might try some of the other items... maybe. Definitely worth a stop if you work downtown or are in the area for lunch!"}
{"text":"FINALLY...an AUTHENTIC taqueria in downtown Pittsburgh!!!!  The food is absolutely out of this world delicious!! I honestly can not say enough about the quality of the menu. All fresh ingredients, made to order selections that made me feel like I was on vacation in Mexico. This quaint little place has atmosphere and yum rolled into one. Food is better than some I've had in Mexico. The owner, Bea is personable, friendly and kind.  Everyone needs to experience the goodness!"}
{"text":"Solid Mexican option around where I live. I wanted to update my review to leave my gluten free/celiac feedback here!  They use the same warmer to heat up the corn and flour tortilla, so you can't even get the corn option if you're celiac or super sensitive to gluten. I wish they didn't do that, but I SUPER appreciate the guy I talked to on the phone being thorough and telling me that! Also, they fry their chips in the same fryer as gluten, so it's a no go on chips. They also cook their shrimp and fish in that fryer, even if it isn't fried, so don't get those either if you're sensitive. Again, glad to have the heads up!  So naked steak burrito it is. It was really flavorful and hit the spot for my Mexican food cravings. I really like their guacamole, although be warned that it is very onion heavy. So if you don't like onions, you might not like it. I like the salsa, but it's the thinner version and I like mine chunkier. I'm not hip to what's authentic, so perhaps the thinner salsa is more authentic?"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here today.  Ordered the Carne Asada, Barbacoa and Carnitas tacos and everything was very fresh and delicious.  Glad to have this addition to the downtown lunch options."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Very authentic and very affordable. My coworkers and I have tried about a half dozen things off of their menu and each was delicious, filling, fresh and well priced. They take orders over the phone for quick pick up."}
{"text":"This is Mexican food at its best. Very good everything was fresh. The tacos are out of this world. I had the big burrito and it was excellent. This is going to be my new spot. I'm glad I live very close..."}
{"text":"I love authentic Mexican food and this place delivers that. The cashier was incredibly friendly, and helpful when customers asked for a description of the menu. The food came out fast and fresh. I ordered the queso and chips to start. They were okay, not too flavorful and no salt on the chips. My meal was the vegetarian burrito. It was big and tasty. I read what was in the burrito and thought it was pretty basic, but the way that they cook the peppers was amazing. They were freshly roasted and kind of smokey. I would say it was one of the best burritos I've ever had. Good job, friends. Just work on that queso and chip game."}
{"text":"NOTE- this review is for the new Banksville location which does not have a yelp page as of yet.  Yesterday, I visited the brand brew Bea Taco Town located on Banksville road for their grand opening. I was originally intrigued to go as I had heard so many good things about their downtown location and because they had a sign stating that items were 50% off during their opening.    I arrived around 1:30pm for lunch and it wasn't quite busy at that time, but did start to fill up as I was eating. Actually, by the time I left the entire place was full (there are two sides a small area with seating and also a larger main area).   In general, the service was very fast and friendly and the food was okay- I had chicken enchiladas with red sauce and a side of rice and refried black beans. The beans were my favorite part and everything else was just okay, as mentioned. Not great, not bad,  just okay. Although, My fiancé had chicken and steak street tacos and he said he really enjoyed them and they were very fresh.   The restaurant itself seems to be a mish mash of items from the previous restaurant that has been repurposed with new (bright orange and green) paint. Although, this eclectic type style may be what they're going for so I'm  not knocking them.   One thing I didn't like was that the menus were paper copies that were handwritten, so it made it very difficult to read and interpret. I wish they would have just typed something up and printed those out.   Overall my experience here was again just okay. Nothing bad happened but I wasn't really blown away. Finally, when the bill came the only items that were 50% off were the street tacos, not my meal, so I thought the sign they had out front was a bit contradictory. If you're going to run specials on select items you need to be more specific so that people's expectations of what they are paying is clear."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to get my taco on! I met my gf for lunch on a Friday at 11:50. When I pulled up I was concerned the building was closed. They were weren't. I just happened to be the first arrival for lunch.   I was seated quickly & my server encouraged me to download their app. Upon doing so a complimentary serving of chips and salsa arrived at the table. (Score!) the salsa and chips are tasty! (Double Score!) The thin salsa is fresh with just a mild amount of heat. A perfect start to a lunch. Not too much overpowering spice. I didn't have to guzzle water after each bite and instead could continue consuming fistfuls of chips with salsa. A good indicator to just the right amount of spice and fresh ingredients.   When my friend arrived the staff quickly took our order. They were aware that her lunch break time was limited. Staff was very aware of our needs & the time.  As it was our first visit we decided to try the tacos because we could order multiple style of tacos a la cart.   We ordered 3 tacos each. Each taco was between $3-3.50. I chose the chicken, shrimp, and fish. My friend chose pork, another version of chicken, and something else. The idea was we'd get a wide taste of their taco variety.   What really happened was this-  The taco's are HUGE. I ate 1/2 of my fish taco and realized I was getting full. I then had a bite of the chicken and a bit of the shrimp. That was it. It was SUPERB. It's not a bad thing the foods delicious and plentiful. Prepare to take home leftovers or try not to over order like we did!   Sadly because of this day's work, I was unable to bring leftovers home. I'm still craving more of the fish taco. It is flaky, lightly breaded, and flash fried then served in a double tortilla, with fresh pico, and guacamole. I don't even like guac but this guac was not bad at all. And for me to say that is saying A LOT!   Each taco arrived with guacamole. I don't care for guac and wasn't expecting its presence.  As for the Chicken Taco. Not having the room to indulge in it's Chipotle goodness was truly a shame. The pulled chicken served in a double corn taco was delicious and it will be a regular treat soon enough.  Delicious! Absolutely Fantastic!   Now the Shrimp. By the time I tried the shrimp, I was just filled to the brim and could only pop a few shrimp into my mouth before calling it a day.  The shrimp were delicious. Grilled and perfectly seasoned.   Overall, I have no regrets about my first trip to Bea.  I wish I could have eaten more and longer because the meal served to us was superb!  The atmosphere is casual and comfortable. Food was perfect. It's now my favorite place to order Taco's from.  Thank goodness we found it!  I am going to be brutally honest, we had been spending a lot of time making reservations at the trendy tako place downtown that makes me wait 30 minutes to go to the bathroom and leaves us with at least a $100 bill. BeaTaquria has food that is MUCH tastier. They don't have the bar scene or a DJ spinning while you're eating but the food is much better. Your taste buds & wallet will thank you for making this you're new favorite place for really good taco's. (and other food!)"}
