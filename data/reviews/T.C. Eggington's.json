{"text":"T.C. Eggington's is the standard to live up to for breakfast places in the Phoenix area, and they set the bar high. (Crackers being a close second.) It has always been our go to choice for taking out of towners out for a great breakfast or brunch. Details matter, and little things like fresh flowers and carafes of iced tea and water, so you don't have to wait for a refill, do not go unnoticed. The atmosphere is sunny and pleasant. 
   The breakfast menu is legendary, and I've enjoyed many a wonderful omelet here. But many may not realize, they have a very good lunch menu, also. Today, I enjoyed the 5 cheese grilled sandwich....with bacon, tomato and just enough fresh jalapeño to give it a nice kick. It may be the best grilled cheese sandwich I have ever had.....A grilled cheese for grownups.  My husband had a blueberry smoothie and the \" ultimate BLT\" , a BLT with egg salad....both his favorites in one great sandwich. 
    Can't wait to return....we won't wait for those \"out of towners\", we'll just come on our own."}
{"text":"Just made reservations which made realize I should review them since we love this place!

We have been coming here since moving to the east valley 10 years ago. 

The breakfasts here are really good!  Omelets, girdle cakes, parlour creations, egg cetera and frittatas. Best French Toast ever!! The cinnamon rolls are very good too. We always have left overs so it's like getting two breakfasts for the price of one.  

I honestly can't comment on lunch because I have only eaten breakfast but based on that I would bet lunch is great too.

Servers are all clean cut, preppy looking, and VERY attentive...which is good because TCE is always packed.  They do take reservations which is good because you will need them on any holiday. 

See you there Friday!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Seriously never had a better breakfast. The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because the female server was rude and abrupt. I noticed the other staff members were extremely friendly, but she was not."}
{"text":"This place is the best breakfast place here in Phoenix/Mesa. Worth the drive from any place in the valley as it does not get better than TC Eggington's! I will say that adding Biscuits and Gravy would be a wonderful thing! This could possible send me over the top if they added it! As many like Gravy with breakfast! But that should not stop you from enjoying a fantastic staple in the east valley... A little place that has consistant food and is well taken care of by it's owners! TC can be crazy at times peak breakfast hours and holidays so... Plan ahead and make a reservation! Its worth it!"}
{"text":"Man oh man this place was really good! I went with my dad for breakfast and I had the Greek Fetash omelet. I was SO good! I wish we had an egg place like this in Flagstaff! I really liked the feta cheese (the amount and taste) the best on the omelet, I did pick off the artichoke hearts on top of the omelet, I thought they would come inside but it was still really good. Also the omelet came with an English muffin and breakfast potatoes. Breakfast potatoes were great and what made the English muffin was the apple cinnamon jelly! Oh my gosh it was REALLY good! You can by the jelly at the hostess station I think, I saw jars and they looked like they were for sell. Next time I think I will have to buy a jar! I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"The BEST breakfast I've ever eaten. I had the Benedict with spinach tomato and avocado. The hollandaise sauce was wonderful. Good coffee, very nice atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"This place is just great!! Been here several  times and it has never disappointed. I love ordering a fresh baked muffin everytime I go there with a some coffee while I decide on my meal. The muffin is always fresh and steaming and the coffee has a fresh brewed taste. Breakfast portions are quite large and wholesome. Last visit there I have the Eggs Benedict and a blueberry muffin. Everything was superb. My girlfriend had an order of French toast with a side of eggs and bacon. The French toast were huge and plentiful. There were about 5-6 giant strips of bacon in the side and what seamed to be 2-3 eggs( they were order scrambled) everything was great :).. If I could eat here on a daily trust me I would lol.. It's a pleasant place to go visit for some great wholesome food on a early mid morning day."}
{"text":"Little did I know that the thing to do after going to Mass at St. Tim's is breakfast at TC Eggington's...

That being said, it makes for a crowd and a wait; however, ...TOTALLY WORTH IT! Plus, you can call in and put your name down ahead. This morning I called at 7 this morning for our 10AM breakfast, was bumped to 10:15 (doable), and ended up beating the rush and sneaking in just before 10 anyway.

Breakfast here is delicious. Delicious! We have tried:

Hilltop Acres -- excellent combination of veg, skillet style
Crack o' Dawn -- nicely basted eggs on top (as has the Hilltop Acres)
The Eggington Omelet -- hesitated because of the cream cheese inside, but its blend with the chicken, broccoli, and hollandaise is tasty!
Crab Stuffed Pastry -- perfectly crispy pastry shells full of crab, artichoke hearts, basted eggs, and hollandaise? Yes, please!!

Much happier waiting for breakfast here than going to any of the other breakfast chains in the area."}
{"text":"By far, the best place around for breakfast or lunch. The ambiance is charming, the service is great, but it's really all about the food.  Wow!! Whatever you order will be wonderful. Tom (the owner) is always there and takes personal interest in his customers."}
{"text":"This is always a great breakfast. My personal favorite at the moment is the Greek Fetash and the Farmer's Market Ben E. Dict.
 A work of caution though concerning the crab dishes. I asked the waitress what kind of crab was used, since I used to get a Snow Crab omelette at another place in San Diego, and she said it was imitation crab meat. Uh, that's not crab meat , it's Whitefish. If you're going to use imitation crab meat then call it what it is. 
None the less, T.C.'s is still a great breakfast but get there before 9AM or you'll be waiting for a table. That's always a good sign of a place to eat.

Edit 12 Feb 2013. 
A few things that should be mentioned. Be careful going from the little side parking lot to the restaurant. There are some steps that aren't marked and are the same concrete gray as the rest of the slab. This goes for the step up on the curb also.  The landlord really should paint those steps yellow as there are a large number of seniors that frequent T.C.'s and this could become a huge negligence issue, especially now that I've posted it on the internet.

Another issue that came up, since there's a lot of seniors that go there is the generous food portions. This is great for the twenty something crowd but for what appears to be a large number of seniors that go there TC's really needs a Seniors Menu. It's time they survey the demographic of their clientele or even a simple informal survey mentioned at the door."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good meal with solid service you'll find it here.  The menu has something for everyone, too.  If you like to go out for lunch or brunch, this is a great place to go.  Friendly, fast staff helps make the experience that much better."}
{"text":"I had a seriously solid breakfast here. On a Tuesday morning around 8:45 it wasn't busy, but there was a solid stream of customers. I can see how another reviewer referred to TC Eggington's as \"country-clubby\" -- all the servers wear these terribly unflattering khaki shorts and a pastel polo tucked in plus the people sitting at the table next to me were talking about golf. I'm not a golfer myself (well, disc golf, but that's hardly the same), but I still felt comfortable here. 

On to the food -- I ordered an O'pear omelet after much deliberation. The eggs were cooked perfectly... still soft, but not undercooked -- and the amount and ratio of one filling to the next was perfect. Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner! My only complaint would be that the melon that came on the side was a big slice that still had the rind on it. I love that it was obviously freshly sliced, but it was a little difficult to eat. 

The service was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. If it wasn't edging 90 degrees I might have sat outside. Next time I'm in town I'm going to have to try the French toast..."}
{"text":"What a delicious, delightful surprise! Our Scottsdale friends kept telling us we'd be having breakfast at their favorite restaurant, T.C. Eggington's, and now I know why they saved it for our last morning. Nothing else compares! 

Clean, cute cafe atmosphere (I loved the chicken wire on the menu!), a huge menu of possibilities (all unusual and yummy sounding), good service and home-baked goodness down to the English muffin. 

I ordered the O'Pear Grenache Omelette based on recommendations from my friends AND the waiter. Here's the description: \"How sweet it is...A subtle mix of bosc pear slices, melted Havarti cheese, sliced almonds  and bacon offer you an extraordinary rich flavor you're never experienced.\"

They were right. And it was SO HUGE that I couldn't finish it...though I really wanted to! (Next time, I'll order the \"reduced\" size - two instead of three eggs. I didn't know I could...or that I should!)

Everyone at the table was happy with their order. My only regret is that I don't live close enough to try all of their omelettes..."}
{"text":"I ordered the eggs Benedict and it was bland. The French toast was huge, light and airy but the syrup tasted like it was out of a Kroger brand bottle. Also the oj was not fresh, probably out of a frozen concentrate. 

The service was good and prices ok."}
{"text":"Food is decent, staff is friendly and attentive,  WORST bloody Mary I've ever had. It's like someone opened a can of Campbell's condensed tomato soup and stuck a straw in it. Also, I didn't hold it against the restaurant, but the lady behind us told a 45 minute story about brackets. Come here if you're over 55 and want to tell boring stories while eating decent food."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to TC Egginton's since I was a child, and we still make a point to come by for breakfast every weekend! The food, service, and atmosphere are all phenomenal. Everything on the menu is good, but my personal tip is to order the cordon bleu omelette. It is not on the menu anymore, but they are happy to make it for you and it is delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious and hearty breakfast dishes at a very reasonable price (around $10 USD). They have some pretty interesting dishes like their vegetarian version of eggs benedict with tomatoes and avocados was quite tasty.

The service was also top notch and although the restaurant was very busy our server checked in on us multiple times to make sure everything was okay.

Looking forward to returning someday soon!"}
{"text":"I eat at TC Eggingtons at least once a month if not more.  My office is across the street and it is one of my favorite places to go if I am eating lunch out.  I have not had anything on the menu that has not been amazing.  They are always willing to make slight alterations in the way they prepare something to help me with any crazy diet I am on. I highly recommend TC Eggingtons for brunch or just an everyday breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast spot. Everything we've had has been stellar. The crab omelet is great. The apple pecan pancakes are delicious. The coffee flows freely, and despite the Sunday barrage of bible thumpers, they'll get you in and out in a very reasonable amount of time. It's never been more than 10 minutes to get a table."}
{"text":"Was hoping for crab benedict this morning. Was beyond disappointment. Luckily found out by asking that they use fake crabmeat like the kind in a Subway sandwich. Granted Im from Maryland and acknowledge that real crabmeat is hard to come by out here. That said I found it offensive and wrong that this place has the gall to trick people by not accurately depicting what their food is.  Call it Krab on the menu if thats what you use.. Servers and staff very friendly and accomodating. Service was slow. Got the veggie benedict. Was ok but nothing special. Potatos ok. Latte was gross. This place was way overpriced for the quality of food. I wont be back. Daily Dose in Scottsdale is where to go for crab benedict"}
{"text":"Awesome Mother's Day brunch! Took 9 people in my family and everyone including picky kids loved their food! Love that they take reservations!"}
{"text":"I have been to T.C. Eggington's about a hundred times and it has always been fantastic! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast Location in the Valley of the Sun!  This is the best place to take mom on Mother's Day and well worth the drive from anywhere in town!   I first found out about TC Eggington's in an MCC Small Business class back in 1988 when the owners spoke to our class. Needless to say have been hooked ever since!  That's 24 years!!!

To start with EVERY HUGE Omelette is a must our favorites are the:

Cottage Reef:  Savory crab meat and cream cheese dipped in a rich hollandaise sauce and topped with garden fresh artichoke hearts. This comes with a mound of homemade hashbrowns and English Toast too...you will not leave hungry!  

Another favorite is the Roasted Tuscan: Fire roasted eggplant, red peppers, garlic, zucchini, topped with fresh basil, sun dried tomatoes and feta cheese!

The boys like the Piglet's Passion:  diced ham, pork, sausage, bacon, green peppers, olives, tomatoes, onions, and assorted cheeses and one omelette is big enough for two! Priced at $8.95 each.

We love to get the orchard fresh fruit platter Cantalope, grapes, Kiwi, pineapple etc. with a giant english muffin on the side for an extra buck!

The Palour Creations are just as good try the Santa Fe Sautee pepper grilled chicken or the Crack of Dawn complete in it's own pan! 

We love to get breakfast to go here on a Saturday morning and eat it with the kids at the Phoenix Zoo or Encanto Park or just before a family hike!  Cheers Here's to TC Eggington's!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. Price very reasonable. 

The menu is a little overwhelming with dish titles that require reading descriptions to make a choice."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place, bar none!  I love that it is a local, non-chain place and they do everything delicious!!  The french toast is to die for and the plain and simple (eggs, bacon, potatoes) is perfect!  My husband and I split these two dishes and it is plenty.  We always leave stuffed!!  Be sure to make reservations for a Sat or Sun morning breakfast, otherwise you'll be waiting at least an hour!!"}
{"text":"YUMMY!

Only complaint is the portions could have been  bigger, otherwise, great place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I'm preety sure this place is family owned which means decent prices and friendly staff. The problem is we seem to get waiters that are inexperienced and can forget about things from time to time. But that is nitpicking the food here is great. I have had maybe 6 to 7 different things on the menu and all of them were exactly as advertised and very good. I usually stick to the farmers Benedict which is nice and fresh. My wife enjoys their omelets and pancakes. Check out the jam on the table it is very scrumprious. Nothing crazy here just really solid American  breakfast fair."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 10 out of 5 stars but life is not  fair. My strawberry pancake was the single most amazing pancake I have ever had. The only negative I could her actualize in my mind is that I can't eat everything on the menu."}
{"text":"The management/owner is abusive to his employees. His communication skills lack integrity. He should coach his servers to excel and feel confident. He has no respect for them. You can see it on their facial expressions waiting for the next negative feedback. FYI if you do eat there have them clear your already set table. Get fresh everything all the way down to the water on the table."}
{"text":"Crab omelet? More like imitation crab meat which is really just a mix of various extra fish parts, processed and flavored like crab. When will restaurants be honest about what they serve? Its just sad."}
{"text":"Well this is the place that made me sign up for a Yelp account. Been here a handful of times now. A star for the ok to sometimes pretty good service - never terrible. 

Now, the food... It's not bad - if you're 600lbs and like to eat grease or buckets of sugar for breakfast. I've been more than once because my boyfriend sometimes enjoys southern cooking - if that tells you anything more about this place. This last time I went I got an egg white vegetable omelette because the pancakes and french toast  I had previously tried were a little too sweet and much. Sounds like a nice healthy option, right? Pretty sure they even used the word healthy on the menu's description. Hah. It was literally atop a LAKE of oil. I feel sick just thinking about it now. WHY? Why so much grease on everything here? Especially an egg white veggie omelette?? I don't get it! I used every napkin at the table and asked for more to soak some of it off my food, and still the omelette was dripping. Not an exaggeration - DRIPPING. SUCH a shame because I could tell the vegetables were fresh. And for some reason whoever dumped that crap all over the plate thought drizzling it all over the english muffin would be good too. Wtf?? There's fat American food and then there's this. I understand this place is kinda supposed to be like that - lots of hearty options, if you will? But this last time? It was just SO gross I had to mention for those who aren't interested in giving themselves heart problems with just one meal.

If no one else will say it, I will. T.C. Eggington's puts Paula Deen to shame. Just go to Denny's or Waffle House. You won't get mimosas with your meal but the food will taste the same and cost less!"}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast, I usually eat all my food but portion was too big. Great food selections next time I'll try their pancakes."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The service is always impeccable and the food is great. I would say this is my all time favorite spot for breakfast. Kudos TC's... You're the best. I would also like to say that I've been going here for close to twenty years. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Since we were on vacation, I searched Yelp for breakfast recommendations which ultimately lead us to this restaurant. I thought I had read majority of the reviews for this location; it primarily had positive descriptions about great food and a home-like environment. 
When we arrived, we were immediately seated. Our server asked us if we were ready to order and  we asked for a few more minutes. Our service rapidly went downhill from there. 
Our server did not come back for roughly fifteen minutes. She served a table across of us, possible family/friends: she took their order, brought their drinks and food before attending to our table. 
When she came back, we quickly ordered and thankfully received our order in a timely manner. That was the last time we saw her. 
At this point, our drinks were not refilled and we had to ask a hostess to refill our drink since our waitress was busy moving from table to table. I understand that the restaurant became very busy at this point but we just wanted to leave; I was ready to inform the manager at this point of our service but she finally came back. 
Bottom line: we did not tip her nor do we recommend coming here. Although the food tasted great, it's not worth the service."}
{"text":"We showed up with a party of six and were given a condescending scolding by the host for not calling ahead (it was a Tuesday). We were annoyed to the point of leaving, but then, miraculously, they were able to accommodate us, despite our brazen stupidity. 

I will say that the food was decent, though, and the server was friendly enough. 

Totally unrelated to anything: the 1989-style pleated khaki shorts that the poor staff are made to wear have got to go!  Time to modernize a little bit."}
{"text":"The outdoor seating is cozy and nice, wonderful on a nice spring morning. The sandwich I had was great and the side of fruit was really good!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town.  I've eaten breakfast here for years and it's always been amazing. I would recommend it to anybody."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. The surrounding area doesn't look like anything very special, but the inside of the restaurant was adorable. 

I went here with the boyfriend on a Thursday morning and I was surprised by how busy it was. We were seated right away, and here's my only complaint, at a table that seemed to be in a hallway. I don't like to be seated in a place that has a lot of foot traffic. There were a couple tables lined up in this 'hallway' but we were the only ones seated there. Next time I'll ask to sit on the beautiful patio or in the main dining room.

I had the French toast with a side of scrambled eggs. The order comes with three huge slices of toast, but you can substitute one of the pieces for a side. The price was around 8 dollars I believe, so it was really good. My boyfriend had an omelet and he really enjoyed it. Once again, the portion sizes were huge. You definitely get your money's worth here.

Our server was a nice girl who was very sweet. She was the one who told me I could substitute a piece of toast for a side. They were very busy but she was attentive and showed up when I needed something. We did wait quite a while for our meals, but it was pretty packed so I imagine the kitchen was pretty busy. 

Over all this place was great. My only complaint being the seating. I will definitely be going here again."}
{"text":"BNI group meets here every Wed. morning.  Had the Greek omelette and I simply loved it.  Fresh squeezed OJ as well.  The parfaits are very good too. Service is prompt and attentive."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and really enjoy the food. The service can be a little slow at times though."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot! Great food and service! Wish we could come here every weekend"}
{"text":"Where do I begin.... 

From a reservation for 15 that became 30+ 
The team here handled it flawlessly even during their busy hours... I can't Thank everyone enough... The food is delicious!!! My friends loved everything.. The service, perfect!!! 

Literally took care of us all!! 

Thank you 

This place and the staff deserves state wide if not national attention!"}
{"text":"Great diverse menu for a breakfast joint! We've been here many many times and the food is always great. Their menu is really uniquely created yet it doesn't stray into any crazy foodie territory, which is a plus for my kids.  Try the apple jam on the tables!  Great place to bring out of town guests. 
Negatives: There is always a huge crowd waiting to be seated, but the wait it fast. The \"theme\" is preppy country farmhouse and the staff wear outfits that would make an 80's Molly Ringwald proud- khaki shorts, preppy shirts, pastel socks and loafers.  
Overall, this place never disappoints and is great for a unique twist on typical brunch foods."}
{"text":"Nice place to have breakfast.  Generally good food and nice ambience."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always the right choice when deciding where to eat for brunch. I can only speak for the benedicts but when i tell you they are Done just right! I know you'll believe me the second you walk in and see the platters served. Do yourself a favor go eat there and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Strawberry pancakes were delicious! One order is big enough to feed 2 adults and a 4 year old (we can eat a lot too). Too bad we didn't know, so we each ordered our own. Coffee was good too."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant since I was a little kid - the best breakfast in town, hands down! The service is great (the Stepford-esque waitress thing is a bit odd, but whatever) and the food is always fresh and consistent. This place is packed on the weekends, so be prepared to wait. The best time to go is early on a Sunday morning before the church crowd arrives.

Try: Everything! My favorite is the Eggs Benedict, but the pancakes also rock."}
{"text":"I eat here frequently.  That being said, don't be in a hurry here, even if they're not busy.  When I arrived, the young man (not the owner) at the desk was not at the desk. I waited 4-5 minutes for him to return & seat me.  I almost left.  It then took a while for the waitress to arrive.  I ordered everything immediately.  Took another \"while\" for the coffee to arrive & after a longer wait, breakfast was delivered.  

I ate quickly and left because food had taken so long, & they weren't busy at all!

Final note - their coffee is SO WEAK!  I'll never understand why restaurants that serve breakfast have watered-down coffee vs rich, full-bodied coffee."}
{"text":"I like Eggington's but I'm not in love. The bacon is fantastic and the primary reason I hit up Egginton's from time to time, it's close to work and I can order it to go. The reason I'm leaving a three star rating is my eggs are never anything more than okay. The last time I ordered they were even kind of watery. Perhaps it's because I've never sat down at Eggington's but I feel like their eggs leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS OUT OF THIS WORLD AMAZING!!!

I don't know how anyone could give this place less than 5 stars.. i would give them 10 out of 5 stars if i could.  This place has THE BEST hollandaise sauce i have ever tasted.. i think i could eat buckets of it at a time.  I am so lucky i only come to this place once in a while when I'm visiting my mom (I live in Cali), otherwise I would be 500 pounds overweight from going there every day.  Last time i was home, I went there two days in a row and almost a third day as well.  

The service is great.. family owned and every one is super sweet and helpful.  Yes, it can get crowded (as it should!) and there might be a bit of a wait during peak times, but they give you free coffee while you wait!  Also, the wait is never that long.  I don't understand people who can't comprehend that when a place is this good, it's bound to be crowded and popular.

And c'mon.. the price!?  the price is SO reasonable!  I guess I can't be objective when I live in Cali and not AZ, but for the quality and quantity of food you get, I think the price is ridiculously reasonable.  

Man, I am really bummed now that I have to settle for some sub-par place in my neighborhood for breakfast this morning.  All I want is a TC Eggington's omelet \"locked in their hollandaise\"!!!  YUM!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and food. I will be returning to try the Saturday biscuit and gravy special."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast restaurants! They carry the best bran muffin I've ever had....it has a delicious brown sugar topping on it. I love coming here on special occasions!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast! Excellent food that's reasonably priced. Try the, \"crack O' dawn\"! 3 delicious fried eggs over amazing potatoes, served with an English muffin and apple cinnamon jam on the side.. Beats iHop, Denny's, and the Waffle House any day! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I went here after Pat Tillman run amazingly great breakfast warm bran muffins to die for sante Fe scramble delicious everything was fresh a must for breakfast/lunch if you're in this area."}
{"text":"So yummy I'm not really a eating out breakfast person but this was fantastic. I had the  pastry with crab and artichoke. I got the hollandaise sauce on the side because I want sure I'd like it but that was delicious as well."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Worst breakfast ever. Can't believe how many people think this place is great. Ugh."}
{"text":"I've always had a hard time deciding between eggs Benedict and an omelet.... Well this place has is figured out. By far the best breakfast place I've been to in Arizona. I just moved here from Abq but this place beats any place there as well. I cannot wait to eat here again. Excellent excellent food. Thank you for giving me a place to spend my money on amazing food."}
{"text":"Been here 2 times already for breakfast and this is by far my favorite place to come. Homemade waffles are the best I've ever had in Phoenix. Their homemade apple cinnamon jelly is perfect! Great service and very friendly people. Will always keep coming back here. Only complaint is that it is on the expensive side for me but food is amaZing."}
{"text":"Really like this place for brunch!  They have AMAZING pancakes (called Girdle cakes) - they're not too sweet, they're super fluffy, and they kind of have a bit of a sourdough taste to them.  Delicious!  Also really love their English muffins with 'Parlour Preserves' - they're own kind of jelly.   I usually get the same omelette - three chees with mushrooms - and the one thing that bothers me is that it's a different size every time.  Not a lot of quality control there.  That being said, we've gone many times and never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for at least 20 years (since I was a little girl!) and even though I now live an hour away, I still drive there for breakfast! Their French toast is the best in the valley (and trust me I have tried at least 20 other breakfast joints). I also love their huevos con chorizo and their eggs Benedict! It really doesn't get any better then this place! As for the wait, yea there always is one BUT, they take reservations over the phone so the wait is nothing if you call ahead."}
{"text":"Want an awesome breakfast/brunch experience? Come here! I love this place! I've been here several times and it's been consistently good.. Charming atmosphere and impeccable service. I will be back many more times.."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I've been going to for years and am just now getting around to sending them some long-overdue Yelp! love. T.C. Eggington's is a great family-owned half-day cafe. Tom and Kathy started this place so that they would both be able to be home when their kids got out of school. They started with a commitment to serving up freshly made and delicious food in a comfortable, bustling (but not hurried) environment. They've been doing exactly that for about 20 years now (and I think the kids have finished college). Clearly, they have the right formula and they're smart enough to not tinker with perfection.

As for the menu, bring a BIG appetite. My favorites are the O'Pear omelet (bosc pear slices with bacon, havarti cheese and almonds) and the signature Eggington omelet (chicken, mushroom, cream cheese and broccoli smothered in Hollandaise....yummmmmm). I'm a sucker for their potatoes, too. The pancakes are like fluffy giat pillows of deliciousness. For the best of both worlds, substitute a pancake for the English muffin with your omelet. 

If you're perusing the lunch menu, consider the albacore tuna, apple, walnut salad - crisp, fresh and filling. The Natie Bomb and the grilled chicken feta sandwiches also are high on my list of favs. 

Of course, if you don't want to power down 1200-2500 calories in one meal, you can get half orders or take a friend and share a meal. The smoothies and fresh baked muffins also are great lighter alternatives. 

If you have family in from out of town, it's a great breakfast/brunch option. And, it's very kid friendly. 

Tip: Ceci G. is right! It's a good idea to make a reservation ahead of time especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"There are no words. I have never in my life had a dining experience quite this terrible. It began being seated in a table where we were shoved in the corner and another table couldn't get up because we were seated there, so we had to stand up every few minutes. Then the server trying to rush our order, then she disappeared. When we finally ordered we asked for coffee and for our soup our first. She forgot the coffee, then the soup, when she brought the soup she told us the food would be right behind it. 20 minutes and four times later, the food still had not arrived. When it did arrive, my sandwich was on the wrong bread. So I had to wait even longer to eat. Then, a busser who was clearly angry that there were screaming children (which was also ridiculously annoying) started SLAMMING coffee mugs onto a tray and glaring at the table with children which continued for 5 minutes. Meanwhile we waited, and waited, and waited for our food and our checks. An hour and a half of our life has been wasted. I can't even."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to TC's for many many years!  Whenever I think of TC's I think of their eggs benedict.  Whenever I crave a eggs benedict, I think of TC's, its always been amazing, and my favorite.  Also their crab stuffed pastry benedict."}
{"text":"Fantastic! We've been going to this restaurant for over 15 years because they have an exquisite Cottage Reef with rich hollandaise sauce. Try it! Of course the prices keep going up so usually we share."}
{"text":"They know how to do eggs. Aside from the ugly outfits the woman servers have to wear, it was a good breakfast. Our server was awesome and even though it was crazy busy, he made sure we had everything."}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time with my son. I like the atmosphere it's a nice difference from IHOP and Denny's. The food was beyond comparison. I don't remember the name of the dish I ordered but it was impeccable! A pastry shell held imitation crab, artichoke hearts and was covered by a sunny side up egg. It was different and I'm glad I chose it as I was kind of hesitant to try it. They're orange juice really is made fresh I could totally taste the difference. It's a bit more than the usual breakfast franchise but the servings are huge and definitely worth it taste wise."}
{"text":"I'm from California and I HAVE to come to Eggington's when I'm in AZ. Their eggs Benedict is the very best I've ever had. The staff is always friendly and look adorable in their loafers and socks:)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for MANY years... Hands down the best food and service CONSISTENTLY... The owner is there all the time and most often everything thing runs like a well oiled machine.. I relocated to San Diego(even though we spend a lot of time in AZ) and have yet to find a TC Eggingtons replacement. Keep up the GREAT WORK..."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you this place is AWESOME for lunch... Customer service 5 star, Food 5 star, Cleanliness 5 star.... I am normally hard on places. I have worked in the industry before and have an expectation of what I believe should be a great experience at a bar/ restaurant. My wife and I arrived at 12pm for lunch. We were greeted with a smile from a clean, well dressed waitress. We were walked to our table in the middle of the restaurant, the table was already set, and needed nothing. It had a carafe of water already on the table. I ordered an ice tea, which also came in a carafe. This was awesome because I always run out of drinks and hate waiting for the waitress to refill. 

I had a ruben sandwich and a bowl of soup. The soup was one of two soups of the day and was recommended from our smiling waitress. The waitress asked all the right questions regarding our order and we began our short wait. Soup came out 5/5. It was one of the best bowls i ever had. It was a chicken in cream sauce. I unfortunately do not remember the name. My sandwich was filled with lean pastrami, fresh sour kraut, and had a melted cheese. De-lish. 

The check was brought after we finished, and was picked up quickly. Little pricey but keep in mind I did order the bowl instead of the cup and I got a whole sandwich, not a half. Well worth the money. Cost with 20% tip was still under 17 dollars. 
Total time for lunch was 40 minutes. This gave us enough time to make it back to work with a few minutes to spare. I will defintely be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant no longer welcomes people.  Good food still and wait staff are great but whoever the new manager is is just plain surly, if I was a first timer I wouldn't return to this place because of his attitude.  This morning we walked in and he didn't even speak just stared waiting for us to speak.  Then pointed to the hostess that we were here."}
{"text":"Great food! Loved the bottomless mimosas for brunch. My husband loved the bloody Mary. However, really small portions for what you pay"}
{"text":"The restaurant was tucked away in the back of the shopping center, so I missed it and had to make a U-turn. Once I found it though, I liked it. It was a really pleasant atmosphere. The staff was dressed pretty professionally.

The decor was nice, not too tacky like some restaurants can be. The food was good too. Good variety.

I liked how my subtotal with tax ended up being $9.99 (almost an even $10). That was a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I visited T.C. Eggington's for the first time this morning and were pleasantly surprised given our recent poor breakfast diner search experiences. 

Service was quick but sparse, food was delivered quickly and was delicious. Diner-type atmosphere was to be expected and staff was personable. 

Will likely return."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a kid, always pleased with the food and service! I always get the Spicy Spain omelette with toast and strawberry jam. YUM!!"}
{"text":"Whatever good things you've heard about this place, it's true. I thought they only made   great hearty breakfasts in New Jersey, but this restaurant proved me to be entirely wrong.

When we approached the building, I thought it's a pretty modest looking place, and it is, but with an incredibly welcoming staff, a large, diverse menu, and a quaint homey atmosphere, you can bet on enjoying yourself here from start to finish. I'm an omelette girl, so I went for it, and couldn't finish half of what they put on my plate. The coffee was decent, but if you're smarter than me you'll try a latte or some other fun drink they've got available."}
{"text":"What can I say? We have been coming to T. C. Eggington's for more than 10 years and are still as pleased today as that very first time.

A brunchery, T.C. Eggington's fare is consistantly high quality, tasty and filling. I believe they serve the finest hot cakes to be found anywhere as well as excellent omelets and wonderful salads and sandwiches. Combined with friendly service (a major component in a happy dining experience) and a relaxed atmosphere.

I cannot recommend T. C. Eggingtons highly enough. Please take the time for a nice leisurely visit. Be prepared though, they have such a strong following that there is frequently a wait to be seated even on weekdays, but your patience will be rewarded. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I am a huge \"foodie\", from a long line of \"foodies\". I grew up living in hotels and on room service and fine dining. This is the best, very best, breakfast restaurant EVER! I have been living in Tempe for about six years now, the first two sad sad years I did not know that this wonderful place existed...after my first visit, this is my go-to, best place to recommend, favorite breakfast place to eat at! If you go on a Sunday, it will be very very busy. Everyone is super friendly. The place is very clean. Prices are amazing! Cheaper or as cheap as the nasty breakfast places or fast food. Huge portions and great quality food. I have never had a bad experience here, and to be honest...even if I did, I wouldn't care. I feel like home here. Everything on the menu is delicious! I've tried almost everything. Here are a few of my favorites (don't forget though, I love it all) :
O'Pear Grenache Omelette, Greek Fetash Omelette, English Harvest Omelette, Huevos Con Chorizo (with scrambled eggs), and the Blueberry Hill Girdle Cakes (pancakes! you can order half an order or little ones...we always get an order to share at the table). Their potatoes are delicious and crispy, the english muffins are great and their homemade jam is absolutely amazing! I have bought many jars of their jam to give as gifts! Just delicious! I wish everyone knew about this well kept secret. DON'T LISTEN TO ANY REVIEW UNDER A 5 STAR! This place is the best, bottom line. Try it. You will be hooked."}
{"text":"Do NOT come here if you are wanting mimosas, after the first mimosa if you seem even a TINY but buzzed they will cut you off !!! Even if you prove to them you are taking an uber or lyft. Go to hulas modern tiki for bottomless mimosas on the weekend :)"}
{"text":"Great selection of home made breakfast combinations. Enjoy trying new dishes knowing I will add to my new list of favorites. We make sure to plan a day trip to include a meal."}
{"text":"My fav Breakfast place! We try to go here when we want a good omelet for breakfast! They have several different ones. It's large serving and the french toast is so delicious! It's a bit pricey for breakfast but you get what you pay for. Food is always fresh and the service is great. We have never had an issue and they take reservations. We do large parties of 20...then the service is a bit slow but it's expected  when we have large parties. I love the Pear Omelet!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots! Lots of delicious options on their menu. Their crab entrees, the cottage reef omelette and the crab stuffed pastry, are my favorites. My husband loves their French toast. Service is always great and fast."}
{"text":"This review went from a 5 to a 2. I was also told to wait a few days before I write this review. Well, it's been 2 1/2 days since we ate at TC. I used to love this place. 

Service: Servers are great. Friendly and look very presentable. The call-in wait-list works great when you do not want to wait too long. 

Food: It used to be delicious and for some reason (Sunday) must have been an off day. I got the Eggs Benedict. It was really dry and the eggs were not runny. The English muffin was crunchy. The potatoes were hard. My husband got the french toast. I doubt you can go wrong with that. Tasted good. We ordered the eggs meal with oranges and toast for my little guy. Who is less than a year old. The oranges looked like they sat there for days and weren't that tasty. 

The reason for the 2 stars: I was beside myself when I walked into the bathroom and they did not have a changing table. As a new mom and a baby with a poopy accident, I didn't have much of an option but to try and figure out what I can do. The bench in the bathroom wasn't doable. My son kept trying to roll over. I had to change him in the handicap bathroom stall on the floor :( gross!!! 

I was surprised to see such a family restaurant to not have changing tables. It doesn't encourage me to take my son anywhere and it shouldn't be like that. 

T.C Eggington's get a changing table!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast ambiance. Awesome service by Kathy who served us. The food was good but nothing mind blowing, but we would defiantly consider coming back to give it another try with other dishes. 

Great family place- feels like home."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to update this for awhile, just hadn't gotten around to it.  I cannot, in good faith, leave my rating of Eggington's with 1 star.  This is my go-to, staple, home-grown, proud-to-be-a-native-Phoenician breakfast place.  I've never brought anyone here that didn't have wonderful things to say about it, and the food is absolutely wonderful.  The same owners, recipes are constant and haven't changed on the quality of ingredients.  I don't know what I shall do if they ever close...

The Egginton Omlette is probably my favorite, but with a pancake on the side.  Followed by their eggs benedict.  Lunch isn't bad either!  But go for the breakfast."}
{"text":"They are the best. The eggington omelet, the Santa fe sauté are our favorites. Mimosas and good coffee. The service is outstanding with incredible attention to detail. No wonder they've been a landmark in this area for so long. You HAVE TO COME HERE!!!! Oh wait, that will just make the line longer than it already is... uh... it's terrible, stay away. ;)"}
{"text":"We had the English French toast and a meat omelette, both of which were absolutely amazing and delicious. Place is clean and nice. Staff is friendly and on top of things. Definitely out go to breakfast spot.."}
{"text":"This is a \"good as it gets\" place for me.  i have been going to here since it opened - telling you something about my age and that I tend to like the place.  It is a haunt of faculty and staff and even administrators from Mesa Community College.  A good place to leisurely have conversation over great food.  I am an Eggington Omelette addict so enough said."}
{"text":"Service was great, the English muffins are amazing  and the fresh juice was good (definitely fresh), but the rest of her food was pretty disappointing.  Their \"crab\" pastry is imitation meat, but not listed as such in the menu, and he way it's written on the menu is misleading.  Egg Benedict was mediocre, ham was gristley and fatty.  It was a pretty big let down, wouldn't recommend, especially with the weekend wait time to get in."}
{"text":"Delicious! I came here with a few friends because we were told it was a great place for breakfast, and that it was! I enjoyed a chorizo and egg plate that came with potatoes, cheese, and salsa. It also came with a tortilla on the side. Definitely not something that's healthy, but it sure was tasty! My friends all had different plates but we all enjoyed our breakfast. The servers are friendly and attentive and I don't think I could have really asked for much more. Yummy food and good service.

In fact, so good that we ended up coming back before our weekend trip to Arizona was over! :)"}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Restaurant set up is smooth and flowing well even when packed!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was good, but not as good as I remember in years past. Bran muffin was ho-hum; yogurt parfait was good but could've had more yogurt and less granola. My husband's Eggs Benedict were good, but not the best he's ever had."}
{"text":"I've been going here most of my life and it will forever be my favorite place for breakfast. Every menu item is delicious and the staff is consistently pleasant, quick, and correct! The owners are kind and remember their regulars. There's a reason this restaurant has been around for so long...don't skip out on this gem! It's an east valley essential! 

My favorites: passion fruit tea, the greek fetash (reduced portion...2 eggs instead of 3?), their homemade jam on the English muffins or a honey bran muffin in place of the English muffin!"}
{"text":"This place personifies good customer service!  
This particular TC Eggington's on Alma School Road is very good.  Occasionally I will visit for breakfast - sometimes with my wife and the food and service has always been excellent.  I particularly appreciate their willingness to accommodate our dietary requirements.  Never have they failed to be attentive and helpful, friendly and seat their customers quickly.  

I wanted to write this review because just recently there was a mistake made in our order.   It was Black Friday and they were I think, a bit understaffed and busier than expected - which I believe contributed to the error.  The food for my wife and I was taking an unusually long time to get out to us and when it did - both our plates of food was stone cold.  Yes, really!  Cold eggs, yuck!  Someone dropped the ball and forgot our order.  Anyway, we immediately told the next server we saw that the food was unacceptable because it was cold.  We were not mad... just disappointed.  They seemed skeptical but remained polite and professional and apologetic.   They took our plates and said they would take care of it.  A minute or two later the Manager comes to our table and is falling all over himself apologizing for the screw-up and wait... admitting the food was indeed very cold and he was going to have all the food remade (not just heated) and was rushing it for us.  We did not want any discount but he insisted on discounting the order by half!  The food came shortly and was absolutely delicious as is the norm in this place.  The only reason for not giving it five stars is because they do not accept AARP discounts.

My whole point in telling this story is that mistakes happen.... but it is how it is handled afterward that very often reveals the true character of a person and/or establishment.  We were more surprised than annoyed precisely because it was so unusual.  Their efforts to make everything right is so commendable - especially in our culture today where professionalism is claimed but seldom delivered.  

I ask that you give these folks at TC Eggington's at Alma School Rd a try.  You will have a delicious meal served with a smile every time."}
{"text":"So good! Cute little breakfast/brunch spot right off the 60. A huge array of breakfast items of every sort and lunch items like sandwiches as well. The decor inside is very farmhouse chic. Lots of indoor and outdoor seating. Food was awesome!"}
{"text":"WOW!! Food was fantastic. I had the Eggington Omelet with avocado. It was outstanding. My wife had the apple pancakes and loved them. The price was very reasonable. We will definitely make this a regular."}
{"text":"Went here twice last month with family. My husband suffers from multiple food allergies and the waitress was supper helpful on our selections and more then willing to check with the chef. The food was excellent, service was great even though they were always busy. I would go again and again and again, Awesome!"}
{"text":"First time trying out this place and I love it! Great atmosphere and service. Friendly waitress and delicious omelette  I'll bring my family here but seeing how popular it is I'll make sure to call in a reservation."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a very small child, and I can confidently say this is the best breakfast restaurant in the Phoenix area! Great atmosphere, great service (usually), amazing food! My hubby loves the English toast with a French flair, and I love the cottage reef omelette. I used to eat here every Sunday before church, there's usually a wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"Uh...the reviews were so on point about this place.  I love the decor.  A bit old school with that exclusive country club feel.  The music was nostalgic: reminded me of growing up listening to my mom's favorite station Lite FM in NY (a mix of 70s and 80s lite pop).  Everything was delicious, can't wait to go back.  The omelettes and French toast are indeed wonderful...wow."}
{"text":"Honestly, I really wanted to love this place just bc the staff here were super friendly and accommodating to us upon arrival to the moment we walked out. It's a cute homey environment and the waiters/waitresses wear polo shirts + khakis which reminded me of what the saved by the bell folks wore during the episodes of when they worked at the summer beach house lol.

Anyway, so to the food. I ordered the simple breakfast which consisted of eggs, breakfast potatoes, sausage links, and English muffins. The eggs were pretty much drenched in oil and everything else was just mehh. I must say though, the apple cinnamon jam they have sitting on the table was bomb! The French toast was dry and also nothing to brag about.

Oh and I also got a peach billini which came w a peach gummy ring at the bottom of it. Def my first time seeing that and I'm not sure if I like the whole concept of it.

I gave them an extra star for the great service, though."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for breakfast.  Okay, well, let me clarify.  This is our ONLY go-to place for breakfast.  We go here on lazy Saturday mornings.  We take guests here.  We recommend it to anyone who'll listen.

Their food is consistenly good (due to my gluten issues, I normally get the Plain and Simple with eggs and sausage and sub tomatoes for the english muffin).  My husband usually gets some sort of omelette or scramble and subs a pancake for his english muffin.  

The waitstaff is never less than happy to be there (or at least it sure seems that way!).  I've never had someone in a bad mood, I've never had anyone be snippy with my questions about ingredients, no one's ever looked askance at me for my weird food issues.  

Only one small thing that irks me, and I plan on talking to someone about it, but just haven't gotten around to it.  I'm a tea snob, see?  And I think that their hot water for tea isn't much in the way of filtered.  I remember when we first moved to Phoenix and didn't realize the water was so horrible.  I woke up and made myself some tea.  It took a little bit of time, but I realized a few things - it's the wrong color, there is some sort of film on top, and this crap leaves _rings_ on the side of the mug.  Holy hard water, batman!  Let me tell you, what a difference a filter makes.  Okay, filtered water.  We quickly learned that a Brita filter or a Pur-that-attaches-to-your-sink-faucet filter just don't cut it here.  So, we get Sparkletts.  It makes SUCH a huge difference.  So, I know that tea drinkers probably don't comprise a large constituency for them, and my comments may fall on slightly deaf ears, but hey, a girl's gotta try, right?  Some day, at least. ;)

A few words to the wise.  They have apple cinnamon jelly on the table, but if that's not to your taste, they also have blackberry (I think) jam availalble.

Second sneaky secret - to beat the rush on the weekends?  Call in advance and get your name on the list before you leave the house.  Works like a dream."}
{"text":"We enjoyed eating a late morning breakfast on the patio this morning.  The tables and chairs are definitely showing wear, but it was so pleasant dining outside.  The server brought a pitcher of iced water and a carafe of coffee promptly and I enjoyed being able to fill my coffee myself rather than wait for a server.  The omelette with pear, havarti, and bacon was delicious.  The accompanying potatoes took up half of the plate and they were fine, but nothing special.  I added a lot of green Cholula sauce to give them some flavor.  The homemade cinnamon jam was very good atop the toasted English muffin.  My husband wanted something spicy, so on the suggestion of the server, he ordered the Hot Mama frittata.  He enjoyed it, but said it was not especially spicy.  He, too, thought the potaotes were boring.  The server was friendly and efficient, and we enjoyed our experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great breakfast which is reasonably priced. A menu with many choices and a good variety plus old favorites. My meal was delicious."}
{"text":"Best breakfast, consistent for the past 15 years I have eaten there...and today I ventured to the lunch menu. Holy sandwich Batman! Turkey. Bacon. Cheddar. Apple. Caramelized Onions. Sun-dried Tomatoes. Do it!"}
{"text":"It was alright. Had a mimosa and the Eggington Omelette. The chicken in the omelette was dry and underseasoned, along with huge piece and of broccoli instead of being chopped up. But the apple cinnamon jam on the English muffin was definitely the best thing there."}
{"text":"Ahhh freshly squeezed orange juice, yum.  I am a fan of their eggs benedict (without the ham) and roasted potatoes, very good.  The staff is friendly and helpful and the food is delicious and tastes just like home made cookin'! Just forget about going there on Sat or Sun morning unless you enjoy waiting and waiting and waiting some more. I suggest going on a weekday, you get seated right away. Great place to take the family for breakfast."}
{"text":"The best place for breakfast that I have ever eaten at! The eggs Benedict are way above any place in town."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant, delicious meal at this venue! The \"Dickens\" pita with chicken is no longer on the menu; however, it is made on request and sooo tasty!"}
{"text":"Country Club Atmosphere
Quick Friendly Service
Consistently good Eggs Benny
If you're paying cash make sure you mention you want change because the waitresses will think you intentionally meant to give a $18 tip on a $25 meal for two."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place right before leaving town and I'm so happy I did. The food was delicious and the customer service was phenomenal. Shoutout to my groups server: Diana (sweetest little thing)! 
I thought I was dining in a Disneyland establishment, that's how comforting and cheerful the atmosphere is. Management is top-notch with some of the most GENUINELY friendly people I've seen in a long time. I'll have to come by again next time I'm in town. 10 stars and 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. We were told it was a 30 min wait. Only had a wait 20. They had a cold water station and misters while waiting in 115 degree heat. Those two things made it bearable. Had the southeast omelette which was YUMMY! Also had the pear/cheese/almond/bacon omelette. It was ok. Wouldn't order again but that's just me. Others may like the combo. Their English muffins paired with cinnamon apple butter is TO DIE FOR. I could just have those two things and be very happy."}
{"text":"Great gluten free options

This is definitely a quality breakfast and lunch restaurant. I have to eat gluten free and they offer enough options, but I usually get the eggs, ham steak, hash browns (delicious and just a little crispy) and upgrade to a gluten free pancake. It is hands down the best gluten free pancake I've had at home or out. So flavorful and moist. My husband has had their regular pancakes, but actually prefers the gluten free pancake. The coffee is good as well, just a little on the weak side.
The service is consistently good and the restaurant has a nice just slightly country atmosphere. When the weather is nice they do have a small outdoor patio. Breakfast is an average of $12.00 plus tip with coffee, but well worth it!
I would definitely recommend it and will return."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?!?!? This place is always amazing and never lacks in any area of hospitality, food or customer service! Be prepared to wait because there's always one and it is always worth it! They always have water, tea and coffee outside for guests and some seating so it makes the time pass a little easier. 

The menu is extensive and there is truly something for everyone. The hardest part is trying new things every time I come because the last dish was so amazing! The servers uniforms are so cute, makes me feel like I'm in Kentucky for some odd strange reason. The Khakis with the light colored shirts they always look so crisp and clean!

The older gentleman that's always in he FOH (I believe he is the owner but not quite sure) is always patient and accommodating (as is the staff)! 

For the professional bruncher: they have mimosas, bloody Mary's, bellini's and screw drivers- all for $5! You can't beat it! 

They also have lunch- I've never had lunch here but I'm sure it's great! Why have lunch when you can have all this breakfast/brunch! 

I take everyone here and have yet to have any complaints..... In fact TC's quickly becomes one of their favs as well!"}
{"text":"We went here for first time just a few days ago because someone recommended it.  I liked the atmosphere when we walked in door.  They had pitchers of water on the tables with lemon slices and ice which was a nice change especially in AZ.  I love my water and lemon.  Ordered the special which was the quiche with spinach, bacon, and avocado.  I have never in my life had a bad quiche not even a frozen one.  This one was really bad.  It took me two hands and lots of force on my fork to cut through the bottom of the crust.  It was obviously old and had been in refrigerator and then microwaved.  You could taste the refrigeration and it was cold warm cold warm all throughout.  Potatoes were ok you cant really mess that up but no spices or anything just nothing special.  Ordered French toast instead cuz lady that gave recommendation said that was her favorite.  Yuck.  Wasnt cooked all the way through soggy in the middle and came with a big scoop of bad tasting margarine on top.  The bread was huge and it was meant to be special I could tell but it just didnt taste special.  It didnt even taste regular let alone special.  Had a funny taste that I am not sure I can describe.  The service was very good but the food was just no good.  This company also owns Ncounter in Tempe and I see they are also getting bad reviews."}
{"text":"We were looking for a brunch spot after church Sunday and of course, thanks to the great # of reviews via Yelp... my brother, hubby and I headed to TC Eggington's. There was a line but the wait was about 15 minutes. 

The menu includes a variety of omelets, french toast, pancakes, sandwiches and pitas. They offer fresh juice and the waiter said their current special was a pumpkin latte. I normally would have ordered a latte but I already had my coffee fix so I passed. 

I ordered a vegetable omelet, my brother ordered a pita sandwich and my hubs ordered blueberry pancakes. The pancakes were HUGE! My omelet was substituted with egg whites and mixed with fresh veggies. They also have 3 different jam options on the table. (It's not freshly made jam though)

The bathrooms are interesting. The woman's is completely separated from the men's room. And they even have an old-fashioned phone in the middle for customers to use. (Although most people I assume have a cell phone now)

Service was great no complaints."}
{"text":"Had to wait a bit, probably about 30 min, but we were hungry so we stuck with it. We sat outside in the patio, it was a bit hot, but we didn't want to wait another 10-15 min to eat. I ordered French toast and it was Ok, I'd say a 3.5/5. It didn't come with anything, just the French toast with bananas on top. The bananas weren't quite ripe yet, so not as sweet as I'd like. Overall the food was nothing special, but not bad. 

The coffee pot they leave on the table to self serve was horrible, the lid got stuck and burned my hand badly. It was not fun. We let the waitress know and she brought me a bag of ice which I appreciated. She also commented that the lids to get stuck sometimes (which tells me they know about the problem). 

We didn't make a huge deal out of it but my hand was badly burned, I was in tears in the bathroom letting cold water run over it, super painful. A manager never came over to us or anything, and we paid for my breakfast. Seems kind of crappy considering. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Visited 5/30/12...

This is a gem that is tucked away at the Southwest corner of Alma School and 60.  In the same parking lot as Chicago Pizza.  

Went for a brunch.  Figured it would have cleared out but Noon.  Nope.  Still line to get in. 

Had a skillet menu with a pancake.  Everthing tasted great.  Pancake was huge. 

Not sure why I have not been here before??  But will definately return."}
{"text":"Im not sure of we went on an off day but the service was slow. The food was mediocre at best. I ordered the crab pastry with hollandaise. It was imitation and the hollandaise was obviously a powder. I could taste the butter flavored margarine on the potatoes. we will.not be going back. $30 for two people plus tip. Such a waste. Also the tables and high chairs were gross I had to wipe them down."}
{"text":"TC's was the most humbling dining experience I have had in Phoenix. I mean really, the strip-mall it calls home is both unassuming and weird. But, TC's was FANTASTIC! Everything was PERFECT! While my food was delicious- our service was the best I've had in years. Really- I don't know if it is because our waitress was so chill (and professional) or that all the wait staff was trained this well...? But they are doing something right! 

I hope that your dining experience is just as wonderful as mine was!"}
{"text":"My Father in Law always says that going to TC Eggington's is like being on vacation, and he is so right!

It is a bright, sunny restaurant with a little bit of outdoor seating, however I always prefer to sit inside for either the airconditioning or heat, depending on the time of year. The decor in the restaurant is preppy-country, with chicken wire accents (ie. in the menu covers), Country-style tables and chairs, llight colors, lots of windows, and flowers on each table. 

The servers are typically very good - they tend to be young, clean cut, and well spoken. They all dress in pastel polo shirts, khaki shorts, and loafers, which lends to the resort/Country Club feel of the place. There is an older gentleman who is usually at the front desk; I believe he is the manager or owner. He is often friendly but has also been a bit rude on occasion - try to let this slide if you can as the rest of the restaurant is so worth it! 

The food is great - I really haven't anything that I did not like, although there are definitely some favorites! My favorite dish at TC's is the Au Pear Grenache Omelet - a delicious omelet filled and topped with bacon, almonds, fresh slices of pear, and gruyere cheese. It is a nice savory omelet with a hint of sweetness from the pears. The crunch of the almonds keeps it interesting and it is SO GOOD. It is served with breakfast potatoes (a nice complement to the texture of the omelet) and a house-made English muffin. The English Muffin is a great way to finish - they have yummy apple-cinnamon preserves on every table. 

My husband's favorite dish is a lunch item: the Natie Bomb Sandwich. It is a turkey sandwich served on 12 grain bread with bacon, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and APPLE (yum!) with a sundried tomato sauce. It usually comes with a cold pasta salad, but I recommend going with an alternate side as the pasta salad isn't all that great. 

The pancakes, fritatta, etc are all delicious as well! I highly recommend TC Eggingtons for a nice, vacationy breakfast.

OH! And the best thing: They take reservations. They are usually super busy for brunch on the weekends and you can wait 30 minutes + for a table, but if you know you want to dine with them ahead of time, make a reservation and everything is so much easier. I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes whenever I make a reservation ahead of time."}
{"text":"Our friends are huge fans of this place so they took us after a morning hike.  Everything we had was delicious!  The pear omelet, the Piglet Passion omelet (bacon, ham and sausage), Apple Jack (pancake with apples, pecans and brown sugar cinnamon) and the french toast.  We sat outside which was nice with the misters.  The inside looked very nice and warming, they even had fresh daisies in vases on the tables.   Two things keeping us from going here more often - it's not close to where we live, and the price.  I think $27 for 2 people for breakfast is a little pricey but we'll keep it in mind for when visitors come to town or special occasions.  Safe to say you won't be disappointed if you go here.

{"text":"Love this place and I am not a breakfast person. The french toast (they call it english toast with a french flair) is the best I have ever had. They are always really busy so expect a short wait. The atmosphere is fun and I have always had really good service. Unique items on the menu including an eggs benedict with crab meat and artichokes which was soooo good!"}
{"text":"Came here with bf and his mom. The owner came up and greeted us, so friendly! sat us and gave us a heads up that our waiter was a newb working with another waitress. It was a Friday so I was excited to order  clam chowder. But it was time for a brunch and I wanted breakfast too! I was ordering Girdle stacks (Strawberry something) omg that thing was HUGEEEE. I also ordered a clam chowder (don't judge, I wanted both!) Boyfriend got the Egg Benedict (OMG THAT WAS BEYOND AMAZING). they forgot my clam chowder, but honestly their stacks were so huge I couldn't even finish. And the syrup came hot! Which is a huge plus. 

Took off a star for a couple of reasons. One. My bf's mom meal was suppose to come with a toast/biscuit/muffin, she had to ask...he forgot. Then not only did the waiter forget my clam chowder (which I was thankful, because I was way too full,) but they charged us for it :("}
{"text":"just ate here for the first and last time. the breakfast we had was the worst i've had in a long time. i got the farmers egg benedict. was floating in hollandaise which made the eng. muffin soggy. the potatoes tasted like they might have been microwaved, soggy. my other half had a crabmeat and artichoke with cream cheese...ugh ugh yeah cream cheese omelet i gave it a try and was just gross.  service was good wait time was good. atmosphere was good. food was not."}
{"text":"The wait was not to long to get a table. Around 20 min. It took 15 min once we got seated for the waitresses to get around to coming by our table and get my wife's and I drink orders.
The Lattes were delicious,"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in the east valley. When we treat our family to a breakfast out, this is where we go. Plan ahead on the weekend and make a reservation or plan to wait for about an hour. Yes, it's that good and yes, it's worth it. We eat breakfast here every year for Mother's Day and it is totally packed. Despite being busy, the staff always has a smile while busting their rears to serve everyone. My favorite meal is the blueberry pancakes. Order a half-stack unless you are one of those people that can consume enough food for a contest. The muffins are also superb and the bacon is crisp and thick. I've never had an issue with the eggs that some have mentioned. Mine have always been great and not greasy or oily. Definitely order breakfast and not lunch. Although lunch is good, it's not as fabulous as the breakfast selections. Sit back, fill up and make sure the rest of your day has time for a nap."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We were in and out of there on a Saturday morning in about 30 minutes. Service was fantastic and the food was GREAT! Had the Spicy Spain omelet and the crab puff pastry Benedict.....they were stupid good! And the mimosa and bloody Mary were the icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"Great place with updated atmosphere.  Perfect for basic business breakfast meetings and unrushed table service.

Food is solid and the Eggs Benedict were perfect as were the browns.  Nothing negative at all to say here."}
{"text":"Great breakfast... we showed up with 12 people at 9am on Sunday... and was told 20 minutes. I for sure was betting that they wouldn't get us in under 45 minute... but they did - which really impressed me.

The food was good... tasty, hot, and the eggs were done correctly... not much more you can ask for from a breakfast place... we'll be back definitely!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast joint I have ever been. Orange juice is fresh hand squeezed. Food is fresh and just the right portion. You don't leave feeling like you have a food baby. Staff is friendly and nice with the owner acting as the host. Very clean and easy to find right off the the 60 and Alma School Road. If your looking for a nice breakfast place this would be it. I gave them 5 OJ's and no white Bronco on this one....."}
{"text":"My only qualm with the place is that they only serve biscuits and gravy on Saturdays, and my husband works every Sat :( but other than that, this place is always hopping and always delicious!! Whenever I have friends visit from out of town I make sure to take them here! Everything is egg-cellent!! :D"}
{"text":"I visited T.C. Eggington's for lunch today with four business associates.  We were seated immediately, and greeted by a very friendly server and one of the managers.  Our orders were taken quickly, and we were given excellent service throughout our meals.  I had some difficulty choosing an entree to order, but once I did, I was very impressed with the sandwich (named Phoenician-chicken-something I believe) and the side that came with it.

I don't believe I would've had any difficulty choosing this item if the entree names and descriptions on the menu were clearer.  I feel like I spent the first 10 minutes at the table reading long, frilly descriptions of sandwiches...delicious sandwiches, mind you."}
{"text":"Everything I have eaten here is excellent not to mention, they offer the BEST Eggs Benedict EVER MADE!  I love this family owned restaurant and have been going for years.  I especially love their new decor and light fixtures, it gives the restaurant a great country feel inside."}
{"text":"I visited T. C. Eggington's while in Arizona for a family get-together. 

My first impression was not great. We stood around by the front desk for 5 minutes while the staff tried to avoid noticing we were there. Five minutes doesn't sound like a lot, but it's an eternity while waiting around for the hostess to notice you. 

We were finally seated and had a nice, but distracted, waiter assigned to our table. 

We started with what I have come to think of as typical Arizona coffee: bland, medium-roast Folgers-style. It was my first coffee in AZ, so I was surprised at how awful it was. I've realized since then that it's just how Arizonians prefer it and drink it. 

We waited a long time for breakfast to be served. The coffee cups sat around empty for long stretches and we had to remind the waiter to refill them. 

My breakfast was mostly worth the wait. I ordered the pear omelet. The combination of mild sweetness in a perfectly cooked omelet with Havarti cheese and a dash of bacon is fall-out-of-my-chair delicious. The potatoes were cold and pale. Be sure to try the apple cinnamon preserves. Very tasty and original. Lots of breakfast places have their own salsa, but their own jam recipes? Not many! You don't want to miss this one on your English muffins. 

The restaurant was not busy, so I have no idea why the service was such a wreck and the food was rather inconsistent. We were visiting Arizona for a graduation, so it could be that some of the staff was looking forward to their own graduation that weekend, or had been out late the night before. 

I'd give TC Eggington's another chance when back in AZ."}
{"text":"Time to let others know how great this place is!  We've been coming here for 20+ years, and even though they update the decor once in a while, the service and food is always reliably wonderful.  (We would really like to steal some lights from then - very cool!)

Today was the Hot Pad (chorizo burro) for me and an egg-white omelet for the missus.  Not too noisy so you can talk to each other comfortably, they keep an eye on you and ask if you need anything regularly.  

The super diverse menu has just about anything you could want for breakfast/brunch - healthy to not-quite so much, but they are all brought out hot and tasty.

Can't beat it if you're in the neighborhood looking to start your day off right."}
{"text":"Just came here for the first time and was extremely impressed! Everything is amazing from the decor to the food. Service was fast and friendly and everything came out in a timely manner but we never felt rushed out. Food tastes so fresh and has unique flavors that other breakfast food lacks. They have set the bar high for every competitor, which I believe there is no competition. I will be coming back anytime I want to go out for breakfast. Definitely my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"I was visiting my family from San Diego and was looking for a place for Sunday brunch on Mother's Day and found this place on here. I made reservations and I am so glad I did since there was 1 1/2 hour wait! There's a reason the wait is so long......the food is frickin great!!! The place was packed but they sat us immediately (thank you for honoring your reservations). 

The menu had a lot to choose from and everyone had something different. My boyfriend and I both got the Egg's Benedict and I ordered the short stack pancakes for my 2 year old. I got a mimosa too, it was Mother's Day after all! The mimosa was fresh and light and perfect for brunch. The food took awhile to come out and my 2 year old was getting food cranky so the waitress brought him some crackers to tide him over. After he ate all of those he was still hungry! They brought him some fruit and some more crackers. We all appreciated that since a food cranky 2 year old is no fun for anyone to dine with!

When our food came out everything looked delicious! It tasted even better!! The hollandaise was so fresh and yummy, the eggs were perfectly poached and the potatoes crispy on the outside and tender on the inside! Mmmmmmmm!! My son's pancakes were perfect for him. He ate 3 of them (which for him is a lot, especially after fruit and crackers). Anyway, everyone was very pleased with their menu selections. 

When the waitress brought the check she told us they had comped our cocktails for the food delay!! What great customer service, I mean totally above and beyond! I highly recommend this place and will most definitely be back when we come back to visit. I'm already sad we don't have one in San Diego"}
{"text":"I was really excited to eat here. It was a beautiful sunny morning and the restaurant looked  very inviting. I was greeted by a warm friendly gentleman and seated quickly. My server arrived shortly thereafter and took my beverage order. It goes downhill from there. Food was spilt on the floor next to me and the young girls working there never stopped to clean it up. The server stopped to ask if I would like more juice but failed to remove the empty glass. The food arrived. The server never checked back with me. It was quite a while before I ever saw her again. When I was finished she asked if I needed a box but never removed my plates. By now I have very little table space available.  It seems to be a trend that young people are clueless as to what being a server entails. So sad. I probably won't return."}
{"text":"There's definitely a Carolinas feel when you go here. Service is very attentive, and portion sizes are on the bigger side. The hollandaise sauce here is good, but could be too oily to some. Get the crab stuffed pastry if you can. 

Hash browns are okay. It's interesting to see how different breakfast places interpret their hash browns. This place has them slightly textured on the outside, soft in the middle. For me, that's acceptable. 

Would encourage revisits. Multiple."}
{"text":"The decor was adorable! I liked the big open ambiance a lot. The food was pretty good as well. Honestly a true standard breakfast good for a couple or groups. However, there was a wait, so make sure that you aren't starving too much before you go."}
{"text":"This place is...different...but in a good way. I had an omelette, but it had sliced peaches in it. Along with bacon and almond nuts as well. And surprisingly, it was amazing!!! I honestly would recommend this place. So much, not only for the food, but the atmosphere it's self was very pleasing, and relaxing."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places ever! First time here. Drove 25 minutes from Gold Canyon based on Yelper's reviews and once again, Yelpers were right!!!

Had Eggs Benedict and the Crack of Dawn Skillet. Hollandaise was on point! I still have dreams about that skillet. Perfect in every way. What was on the side, you ask? Two English Muffins. Um. What? Why am I talking about bread? Well, the english muffins are the bomb!! Seriously. Like my boyfriend almost busted into the kitchen to fond out where they get them from. They apparently get them from a local bakery. We might become stalkers.  Then, the waitress asked us if we had tried the apple cinnamon butter on the table. No. So, then we did and then our eyes popped out. Wow. No words! Insane!! 

Update: Second time back in one week. Had the Crab Stuffed Pastry and the Eggington Omelet. Soooo good! More English Muffins and Apple Butter! Also had an awesome Screwdriver and Mimosa! Great fresh squeezed OJ! Holy moly! Now when we eat breakfast anywhere else we are mad that we didn't just go back to The Egg. (Sigh)

Update 6/1/15: I travel for a living and I won't be back to Arizona for 7 months. I'm sad. I miss this place. We have taken to comparing all breakfast places to TC Eggingtons. They don't compare. I'm 2000 miles away. (Sigh)"}
{"text":"This place is the best place in the valley for breakfast and lunch bar none. The oh pear omelette is our favorite. The only thing I don't like is they use fake crab in crab meals. Other than hat this place is perfect."}
{"text":"Delicious! My boyfriend kept telling me how great this place was so it had a lot to live up to and it came thru. I had an eggs benedicts with a twist, it had crab meat and artichokes, my fave! I have never seen anything before like this on a breakfast menu, so A+ for the creativity.  Extra + for the soy latte. Overall, great, thanks!"}
{"text":"I appreciated the unique tastes and odd breakfast pairings (asparagus, mushrooms, goat cheese, etc.) on T.C. Eggington's eclectic looking menu, but the variety offered really isn't as extensive as it first appears, service was average at best and the pricing is pretty extreme for what equates to Waffle House quality food with an extra helping of mushrooms and hollandaise sauce thrown on top. Basic entrees and orange juice for 2 individuals = $26...before tip! That's certainly an expensive way to start your day!

The atmosphere makes it a great place to take family visiting from out of town, which I plan to do, but the price makes it hard to justify as a regular breakfast stop. You can get equivalent food at other local establishments for half the price."}
{"text":"This is amongst the best breakfast place in the valley. My wife and I try to make it every month and try get  something different on the menu.  I never succeed and get the piglet passion with a side of Bacon.  Wife always gets fruit which is always fresh and a side eggs and english muffin.  We have never had a bad experience there.  I would like to suggest some flavored coffee creamer or stronger coffee"}
{"text":"Oh yes I love this place...outdoor seating and indoor, right off the 60 and has my favorite omelette ever... the European? maybe.... it had Swiss cheese, chives, bacon.  Can't wait to visit here again. Gets a little packed on weekends for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is cute, however lacking on flavor. The skillet I had was plain when I was expecting it to be bursting with flavor due to everything having a lot of peppers and spices in their menu description. The tortilla was also lacking and did not taste very authentic, more like store bought. The coffee was very weak, the OJ was decent but expensive and it tasted like Simply Orange (not necessarily a bad thing, but I was expecting something fresher). The best part of the meal was the Foster's French toast, albeit on the sweet side it was very nice of them to split it as it was being shared."}
{"text":"This is probably the best breakfast place in the east valley. Athough we are new to the area, we have dined here several times before and have always come away with high praise. All the omelets are excellent and the pumpkin pancakes are yummy.  They do take reservations so if you want to avoid the long wait... 30 minutes or more on weekends, do call ahead."}
{"text":"Meh. Perhaps eggs and potatoes were the wrong thing to get. Didn't know you could mess that up... Just not great. The English muffin was fantastic though."}
{"text":"On a weekend the host lost our name on the his scratchpad, that was supposed to be the waiting list. Empty coffee canisters while we waited 30 min. I finally asked when we would be seated. He flipped FOUR pages forward on his scratchepad and said he could seat us now. When we ordered I was appalled the crab Benedict was made with surmi  (artificial crab). It was only just warm and the meat was abundant and disgusting. I want everything about that brunch back."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, the only reason i detract a star is for ambiance. it's all down home, country themed (country as in floral curtains, not music). and it's popular with the over 50 crowd.... so, not my breakfast joint of choice on that per say, but the food is rad.

the other day i had what i can only compare to eggs benedict, except instead of an english muffin it was a puff pastry, and instead of ham there was crab meat. whoa, that was intense...delicious, but intense.

i love that when you order ice tea or water, they bring the whole carafe so you can refill at your own pace.

i can't help but feel a twang of sympathy for those poor waitresses in the golf shirts, pleated khaki shorts and loafers... it's kind of cute, but really just sort of unflattering and dorky - but not cute dorky. and my mom swears one of the waitresses had a black eye -- very off-putting when she's rocking dockers and socks with loafers..."}
{"text":"This is a very cute breakfast place in Mesa AZ in a strip mall.  Get there early on a weekend or you will be waiting. 

Nice menu but pricey.  I felt $3.50 for a very small orange juice was a bit much.  I should have paid $5 to get the mimosa.  The food was good. My blueberry pancake was enormous and came with this blueberry compote that was warm and so delicious.  They also brought a pitcher of syrup.

My server was just average.  The place was kind of loud and tables are close together too. I was sitting at a table for two and it was just me.  My two plates about filled the table since they put my eggs/fruit on one plate and the pancake on another. 

I might go back but probably not this trip."}
{"text":"I've been coming here every week for over 2 years and it's honestly one of my favorite breakfast spots in the South Tempe/Mesa area. They have amazing customer service and bomb.com breakfasts. Highly recommend the O'Pear Omelette, Chipotle Breakfast Burrito, and the Breakfast Salad (which is actually a delicious, gargantuan parfait). T.C. Eggington's does get busy on holidays, so be sure to get there before the breakfast rush!!!"}
{"text":"Solid brunch spot. First Benedict that came out was overdone but he manager promptly ordered me a new one and let me pick at the first plate in the meantime. Potatoes were good second Benedict round was money. Mimosa was pricey though not sure why. More than half the cost of a plate. Great service also!"}
{"text":"Excellent,  it's been 17 years since I have been here and always had great memories and they still are rocking the breakfast menu! Great friendly service, nice farm decor, unique omelets."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm I love breakfast and I loved my eggs Benedict. Only downside was my minuscule side dish of home fries and fruit was about 5 pieces hidden under my plate dressing of leafy veggies for decor. We called in for reservations (or to be on the wait list) and got there and was seated right away. They could do themselves a solid by expanding their space too."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here when I was visiting Phoenix as she explained this was her favorite breakfast place in the city.

The place is decorated like a country farmhouse with floral wallpaper, pictures of farmers and spoons and whisks hanging from the wall. Our servers were friendly but young. I swear everyone who worked here was 16 or younger.

I ordered an omelet that had cheese and pear and bacon. It was delicious and one of the best omelets I've ever had. I was blown away by just how sophisticated the food was for a place that seems very quaint.

I would love to come back here the next time I'm in Phoenix.

The best part was the menu that explained the weird and wonderful Eggington family. You need to go here just for the charming menu."}
{"text":"After reading the excellent reviews of T.C. Eggingtons, I saw \"The Benedict sauce is amazing\" so I had to stop. The table setting is enchanting; there is a carafe of ice cold water waiting for you, and the glassware was decorative and contained two daisies, which reminded me of the finer restaurants in Spain and France.

The waitress was sweet and extremely helpful. I loved her service and demeanor. 

I ordered the Eggs Benedict and it was very good. The sauce was as advertised: creamy, lemony, and just rich enough to make it luscious. The potatoes are slightly crispy and soft in the middle. Everything was seasoned perfectly.

So why the three star review instead of 4 or 5? I ordered the griddle cakes. They were enormous, a little battery, and looked delicious. After taking a few bites, sadly I found a hair in my food. The manager was very helpful and gracious and helped me with offering another order or removing it from my order.

Still, I would give this restaurant another shot. What I got to eat was very very good."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. This place had me smiling all the way home. Great job. Also the fresh squeezed juice is recommended. I haven't found a better option for the price. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went here to meet some friends from out of state.

I ordered the Red Hot Mama plate which consist of eggs, jalapenos, chorizo and something else( I don't remember).

I got it because I was in the mood for spicy. This one was NOT spicy. It had flavor but no \"kick\". Disappointed.

Friends from out of state didn't seem thrilled about it either.  

Also, the coffee was weak. Really weak!

This is the second time going here and left feeling unsatisfied.

At least we got to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast! The orange juice is great. Also the foster's french was awesome. Great service and overall good!"}
{"text":"So, I feel like they had some service problems with seating folks - but  I'm going to put them aside and mostly review them on the solid food here.  

Really cute country decor inside and it's a pretty large place.  We called ahead and we were told there was no wait but put our names on what we thought was a call ahead list.  At least that's what the guy on the phone told us...
So we got there and we had a few people ahead of us.  It seemed that even though we called ahead for a 10:00am table we needed to wait.  Okay, no biggie.  But then more people started coming and the one guy manning the front desk seemed to get completely overwhelmed.  We waited a little longer than we expected to wait - but were finally seated at a table in their back room.

Really wanted to try their special raspberry chocolate mocha but was told that their machine had not been functioning.  Bummer. 

The cinnamon apple jam was really delicious.  Almost bought a jar it was so good!  I would come back just for that stuff! 

I ordered the O'Pear Grenache Omelette and it was really tasty!  Enjoyed the potatos, too!  

My kiddo ordered the pancakes and we were really impressed by the very large pancake that arrived.  She very much enjoyed it, too!"}
{"text":"Giant portions of really good food. Excellent service. The french toast was so good I dreamt about it afterwards!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday afternoon and had the \"Natie Bomb\".  This was THE BEST sandwich I have ever had!  My wife had pancakes; which were absolutely amazing, as well.  I almost ordered another one to go.  If you plan on going on a weekend morning, you're going to be waiting for about 45 minutes.  It's the best breakfast in town!
I just wish I could give this place 6 stars..."}
{"text":"Ok... Breakfast is my thing. I don't like frills and weird stuff. I ordered something they call \"Plain and Simple\". Easy enough... Eggs, bacon and potatoes. I guess I confused them, I ordered an extra egg. I asked for the three eggs \"over medium\". Which the world over means the whites done and the yolks not. These were cooked over hard (hard whites and yokes). That wasn't all... The potatoes were cottage style and they put Lawry's seasoning on them. Sorry, I won't be back"}
{"text":"It's always busy. The food is fabulous. I find I eat slower and enjoy the time when there. I like the choices and capabilities to work with my diet. I've taken many friend's here and we'll continue. It's one of my top fav breakfast restaurants."}
{"text":"Called on a Sunday morning and they were able to hold a table for our large group.  Server was so quick & efficient !! Food was great. Large portions so plan to take home leftovers.  Ordered the cottage omelet. Delicious !!! Loved that there was Sooo much crab in the omelet. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I went here on a Sunday morning hung over from Four Lokos. 

The food was fucking great and I don't even like breakfast food.  I got this egg and jalapeno burrito thing with this sort of runny but generally pretty tasty salsa and I wanted to shower in the burrito filling.  I would have bathed in eggs and salsa if only to prolong my experience with this semi-breakfast burrito thing.  I would have married it and had kids with it and bought a house in Michigan nearby a really good school district.  I fell in love with the egg jalapeno burrito thing, I would cuddle with it on weekday mornings and plan trips to national parks with it.  

It was also nice sitting on the patio considering the weather is so pretty and the staff was attentive and friendly and slightly charming with their loafers and novelty socks (is that part of the required uniform I wonder?)

I'm deducting one star for the sheer fact that this place was filled with rich, middle aged white yuppies talking about golfing and/or glued to their cell phone.  The boyfriend and I, being young dirty Mesa kids still slightly intoxicated off Four Lokos, felt mildly out of place in this setting and were a little over whelmed by the amount of yuppie whiteness.

Nonetheless, the food was worth the trip and the cozy patio on a Sunday morning was a nice change from, you know, Cheerios on the futon while watching exercise equipment infomercials."}
{"text":"It was a very pleasant experience. There was a wait, as expected during the busy hour, but it wasn't very long (10 minutes maximum). Our waitress, Taylor, was extremely nice and answered all our questions thoroughly. They are very on top of things here, including switching out semi-full sugars for full ones and cleaning tables quickly. I ordered the Apple Jack pancake along with a cup of their soup of the day, Potato Corn. The pancakes here are humongous so come with a large appetite if you plan on ordering one! The soup was also very delicious and my mom said it was better than her favourite, Mimi's. We are definitely planning on coming back in the [hopefully near] future."}
{"text":"Since we were in the area, we had to go to T.C. Eggington's for breakfast. I checked other reviews as  the opinions are always interesting.

We arrived here around 10AM on August 18, 2014. This was my second time here and no changes were noted. Service was excellent as everything was addressed in a timely manner.

I ordered the cheese omelette with bacon with English muffin and breakfast type potatoes. My photo of this was taken after I applied ground pepper--not served that way so there's no concern for others. The bacon bits were throughout and on top, very good. My wife odered the scrambled egg special that she enjoyed.

The restrooms were very clean but somewhat hard to find. There's a sign stating \"RESTROOMS\" but only the ladies room was there. The men's restroom was on the other side of the restaurant. If that's  my only negative issue, it's a nonissue to be sure.

We enjoyed our breakfast and look forward to return for another great meal!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, service was prompt and the ambiance was true to the brunch experience. A little more upscale and a great place for a quiet brunch to catch up with a group of friends."}
{"text":"This place means business when it comes to breakfast. The portions are enormous and everything is made using super high quality ingredients. The french toast slicers were as big as my face and the bacon is super thick cut. Any place that serves you see-through floppy meat should not be able to call it bacon!

The service was average but the food is where it's at! There's this awesome apple cinnamon jelly on the table for your biscuits too. Easily my favorite breakfast place. I just wish they were open later because I like breakfast at all times of the day."}
{"text":"I went to TC Eggington's today, and had the Phoenician Chicken Feta Grille, but had it on an onion bun instead of a pita...and OMG is was so good.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, lots of gooey melted cheese, the dipping sauce they gave was to die for.  Nice big piece of watermelon.  They served it with the chef's choice of salad, which was the pasta salad that was drowning in the mayo based dressing.  I didn't eat that.  I would have given it 5 stars if that  pasta salad hadn't been included.  The service was great, ice T glasses kept filled.....you can't miss on this one.  Try it."}
{"text":"As indicated in my previous review this place wasn't high on my list to return to, but we were going right by there and I've never had an issue with the food, so why not.  Well, yet again, the table was sticky.  We watched our server and the owner push two dirty tables together for an 8-top, remove all the dirty plates, glasses, etc, and not wipe the table down.  Then, after the couple next to me left, the server cleaned off the dirty dishes and gave a cursory wipe of one corner with a rag.  The owner comes along to seat the next guests, notices the water ring on the table, wipes his right hand through it, and then spins to shake the hand of the next guest.  

I'm in the dirty table Twilight Zone.

And this time because our server was busy bussing tables, our food came out lukewarm, and Mr. M's yolks were cool and had solidified under the heat lamp.  

Hire.  Some.  Bussers.   

I want to like this place, but now I know the tables are a petri dish.  Good luck.  I will not be back again."}
{"text":"+/- Food 
+ Vanilla Latte 
+ Service 
+ Ambience/Atmosphere 

They have a well oiled machine here, the hosts/hostesses, servers, and busboys were efficient and quick! Came here Sunday morning around 9, a nice little wait (20-30 min) because of the number of people, and possibly because a spring training game later in the afternoon. Pro-tip (something I observed), if the host asks how many people you have and you say 4 adults and one toddler, that's still considered 5 people. Host won't seat you any sooner because your toddler stopped being a person, and you'll waste less time than having a 1-2 minute back and forth with the host about \"really just have 4 people and a toddler\"; also people behind you won't be as annoyed. But it provided me thorough entertainment. 

So what we are really all here for is the food. I would say solid choice and a large menu of a variety of things to choose from. I ordered a vanilla latte and Eggington omelette, subbing the English muffin for a blueberry English style muffin (25 cents extra if you do this, or so it says on my bill). The vanilla latte was nice and it's something I would order again. I'm not a self proclaimed coffee connoisseur; I'm a Starbucks fan. So if you have a Starbucks palate you'll like the vanilla latte.

On to the food, the omelette was covered in hollandaise sauce with cream cheese sitting on top. I wasn't sure what to do with the cream cheese so I tried to spread it around but ended up putting some on the potatoes, which is an awesome combination by the way. The omelet was stuffed with a lot of broccoli, some large uncooked mushroom, and small amounts of chicken. I might have gotten a fluke because of the rush and the multiple large tables around. I would have preferred the broccoli and mushrooms to be chopped smaller and mushrooms cooked longer. I had a couple raw mushrooms because of the size and I'm personally not a fan of raw mushrooms in cooked/warm food. I enjoyed the omelet even with its pitfalls, but I would like to try something else in the future. I can't provide a review for the muffin because I was too full to even eat it. Ended up taking it to go but it looks and smells delicious. 

Setting is nice, I like decorations, the fresh flowers on the table, and the carafe of water on the table. I think the main selling point was the service. My server was AWESOME, attentive even though he had a large table and many more to attend to, I noticed him running around a lot tending to many tables. Generally single diners are forgotten and left on their own but wow! Everyone was so nice and really did what they could to get the process streamlined with the number of people waiting. 

I enjoyed the food here, and would love to come back to try their other items. I think they need to create a formalized wait list versus having it on multiple legal pads."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast, it's the best in town! So easy to make changes to the plated order when I'm counting calories! Love the omelettes, pancakes are fantastic (try the blueberry) the parlour potato's are a favorite of my boyfriends. We try to get there before 9:30 to avoid the wait. They offer coffee if your aren't immediately seated and have a nice area to wait. The staff is super friendly and so on top of service. Nicely dressed wait staff and bussers. Most of all this place delivers artfully assembled food, exceptional service and consistent quality. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Shop Local. This place is one of the best local breakfast spots in the East Valley. Great place to cater breakfast food, group meet-ups, 1:1s with clients, or brunch with friends."}
{"text":"TC's isn't a bad spot for breakfast. The pear omlette is my favorite with cottage cheese. Worth a try- plan on a wait."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to eat breakfast you should try T.C. Eggington's  they give you big portions and lots of bacon try it I know you will come out very happy"}
{"text":"A delight every single time. Wonderful blueberry shakes and breakfast hash browns/potatoes, laid out well on the plate. Pretty big serving sizes too. Complete with fast, courteous service! 

Tucked away in a dying city and a dying strip mall, this place always had customers and sometimes even a short wait.

Oh, and just name an obscure type of egg and you'll get it! :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and fantastic service. Joseph was an incredible waiter who made sure our large party had everything we needed for a great brunch! Amazing experience!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast. If you are a native like me, you know this place well because T.C. Eggington's has been serving the Valley some of the best breakfast since the mid 80's. I think what I really love about T.C. Eggington's is the family feel environment they create in their restaurant. The decor makes you feel at home and the employees work hard to maintain friendly customer service. The food is prepared fresh and the portion sizes are pretty generous. I usually get the eggs benedict but opted instead for their Pumpkin Walnut Pancakes - a Fall favorite of mine. If you are wanting to get in the spirit of Autumn, take a bite of this yummy goodness. I came with a bunch of friends and we had a wonderful experience. You can also check out their sister restaurant Ncounter in Tempe."}
{"text":"I have not been here for over 10 years.  I arrived early knowing this place gets packed.  I am on a trek to find the best Eggs Benedicts in Phoenix so I thought I would order these since a friend posted a pic on FB.  The plate was very attractive and when I tasted the 1st egg benedict, I was almost going to say \"never again\".  The egg, candaian bacon and english muffin were wonderful but the Hollandaise Sauce was bland (watery).  BUT the 2nd egg benedict had that hollandaise sauce flavor that I so love.  Therefore, I'll be back for more eggs benedict.  I am not sure why 1 was watery and the other was spot on flavorful - but please be sure to tell the cooks that they got it 1/2 right.
Everything else about the place was wonderful - even the crowd coming in were very friendly and spoke to us.  Much appreciated."}
{"text":"Decided to try this breakfast place that actually got good reviews. Was seated right away. Place looked nice, lots of
space and country decor. Tables had carafes of ice water which is nice in AZ. Ordered decaff and o'pear eggwhite omelet. Quick and friendly service. My meal was served with potatoes and English muffin. The omelet was good maybe too much Havarti cheese and the bacon was kinda bland. The pears were tart and my muffin was cold. $13 not bad but shoulda hooked myself up at home! Would give it a other whirl, wasn't terrible but nothing to run back to."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the late 80s. I love their Crab Stuffed Pastry! It's my favorite!"}
{"text":"Really good omelettes for a fair price.

Service was kind of meh."}
{"text":"Now this is definitely a place you have to go for breakfast and brunch! I'm here for business and found this on Yelp as I was looking where to grab some great eggs benedicts. 

And let me tell you, this place treats their eggs B with a lot of love and respect. Probably the second best I've had. Most breakfast place miss the fact that eggs B is all about the hollandaise sauce and the poached eggs. You want to slice and take a bite of that gooiness and they do Eggs B the right way. Also they give you freshly squeezed OJ and not just coming out from a box or bottle. 

You must try this once and you will be coming back again like me!"}
{"text":"The food was really great and I enjoyed the rustic theme. I got the omelette with kalamata olives, zucchini, feta and tomato and it was delicious! My boyfriend got the crab pastry and it was delicious but a bit rich with crab, cheese and hollandaise. The potatoes are cooked perfectly! My only criticism is how the wait list is handled. It's all on paper and not very organized. Crowds are standing huddled in the front room and half the people said they called in, and it just seemed a bit hectic with the hostess and all. Apart from that, a great breakfast place!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The lattes a great, the service is quick and the food is fantastic! Try the white chocolate raspberry latte and the chipotle breakfast burrito. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Pancakes and French toasts are huge! Just wish they would serve waffles as well."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! I didnt have to wait long for a table and when we were seated we were greeted with a smile and fantastic service. I had the Eggs B. and I love that meal, so having ordered it all over, I am picky, this one was fantastic. 
Go check it out and enjoy"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for nearly 20 years with friends for our annual Christmas Eve breakfast. Just fantastic food. Started coming bi-weekly for brunch with my brother, who's an exec chef and says he hasn't found a better breakfast place. Love it. Great prices, very fresh food, and excellent service."}
{"text":"Best omelet ever.  The O'Pear Grenache omelet was incredible, I tasted my companions and was immediately regretting my choice of French Toast.  The French Toast was really good, but didn't compare to that omelet.

The service was incredible.  The place was absolutely packed, but my table of two never lacked for attention.  What we did lack was space!  The table we were at was TINY, our meals and drinks barely fit on the table. The restaurant itself is not large, it is actually quite cramped.  Don't go here if you are bothered by crowds and cramped quarters.  It's also quite loud on weekends, conversation was difficult.

We went on a Saturday around 10am.  We managed to get a table immediately, but it looked like most others had about a 15 minute wait."}
{"text":"This is an excellent breakfast restaurant...also good for lunch.  They have a huge selection of both standard, as well as unique menu items.  My family and friends have been going to TC's for years...I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by our family in AZ while we were visiting. Positives: food was good, nice portions, waiter checked on us regularly, no wait, no loud kids, friendly staff. Negatives...... nothing really. We didn't have any complaints. Portions were enough that we didn't eat all our food."}
{"text":"I don't live in the Phoenix area but if I did this would be a regular place for me.  We visited T.C. Egginton's (funky name) twice in three days while on vacation.  Good food, friendly staff and a great selection of options to pick from.  Although there is usually a line of people looking to eat the yummy food, the line seems to move quickly due to the many tables.  Looking forward to coming back here on my next trip to the PHX area."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great, quick and the establishment is very clean.  Price is a little high but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Been here twice--maybe three times? Each was for a nice-ish breakfast and each was solid enough. As the name suggests, they've got plenty of egg dishes on tap for you, with a host of omelets ready to go. I will say that I've yet to be floored by an omelet--I've tried a couple and they all sounded much better on paper, but then when they arrived I wasn't eggspecially wowed. I have no complaints, however, about that actual food and its actual taste. 

I will give a special shoutout to the house jam that's on the table. It's a little bit spiced (not spicy) and complex. Bright, but still a little moody. If you get pancakes, you might forgo the syrup and just slather on the jam. For toast, it's a must.

This is really the perfect place for brunch. They're always hoppin' and the service has always been smooth and polished."}
{"text":"Literally the best omelette I have ever had! Great setting with great staff. I recommend getting the piglet omelette! Delicious."}
{"text":"Always a solid experience here. Really good food, down to earth ambiance and friendly service. They get slammed on holidays, but they manage the crowds extremely well. Lots of breakfast options these days. Bookmark this one for your next east valley getaway."}
{"text":"One year later and we're back! And we knew exactly what we wanted... the crab pastry puffs! All three of us ordered it and it was absolutely fabulous. Did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Would recommend making reservations because this place is always busy..... going this Sunday for Father's Day!!!!!"}
{"text":"Menu has a wide variety of options and everything that my party ordered was great! I ordered the Apple Jack griddle cakes and they were some of the best pancakes I have ever had in a restaurant. However, I recommend that you share the griddle cakes. They are huge! Also one weird thing; creamer for the coffee was non-dairy creamer. We requested milk. 

I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Definitely a great Sunday brunch spot...the bad part is they usually have an hour wait at 10am when I went. 

The French Toast is the best I ever had...its not Texas sized toast its more like Alaska sized cinnamon toast.

My only real downside from being a 5 star place is a plate of French Toast is filling however i would have probably preffered 2 toast instead of 3 and it comes with a small 2 egg omlette...now that would be a perfect combo.  or even a smaller omlette, a french toast and some bacon or sausage.

They should add those kinds of deals for like 8.99 or 9.99.

Definately better than AZ Bread, Crackers...and the franchises like Good Egg, Denny's, IHOP, Waffle House...

I'm still waiting to try matt's big breakfast..."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best breakfast restaurants around.  It has continued to serve delicious and out of the usual offerings for at least the last 15 years.  The service is spot on and it is cute.  (Even the bathroom is adorable.)

Most recently I had the eggs benedict with avocado and no meat.  YUM!  Seriously good.  Looking forward to going back sometime soon."}
{"text":"I LOVE breakfast food. I will go all over and try tons of places to find the best and in my opinion this is it. Forget about all these other overpriced fancy breakfast places all over the valley....in my opinion its all overly sweet and makes you feel terrible afterwards. T.C Eggington's is SO good and they have a very normal take on breakfast, but they do it they best way possible."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast!  The eggs Benedict is by far the best I have ever had.  Served hot & delicious.  Prepared PERFECTLY every time!!   Our \"go to\" for a really good meal.  Need to try it for lunch sometime.  The service is outstanding & the owner very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! It's always crowded, but well worth the wait! Everything on their menu that we have sampled so far is just so good. The crab stuffed pastries, the Apple jack pancakes, the huevos con chorizo, hell even the jam that they have on the side. The service is always on point as well. From the moment you step in your greeted and helped, from there the waiting staff is always attentive."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast items. Hearty and full of flavor. I love the Big Hot Mama Frittata."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast loaction. The food is always good but the wait is always long. Avoid this place at all costs on a sunday... it's the place to be after church."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast spot in all the Valley of the Sun. 
We have been coming here for the past 16 years and never had a bad meal or any hiccups with the service.
The owner Tom and manager Evars will go out of their way to accommodate any clients/customers needs or desires.  Management and staff are on the whole the best in the Valley.
There are several dishes that deserve attention.  The waffles are superb, homemade with a little twist, the omelets are to die for, and the service is spectacular.  
THE BEST BREAKFAST & LUNCH RESTAURANT IN ALL OF ARIZONA."}
{"text":"I have eaten here often and the food has been wonderful every time.  The only food I didn't like was something with crab in it.  

The eggs are wonderful, bacon is the best, biscuits and gravy is terrific.  

The service it really good too.

Sitting on the south side of the building is too hot and stuffy for me as there aren't any ceiling fans.  Sitting anywhere else is very comfortable 

This is one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Only been here once, but definitely ranks as one of the better breakfasts in the Valley.

I had the Eggs Benedict. Good! My dad ordered the ham & eggs. Also good. The coffee was your typical bland \"diner\" coffee. Not a fan. They should upgrade to a more bold roast.

Overall, we were satisfied though. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Not impressed...  saw a couple reviews that were not stellar, should have listened!  Pancake was as heavy as the plate it was sitting on & the omelette veggies were supposed to be roasted, nope, raw.  Sorry, 1st & last time I'm here!"}
{"text":"NOTE: The restaurant is located right off I-60 on your right hand side, so make sure to turn into that first plaza, so that you don't miss it! 

I came here on a Saturday around 11 am, and a table for 2 was about a 15 minute wait. The restaurant is very cozy and cute, and the staff is great, full of smiles and very nice. My boyfriend and I ordered:

1) Crab Stuffed Pastry Benedict + Potatoes - The core is imitation crab with artichoke hearts on a crispy pastry, almost like a toasted croissant taste. Then, the whole thing is topped by a poached egg and plentiful hollendaise sauce. The sauce is definitely the best part of the dish. I don't care too much for imitation crab, especially if the dish costs ~$12 (quite pricey for imitation, in my opinion). The potatoes were eh. and there wasn't very much of them.

2) Eggs Benedict + Fruit  - DO NOT GET FRUIT as a side, because it literally came 
with 2 pieces of orange and 2 small slices of honeydew. Not much of a fruit salad. This was the standard eggs benedict, poached egg over canadian bacon (which was cooked well), and english muffin. The hollendaise sauce was again the star of the show, and smothered all over the plate (hopefully, you like the sauce as much as I did, otherwise it would be too overwhelming)

3) Side Fruit Salad - grapes, kiwi, apples, honeydew, canteloupe, watermelon - now that's a real side fruit salad.

Overall, the food is okay, but the service is great. I'll probably try an omelette next time."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at TC's this morning and was seated immediately. Very odd considering that it was 10:00 on a Sunday morning and there were a ton of people sitting outside waiting for a table. And no, we did not do call ahead seating either. Felt kinda bad if we did accidentally take someone's table but I was starving and what the heck was I supposed to do?
First thought when sitting down was that the uniforms that the waiters and waitresses had to wear were absolutely ridiculous and unflattering. Waist high mom khaki shorts with pastel polo's and loafers? WTF? The husband and I thought maybe they were going for an Easter theme? I actually felt bad for these poor kids. Yes, I say kids because most of them appears to be in their 20's. I also noticed that none of them were unattractive. I thought the stepford wife description I have seen in several reviews was an exaggeration but I can confirm that it is not. 
I liked that they had a carafe of ice water on the table. Also ordered the pina colada smoothie shoogle. WTF kinda name is that anyways? Well it was decent but there were lots of ice chunks and pineapple at the bottom of the glass that did not get ground up. For my meal, I ordered the farmers market eggs benny with potatoes. It was ok, just mediocre in my opinion. Being that eggs benny is my favorite breakfast, I have eaten a lot of them in my lifetime. This was one just not memorable for me. The eggs were cooked fine and overall, it was ok but the hollandaise was kinda bland not to mention was separating (I could see oil or butter separating from it) and the avocado was a little brown for my liking. The potato's were alright but nothing special. The hubby ordered the spicy Spain omelet with potatoes. The menu clearly states that it is \"drenched with salsa and sour cream.\" Yet, when it arrived, there was no sour cream. I asked the waiter and she stated that that omelet no longer comes with sour cream but she would bring us some at no charge. She later told us that the next time we ordered that omelet, make sure to ask for a side of sour cream. WTF? I guess I am just confused as to why they can't just change the description on their menu? In any event, the hub said his omelet was simply k but didn't have enough filling in it. He also said that by topping the omelet with salsa and cheese and then heating it under the broiler, the salsa had a weird consistency and that he would rather have had the salsa on the side cold instead of warm. To each his own I suppose but the fact that his omelet, like my Benedict, was nothing memorable makes me not want to go out of my way to return here for breakfast. I will say that the apple cinnamon jelly on the table was good for the first few bites but it was a bit too sweet and Cinnamoni for my liking. I also didn't even think of it before but one reviewer had a great point about the \"community jelly.\" Who knows how many nasty little mutants have licked the spoon or used that spoon on an already bitten piece of toast. 
My final thoughts: As stated before, I would not go out of my way to return. However, if someone else wanted to go or we were in the area, I wouldn't put up a fight to try it again. I would probably order the crab pastry benny next time and see if that is decent although with my meal today, I don't hold high hopes.

PS: I noticed that there were doors separating the rooms so this may be a decent spot to go if you were having a large breakfast party or meeting"}
{"text":"Really enjoyable breakfast with a solid selection of options that are locally produced. Coffee was excellent. Staff was friendly and attentive. Quick service."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed with the service. Luckily found out that they serve brown water for coffee as they serve it out front while you wait so didn't order it inside. I've had better coffee at gas stations, sadly.  My daughters poached egg came out nearly raw & when I kindly asked the waiter to have the kitchen cook it through, he acted like \"of course, no problem\" but then 10 mins later brought us an equally-- if not more-- raw egg. As a former server, I would have been embarrassed to serve it-- I mean the yolk was completely yellow, it wasn't a subtle thing. .  When my husband pointed out-- again, that the egg looked just as raw, & asked for a fully cooked egg,  the waiter stated arrogantly, \"Well, *That's* a poached egg\".  We don't work at a breakfast place, but my husband & I have both worked in nice restaurants. If there is a standard as to how poached eggs are cooked, that should have been explained either at the time of ordering, or at least after it was sent back the first time. We gladly would have changed the order to an over hard egg if the chef was too arrogant to fully cook a poached egg.  After the egg went back the 2nd time, it took at least 15 minutes for it to come back. Everyone else in our party of 8 was done eating and I asked the waiter to just box it up, at this point it was clear I was upset.  

Some restaurants send a manager over at the first sign of trouble. Most would certainly do it after the 2nd time an order gets returned to the kitchen.  Even after I was clearly upset (& yes, he knew, cause he tried not to hand the check to me & I could see his dismay when I took it) no manager came to rectify the situation and we had to pay for a meal that was never eaten   (we took it home out of principal, but I doubt at this point it will get eaten..)   I really should have asked to see a manager, but I didn't want to make our guests more uncomfortable, which is why most restaurants take the burden off the customer & automatically have mgr's come to talk to a table when there has been a problem. It is rare that I take grievances out on a servers tip, being a former server myself, but he was so clearly apathetic to the situation that I left him slightly less than 15% when I am normally a 20-25% tipper. You would think that after spending nearly $100 on breakfast (we were ordering mimosas and bloody Mary's etc...) the server would have cared a little more about his service. I guess TC Eggingtons rely's on their long standing rep but with service this bad, that balloon will eventually pop."}
{"text":"Lived up to the hype. The spicy Spain was delicious. As was the oj..very cozy spot with reasonable prices. Will go again"}
{"text":"We are in town on business and stopped in mainly based on its location to where we were. And Oh My God! The food was so good. We both had omelets and both marveled on how fresh the potatoes were and how well the omelets were made. Everything tasted so fresh! I loved the decor from the bare bulbs with the long filaments to the deep sinks in the bathroom. This place takes you to a distance place and time where the people are polite and the food is fresh. I wouldn't doubt this place is hopping on Saturday and Sunday mornings, so I would seriously consider making a reservation."}
{"text":"It breaks my heart to visit a place help up with such high reviews be such a disappointment, I stopped in for a nice breakfast with my team before a meeting and was 110% disappointed with just about everything. We were seated right away which was great but that was just about the only good thing, if I where to recommend anything here it would be the orange juice and the water the food took almost 40 minutes and was only brought to us when we inquired about it only after the server gave us an attitude as if we were a burden. When we finally received our food it wasn't made properly we had half cold half warm food not even hot it was slightly warm.... When asked by owner how our experience was he became very hostile and incredibly rude because we didn't sugar coat the awful service. I'm having an incredibly hard time understanding how they have attained such high reviews"}
{"text":"Yum-O! I had the Eggs Ben E Dict, they were excellent! My wife had the Spicy Spain omelette, which was also very good. The side potatoes are delicious. Good coffee, good food, good service and very nice and clean dining room. This will be a regular weekend (too far away from us for the weekday, but worth the drive on a Sunday morning) breakfast stop for us!"}
{"text":"2 stars because the food was good but the service was a different experience all together. We visited on a Sunday morning when it was very busy. The manager was like Henny Penny and didn't know what to do, he was trying to get his young staff to hussle in a very paniced way. I witnessed them trying to seat a handicapped woman at a table that required climbing stairs to get to? Come hear if you're type A and like to panic while you eat. Crackers and the Farmhouse are far superior in food and service."}
{"text":"Got their Eggington Omelette. Good quality eggs, and I'm definitely a fan of their chicken and broccoli. A little too heavy and rich on their hollandaise sauce. The fruit that came on the side was a nice extra!"}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day. They did a great job. Hostess was nice, server was quick and pleasant and the food was great. My son got some kind of fancy breakfast burrito with avocado in it that was amazing. I know, avocado in a breakfast burrito. Sounds gross but it wasn't. Biscuits and gravy tasted homemade  and the French toast was very good. I wish this place was across the street from my house, I would go every day!!"}
{"text":"The menu has a picture of a rather large boy, Bob Eggington, in overalls with a caption stating: \"Bob was the strongest boy with the heartiest appetite, always eager to make the pancakes. Always.\" If I ever have a kid (god forbid), I want him to be like Bob and make me some damn pancakes. ALWAYS. 

On a more serious note, Eggingtons has some intense egg dishes. I'm normally not a big fan of breakfast places since I believe you can eat such a meal much more cheaply at home and it will be just as good. Eggington moves past this dilemma by offering up some delicious egg creations. I ordered the Piglet's Passion, an omelette containing a variety of vegetables but, more importantly, bacon, ham, and sausage with assorted cheese. Did I mention it was topped with sour cream? My heart strains to pump blood through my arteries ever since. Served with potatoes and an english muffin, this place offers up some manly breakfasts. 

The other items also appear to be based on a decent premise: assloads of meat, cheese, or vegetables served with eggs in a variety of forms. I have but one grievance: the lack of low priced options. I understand why an omlette with veggies, cheese, and three types of meat will run $8.95, but it would be nice to see some other tasty, but less expensive offerings on the menu."}
{"text":"Good unknown breakfast spot.  If I am ever in the area and it's remotely near breakfast time, I stop here to eat. 

There isn't anything bad on the menu breakfast related.  The service is decent.  The atmosphere is laid back and it's just relaxing.

The average age here is probably 60, but that's part of the charm.  You can just enjoy breakfast and have some peace and quiet."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best breakfast spot in the area. I highly recommend the Croque Monsieur. But everything there is top notch. I also appreciate the fact you can call ahead and make a reservation or get on the waitlist, because my father, who is elderly, is unable to stand for long periods of time so we don't generally wait at restaurants"}
{"text":"Simply the best breakfast place in Mesa. Hands down no competition game over don't even try another place. Also just watching the owner work is a life lesson for all ages. The food is prime. In other words of the highest quality. The service is 8 out of ten stars. Needs a little polishing. But they are busy all of the time. It's not because they are busy talking about how drunk they got last night. I recommend getting the HULK to start off your morning right. Then I love there spicy Spain. I've eaten here since I was a child. I'm now 38. The quality has never gone down. I've seen them stub their toe. However never seen them crash. That's a rare thing to say about a restaurant   I've been to over a 100 times in my LIFE."}
{"text":"The in-laws took me as this morning as a belated birthday meal.  They usually go to Crackers but I found this place under one site's best breakfast, and it got pretty good reviews on Yelp so figured why not.
We went at 930 and they were busy but not busy enough for a wait...it was like people were still sitting from earlier.  The hosts seemed like a fake nice and when the bro-in-law and his girlfriend showed up, they didn't bother to bring them menus.  Never even caught the server's name but she seemed nice enough.  Two of the glasses on the table were dirty and when I handed them to her, she didn't bring new ones. It also has bad acoustics or something since it is kinda loud in the place, I kept having to have people repeat themselves. 
I specifically picked a place that made eggs benedict because it is my favorite breakfast meal.  The hollandaise sauce was really good but one egg was overcooked since the yolk wouldn't run and the other was slightly underdone because the whites were a little jiggly.  I do really like how the pancakes are huge, my daughter should have only gotten one, and how they leave carafes of water and my tea on the table so you don' t have to wait for a server to refill.  We will definitely try this place again.  This visit was more like a 3.5 instead of 4"}
{"text":"I just happened to pass by this place on my way to the airport and I was SO pleased by this breakfast spot! The place was packed on a Tuesday morning but I was sat right away. Vases of water are already at each table which was lovely. I ordered the Roasted Tuscan omelet and HOLY COW, it was the most amazing thing I have ever tasted on the egg front. I'm an eggs benedict type of girl so I kinda felt guilty going to the omelet side, but the fresh ingredients in this particular dish had me completely sold. Add some fresh coffee, bacon and fruit and I was in breakfast heaven. I even went to the grocery store today to buy some sundried tomatoes, basil and feta to recreate this dish. Loved it! Hope to go back next time I'm in Mesa."}
{"text":"It was my first time dinning here. Very warm atmosphere. The staff is friendly and we were allowed to take our time deciding on what to order. The food and coffee was delicious. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever here.  Not normal but they didn't seem to care either.  It took over 40 minutes to get food once ordered.  I asked her if it would be out soon and she got annoyed and said there were 2 large parties in the other room.  I get the kitchen getting backed up but that is no excuse for attitude and poor service.  We had to ask 3 times for refills and remind her several times for creamer.  Too far to drive for such a disappointing experience.  
Funny thing about customer service... its the only real differentiator and if you get annoyed with your customers and do nothing about it....the problem will go away.  :/"}
{"text":"Car club was there for lunch today after we all did some volunteer work. Many had been there before and they all raved about the place and the food. Very nice place, open and airy, large with some outdoor areas. They did accommodate our crowd of about 14. The menu is extensive, with breakfast, brunch and lunch. Not sure if they serve dinner as it was not on the menu or maybe that is the menu throughout the day. Orders from our diners were all over the place from breakfast to lunch items. All the sandwiches looked very good and those biting into them all said they were indeed good. I had a chop salad. It was just the right size, not too much, not too little, nice mix of ingredients including corn which added a nice crunch. It was chopped nicely for eating with a fork. But, the best part of it was the pesto dressing, it was delicious. While others took away some of their food, I ate mine all up with glee. I would give them a 5 star review but I am trying to be more judicious in giving out top awards. I would recommend T C Eggingtons and also must say that the crowd today around noon was certainly a senior citizen one.....not sure, maybe it was coupon day. But, try it, I think you will like it."}
{"text":"After reading the glowing reviews here on yelp my gf and i tried this place out this morning. The result was not what we were hoping for.

I was deciding between a couple things for breakfast and when i asked the waitress for a recommendation she didn't hesitate to say the Eggs Benedict, which is a favorite of mine so I ordered it. My gf ordered the blueberry griddle cake (read:over sized pancake). I also got a jumbo OJ and she got a rasberry chocolate latte that was a special for the day.

Had we only ordered drinks this place would have been 4 star. The OJ was nice and fresh with great taste and the latte was very good with not too sweet a rasberry taste and better than anything at starbucks for less money.

Then the food came and things went downhill. My eggs were prepared fine but somebody forgot to add any flavor beyond the smoked flavor in the ham. The hollandaise was bland, the eggs were nothing special, the standout was the potatoes but even they weren't much beyond you average ihop country potatoes. I added pepper and tobacco after the first few bites but it didn't help give any real flavor.

Sharon said the pancakes were bland as well and lacking flavor as well and only ate half based on how much there was and how she got tired of them after awhile.

The price wasn't bad and the service was only fair. It cost $30 after tip for all the food so not bad about the same as ihop but flavor didn't make it worth it. The service was fine with the exception that we called for a reservation based on some recommendations and we arrived they didn't have us on the list but we were still seated promptly. The server was helpful and promot and it was a nice touch the way they were all dressed in chino shorts and button up shirts, felt like a nice east coast yacht club."}
{"text":"5 stars all the way for this place. It was Fathers Day and pretty busy but we still managed to be seated in about 10 minutes. I was a little surprised by the veggie heavy menu, but everything was so good. I had the Eggington omelette with potatoes and their homemade English muffins. Everything was SO good. Even my Bloody Mary was thick and spicy. Our server was absolutely top-notch as well."}
{"text":"Oh, this was not good. Food not tasty. Overpriced not tasty food. If you're going to pay for a crab benedict, it should remotely taste like crab. And not be cold. Too busy, too long of a wait, too hungry to change. Other items tasted at our table did not receive much better feedback. I can't recall what others ate. In fact, there wasn't much worth remembering."}
{"text":"Best most fresh eggs benedict I have ever had in my life and I've had many. The sauce was not to thick, not too thin, not to strong.  It was perfect!  The two other people who dined with me each said it was the best omelette's they have ever had as well. They actually make their own english style muffin for the benedict so it was so fresh and tender.  They even had their own gluten free delicious bread for one of us who can not eat gluten at all.  He said it was delicious.  I'll definitely be back to his gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"A solid breakfast nook serving all of the standard fare, but in incredibly large portions.  On the plus side, this will be the only meal you'll need all day."}
{"text":"The wait for two people was about a half an hour. They had coffee labled water containers out front for people to stay hydrated which I guess the thought is what counts, but to my boyfriend's disappointment it was not actually coffee. It's a small quaint 'family-owner' styled restaurant. It was fairly neat and clean. However, they need a course for their wait staff to learn what constitutes unmotivated service to excellent service. They need two bussers just to clean off one table fast enough. The waiters all seem to go at their own morning pace and the professionality just is not there (yet they have potential). I feel that there is great possibilities for this place to become a staple in the east side of towns must-have breakfast locations.

***Their dishes taste delicious and homely-authentic. Truly wonderfully made food.***

The only suggestion I would have is reduce some of the portions down because it really is a lot to try to take in. (And people wonder why on the average, Americans are overweight)"}
{"text":"Three eggs, over easy and a side of bacon; perfect!
The staff at TC Eggingtons know how to make breakfast right, and I'll invite ALL of my acquaintances to come and have breakfast with me here ;)"}
{"text":"O. M. G. I fancy myself a breakfast aficionado, and this place blows all my other other fave breakfast places away! Unbelievably, there was not a very long wait to get seated, and absolutely everything we tried was amazing and tasted homemade. Service was impeccable - they even sent us away with some of their best homemade muffins, on the house!! Breakfast doesn't get better than this!!"}
{"text":"T.C. Egging tons is the place to go for breakfast , brunch , lunch ! Get here early because they get packed quick ! I love the \"Eggs Ben. E Dict\" so good !"}
{"text":"Quite frankly, there isn't a better breakfast in America (don't tell my wife). Although TC Eggintons is a bit expensive and always crowded, the breakfast food is second to none.

I am personally a fan of the french toast but pretty much everything on the menu is divine. 

Since breakfast is the most important meal of the day, I would start it off here."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast! I'd say 3.5 stars.

TC's has big portions and fair service. We were seated right away on a Saturday morning, so that was nice!

We ordered the super thick gi-hugeous french toast, be sure to poke holes in it with your fork and drench it with syrup --- otherwise it could be a bit dry. But it was very fluffy and delicious, we couldn't finish it all.

We also had the Santa Fe Sautee (with basted eggs) and the pear, almond, and bacon omelette (the O'Pear). These were both yummy, though the O'Pear was a bit disjointed in terms of taste. I liked it, but didn't LOVE it.

Overall it's a good place to take out-of-town friends and family."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the service was phenomenal. We got the Tuscan omelette, blueberry pancakes, and apple jack griddles. The blueberry pancakes needed to be dipped in syrup, but the omelette and griddles were great! Our waiter, Skylar was amazing! He was cheerful, helpful, and very accommodating. The atmosphere was rustic and comfortable. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We were in the PHX area and and my friend Douglas invited us to check out his home.  We were meeting in the morning and he suggested we have breakfast and that he had a good place to meet.  We were not sure what to expect...Dennys or something but when he told us where we were pleasantly surprised.  

The food we had was very good.  The wife and I shared a Santa Fe scramble and French Toast.  Both were very good.  The Cinnamon bread was thick and very good and fresh and the skillet was a good spicy.    As he mentioned to his wife we were plate cleaners and must have liked the place.  

It was clean and nicely decorated and like the old-time light bulbs.

I would definitely go back the next time we are in the PHX area."}
{"text":"WARNING: I really enjoy puns. They crack me up. 

I would like to eggs-press how pleasantly surprised I was with my egg-cellent eggs-perience at T.C. Eggington's. The waitstaff is egg-spectionally delightful and the atmosphere is cozy. Egg-spect to see long lines of egg-cited people during the weekend waiting to get in on the egg-stravaganza but the line moves pretty fast so no need to get over easy about it.

Make no yokes about it, these cooks are eggs-perts because the food is absolutely egg-strodinary! I've tried scrambled eggs to omelettes. At T.C. Eggington's they will make it eggs-actly your way. No eggs-ageration! Even if you want one of their sandwich combinations in an omelette - they will go the eggs-tra mile to make it happen. 

The O'pear and Eggington's omelette are the most popular items on the menu for a reason - they are an eggs-polsion of flavor in your mouth. The apple cinnamon jelly is also too good to egg-nore. It is available on all the tables so I'm b-eggin' you to try it on your English muffin that comes with most of the meals.

Drinks are only $5 so you have no egg-cuse not to try a Bloody Mary or a Mimosa unless you are egg-specting a little one. 

I'm a little eggs-austed now but I finally have the satisfaction of feeling like Vincent Price in an old school Batman episode. No need to continue egggin' me on, I know when it is time for me to egg-zit! But if you want a breakfast or brunch egg-cursion that leaves you sunny side up then go to T.C. Eggington's.

That's all yokes!"}
{"text":"I found this place on someone's blog I found via Pinterest. As it happened, it was right by our hotel. My husband had the Huevos con Chorizo which is served skillet style and I had the Piglet's Passion omelette which was fantastic. Often times, when there is a lot of filling, you lose the egg quality. It becomes thin and not fluffy. Well not here. It was probably one of the best I've ever had. There are so many other choices I'm looking forward to trying when we move there! Yep, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"TC Eggingtons is so Delish!! I go here for breakfast at least once every time I'm in Arizona. 
Where do I begin.. The apple jelly, the fresh orange juice, the giant blueberry pancake, and the most amazing omelette/frittata selection you can possible imagine. I highly suggest going with a group so you can sample eachothers food and split the blueberry hill pancake."}
{"text":"This place is great. The staff is so friendly and efficient despite it always being crazy busy. I love all of the choices for breakfast and can't get enough of the 5 dollar mimosas. I think this is my new Sunday spot."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and never a bad meal. The staff is always dressed professionally, its always clean and I love the decor since they remodeled. Its one of the few places my kids will eat every bite of food on their plate. The french toast and greek fetish are my two favorites."}
{"text":"Ok... I feel kinda bad about giving this place a bad review because it seems like a lot of people like it. Here's my take: It's like a bad Mimi's Cafe with it's 1980s country decor, fresh scrubbed servers in preppy polo shirts and khakis. Packed with grandparently-types and baby shower goers, my first reaction was, \"I don't want to eat here!\" But I held judgment until I tried the food. 

Our server was very nice, but wasn't really around much to take care of things - like the check. The busboy was busy checking his iPhone behind the wall. 

I got the eggs Benedict and the eggs weren't poached - maybe they were, but they were, but not in any way I've seen eggs properly poached. That's besides the point. The main concern was that they were very runny and the \"hollandaise\" sauce that drenched the plate tasted like raw, warm egg yolk, thereby soaking and making the English muffin a soggy mess under pink, falsely-ripened tomatoes. So sad... I picked off the avocado and eggs and let the rest of the dish sort of ooze all over my plate until our server appeared to ask if I was done. Indeed, I was. sigh.

My partner got the fritatta, which was more of an egg white omelette with cheese on top. Decidedly flavorless and bland. 

If you're all about paying for average food, you'll love this place. Me? Okay, fine. I'm a food snob. I'll own that."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It really left an impression on me. When we walked inside we were so disappointed we were getting our order to go. They have water pitchers and fresh flowers at EVERY table. Every table is set.  Don't even get me started on the food. My boyfriend got the the Cottage Reef omelette and I couldn't stop eating it. It has crab meat and hollandaise. It's like an explosion of flavor. Neither of us like artichokes but we ate all the artichokes in that omelette! The pancakes are HUGE and they put a giant mound of WHOLE fresh strawberries on top. Not slices. Not halves. WHOLE strawberries. You really get your money's worth here. Customer service is similarly outstanding. It makes me so sad that I live in another state now as I am longing to go back!"}
{"text":"Ate here with my mom, whom I was visiting.  We had a yummy, yummy breakfast.  I had an omelette with so much goodness: bacon, ham, olives, mushrooms, onions, black olives and sour cream.  Not only was everyone there polite and cheery- our waitress brought me a cup of coffee to go as we didn't finish the carafe on the table!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit for breakfast and I will definitely be coming back.  I had the Crack O' Dawn, which was a potato skillet with diced ham, fresh mushrooms, onions and melted cheese with two eggs on top.  It also came with an english muffin.  The potatoes were cooked perfectly and the dish had good chunks of ham.  It was excellent!  They also had homemade cinnamon/apple jam on the table to use, which I did, and it was also delicious.

My girlfriend had the Hilltop Acres, which was also a potato skillet with more vegetables than mine, but minus the ham.  She loved the flavor and the potatoes.  However, even though she is a cheese lover, she thought it was a little too much.  I noticed our neighbors ordered the french toast and that looked incredible.  

Service was great, staff was attractive, and will be going back soon to try the french toast."}
{"text":"Good place!  We didn't wait long at all for a table.  Polite young staff that are well dressed.  Food came out very quick and was tasty.  Our only \"complaint\" is that my boyfriend's English muffin was cold but he wasn't going to eat it anyways.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"this place was just ok.  I don't really get all the hype around it but wonder if there are few places for breakfast to choose from in the Mesa area.  The potatoes tasted out of the bag (frozen) and I asked for a fruit cup and the kiwi was sliced but still had the skin on it...really guys?"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch options. Love the eggs Benedict here, made with real hollandaise sauce not cheese sauce some places use. They're small juices are very small but luckily ever table has it's own carafe of lemon ice water if you're a big drinker like me. Be prepared to wait if you show up on a weekend morning, good breakfast places always have a line."}
{"text":"Opear omelet was a nice creamy, sweet bacony blend on freshness... huge fan of the havarti cheese.... give u a full coffee pot for yourself and huge water pitcher so your not constantly waiting on refills... the English muffin and homemade jam was scrumptious and last but certainly not least.. the potatoes was perfectly cooked... would recommend"}
{"text":"One of the very best places to grab some tasty breakfast. Quick and very friendly staff. Tried almost complete menu, and haven't found anything I wouldn't try again."}
{"text":"Imagine...you walk into a restaurant.  All the waitstaff is dressed like they belong in the fifties with collared shirts, long khaki shorts, colored socks and loafers.  How could it get better than that?  

Well, it does.  The skillets are the best I have ever had.  This whole in the wall, strip center joint is my favorite brunch place...and on the weekends, prepare to wait.  I have dined at the celebrity infused bruncheries in NYC, all the brunch places I can find in Dallas, but still no one can match the Eggington cajun potatoes.  They are perfectly crispy and have a little kick.  I have heard great things about the sandwiches and soups, but I always opt for breakfast when I am in the Valley."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING. First, we were seated within 30 seconds of walking in the door at brunchtime on a Sunday. Our server, Valdie, was fabulous. She helped us to pick out the best menu items for what we were looking for. The meal was huge, especially for what we paid. The only regret I have is being uncomfortably full from eating too much delicious breakfast food and that I had to pick only one of the great menu options."}
{"text":"This place has both good service and very good food. The eggs Benedict is my favorite and the portions are large. Decently priced and good parking."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite breakfast/brunch restaurant. The food is \"eggcellent\" and the service is fantastic. When there's a birthday meal to be had our daughters always ask to go to TC's. The atmosphere is very casual and the servers do a great job of helping us celebrate. You should give it a try, most likely you'll be back soon to share your experience with someone else!"}
{"text":"I've had this place on my radar for awhile now, having checked out their menu online, I was wanting to try the pear omelet.  A friend and I stopped in after the National Kidney Foundation Walk and I expected for a late Saturday morning to find a line and a long wait.  I was surprised when we were seated immediately.  The atmosphere was like being in someone's home, very homey and comfortable.  I must say though, I was a little grossed out by the thick gray carpeting, it just looked dirty and and didn't feel very sanitary to me.

My friend and I both ordered the pear omelet and it was good, not great.  Needed more pears in it if you're going to name the dish after them.  We noticed what others were eating and I must say I'd probably come back to try the fantastic looking french toast!  

All in all I thought our experience was just average, nothing really stood out as being all that good or bad."}
{"text":"this is prob the only az breakfast eatery that the husband and i have frequented numerous times over the years. we've always had good service and great food here. the only downside (for me) is the odd down-home americana decor. i could do without it.

my fave is the eggington omelette. SO GOOOOOD! and the red hot mama. love the spice. husband enjoys the pig omelette and other meaty spicy goodness. 
the only thing i've been underwhelmed with is the O'pear. It is unique and not terrible, just not my personal favorite combo of flavors. 

LOVE the pastel polos (not so much the pleated khaki shorts) that all of the workers wear!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times -- and need to go back for at least two more handfuls to try all the delicious things on their menu!  I'd advise going during the week, if possible.  On weekends the wait can be 30-40 minutes (long by Arizona standards).  

Past choices included the crab and artichoke omelet, the crab topped pastry with poached egg, or French toast made with cinnamon bread, then dipped in a custard-like batter.  This past visit I had the Farmer's style Eggs Benedict that piled tomato, spinach, and avocado on an English muffin, then a poached egg and Hollandaise sauce.  Scrumptious!  The only thing I don't think I'd order again are the smoothies.  My adult son agreed -- healthy, but not all that flavorful.  

Nice touches at this restaurant.  Tables are set up with a carafe of water.  The menus have actual chicken wire sealed into the front cover.  This theme is carried through on the lamps.  

Although they are known for breakfast, the lunch menu looked tantalizing, too.  Definitely a place to put on the favorites list!"}
{"text":"Went there this afternoon for a business lunch meeting and will definitely be going back. The food was fresh, light, and delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place. It was one of the first breakfast places I went to when I moved here. Their pancakes are huge and very good. I always get the chocolate milk...the whipped cream is amazing. I LOVE the omelette with crab and cream cheese..ooooh it's so yummy! The service is always good, we have never had any issues. It is always packed in the mornings and for good reason. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"We found this place about a year ago and go at least once a month. Their menu is fantastic. Everything we have tried is sooo good. My favorite is the Farmers Market Benedict. Although the French Toast is to die for. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go in Arizona for breakfast wish they would open one out here in California"}
{"text":"Today was the first day I've been to this restaurant. A couple of my friends and I stopped in for breakfast. Probably one of the best eggs Benedict plates I've ever had. Our server was very kind and did a wonderful job. I would recommend this food to both varieties of guests, those looking for a healthy light meal (they offer gluten free) as well as those looking for the delicious desert style waffles. Wish I could add another star!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I and two others ate here yesterday morning Dec. 26th, It was
wonderful, the restaurant was very charming in decor and the food
came out hot, fresh and very delicious. Our waiter was very good as well.
Kept our drink full and was helpful to a few of us that have never been here
on what to order. All 4 of loved the food."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Anything you order on the menu!! Everything is delicious!! TC's has become a ritual for my girlfriends and I to go to for Sunday breakfast. We always have great service and food."}
{"text":"Lackluster, flavorless breakfast. Do not go out of your way to come here. I was shocked at how many people were waiting to eat here. I ordered the poached eggs with toast and potatoes. They overcooked the eggs; a place with the word EGG in the title should be able to properly poach an egg. The potatoes were very basic and sad. The bacon my dad ordered was fatty and kinda undercooked. The big killer is that the prices were more expensive than a diner yet the quality of the food was the same."}

{"text":"Had breakfast here with the parental units the other day.  Called ahead seating at 8:30 to be there at 10:30.  Good idea because it was very busy when we got there.  We waited about 5 minutes for our table.  The place is bigger than it looks and there is a whole parking lot for parking.  Although there wasn't enough handicap parking for my dad's taste.  

The menus have a huge variety of breakfast and lunch items, including vegetarian fare.  The cover of the menu has a piece of chicken wire under the plastic that I thought was particularly clever. 

We ordered coffee all around, and it was hot and tasty.  i had the Farmer's Market Eggs Benedict which added sliced tomato, avacado and sauteed spinach to the traditional dish.  it was soooooo good, I wanted to scream it from the mountain tops!  I kept saying, \"mmmm.   mmmm.\" as I chewed away in heavenly delight.

M had chorizo and eggs and he ate about 3/4 of the huge plate.  Mom had an egg beater omelette, but it was covered in too much cheese, she only ate about 1/4 and felt ill.  Too heavy for her taste.  Dad had the wheat germ pancakes (he actually ordered the \"germ pancakes\") we all laughed.  they were sooooo good, I wanted to shout some more.  They were warm and soft and chewy and nutty and sweet.  OMG!  They didn't even need any syrup, although dad got sugarfree syrup that was awfully sweet anyway.  They came in a serving of 2.  I, personally, would have added bacon with them to get the salty/ sweet action going.

Breakfast and coffee all around cost us $47.  A little pricey, but the food was really good.  I would come back here in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Wonderful example of having a truly delicious fresh homemade meal, except your not at home. You're  at T.C. Eggington's!

Our Sunday Brunch roost was made special from beginning to end. Too warm a day to sit the the patio, we opted for their indoor seating. Although busy, they sat us down immediately. Happy happy!

Mimosa's on the menu made me happier therefore we started with those. 
Miss Kelly was delightful and patiently helped with menu questions. Great,  because they have a marvelous variety of food choices and a few are ever so slightly different. But still different.

We ordered 3 main dishes being: Crab Puff, Eggs Benedict, and Piglet's dish. Additionally ordered the Plain Pancakes and a side order of bacon to share (with our table) 
Easy to understand why this place rocks! Everything came out just made, piping hot and tasted very fresh indeed. We ate in total comfort and friendly warmth service this restaurant exudes. 
One impressionable feature for me was the Coffee Flask left at the table for us to refill our... Coffee! We love having a hot full cup while eating breakfast and therefore with that result, sealed this 5 star deal!"}
{"text":"Went here on vacation and used yelp to find a healthy breakfast. Went there on a Monday morning and there was no wait. Really nice decor, with a cold pitcher of ice water on the table. The menu is so cute and unique with chicken wire on it! I had the Greek omelet and it was delish. The potatoes are nice and crispy and not greasy!! Food was a little slow coming out but worth the wait. It has unique omelet and egg selection that I think will please everyone. I will note that like other reviews I did feel under dressed..."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while. Thought we would try on a Friday versus a busy Saturday or Sunday. Guess I was wrong. Didn't look that busy. We ordered and really didn't notice how long it was taking for our food, but then everyone else was getting there's and we weren't. Waiter was no where to be seen. Finally a manager I presume came over and said sorry our ticket got lost in the grill or something like that. Finally got our food. The food was great. Service not so much. The waiter should have been more attentive and let us know before the manager had to step in. I am used to if something happens you comp something or do something extra to get us to come back. Not here.I guess saying sorry was enough. Oh well.Bye Bye Felicia."}
{"text":"We never go to breakfast, but glad we did.  Happen to be in the area and great place.  Good portions, good value.  Had the breakfast Chorizo and was really really good.  If it was a bit closer to home would definitely go back.  If I'm in the area, we will be going back!"}
{"text":"Quite lovely place to have Breakfast/Brunch. The ambiance was warm and fairly quiet. The food was wonderful! They have a great menu with lots of options depending on what you like, should be something for anyone, including the kids. I can also speak very highly of our service, as our server Alex very graciously discussed some of her recommendations with us. Great experience overall! We will be back, maybe tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This place is busy! That alone speaks for itself. I made a healthy choice which doesn't always equate to tasty, but that's not the case here. I had a very tasty breakfast! I would bring out of town guests here for an affordable and delicious breakfast. The menu is extensive. The decor is welcoming. The staff handled the mass of people with care and ease. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was in Arizona for Spring Training recently and had a chance to try some breakfast at T.C. Eggington's.  The omelet was delicious; the cheese and vegetables were mixed perfectly with the fluffy eggs. 

I was also impressed by the homefries.   Though there wasn't any particularly unique seasoning, the homefries were technically sound with each potato crisp on the outside and soft on the inside."}
{"text":"I've always loved this place, been coming here for many years and I get the same thing - French toast or Eggington Omlet. There is usually a 15-30 minute wait because they are a popular place but once you're at the table service is quick! The people here are nice and the food is the best!!"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful experience.  Our service was stellar. The waitress was friendly and helpful - she shared recommendations of her favorite dishes and was there when we needed something.  We all had omelettes.  Two Mediterranean Omelettes,  one Crab and Artichoke, and the fourth was Eggington's Omlette with ham, tomatoes, Swiss cheese and Hollandaise. They were each delightful. Our friends said they were the best omelettes they had ever eaten.  Can't ask for better than that!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and polite and the food was absolutely excellent! Despite the 35 minute wait it was well worth it and we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I read below that this restaurant is a great place to take your mom out for breakfast... so hey, I listened, and decided it'd be worth a try. My mom and I headed out Sunday morning to grab a nice meal and catch up. Well unless your idea of bringing mom out to breakfast is causing her to have an aneurysm then this isn't the place for you. Look, I'm patient, but when I walked into a restaurant and try to simply put my name on the waitlist and get shoved aside by other patrons, that's strike 1. When the manager and his five unhelpful staff of chickens run around like their heads are cut off, that also worries me. Does it really take 6 people to man the front of the restaurant -- and by man I mean disregard customers? Glad I walked out before being sat down because I'm sure the kitchen is in as much disarray as the entrance."}
{"text":"I love the service and the amount of food you get. I think the pancakes are amazing.
I order the omelets and the plain and simple."}
{"text":"I've heard that TC Eggington's is good so I thought I would give it a try.  

Service was good but not great.  Server was pretty busy even though there were not that many patrons at that time.

My breakfast was 2 eggs, potatoes, sausage and pancakes.  Eggs and potatoes were good and cooked as I requested.   I didn't love the sausage, but the pancakes were the biggest disappointment.  For me, pancakes are what separate breakfast restaurants, but these were nothing special for a couple reasons.  First, they were barely warm and I think they just had there sitting while the other food was finished.  They looked like they had been sitting for a while.  Second, they tasted like they were out of a box.  Maybe I had too high of expectations, but they were just not that good.  Not terrible, just not great.

The kicker for me was that apparently what I ordered wasn't one of there set meals.  Therefore, she pieced together each item a la carte.  So for 2 eggs, potatoes, sausage and pancakes it was $20.  I was very surprised by this and more surprised the server didn't give me a heads up.

So overall, based on my experience, I would say the food is average but the price was way too much."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place for breakfast!! I can't believe I haven't been here before, but I can promise it won't be my last. Love the whole atmosphere and service. Food was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!!! Nice little brunch place! I had their chorizo skillet and it was to die for, I also had it with their pumpkin spice latte. Yum! Service here was excellent. Felt like I was home. Definitely will come again!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast spot. 

Besides living around the corner, their food and their service is always amazing. You'll usually see people waiting outside on the weekends and cop cars in the parking lot which are both good signs of a legit spot.

It's a step above all of the normal, plain, franchised breakfast spots. I like supporting local, family owned businesses, especially with the do it so well."}
{"text":"So many items on their menu are amazing, I hate to mark it down 2 stars, but they get a solid F for finishing touches.  Margarine instead of real butter (unless you specifically ask for it,) non-dairy \"creamer\" instead of cream or half and half (the best they can do for your coffee is whole milk,) and the whipped cream tastes like play doh.  It has to come from a can.  Seriously, I have no idea why they make such delicious breakfasts like their huge,thick, French toast, their mouthwatering English bran muffin, spicy Spain omelette (a paleo dieter's dream if you sub out the tortilla and potatoes,) or the rich and amazing crab dishes.  There are too many outstanding dishes to name. So why skimp on the little things and diminish the whole thing?  I have no idea.  I've submitted this idea to the manager on several occasions, and been summarily ignored.  It's a shame.  Because of the insistence on using sub-par dairy, we don't go there very often."}
{"text":"Absolutely best brunch place in town! Only bad thing is, that it is so good, it is always crowded!"}
{"text":"Food and service is great.... Sunday .... Get there early.. lots to get of the menu.
Pancakes looked great."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I love it. They have great English muffins and they cook everything perfect. I will definitely be going back! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast restaurant I have had the pleasure of visiting. The food is excellent and the service is always very good."}
{"text":"Meh. Bland French toast. Bland eggs and chorizo. Ambiance reminds me of Bob Evans or IHOP. The raspberry white mocha is way too sweet (and I asked for half the syrup). They're not getting my business again."}
{"text":"I had to up my review a star because I realized that their Huevos Con Chorizo Skillet is one of my favorite breakfasts of all times.  And we went on a Tuesday at mid-morning so it wasn't packed and the service was good."}
{"text":"We have lived here for almost 5 years and we just found this place!  We are always on the hunt for a great bfast place.   I"}
{"text":"I was a regular at TC Eggington's for four years. And when I say regular, I mean every weekend.

The owner, Tom is probably the nicest man you will ever meet. He is extremely welcoming and friendly, even when the place is packed out. He never seems to forget a face and you feel like he's been waiting for you to walk in.

Ok...so now, the most important part of this, the food. Incredible. I mean, what other place do you know that can make something as unappetizing as a bran muffin taste so good that you'll be asking for another one after the first bite? This place.

Aside from the bran muffins, they have an amazing omelet, the Spain. It's just the right amount of spicy or the Vegetable Gardena fritatta. They even make oatmeal that tastes like it came from a gourmet kitchen. Seriously, what other place makes oatmeal like this??

And they must only hire the cutest servers, the girls are all wholesome and sweet, with cute little patterned socks and loafers. It's almost like if you aren't attractive, you are immediately dismissed from the hiring process.

If you haven't been here, you need to march your breakfast loving booty here now and order your heart out."}
{"text":"I order the cheeses Galore omelette, all I can say is Oh Lawd!   It was good and definitely will clogged the pipes for a few hours.  But damn it was so so good, make you want to slap the person next you, good thing I was by myself.  I usually eat turkey bacon but I wanted to try the regular bacon and asked for it to be crispy, and they were very very crispy to my satisfaction.  I highly recommend this spot, and leave the belt at home."}
{"text":"Toto we aren't in AZ anymore...it was like stepping into Connecticut! Very yuppy, sail boat outfits! Ok ok back to the actually experience, I called to make a reservation and they hadn't even written my name down until I came in and told them I called, so then we waited 5 mins. I ordered the raspberry white chocolate mocha which was pretty good and not overkill on the price. Then I had the blueberry girdie cake-no flavor! Bland blueberries and dry, not great pancakes. And if you didn't want some sort of egg dish, you are pretty sol!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here.

Whether it's for a post party hangover cure or a brunch celebration, TC's has always been my go to. The menu is littered with brunch classics that I always have a hard time choosing.

I love all the benedicts, the huevos con chorizo and the Santa Fe sautee (don't forget to ask for extra tortillas). The last time I went I got their sausage gravy and biscuit special and it was delightful!

Love their vanilla latte with whip cream or their mimosa.

You can't go wrong with anything here!"}
{"text":"1st MAKE RESERVATIONS or you'll be disappointed. Their menu offers a wide variety of yummy stuff! As it was hard to chose just one, I was lucky to be in a group. Their omelets ARE JUST GREAT! I had the Mediterranean, but also got to try the  spicy, the piglet pleasure (or something like that) and the Spanish. If you are not used to big portions, make sure to ask the half size, or you'll end up with your doggy bag. IT is too good to leave it!!

My group was smart enough to make a reservation and we had to wait just 15 minutes. Good service, although the waitress forgot that we needed separate checks...still, she was friendly enough to compensate :D

(still satisfied from Brunch!!)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and was very pleasantly pleased. Had the O'Pear Grenache Omelette. Was excellent! 5***** rating from me! Will definitely visit again!!!"}
{"text":"When we eat out for breakfast with my parents on the East side of the Valley, it is always at TC Eggington's.

Though we only make the drive across town a couple of times a year we are always greeted by name (we used to live on this side of town and came more often). 

My wife swears by the crab cakes and I highly recommend the Crack o' Dawn. Also the apple jam on english muffin is not to be missed.

If I could eat here for breakfast every week I would."}
{"text":"Good breakfast joint to add to the rotation if you are in the east valley. I've been a few times and been pleased overall. Today I had the apple griddle cake and it was delicious. Topped with cooked apples, dark brown sugar and pecans, and it's HUGE. I managed to eat about 3/4 of it. I probably could have finished but I had to get a side order of their house potatoes which are always seasoned and prepared well. Love 'em. The french toast is great too, but again massive so probably best split between two people. The only dish I wasn't pleased with is the Crab Pastry. The eggs, crab, and hollandaise sauce are delicious, but the pastry part leaves much to be desired. It was so hard that when I took a bite at first I thought there was a piece of well done bacon in it! The other thing is they put an entire large artichoke half on each pastry. Would be much better if they chopped that up and incorporated it into the dish in some other way. Hopefully they read this and make some improvements because I love the concept of the dish. Other than that, great service and decent prices. A-OK for sure :)"}
{"text":"T.C Eggington's is a great place to have breakfast I have never been disappointed with it. The service is great and the servers are friendly. If you just drop in on a weekend plan on a wait they are always busy. :-)"}
{"text":"Great place. I would give it 5 stars if it were larger (and the lines smaller) and if the greeter/server's stringy black hair would have been tied up. It was dragging in the food as she bent over to put the plates on the table.  But I will be back!"}
{"text":"This was the cutest little spot with friendly customer service. You can tell they really care about the customers and want to provide great service. As for the food it wasn't as spectacular as I thought it would be.

I went for brunch with a friend. We ordered mimosas first and scoped out the menu. We decided to both get the Simple Breakfast, mine with bacon and hers with sausage. Plus 2 pieces of French toast to split, since all the reviews mentioned it. Everything seemed pretty normal, nothing great but the eggs seemed greasy or water downed. I would have to say the potatoes were the best part with some hot sauce and the apple cinnamon jam. As for the French toast it was a little on the dry side. Once you drenched it in butter and syrup it was ok. 

I gave it 3 stars because the place is cute with the friendliest workers. The food was good but nothing out of the ordinary compared to any other breakfast place."}
{"text":"I couldn't decide what to get so I just got simply scrambled eggs potatoes bacon. For a simple breakfast it was pretty off the charts bacon was crispy and unlike any I've ever had eggs were cooked perfectly and the potatoes are my favorite part, individual little bite-size pieces of crispy potato along with my two breakfast complements, ketchup and tabasco sauce. The menu was a little too big for my liking and a breakfast place but I'm sure I could find something even better next time"}
{"text":"Walked in and place was pretty packed but i was seated right away.... Courteous and attentive service....

There menu was very fancy pants and a lot of the stuff looked very good. 

I just ended up ordering there equivalent of a Denver omelet.... Came with home fries and an English muffin. The potatoes were spot on and only needed a tad more salt. The omelet was delicious but the standout to me was the homemade apple cinnamon jam they have on every table.... 

Coffee was solid and there was a craft of water on every table as well.... All in all good place for brekky!!!"}
{"text":"Meeting a friend before heading to the airport.  Had a great meal.  Every dish was tasty with very fresh ingredients.  

Used the tip to call ahead and bypassed a lot of people waiting outside on an unseasonably chilly phoenix morn."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding!  The breakfast menu is large enough that there is something for everyone. 

 I went with the farmers benedict and added bacon.  The eggs were poached to perfection, the hollandaise was creamy and decedent and the bacon was thick and cripsy!  The bloody mary was perfectly spiced to perfection and looked to have fresh horseradish.  A perfect morning pick me up. 

The wait staff were friendly, attentive and had great attitudes."}
{"text":"Went here based on the Yelp reviews and it was close to where I was going to have a meeting my group was seated immediately which was nice but that's where the fairy tale ended. I asked for a recommendation on what was the specialty of what was good and the lady setting up the table said \" I don't know you have to ask your server\"? Who does not know what's good to eat at a restraunt you work in? First red flag I probably should have left. Food was served after 35 minutes waiting, only brought after I asked what is taking so long. At the point food was half hot half cold sloppily plated and server was annoyed at us? Wow I'm the one who had got the poor service  This is where the plot gets thicker. When paying the bill the owner (saw his picture on Yelp) asks how the service was? I advised him of what had happened and he flipped out on me telling me to leave and never come back!!! What the hell is going on over there? I was confused still up to this point and walked outside stunned along with my party I came with the owner then came outside with a barade of insults telling me again to leave and never come back. He continued with well if our service was horrible how did he get good reviews and awards? I was just shaking my head actually wondering the same thing myself. I would suggest to avoid this outdated mediocre food at best ( actually being kind) and the tyrant of an owner who puts forth a kind hearted presence online saying the customer is always right!! This place is a serious joke I hope it's torn down and replaced with a new restraunt this is a shame for Mesa and the entire food community....you should be ashamed of yourself as the owner and look into some anger management and possibly some charm classes... You sir should not ask for an experience of your restraunt if the truth can't be accepted"}
{"text":"I could eat this whole place up.

I love, love, love everything on the menu, although I can rarely bring myself to stray from my favorite (Crab Stuffed Pastry). Occasionally the wait time can be a little long but the servers are always frendly. Our most recent visit was Mother's Day of this year and we made sure to get there early as they fill up extremely quickly for that holiday. We've never had bad service and the food has always been excellent."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here, and it won't be my last.  I've been wanting to eat here for years, so my wife and daughter took me as a surprise.  Very crowded, so I'm glad we called ahead.  I wanted to try something a little adventurous, so I ordered the Cottage Reef omelet.  The omelet was cooked perfectly, topped with a very tasty hollandaise sauce and had home fries on the side.  The artichoke  was a nice complement to the sweet crab, and I definitely recommend it to seafood lovers.  Our server Mallory was polite  and helpful.  Our food was brought to our table pretty fast considering how busy it was."}
{"text":"After a night of too much fun, we hit up T.C. Eggington's for a hearty breakfast before two of us had to hit the road for places unknown. Just down the road from the cuz, it was a natural choice for breakfast. Much nicer than any old Denny's or IHOP and the food is quality. The omelettes are 3-egg monsters so you'd best be hungry. My menu selection was the Morning Glory omelette which was delicious (and huge) and consisted of egg whites, cilantro, roma tomatoes, red onion (I ordered mine sans red onion) and then topped with avocado slices. I loved this tender omelette but it was way too big for me. It was served with potatoes and an English muffin. Potatoes were tender and delicious but my English muffin was pretty sad and floppy (way under toasted). 

My group had breakfast cocktails as well - a couple of mimosas, a regular Bloody Mary and a spicy Bloody Mary. I am a bit of a Bloody Mary snob and this is where T.C. Eggington's failed for me. My spicy drink was bland and not exciting at all. Our waiter mentioned that they use Major Peters Bloody Mary mix. I had to doctor mine up with some salt and pepper as well as Tabasco and it still wasn't acceptable. 

Service is attentive and pleasant. I'd definitely go back however I'd leave the Bloody Mary alone.."}
{"text":"In a way I wish I had never discovered T.C. Eggington's. Considering the fact that it's located in Phoenix and myself in Los Angeles, it makes it heartbreaking when going anywhere else for breakfast... Eggington's is that good. I can't believe that some other reviews complain about the prices... compared to every mediocre breakfast place in L.A., it's cheap but I guess for Phoenix prices it may be a little on the higher end. That said, the quality of food is so much better that it's really worth every penny. My usual favorite here is the Phinaeus Cobb sandwich... the fact that Eggington's is the first place I know of that has turned the stone classic of a salad, The Cobb, into one of the greatest sandwiches I've ever had is reason enough to check it out. In addition to the food, the service is great. During my last visit there I accidentally left my credit card behind and even though it was after hours when I came back, someone was kind enough to unlock the door and get it for me. Service doesn't get any better than that."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and it was amazing. Took forever to decide what to have.  My hubby decided on the crab & artichoke filled pastry and I had the O'Pear omelette. I don't really like omelettes. It was super happy with my choice esp loved the almonds!  Taylor was our server and she was attentive and professional.  The atmosphere was so warm and charming.
I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by here for breakfast before we headed to the airport. It was a Sunday morning so it was busy. Upon arriving, we saw people sitting outside waiting for to be seated. I was expecting to wait but when I told the greeter there was only 2 of us, we were seated right away.

The restaurant has a nice ambiance, not too loud but they definitely try to sit as much people as possible in the restaurant. It's sort of cramped if you are sitting on the small tables that sit 2 people. Despite how busy they were, our waitress was attentive and the food came out rather quickly. My wife ordered the chorizo and I had the eggs benedict along with the cinnamon toast with glaze. Their food is delicious and the cinnamon toast had huge thick slices. If I knew it would have been that big, I probably would have just ordered that alone and added an egg or something. Either way, we did a good job eating most of it.

If you're in town and want a good breakfast, you can't lose with this spot."}
{"text":"This place used to be a good spot for breakfast/brunch about a year ago.  My fiancee and I would go almost every weekend.  However, the service started to decrease and honestly the food is not that great to make one want to continue going if the service is awful.  The waitresses are great.  However, to get a seat at this place you apparently need to be elderly.  We kept watching people get seated who arrived after us when finally we spoke to Tom the host, Tom said it would be a few minutes.  The wait continued for another fifteen minutes.  Finally we go inside and see an elderly couple come in.  Tom obviously knew these people, asked how their trip was and wrote their names on the 2nd page of lists.  Another younger guy was waiting and Tom puts his name on page 4 or 5 of the list.  After witnessing this we decided to spend our money elsewhere.  Oldies, this place is for you because Tom will pay preference.  If you are young, you apparently need to call ahead or wait until all of the oldies are seated and served."}
{"text":"My Fiance and I used to come here every weekend to eat. The food was always good, and the menu choices were \"different.\" 

However I am sad to say that after more than a year of giving TC's our business we are crossing them off our list.

We arrived at 9:20ish and had our name put on the list. After we arrived several other parties showed up and were quoted 30-45 minutes to be seated.

After waiting roughly half an hour, we noticed that the parties (many with the same count as us - 2 ) were being seated. I reminded the seater/manager? (Tom) and he said \"A few more minutes.\"

After twenty more minutes we went inside to see if we were \"out of sight, out of mind\" and amazingly we were called to be seated after watching more parties of the same count be seated that arrived after us.

We declined, explained to the waitress why, and left.

This would not have been as big of an issue if the same exact thing had not previously happened the last time we ate here. We were quoted a time (and I know you can't tell how long people are going to take) and only after repeated reminders we were seated in nearly twice the time quoted.

The method they use to \"organize\" who is in line is rather silly. Two small yellow notepads with at least 4 people making changes at any given moment, in a state of confusion.

I am sad that this has happened to us (and I am sure many others) and I am not going to recommend this place any longer."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Arizona and found this place on Yelp. I absolutely loved it! Great food, service, and atmosphere. I got an omelette that I devoured immediately. The potatoes and toast with their super duper delicious strawberry preserves made it even better. This was supposed to be a quick breakfast before going to the cubs game but we definitely took our time and enjoyed every last bite."}
{"text":"After four years of living in the Phoenix area, I've finally found a favorite breakfast spot! Good food and excellent service !"}
{"text":"I have been coming here off and on since I was in high school. We don't get a chance to come very often but every time that we do the food is constantly perfect & I love that I know what the menu offers and I always leave satisfied and happy.
Thank you for always providing the best & never compromising on your standards. You have been and will continue to be an easy valley gem."}
{"text":"Wow! Just happened to be on the East side and googled best breakfast on East side. This place came up and after looking at the menu decided to try it out. We are so happy we did, BEST breakfast we have ever had. And we've been to many of \"the best of\" breakfast places. Such creative ingredients, not the same old boring breakfast items that you see everyplace else. Our breakfast took awhile to come out but we didn't care, we were enjoying a delicious Bloody Mary. Our waitress was awesome and apologized several times for the wait and upon paying the bill, she gave us a complimentary muffin, their signature bran muffin. We split it for breakfast the next day and it was wonderful. Can't wait to go back here! LOVE!"}
{"text":"Used to breakfast here when I lived in Maricopa and in Chandler (2003-2006).  I enjoyed the omelettes the best: Frattina Kalamata, Greek Fetash, and my fave Roasted Tuscan.  My last two visits I ordered the English Toast w/ French Flair and Honey-Roasted Wheat Germ.  I found TCE's French toast to be too fluffy-  I like my toasts with a lot of texture/crunch, and the wheat germ cakes were great when fresh from the \"griddle,\" but not out of the fridge.  If you're like me and like to mix textures, then you may want to order another entree and split the two dishes with someone else; otherwise, the cakes may get boring after a few bites.  To all you 100% maple syrup purists out there, you won't find the nectar served here.  They're not even available for purchase.  Just corn syrup-laced maple-flavored pancake syrup.  Eh...

I've never tried any of the smoothie/shoogles or parlour pourins, but Mom and aunt did try the mocha latte and said it was really, really good.  Indeed, the mug, brimming with dark cocoa, looked decadent (smelled sinful, too!).

I'd say my favorite singular item here is the strawberry preserves, which you can purchase by the jar and take home.  I want to say it's less than $4 a jar, but don't quote me on it.  All-natural ingredients (strawberries, sugar, pectin, and citric acid).  No corn syrup!  (Now, if only I weren't sensitive to citric acid...)"}
{"text":"I was unimpressed. I've heard great things about this place, but perhaps the hype made me expect more. I went with a girlfriend for a Saturday brunch. We sat outside and that patio area is as nice as a patio facing a parking lot can be. We split an order of eggs benedict with potatoes and the Morning Glory omelet with fruit. The eggs benedict was standard. The omelet was okay, but I've had better in much smaller establishments. For the price we paid, I expected better."}
{"text":"4 stars, but mostly because I'm biased when it comes to breakfast.

I've only been here once, but that's merely due to distance.  If you're a breakfast connoisseur (that's a thing, right?) then this place does not disappoint.  Try something exciting, like the O'Pear Grenache: pear, havarti, almonds, and bacon.  Havarti and pear go excellent together, and to put them together with almonds and eggs is unthinkable.

Except it is thinkable, and it's here."}
{"text":"My boys and I arrived around 10ish and we would've had to wait but \"Roy party of 3\" was called twice and I became \"Roy\".  Although the wait would've been worth it.
All of the staff from the seating hostess, waitress, bussers...all seemed like they liked working there and were all very pleasant.
We ordered a chicken and an egg just to see what would come first.
The drinks came quickly & just a personal preference but add some flavored creams for coffee.  My boys both had fresh squeezed OJ.
And then came the food! One of my boys ordered the bananas fosters french toast and it was sugary outstanding!! My youngest ordered the regular french toast and it was more than he could eat, which is saying something.  Since they are both in major growth spurts, they also ordered eggs and bacon....my oldest put it all down!! Unbelievable.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict which was great but could've eaten more than the spoonful of side potatoes.
Walking out I could've used a wheel barrel to cart my ass out, but we all commented on how it was one of the best breakfasts we'd had in a very long time.
Overall...eggsellent & we will definitely return.
UPDATE
Took my now 12 year old baby for breakfast. That seating hostess is awesome! She deserves a raise.
OK seriously, the service overall was excellent again but the reason for this update is because the omelet I ordered has to be the best that ive ever shoved in my face! It's called the Eggington and even I can figure out that its their signature omelet. I would describe it but I cant do it justice and Im too far away to go get one. The hollandaise is exactly how I make it & I licked the plate clean. Zane chowed dowm several bites of it while trying to get through the huge stacks of french toast. That quick growing boy couldn't do it & the leftovers were devoured. Thankfully we were smart enough to not plant ourselves on the couch afterwards or the day would've been a total waste.
This place is by far our favorite breakfast place, even if my daughter didnt work there."}
{"text":"I think I've discovered the secret location where all men and women over the age of 70 converge on the weekends: T.C. Eggington's. Walking into this place, it's as if I've been transported into some bizarro world: a senior home run by Disneyland rejects. 

The servers all have fake, tight smiles plastered to their smug little faces. Our waitress took her sweet ass time taking our orders and bringing us our drinks. She got our order wrong, but by the time she brought our food, I was starving, so I said fuck it to the fucked up order and ate the food.

If the food had been good, I would have been able to get over it, but it wasn't good. It was average - at best. And that's me being generous. 

Next time I want to be treated like shit, I'll be sure to come back here, but I'm pretty sure that time will never come."}
{"text":"So I recently got a job in the city of Mesa conveniently near T.C. And when I had to make a day trip to the joint (hardly a joint, more Scottsdale-esque) I was quickly floating on breakfast cloud 9.

I love food, and I love to eat, and I LOVE a great breakfast brunch.  This place had it all!!! We went there after my graduation from college with a bunch of family, mostly of the elderly.  Let me first explain that going anywhere with my Grandpa is a mission in itself, nothing is ever cooked right and service is always too slow however he could not stop complimenting the staff on how great everything was (first time I have ever witnessed this in 22 years).  

TC is a great place for family and celebrations or just to enjoy a great weekend brunch.  LET ME WARN YOU IF YOU GO ON A WEEKEND GO EARLY OR YOU WILL BE WAITING AROUND 30 minutes!"}
{"text":"I really can't believe I haven't reviewed this place before. This has been a family staple for us for many years. The Eggington Omelet & Eggs Benedict are my favorites. Multiple friends have Piglets Passion and the Crack Of Dawn on their favorites list. We have abandoned a camping trip at 6 am to make the trek down here from Payson for these dishes. The food is always great and the service is stellar."}
{"text":"We have had breakfast at T C Eggington's many times in the past and have always had a good experience.  This time was no different.  We went with friends and the coffee was quickly poured.  My wife had the O'Pear Grenache Omelette and loved it.  I had the Croque Monsieur, a French breakfast sandwich that I had not had in many years and also loved T C Eggington's version.  Service was great, as always.  We will be back."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in my book. The apple pancakes are amazing, as well as the French toast! I lovebthwtbthey give you a carafe of iced tea instead of constant refills. As well as a carafe of ice water with a lemon slice! This is a must try in my book!! Worth the wait and drive, amazing staff."}
{"text":"I had THE best turkey sandwich from here. Definitely will be back. I ordered from DoorDash so I'm excited to go in the establishment to experience fully!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good breakfast option in Mesa on a Monday morning and T.C. Eggington's fit the bill.  I found the whole experience sort of middle-of-the-road.  It was decorated nicely, the service was pleasant and the food was fine, nothing bad and nothing exceptional either.  I ordered the Hilltop Acres and it was pretty good, but bordering on too much cheese.  I don't know if the jam is housemade or not, but it was delicious.  Overall, this is a solid spot."}
{"text":"First off, anyone who knows me, knows that my husband and I LOVE this place.  The food is fabulous and the service has always been great.  We've been coming here since it opened and Tom C. has always worked hard to make it the best breakfast/brunch place it can be.  Well, Tom isn't around as much as he used to be (and he deserves to be enjoying his free time!) and a few years ago, he hired someone to manage the place when he's gone.  Herein lies the problem.  He isn't Tom and never will be.  I was ok with that until yesterday.  He needs more training in customer service.  When a customer comes up to you and tells you that they have a party of TEN, you do not look extra frustrated, put your head down, hand to forehead, furrowed brow, heavy sigh (every indication with body language that this is going to be a problem) and murmur something to one of the hostesses about table availability, to the point where your customer APOLOGIZES for having a party of ten.  That is totally unacceptable, and Tom, I hope you're reading this."}
{"text":"So... I wasn't a fan.
Full disclosure, we're from Gilbert where you can't throw a cow pie without hitting a breakfast place with an hour-long wait at noon. For some reason, breakfast is a *BIG* thing out here (coughcoughwhitepeople) and the competition to get people to eat your biscuits is *FEROCIOUS*. What I'm saying is- Gilbert's breakfast game is, as the kids said for about a month, on fleek. At least I think that's what they said- kids these days, I tell ya.

Anyhoo- we came here and weren't impressed. First off, when something is advertised as having \"crab\", and it ends up being \"krab\", that immediately puts a stick in my craw. If you use fake crab, then just say that it's some fake-ass crab. I got the fake-ass crab eggs benedict, which I posted a picture of. The yolk was cooked hard in my poached eggs. I'll take responsibility on my end- I should have asked if the crab was real, and I should have requested my eggs poached over easy, but I made an assumption which turned out to be wrong. Also, my potatoes were only barely warm, and my girlfriend's were piping hot, so whaddup with that? She got the biscuits and gravy, which were really just meh.

All in all, I'm sure that this place was probably the kitty's titties when it opened, and was probably good for a few years. And honestly, it might still be the best option in the area. But if you just drive a few exits east on the 60, you'll find a *SLEW* of better options."}
{"text":"I love brunch. I love protein. This wonderful restaurant has eggs galore! The omelets are delicious. So are the potatoes. My last experience with a brunch omelette was not very pleasant (at Original Pancake House), so getting an omelette at TC Eggington's more than made up for it. I love eggs again thanks to TC! 

The decor can be described as quaint country. It was cute! The service was good. I was there on Friday for lunch, so it wasn't too crowded. It seems pretty popular with the elderly (I think there's a Leisure World nearby)."}
{"text":"This reminded me of a place back home in California. My bf yelped it and we grabbed breakfast before going to a local arts festival. There was no wait for a Sunday morning, which I was surprised about. But they handle their crowd very well. I had the french toast with a side of eggs and sausage, and the mr had an omelet, all of which were really good. Our server was super sweet and we didn't feel rushed or imposed upon. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Unique little place with its own character that's is always pleasant whether you come in for breakfast, brunch, or lunch!!  This place has maintained its own little niche in the part of Chandler and has a very homie decor and the staff is extremely friendly. 
 
First, I love how you can call in ahead of time to place your name on the list. Then they have free coffee while you wait for your table.  

The Eggs Benedict are excellent always simple, but very well executed. They offer plenty of healthy options ranging from oatmeal to egg whites.  

My latest visit I ordered the English Toast with a French Flair and again they were very good."}
{"text":"Was first timer, had great service. The food was very flavorful and fresh. Will be coming back more often!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. It's now our breakfast spot on our Father Daughter Annual Golf Trip."}
{"text":"We go there for special occasions. Great food. Today we had out of town guests and were enjoying our time with them. Had a great meal and we were reminiscing.  I do not remember seeing this gentlemen before but he came over and gave a subtle hint that since we were finished we should leave. Felt uncomfortable and rushed. First time this has happened here. Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"If you ever want to go to one of those places you want go back to,this is the place.Between the food and the wholesome wait staff  this is a gem.been going here for ten years and things have always been top notch..give it a try if your in Mesa.."}
{"text":"The O'Pear Grenache Omelette is awesome! Love the combination of pear, Havarti and bacon. Always get great food and service here!"}
{"text":"Always great food & service. My go-to spot whenever I don't know what I really wanna eat. Anything with eggs Benedict is good. Biscuits & gravy were delicious here as well. If you haven't tried this place out yet then you're missing out! Don't forget the English muffins with jam!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the review hype is about?? 

They advertise on there menu how fresh juice is squeezed daily, and when asked the waitress if the juice is make on she site, she looked embarrassed and said NO!  
I do like it when places try to mis lead the public! 

The food is nothing special!!


Won't be back!"}
{"text":"I want to start off saying the food was great and would still recommend. However, this was my first trip here and I was very disappointed by the service. I'm a former server and understand how difficult it can be but I cannot allow certain mishaps. The water carafe at the table was never refilled, I had to find a hostess to get it refilled. Our waitress passed the table multiple times and didn't acknowledge us, choosing instead to focus on friends / regulars. While we asked for extra time to review the menu we sat for about 6-8 minutes after deciding our order. In addition my wife likes to order our 5 year old's food initially and our waitress didn't give her the chance. Most disappointing was the disparity between the majority of yelp reviews we read before choosing."}
{"text":"Server was super sweet.  The manager (maybe owner) politely checked on my satisfaction.  My omelet was great and the decor was nicer than I expected.  What else do you want?"}
{"text":"This is my least favorite sit-down breakfast place in the area (behind Crackers and Mimi's) because:
* There's always a wait.
* I always feel under--dressed. (The clientèle appears to be the country club crowd).
* They have communal jam containers on the tables. I wonder how many kids have licked that spoon?

My biggest problem with the place, however, is the waitstaff. The hiring manager apparently has a thing for 120-lb, tanned, 5'8\" long-haired 23-year-olds, because that's all you'll see here. It's the Stepford waitstaff. Not a career waitress in the place, which means the service is ok but not great. And it's very, very creepy.

The food, cleanliness, parking and all the rest are fine. But if you want to feel comfortable as you eat, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place was OK. I couldn't really decide between three stars and four stars because what kept them from four stars are, admittedly, snobby reasons on my part. But nonetheless, those were the things that came flooding back to me when I sat down to write this review so I'll break it down:

Food- I'll give credit where credit is due, the food was pretty good. I ordered the huevos con chorizo which was tasty minus the fact that the salsa they used I'm pretty sure was good ole' Pace (which I hate) but that's my only gripe about the food. I have to say, their mimosa's had the perfect ratio of champagne to orange juice. My friend ordered the egg's benedict and holy crap that sauce was amazing! I'd recommend that over what I ordered. 

Service- The wait staff was really attentive and friendly but not annoying which I appreciated. The only thing that bothered me (and yes- I am fully aware at how petty this is) the poor girls that worked there had a uniform of the most hideous shorts I've seen in awhile! Like seriously that's what sticks out most in my mind from eating here! Haha I'm sure that's not what the owners had in mind. We're talking like Laura Dern in Jurassic Park shorts- pleated, khaki, Bermuda's. YUCK! 

Atmosphere- Along the same lines of those treacherous shorts, the place just looks like it hasn't been updated since the 1990s. Again, I don't like the idea of being \"that gal\" who gives a restaurant 3 stars because of the decor/visual experience but at the same time, if they stepped it up just a little bit, they'd be (dare I say it) super Yelpy. Don't get me wrong, they don't have to be trendy like RNR they can still stay cutesy just a bit more modern...honestly, if they just got rid of those horrible shorts, they'd be halfway there. I guess my empathy for the poor ladies that have to sport those ugly things gets in the way of giving this place the rating it probably deserves."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with the boyfriend and the place was packed. Lots of parking in the plaza and people standing outside to be seated. We arrived and put our names down and got seated within ten minutes - not bad. I ordered green tea with my Farmers Market Eggs Ben E. dict and my boyfriend had the crab stuffed pastry, which is essentially crab inside the Benedict. We were a disappointed by the imitation crab used for the Benedict but really enjoyed the rest of the meal. My farmers market Benedict came with spinach and tomatoes that tasted really fresh. The Hollandaise sauce was also very tasty with my eggs - not too salty like most places. Waitress was nice and quick with us. Family owned and operated which is nice too. They have a wide variety of dishes here, so definitely want to return and try other things next time :) meal came out to be around $30 with tips and tax for the two of us."}
{"text":"Took my family here while in town for a couple days. They have a variety of different breakfast plates. Eat outside of the box and try something new."}
{"text":"We love this place! Never dissatisfied with a meal. It has an old, country feel. Great service and amazing breakfast!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today because I wanted to treat myself to a nice breakfast at a different spot then usual.  I've known about TC's before, but never bothered to go in, until now.

I really liked it here.  It kind of had a country/midwestern feel, with a large amount of seating and a really nice staff.  I was greeted and seated immediately, and the place was packed!  I kept it simple and went with the eggs over medium, potatos and toast, along with some coffee and water.  The service was great, and all the staff was friendly and helpful.   Food was tasty, and prices were good.

I would gladly return in the future, and most likely bring my mom here next time shes in town.  Great little place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Best french toast ever! This place is always busy and there is a reason, the food is great! I have been coming here for probably about 5 years now and can't believe I have never written a review! I love the atmosphere, fun, quirky and good service all the time even though it is always full. Some of the same people have been working here for as long as I can remember so they must be a good place to work as well because staff just doesn't stay like that. My daughter loves their omelets, my friend and her daughter loved the sandwiches. We never have a complaint and any time someone wants breakfast this is where I suggest."}
{"text":"TC Eggington's is, in my opinion, the best place for brunch in the east valley.  The farmhouse decor was recently updated and looks refreshed and cute.  The food is the star, with delicious omelets, pastries, griddle cakes, smoothies, fruit cups and coffee.   Sandwiches and salads for lunch are freshly made and very good.  The service is attentive and polite.  Our family has been going to TC's since it first opened many years ago and it remains one of our favorite places to eat, having stood the test of time."}
{"text":"T.C. Eggington I heard had a great reputation so I decided to attend with my hiking group.  

We came real early so it was pretty quiet plus only a few regulars.  The place itself is very old fashion and homey.  We ordered our coffees and drinks then started with the food.  I went plain jane with scrambled eggs, bacon, and potatoes, while my buddy ordered some pancakes.  

I didn't think it was anything special truthfully.  Eggbeater eggs, bacon was okay, and the potatoes where definitely not freshly cut.  The pancake was huge, but real dry because the thickness of it made it hard to swallow!  

Overall, I think the place is cute, but need to revamp some of the menu items to attract a more vibrant crowd.  I worked at mom/pop places like these before and we've always attract the same people in and out.  They can't always keep coming and eventually you have to reinvent. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! Waitstaff was excellent. Good came quickly after ordering. Will be back on our next trip to Arizona!"}
{"text":"Mediocre breakfast. 

We were in the neighborhood and STAHHHRVING so we yelped away and found T.C. Eggington's. Awww what a cute name. And such cute decor. I simply must know where the waitresses got those high waisted pleated khaki shorts. Anyway.

I ordered two eggs over easy with bacon, english muffin and fruit and he ordered the strawberry pancakes. 

My food was just not very hot, the bacon was super greasy and the muffin was cold with only a kiss of butter. It ate it all after covering it in Cholula (which makes anything good) and it was fine.

The strawberries on his pancakes had clearly been frozen and there was no sauce to speak of. It was all topped with about a liter of whipped cream making the whole thing more like dessert than breakfast. 

Overall, the service was good, but the food came out slowly and wasn't worth the wait. 

I would not return."}
{"text":"I saw this place on Yelp, after my girlfriend instructed me to find a brunch place with mimosas. This was the first, highest rated place I saw, so I told her we were going. 

We showed up and they were super busy. I suggest making reservations if you come on a Sunday morning. The manager took my name down, and my GF and I waited for about 35 minutes. Spoiler alert: so worth the wait!

The service was great, and despite it being very busy, our waitress was attentive to our needs. I ordered a side of pumpkin pancakes with my Little Piggy Omelette. It was delicious!!! Sooo well made.  My GF had a simple breakfast of eggs, English muffin, and potatoes. Her was delicious too!!

Overall, this place is top notch, and I am glad we went here."}
{"text":"My newly relocated friend had heard this was an excellent brunch spot so we met up here around 10am. I had the French Toast Foster which is the English Toast with bananas and a brown butter syrup. The toast was super thick and delicious, I also ordered 2 over medium eggs on the side which were cooked perfectly.

My friend on the other hand was disappointed in her pear and havarti omelette. She is a vegetarian and requested the dish without the bacon. Perhaps the bacon was the missing ingredient because she said there wasn't anything special about the omelette with a skimpy portion of pear, and a slice of cheese paper included."}
{"text":"Eggingtons is a place with good breakfast food and a weird dress code for the staff. All the Devore feels old world England and the waitresses are all wearing what seems to be safari kaki shorts with polos. Back to the food, wonderful omelets. I recommend the havarti and pear omelet. Great combination."}
{"text":"T. C. Eggington's.  We found this place with my iPhone one morning while looking for brunch.  The ratings were good, so we decided to give them a try.

We walked in and had kind of a U. S. Egg experience: no sooner did we enter than FIVE consistently dressed and made-up women (some in shorts, some with blond hair, and ALL in pink-dominated pastels) turned their heads to greet us in a Stepford fashion.  One led us to a table in the back of the restaurant.  The surreal combination of this, menus with chicken wire inset into them, a long table next to us filled with 60-plus diners, and \"Like a Fool Believes\" playing over the restaurant speakers had me in a fit of uncontrollable laughter.

The menu was so full of puns like \"hens forth\", and \"egg cetera\" that I was almost too distracted to order my food.  However, I did settle on a stack of pancakes and sharing an order of french toast with my wife.

Frankly, I thought they only served pancakes THIS BIG at truck stops out around Kingman.  These things are gigantic.  Taste?  Best I've had in a restaurant--and I've had lots of pancakes in restaurants.  Order a stack here, and you'll have enough breakfast for two to three days afterwards--getting your money's worth is always a good thing.  Same for the French Toast--big portions, WOW taste.

This is the place you bring visitors from out of town when you want  to take them to have breakfast or brunch out.  The next morning, you can have breakfast or brunch IN, with the same food.

T. C. Eggington's is the ultimate breakfast joint in the Valley.  Go.  Just. . .go."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday brunch with the family one summer day =]

Keeping it short and simple

- located a little past the freeway entry. easy to miss so keep a look out for it once you get off. Its located on the corner of a plaza.
- Huge parking lot for the entire plaza. When we got there, we managed to find parking within the first 5 minutes which was fast considering how many cars there were.
- Has a very home like atmosphere, lots of round tables and smaller tables for big or small parties. 
- one of those places where everything on the menu sounds good and LOOKS good (we kept turning our heads whenever someone brought food out to a table. EVERYTHING LOOKED AND SMELT so deliciousss
- We were all satisfied with our meals. Full and happy by the end of it. 
- Service was friendly and overall experience put us all in high spirits. Can't remember exactly what we all ordered but note, it definitely was super savory."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in the valley, hands down.

We book a reservation for 8:45 am on Mother's Day and get right in (yay!).

Employees are extremely friendly,personable, and accommodating. Checked up on us just the right amount. 

It was my family of 4 that dined in. We ordered Hot Mama (a tad spicy which I like), she had Eggs Benedict, my son had Blueberry Hill (Pancakes), and we also had my baby, who didn't order :)

The orange juice is delicious, and also the hot chocolate (I know it's summertime in Phoenix!).

The food is unbelievable, worth what they are asking. Our bill was $38.

They are also very active on social media with their FB fan page and Twitter, which appeals to me.

I GUARANTEE you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Birthday breakfast great place, the piglet's passion omelet is the best that it can get..filled with everyone's first love... meat, and the potatoes are perfectly cooked. You got to get there."}
{"text":"I have been sitting here for about 5 minutes, have not gotten my food yet but absolutely love the place. The employees are so nice and the atmosphere is amazing. It is a must try!!!!!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

This place is fine.  Down-homey.  The best part I found was that they did not overcook the veggies in the egg dishes, left some crunch on them.  Their chorizo is ok, their omelettes were not totally overcooked either.

Wife got the Western Union-Jack, basically a Denver omelette with ham, cheese, onion, and pepper.  Comes with an English muffin and choice of side - she chose fruit.  The omelette was average-sized, tasted fine.  A little heavy on the cheese actually.  I ordered the Percival's Hot Pad, basically a breakfast burro without the beans.  Has chorizo, egg, onions, and jalapeno.  Covered in cheese and salsa.  I preferred this dish to my wife's (mostly because of the jalapenos), though the side it came with was pretty weak - basically some chopped vegetables that would normally go into another omelette, covered in salsa. 

Based on the quality of the food, 3 stars works.  We had no big complaints.  We don't think we'd go out of our way to come here though.  Value is a little issue.  Most everything on the menu is around $10 and you can get equally good food, if not better, for cheaper around the Valley.  They give you a whole carafe of coffee, but that's $3.  For sub-par coffee.  

So if you're in the area, a decent neighborhood joint.  I wouldn't call it a destination breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Yummy.  Happening place for lunch on Sundays, but usually short to no actual wait in getting a table.  Strawberry pancakes are tasty, but the omelettes are the real draw.  Classy without pretension."}
{"text":"Worth our 45 minute drive to come here- food, service, patio ambience ...all fantastic"}
{"text":"The place was busy. We were greeted promptly at the door by our server and brought directly to our table. Coffee and drinks were delivered quickly, and our order was taken. The food was good, but the place was loud. Our server was on refills and even asked if we wanted a Diet to-go. The is no Sugar in the Raw, but the coffee is served in a nice carafe. Our server suggested the Honey Wheat-germ Pancakes. They were good, but way too much wheat-germ. The bacon was super greasy, so greasy that I had to pat the grease off with a spare napkin. The Chorizo-Frittata was good, but not at all spicy. The Home-Fries were ordinary and best. This was my first time to the place, I would go back if in the area, but would not make this a destination."}
{"text":"I had the egg white omelet & it was really good!
We sat on the patio on a Sunday & the atmosphere is awesome!
The service is great as well!
I will be back!"}
{"text":"First off, Joseph and Steven were such amazing workers. They made us feel so welcomed and put smiles on our faces. This restaurant was recommended to me by a friend because he knew how much I loved a Ncounter and apparently it's the parent company! I got the huevo con chorizo and it was delicious! The apple cinnamon jam is amazing you need to get the butter and English muffins and put the Jam on it!!! Everything was amazing this is a must visit!"}
{"text":"This is a cute place to grab some breakfast with the family. The service is excellent. There is a great variety of breakfast options. The prices are also very reasonable for the amount of food you get. The best part is the apple butter jam. It is amazing. I wanted to eat it right out of the jar. The rest of the food is good, but not exceptional. Overall, it is a good place to go for a reasonable breakfast, just don't expect anything amazing."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has such a good rating really. I felt awkward as soon as I walked in... Wait staff in high wasted khaki shorts and an attempt at decor you'd find at your grandmas. Maybe that's why it attracts the older crowd?

Food was not good. I got the crab stuffed pastry. It was not a pastry. It was a croissant - like the ones you can buy at Fry's in those plastic containers (it wasn't stuffed either ha). It also wasn't crab... It was imitation crab. The artichoke tasted canned. Side of bacon was really greasy. They had these big plastic containers of tea and water on the table so we didn't have to wait for refills, but they looked really old and were stained with water spots and grime from use. Not appetizing. 

The waitress started out good. But then towards the end was chatting it up with some kid from another party and took FOREVER to bring our check or even notice we were done. 

2 stars because the waitress was nice and warned me that if I ordered the egg how they had it in the menu it would be really runny."}
{"text":"Another egg-citing way to start off a Monday Morning! Still on a Monday Morning, this place does have a good amount of people. I was craving eggs benedict and ordered their Crab Eggs Benedict. I love this place; it still reminds me of Sunday brunch with the plaid table cloth. Their eggs benedict is large in size. But is it as delicious as the last time? Ah, no it is not. After eating one of the best eggs benedict in New Orleans with real crab, I now see this place as A-OK. It is still very cute and I like the environment. 3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Food is always good but service is getting worse and worse. Took us 30 min to order and another 45 min to get our breakfast! I know they are popular but the last few times it's just been slow. I recommend them for unique and yummy food but don't go if you don't have plenty o time."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast burrito and a slice of French Toast.
Burrito was pretty typical except the sauce is very good and makes it all work.
The French Toast was really good.  Not sure if they have real Maple syrup but it doesn't come standard.
Coffee was really disappointing, you pay 2.65 for McDonalds quality coffee.  I drink mine black so the quality really makes a difference to me and I really dislike paying a premium price mediocre coffee.  That was my only disappointment.
Service was great."}
{"text":"We went for Easter brunch and they said it would be 30 minutes to be seated and it actually only took like 7 minutes.  The coffee was delicious.  Service and food were amazing!"}
{"text":"I don't know how I have never written a review for TC's. I have been coming here for 15 years and it is by far my favorite breakfast place! The wheat germ pancakes, eggs benedict, Saturday's biscuits and gravy, and the passion fruit iced tea are just fantastic. It gets so busy after 9am, so if you can't wait for the deliciousness then I wouldn't come here.Oh, but it is worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"We were visiting from Washington State and stopped here for breakfast. Everything was delicious from the pancakes, to the omelettes, to the fresh squeezed orange juice. Portion sizes are huge so come hungry. Everyone had on Polo shirts with cute socks Our servers name was Kelly. She was very attentive even with the place packed. We will definitely come again whenever we are in the area. Thank you so much for a wonderful breakfast with my family"}
{"text":"Excellent quality food all around and a friendly eager to please staff make for one of the better breakfast experiences in Mesa. The decor here is a little old fashioned - kinda feels like having breakfast in Kansas :)"}
{"text":"Never been here before. I loved it. The breakfast was superb. Something as simple as eggs, sausage, potatoes and an English muffin. Not everyone can prepare an over medium egg correctly and they nailed it. I will come back for the eggs. How crazy is that."}
{"text":"Out of this world French Toast. Did I make myself clear, the French Toast is TO DIE FOR!!

I finally convinced, no really tricked my partner into coming here. By the time we decide we want breakfast on the weekends we're usually starving and a trip from Scottsdale to Mesa to wait in line for breakfast is just not in the cards.

Well, today we planned a road trip and T.C. Eggington's was on the way, I am so happy it was. The service, other than on minor point was the absolute best and the food was great. I ordered the French Toast based on what I had read about this place and my partner ordered Pancakes. While both took a little longer than I would have wanted they were GREAT. The server was extremely friendly, just like everyone at the restaurant. Combine that with great food and it makes up for the food coming a little slower than I would have liked.

If you're in Mesa and want a great breakfast this is the place to come! You have to check it out...and order the French Toast. Take my word for it."}
{"text":"Love the cinnamon French Toast. It's melt in your mouth delicious! Morning can get very busy, especially on the weekend. Restaurant is clean, prices are reasonable and staff is accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"Finally after 20 some odd years, I am finally eating here . . . though not for breakfast, but for a light business lunch.

We were seated quickly, and our drink order taken . . . shortly after our drinks arrived, our wiatress returned to tak our order . . . I ordred the Balsamic Florentine Chicken Grille Sandwich.

The sandwich arrived in a reasonable amount of time . . . and was unbelievable.  The chicken was hot and moist . . . the mushroooms with the balsamic dressing were sweet and tasty . . . the cibatta roll was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.  The black bean side salad was also good . . . the problem was I wanted to finish my whole sandwich . . . so I did have some salad left over.

The reason for the loss of a star was simple . . . our waitress did stop back and check on us once, but since we were there for over an hour . . . I would have light to have had somewon from the restaurant check back with us.

Return trip . . . Most Definitely . . ."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in Arizona.  The service is amazing, the food is amazing!  You must try this restaurant.  It is a little outdated with the decor and uniforms the staff wears but don't let that fool you.  Wonderful place to eat!!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I fly hear in the Phoenix area for business or pleasure I always try and make it to T.C. Eggingtons's. They never let me down."}
{"text":"Dont bother trying to make a reservation because wether it is a party of 5 or party of 13 staff will still make you wait until your actually in the restaurant to try and find a table for you. Every single time I come in the tables, floors, chairs, walls, bathrooms, and condiments on the table are disgusting and filled with left over food. The waiters and waitresses all seem very unhappy with there job and lack any type of social or basic customer service skills. Always have to repeat simple orders back to waiter 3 times and have to beg to get water glasses refilled. The food is goos but it really stinks that everything sucks so bad I never want to go back."}
{"text":"Not all that impressed. Very very slow service. Their crab pastry with Holliday sauce was very bland. Took a couple of bite and I just couldn't. My bf got the French toast with bacon he loved what he got. My friend or a burro she enjoyed it except the extremely hard cheese that was on top that she couldn't eat. 
Don't think that we will be back any time soon."}
{"text":"The service is very good snd the food is OK.  You need to be an egg person to really appreciate the place but if you eat at a place with this name you gotta expect eggs. Get coffee & you get a pitcher, which I like.  They have so many varied & interesting combinations just trying one of them is worth the visit.  They have a small 5-table outdoor patio but you can call ahead & reserve a seat outside.  That can be 8 or 9 months of the year in this climate.  If you are in the area for breakfast or lunch it is good stuff with fresh food & reasonable prices"}
{"text":"I have been eating at TC Eggington's since I was a kid. They have never disappointed me. The menu is diverse and the food is absolutely delicious!
I had the Greek Fetash omelet with English muffin, potatoes and cottage cheese.  The coffee is always good. 
They have updated the restaurant in small ways, but it still reminds me of my childhood. The servers still have the same standard uniform of a pastel polo shirt, tan shorts and penny loafer shoes. 
If there is a wait (there usually is), do yourself a favor and stay. It is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Can I Say One of the Best Breakfast Spots in Greater Phoenix/Mesa Area! Worth the Wait or Come Back Later,  But Come Back!  The \"EGGINGTON OMELETTE\"  IS TO LIVE FOR, ANOTHER DAY! So You Could Order It Again! FOOL! Their Service is On Par and Impeccable. Everything is Fresh,  Except their Servers. Ooops, I Think I Made a Funny! ;-)"}
{"text":"We love this place and have for over 10 years of every other weekend breakfast excursions. The Crab Stuffed Pasty, the Crack o'dawn and the Eggington Omelet are my favorites!  Don't skimp on the Hollandaise!  They have the best recipe ever!

The only complaint I would have is a year or so ago, Thom hired on some management help for hostessing/seating (as he should have!) and the man working there is not a pleasant person to deal with.  In addition to being abrupt and downright rude, he clearly does not enjoy the job or the opportunity Thom offered.  We do our best to avoid TC Eggington's during this man's working hours and would much prefer the atmosphere when Thom is present.  Even the wait staff are more relaxed when this man is not present."}
{"text":"We had our Ladies' Luncheon there today.  25 women.   Service, food, EVERYTHING was excellent.   Management, Thom,  was hugely helpful in the planning of the event.   Ivars was hosting.  He welcomed us and kept us informed as to when we would be seated.  He went above and beyond...thank you, Ivars.  Michael and Brandie (Brandy?) were our servers and did a FANTASTIC job.   We could not have asked for a better experience.  Many thanks."}
{"text":"This is my most favorite Breakfast spot.  We went here on Sunday, and we got there at approx 11am, the hostess guy said we had a 15 minute wait and we walked around and when we came back they already had called our name, so they got us right in.   
We ordered a Egg White ham and cheese omelet, with olives, bell peppers, and blacks olives (not overly greasy) and the portions are so large they were able to split one serving into two, with a serving of home fries, and English muffin, coffee and a cup of steel oats with brown sugar and raisins for each of us, and all this for under $25.00.
I would really recommend this place if you have out of town guest,  it would be a great treat to take them here, and not bad on the wallet.
The staff is phenomenal, and the decor is french country, it's cute."}
{"text":"Never had anything bad here! All of the omlets are great, my friends and I call the wheat germ pancakes \"crack pancakes\". Get there early if you are going on a weekend. Sundays at 10 are a bad time to go because this place will be hoping. 
The service is very stepford like, but the food can't be beat."}
{"text":"This is a really good breakfast if you're looking for something family oriented.  I've been both during the week and on the weekends and during the week there's no line in on the weekends its packed but the food is still good the old man is a bit of a grouch though you'll know who I'm talking about when you see him just don't get in his way cuz he'll bark at you. but the food is really good and the other servers are really nice. I would have given this place 5 stars if the Groucho didn't work there."}
{"text":"Food is good. Coffee is too weak and tastes like a lot of water added to it. They charge you if they add a shot to make it taste like regular coffee."}
{"text":"Wow can't say enough! The food was great and very large portions. Different selections to choose from. The wait was long but very much worth it. We tried the crab and artichoke stuffed pastry and the apple pancakes and the O'pear omelet yum yum yum to all three. The staff was very attentive even though it was packed!"}
{"text":"Food is really good but restaurant lacks consistency. Many times I will have nearly nothing in my omelet or the potatoes will be soggy. Biggest gripe is the new way they handle call ahead list.  Question:WHY have a call ahead list if you are going to make me wait 15-20 min past my time every time?  I show up on time but wait just as long as if I just showed up normally without calling ahead. Again another example of inconsistency delivered by them. Don't know why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Breakfast here is always good, that's why there's a wait on weekends. I've enjoyed a couple of different omelets and Ada G. always gets the pig and cow omelet (or something like that, I never remember the name). It's her favorite. I'm a little ticked off still, and it's been about five hours since we left the restaurant, because I feel like we were nickel and dimed and that's one of the things I hate most. Like when you ask you a little extra sour cream and they charge you $2.50 (and you're eating a $5.00 burrito). They didn't do that, but we ordered milk for our kids, she has a four year old and I have the toddler of course. No, I take it back. The waiter specifically asked if we wanted anything to drink for the kids so we ordered some milk for them. The milk he brought came in styrofoam cups with lids. Pretty common if a restaurant doesn't have kids cups and they usually only have one size of styrofoam cups so they bring your drink in those. The kids of course each drank about a third of their gargantuan cups of milk and had enough. When the bill came (and unfortunately after we paid) I noticed that the waiter charged us for large milks. These aren't two lumber jacks. The toddler even still sits in a high chair. Why would either of them need 24 ounces of milk? Deep breathe. Let it go. It just seemed kind of jerky.

The food is good, all the omelets at least, I haven't got past them. If you go on a Saturday morning, beware of a little wait. It is a popular place. If you're not up for a huge meal, the portions are large enough to split. Ada G. and I probably would have but I wasn't in the mood for her snout and hoof omelet. Maybe next time. By the way, the Spanish omelet is great!"}
{"text":"For breakfast on a Sunday afternoon, I don' think it gets much better than this. Food prepared with excellence, friendly staff and owners, with fresh unique, delicious dishes to try. Newly remodeled dinning area helps as well. Must tries include, French toast, bran muffin, Eggington omlette, actually just about anything you order is goingto be great."}
{"text":"Good service. A little pricey but the mimosas make up for it. Warning LOTS OF PULP. - Went through half a dozen times, each time was decent. The only thing is with the pancakes, ask for extra butter on the side, they are super dry but tasty if you have extra butter. 

On Sunday, you will have a wait. - Good for kids. Polite and professional staff."}
{"text":"This place is super cute! It has the feel of a country breakfast place with themed pastel colored decorations. It reminds me a bit of Easter! i came for Sunday brunch and man! there were a lot of people. Even still we were seated quickly and service was quick and friendly. 

I ordered the crab benedict because it combines 2 of my loves. :) We did wait a little while for the food to come out but for how busy they were I can understand. Instead of an english muffin it came with a flaky type of biscuit which was okay. It wasn't flaky and crispy as I would imagine but more flaky and packed together. In the center was the crab which I think was imitation. It tasted alright overall. It was still yummy but I wasn't head over heels in love with it. Maybe something else on the menu would appeal more to me. :) 

Overall, I thought the food was good not great but the service and ambiance makes up for it. It is on the pricier side for breakfast but not crazy expensive. Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"I have been there several times with girlfriends and always brag about it. Hubby and daughter were always super jealous. So... Today being the first day of Spring Break I decided they needed a special surprise!! I made reservations (not required but HIGHLY RECOMMEND because they are always packed).  We were seated right away and instantly you are comfortable in the country cozy decor.  I always get the same thing because when you have the best why switch? I am talking about the Farmer's Market Ben E Dict! Poached eggs with hollandaise check... But add spinach, tomato and Avocado... Yes please!! Absolutely delicious every time. My girlie girl got the same and was not disappointed with my recommendation. Hubby got the Cottage Reef omelet with crabmeat, artichoke hearts, cream cheese and hollandaise.... He cleaned his plate!  I have to admit that a small part of me wants to break out of my rut and go for the English toast with a French flair. Looks like we will be going back again and again!  Stay tuned for more :)"}
{"text":"We went here on Sunday for Mother's Day. If you go out on this day it's a given that it's going to be busy. So I will not be judging service too hard. For the most part our service was great, waitress forgot a few things and we had to ask a few times but I'm sure she was under a lot of pressure with the place being so busy. I ordered the eggs Benedict and substituted my potatoes for a Pancakes for $1.00 more. We had ordered iced tea and when you do this they bring a carafe full of tea that way you can help yourself to more, I loved this, especially considering how busy it was. The eggs Benedict had a very delicious hollandaise sauce, I had no complaints with my meal it was delicious. I will return here again :)"}
{"text":"T. C. Eggington's is one of the best places in the valley to eat breakfast or lunch.  Service is always quick and the food is fresh and tasty.  You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Amazing Food and Even Better Service!  I meet here with my business networking group and they always take care of us!  I love their Strawberry Banana Smoothies!!  Delish!"}
{"text":"My parents were in town for Thanksgiving, and after church I turned to the Yelp app to find a good Breakfast/Brunch spot. 

T.C. Eggington's showed up right away - - and it's been a long time since I've been here (like 10 yrs sadly). So why not try it again? I knew that there definitely was going to be a wait for the after-church crowd... but oh well, we'll be patient. 

I was pleasantly surprised that there was immediate seating for our party of 4 on the small patio. 

Menus were served to us right away, with a carafe of water and coffee. But the menus were pretty cute -- actually had chicken wire in the menus. 

But on to the food -- all 4 of us had a real hard time deciding what we wanted, since everything sounded delicious! I was craving a French Toast combo type of plate... (which they didn't have). So I ended up choosing the O'Pear Grenache Omelette. 

Very good..... Bosc pears, Havarti cheese, sliced almonds, and Bacon. English muffin and cottage cheese on the side. Delish!

Other entrees at our table: eggs bene, Greek Fetash omelette, and the Phinnaes Cobb sandwich. 

We all enjoyed, and we're all still pleasantly full! 

Oh, and nice touch at the end -- the server asked if any of us wanted coffee-to-go. I did, and he arrived back with a large cup to go complimentary. Nice... 

This was the perfect place to bring my parents for Sunday breakfast, for after church at St. Tim's in Mesa."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot, by far! You can't go wrong with anything you order, but my favorites are their eggs benedict, their english harvest omelet and their breakfast salad. It's a good family restaurant, but if you are bringing a group on a weekend morning, call ahead so you don't have a long wait! The staff is always great, and usually the owner is there, seating guests himself! 

Tip: You can order reduced portions of their omelets and a half order of the breakfast salad!"}
{"text":"So I was looking through yelp to find a place for breakfast with the BF this morning, and came across this place which is really close to where I live. I was excited to try somewhere new and I checked out their website. So on the website it says you can call ahead to put your name on the list, so we decided to do that. They asked what time we wanted to come in and we said in a half hour and they said fine. So, we hung out a bit longer and after about 20 min, we headed over. Well, apparently putting your name on the list over the phone does nothing , because we still got seated after everyone who was waiting when we got there. So we were a little irked, cuz why say you can call when calling does nothing? Oh well. So we are seated and we got some coffee, which was decent, and I ordered the O'pear omelet and the BF got pancakes and a side english muffin. So, I think he would have appreciated some warning that the pancakes are ginormous and there would be no need for extra bread.... no such luck.... but oh well. My omelet was good, it was really different. It had pears, almonds, and havarti (and it usually has bacon, but I'm not a fan so I had them hold it). It was good tasting... I liked the sweet and savory combination. It came with home fries which were very tasty (some yummy seasoning on them) and an english muffin with some kind of cinnamon apple jam.... anyway it was all good. The BF was not a huge fan of the pancakes as they were kind of bland and way too large.

Overall, this place seems to have good food but there are some down sides which include: not many non egg options (BF is allergic to eggs), the pancakes were meh, and the call ahead didn't really work out. I really enjoyed my food, though, so still an overall positive review. 

Oh, and I think their decor is kind of weird.... and the uniforms are also odd.... loafers? khaki shorts? polos? hmmmm. I don't know what that has to do with breakfast, but ok....."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on yelp, I cannot begin to say how very good the food was. I had the crab stuffed in a pastry with artichoke and hollandaise sauce and a poached egg. It was truly one of the most wonderful things I have had to eat in recent memory. The parlour potatoes were also excellent. Brandi my server could not have been sweeter and so attentive. I highly recommend TC Eggington's."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch a few days ago and everything on the menu looked so amazing. Or maybe it was the fact that I was starving. Lol. 

I ordered the Eggington omelette. I saw cream cheese in it and was like done. I have to get it. My friend ordered the crab stuffed pastry. I enjoyed my omelette. It was a very good size and it came with their rich hollandaise sauce that was sooooo delicious. It was very filling though. My friend didn't enjoy her meal much since she felt that it was a bit pricey for imitation crab. 

They have mimosas here for $5! It was ok but probably would've been better with fresh squeezed oj instead. 

The wait was ok. Around 20 minutes ish on a Sunday around noon. I'd come back for brunch if I was in the area. =)"}
{"text":"I had the Union Jack omelette, I was worried at first that it might be smothered with cheese but It actually came out quite nice.

The only down side to this place was the seating. We got placed in this corner sweet next to a plant that blocked a lot of the view we had."}
{"text":"Homemade food made with Fresh ingredients. They have healthy options and gluten free menu. I took my boyfriend there for his birthday breakfast and he loved everything. I really enjoy the feel of this place. I want to go back there soon"}
{"text":"This morning my wife, her nephew, and I went for breakfast at T.C. Eggington's.  We kind of knew it would be standard American fare for breakfast.  We were actually surprised, in a very pleasant way.  The food was good.

Duong (my wife) had the Greek Fetash Omelet, and she said it was good.  It was not overly greasy and did not seem heavy.  Tam (my wife's nephew) had the original egg's benedict.  He is from Vietnam, but likes particularly runny eggs.  He said it was good.  Me, I had the crab pastry, which is effectively a version of an egg's benedict (just had pastry instead of muffin, and has crab instead of Canadian bacon).  It was good.  It was not salty.

Overall, I would say that this restaurant is actually quite good.  You can not go in there expecting the latest fancy thing for breakfast.  However, if you are looking for a good selection of breakfast choices, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"For decades we have been enjoying the Cottage Reef at T.C. Eggington's.  Since we are light eaters, one split order is enough for us both. The food, service and value is great!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I forgot how much I loved it until I went with my grandma over the weekend. AMAZING food and great service. I wish I had more reasons to go to mesa so I could eat here more often."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Didnt give 5 stars due to a bug in my water, ewwww and our server was nice but non-apparent. Will come again!"}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice now, and it fails to hit the mark.  Everyone else in my party has been happy both times.  However, I seem to be cursed here.  Whatever I order is always loaded with onions.  I absolutely HATE onions, and I avoid ordering anything that contains onions.  Last time I ate here, I asked for no onions in an omelet ith brie cheese that I was pretty excited about, and they left 'em in there.  I was too cowardly to demand that it be returned to the kitchen, I so I just didn't eat it.  Today, I ordered a sandwich which mentioned nothing about onions, and they were all over my food.  Yuck!  I ordered a muffin to mask the taste, and it did the trick.  The muffin was the only good thing I've eaten here.  However, if you like onions, you might love it!"}
{"text":"This place is overpriced and the quality of the food is mediocre. We were there around 8am on a Sunday and it was fairly empty but my husband and I were seated in the back of the restaurant. The atmosphere was very stuffy.

We ordered breakfast staples; eggs and potatoes, biscuits and gravy. The potatoes tasted as if they were poured out from a frozen bag onto a griddle and gravy had a super funky flavor. Since we were seated in the back we were able to see other orders as they left the kitchen. Many of the plates looked thrown together and unappetizing. 

As we left, there was a manager standing at the front counter watching us leave. The judgmental look on his made me feel as if he was making sure we weren't \"dining and dashing.\" I kind of wished we had. The food, the service, and overall experience wasn't worth it. Needless to say we're never going back."}
{"text":"Was beyond pleased with this great establishment. Hostess was super cheerful and seated us quickly. Restaurant very open, airy and bright. An Americana/rustic French feel to it.  Menu was ridiculously delicious to read with so many, but not overbearing, selections. We were a party of six and our waitress took great care of us with drinks, both standard and alcoholic (mimosas, bellinis and screwdrivers enjoyed by all). Coffee was terrific and pot refilled twice without asking.  

Portions were well sized but not crazy with all ingredients blended together quite well. It was a very enjoyable meal and for certain will be a stop next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Came here looking for a new place to try for a brunch date and were not disappointed.
We were seated promptly, our waiter was very friendly and quick to get our drinks.
We had fun with the menu which was easy to read and offered some nice breakfast choices.
Our waiter was attentive but did not hover. My boyfriend ordered the Eggington Omelette that came with potatoes and an English muffin and I ordered the artichoke and crab meat omelette I substituted my potatoes for fruit. We both enjoyed our meals, the hollandaise sauce was delicious!
After we got our check my boyfriend and I chatted for a little bit before we left. It was fantastic that or wonderful waiter did my try to rush us out like most restaurants do. 
Perhaps we'll come back again next time we want to do a nice breakfast date again.

Good atmosphere. 
Good service.
Great lighting."}
{"text":"This little spot can get really packed. The first time I was here there was a 20 minute wait. The 2nd time the restaurant was full, even though it was pretty late (about noon) on Sunday. 

The coffee was excellent, strong and dark, and they set the pitcher on your table so you can get really caffeinated up. :)

The food and service was great. They've got some interesting breakfast selections on the menu. I'm not into sour cream, cream cheese, or feta on my eggs but for those a little more adventurous for breakfast, I'm sure would find those selections great. 

I just ordered eggs mixed with vegetables, potatoes, and cheese in a skillet. Very tasty. I guess next time I'll take the advice of others here and order the french toast! Yum."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in town. Their English muffins and jam are out of this world. The Crack O' Dawn plate is my favorite; however, the English muffins and their homemade jams are what keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Breakfast, lunch, brunch . . . no matter what you go for, it is exquisite. The food, the service and the management/ownership is top notch. Which explains why they have been at the top of their game for 30 years plus! I so enjoy their well manicured and professional servers and the attention by the manager on duty--always pitching in to help when it is busy, which seems to be ALWAYS!  They just have so many extra touches, i.e. water carafes on the table and if you order coffee, a whole insulated pot of coffee comes to you! You can opt for different side dishes without an extra charge, nice touch. And now you can even get \"adult beverages\" to enhance your brunch! Consistency is the name of the game in the restaurant biz and TC Eggington's has nailed it for as long as I've been a patron---all 30 years!"}
{"text":"I really couldn't care for breakfast foods prior to this place. 

I've had almost everything on the menu by now. Their commitment to quality has been present in every single dish I've seen. Vegetables are always very fresh, breads are delicious, eggs cooked perfectly any style, pancakes and French toast ommmmgggggg. Dishes aren't soaked in grease like other breakfast hot spots. 

Their take out is just as amazing as it is sitting inside. I live nearby and order pick up as they tend to have a wait, which is understandable with how good this place is. 

T.C. Eggingtons just delivers the correct and fulfilling breakfast experience every time. 

TheFarmers Market Eggs Benedict is amazing!"}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast spot in Phoenix.  Try the Santa Fe Sautee, esp if you like really flavorful food with a little spice.  And their coffee is to die for."}
{"text":"my mom and i like to come here for breakfast sometimes because it's pretty equal distance from our houses in phoenix and gilbert. we have been pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food from this unassuming place in the back of a strip mall. we've tried the vegetable frittata, huevos con chorizo, strawberry griddle cakes, o'pear omelette and the crack o' dawn. all were delicious! 

The coffee and service are always superb as well. Beware the wait on weekends!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here and I'm never disappointed! Huge menu, great coffee, and delectable food! Service is a liiiittle slow, but they are always super friendly. The Crack O'Dawn is outstanding, though my eggs had me in tears laughing. They looked so shocked to be on my plate, lol. We'll most definitely be back many many times."}
{"text":"It's been about ten years since I visited and this visit was a bit of a disappointment. Your servers are truly friendly - all young smiling hostesses with great personalities. Loved that for sure. But our orders came and there were some missing items, potatoes exchanged for fruit (wanted fruit) and dry pancakes. I thought the food was a bit lacking but you cannot beat the service. Would I come back?? Maybe."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast or brunch. Very country feel. Didn't try any of the specialties, but they looked great.  Will definitely go back to try more dishes!!"}
{"text":"It takes a lot to impress me at restaurants after working in fine dining but, the service was great here! The staff was very friendly and Jake was on it. We were a party of 9 visiting from Orange County and heard good things about this place and wanted to give it a whirl. We didn't know what to expect...Not once did I have to ask for anything or wait longer than expected.  Very happy with the quality of food and service and we will definitely be back in the future. Thank you for such a great Thanksgiving weekend."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, but generic breakfast restaurant atmosphere. The french toast was amazing - two inch thick slices of bread. If you want a big hearty breakfast, this is a solid choice. Everything was good. My only complaint really was the lack of choices for potato. Eggs were perfect, bacon was tremendous and not too greasy, and english muffin was nice... muffin was a little overbuttered for my taste, but good. Breakfast is simple, but also easy to fuck up. They do a great job with it overall. 

The service was good when I went. Seated rather quickly and our server was cute and happy to please. I'm a fussy customer too, so she did really well to cope with me. 

A few random notes... Prices were a bit on the high side, but you certainly get a huge amount of food. They carry Splenda, but you have to ask for it because they don't keep it at the tables. Their coffee is average, but certainly acceptable. The sizes of their glasses are pure comedy. I ask for an OJ, and then have to select a size... I'm told sizes are 'regular,' 'large,' and 'huge' - there was a tiny glass already in front of me and that turned out to be the large. I could only imagine the shot-glass they call a regular. The huge glass is what I'd call regular. It was big enough for an OJ though.

I don't know that I'd drive out of my way considering how many awesome breakfast places are near my home, but if I was in that area I'd definitely stop there for a good hearty breakfast."}
{"text":"Lots of stuff on the menu, but nothing I found appealing.  Asked if they had biscuits and gravy...they do but only on the weekend.  Ended up with eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast.  Eggs are eggs.  Potatoes were very uninspiring.  Bacon and toast were both good.  Overall, just ok."}
{"text":"This is my mom's favorite breakfast place, so naturally we took her here in our Mother's Day celebration on Saturday.  We arrived at about 10:30 or so and as usual, the place was jam-packed and I could barely squeeze through the doors to get my name in.  We were quoted at about 20 minutes for a table of 3 and within 20 minutes we were seated.  Good, because I was starving.

There are quite a few things that appeal to me on their menu.  I am a big fan of their \"heartier\" pancakes.  You know, the kind that are loaded with nuts and berries and other healthy crap.  They are all very good.  This time I went with an omelet.  I chose the same thing as the husband did, a pear, bacon, sliced almond, and havarti creation.  I thought it sounded a little weird, but I am a sucker for bacon and havarti.  The omelet was delicious.  It was a generous portion and all of the flavors melded together beautifully.  I loved the differences in texture in every bite.  The omelet was also served with potatoes that are so-so and an english muffin.  By itself the english muffin was pretty lame, but if you add the apple cinnamon jelly that sits on the table, it's incredible.  I LOVED that jelly.  It was really really good, and I don't even like cinnamon.

The things that suck about this place are: the layout - it's very jumbled and sometimes I think the servers forget you; the servers outfits - I can't stand looking at the poor girls wearing high waisted khaki mom jeans, it's downright painful; the wait - whenever we come here, I am starving and it kills me to have to wait outside in the AZ heat.  Overall though, this is a nice place.  I enjoy coming here whenever we're out in the EV with my family."}
{"text":"The food here is good but I hate the wait.  It is really not any better than IHOP or Denny's but the families in the East Valley always have 10 members and stay for an hour once they get their table.  That's not really a knock on the restaurant but it is frustrating when you are hungry.

As far as the food goes, I guess I just don't ever see anything great looking on their menu.  Last time I had an omelet with pears and bacon.  It was okay but the flavors didn't really come together in the way I thought they would. 

Finally, I hate the decor of this place.  I hate the chickens, I hate the chicken wire on the menu, I hate their poor layout, and I hate the pace of their servers.  Ultimately, this is what drags the place down for me."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting and I want to be fair so all I can say is stay away from the Benedict. Both of my pouched eggs where over cooked (the yoke was hard, instead of creamy and runny like they should be). Also in my plate was a piece of lettuce and a slice of what it looked like Day old tomato... Atmosphere was nice, and it seemed clean."}
