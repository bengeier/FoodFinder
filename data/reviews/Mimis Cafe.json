{"text":"My son and I had the best service.  Our server was Mark.  My son has severe food allergies and they catered to this.  Mark was so kind, friendly and just overall great.  Food was amazing as well.  The manager spoke with the kitchen to ensure my sons food was prepared without cross contamination.  We will be back and will ask for you Mark!"}
{"text":"Walked out without being served.  Host never greeted me and was around the corner talking with co-workers.  Place was nearly empty on a Saturday evening.   The parking lot at Olive Garden next door was full and this place was empty.  I'm pretty sure it's due to service.
No worries - I'll never set foot in this place again."}
{"text":"Third time here in one year and we are from San Francisco!  This place is always prompt and courteous and helpful.  Did I mention the food is fantastic?!"}
{"text":"I've been to Mimi's before, but had a really nice experience at THIS Mimi's.  I took my mother in law to brunch.  We were seated by a window in a small-ish room.  We hadn't spent time with each other in a long while so we slowly ordered our eggs benedict and coffee (both excellent).  What was best was that the waitress figured out that we needed some good catch up time and while she was very attentive, we never felt rushed or like she needed to turn a table.  I've never closed down a breakfast place before but we managed to and it was just what we needed.  Relaxing and perfect."}
{"text":"Weekly brunch #4 brought my friend and me to Mimi's Cafe today.  First off, let me say it is SO cute!  It's got this French sort of theme going on, and upon walking in, you feel a little Euro flair.  It was kind of strange because there wasn't really a hostess, so people were just kind of milling around the entryway, but someone would occasionally come by and seat people, so there wasn't really a wait.  The food options are really great here, and they have a seasonal menu from which I ordered the pumpkin pancakes.  I recommend.  They come topped with caramelized cinnamon apples.  My friend got the blueberry stuffed French toast, which is French toast stuffed with blueberry cream cheese and topped with some other fruit stuff, and he said it was really good, too.  Per tradition, my friend also ordered a side of potatoes, and what we liked about these potatoes was that they weren't hashed.  They were diced red potatoes, and they were seasoned so that you didn't even need any ketchup.  They were soft where they needed to be and crispy in just the right places.  We ranked the potatoes in the top two on the list of Best Brunch Potatoes.  

What's nice about Mimi's Cafe:
1. Jamie, our waitress, was super friendly and super speedy at coming around to top off our coffees (sidenote: the coffee, depending on what batch you get, might be a bit watered down).
2. If you get the breakfast (with a side of eggs and either bacon or sausage) and don't go a la carte, you also get a glass of juice with the meal as part of the breakfast.
3. The ambience is really cute and comfortable and family-friendly.  It's a place I would like to take my older parents when they come to visit.  
4. Prices are great especially if you decide to go with the full breakfast option.

There WAS a little mix up at the end with my credit card not being returned to me when I paid, but when I brought it up to the restaurant people, they quickly apologized and was able to find it and return it to me.  People make mistakes, so I won't count the incident against them.  Also something to note: I'm not sure how crowded they get during peak hours, but my friend and I went around 10:30, which was a great time to go.  The restaurant itself wasn't totally packed, even though the parking lot would make you think otherwise.  That parking lot was kind of small, but it's not a deal-breaker, especially cuz there's a ton of parking across the street on the mall side if you're willing to walk (I, apparently, was not)."}
{"text":"Just aweful. Bland food, terrible service and overpriced. I had the lemon herb brick chicken with a side salad and cheesy gratin potatoes. It all tasted the same. The drinks are watered down and the food seems like it's just precooked, frozen meals that they just reheat, which apparently takes anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour. The wait staff is also VERY inattentive. I was there with two other people, who ordered two different meals, with the same, bland results."}
{"text":"We went there last night for a seminar on neuropathy. ...we had the roast turkey dinner..Then food was so good. We are going back tonight to try something else. ..I want to try the pot pie....this is a cute little place...all the staff was very friendly..so check them out!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast selections are wonderful!  Not the same old bacon/ham/sausage and eggs! They even offer a very good turkey sausage.  Try the waffle combos.  The waffles are light and crispy.  The fresh fruit toppings are great. Eggs (your way) and sausage complete this very filling meal.  Average priced."}
{"text":"I am recovering from surgery and their soup hits the spot. Was able to get in and out fast. While the back room seems to be the place with kids, I enjoy the natraul light."}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day. We made a reservation, of course. It was crazy packed as usual. But this time was special, my husband and I were going to announce my pregnancy and had a special thing planned. The staff working that day was very accommodating and everything went perfectly! Thanks so much!! 

Would definitely recommend to anyone for a special occasion. Just plan ahead!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible comfort food! The salads are also delicious but you cannot beat the slow roasted turkey dinner. Delicious bakery items as well and the house wine is only $5 a glass..all day every day! Always fresh ... Always piping hot!"}
{"text":"My office is located directly behind Mimi's café, so I eat there often. (breakfast, lunch or dinner. Depending on what time I'm working and when I'm hungry) I am going to be a lifetime customer considering how fantastic their food is. Not to mention their service is bar none and they always take the extra steps to make sure that I'm taken care of. Even though for the most part I order to go as I  take it back to work they never rush anything nor do they cut corners on any of the food or service. I love their staff and food. Keep up the fantastic work!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now (all for breakfast) so this review does not cover their lunch or dinner offerings.

Pros:
Staff have all been very friendly and helpful. (Always a plus)
Haven't had to ask for more coffee yet. They have been pretty good about anticipating the need for a \"top off\"
Awesome muffins! I'm a bran muffin fan (I know... I know...) and I really enjoyed theirs. Blueberry muffin was great also
Lots of breakfast options, from french toast, pancakes, waffles and omelettes to multiple types of quiche as well as a few different eggs benedict options, and crepes.
Also has a lighter menu with less fat and more fresh fruit options.

Cons:
A little more expensive than your usual breakfast place, but not by much.
Bad experience with their cinnamon brioche roll. Came out dry and stale, and not nearly as warm as I'd have liked.

Although some might find it a little over the top. I love the faux-french decor, signs, and other little accouterments to be a nice touch, so plus points from me for the ambiance. To sum up, I like this place quite a bit... and would definitely consider becoming a regular customer."}
{"text":"Went to Mimi's this morning for a free birthday breakfast. There weren't many people there because it's a work day( my assumption). The seating was as fast as it could get with the hostess even holding the door open for us. 
The service was great with Pamela as our server. I mentioned about the free breakfast and was informed that I needed some coupon from the internet to get it. :(
After speaking further with the manager he comp'ed my entrée of Eggs Florentine Benedict in the old school fashion so a big thumbs up for the manager.

Our waitress, Pamela, was very attentive and super nice. Kudos to you, Pamela.

The meal itself was about like you'd find from any corporate chain so there's no negatives there but being a corporate chain, nothing really stood out as knock your socks off good. That I usually find at some of the mom and pop shops but with corporate chains, you have predictability so it's all a give and take across the board. They were very accommodating to make the meal work for you so once again, Kudos to you, Pamela. By the way, I'm not related to Pamela in any way. I just feel that if someone goes above and beyond then they should be recognized for it.

Overall it was a very good experience and is very recommended."}
{"text":"Sad to see how down hill they have gone in the last few years. The menu is different,  not in a good way. Breakfast is only served in the morning, has a smaller menu and isn't worth trying."}
{"text":"Maybe it's under staffing but this place is in disarray. The bar area is a complete mess, the manager is spending more time at the front door with the hostess than managing and helping clean up the mess. The staff is nice, but the current manager on at the time of this writing???? He doesn't know what to do with himself. 

Correction the manager I mentioned is the GM...that's even worse....wow"}
{"text":"They have a very small menu. The selection was horrible. The service was even worse. The restaurant was not very busy. However, it took over 10 minutes to get our drink order taken. Our waiter was not very knowledgeable about the menu and was very, very slow in his service. He forgot to bring my cup of soup out. I had to ask for it after our entrees arrived. The soup was cold when I finally got it. The food made me and my friend sick. The only reason that I did not give a one star rating is because the manager was very quick to respond when we asked for one. Then, he took my friend's entree and my soup off of the check. The server and manager were very nice people and very apologetic (especially about us getting sick). I doubt that we will be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"1st visit to Mimis Cafe and what a 1st Impression they left on me. First of all, I really liked the decor (New Orleans style), especially the lamp (in the waiting area) made from a real trumpet. Our server Mindy was AWESOME and completely welcoming & friendly. It was like you were out-of-state visiting family. As for the food, I had the french toast and eggs, with blueberries & bananas. While they gave me syrup, I never used it.....the french toast was THAT good, it didn't need it. My daughter had the quiche, which was very rich in flavor. Coffee was ok, but that was the only item that did not match up with the service, ambiance, and food. This place definitely deserves a return trip (actually this Monday). YOU have to try Mimis Cafe!"}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow, although I was seated quickly. Corn chowder was tasty but not very hot. Had the Cheddar  Broccoli Quiche. Filling was good, but the crust was really soggy, even the edges. Seemed like it could have been microwaved. Probably won't go back unless that is where others want to go."}
{"text":"Excellent place for Mothers Day
Reservation helped a lot and we were seated close to our time 
Staff is great under fire, extremely busy but service goes smoothly
Very pleasant and upbeat, great kids
Food was great , pot pie a winner as usual
Bravo Mimi's Mesa Alma School!!"}
{"text":"I usually love Mimi's, but lately they've been messing up quite a bit. 
We place a to go order with them at least once/week, and dine in a couple of times/month.
Last night we got the usual: turkey dinner and strawberry walnut salad with chicken. We asked that our bread basket consist of banana bread only, as we usually do. Nick took our order - he usually does.

1. The salad had NO chicken, but we got charged for it, dinner size!
2. The bread basket had 2 slices of banana bread and the rest were 1 dinner roll (not even 2!! after all, we ordered 2 entrees!) and 3 carrot rasin slices. 
3. Had we not specified the muffin flavor we would not have got a muffin at all, although it comes with the salad! Every time I order the salad and I don't tell them what muffin to give me, they just don't give me any. And if I don't ask for the bread basket I don't get that either, although it is complimentary!

I am sorry, I wish I could give them a 5 star review because their food is delicious, but they definitely do not know how to treat their repeat customers; the neglijence is unacceptable, especially that we get charged for things we do not get. We will most likely find another place to order from now on."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Tracy took our orders. We Ordered a muffin before our meal and never received it. Had to get up and go to the kitchen to get condiments because she never returned after checking if our food was delivered. As a previous server, I can understand it being busy but it wasn't and there were two servers in our section. I doubt we will be back"}
{"text":"This is my first time at Mimi's, the lemonade is to die for, the breads are warm and wonderful. The service, well I wont lie, it took a good 6 minutes to get noticed and to be greeted. The wait time for the food wasn't bad at all. I had no problem, I love it..

Absolutley great!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, not as appetizing as it used to be. Prices at high for the portions. Service left a lot to be desired. I used to love this place. Not so much now. We will not be back. Husband was equally unimpressed. They didn't even get his order right or make good on the fact they didn't. Oh well, another great place losing it's flair."}
{"text":"Service isn't always on point but I love the Pot Roast and the French Onion Soup
Ambiance is nice and French/Mardi Gras décor.
Drinks are $3 :( I usually get water"}
{"text":"I don't know what I'm more confused by- that someone could ever mistake Mimi's Cafe for a bar (because the bright yellow/purpley/flowery outside didn't give it away)... or that someone would give it a low Yelp rating because it isn't a bar...


Anyway, Mimi's does a great job at doing what it's supposed to do. Nice family atmosphere, decent food, decent prices. Not much that you'll die for and just *have* to come back for, but good enough that I'll keep it on my list of top breakfast options."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy coming here, but recently with the new menu changes, I will not be coming back. The food is meh. This past time I went in March, I made a reservation for Sunday lunch for 5 adults and 2 children. They forgot our reservation, so they stuffed us in a small booth where I ended up having to fit two highchairs on the end. They brought out the wrong meal, and we tried to let our waitress know, but she just didn't care enough to check on us. In fact, she never got refills for our drinks. We ended up having to find a manager to ask her to get us the right meal. It's too bad, because this used to be a fun place to eat."}
{"text":"Crowded on weekends during brunch hours. Wait time can be close to an hour. Food is pretty good especially the breakfast/brunch menu. I like the low carb options with turkey burger, eggs and a glass of tomato juice. Service is above average. Prices are inexpensive and overall its a good place to try out atleast once."}
{"text":"I agree that I don't understand why there are bad reviews for this place.  I review based on the establishment, not my idea of what I think the establishment \"should be\".  I am from Chicago, but my mom lives in Chandler, so we go here when I come for a visit because I really like it.  Everyone is super friendly and they have QUICHE!  And it's GOOD quiche.  I have a hard time finding that on a menu anywhere else, so I usually get it when I'm there.  I love their lighter menu and I LOVE LOVE LOVE their muffins!  That Buttermilk Spice muffin is TO DIE FOR!  Its not some fancy restaurant, just good food and good service without being Applebees or some crap place like that."}
{"text":"I am rating this a \"one\" because the service was so very bad! They weren't very crowded but it took forever to get our food, the waiter didn't apologize for the delays or anything. 
There were three of us, my husband ordered a basic turkey burger and it was so bad he couldn't even eat it the waiter saw that he didn't eat it and never asked if it was okay or anything. The other two meals were average the muffin was great!
I wouldn't go back the that location, may try a different location to compare."}
{"text":"Great quite atmosphere. Waitress was very attentive. Food was excellent. Manager gave us free muffins for being first time guest. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Went to Mimi's for Mother's Day and had a horrible experience. I never complain but this experience was unacceptable. We had reservations at 9:15 and arrived at 9 and was told our table was ready. At 9:30 we were still waiting and when we approached the host he was very rude- snapped we were already checked in, said he had no idea how much longer and when I questioned why we were td our table was ready he responded \"i don't know what to tell you\". When we were finally sat it took 15 mins foe the server to greet us and food took an hour and a half. Bu time the food came my kids were done and I had to take them home and left my husband to eat with his Mother. So after 3 hours of waiting around I wasn't even able eat my Mothers Day breakfast. 

I understand delays and running behind and Mother's Day is hectic but the amount of waiting, rude employees and lack of apology was ridiculous. If you consider making a reservation for a special day here I highly recommend rethinking it."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in this place. Photos of their food online are nothing compared to the real thing. Talk about fraudulent and deceptive advertising. I did my first order here to to go and when I got home I was disgusted. I ordered the half roasted chicken that looked amazing online and I got a thin dry piece of rubber and burned cold fries. I will never eat here again. I would give zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this Mimi's for 10 years. I just came out of it feeling I will not come back. I ordered Corned Beef Hash. When I tasted it, it was slightly spoiled so I sent it back. Afterwards, manager took so long to come out and with nonchalant attitude said sorry. I cannot believe how terrible I felt as a customer. Manager needs to shape up and relearn customer relations. He still did not apologize sincerely for the spoiled food. When I mentioned it at the end when my check was brought out, he simply said how would he have known if the food was spoiled. Its his restaurant. Whethet he knew it or not, food was spoiled. Apologize first rather than give lame excuse to a regular customer. They just lost a regular customer."}
{"text":"We ordered breakfast right when they opened. What is striking is how unclean this restaurant is. The booth seats are dirty. The bay window tile has food on it. The carpeting has dirt, food, hair, etc. The bathroom floors stick to my shoes and have an unpleasant odor. Remember, this is on a Saturday at 7:00 am. My flatware was dirty with sticky particles all over my spoon. Perhaps their focus is on great food. I'll know when it arrives.

Ordered the Sante Fe omelette. With the exception of asking the manager to have to cook/chef prepare my potatoes as depicted in the menu, the omelette is maybe the best I've had in a long time. Kudos here. 

Service is warm and attentive. 

Overall. My food was good. The restaurant needs new cleaning protocols and a new mission of cleanliness. All of these things were brought to the attention of the manager.

{"text":"Has been going downhill for years. Used to be my favorite place. Recommend they dig out menus and decor from 10 years back. Tries to be upscale, but fails. It was better when it was fun and friendly."}
{"text":"There were many black plastic pieces in the chicken dishes we ordered. After showing this to the manager and they confirmed \"yes, it's plastic and contamination from the kitchen,we just got a \"sorry and we can offer you a desert.
  We decided to pay the bill immediately and will NEVER go there again. I strongly suggest another restaurant."}
{"text":"We came back here after living out of state a few years. Food is horrible! It used to be our favorite place. Menu completely different, over priced, and just awful. My chicken and guac sandwich came out freezing and, instead of guac i got two floppy black avocado slices that i couldn't even cut through. The pancakes for my kids were hard and chewy and the waiter gave my son the wrong order. The waiter was very nice and apologized but there was virtually nobody there snd it took about an hr for our food. Never coming back again. If it wasnt for the waiter being so nice we would have bounced mid meal."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times and the service is always spectacular!! Jay was our server this time. He was super attentive and extremely nice! The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they recently changed the menu (new owners) and I miss some of the old items that made me fall in love with Mimis!! My vote: bring back the chicken parmesan and the chicken cordon bleu. :)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, food was fine. Had the turkey and brie sandwhich meal. Sandwhich was good, fries were cold. The reason I give 3 stars is because I'm being gracious. The service...was so flipping SLOW. There are only a few couples in the whole place and we were there for an hour and a half for ONE sandwhich. Definitely wouldn't recommend if service is important to you."}
{"text":"Even though this is a chain and we tend to support local indies,  my family loves it here and we will keep going back. 
The service is always spot-on and the ambience is always pretty quiet and pleasant.
I suggest the asiago spaghetti with chicken and artichokes or the turkey sandwich.  I've tried most menu items and have never been disappointed.
For dessert, you must try the bread pudding.  I've found myself trying to replicate it at home to no avail.  
We've also had Mimi's \"To Go\" family dinners. They've been a god-send on busy nights and we usually have leftovers the next day.  Also, their holiday meals are SUPER-CHEAP, usually around $80 and those easily feed 6-8 people.  I'm a Mimi's holiday meal convert now."}
{"text":"Decent food, but the environment is surprisingly noisy. Tonight, we got stuck next to a woman (likely a single mother) with a VERY noisy brood of undisciplined children SCREAMING. 

There's no way the help or management at Mimi's couldn't hear it, but out of fear or apathy chose to pretend it wasn't happening.

Others around us were staring at them too. 

Like I said, usually good food and I like how they offer soft drinks to go, but way too noisy of a place. Especially a place that tries to be a bit fancy.

Advice to management: don't worry about being \"mean\" by telling undisciplined kids to use their inside voice. Everyone around you will appreciate it."}
{"text":"Our server, Gail, was awesome. Everyone who works there was so nice. The food was ok. Appetizers, soup, fries, good and the entrees were average. Not bad. We had a good time! Sadly, the place was empty."}
{"text":"So far the service is stinking... Food is just OK"}
{"text":"This was our first time at this Mimi's location. We absolutely loved it. Danielle was our server and she was excellent. Our drinks were never empty, our food was spectacular, and we were very impressed by the warm and comfy feeling that Mimi's has. The banana pancakes were wonderful, especially with the caramel syrup. Danielle was more than gracious, and we will certainly be back soon."}
{"text":"I was disappointed on my last visit.   The food was \"okay\", but I expect exceptional when I pay for a meal.  I was also surprised by the waiting staff.  They were not very friendly, and made me feel that I was taking too much time sitting at the table...even though there were numerous open tables available."}
{"text":"This was a very sad experience. We went on a Sunday night at about 7pm. The place was empty. It took some time to seat us. Tea took forever. Bread took forever. After 35 minutes waiting for simple food my dear wife got pissed and we left. Because I have honor, I wanted to pay for the tea on the way out. Even that took forever. I hoped that for the prices they charge and the fact that the place was empty that the service would be good. All I learned is why the place was empty. We then went to Cheddars next door and had a nice meal."}
{"text":"Went here with friends for breakfast.  Since we were a group we waited for a booth, although there were several open tables, but not quite comfortable for us so it was worth the wait.  
Our food took about average time to arrive and was hot or cold as it should be according to what was ordered.  We were attended to periodically by a nice server, not too much attention nor too little.
Overall I would say average, but the food was really good and worth another star. 
Since we got into a booth off the main room it was much quieter and a nice breakfast venue.  This was a Saturday, not sure how Sunday goes.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Mimi's is one those placed where you want it to work out.  From the outside, it certainly looks the part.  Shyly beckoning as you pass.  Whispering a siren song that proves eventually irresistible.  Do not be fooled.  It feels as though I viewed this experience through beer goggles at first and woke up later with self esteem issues.  Not really sure what I am trying to say except that the visage you see from the street that seems quite enticing has no bearing on the food.  My chicken pot pie contained the entire chicken (or so it seemed).  It had already broken through the crust and was eyeballing the front door when the waiter brought it our table.   It looks like the chicken fought pretty well up until the end however.  Perhaps with a lesser chef the chicken might have prevailed.  In any event I was really bummed.  I have always loved faux french food served in a Thomas Kincaid style restaurant.  Oh...I'll go back.  Cuz I want this relationship to work.  The  Perdu I had years ago will haunt me it was so good.  Perhaps it was just an off nite and maybe thats just the way French folk make pot pie.  Yeah...also...the artichoke dip was really really bad too.  However, who orders artichoke dip @ Mimi's?  I have no idea what I was thinking.  But still, it was awful.  How can that be?  Our seats were pretty good though.  I could keep an eye on my car in the parking lot.  There is some comfort in that.  The chicken suggested I trade in my car for a newer model..but we'll just have to see."}
{"text":"For years this place has been amazing BUT tonight we went for my mothers birthday and immediately we were excited because the menu always had a good combination, tonight we learned that Mimi's has been bought out and they re-did the menu. 

This new menu sucks has sandwich's and burgers and then there speciality meals no variety. My family and I were very disappointed and left after looking at the menu. They're might be hope for Mimi's when we left the restaurant the manager asked us \"hey, why are you guys leaving?\" We explained our situation and  He explained to us that so many people leave because they don't like the changes that have been made. Mimi's will be changing the menu again this may. Hopefully  for the better."}
{"text":"Had the turkey, Brie sandwich. Delish!!!!  Waitress was awesome. Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"We recently had a bridal shower in their room off the rest of the restaurant. It was great!! The food was wonderfu! Our server Liz was WONDERFUL! They allowed us to come in and decorate with what we wanted. The manager Marco was a pleasure to work with. We had a party of 40, it was just perfect for a Bridal Shower Luncheon. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I was in Mesa and I was looking for a restaurant around Alma School and I stopped at Mimi's Cafe and I tried there sandwich it was really good I will go there again...."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal patron of Mimi's Cafe in Chandler for about 12 years. Unfortunately the quality of the food and service has been truly awful for about the last year. I keep trying because I remember all the good meals we've had there but the last 3 times have been so awful that I will not be back. Ordered an old favorite..pot roast. It came out cold and dried out. Next time I ordered the beef bourguinon which turned out to be cold dry pot roast with a wine sauce poured over it. I was offered another choice so I took the pork chops. They came out in about 5 minutes raw. The manager came over and said she was sorry and that I wouldn't be charged for the meal. No kidding.  Last week I tried again. This time I ordered fish and chips because my wife told me she would divorce me if I ordered anything remotely related to pot roast. The fish came out overcooked and dried out which required tearing it apart rather than breaking apart in like most flaky fish does. I ordered garlic sweet potato fries with the fish which turned out to be cold soggy non garlic fries. When I questioned the waiter he told me that sweet potato fries were supposed to be soft cuz they don't fry crispy. I told him to ask the kitchen to try again which they did and were delicious the second time. Too little too late"}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Came in for breakfast on a busy Sunday morning and still had speedy and great service. We had Brie and mushrooms omellettes and the veggie egg white ommellete, both worth a try if your in the mood for ommelletes although there was a lot of stuff on the menu that looked great. The food was good and came out fast despite it being busy. Server was very attentive with refilling drinks and checking on the food. After the meal the manager loaded us up with a variety of different muffins because it was our first visit. Had the muffins the next day for breakfast and still delicious. Food was good. Server and manager were great."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning place was very busy and food was amazing!  

Try the crepes!"}
{"text":"2 Stars. Should be 1, but the Waiter was pleasant. Food was luke warm at best. Potatoes tasted strange, and the \"Fresh croissant\" was clearly microwaved. We've been here a few times, and this will be it for me and my Wife.  You can get better quality food, faster service, and half the price at Ihop. First Watch blows this place out of the water."}
{"text":"Took my son here and the menu is all new, my favorite salad isn't here any more so I had to try something NEW. My son did too. 
Okay, the first bite was like \" You have to try this\"!  My son wouldn't let me have any of his :) It was so good. Haha
Grilled chicken is what I ordered and he had the bacon cheddar burger.
It was late so we were after there dinner rush but hey what do you expect at that time of night, once we were seated we were taken care of well by our server and the manager.

A NOTE: to those POEPLE that go out to eat and argue in public, STOP!!! Church Lady in the next booth was such a \"B\" My Gosh shut the hell up already and go bitch in private. The poor guy walked out with his head down :("}
{"text":"I used to love this place ...my family and I  came for breakfast today .the service was horrible !!! We ordered our food and 30 minutes later the waiter \"remembered\" to bring our muffins then we finally get our food 45 min later . I ordered ham crepes with cheese on top. The cheese has two sliced cheese just on top not fully melted and my food was cold it was gross. Then my children got their pancakes with no syrup I asked the waiter for syrup and again he forgot .My husband ended up giving his to them. Management needs to look into their service and the food. You lost a long time customer. Never again!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times, once for breakfast and once for dinner.  The food is good but overpriced for the amount you get.  The employees were nice and the service was fast."}

Arrived at 10:15 stood in a long line the door, just to check in, until 10:50 only to be told it would be another 2 hours before we would be seated!! Are you kidding me?! The reservation was to eat, not to check in to wait 2 hours to eat!! ALSO not the first time this has happen to us at this location. Staff was doing NOTHING to apologize or offering to make their mess up right with customers.  DONE WON'T BE BACK!!"}
{"text":"Mimis Cafe! Mi mi mi mi! I remember the first time I went to a Mimis, I was about this tall and lived in Orange County, CA with me Ma and seesters sometime in the midst of the harrowing hell that was the Reagan era. Punk rock ruled the hearts and Duran Duran ruled music television and BMW's painted the streets (doesn't anyone buy American anymore?). I think we had ditched my Da or he was out on some sort of alcoholic binge somewheres of a seedier nature surrounded by other people with like fuzzy boundaries, cold dark and rainy. 

Mimis was a warm blanket on that cold dark rainy day. The smell was a slap my face telling me what is fine and good and worthy of respect. Comfort in a sometimes seemingly uncomfortable existence (it's not really, relax people. unless you got a real corker and need a laxative or somethin'). The other day for lunch walking through the doors with a good friend reminded me of that first day. 

Mmmmm... yes please, I'd like some more tea. I was prepared for breakfast, eggs Benedict, but we didn't arrive until after noon. :(  So after pouting I chose the turkey pistachio salad on croissant and an order of onion rings with blue cheese, jogging with a tasty cigarette. Yah? Well I was rushed OK. The sammich was well built and tasted of fowl-ly and fruity goodness. The onion rings and blue cheese were sinfully handled into my belly. I think the old bat sitting in the next booth got a little flush, oh my goodness that's not how you're supposed to eat. Oh yah! pre-sandwich my friend ordered a bran muffin! Her muffin was delicious, especially after I buttered it. I ate most of half of it and then save a bite or 2 for dessert. She also had a salad with blue cheese vinaigrette, I think. I was too frantic about choosing my own lunch to hear what she had ordered but gods almighty it was scrumptious. I wanted to lick the bowl.  

The service is regular as a healthy baby and as right as rain and this time was no exception. I think I had a gallon of tea in a pint glass that never reached the bottom. And smiles and how do you do's and thank you's littered the place. 

With bill paid we headed out and grabbed bigger handfuls of even more chocolaty mints than we had on the way in and ran and giggled all the way to the car.

And 5 stars for the overall experience, nostalgia included."}
{"text":"I took some family here who were visiting from out of town. It was that busy even though they sat us all the way in the back of the restaurant, we were only a party of 6. The food was great, the prices were pretty high, so needless to say our expectations were set pretty high also. Our waitress took about 20 minutes to greet us before taking our order, then it took another 15 minutes for her to bring us our drinks and take our food order. It then took another 35 minutes for us to receive our food, which was expected. Again our food was great! Our waitress did not come back to check on us or refill our drinks... In fact we did not see our waitress again until 50 minutes later when we flagged her down as she was passing by to go to another table, just so we could get our check. Our bill was well over $100, and I was a little embarrassed for even bringing my family here. Such a poor experience. I even asked to speak to the manager, which our waitress conveniently said that he/she was unavailable..."}
{"text":"We love Mimi's, don't get me wrong but a few months ago they changed their menu.  I honestly miss the old menu!
But if I could ask one thing of them, it would be PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD CHICKEN POT PIE! the new recipe is totally different to me, different crust, different filling (old style was creamy and thick, new style is runny and tastes like gravy) and half the size....oh dear!
I've been a longtime patron, and the chicken pot pie was my comfort food standby. I have to find somewhere else that does up the chicken potpie right....Unless Mimi's goes back to the old recipe!  
IF IT AIN'T BROKE DON'T GO FIXIN IT!!! : )"}
{"text":"We have been doing team meetings here for a couple years.  Marco is amazing! He is always so helpful, kind and professional.  We get the best care from him!  He deserves accolades."}
{"text":"I had the quiche. It was huge! And Eddie is a really great waitress! Oh and I got a slice of cake for being a first time patron :)"}
{"text":"Tonight for dinner my husband ordered French Pot Roast and I had a Cobb Salad. Both were delicious.  The server was very attentive and friendly.  Always a very enjoyable dining experience at Mimi's.
It is one of our most favorite restaurants in the east valley."}
{"text":"Paid for 40 dollars worth of food through doorDash. Only received half of my order. I could only receive a 5.99 Refund for the delivery fee for some reason they wouldn't refund me for the rest of my food. Paid 40 bucks for two eggs undercooked, sausage and a small amount of cold potatoes. WILL NOT BE GOING BACK. Shame on you for taking my money. Terrible business ethics."}
{"text":"Tried to order their advertised seafood skewer dinner with just shrimp. Was told by waitress, Lisa, that they no longer had shrimp, it was out of season. Yet, all my emails they send daily advertise until May 21rst.
...then table that sat next to us ordered same plate with only shrimp. Their waitress didn't state they were out and lo and behold it arrived with shrimp.
.....grrrrrrr"}
{"text":"Went to go for breakfast after having not been here for a long time. When we came in, there was a wait. As we sat,  we noticed several empty tables. When she finally called our name, now mind you its been 10min, we were offered tables that were empty when we first walked in. We were so mad. I said something to the hostess about how insane that was and we walked out the door. Horrible customer service! Never again."}
{"text":"Celebrating my moms birthday and family voted for Mimi's at Mesa. Sadly the worst decision hands down. The waitress Geraldin ruined the night...so rude. I gave her the benefit of the doubt. I thought, perhaps it wasn't her best day or she was stressed over a party of twenty arriving. Geraldin mentioned while taking our order \"order now because a party of twenty is coming in and it will take longer to get the food\" and felt rushed. While the night progressed, I was convinced she wasn't a nice person. Geraldin made the comment \"I should just stay here because how long I've been standing here\" and made facial undesirable expressions. Besides, the food wasn't as good as I imagined it would be. I will not be visiting Mimi's anytime soon. Au Revoir and Vas te faire encule Geraldin!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Took 45 minutes to get our food and that was only after we asked what was happening with our order. The waitress didn't come by once to see if we needed anything or to refill drinks. When we got the salad it was with no dressing and wilted lettuce. Afterwards we got the muffin and soup which should have come first after we ordered. Had  to ask the manger for the check and even that took 15 minutes. Bottom line terrible service!"}
{"text":"We go to Mimi's occasionally because my husband likes their chicken and their tomato soup, and I love their Meyer lemon mussels.  Well now that I don't have kids nearby to cook for on Thanksgiving, we decided to try Mimi's for our holiday meal.  We had a reservation, and of course they were very packed.  We only waited 10 minutes past our scheduled time...we were very specific about the type of table we wanted.  Had our first course: french onion soup and Caesar salad = good.  Rolls=good.  Then our entrees.  Large portions, pretty tasty, but totally cold.  Asked the server to toss them in the microwave but she assured us that they did not do that.  We were brought  a second full serving.  Barely warmer.  Let them know.  Said we would just take it home and reheat.  The manager came to our table...JIM...and comped it all.  WOW!  Did not expect that...Classy Jim.  We will be back."}
{"text":"They're a little bit on the pricier side of things but this place serves an awesome breakfast, and the staff is very friendly and professional ."}
{"text":"I'm always a fan of Mimis.  Breakfast, lunch, dinner... it's all good.

My old go-to was the French Dip with au jus, which had such tender beef.  More recently I have expanded my palette, and I also come more often for breakfast.  The California Avocado BLT omelette is mouth-watering (minus the bacon).  Get the potatoes fried with onions and peppers for an extra burst of flavor!  

For lighter appetites, the blueberry muffins can't be beat.  There's also a seasonal flavor (pumpkin? red velvet?) that's usually pretty fantastic, so ask your server!

For brunch, try a mimosa or sparkling wine flight.  The coffee is also pretty good, though I'd be even happier with some flavored creamers.

Mimis has something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here! When I came in there was a bunch of people in the lobby which showed me this is the good spot to eat. After waiting 5 minutes, with no acknowledgement, the rest of the people were sat. With multiple 4 top tables open she politely asked if I would like to sit at the bar. I replied, \"no thank you. I'll wait for a table\".She said,\"fine.\" When I asked her how long the wait was considering it was for for top tables open she told me 10 to 15 minutes. Never again nor will I ever refer  any of my friends when they come out to visit to eat here. Poor customer service! lost a customer for life!"}
{"text":"We went to Mimi's because other times the food and service has been exceptional.  This time however the server was rude and seemed not to care about us at all!  She walked away abruptly before we had completely given her our order.  When my food arrived it was not correct.  Instead of offering to make it correct she argued with me about \"that's always the way it comes out.\"  When I mentioned to her that it was not what had been stated on the menu she said that she would have to get the manager.  By the time he came over we were half way through our meal.  A replacement meal for me meant that I would be eating alone and my family would be sitting there with nothing to do.  Another point of contention: As we were waiting for the waitress to come take our order we could hear the manager correcting her for something - loudly!  Very UN-professional to correct an employee where guests can hear.  It made us all very uncomfortable!  It will take quite a lot for me to consider going back to this Mimi's!  When a restaurant doesn't really take care of its guests it is a sure sign they don't want my money.  There are plenty of mediocre restaurants around - I want one that is great!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I first tried it for lunch with my sister and had a cordon bleu sandwich that was so yummy, the waitress was nice and we were both impressed when she brought out two complimentary muffins for it being our first time. I love the French theme and it feels classy and casual at the same time. 
Although it is a bit pricey, it is mostly worth it! 
My second time coming I brought my boyfriend for breakfast. The waitress asked if it was his first time and it was, but he didn't get a muffin so that was sort of disappointing since I wanted him to love the place as much as I did. 
I had the berry waffle and it was AMAZING! So filling, but absolutely delicious. I was torn between trying the banana waffle and the berry, the waitress suggested berry and I'm sure glad I went with her recommendation. 
Since then I have gone back again for breakfast and have had the berry waffle, just as delicious as the first time. I'm the sort of person who sticks to what they like, but I have tried my partner's plates that consisted of omelettes and they were very good as well. 
We have tried their dinner menu as well. I getting the quiche (I think we'll stick to this place for brunch)
So far I have tried 4 different types of their muffins and each time I am tempted to buy a pack for home. My absolute favorite has been the pineapple upside down muffin, although I'm not sure if that was for a limited time. The blueberry rocks too. Oh and their mocha latte is so good!
It's safe to say I'll be a repeating customer!
P.S the house wine isn't worth it"}
{"text":"Read everyone else's review if you want the \"I know it's a chain but...\"  I do really like Mimi's Cafe!  I come here only 2-3 times a year, but my feet hop-skip-to-it when it does.

1.  Love their carrot raisin bread (google it, you can make it too)
2.  When I'm ill, sometimes I only want to eat is their french onion soup and the white rolls dipped in it
3.  When I'm craving liver (heckle me, it's ok)... well this place wins as a default cuz who else serves it?!
4.  Brunch is great especially for the money (last time it came with fresh squeezed OJ)
5.  Just tried their $9.99 Lunch 2-course menu, the grilled shrimp and asparagus was very good.  Beat my expectations!"}
{"text":"This recent visit (9/13/2014) was because I received a BOGO coupon through my email and thought it was a great deal. I visited this location awhile back when I lived nearby and thought might as well go again since I remember it being good.. wrong.

Sad to say it wasn't the same, it was far from it. First off at 8:30am on a Saturday morning it was rather empty, that should have been our first clue. Second, the hostess (older lady with glasses) was rather indifferent about us being there. She looked me up and down, then said \" just two?\", without so much as a Hi or welcome attached. That was the only glance we got our way while she wiped stains off the menus and made smacking sounds with her gum..oh and can't forget the awkward silence before she finally said to follow her. After she sat us down, my boyfriend commented to me about her not even looking as us. He was rather annoyed at the unfriendly greeting and it kind of ruined the start of our breakfast on a beautiful Saturday morning. 

Thankfully, what changed the mood for the better was our server, she was what you'd expect a hostess to be. She was friendly, conversational and made us finally feel welcome. For awhile she made us forget about the rude person in the front. 

So onto our food experience: Our food was alright, not amazing.. I'm not sure what changed with this place, but something is different. No complaints about the food, it was average and came out like we ordered. I've definitely had more memorable food.. hehe i'm a breakfast lover..

When we finished, we felt satisfied and happy with the service from our server.... but as we were leaving we passed the hostess again... and well she was filing her nails by the hostess stand near the menus and only looked up to say \"thanks for coming\" then looked back down without even stopping what she was doing.. That is grooosssss, but at least she looked at us this time..

I really hope the managers actually read these reviews, because if they cared about customer service and hospitality they would make changes. This experience makes me not want to come back, the BOGO was not worth it. Can you imagine how far her fingernail shavings flew around inside?

By the way... I recommend Sunny's Diner in Tempe. 10x better than this place and half the price."}
{"text":"Always good!  We go often thanks to their coupons & gluten free menu (Available on request) Salmon...yum  Mousse....yum Bread basket...really yum (that I remember)"}
{"text":"Had a nice Friday evening date night at Mimi's Cafe! My husband and I stopped in randomly--we have driven by this place for years and just never came in. We both enjoyed our meals, and our server was so friendly and helpful. Would give it 5 stars but everything took longer than a normal restaurant would (waited 10 mins for sodas, waited a while for bread, dinner, and then the check took a bit too long)"}
{"text":"I did the \"survey\" section of the review first, and started laughing hysterically at the \"Attire\" question.  My first time back at Mimi's in many many moons, and it was for a friend's pajama brunch party.  And as we proved, almost anything goes as far as attire for Mimi's Cafe :).  

The reason I stopped going to Mimi's was that, for the same amount of money, my mom (my normal Mimi's companion) and I could find amazing food, versus the just ok fare at Mimi's.  And having gone back again, my conclusion still stands.  The food is decent, and even good, just not spectacular, or wow-tacular or even yummy-tacular.  (I also reserve the right to completely make up words)

I'm an adventurous eater, and Mimi's... it's not adventurous... at all, which is great for people who want to have normal scrambled eggs (without cream/milk), normal breakfast potatoes, normal mashed potatoes (yes, I did order 2 forms of potatoes for my meal). 

Mimi's Cafe is definitely for the faint of heart.  :)"}
{"text":"The grilled salmon with spinach and roasted potatoes is my absolute favorite! They have a large menu with options for everyone. Great for large groups too."}
{"text":"My favorite thing to get at Mimi's is their hot chocolate 'bucket'. It is the best in town (from a connoisseur like me!)"}
{"text":"Yes 5 stars. Blame it all on the server Scott who was quite the host. He was charming, professional and personable. I went to dine with my mom who had said the service was slipping the last time she ate at Mimi's. He was so nice to her and the guests in the booth behind it was a pleasure to see.(yes I was listening..don't judge). I want to make sure for anyone who goes there to request Scott or want that level of service. The food was good had the grilled salmon per Scotts recommendation and it was spot on. Mimi's Cafe you have an employee that other companies aspire to hire. Don't lose him, he's one of the good ones."}
{"text":"Last Saturday night we went there for dinner. There were only 5 or 6 tables taken, but the hostess said that there would be a 15 minute wait. When I looked at all the empty tables, she said that a cook walked out and the kitchen was backed up. There was already a party waiting. 

As we were waiting a customer came out of the dining room and asked to speak to the manager. A woman came out of the kitchen and the customer complained that the food took a long time and wasn't good. She told him that she was the only one cooking and really didn't know how to cook.

Needless to say, we, and the other party left."}
{"text":"It breakfast here yesterday with my family and had the quiche Florentine. It was so amazing I came back today for the same thing and unfortunately it was cold. I wasn't going to bother the waitress again and she seemed upset that I had asked for my sour cream which I had asked for her in the beginning when I ordered and had also requested hot sauce. So I ate it cold and it was gross. I hate paying that much money and not have great customer service or good food. I guess the one time a great meal was just a one-time thing. Unfortunately will not be coming back"}
{"text":"We went here for a dinner last night. Not a common dinner house for sure but with so many option in the area we like to spread it out some. The service was pleasant and fairly attentive although our server never came back to check if our entrees were acceptable. Seating at the bar was nice to watch the game...however the lighting is blinding. We requested it dimmed a bit and it was. Much nicer. Calamari was good, albeit boxed I'm sure. Wife enjoyed the muscles and I had the shrimp pasta. Beware; that pasta, while reasonably tasty..doesn't loo much like the picture. You'll get six boiled shrimp and if you are lucky maybe more than a few specs of broccoli. Don't expect much other than noodles with a pretty strong garlic taste. Meal wait time was exceptionally long given the very few patrons in the place also. Overall it was 'ok' for $14.29 but nothing to write home about. Pricing was reasonable with food for two at about $36. Wine comes in at $8 a glass but these are 6oz pours- sadly presented filling the glass (with bar pour marker used) only about 35%....if you only pour 6oz then use a smaller glass and the value would be perceived better. Lastly we got up at 8:05pm to leave. We were the ONLY two people in the entire place. That alone should tell you something...Stick to this place for breakfast folks."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We understand it is Mother's Day and all restaurants are experiencing their most busy day of the year. Called before Sunday to make a reservation but they were filled, understandably so. Went to this losation at 10am to be added to the waiting list expecting and hour or so wait. Were told it was approximately a one hour wait. Waited for over three hours with no table only to be told they were no longer seating due to long kitchen ticket times. Asked for a table to at least sit and have coffee (most of the tables in the restaurant are empty at this point) and we were told no. Manager was extremely disrespectful to a handful of elderly couples just wanting an estimate of time. Old blonde hostess with the purple flower in her hair was the nastiest person I've ever seen working in the industry. Ignored questions, mean looks to customers, not one smile. She was the worst part of the experience. Disappointed in the fact that there was no communication to guests. We would have completely understood if we would have been told we would have not been accommodated today. Work on your customer service. It needs a lot of help."}
{"text":"Well the first time we ate here it was TOGO & that was because I was craving French toast so we settled for this & hot damn was there cinnamon roll French toast bomb! When we went in to get our food it was packed which was great and our food came out in a jiffy! I can't wait till we go in and eat!!"}
{"text":"I just took my wife and daughter to Mimi's. If you like REAL New England clam chowder then look no further than this place. They only serve it (sniff) on Fridays. It is rich, creamy, and full of big chunks of fresh clams. Couple that with a full menu of great lunchtime or dinnertime treats and you'll come away satisfied. The service was impeccable. The staff was very friendly and they work together as a real team to give their patrons a truly memorable experience. Love it love it love it! The muffins are great and when they found out my daughter hadn't been there before they gave her four muffins to take home with her absolutely gratis. I had the Cobb salad which never disappoints. My wife ordered off the two course special menu and got asparagus with citrus shrimp. My daughter had the salmon. Everyone raved about how good everything was. The food, the service, and the ambience is great. Two thumbs up...way up!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible....went in for a late lunch and took over an hour to get a French dip and fries....wanted desert and the waitress was no where to be found....that took another 20 minutes ....food was ok..."}
{"text":"I've been here twice on friday's for lunch, were always seated right away. The food is good, great portions and the price is reasonable. Staff well is up in the air first time the waitress suck, messed up part of are order refills took for ever, but 2nd time different waitress, was awsome, quick , nice helpful on the menu and the place was packed. So for that and the food I'd go back."}
{"text":"I really love coming here for breakfast. The buttermilk pancakes are so soft and warm. One of the best places to go for pancakes. The fresh oj is my favorite, I can't get enough of it. The muffins are fresh and moist and did I mention very good? I had their quiche once and thought it was gross, but maybe it was just me? If you go for lunch or dinner the pastas are pretty good too as well as their sandwiches. It's a fun place to go if you run out of ideas, but I definitely suggest go for the pancakes. If you don't like waiting avoid going on saturday or sunday mornings. I've waited 45 min to 1 hour on a Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"I have to say this place surprised me. I have been here before and was not all that impressed. Mom had a coupon and wanted to go so who am I to say no. I figured I could find something I could eat. When we got there it still looked the same but then we got the menu. They have pretty much completely redone the menu from what I remember. It is all French cuisine now. Which I was questioning at first. Really this place is French now? This ought to be good. I finally decided on the Croque Madame. Which is an open faced ham and Swiss cheese sandwich with a fried egg on top. It was really good. I was shocked. I really was. Very good flavor. Everything worked together. The ham was seasoned and cooked just right. Was this the right place.
I say they have changed for the better. Don't know how popular the new menu will be because the general public seems to be leery of food they can't pronounce but I hope it works out for them. I will be back and will tell others about it was well. I really was shocked."}
{"text":"Yet another fancy rip-off.

This used to be one of our favorite breakfast spots. But after today and trying them for one last time, I must express my sadness for how it has gone down the drain.

This is a cute place. Very clean and cozy. We usually have to wait to be seated because it is very popular. This morning was no exception. We requested a table like usual. Now, I know my husband and I are not the most beautiful couple on the planet, but dang, making us sit in the very back and way out of the way of the general public really makes one feel like you really do not want us there. But at least we got a seat.

It took some time for our waitress to greet us and get out orders. But we can wait. We know its busy. She got our drinks really fast but disappeared for a long time. Almost 40 minutes before we got our food. She did fill my coffee up again for me at least.

When we got our food it was pathetic. The pictures in the menu of the crepes we ordered were full of fillings and almost round. My husband got the ham egg and cheese crepe. It was as flat as a tortilla with maybe a sprinkling of super-tiny diced ham and a thin piece of cheese melted on the top. The poor crepe. Some one deflated it and made it bland. I got the banana/strawberry/nutella crepe. Again so flat. Maybe a teaspoon of nutella on the inside. Did not really taste any. Then I was extremely lucky to receive 1/3 of a banana sliced up super paper thin and placed and the front a back of my crepe. The strawberries might have equaled and entire half of a full strawberry if you took the paper thin see-thru slices and assembled them into something solid. These are $9 and $10 dishes!! You could at least given me an entire banana and a whole strawberry. Maybe they had a \"see who can slice the most paper-thin slices of half a fruit and see if the customer notices\" contest with the chefs.

I also ordered a side of fruit. So for around $4 I got 3 super-thin slices off of a tiny clemente orange that was way past expired, and 5 whole red grapes. At least they did not cut the grapes paper-thin. I must be lucky to get 5 whole small grapes.

I understand about needing to make a profit, but dang people. At least try and make the food seem not like a super-rip off. We did complain to the manager and he wanted to just give us free muffins. We said thanks but no thanks. We will not come here again."}
{"text":"First time here in a very long time, service was good, food was just OK. Probably won't be back, too many other eateries in Mesa to try."}
{"text":"We were shocked at how good this place was.

Man... From the reviews, we had really low expectations. But I wanted cinnamon roll French toast and Coco's is an 18-mile drive from us, so we tried Mimi's. 

Eggs perfectly cooked. Delicious thin bacon, not thick and chewy like a lot of places. Cinnamon roll French toast and brioche French toast were both a knockout. We were seated quickly and served quickly. 

New favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"I got a gift card to this place and was excited to learn its menu is like-Home goodness and comfort food options. Although we didn't dine in, the ambience was very welcoming, homey and the staff were very friendly. However, there were 2 meals I ordered that was quite disappointing: meat loaf and pot roast. Both were dry and the taste was marginal, at best. I'm sure they have other great tasting options because there were customers clearly enjoying their meals, but mines were pedestrian. They needed to be more savory."}
{"text":"I hosted office holiday party on Friday night at 7 for 10 people. Restaurant was not busy at all. Although food was very good, service by Sheila was very poor. Dishes were not picked up. Drinks were not refilled. She was not very attentive to our requests and we had to ask for service. What was very disappointing was when I let manager know, she just said sorry repeatedly, but gave no explanation or incentive for us to return. If you're planning a memorable get together with a group of people, pass on Mimi's Cafe and go somewhere else that appreciates your business."}
{"text":"The breakfast was good, good selection, good food. The prices are a little steep for what you get compared to other breakfast places. The service was also a little slow, it took me 20 minutes to get a coffee refill and the place wasn't that busy. Also, when I asked for a box, that took a long time as well. Overall, just average food and service."}
{"text":"Walked out before we were seated; could not believe the treatment of the hostess, just absolutely rude and confrontational. We experienced similar treatment like this from them on Thanksgiving.  That just seems to be the culture at this particular location."}
{"text":"Come here at least once a year just to see friends since I don't live in the area, I ordered Brioche Cheese Burger with Mimi's House Salad.  Don't really like vinegar for the dressing so I asked for ranch dressing instead.  The cheese burger was very tasty with 1000 islands dressing, one of my favorite other than ranch dressing.  It was cooked medium with still lots of juice on the burger.

Service was great and the location was very easy to find.  They even brought out some type of bread before your meal even comes out.  Good choice of food!"}
{"text":"First time visit and we were very impressed.  We were greeted warmly as we entered and from that point on our lunch was the most enjoyable one we have had in a long time! Our waitress was friendly and professional.  Lunch was served quickly and  presentation and quality was good.  Manager thanked us for coming in and sent us home with 2 yummy muffins, baked fresh at the cafe.  We most certainly will return and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"What happened to one of my favorite dishes !?  The turkey bacon brie mushroom crepes were awful today!  To start, the dish was served not warm and came out looking like there was a stiff layer of glue on top of the crepe that didn't even move when you shook the plate.  The turkey inside was fine but looking and tasting the cold, gelified brie cheese sauce was not good.  I would have brought it to the server's attention but I was not with regular company (didn't want to embarrass her) and I was not footing the bill.  I know,  I shouldn't complain so loudly  since I didn't give Mimi's  a chance to correct it but I've had this entree before and it has been lovely.  So good that I ordered it again.  I will still patronize Mimi's Cafe for they have many great dishes to pick from, I just won't order the turkey bacon brie mushroom crepes next time!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Felt like a burden to our server. Couldn't get our water refilled while she flirted with the table next to us. Got a lecture when we presented our BOGO coupon after the meal. The coupon was the only reason we even considered eating there and we certainly won't be back."}
{"text":"So, the 2 stars is because I typically would give it 4 but our horrible Thanksgiving dinner at this location would warrant 1 star. 
Clearly they overbooked for Thanksgiving...this became apparent because I made a reservation a MONTH ahead and we were told it would be a 45-50 minute wait when we walked in the door at 1:45 pm.  What point is a reservation then really? 
Only because another gal told us it would be 15 minutes and we were rather vocal about the situation did they manage to acquire a booth for us about 20 minutes later. 

Then there was the food...past years we ate at another Mimi's and thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the crowd was managed much better. Additionally, there were snacks and drinks available for those having to wait to be seated (Note to Chandler location: this is extremely helpful when people are hungry and not expecting a long wait time after booking a reservation).  The salad and bread were sadly the best part of the meal...the sweet potatoes were so sweet none of us ate them and half of us wouldn't try the green bean casserole and the other half regretted that they did.  
Additionally my husband and I ordered red wine and they ran out of wine glasses so they served it up in ??? perhaps a mimosa glass. Which not only made the wine hard to drink but, frankly, it just didn't taste the same. 

The staff...good gracious, we could feel the stress the moment we walked in from the hostesses to the wait staff. Our waitress did the best she could considering the crowd but the anxiety all around was tangible and overshadowed our experience. 

Definitely decided next year, we're doing turkey at home."}
{"text":"The food was good - I love their corn chowder!  This time I had a half sandwich and cup of soup.  They no longer provide complimentary bread unless you ask for it ... Which I think is pretty smart financially and so many people are still trying to cut out calories.  Speaking of ... the half sandwich was still 388 calories ... I can have a turkey bagel thin at Einsteins for only 270 calories and feel more full."}
{"text":"Ordered the beer battered fish which comes with fries and coleslaw. Fish was good but fries were soggy and coleslaw was tasteless.  Chardonnay was tasty though. Booth had a foot long rip in the seat back.... they need to get on that. Service was good."}
{"text":"I keep thinking that I will find something I like at Mimis.  Haven't had good luck.  This time tried French onion soup, not sure what it was but had a strange taste.

However I was pleasantly surprised at the fish and chips.  They were crispy and cooked well.  The chips were nice too!  And.....they had malt vinegar, which u can't find too often in restaurants.  Can't have this meal without it!  

Finally a win!  They still get a 1 because everything else was still lacking in quality.  Also to see how run down the booths were.   (Some seats had large red tape holding it together and the booths material is totally falling off."}
{"text":"Great service, creative menu and a beautiful atmosphere all compliment the great tasting foods we had at MiMi's in Mesa!"}
{"text":"If I could give Mimi's in Chandler minus stars, I would for the treatment my family received yesterday on Mother's Day.  We had a reservation for 10:45.  While it only took a few minutes past then to be seated, things went downhill quickly.  Our server was slow to take our order, and once placed, she disappeared.  Finally, at 12:15 I asked when our food might be ready and she replied \"I have no idea, I don't even see it on the screen yet\".  At that point we left, and took my very disappointed mother to Subway.  Thanks to Mimis incompetence in being able to properly schedule staff, they managed to ruin the day for my mother and our entire group, and we will never set foot in that location, or probably any Mimis, again."}
{"text":"We always love the food at Mimis Cafe in Mesa! Our waiter Chaz did an excellent job serving us last night. The winter visitors have arrived and we had to wait longer than usual for our food but it was worth the wait. We still recommend them though. You can't beat the muffins!"}
{"text":"Went to mesa location Fri evening. Our waitress was not not friendly, our food tasted like it came out of a bag or can, and the restrooms were filthy. 
The young hostess was very pleasant.
The french onion soup was tasty and the ice tea was cold. The meatballs, shrimp scampi, specialty sandwich and table bread were very mediocre."}
{"text":"This place needs a lot of TLC. Food was good, but the decor is literally falling apart. The booth we were seated in had shredded materials and needs to be reupholstered. They burned my lunch mates bread for her sandwich and when she made comment to the waitress, no further addressing by staff took place. Would hate to see this \"institution\" go but first impressions say management doesn't care."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely fabulous!  Pamela (server) was excellent, as though we were dining in a 5 star hotel/restaurant.  The order was taken in a timely manner, options were presented to us by our server, the food arrived promptly, hot, and orders correct.  The food was very good, the price was competitive.  Server stopped by frequently--but not a pest--checked on us and made our dining experience extremely pleasant.
Will be returning sooner than later!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and this was the worse service. The waitress was hard to understand, she brought out the wrong drinks, the food was so cold.  The waitress seems to disappear for a long time because she only came back to bring us our check."}
{"text":"We always go to Mimi for breakfast. But today we decided to try lunch. Since it was too late for breakfast. But now they serve breakfasts all day. But we wanted to try lunch. I don't know. Maybe It was the waitress or what? We ordered our drinks my husband ordered mimosas and I wanted ice tea. My ice tea tasted like water. We sat next to the waitress station and I see the tea sitting in ice. Of course it's getting watered down. Why can't they serve it over ice as it sits room temp. Now back to our waitress, she forgot our bread and my water with lemon. So I did drink my husband water. And still didn't get mine till my food came. Bread came just about 3 minutes before food. Took one bite of the bread, and she said he you go! My husband like his turkey sandwich and I had the French dip. Which was good except my French fries soaked in ajus on the plate. All she can say oops my bad I shake a bit. Soggy. Not more lunch or at least when she's there. Gayle was her name. Which we didn't catch her name till we seen it on the receipt. Chandler Blvd and 101 location"}
{"text":"I love Mim's in Mesa!!!  Came here yesterday and had just an amazing breakfast.  Their omlette was fresh, tasty and perfect.  The service here is awesome and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"So disappointed, I chose this place to eat for Mother's Day and I feel I let my family down. They brought my husband and one of my daughters salad out. But my other daughter and I waited another 15 min. For our soup. It wasn't even warm. Then when the brought out the meals. One daughters shrimp and potatoes wear cold, my husbands med rare Brie burger was more like well done hard as a rock, and my other daughters Salmon plate had a hair on it. My Brie burger was cooked right but was cold. When I complained to the waitress (only about the salmon with a hair on it) she was apologetic I did start to tell her about the rest but the hubby and other daughter were hungry and said it was ok. The wuss of a manager brought my daughter a new salmon plate but didn't even stop to apologize or anything, just hurried away from our table. What a pansy. Not even worth the $115 we paid. A ruined Mother's Day dinner. I should've just cooked at home. I feel responsible and let my family down. Never again.  It's too bad."}
{"text":"Normally I love them especially for breakfast but at this location the service is a bit slow and seems a bit understaffed. We ended up leaving w/out desert or coffee just because the waiter was too busy (not his fault just way understaffed)"}
{"text":"Our party of 4 visited for dinner before 5:00pm and were asked to 'wait' for a table when the place was 95% empty. This was just a hint of what was to come which was the worst service & professionalism I've ever witnessed in a restaurant! And the food wasn't far behind. Had to get up to get our own silverware.....was told 15 minutes after we ordered that chicken wasn't available that night because 'it took to long to prepare'. Of course, this then delayed all of our meals. Waited over 30 minutes!! Seriously understaffed & the manager doesn't have a clue! But the customers are the victims like we were. Stay away...this location won't be in business long."}
{"text":"At some point you have to ask yourself if going out to a $30 breakfast (for 2) is better than just staying home and scrambling your own eggs.  I have to say that this was one of those that I should have just stayed home.
Woke up late this Sunday and the wife and I decided to go in search of breakfast.  After passing up a few of our regular options? We decided to give Mimi's a try.  We were seated promptly and the server was right over to take our drink order.  The coffee was good. We placed our order and then waited.
15 minutes later we watched 2 servers carry out food all over the dining room searching for the right table. They found us after someone else came over and pointed them in the right direction.
My entire breakfast was cold. My wife's was hot. Not sure how that happened. Meanwhile my coffee cup is empty and there is no server to be found. If a manager had checked on us I would have sent my breakfast back. The waitress finally delivers more coffee and the check. We just started eating and she brings me the check!? I suppose we need to get out. My wife and I left 3/4 of the breakfast untouched and then tried to pay the check. After 15 minutes the server comes back for the check. (Apparently they didn't want us to leave too quickly.) I probably should have said something but the waitress should have seen that we hardly ate anything. 
Oh well. No need to return. This place is not worth it."}
{"text":"We went to MiMi's for dinner...after being seated, we waited 15 minutes for water and the bread, which was cold.  Our order was taken, then the manager came to tell us that they were out of Chicken-fried steaks, and our waitress would be back to take our order, again.  10 minutes after that, the waitress came back, and took our orders.  After 45 minutes, we still hadn't received our meal. When we asked, she said that the manager was aware of the \"problem\", and would bring our meal out herself.  We waited another 5 minutes, then just got up and left.   We went to Village Inn, at Dobson and Southern, was promptly seated and given water and menus ... within 5 more minutes, we placed our order for chicken-fried steak dinners, received our appetizers and then  our meals before we could make a dent in the soup and salad.  Jamie, our waiter, was awesome.  He got the gratuity that the Mimi's waitress blew.  Don't bother with Mimi's....go on down the street to Village Inn for that comfort food dinner!!!  
This wasn't the first bad experience with Mimi's, at a different location...they regularly run out of menu entrees."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast! We came around 1 pm and had the place practically to ourselves. The service was pretty good. If it's your first time you get a free muffin! 
Hold on to your receipt people! There is a quick phone survey and at the end there is a code you write down. They offer either two free muffins or two free croissants with the special survey code."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Good food, nice menu selection, clean, prompt service and good wine! Nice employees, and fair prices! Good location, right off the freeway!"}
{"text":"I had never been to Mimi's Cafe before I joined my networking group. (Chandler Networking Professionals every Tuesday at 12 just in case you were wondering). The staff here is very accommodating. The food is always hot and fresh. Lately I have been getting a chicken Caesar salad with blackened chicken. It also comes with a muffin of your choice. Other favorites menu items of mine are the BBLT and the Le burger de Madame. It's a bacon cheese burger with a fried egg.  Stop by if you're looking for a good lunch. Also if you're looking for a place to host an event or group meeting they have a huge secluded room that could accommodate you."}
{"text":"I ordered the Fire-Grilled Seafood Skewers with shrimp and scallops, and substituted the corn on the cob for French fries. They brought salmon instead of shrimp. The French fries were several hours old, soggy, and limp. French fries are cheap, and they had to cook the rest of our meal fresh. Why serve really old food? The Greek side salad was delicious.

Apparently, they don't have cocktail sauce, which seems odd considering they serve shrimp and fish. Points go to the server for volunteering to whip up some, but that means you can't count on having this traditional condiment with your seafood.

My boyfriend had the Bacon  Avocado Burger on sourdough. It looked good, and he enjoyed it. His fries were gross, too.

The strawberry lemonade was yummy. One glass is enough because it's very sweet. The zucchini (?) bread that is served before the meal is tasty.

We have eaten here two times prior to this visit, and the food was good. This time we arrived an hour before closing. I understand that people want to go home, but an hour before closing is a pretty good buffer. If they are just going to give me what's been sitting around for hours under the heat lamp, and get my order wrong, I'd rather go some place else."}
{"text":"My first experience was terrible experience all around, from the wait to no one coming around for over 30 minutes for refills or to order, then a different server finally taking the food order, waiting another 30 minutes for food. Also, the food was mediocre. Needless to say I won't be back, ever."}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for the past 20 years and have been coming to this Mimi's for quite some time. The service gets consistently worse as each year passes. I preferred the Cocos on Dobson and baseline, but they recently closed. I will have to find another breakfast spot because I refuse to give my business to a place with atrocious customer service. I'm giving two stars as opposed to one because the food is decent."}
{"text":"The food was yummy and the atmosphere was cozy. We enjoyed are meal and the waiter was very friendly. I'll be back to enjoy another yummy meal.


We had the salmon with spinach and potatoes. It was perfect. Dessert was chocolate lave cake with strawberries...yummy."}
{"text":"the only thing that's even halfway decent here is breakfast. 

don't order dinner here unless you have self respect issues.

they have good toast.

sad that this is all i have to say, isn't it?  that's really how i feel."}
{"text":"two words:
\"bonjour, y'all!\"

that is what is printed on the sign as you walk into this place. for most of you, that is enough for you to understand how i feel about this place. if not, i will expand.

imagine the restaurants in disneyland - fake brick features, a silly, comptely out of place new orleans main street decor. do you recall the simpsons episode where moe tries to turn his sleazy bar into a family restaurant, and sells it by saying, \"if you like a bunch of crazy crap on the walls, then come to Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag\"?  ....that's the feeling i get here: 'if you put stereotypical new orleans items on the wall (mardi gras beads/french horn), they will come.\"

i guess i can't be that pissed about it, becuase come they do - this place was packed. i'm pretty sure i was still drunk from the night before, and i wasnt' about to let go of my glory - boo to no drink specials, and no drinks besides beer and mamosas - not even a bloody mary. having spent the last four hours of beer time doing shots of sun kist, i was not about to even look at orange juice. thankfully, our server suggested a Hibiscus - champagne and cranberry juice- score!

in fact, our awesome server was this outing's only saving grace. she had a terrific sense of humor. the monterrey omelette looked fantastic, and the person who ate said as much. i had a quiche (like i said, i was drunk still) the crust of which was extremely greasy. potatoes were ok, better than your average home fries. 

mamosas cost $5.25, but come with the mini bottle of champagne comes with, and most breakfast entrees come with juice - so you really end up with two drinks - not bad.

but seriously, the atmosphere is horribly family oriented."}
{"text":"I have since found out that Bob Evans sold this off and they have gone to a more French menu.  This explains the reduction of choices.  I am not impressed and will likely never go to Mimi's again unless there is a change in the menu."}
{"text":"Always a good choice. Service is VERY slow but the corn chowder makes up for it. Good menu choices and staff seems to always be friendly. They also have good breads and muffins. Good place for any of the 3 meals."}
{"text":"Can you say \"carrot raisin muffin?\"  Can you convince your breakfast mates to order the same and give them to you?  My poor husband knows the \"drill\" all too well!  They taste like good old fashioned carrot cake - just the right amount of nuts.  I really like Mimi's for breakfast (truly something for everyone,) and on breakfast, I give them four stars.  The reason for three, is lunch and dinner...nothing at all special."}
{"text":"We came in mid-afternoon on a Sunday when it was very slow for the restaurant. We waited for quite some time at our table with no servers coming to greet us or bring water--to make it clear that we were ready to order, I closed my menu and sat waiting, but no one came. A female server was walking back and forth to the other tables but never acknowledged us, so I had to request for a server to come to get water, at which point we were ready to order. 

It's 100° outside, and I'm 7 months pregnant. Bringing water and acknowledging your customers should be commonplace in a restaurant, especially during summer months.

Our server, once he finally came out to help us, was friendly."}
{"text":"The butternut ravioli special is very good and so is the pre-dinner bread.  get the roast turkey if you are hungry!"}
{"text":"Waffle and banana chocolate chip pancakes are good. Service not so good. Had to wait for about two minutes for the hostess to show up. Waitress didn't smile at all :("}
{"text":"My first time back at Mimi's in five years, and probably my last. The service was great! Our waiter was very polite, and attentive. It was the food that was more than a little lackluster. My boyfriend ordered the smoked salmon omelette ($13.29) and I chose the quiche florentine ($9.29). When our food came I was disappointed to find that my \"fresh fruit\" side consisted of 2 orange crescents, half of a half moon of cantaloupe, and 2 slivers (emphasis on SLIVERS) of pineapple. 
The Quiche was equally disappointing. It was very oily and plain (not traits you really want in a fresh breakfast) but the far-too-chewy crust created an unpleasant texture that I could not pallet. My boyfriend's meal was absolutely delicious though. All in all, a C+ or B- experience. If you do go here, don't get the quiche."}
{"text":"Perhaps the worst experience in a restaurant ever. We waited for over an hour for a table, never got one. They claimed to be short one cook, but they were clearly short many staff. Many tables were left on the bussed. If I could give it zero stars I would."}
{"text":"We have been here many times, and every time really enjoyed it.
This time however, is the rating for our server. 
My girlfriend,having worked in many restaurants says this is one of the worst experiances ever! I have to agree.
Our Server Tracy,was not having her day at all. I don't know if she was mad to be there, or she did not feel well, or what it was. 
 She never brought us the bread basket and when we asked for it, she brought it right before the meal was over. It had one roll, and one very small piece of the cake bread they serve. If you have been to Mimi's you know the bread is a big plus. 
She never took away the dirty dishes and slammed the plates on the table when she brought them. She never even refilled our drinks. THe manager was doing a drive by and asked if Tracy was taking care of us. 
We had to say well, we would like more drinks please.
We were watching the other servers give great customer service as they always do there. We just got the one server that did not want to be there.
 Customer service can make or break your experiance any where you go.
We were not feeling it.
 We will go back, but make sure never to get this server Tracy."}
{"text":"The food, fantastic! Penne pasta with bacon. My girlfriend got the fish n chips the french fries were old and greasy. Had to send then back and listen to a lame excuse why they were brought it that way.They put us st a small table which seats two which was fine, but there is no room for you not picking up the used dishes. They left us no room between the table crap and the bread plates. Then the meal, please take the plates, please take the drinking glass since you are bringing me another glass. Had they used common sense with the small table and been honest about the fries or just said we apologize and brought fresh  they would have  gotten 5 stars"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here for breakfast all the time...we love it...service is friendly...it's usually quiet and private...we've had dinner a couple of times...loved the jambalaya, salads and burgers...yummy"}
{"text":"Ah... there's nothing like going to an old people's restaurant to make me feel young again. 

My 8 year old daughter just completed her AIMS testing this week and to celebrate she wanted to go to Mimi's Cafe. Now that I think about it, she also chose this place to go to for her 6th birthday....

I knew there was a reason why I called her my \"little old lady\" this whole time...

When we got to the restaurant the hostess sat the three of us at a small table right in the middle of a pretty empty room. What few people were there got to sit in the booths so I already felt uncomfortable and a bit agitated over that. The waitress that served us was nice though.

I've been here a few times before and thought the food was good, but this time around it just OK. I ordered their salmon that came with brown rice and vegetables and it didn't have any flavor to it, although to be fair, I did order it off of their \"Fresh & Fit\" section, where all the choices offered are 650 calories or less. The friend I was with ordered the \"Golden Seafood Duo\", which came with 1 (right, 1) small piece of beer-battered fish and 3 tiny little pieces of shrimp and some sides. He thought it was good, for what little he had.

Besides those two dishes, I really do enjoy their french onion soup and the mini bread basket they give you. If I ever come here next time I think I'll just load up on that. Sweet carbs and salt....yum yum yum"}
{"text":"Words cannot explain how AMAZED I am of this small little cafe! My first impression when I walked in was that this place was a smaller business and they would be just an alright place. But boy was I blown away. Our server, Tracie gave us such wonderful service! She was very knowledgeable of the menu and showed us many different options and how we could make it a meal that we wanted and would enjoy. She was on top of our table amidst her many others and was very upbeat and friendly. I enjoyed the food here as well. I had got the chipotle burrito and it was very delicious with a rich flavor and not too spicy! Their freshly squeezed orange juice is very tasty as well. I have absolutely no complaints of this wonderful place and this will definitely not be the last time we come!!! By the way, what a perk, if you've never come before they give you FREE muffins!!!!! Thank you, Tracie!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time last night. We like Mimi's but, had never been to this location. Nice parking lot and clean restrooms.
We were seated by a very fun girl who was speaking French with my girlfriend. Don't get her started,hehee.
Anyway we got a nice booth in the back. Our server was very attentive.
The funny thing was he told us his name was Chance and when the Manager was checking on everyone to see if they were good ,he called him Zach. Plus the check said Zach. Oh well everyone should have fun at work I think.
Anyway, our food was good, we got the Fried Zuchcinni. Which is always good at all the locations we have ever tried.  It is very lightly Breaded and comes with really good Marinara sause.
I got the Pot Roast, my Gilrfriend the Salmon. Both were very good, just wxtremly saltly. We were so thristy even into the next day. Food was good, just too much salt for seasoning. Service was good. We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"I've loved Mimi's Cafe since they first showed up at this location back around the late 90s.  Their bread they gave you was amazing and their portions were big and fresh.  It was a favorite.  I don't go out to actual restaurants too often anymore, but when my aunt comes to town we always go to Mimi's.  Normally, we go to the one in Chandler, but this time we came to this location.  And I was disappointed.

For starters, we came in and the host greeted us a few minutes later. He then proceeded to tell me how he was in the back debating with other staff about whether or not the morning or evening bus staff was lazier.  Yes.  He actually sat there telling me that he was in the back doing anything but work... and discussing how lazy his co-workers are... and that the rest of the staff were all in on this high school gossip together.  I probably should have said something, but I didn't want to make things uncomfortable for my mother who has Alzheimer's and gets confused and upset easily.  So I chose to, instead, half-heartedly commiserate.

After being sat, the waitress came over and in a very quiet, soft, barely audible voice started taking our drink order.  My aunt has two hearing aids and still struggles with hearing, which is difficult enough in any situation, but more so when the waitress (who should have a clear, confident speaking voice and outgoing personality) mumbled her soft, shy, insecure questions.  But ok... fine... she clearly isn't meant to be a waitress, but perhaps she needed to be a waitress to learn that she shouldn't be a waitress.  It wasn't that big of a deal... yet.

She brought our appetizer out but didn't bring the bread, which is pretty much the main reason I loved Mimi's.  So I had to ask for it specifically and then anticipated the beautiful basket of thick slices of carrot raisin bread and soft sourdough rolls.  Well, the basket arrived and things were a bit different.  The sourdough was basically still fine, but rather than the thick, delicious slices of carrot raisin bread... we got little, tiny discs of carrot raisin bread.  Little UFO shaped, no bigger than a silver dollar, baby frisbees of bread.  That sort of defeats the appeal of a bread that's supposed to be full of big pieces of walnuts and raisins.  There was no appeal here.  None.  I had one sad little disc and realized it wasn't even worth it.  I despise when restaurants get cheap and lazy and change features like this.  Can you imagine if Red Lobster stopped serving Cheddar Bay Biscuits and instead gave us only sad, crunchy breadsticks?  Or Mexican restaurants decided to forgo chips and salsa and just gave us thin tortilla strips and Tabasco?  That's basically what this felt like.  I was really bummed about that.  

Then the food came (and our appetizer wasn't cleared off) and it was... meh.  My Turkey and Brie sandwich on a croissant tasted old and dry, but edible.  My aunt's Chicken Pot Pie had almost no vegetables in it.  My mother seemed happy with her meatballs, but let's be fair... she lives in an assisted living home... anything is probably better than what they serve for dinner there.

My aunt is big on desserts.  Especially when she's on vacation and especially when she's treating my mother.  So then the meal ended and she cleared our dinner plates (appetizer still sat there) and she brought out the check.  She didn't even bother asking if we wanted dessert or if there was anything else she could get for us... she just... brought the check.  My aunt at this point was really annoyed.  She asked her, \"Are we not allowed to have dessert? Do we not deserve to be offered that?\"  The very shy, very insecure, very soft spoken, out of her element waitress was a bit speechless, quietly saying she was sorry and looking thoroughly confused.  I was sick of being there and I said forget it, we'll just go get ice cream.  This waitress not only failed to add money to the overall bill, thus increasing her tip, but she ended up losing a couple bucks off of her tip in the end. 

Finally, we leave.  And I'm a bit ahead of my aunt and mother (they're almost 70.. they're slow) and as I'm walking out, the host is on his phone with an earbud in his ear, staring at the screen and ignoring me.  No goodbye... no have a nice day... just focused on his damn phone.  My aunt and mother follow a bit behind me and my aunt (for whatever reason) decides to complain to him about the waitress, like the host has any kind of power.  He gave a obligatory apology but was giving my aunt a shitty, millennial-attitude look... as though what she had to say was irrelevant and she was an idiot.  Parents with teenagers know this look.

Needless to say, I will not be going back.  I might try the Chandler location again to see if they are still maintaining the standard I expect, but forget Mesa.  Never again."}
{"text":"It's wonderful to find a Mimi's in the chain that actually makes me smile!!! Arrived for brunch with a friend, not too busy, we were seated just inside the lounge. Kinda thought it odd, but as it became quite packed in the restaurant, I couldn't have been more pleased at our seclusion. Scott took great care of us from insightful recommendations to his sparkling style, that only he can bring. Today we had French Toast with eggs, thick bacon and amazing red skin potatoes. We also loved the Farmhouse Tacos: hickory bacon, sausage, potatoes, cheese, pico ~ everything but the kitchen sink stuffed in corn tortillas.  So happy to find this location. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Slow service, to order and end to end.  Have to ask three tims for extra butter that was requested when ordering.  Ask r refill coffee, had to carry cup up to get it.  Food was dry.  Poor service is getting to be the norm here."}
{"text":"Now I'm talkin' big salad! Always get to go, and this was perfect. Best takeout salad (aside from Oregano's). Got the cobb salad with honey mustard, perfect. Big, chopped lettuce and plenty of side toppings. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the portions are small.  Prices are on the expensive side considering how little you get.  I'm not saying that I would never go back...but Mimis won't be on my list to visit again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Dined at this restaurant today with my partner, my Parents, and my sister and her husband. Service was mediocre at best. Food was good. But one of our meals was not brought to the table till about 10 mins after the other 5 meals. Other than a curse apology from the food runner, nothing else was said. And the room we sat in was like an icebox.  Will not return to this place again."}
{"text":"I got the salmon omelette with capers, the eggs were a bit overcooked but overall quite yummy. They don't give cottage cheese as a sub for potatoes, but they will give you sliced tomatoes. My boyfriend got the eggs Benedict and it was devoured by him instantly - I'm guessing it was delicious since he didn't share  the star was the perfect pumpkin muffin. Mary was courteous and facility was clean with quick service. I enjoyed myself but just felt like this place was average as far as food quality and price."}
{"text":"You can always count on Mimi's and the Mgr Jim to provide a good dinner and dining experience   When we visit family for the Holiday in Arizona Jim does his absolute very best to serve a home cooked meal.   The line was short and as always the food was very very Good...."}
{"text":"We accidentally checked into this Mimi's when we were at the other one. Usually yelp doesn't let you check in if you're not in the vicinity, but... it did this time. 

Long and short - we loved our meal at the other one. Hopefully this one is just as good."}
{"text":"I was there on Friday night about 9:00.  Not very many people and it seems that this place is short staffed.  No hostess, and only 2 servers for this large place.  My server was very good - he gets high marks!  The food was another story.

I ordered the lemon sole, a side salad and that's all.  With tax and tip the meal came to $20.00.  The salad was nice and fresh and crisp.  The lemon caper sauce was tasty, the sole was not very good.  I did mention this to the server and he offered to replace it, but I didn't want to wait.  It was supposed to be \"sautéed\", the chef does not know how to cook fish!  It was fried and was crispy and tough.  Sole is a tender fish and doesn't need much cooking.  I was very disappointed in this dish and would not recommend it.  

As always, Mimi's does have good bread, but the rest of the food is not so hot.  This was what I thought a rather expensive meal (well not a lot, but more than $5 or 10!) and way not worth it.  Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I am so sad! Mimi's used to be a treat for me to go to because my food was fresh and tasty and the wait staff was awesome. Not the case anymore. I have never wanted to not leave a tip but we experienced a terrible waiter and mediocre food. I did not even like my muffin. I had the seasonal pie apply upside down muffin that tastes like a metal can. Oh yummy! The cold quiche looked like it came fresh from the microwave and I won't tell you how gross my Cesar salad tasted. Needless to say I won't go back there ever. I am sad! Mimi's I predict you will be the next location to go out of business."}
{"text":"I was a fan of the original menu at MIMi's. Now that it's all changed out I won't be back. Jalapeños not available either? You know this is Arizona, right?"}
{"text":"A friend and I visited on April 4/4/17 for lunch. Service was really slow. I ordered a French dip with a cup of onion soup. My friend ordered the croissant with turkey and brie and onion soup. I bit into my sandwich and came close to spitting the bite out. It was not only cold it was refrigerator cold. My friend was completely finished with her meal by the time I was given a new sandwich. I couldn't tell you if it was hot or not I asked for a box and a container for the au jus, paid my bill and left. The manager came over as we were leaving and said he had been told about the sandwich. At no point was I offered a discount on my decidedly disappointing meal. In the future I'll get my French dip at our tiny local cafe much better food at less than half the price. I decided to have the sandwich for dinner tonight, sharing it with my husband. There is barely an ounce of au jus, maybe enough for a dry dip sandwich."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place! I would say its pretty decent I had the sandwich and soup lunch . My sammy was delish and my tomato basil bisque was enjoyable. Nothing really blew my socks off but nothing was bad. My point is you'll get a good meal but you wont be craving it later."}
{"text":"Food was fine. French onion soup was great. Not very busy so could sit and chat. Servers were friendly and kept drinks filled"}
{"text":"I just don't understand why anyone eats breakfast at a place like Denny's when you can go to Mimi's and have SUCH a different experience (like servers who haven't been up late drinking the night before).  I have always loved this place (it's on my A-OK chain list), especially for breakfast.  The atmosphere is cute and charming, the servers generally seem to be a higher caliber and I love the variety of flavors on their breakfast menu.

If you sign up for the Mimi's e-club, they instantly send you a coupon for a free breakfast (up to a $10 value).  With items like Pain Perdue Stuffed French Toast, Eggs Benedict Florentine and a Chipotle Breakfast Burrito it was a difficult decision.  I, however, settled on the healthiest option (I checked the caloric content on the website), the Capresse Omlette which was just delish and includes diced tomatoes, red onions and basil topped with sliced tomatoes and fresh mozzerella and a tomato cream sauce which I ordered on the side.  My dining partner ordered the Ham & Cheddar Croissant (a whopping 1,235 calories, but apparently worth it) with breakfast potatoes.  So, along with being a price Nazi, I've become a calorie Nazi.  Most of the breakfast entrees include a freshly baked muffin and fresh squeezed juice.  It was a perfectly delicious and very filling breakfast.

Our server was just fabulous and I gave her double the tip I normally would have since I used the coupon for a free breakfast.  I can't wait to come back here in a week or two, and BTW do try to come during the week if possible as the wait is significantly less."}
{"text":"Mimi's is great for some down home food... good for a chain.  I always like the french-ish decor.

While I've had many meals here, I've only had one since gluten free, and that was a salad, so I don't have much to report on that subject. lol

At this location, I had the Waldorf salad with grilled shrimp, which they had some awesome seasoning on it.

Service was good... they were real attentive to my food sensitivities. :)"}
{"text":"We've now dined here twice within the past month. Partly due to the free email offers provided. Our first meal for lunch went well with great service and a tasty sandwich and crepe selection. Unfortunately, on our second visit for dinner,? it didn't go as well. Our salmon was under-cooked and the pork loin though flavorful was a bit dry. After asking for the salmon to be cooked further, it again returned raw in the middle. Louis the MOD, thoroughly apologized and replaced both of our meals. The new orders of pork loin and chicken was perfect. He unexpectedly comped our entire dinner stating they wanted to ensure they wouldn't lose our business. I must mention that their baked goods are extremely moist and delicious. We will be back."}
{"text":"Received a very bad service at Mimi's in Mesa today.
Although it was very busy I got the wrong order and then was told there is no way to tell that I got the wrong order. They did not have enough servers on staff for a busy Sunday. Very disappointed first time ever."}
{"text":"We were unsure about eating breakfast here.  But I have to say that the food is absolutely amazing! We will be coming back next year. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We arrived around 10:00 and waited 10 minutes to be seated. They were not busy, there was not a line, there simply wasn't a hostess. Several other staff walked by us, but they ignored us instead of asking if we'd been helped. Finally someone came over and asked if we'd been helped and showed us to our seats. 

Our waitress was friendly but seemed harried...she kept forgetting another table's order (write it DOWN, already...restaurant pet peeve #4, serving staff who try to remember everything but can't, but refuse to get out the order pad so they can get it right) and when the table behind us complained of too much cheese in their omelette (crazy, right?), the waitress just said, \"Oh, sorry\", and kept on walking. Super tacky. If someone tells you they don't like the food, you should offer to make it right...can I remake your omelette? Can I bring you a complimentary muffin? Can I take 50% off that dish? Nope, just \"Sorry\", and a quick walk away. Not professional. When that table was getting ready to leave, the waitress offered him a box, and he said, \"No, I don't want to eat this. I don't like it, remember?\" and she just took the plate away. So basically the guy paid $10 for something he didn't end up eating. Not cool. 

Mimi's food is usually pretty tasty, but today was \"meh\". My mom's quiche florentine was cold and underseasoned, my orange creme French toast was soggy and mushy. The hollandaise sauce I asked for as a side with my eggs was obviously from a mix...why not make fresh? It's easy and doesn't take long at all. The only thing saving Mimi's from a 1-star today were the tasty roasted potatoes and the fact that my water was refilled promptly (empty water glass = restaurant pet peeve #5)."}
{"text":"Was meeting up with my sister-in-law; no sight of her when I pulled up. I sat outside in  front and the hostess came out and asked me if I had been helped. Told her I was meeting someone and she got me a free coffee. Texted SIL who told me she was already seated, tell hostess my name. Same lady, said she forgot to ask me. So I waited in the heat for no reason. Anyway - we ordered salads with baguettes. The salads were ok; my cobb was chock full of goodies but the chicken ceasar had very little chicken. The baguettes were hard and no butter was to be found, had to ask for it. When waitress brought it she asked if we would like the bread basket and said she would be right back. Five minutes later she comes with a diet coke and neither of us were drinking that - somebody didn't get their soda. Still no bread. Ten minutes later it finally arrives. She comes to drop off our check and had never asked us if we wanted refills or anything else. I tell her that I want to order a dessert to go and she takes our check and disappears for another ten minutes. The food was okay, the service was lacking."}
{"text":"I like the free basket of carrot bread.  You can even get it for breakfast if you just ask.  The service is good.  The prices are good.  The food is good."}
{"text":"Very good. Took my niece and brother! Very very delicious. The server was amazing! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We had a nice breakfast out my only complaint and it's very minor is where they seated us they put us in a main exit for the area that we were in and it was a very very narrow pass and they kept bumping my wife chair as they went by service was okay I had to wait a while for refills and the meal seem like it took a very long time to come out of the kitchen but it was all very very tasty"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I called THREE times to confirm our thanksgiving reservation. I was treated with attitude each time. I showed up 29 minutes early anticipating a crowd

The wait was OVER 90 minutes despite having made a reservation. The management is completely apathetic, the wait staff rude, the hostess vile. 

I will not be back. I will actively campaign against a restaurant who can't manage crowds, act graciously when in a bind, and who just can't handle a crowd 

HORRID.

Editing to include our dining experience: we were seated and waited over 20 minutes for a waitress to take our drink order. 15 more min to receive it. ALL WRONG. 

Food was served hot (surprisingly) but all orders were wrong. Never got refills on any of our drinks. Kept receiving food for other tables (which we were tempted just to eat after a while). Pecan pie was disgusting. Tasted like one big glass of burbon. So disgusting. 

Nobody took leftovers home."}
{"text":"We went to check it out for as possible business breakfast my husband has coming up. The environment is very loud so he won't use it for business but the food was good. He had orange creme French toast that he loved but way it would be way to rich for my preference. The bacon and eggs were good but I was most pleased with the fresh fruit that accompanied it, ripe and tasty! Another had the waffle and turkey sausage. She said the waffle was good but nothing special. She didn't like the turkey sausage flavor. Service was a bit slow but we weren't in a hurry. They offer mimosas and other morning drinks if you're looking for that. We weren't but it's nice to have the option."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it. We were starving, the three of us left to go exploring without a proper breakfast and by about 11:00am were ready to start chewing on the seats of the rental car. We found this place food came out fast and all was right in the world again. We all had French onion soup, my wife had a grilled cheese, I had a burger and our friend had some kind of chicken sandwich thing. Everything was cooked right, no complaints which is saying something for our hungry little group. The manager came around and gave us a couple free muffins to take home since it was our first time there. We also got a 12 pack of croissants to go that were great, insuring that we had a little more to eat before we left in the mornings for the rest of our trip. This place was exactly what we needed, a nice little discovery."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of the chain restaurants so prevalent in the Phoenix area. However, because this Mimi's is so convenient to the Chandler Mall and Nordstrom Rack, Lowes, Ulta etc  I don't want to say anything too negative, especially since I am being a \"local\" snob. After all the food was fine, service was good and everything was pretty decent overall. 

Mimis is a safe bet."}
{"text":"I love mi mis for breakfast everything is always hot and tasty, service always awesome too. I never have any complaints with them. If you have never been head on in for breakfast you won't be disappointed. 

I love the French toast and bacon my favorite!"}
{"text":"A cute little cottage close to the Chandler Fashion mall.  When I enter the restaurant I get a homey feeling which scream: Mother/daughter date.  My favorite part of this restaurant is the breakfast food.  Lunch/dinner aren't that great to mention.   However they do have coupons for dinner which give you starter, entrée, and dessert for a good price.  So for that reason only I would go for dinner.  
 
Now on to the breakfast.  The meals come with your choice of juice and some even come with a muffin.  My favorites on the menu are the eggs benedicts.  For the original: the flavorful ham center the dish.  It's a bit tough for me and the saltiness overpowers the dish.  But it does add a nice contrast to the gooey egg and sauce.  I would say the eggs are \"over-cooked\" for egg's benedict compared with some other restaurant.  I would've preferred over-easy or even over-medium eggs insteads for an eggs benedict.   The hollandaise is thick enough so that it isn't runny that would drench the dish, however still thick enough to have that creamy consistency.  I wish it had more flavor though.   It comes with red skin potatoes on the side.  With just the right amount of salt, it complements the eggs benedict well.  Try the florentine, and crab cake florentine eggs benedict for a twist on an old favorite.   
 
Wake up early for breakfast or brunch for an eggs benedict and shop 'til you drop at the mall after you have satisfied your tummy.  However don't expect too much from this mediocre restaurant unless you have a coupon. :D"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! Go around 4pm and you well Have the place to yourself.  We were 3 adults and 3 kids.  I had the Steak Frites medium rare.  The steak was cooked to perfection and was most as it could be. You cash take my word for it.  I raise and butcher my own meat at home and seldomly or it when at a restaurant. Aside from the outdated appearance of the restaurant,  it could be a perfect 10! Don't judge a book by its cover.  Get in there and eat well!"}
{"text":"The eggs were grey, the bacon was burnt, and the pancakes and French toast had onions in them! When they came out a second time, it was raw! On top of that the manager was a jerk to our waitress. Now I remember why I haven't been to Mimi's in over 10 years."}
{"text":"This place is so fattening and the portions are huge.  I think the ambiance is cute and I love the carrot bread they bring to your table for free.  Otherwise I mostly go for breakfast and stick with oatmeal and iced tea."}
{"text":"I've always thought that Mimi's Cafe was for girls and for grandmas. But I'm glad I let my wife talk me into going here after getting out of a quinceanera mass, because one, we were starving, and two, the food and service were outstanding! Let me begin by saying, it is always nice when the service is so good that you almost don't have to ask for anything. Service wasn't overbearing, but it was nice to know that they appreciated your busines and wanted to make sure that you didn't go without anything.

It just so happened that it was our server's very first day on the job (no waiting experience whatsoever I might add) so we got to break in a newbie. He didn't take our order, because he was busy with another customer, but he told us he was busy and he'd come back, but one of his co-workers took our order instead. Nice save Mimi's, nice save. With our orders taken and drinks served, our over eager newbie thought I had water, and served my more water. However, I was drinking Sprite, not water! I told him so, and without hesitation, he brought me out a fresh Sprite. No apology necessary, as the problem was quickly fixed, but he did so anyway.

Moving on, the other server, not our newbie had messed up our son's order, as he ordered mini cheeseburgers and apple sauce off the kids menu and was brought a grilled cheese instead, and because of that, the general manager brought us out a 4-pak of their delicious muffins  for \"our troubles and inconveniences\" and apologized for the aforementioned troubles and inconveniences and for the newbie's first day, but we were quick to point out that it wasn't the newbie's fault and that he had fixed his mistakes promptly, but hid the muffins before they decided to take them back! LOL. Awesome! Never in my life have I had an establishment go above and beyond to rectify their \"poor service\" so quickly, but Mimi's, you guys raised the bar and I will never forget my first dining experience here!

Moving on to the food, I had the Cobb salad, asked for ranch instead of blue cheese dressing, and for the blue cheese on the side. That's exactly what I got, and you can't beat a simple salad with fresh ingredients like the salad I was given. Everything equally portioned, not one ingredient over powering the other. My daughter's grilled cheese was rather tasty for being a simple grilled cheese and I'd recommend the Mediterreanean chicken pasta that my wife had which was outstanding! I'd also recommend the honey bran muffin which was perfectly baked!"}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal! The service is friendly. The wait time is reasonable. The prices are fair and affordable. The portions are generous. The French pot roast will knock your socks off. The herb de province pork chop is outstanding! We've eaten here a couple of times and everything has been delicious every time. The only drawback has been when they run out of something-- usually the special. That's happened to us more than once."}
{"text":"been taking family there for years and very pleased with food and service. but several months ago I noticed the decline in food and service. finally a couple of months ago we went for breakfast and the food and service had gotten so poor that I wished we had gone to  Dennys.  I spoke to the manager and he apologized but was not interested in what I complained about. haven't been back and won't until I hear it's back to the way it was.  although its not expensive, I will not waste my money.  Chompies is our new breakfast favorite."}
{"text":"Not what they use to be. Was my favorite breakfast spot but with changes in the menu and higher prices I don't think we will be going back.  Three stars are for the staff . Our server tried very hard to accommodate my gluten issues but hate paying almost eleven dollars for a scrambled egg and some fruit. Where did the potato cake Benedict go? When I go out to eat like to have something I can't make at home. Sorry Mimi' s but this is so long"}
{"text":"My half roasted chicken looked and tasted disgusting.  The kitchen staff seems to not care how food is cooked or presented.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We just had take-away from Mimi's and it was very good. The Quiche Lorraine was perfect- fluffy and flavorful. The chocolate mousse was a little disappointing. It was just a bit too heavy. It was well-packaged for take-away, which I appreciate."}
{"text":"My first time visiting today and what a great experience! The food was good and overall the service was excellent. Ana our server was friendly and always checking every single detail. Part of a good business is customer service and Mimis Cafe is a 100%. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Just placed my order for chicken tenders because I was told I cannot substitute chicken for shrimp on the brioche Trio. I don't eat shrimp! What a disappointment that it can't be a simple substitution..."}
{"text":"Awesome little bar inside. Almost italian-esk but its located in the center of the restaurant which is odd. The spicy bloody mary's are nice and they have very creamy crepes. I had a hair in my food and they promptly took it back and within a few minutes a new plate arrived at the table. The manager came out to make sure all was ok and then they comped the plate due to the hair. I like to decor but it was oddly set up. A little of everything we americans think is \"european/ french\" Not true french but decent americanized french place/food.  Crepes + but over all - its about the same as an olive garden."}
{"text":"Had a great waiter and delicious chicken, pistachio and basalmic vinagrette dressing!  Loved it!  Loved the leftover takehome muffin I had for breakfast this morning too!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Being from New Orleans, I appreciated this place. Nice decor and food was dang good. Mac and cheese was to die for. Thank you."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food. LORI is the freaking best!!! Great service every time. Goes out of her way to make you happy. Always has great suggestions. Best server out there!! Thank you Lori!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Mimi's for breakfast! So lemme clarify with the star rating: breakfast/ brunch = 4 stars. Lunch and dinner = 3 stars. Their breakfast menu has so many lovely choices and pictures. K so here is what I have had:

Breakfast:
Eggs benedict - Very good but a bit too much ham on it. Got to a point where ham was all I could taste
Eggs florentine - AMAZING! One of the best benedicts I have ever had! Eggs are always cooked perfect, hollendaise is light and creamy, and I love the mixture of the tomato, bacon, and spinich. This is what I order most of the time. Used to get the eggs houssard which was the best but they did away with it which always happens to me!
Crabcake benedict - Good but the crabcakes can get a bit overpowering and they turn this breakfast into a very heavy one.
Mixed Berry Pain Perdu - Great for if you have a sweet tooth. They give you tons though and after awhile, its a bit too sweet at least for me. Still liked it alot though.
Chipotle Breakfast Burrito - This is surprisingly very good considering its not from a mexican restaurant.
Ciabatta Breakfast sammich - Very good but a bit too much meat for my liking. I think I will order it minus the ham next time. But the rest of it taste terrific.
Quiche - Have had a couple different types (brocolli and cheese, crab and sweet corn) and I can say that Mimi's makes some of the best quiche I have ever had. Very light and flaky crust with fluffy eggs and great mixins
Carrot Bread/ Blue Berry muffins - Some of the best bread and muffins I have ever had. Always warm and fresh
Redskin Breakfast potatoes - Pretty good. I prefer greasy hashbrowns though

Lunch/ Dinner:
French onion soup - Good soup. Better be good cause this is one of the things I think they are supposed to be known for.
Chicken fettuccine - Was ok, not very memorable though. I liked that it had artichokes and sundried tomatoes but the sauce wasnt very thick and the chicken was kinda bland.
Butternut Squash Ravioli with scallops - This was a special at one point and it was very good. The scallops didnt taste frozen like they do at most AZ restaurants and the ravioli were very light and flavorful. Unfortunately, I am not sure if or when this special will come back

So to sum it up, I am always excited to go to Mimi's for breakfast, however, I don't often consider going there for dinner. I feel that I should go and try more items for dinner/ lunch because the items I have had during those times were not bad. There is definately potential. The prices are reasonable and the service is good most of the time. Oh and I definately need to go back and try their bread pudding at some point to see if it makes the list of best bread puddings.   :)"}
{"text":"Mimi's has always been a favorite spot to go for breakfast and dinner, but this one seems to be of a lower caliber than any other I've  visited. My husband ordered the steak frites and it was nearly inedible. Too tough and not cooked to order. It was medium rare when he ordered it medium well. He's not one to complain, so tried to work his way through it. He was only able to eat about 1/4 of it before giving up. Plus he said it was flavorless. Had our waitress come by to check on our meals maybe she would've noticed that he wasn't able to chew it. But she was working the whole restaurant and acting as hostess as well so we scarcely saw her.  We were extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is great! Love the quiche Florentine.  Hubby had turkey dinner...yummy! Great service too."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, the service was completely awful. My friends food had a hair in it, our waitress took very long in between each request. At least 10-15 minutes. Forgot multiple things we asked for. The manager did not offer much of any assistance nor offer to do anything to try and make the situation better. Never checked on us for anything. I will say the food was good but was not good enough to deal with that. Please work on customer service. We are usually good tippers because we understand the position waitresses and waiters are in but we didn't feel bad for the terrible tip we left. I would like to gain contact with management or corporate. Very poor service."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday after my graduation from Grand Canyon University and boy what can I say. We did not have to wait long and our waitress was amazing. She was super nice and was always checking up on us. The food was even more amazing. I got the malted berry waffles with a triple berry mimosa because of course I was celebrating completing my bachelor's! I do not live in Phoenix but I know the next time I do, I will be making this my regular spot to dine!"}
{"text":"Always a excellent experience at this place. 
Good is always good for breakfast or lunch. 
Lunch / dinner they give you a bread basket 
It's a chain restaurant but a must try.  
 
There muffins  / croissants  are always on point good variety to choose from."}
{"text":"It was a dark and stormy morning. The cold, damp chill made me hungry for a filling, hot Sunday breakfast/brunch. A $10 coupon from Mimi's Cafe prompted me to reroute my trip to try the place out.

It has been about 15 years since I visited last. I stopped going to Mimi's due to poor service and food that was floating in grease. Today was different. I had the hot cocoa and the countryside 2 egg breakfast. There are several variations of this breakfast available, I chose 2 sunny side up eggs with a tender piece of tasty ham, fried potatoes, and a blueberry muffin (the size of a softball). 

The service was prompt and friendly and the food was very good overall. Two small misses kept this from a 5 star experience. A couple of my potatoes were burnt and my cocoa needed to be mixed more completely (I swallowed a couple of undissolved cocoa powder lumps). The place looks very clean, parking is close to the door. The decorations suggest a New Orleans French theme. My bill came to 19 CENTS plus tip. Well, that was after they applied my $10 coupon.

I'm glad I gave them another chance and would stop here again."}
{"text":"My family of five went here for brunch around 11AM last Saturday and the breakfast menu was vast, that it was tough to choose but the salmon omlet was delicious and I ate every morsel + the potatoes it came with (About $12.99).  A nice feature is mimosas ($7) are available! The kids also had a lot of choices on their menuand it was priced just right $4.49. The pancakes were huge and it came with a side and a drink.  Also, it was nice that regular lunch items were available too.  The ambience is nice and the noise level fair.  Although the wait for our food took about 20 mins, I think, it was worth it because where my husband and kids usually go if I'm not with them is Waffle House so I know that the food is made to order and from scratch.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I was told about Mimi's by a friend, and have to admit he was absolutely right about everything! I was referred because of the fact they do more of a homestyle type of cooking  which I love. Anyhow their service was phenomenal and the food had me thinking about it for the rest of the day. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal that doesn't break the bank. Thanks Mimi's !"}
{"text":"Been a long time since I reviewed this.  Been a long time since I came here.  Ever since they discontinued those killer chocolate muffins, in fact.  Those were the added inducement to get me to choose Mimi's over competing restaurants.

Supposedly this place is inspired by French cuisine.  I think that's a bit of a stretch, though they do try to create a French bistro ambiance.  Menu is sandwiches (including \"French dip\", so it must be French...right?), quiche (which real men don't eat ;-), pasta, pot pies, and some other stuff.

Despite my sarcasm, the food is pretty good.  If you're trying to choose between big casual chains like Chili's and Applebee's and Marie Callender's, well Mimi's should be on your radar.  It's at least as good as any of those.  Soups are good, French dip is good, burgers are good.  It's all solidly three-stars.  On this occasion I had an off-menu special item:  baked penne and meatballs.  It was nothing fancy, but I liked it.  Other folks in our party all seemed to like their choices.

If only they still had those decadent chocolate muffins..."}
{"text":"Service was very nice but the food was only ok. Kinda pricey. The pancakes were really good. The meals came out at different Times.  Eggs benedict was terrible.  The egg white breakfast rates great.  The restaurant was not very clean.  The bill was over $45 for three breakfasts. Way to expensive."}
{"text":"Mimis has always been one of our favorite restaurants. We just experienced the most disappointing Valentines dinner ever. 

Took a while to find the hostess.

Our waiter was very slow with the drinks to start with. 

Salads/soups were on the table less than 2 minutes when the entrees came out. 

Waiter asked if we wanted fresh ground pepper, we said yes and off he went. A few minutes later he rounds the corner, stops and takes another table's order and then brings the pepper. 

We then noticed there was no salt shaker on the table. Another few minutes delay while he finds salt, stops at another table on the way and by the time that he arrived, my shrimp and spinach were cold. 

He sent a manager over to apologize and said that he would adjust the bill. He ultimately took 20% off. 

The waiter never asked about drink refills until we requested the check. He should find another line of work. 

There were two other tables near us that seemed to also be having service problems tonight.

That restaurant seems to be very poorly managed. The Scottsdale location is a much better choice."}
{"text":"Noticed a few reviews complaining about cold French onion soup so I brought that up with the Waiter he assured me it would be hot so I tried it off course it came out cold.  Didnt think the flavor was to good.  Ordered chicken salad  sandwich and it was whole wheet croissant. Why would some want a healthy croissant that makes no sense and why would the menu not explain that."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating breakfast here.  It didn't seem as good as last time, the crust on the quiche was a little over done.  That said, the brioche cinnamon roll was great, best I've had in a while.  Also, the potatoes are much better with onions and mushrooms added.  The pricing seems a little high compared to most breakfast places around here.  Still, a solid choice overall."}
{"text":"Needed a good lunch to have with friends at work and this was exactly what I got! The turkey club sandwich was delicious and fulfilling. Although, it comes with fries, salad or a fruit bowl; the fruit bowl had very little fruit which was a bummer!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Mimis Cafe. The whole family should be able to find something they like there. I had the Turkey Pesto Ciabatta sandwich and I loved it so much I went back a day later to get another. Service was great, the waitress was very nice and friendly. If you can't decide where to eat, decide on Mimis Cafe."}
{"text":"I placed an order online for Thanksgiving dinner several weeks in advance, as I would not be preparing dinner this year due to getting knee surgery the day before Thanksgiving. I received no confirmation, which seemed odd and made me somewhat nervous and nothing was charged ahead of time. I picked up my order Thanksgiving Day at 1 p.m. The service was fairly quick and the cashier was very nice. We warmed up the meal according to the directions. However, there was some sort of foreign object in the mashed potatoes so I didn't eat those. And the sweet potatoes tasted burned. The rest of the meal was very good and my family enjoyed it for the most part."}
{"text":"Completely mismanaged! Clueless manager and lazy servers! The manager at this location should be ashamed. We haven't been to Mimi's in years, but were in Mesa today and decided to stop in. The hostess told us 20-25 minutes, but the restaurant (the part we could see, at least) wasn't very full. There were about 10 groups waiting in the lobby and outside. After about 10 minutes of waiting they called a group to be seated and another group absolutely exploded! A man started yelling at the manager, saying they had been waiting over an hour and the manager actually argued with the customer!!! What are you doing??? No customers = no job for you Mr. Manager! They quickly took that group back, then another group started saying they will never come back and had also been waiting over an hour. 

At this point, we decided to just get some muffins to go and go elsewhere for lunch. We went around the corner to the take-out desk and lo and behold, the booths lining the ENTIRE length of the restaurant (at least 10) were all empty! What the heck??? Why are you not seating people when the restaurant is empty? Multiple servers saw us standing at the take-out counter and turned around and walked the other way. The servers were just milling around, trying to look busy, but not actually doing much. It took about 10 minutes for someone to take our order and probably another 5-10 minutes to get the muffins. In all that time, they never seated another group. 

We will NEVER come back to this location. If your servers don't want to work, find ones that do. Seat people quickly if you have the room, even if you are short on servers. I would rather be seated with some water and bread and have extra time to talk to my dining companions and have a slow lunch than to be expected to stand in a crowded lobby for over an hour with nothing to drink. Treat your customers with respect and DO NOT argue with customers when they have been waiting over an hour. Be polite and respectful to your customers."}
{"text":"Not a bad place... the muffins are delicious!  The farmhouse tacos are to die for, yummy!!! Only complaint,  the so called in season fruit, was soo sour. The strawberries,  grapes and oranges all tasted the same."}
{"text":"The food and service was terrible.  Sunday afternoon, restaurant was not busy, but barely saw our waitress.  Other tables were waited on constantly, different server.  Took forever to be waited on, receive our drink order.  My daughter ordered a guacamole burger with fries.  The fries were undercooked and greasy.  reminds you of day old frozen fries.  I had the tomato basil soup.  it was more lie marinara sauce.  It was so thick. Not what i expected.  It belonged on pasta not in a bowl.  The server did not check on us to see how everything was  only to bring the check"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today at Mimi's and it was wonderful, I haven't been there in a long time  but I see now that I need to start going there again. The food was great, waitress was very nice. Can't wait to go back. Thank you."}
{"text":"This Yelper is not happy.  Subpar service and overpriced food does not make me a happy Yelper. I WILL NEVER RETURN EVER!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here before. The food is hit and miss but tonight the Hibachi Chicken was a hit."}
{"text":"The corned beef and hash is yummy! The red potatoes are just right with a light butter taste. My fave breakfast there!"}
{"text":"Great experience at Mimi's!!!! It's always great! Food was delicious as well as the sever. Mary was very attentive and friendly!!! Never went without a cold drink!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I understand that if you're over the age of 60, this is probably the place for you. But for those of us who are not baby boomers, this place leaves a LOT to be desired.
The service is sloooow- I guess they figure EVERYONE is retired but some of us actually have schedules to keep and would like our food served promptly. When the food actually arrived, it was mediocre at best and the portions were way small. The waitress seemed haggard and looked like she would rather be any where else on earth than working at this joint. So, all in all, this place is pretty horrible- slow service, tiny portions of bland food, and unfriendly servers. Go somewhere else if you're not an octogenarian."}
{"text":"This place is too popular on Sunday for breakfast.. Which is coincidentally when I like to go too. We normally wait in line for a half hour but I think its worth it. Good food. Decent prices."}
{"text":"Went to Mimi's Cafe for thanksgiving dinner. Called two weeks in advance for reservations. Called the morning of thanksgiving to verify out reservations only to find out we were not on the list. Mimi's told us they would add us to the list for our original time of 5:00 p'm.  Got there at 4:30 pm and when we checked on our reservations found out that we again were not on the list. They called the manager and I explained the whole story. He then penciled our name in for 5:00 pm and told us we would be the first 5:00 called. At this point we talked to many others and found out that they were running about an hour behind. Why not over book, where are all these people going to go?! One hour comes and goes, hubby goes to check only to have the manager tell him he doesn't have time for the hubby and turns and walks away. Finally they cleared a table for us. Turkey and stuffing were good. Rest of the meal was awful. Not with the $18 a meal. Will not go back there. The two stars are for the waitress. She was awesome."}
{"text":"I really like the food at Mimi's and I have been to this location several times. I went with several friends today and attempted to use a coupon. I had a coupon for 50% off one entree when a 2nd entree plus two beverages were ordered. They wouldn't accept the coupon because everyone but me got water. Well, it's about 111 degrees today and they were all parched. We ordered several entrees and one person ordered extra muffins. I just thought it was ridiculous that they wouldn't honor the coupon considering the amount of money that we were spending. Also, they upcharged someone else at my table for getting extra onions without mentioning it until the bill came. I really like the food, but they are so wrapped up in nickel and diming people that I guess they aren't concerned about losing repeat business."}
{"text":"What a disaster on Mother's Day. We made a 10:15 reservation weeks ago, and when making the reservation (with the manager), asked three times if the regular breakfast menu would be available and he said it would be.

Flash forward to this morning, and there is a huge line just to \"check in\" with the reservation. We arrived at 10, and when we finally got up to the desk at 10:45 (half an hour past our reservation), we were told it would be an additional hour wait. Hostess was rude and wouldn't answer our questions. There was no apology, and the hostess refused to call the manager up. When she finally did, manager refused to come to the front, instead hiding in the back instead of dealing with the mess and angry customers. This kind of disorganization is unacceptable, and not offering any apology or letting people know at the back of the line that it will take hours for their RESERVED table is absolutely unacceptable.

We finally got a table, only to be told that there is a set Mother's Day menu with all of 6 choices. We have a vegetarian in our group, and there was only one option without meat. We asked the waitress about the regular menu (because we had confirmed twice before making the reservation that it would be available today) and she said they were not set up to serve the regular menu. We asked for the manager again and yet again he refused to come to speak with us. The waitress, Laurie, was the only saving grace and acknowledged that they were unprepared and apologized for whoever told us the menu would be available. 

Needless to say, we left and will never come back. We know Mother's Day is often very busy, but management and the hostess handled the situation very poorly and offered no apologies or explanations for the sh*t show. If you can't accommodate reservations, don't offer them and screw up everyone's plans on what is supposed to be a special day."}
{"text":"I am not one that usually reviews, good, bad or ugly.  However, I am in Mesa, AZ on vacation and my wife and we decided to have Mimi's on Monday.  We enjoyed Mimi's back in Colorado.  Unfortunately, about 6 hours after having the Bacon and Blue cheese salad with chicken I started having excruciating stomach cramps.  I then spent the night not sleeping and visiting the restroom frequently, yes I got food poisoning.  Based on the other items I have been eating I am 100% sure this occurred from my meal at Mimi's.  It has now been 3 days and I am finally starting to feel like a human again.  Hopefully they are doing better with the food prep or washing there hands. YUCK"}
{"text":"Seriously poor service! After receiving our food we sat there for 25 minutes waiting for anybody who worked at the place to give us a fork as our food got cold. The manager said it wasn't acceptable that we didn't have forks and she would get them for us right away that never happened, she walked off and disappeared. Others who were sitting next to us were seated and didn't receive their drinks for over 20 minutes. The sad thing is it wasn't even busy.  Even after another manager came over apologized and comped our meal which was nice of him, we still had empty glasses of water the rest of our stay. I used to love this place and love the food here but with this service, I don't know

{"text":"Enjoyed the food and the fresh bread n rolls are good too. The French onion soup is excellent. Not alot of places that I know or like have good French onion soup. The food selection is good,alot of choices. Service a bit slow at times. But,oh well nobody's perfect. Accept me,ha."}
{"text":"It's all right.... I felt nothing too special from this place. It felt like any other joint really. Like a fancier Ihop or something or Denny's or Olive Garden. Yeah it felt like an Olive Garden. I think the food is a little better than Olive Garden. Just a little."}
{"text":"Awful. We made a reservation for 10:15 and ended up having to leave because they were an hour behind,  I get its Mother's Day but I also work in a restaurant and the reservations are first priority. I don't get to spend time with my family now because I have to leave for work. Not only did I not get to eat, I also wasted my time there. Just awful."}
{"text":"Great food selection and wide selection. They also serve alcohol in the AM! There is a full bar up front. I will be back!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Not the quickest service ever,  but the older lady server was nice.  The food: had turkey and brie sandwich=very good.  Corn chowder= very good and hardy,  but you'll be burping it up the rest of the night.  French dip: very good.  So overall,  I'd go here again,  but don't expect the best service on earth and be patient."}
{"text":"Yea, I admit it. I ate here. I even admit I like it. For a chain.

I can't believe I liked it. My first experience with Mimi's Cafe was back in Vegas, when it first opened on my side of town in Summerlin. The food and the service was deplorable. I vowed I'd never go back there, not knowing it was a chain...I should've known better.

Fast forward ten years. I'm in Arizona and I'm near the Chandler Mall. I don't want mall food. I didn't feel like In N Out and frankly, that hot dog man at Lowe's wasn't gonna cut it either.

I eyed Mimi's Cafe. Was it going to make me happy? The decor made me want to hurl. It's too busy. Too fussy, frilly, froo-froo girlie girl for me. I wanted to burn that checkered table cloth. Putting that weird plexiglass thing on top of that checkered table cloth? It made me feel like I was back at my mother's house and she would be screaming, \"COASTER!!!!!\" any time I thought about putting a glass down on any table.

Anyway, I decided to order the Turkey Pesto Ciabatta. While waiting, bread was brought to the table...but not just any kind of bread...we're talking almost like pound cake bread...like cinnamon nut spice cake. I wanted to cry. I had to eat it. HAD TO. IT MADE ME.

The Turkey Pesto Ciabatta  was heavenly. I can't believe that I had such good food. The turkey was warm, the pesto was nice...the bacon made me happy...I am still floored it was so good.

Maybe I'll have to try something else, but for now, Mimi's gets 4 stars. Sorry, no 5 stars...because my awful experience from Vegas is still forever burned into my memory."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good, but the portions are small. Friendly environment. For the price, you're better off going to cracker barrel."}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe is New Orleans themed restaurant that serves American cuisine. They offer happy hour specials all day - all glasses of wine are $5. For non-alcoholic beverage, I'd recommend the Arnold Palmer.  After placing our order, the server brought us a basket of bread which consisted of two mini baguette and two slices of banana bread. For dinner, we shared a Warm Spinach Artichoke Dip, Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad, and French Pot Roast. The Spinach Artichoke Dip was served hot and runny. It was rich and creamy. It was made with chopped kale and aged parmesan. It was served with warm tortilla chips. The Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad consisted of fresh romaine lettuce, grated Parmesan cheese, and black pepper croutons tossed in a Caesar dressing. All salads come with a baguette or muffin. There were many different types of muffins and I chose a Cranberry Orange Muffin. The French Pot Roast consisted of a buttery scoop of mashed potatoes surrounded by braised beef brisket, carrots, mushrooms, and pearl onions in a red wine shallot sauce."}
{"text":"I just ate at Mimi's for the last time. The service was less than friendly, the wait for our simple breakfast items was so slow it took us over 2 hours for our meal, and the food while sounding great on the menu was poorly executed with fair flavors. I was beyond disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service and for the price point great food.  The staff was accommodating for my wheelchair and they removed a chair for me from the table. I got pot roast and it was fantastic.  Would definitely order again.  Brother in law got breakfast tacos he said they were incredible.  My hubby got their chicken sandwich on ciabatta bread and now he wants to go back soon.  The spinach artichoke dip made my granddaughter squeal with delight. She also loved their mussels.  So far we have been very happy with the food, service, and prices for the food.  This is no James beard location but their prices are not either.  Five stars in their category for sure.  
If you like my reviews follow me on yelp."}
{"text":"I called Mimi's earlier this week to make a 9:45a reservation with the General Manager, Jim, for Mother's Day. We arrived at 9:40a and were told we needed to wait in the 30 person line before we would be able to \"check-in\".. even though we had a reservation? We waited for an hour, watching several other people hover over the hostess and \"check-in\" before anyone would acknowledge us. We watched hostesses dart back and forth behind the bar so they wouldn't have to stand at the front and answer questions. Those of us at the front of the line kept asking the hostesses to go to the back of line (which stretched out to the parking lot) so that they could tell everyone else what was going on. The hostess would roll her eyes every time this was suggested. 

What was truly disappointing was the fact that we never saw a manager come to the line and apologize for making us wait. No one had any useful information for us and they refused to give us a time-frame for when we would be seated. One staff member said \"It's like this every Mother's Day..\"  as if that should make it all okay? You would think they would have this figured out by now if it's \"like this every Mother's Day\". 

By the way, we left and went straight to PF Changs across the steeet. Not only did they seat us right away but they actually have the air conditioning running."}
{"text":"Food was okay but they change their menu too much. I like a dish but then when I return they no longer offer it. I like the bread they bring out ahead of time. You can also get muffins to go. This place is a hit or miss. I never know what I'm going to get when I come here. My server was so sweet though and always had a smile. The GM also checked in on us which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here a couple of months ago which was good. I was in town again and walk over from the local hotel for dinner.  Being by myself I asked if was ok to eat at the bar.  I received kind of a funny look for my request. At the bar I asked the person behind the counter what type of gin they had.   She had no clue and needed to go into the kitchen to ask. I decided to stick with water.  As I was sitting at the counter I noticed a stack of job applications on the customer side of the counter. After looking closely at the top one I could see the person name, address, phone number and SOCIAL SECURITY number.   What a bunch idiots leaving this info out in the open!"}
{"text":"Mimi's never fails to be a good breakfast, my experience always vary's from server to server but the food is always consistently good.  Let be clear the service is never bad, however if it is busy they may forget your juice or muffin form time to time, just ask and they always make it right."}
{"text":"Can't say enough great things about this place.  I just held my rehearsal dinner in their private dining room and it was a hit with all of our guests.  It was a last minute reservation and Marco, the manager in charge, was amazing.  He was very accommodating, helpful, and was on site making sure everything went well that night.  Ronald, our server for the night, was great.  He was quick and pleasant.  Thank you both for making my rehearsal dinner a success.  I appreciate it."}
{"text":"As an Americanized French cafe, it's not bad, but my time in Paris ruined me for life when it comes to restaurants that attempt to be authentically French.  

The turkey and Brie melt concept was great, but with only one slice of Brie and a smaller than expected portion size, I was a little disappointed with the execution.  Taste was good, but at the risk of sounding like a snob, it really didn't compare to Parisian cafe fare.  

My advice?  Trim down the menu substantially to focus more on a few items and get fresher ingredients if you're going to imitate the French cafe experience."}
{"text":"Marco is by far the best manager. He saw that i wasnt to happy with my order and he took care if everything. He is such an amazing manager. Made absolutely no excuse for the mistakes made by the kitchen staff. Instead he went into the kitchen and remade my entire order. He is one of the reasons we will continue to visit this Mimis. 
Alma was pretty attentive and also made no excuses for the kitchen staff. She kept our coffee cups full and did suggest a truly delicious breakfast and muffin choice. 
Stop by this Mimi's and have a cup of delicious coffee and try the buttermilk muffin or honey bran muffin."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday, place was not busy at all, food came out fast and cold."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and efficient service...food was meh okay...place was pretty empty, we did have an early dinner tho... Had a brownie Sunday..they were kinda stingy on the ice cream...not the best but not the worst either...oh and creepy music playing in the background!"}
{"text":"Clean place. No so crow it for a Sunday morning. Lots of tables. Large choice in menu."}
{"text":"I ordered a Sante Fe omelette with red potatoes and a chocolate chip banana muffin. The omelette wasn't spicy hot at all. I mainly tasted onions. It tasted ok but not what I expected. It was suppose to have jalapeños in it, but I didn't taste them. The muffin was good. I do like the atmosphere here. Waitress Mary did an amazing job!!"}
{"text":"Apprehensive breakfast visit due to the reviews of this location. Maybe it's a timing thing. I like to avoid crowds so I eat at off times. 9am in a weekday was perfect. Ample parking meant few patrons. I've been to Mimi's previously at other locations. Delicious choices of breakfasts if I'm not in the mood for my eggs, bacon, & hash browns (which I can have at least once a day for every day of the week). Today I had salmon Benedict. So happy with my choice. Loved the saltiness of the capers with the hollandaise sauce. Eggs done perfectly runny. English muffin held its own with all the oozy goodness. No onions for me. Crisp tiny whole & halved potatoes accompanied everything perfectly. Also order was the Santa Dr omelette. The 3 eggs contained all the tasty goodness inside rather well. The salsa had a good spot of unexpected heat. His came with a muffin which I almost was envious of while we waited for our meals. The strong dark coffee kept me distracted else I would have stolen a piece. Given the serious conversation in had a pleasant visit here. The waitress was attentive but overly intrusive. Atmosphere was tranquil till the lunch crowd meandered in filling the empty tables, about 1130ish. 

I am in between giving a 5 star rating. It was great yet not quite perfect. A 4.5 if it is possible."}
{"text":"It was an average experience. I figured I'd give it 4 stars bc the server was very nice. They are staffed so sparse that no one greeted me not only did I wait a long while I had to ahemm ahemm.. hellooooo.. yoo-hoo omg was involved. So yeah."}
{"text":"I have been to Mimi's Cafe several times. Each time the service has been fantastic. The food is delicious. I haven't been disappointed once."}
{"text":"This is now the third time I have been to Mimi's. It's been awesome each time. I've been lucky to have good servers. Mrs. Mary was on my second visit having been in the industry for 15 years she knew how to handle my needs, give me space but also when to engage as well. This time I have Pam and boy! Does she have energy!  She also had attended to all my needs and given me the space I desire. As I've watched her move I am impressed with how she makes all her customers feel like number one . Good job to both ladies. The food had been amazing. I'm trying to get more omega 3 into my diet so I went with the salmon omelette. Salty at first but give the flavors time to soak in and it's golden. The breakfast potatoes well seasoned. I'm not a big potato fan but these are delicious. All and all go good place. Will be coming more often"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to MiMi's on Alma School & Souther in Mesa for Thanksgiving now going on about 8 yrs. So I completely have something to compare it with. Years ago the portions were large and you had actual leftovers just like you should on Thanksgiving. They gave you a huge slice of pie or yummy bread pudding. That was then. The bread pudding size diminished immensely over the years and now it got so small they don't even offer it. NOW, the price has understandably risen, I get that. BUT!!!! The portions are half, very scrawny and seem to lack the quality they used to have. The pumpkin pie was so small and had this crumb stuff  topping like they put on top of apple pie, it really took away from the pie not to mention how tiny the piece was the crumb topping was made to be half the piece, ick. The pecan pie size was just as tiny. They drizzled this gross carmel topping on it, never did that before either. I don't know what the heck they are thinking but I once thought of MiMi's as an awesome place to eat. Not any more. We are really considering changing where we go on Thanksgiving we were so displeased this year."}
{"text":"Not bad in a pinch, but only in a pinch. 

I find Mimi's to be a bit  . . . boring. The food really isn't bad or good, and the service is equally non-descript. Pretty inexpensive during lunch, so it has that going for it. 

Ok, I guess non-descript was the operative word here, because I'm all out."}
{"text":"I'm wary of anything that tries to pass itself off as \"Nawlins\" style food.  Mimi's may be a chain, but for all that, the food is quite good and reasonably priced.  If you're feeling the urge on a Sunday, let me recommend you call ahead for takeout.  They do a wonderful job and it will travel at least a good 15 minutes without becoming too cold.  Hey if you want to go spend your time waiting with all the other people in their \"I just got out of church\" outfits, go right ahead.  I'd rather book it to a park than stand around waiting for my name to be called.

You'll find the usual heart attacks on a plate for breakfast which is my favorite thing to order here.  Personally, I'm a dirty little whore for the Pain Perdu.  Is it the french toast? The cream cheese? The marmalade?  Taken separately, any one of these is a temptation that can be resisted.  Throw them together, and I would totally stick check your grandmother and mine if they were between me and my Pain Perdu.  Hyperbole? Perhaps, but I'm telling you -  This stuff is love on a plate.  LOVE.  Get it inside of you.  It will make you giddy.  Better looking, smarter, charming, successful.  Or at the very least fat.

I could talk about the deliciousness of the Crab Cake Benedict, The Breakfast Quiche, the fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juice, but I won't do it.  That would only distract you from the Pain Perdu.  Lunch and dinner are acceptable.  I like the salads, and the frisco burger, but there's nothing that really gets me all hot and bothered the way the Pain Perdu does.

Say it with me, \"I'll have the Pain Perdu\""}
{"text":"the manager of this place I believe his name is Jim he is a jerk, treated me like I was a nobody and that his staff was right and I was wrong , I came here for my college masters graduation lunch and they messed up 6 out of 7 meals and expected me to pay when they were inedible . The staff talked about our table when they thought we couldn't here even though it was only a couple of feet away in the kitchen. They were disrespectful and ride in every aspect of the words I will never go back to this location again go to a different location then the one on the 101 and chandler blvd for your own good!!"}
{"text":"Mimi's is always a good bet. Good, hearty meals that will satisfy most palates. This is the millionth time I've been, as it is a fave for family half-way meeting breakfasts.

The restaurant is always clean, and the staff friendly. I overlook the fake, half-assed \"Bonjour\" ( bon-jure lol) as I walk in the door.

The menu has much to offer. However, having recently adopted a plant-based, mostly vegan diet, I will tell you that your options are extremely limited, especially at breakfast. I had the Banana Brulee Oatmeal, which was plentiful and tasty. I will add that brulee means burnt cream. This was not that. There was no scorched/caramelized sugar, and there was a split banana on top with what might have been a grill mark? It was just oatmeal, and I added strawberries and brown sugar, foregoing the cream/milk. Very good oatmeal. I stole a few baby breakfast potatoes from my husband, and they were great...seasoned well and cooked thoroughly.

The kids had chicken and waffles, and classic Benedict. Both said that their meals were fantastic. They didn't talk much, which is a good sign. 

Negatively, my water was not filled much, and I wasn't asked if I needed more hot water for my tea. I didn't grab the server either, so it's part my fault. My tea cup was filthy, with coffee drips all over it. I believe that it's not too much to ask for the server to be sure the service is clean before sending it out, especially having been a server myself. I would be embarrassed and appalled.

All in all, Mimi's is a nice place for a good meal, at a decent price."}
{"text":"I'm docking a star because they have REMOVED my favorite item from the menu!!! 

The Huevos con Tortillas is no longer available (see pics) 
Why Oh Why would they take that away from me!!!! 

I'm so sad right now!"}
{"text":"Three stars and not because of the food. Three stars because of the poor service. Too bad because this is the time to be too busy. If you were waiting for a table anywhere else you didn't need to. Mimi's had plenty of open tables. The house wine was pretty good for the price. If I go back I will order the wine again."}
{"text":"Terrible - lying hostess.  If the wait is 2 hours.. Then say so.  If it's 3 1/2 hours.. Then say so.  But don't tell people on your wait list they are going to be seated in only 15 minutes.  Congratulations on your busy day, but our time is valuable.  One bad experience with dishonest employees is all I need to never ever return."}
{"text":"I often stop here for lunch when I am in the area of West Mesa. I love their Cobb Salad...chopped very fine with lots of blue cheese crumbles and avocado (my favorite parts of a Cobb!) I have them 'toss' it for me...much easier to eat that way. It comes with your choice of muffin...and they are so HUGE I save it for breakfast the next day! 
I also go to the Mimi's in Chandler...just as good. They also have good weekend breakfast/brunches. I like that their only advertisement is 'word of mouth' and the word is...yummy!"}
{"text":"Always a fan of Mimi's!  Sorry it took so long to write this review.  No matter which location we visit, the food is always top notch!  Breakfast is our family favorite and the pain purdue is too good for words!  I get a patty melt for lunch whenever I can and they do it up right everytime!  Try it on grilled sourdough bread with their signature honeymustard - dip the patty melt in the dressing and .................YUM!  Service is always great and we'll be there again this weekend!"}
{"text":"First timer here:

Was my first go, as I was excited for the stuffed french toast, assuming it was all day breakfast. They do have all day breakfast, but it was only about 5 items I think :(

Anyhow, I'm not picky. Ordered the Mushroom Brie burger  (medium well). It was ok. But it wasn't medium well (see picture). And half of it tasted burnt on the edges. The $5 red house wine was good though. My gf thought the Cobb salad was ok. Decent. The soup she got with it wasn't very hot at all. A tad bit over room temp...still tasted good though.

Anyhow, I've still heard things about this place. Maybe it's the breakfast that sets it apart. I'll probably try breakfast from here one day, and edit this review possibly. 

Customer service was great though, if that means anything to you! :)

2 stars = me not really excited to go back."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast. Great food. Amazing service. Always stop here for breakfast with family."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner 9/5/14
My bacon avocado sour dough  burger was good and their hand made fries are excellent
My girlfriends onion soup was questionable at best and they were nice enough not to charge us and gave us 2 blueberry muffins.

My girlfriends steak and fries was good as well
DOMONIQUE was a great waitress!

Not so good......the place smells like an old folks home!!"}
{"text":"This place is quite cute. The interior seating spot is comfortable with the high ceilings. We arrived around 3pm for dinner and the place wasn't as busy. All and all the meal was good. It was cooked simply, not very complex in flavours. So if your not very adventurous and like to play it safe in your food choices this would be a good place to go. Our waitress was really nice, got our food out quick and gave us some muffins to go. Very nice"}
{"text":"It was our first time there, and I can say that there will be others for sure. The food, service, place and staff were amazing! The waitress and the manager who talked to us were very kind and friendly! 

We've ordered the contest winner pork chop, and my fiancé ordered the atlantic salmon, along with spinach dip as an appetizer and creme brûlée cheesecake as dessert, and it was delicious!

I totally recommend this place. It was one of the best experiences we had. And you feel very especial as a customer, because they don't advertise the place (as the manager said to us), relying on customers satisfaction as a marketing strategy."}
{"text":"I like the bloody Mary's and sangria. The salads are pretty good. Very little vegetarian or vegan selections. Always good service and it's always clean and pleasant."}
{"text":"Just stopped by here quickly today to grab some food to go for my grandmother. She loves this place! I was greeted warmly by Norma the hostess who quickly helped me get my grandmas order on the way. 

When I went to the bar to pay a very kind lady with pig tails asked if I wanted to have a seat and enjoy some water or tea as I waited. I politely declined but was very grateful that she asked. Between her and the hostess my quick trip to Mimi's was great and because of their service I will be back to dine in with them in the near future. 

Thank you lovely folks at Mimi's."}
{"text":"I made a reservation yesterday for 12 of us. It's fathers Day so I was pleased to hear they would accommodate. The manager Eddy took my reservation and nothing but praise to her. We arrived at 10:05 am and were immediately seated. Everyone was friendly and the service was terrific. The food was good. All this in spite of them having a very busy Father's Day morning. 

The manager that took care of our reservation yesterday turns out to be the same lady that some years ago served our Friday morning networking group. She is just a sweetheart. Thanks to Mimi's in Chandler for providing a great experience this morning."}
{"text":"Stopped on here for breakfast on a weekday before work. It was okay. We walked in and there was not a hostess or any one around. We finally flagged down a waitress and she seated us. Our waitress was not very friendly. She did not smile and talked in a monotone voice. I ordered the banana oatmeal. It came with a side of brown sugar and milk. 
The oatmeal was warm and typical. It came with caramelized bananas on top.
I thought the decor was upscale funky. Our waitress, although not friendly was attentive. When we told her it was our first time there, she brought out 2 complimentary muffins to go. I feel the place is pricey for what it is."}
{"text":"It breaks my heart to give Mimis 1 star, but they earned it. No wonder they are going out of business. Black Friday evening and there was only a few cars in the lot... good we thought there wont be an hour wait like everywhere else... The service was SLOOOOOOOWWWW. The soup- that the server warned me was HOT, was only hot on top and sent back. Our food took 30 min to come out and there was only 3 tables in the whole place. My well done burger was RAW in the middle, sent back, and i had to ask if it was ever coming after everyone else was finished eating. The manager brought it, apologized, took 50% off our bill and gave us a TERRIBLE dessert. Lol Why does it make me sad to say it was awful, because this used to be my FAVORITE place to go... When my middle daughter was born, my favorite burger (the french quarter it used to be called) MY daddy drove a long way to get and bring to me in the hospital for my first meal. :("}
{"text":"Up in the air? We had great service but my dish the grilled shrimp pasta let a lot to b desired. The shrimp tasted as if it came out of a bag from the freezer. Honestly I wish they still had the new orleans creole pasta. It was also a tad warm in there. We may go back, it wasn't a bad experience, just the heat and dish. I will def get something different if we return."}
{"text":"Love the French Onion soup and carrot raisin muffins here.
Today we came after three and you could say the entire staff was out to lunch.
We eventually seated ourselves at the bar, got our own menus too, was eventually greeted by someone who offered to get us drinks but again we were waiting for a server.
Did finally get service and our order placed and meal delivered in a timely manner.
I had quiche with soup and a muffin and my son had the soup and sandwich.  
Meal was fine as we had anticipated.
Bummed they don't have a muffin included in the soup & salad option."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Had the French toast with orange creme. Absolutely delicious. Excellent service. Only minor ding is I'm pretty sure they brought me regular sausage instead of the turkey sausage."}
{"text":"I took my 12-year-old grandson here on Saturday he got the Apple and bacon waffles that came with the side of eggs and bacon I could not believe he ate the entire thing but said it is now his favorite restaurant I got the veggie omelette and it was awesome we will be back"}
{"text":"On 4/9/16 my family and I went in to Mimi's Cafe we were told it would be 5 to ten minutes before we could be seated 25 minutes later we left after they had seated at least five other families. We will never be back nor will anyone we know. Your service is abhorrent and the manager saw us waiting at least three times."}
{"text":"Have not been to a mimis for a year or two but I suggest the blue cheese and walnut salad. You can't go wrong there. They have a good variety and cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was the WORST place to eat. We had reservations for Easter, but still had to wait an additional 30 minutes. One of my children is tube fed and they tried to tell me that I wasn't allowed to bring in outside food...seriously?!?! Then, after we ordered our food, the servers SPILLED some gravy on my husbands shirt and surely ruined it. Didn't even say sorry or offer to comp his meal or bring something to clean up the mess. The food was less than good, they were out of the dessert I ordered (and didn't tell me until after we waited for 20 minutes) and on top of it all, our waiter knowingly overcharged us $20. When my husband called him out on it, the waiter stammered like he was trying to back up his steps. I do not recommend this place, I wish there were an option for no stars, because they definitely don't deserve the one I gave them."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and it was fantastic. It was our first time here and they were kind enough to give us 2 croissants to go. Loved the French toast and breakfast tomatoes. Made sure our bacon was done to our liking. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Hsd not been here for a long while, but received a coupon (first warning) for the revised menu. I will say I am not a fan. The idea here is they went back to a more \"traditional\" french menu. The names to all the items are in French, not sure that's going to win anyone over. If anything it pushed people to dishes they are familiar and comfortable with, which then leads to the kitchen running out, ex. The Turkey dinner. I believe they are missing the mark over all a d it may be some time again before I return."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Quiche Lorraine and white peach mimosa for brunch. The crust on the quiche was buttery and flaky and the mimosa was also tasty."}
{"text":"This was one of those times that you just wonder what in the world? The service was below average to say the best. I won't get into details except to say that I actually had to get up and get water for the table and had other tables try to flag me down jokingly but seriously asking if they could have water too. At the very end we talked to the manager and explained what happened. He was a young kid and really couldn't care less. I said that's fine will just post it on Yelp and he said OK. Even an apology would've been great."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since we came to Mimi's, this one.  The last time we came it was with my family, a large party of over 10 people.  And if I recall last time, the food came out sporadically and some people didn't get their food until others were nearly finished.  Thought that was a fluke, but this is now the 2nd time with a large party - our party was 14 people this time.

I don't know the name of our server, but he was a tall, Caucasian man probably in his 20s/30s with a short man ponytail.  The manager on duty was Jim Dekker.  I smiled at him as we were going to our table, which is in a more private area.  No one else was seated in that area, just my family.

In fact, the restaurant was not busy.  It was about 6 pm on a Saturday (18-Feb-2017).  It had been raining and I don't know why so few people on a Saturday night.  Our server got us our drinks in a reasonable timeframe.  Most of my family is comprised of Asian people, with the exception of my Caucasian sister-in-law and my husband, a Colombian man.

We ordered appetizers and that came quickly.  We ordered our food and that was not an issue.  We waited for the entrees to come and they did for most of the table.  Maybe 4 of us didn't get our food, but then the other 2 people's stuff came.  My husband and I waited and waited for our food.  Probably more than 20 minutes had gone by AFTER the first 10 people at our table got their food and 10 minutes after the other 2 got their's.  Still no food.

Finally our food came, but it was probably a good 25 minutes or so.  We were really hungry and my husband was really looking forward to the steak and fries he ordered.  Not once in those 25 minutes or so did our server come to us and tell us what the delay in our food was or anything.  He was nowhere in our area to be found.

But, the food finally came.  My husband had ordered his steak well done.  He said he wanted NO PINK.  I ordered a pot roast.  The pot roast was somewhat cold and the broccoli was cold, too.  The scalloped potatoes were hot, though.  So, my food had been sitting around for awhile before I actually got the food.  My husband's steak was close to the RARE side.  

We motioned for the server who happened to be in the bar-ish area to come.  We said that we ordered WELL DONE and as you can see from the pink and the blood oozing out a little, it was nothing close to WELL DONE.  He gave us this look and without apologizing (we know it's not his fault personally, but apologizing for the cook), he said he'd take it back to have them cook it better.

We waited at least another 10 minutes.  My husband is super hungry by this time and some people at our table were already done with their dinner.  The server finally came back with the  steak and fries.  My husband cut into it and though it did not have any blood ooze from it, it was still about 1/2 pink - so Medium Rare.  Nothing close to WELL DONE.  He said he no longer wanted the steak.

I told my husband to order something else instead since the cook cannot be competent enough to understand what WELL DONE means.  It means NO PINK!!  My husband ordered a mushroom burger instead.  Waited another 15 minutes or so and it was now nearly 8 pm.  He's starved.  Everyone has finished dinner and still his dinner hadn't arrived.  Our server didn't come back.

By this time, my husband and I are irate.  I feel bad for my husband as well as everyone else at our table.  The server NEVER once apologizes for anything.  My husband decided that he no longer wanted ANY food from Mimi's and we just wanted to leave.  Oh, and this was a birthday celebration dinner, too.

I left the area we were in in search of our server.  Couldn't be found, but the manager, Jim Dekker was.  I explained the situation.  He looked at me as if he really didn't care.  He asked me what I wanted him to do about it.  I thought this response sounded sarcastic and indifferent.  And I'm sure he could see the look of frustration and anger on my face.  

Then he responded by telling me he wasn't going to charge me for my meal nor my husband's.  Well, thank you for not charging us for my husband's meal that he never got.  We really appreciate that.  And, he said he would give us 2 free entrees at our next visit.

At some later time after the birthday cake was served, the manager went over to my sister, NOT me.  I don't know what he said to my sister and he gave her a card.  For one, my sister isn't married to my husband.  My husband is Latino.  Most of the table is ASIAN and we LOOK ASIAN.  My husband LOOKS LATINO.  Maybe to Mr. Dekker all Asians look alike.

My husband said to his defense, though he was upset, \"You and your sister do look similar.\"  Okay.  I'll give him that, but our server, unless he's really so not observant, could see that my husband looks different than the Asians.  AND, he was sitting at the end of the table next to me.  The manager and server should have been apologizing to my husband.  Why he was talking to my sister, idk?"}
{"text":"Puppy face pancakes for the little miss and coffee for mom and a full bar at 9 am for dad. Really can't complain about that kind of setup!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Mimi's Cafe many times at our West Valley location and it's been one of my favorites.  my sister and I stopped by this particular location while in the area.  The 2 stars are for our delightful waitress-- pleasant, attentive and professional in every way-- the food on the other hand--terrible-- my sister ordered the 7 meatball appetizer and side salad-- they gave her a 1/2 filled cup of ranch dressing--she wondered why they skimped and when she requested more-- she was told they were all out--really? Out of ranch dressing at 5pm?  Her meatballs tasted mealy--pre cooked and reheated--my sandwich was supposed to be a mushroom burger--a slice of white bread-- cut in half with cold mushrooms--no garnish and cold cheese.  We decided to share a piece of cheesecake-- Tasted like the Jello,box no bake kind-- very disappointing meal-- unsure if Mimi's has lowered their quality or was it just the chef at this location-- would never go back there.  We will have to check out our west side location to see."}
{"text":"I saw an Instagram promo and thought I'd take advantage of it even though itsnot real8close to me. I got the baked brie for an appetizer and it was delicious! I definitely recommend it and thanks to the Instagram coupon I saved on my entree."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate here for breakfast a few weeks ago on a fluke  and it was deelish! Really hit the spot. Coming back for breakfast soon:)

The Lattes were heavenly and the second is 1/2 price! I wanted to try one of everything on that menu but.. we decided on Eggs Florentine Bene and she had the Belgian Waffle w/whipped cream and Berries Scrambled eggs and  Turkey Sausage.. Service this Sat morn was great and we felt comfortable and had a great time together talking laughing and ENJOYING our meal together..

Last night I took all my daughters and Grand baby and we had a few happy hour items. The Artichoke and Brie fondue was tasty as were the Beef Sliders. The kids meal is a great  price for such a large portion and came with  a \"snack\" to  keep granddaughter happy until all our  food arrived together. 

Mediterranean Pasta was enjoyed by one,Roasted Chicken Crepes made my oldest daughter say MM and Chicken Brie Dijon wasn't to my one daughters liking so they happily replaced it with the Chicken pot pie she reordered.  The Demi Bread Pudding w/ whiskey sauce was rich and warm and everyone enjoyed a few bites. 
The portions are large be prepared for  take home and a meal for the f
following day.
 
Mimis is like a high end french decor Coco's and the food is fine but not like real Bistro or an authentic New Orleans dinner.
We had a nicely priced and tasteful meal and good family times , nothing to complain about :)

I have been back for Breakfast 2 more times and its always deliciously awesome! NOT LIKE COCO'S"}
{"text":"For Thanksgiving, we couldn't find a restaurant that still had buffet reservations available. So, a week before Thanksgiving I ordered a complete Thanksgiving dinner package from Mimi's café. Included in the package was a 10-12 pound brined turkey (fully cooked), Home style real mashed potatoes, gravy, fresh green bean casserole, sweet potato casserole, two loaves of carrot bread and cranberry sauce. My whole family loved it! Everything was moist and tender, all the toppings came with the meal, and the pumpkin pie was outstanding. It only took an hour and a half to warm up the turkey and fixings. We like this so much, we ordered it again for Christmas. And for $89, we feel like we got a great bargain. Much better than a local less grocery store establishment, famous for its yuppie clientele, that we used the previous year. And also much cheaper."}
{"text":"I have to say, this place has wonderful people. We were greeted warmly and were seated fairly quickly considering how busy they were. Our server, Alma, was absolutely fantastic. 

That being said, I've never paid so much for such a mediocre meal. The food was what you'd expect to find at an assisted living center. It was so bland and soft textured, you'd think they went out of their way to deliberately remove flavor. The price was way out of line with the quality of the food, I've paid as much for a much more enjoyable meal at Longhorn's at the other side of the mall. 

Overall, huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Been going to Mimis for Thanksgiving for several years and...for the most part..have enjoyed it very much.  Yesterday's experience has absolutely turned us off to Mimi's.  There were four of us.  Didn't even get rolls until the dinner arrived. Green beans and sweet potatoes were sent back by one because they were cold.  What came back was still cold, and now the sweet potatoes lacked the pecans.  Turkey was not hot on anybody's plate and ice cold on another. That one meal was comp'd, but...
The final insult was what they called pumpkin pie.  Not traditional as most know it, and the serving--as they call it--was a sliver.  
Needless to say, we have now checked them off our preferred list of dining spots.  Prices have gone up, and the quality and quantity have gone way way down.  So long, Mimi's."}
{"text":"Good food.  Their bread and muffins get five stars. I gave it three stars because I'm not a super huge fan of all the times on their menu.  Could be me.  the food is really good, but it's just a personal opinion.  I guess back in the day, I ordered a turkey sandwich here that was dry as a bone... sorta sticks.

I hear their breakfasts are out of this world.. maybe i'll go there and redo my review."}
{"text":"Classy apple juice, fluffy croissants, kid friendly, timely and good service. Would recommend for breakfast not dinner."}
{"text":"To start, I don't think Mimi's was prepared for the crowd they got on thanksgiving. We had made a reservation for a 3:00 pm turkey dinner in hopes that there wouldn't be much wait for our party of 4. Little did we know hundreds of others did the same thing and many more walked in placing their names on a list. The little wait we expected turned into a 30-45 minute wait. 

After we were finally seated, the wait began again. Waitress and after waitress walked past us ignoring our table. No water were brought and not even a \"we'll be right with you\". So we finally got up and approached the manager after a food runner was kind enough to bring us waters. The manager went around and asked the 2 waitresses working all 4/5 tables surrounding us and none of them took responsibility or seemed to want our table. Little did we know this was a blessing in disguise. 

Monique was given our table even though it seemed her section was no where near our table. She turned the whole meal around. She was attentive, kind, threw in some jokes and really was a sweetheart. 

Given that it was thanksgiving, the meal was good for it not being my home cooked meal but it was pretty tasty. Also the serving size was huge which allowed to reach that \"over capacity\" feeling everyone deserves in turkey day. Mimi's is a good choice if you are looking for a holiday meal. But on any other day try and get Monique as your server. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I like coming to Mimi's because it is owned by Bob Evans, which we do not have here in the desert. The food is traditional comfort food and always good. The highlight for me is the carrot raisin bread. I never order dessert because the bread could quality own its own as a dessert.

I ordered the meatloaf sandwich - it came sliced in half with a side of onion rings. I could only eat the one half. Nice portions. I noticed on the menu a drink called Pom Zero. That was new to me - pomegranate juice mixed with Sprite Zero. It could a nice spritzer - and I had about 6 of them. 

The service was very good. Our waitress was always there to see if we wanted anything and the drinks kept flowing. At times I had half a glass and one in reserve. I also like the New Orleans deco and the feel of the restaurant. I didn't notice it on the menu this time, but in the past I ordered the grilled vegetable stack sandwich - that is incredible! If it's there, give it a shot!!"}
{"text":"To be honest, the food wasn't that great. The service however was on point! Nemi was very attentive and had the best attitude! She always had a smile on her face and made sure our drinks and bread were full. She even offered us to-go drinks at check out which made my whole day. Such a little thing can make a huge impact. I would consider trying this place again just because of her :))"}
{"text":"Never again will I go to Mimis Cafe. First we get arrive and no one was at the hostess station and we went unacknowledged for about 5 minutes. Then we ask for a booth but I guess the host didn't hear our multiple request. After being seated we were ignored for about 10 minutes before someone finally came and got our drink order. We eventually got to order food and the food was underwhelming. I ordered the chicken and waffles and my wife ordered the chicken pot pie. My waffle didn't suck but my chicken was tasteless and dry. My wife's chicken pot pie was bland. Overall the experience was bad and not worth the price take in count that we had a buy one get one free coupon. We expected more."}
{"text":"Chose Mimi's Café to handle my parents' 60th wedding anniversary party for our family, mostly because I knew that there would be something on the menu for everyone to enjoy.  I was SOOOOO pleased!  We had a private room and the management was incredibly accommodating!  The service was beyond outstanding, and my parents were overjoyed!  MANY thanks to Mimi's Café for making this event a HUGE success for us.  We're forever grateful!!"}
{"text":"This place is very good!   I went with family and among the orders were the Mac and Cheese, Classic Ruben, French Dip, and slow roasted turkey.  All meals came out great and timely!   The desert looked great but we were all too stuffed to have any.    The meals are a little pricy, however, you get a lot of food.    Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We were back at Mimi's Cafe and I must admit after my last review in 2014, we had been back a few times.  At times service was good and other times service not so good.  I am reviewing our last experience.

It seems the food is fairly consistent and that's good. Service is different.  It is inconsistent.  This time there were four of us and Frances was our server.  If we had exceptional service, I would boost about it at Mimi's.  In the same breath  I will say this was about the worst service we have had at a Mimi's or any restaurant in a while.

We were seated fairly quickly.  However, it was a little bit before our server finally arrived to take our drink order.  Then, it was longer yet until she showed up again to take our food order.  It seemed forever until our food arrived.  We didn't realize that she must have forgotten to even put the food order in until we looked at the time on our bill that it was given to the kitchen.  We had a mighty long wait to have our breakfast brought to us.  Then, she never checked back to see how our food was or even refill our drinks until they were empty.  Her mannerism was curt, never friendly.  Obviously, our tip reflected it but even that was too much when we realized the kitchen didn't get the order until we had sat there for a mighty long time wondering why it was taking so long.  Terrible server.

We're thinking this Mimi's is one to cross off our list."}
{"text":"My rating is based upon the pushy server a few weeks ago.  It was roughly 8pm and because I was the last table for the waitress, she first implied and then directly told me to speed things up.  At mid-meal she brought a plastic container (with lid) of iced tea as if I ordered a tea to go (with half my food still on the plate).  Bringing the check, she asked me to pay immediately because she was leaving------I said \"Don't you close at 10pm?\"  My guess is she is probably a good server and very efficient, but if she is starting to boss customers around, then it's going to send people away who may not come back (there are a lot of places to eat)....."}
{"text":"We always liked the Mimis is Ahwatukee. Since closing we tried this one. Good luck getting a table. Even with very few people in the restaurant you'll wait to be seated. We won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"I had the most unbelievable experience here just tonight. I went in and stood at the host stand to place an order to go. I had Stood there for 10 min. Not one person in sight except one server helping her tables and she didn't even look my way once. After 10 min of standing there I, even though I was standing in the store, called them. When they answered and asked \"how can I help you\" I said \"hi I've been standing up front for about 10. Can somebody please come and help me?\" And they said \"oh sure\" and hung up. I still stood there for 3 min until someone came out of the kitchen to help me. When someone came out and ask \"how can I help you\" I asked if I could place an order Togo and she said \"oh well we don't really do in person Togo orders it's usually when people call.\" So I'm standing there confused... Do you want me to step out in the parking lot and call you and tell you what I want over the phone??? Is it not aloud for me what I'd like to eat in person? Meanwhile, I'm waiting to place an order for some muffins Togo, not even food they need prepare and cook, a party of 3 had been standing there waiting for about 8 min before anyone even looked at them. It was so weird. Some of the worst service I had ever had."}
{"text":"Wish I could write a review. The menu looked tempting online and I took immediately to the Ham, Egg, and Swiss waffles. There is a location very nearby but I have never been. So I called for takeout breakfast. After the hostess answered the phone I was put on hold for 8 minutes before I finally hung up. Nice try but I won't bother with Mimi's again."}
{"text":"Mimi's Food is always wonderful, the Service is Impeccable, the location is great for me, and as an eClub Member the Savings are great too."}
{"text":"We went in and everything wasn't so great, so we gave the manager a call and he said to come back another day, that it wasn't usually like that and something had to have been off. 
We went back in and the food and the service was amazing. Thanks guys for fixing the issue and providing a genuine dinner service."}
{"text":"We drove all the way from Ahwatukee Foothills to go to Mimi's because we miss the one we once had in Ahwatukee. The experience was horrible. My daughter's chicken was burnt, my son only got 1/2 his food and I didn't receive my order until my kids we almost done with their food. I asked for my waitress who was busy so I than asked for the manager. She wouldn't come out until she brought out our food and then blamed our server. I don't know how it's the server's fault that the food wasn't prepared correctly. She said she would take care of it. Well it got worse from there. The food that I waited for was cold, she did offer to recook everything but we had already waited so long I refused. When I got my check I was shocked to see I was being charged for our food. Burnt chicken, runny eggs, cold food and a nasty attitude from the manager, NO WAY! I told her flat out I shouldn't have to pay for our food and I would be happy to pay for our drinks. She again argued and stormed off like a 2 year old. I WILL NEVER go back to this place and can see why the place was empty. Note to manager: not good customer service to argue with customers. We clearly weren't happy and you could have turned this whole thing around if you would have been more understanding. Shame on you and your horrible customer service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular visitor to Mimi's, both for breakfast and for dinner, but lately I can't stand to go there. Too many poor experiences have colored what good things I have to say with them.

The GOOD: 
The food is typically and consistently good. Some of the gems on the menu are the turkey dinner, the onion soup, and the scallops with mushroom ravioli. The bread -- carrot walnut, dinner rolls, and occasionally banana -- are a treat.

The BAD:
The service is horrific. A couple of waitresses are ok, but most are slow. They regularly screw up orders and make us wait forever for a first greeting at the table or a drink refill.

The seating is also frequently a problem. We (two adults) have been seated at a small table between two big tables full of screaming kids, despite the restaurant being only half full. The half-moon shaped tables are also very uncomfortable because they are too big for the booth space. You are guaranteed to end up sitting on (and pulling out) the too-long table cloths.

Some of the food is an issue. They rely too heavily on Thousand Island dressing (which is awful in a breakfast sandwich). Other dishes do not have all their ingredients revealed on the menu -- such as green onions, which my boyfriend hates, and nuts, which I can't eat.

Overall, Mimi's is ok for an occasional meal during a quiet hour, but I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"This place seems like an upscale Coco's.   Similar look, bake goods on display on the way in (muffins instead of pies), and a couple of items on menu same as Coco's (Sam Adams Beer Batter Fish n Chips).

Compared with most Coco's in Phx area this place is cleaner, newer.   My problem was the food.   All four items we ordered were bad.  My kids got \"flatbread pizza\" and it was nasty, they could not eat it, slimy and falling apart.   My wife got some kinda pasta dish, they forgot the shrimp and brought out later, it was not good.  My french dip was pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"I was there for a Dinner Seminar by a Doctor. At the Entrance everyone was asked what salad they wanted. Dinner was Salad.
Anyway I chose the Salmon. The Salmon was the last to be served. I had eaten almost half of it when I found a hair in my salad. Just got so fed up of it & moved it aside. I did want to eat anymore, even though I was very hungry. 
On my way out I told one of the servers about it & she called her Manager. The Manager apologized & asked me if I wanted a Muffin to take home with me. Really??????
Did she think I said there was a hair, to get a Muffin? I baked muffins this morning & I have enough at home. They seriously need to get things sorted. I am still feeling sick at the thought of it & want to throw up.
Going to bed with no dinner, as I don't feel good at all."}
{"text":"Visited 4/21/2018
First off this review is between 3 and 4 Stars.  It's a very nice and clean place here in Mesa Az. The staff was very nice and helpful.  This is also a very busy establishment with a bit of wait time before our food arrives.
The breakfast was tasty and plated nicely.  Our only two complaints were they messed up the order for one of our party with the wrong dish and she had to wait till the rest of us were close to being finished before her eggs Benedict arrived.  The second mistake was one of us ordered cheese on her scrambled-eggs and they didn't do that so another wait for the proper dish came.  Third thing was my omelet and potato's were hardly warm.  So that's why Only a 3 Star Rating .
Worth a try if you have plenty of time.
Enjoy"}
{"text":"This was my first time to this Mimis. My only regret was that it took me so long to go. I had heard from a coworker about their delicious breakfast, which I have still not tried, but my wife and I went for dinner. The service was exceptional, especially the manager, Jim. Our server was also very attentive and between our server, the manager, and our food our visit was exceptional. I ordered the garlic brick chicken and it was delicious. The only part of it I did not like was the chicken was still on the bone. It was a half chicken served with cheesy potatoes au gratin and a side salad. The portions were just the right size. I also ordered a cup of their French onion soup and highly recommend it. The bread basket was also delicious. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The server came to table to take our order and drop off the check. The food was tasteless. 2 families left after waiting 15 minutes without even being greeted by a server. My family and I will never return and do not recommend this restaurant. It's over priced and the food is not worth it. It only made it worse that the servers were inattentive then they blamed it on the cook. Just an FYI the cook has nothing to do with how you treat your tables and pay attention to the guests."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd or 4th time at this location and, as always, the service was excellent.  What was different the past two times though was their new, sparse, menu.  I had bragged up Mimi's to my son saying they have an extensive menu but when we looked online it was a lot smaller than I remembered.  When we got there it was indeed smaller and fairly ordinary to boot.  The food was good but the selection was nothing like it used to be.  And, unfortunately, for the first time my order was undercooked - and not by a little bit.  Wifey and I agreed that it is no longer on our list of personal favorites and that is too bad because it used to be her favorite."}
{"text":"My second visit:
I was looking for a good place to have breakfast that was close to where I live since I had to go to work soon. I didn't know Mimis served breakfast so I thought I would give it a try. When I arrived at 7:25 am there was only one other party. I waited a few minutes for someone to seat me. I didn't see anyone so I thoughtI would peruse the menu while I stood there. Finally a server showed up and sat me. She took my drink order and soon brought my coffee (+water even though I didn't ask for water=nice touch) and took my order right then. Another nice touch, since I was pressed for time. Then a coffee warm up right away. I'm liking this visit so far. Good coffee btw. We'll see how the breakfast is....
Wow. I ordered the corned beef hash, potatoes, toast. After I ordered I decided I wanted a croissant. It was all good. 
My breakfast experience was much better than my dinner experience. I'll definitely be back!

Below was my first visit:
I came here wanting to eat something different and honestly thought the appetizers looked really good. I WAS going to get like 2 or 3 of the appetizers and thats it. Against my better judgment I decided to get a ribeye steak 'medium'. I should have realized that I wasn't at a steakhouse. It was kind of tough and dry. I should have stuck with my first notion and gotten the meatballs and the artichoke hearts appetizers. The staff was nice even tho they were kind of busy. Next time. Next time. .."}
{"text":"Dreadful meal.  I ordered turkey, dressing, broccoli, cornbread, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce.  It all came smothered in gravy - NOT on the menu.  I asked for a replacement without the gravy.  The turkey was NOT real turkey.  It tasted like processed.  Had been soaking in watery something that left it with an off - processed and flavorless taste -  no wonder they smothered the first one in gravy.  The broccoli, although was not overcooked, was tasteless - tasted boiled.  Nothing on it, not even herbs.  The dressing was watery, mushy and although not a bad flavor, was not very flavorful due to the watering down.  The cornbread was missing from the plate - I had already had the plate exchanged so I did not want to be bothered telling them that they forgot the cornbread.  The mashed potatoes were decent, pretty good, nothing to write home about but, not bad.  The cranberry sauce was so sickly sweet that I could not eat it.  When I eat turkey at home, I have a heaping 3/4 cup of cranberry sauce.  I could not eat any of this.  I also took the turkey home to my dogs.  A most disgusting meal.  I don't know how they stay in business.  Will not go back.  Husband called it SAD - Standard American Diet.  It was obviously not prepared by any chef.  I bet I could choose a house at random off the street and find the cook of the house could do a much better job than that.  I do not go out to eat garbage but, this is what it was.  I did not exaggerate.  Lastly, our table faced an air filter in the wall near the ceiling, about 24\" x 16\".  It was filthy - coated in dust and muck - disgusting.  My guess is they NEVER bother to clean it.  What else do they never clean?"}
{"text":"Sooooo we didn't even get a chance to get seated and the place was NOT crowded whatsoever. They initially promised us a 30 minute wait then came back and said an hour. Maybe I'm just venting but what the hell? 5 p.m. On a Saturday is not the busiest. Not sure what happened? By the way I don't write negative reviews. This is a first for me but it really stood out. Will not go to Mimi's Cafe ever again...not that they care but ya my own peace of mind."}
{"text":"This is a 1 star review on the food, literally every dish was sub par or just bad.  The French onion soup tasted like they used tap water to make it.  The tomato/mozzarella salad had unripe, flavorless tomatoes and miniscule cheese balls.  Club sandwich was bland.  The customer service raises this to 3 stars.  The manager actually tasted the food and thanked us for the feedback."}
{"text":"Our service was wonderful. Lori was an amazing server. She gave us exceptional service and was so friendly and attentive. We had breakfast and our breakfast was delicious. Muffins were delicious and so moist. The options on the menu were not your same boring breakfast options. This place is a go to breakfast place for me now."}
{"text":"\"When their canned corned beef hash tasted better than one of their signature crepes. . .\"

--my wife

Mimi's Café always typified mediocrity to me, and my latest visit to this location hasn't changed my viewpoint.  We knew that the corned beef was canned because of the little square potatoes that were in it, and that was the highlight of my wife's breakfast.

My breakfast wasn't so hot either, with ok eggs, floppy bacon, and pasty french toast.

I don't know--maybe one day we'll learn.  Service at least was great."}
{"text":"Had a 12 o clock reservation 45 minutes later we were seated got our drinks and placed our orders 3 course type of meal and the salads and soups came out one at a time one of them not at all then one order came out half cold took another 45 minutes before we would see another plate come out min and my wife's cold burnt hockey puck of a burger came out and a sad excuse of a shrimp salad for my sister when i complained tuey said they woild give us 4 free muffins after sitting another half hour and the other food never showing up for the four other people in our party we finally talked to the manager who said he would go see what's going on he never came back to us but walked by eating we what to get up and go get him to find out what's going on and he had no idea what we were talking about we so we left without anyone eating and they still expected us to pay for what we did not get"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to come for breakfast,today we came for lunch.The food was great,the service excellent,Ana was our server.Every server is excellent there,I truly recommend this restaurant.Try the best muffins in the city."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Alma was a great host and was always making sure we had water and everything.  The eggs benedict was delicious and they have awesome frites lol if u go eat there ask for Alma, she's awesome."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. However, asian manager was not. Re-educate on what it means to do customer service. I wanted to give 1 star but food was just ok."}
{"text":"Lunch at Mimi's today with the husband and it was delicious as usual. The menu has changed since my last visit here but it's always a pleasure to dine here and I have never had any item ordered not be fresh and tasty. Today our server was a tad underwhelming and really had to be prodded along to bring the breadbasket my husband covets as well as refills for his soda but that was a minor annoyance as others were quick to pick up his slack. I ordered the guacamole and homemade chips for a starter (very flavorful and the chips crisp and warm and salted just right) and the Seven Meatballs for my meal. They were moist and delicious with plenty of yummy marinara sauce. My husband had the Quiche Lorraine with fruit. It was fabulous. Pot Pie sized and super fresh! We ordered a 4 pk of muffins to go because the hubs LOVES their chocolate croissants and carrot muffins. They are huge and fresh and pretty decently priced. All in all, for a chain restaurant the experience was good .... We will be back!"}
{"text":"We always love coming here for breakfast. The staff are always warm and pleasant and willing to serve. On weekends and holidays it can get pretty busy so arrive early. 

Food is good quality and generally served just the right temp. Great coffee and their bakery is fantastic. 

Comfortable and clean."}
{"text":"Always a good place for a meal too good.  Salmon Nicoise salad was good.  Turkey pesto ciabatta was nice (only shows on lunch menu)."}
{"text":"Food here is always good. The service like most places is hit or miss. If your server is a teenager going through an emo stage expect a \"miss\". But this review for me is about comparing this place to it's peer group. 4 Stars because it's clean, every time I eat here the food is good, lots's of choices, the price is where you'd expect and as far as a chain cafe it's pretty hard to beat."}
{"text":"Upon arrival I was greeting by the nice hostess. I said \"seat for one please\" and she tried to seat me in a booth made for 4people. Apparently they are fresh out of 1person seating. Ha, I liked the space. I decided to eat at the bar. Menu was like a plain bagel. I decided on the classic burger but then changed to the 2egg breakfast after looking at the breakfast menu. Delicious came to mind after I devoured my plate. Price was reasonable.  
Atmosphere was a classical feel, nice piano music playing. I wouldn't bring kids here unless they're teens. I foresee little kids screaming and asking for the iPad to play with as this is not a joint for them. I came for brunch and 90% of the patrons were 70yrs or older. Definitely an elderly established place. Deserts looked very enticing but I forged a wall between me and my stomach and took the high road home. Overall, a decent joint but lack of menu and ease of reading it gives it a 4."}
{"text":"We went there Saturday morning for breakfast. First thing: there were seemingly more people waiting in the lobby area then there were seated in the restaurant. We ended up waiting about 15 minutes. After we were called and being ushered to our table, we noticed empty tables in all three dining areas--and the lobby was still full. Apparently the wait staff was in as much of a hurry as the hostess, as it took the waitress another 10 minutes to bring menus. We hadn't been there in a while, and the first two things we saw were (1) a much smaller menu, and (2) much higher prices. We ordered and got our food, which was ... OK. Unless they were to drastically improve, the service in this restaurant is simply not good enough for the prices they charge."}
{"text":"Favorite menus are the breakfast and desserts menu. The French toast is my favorite item and I I like that they have the normal breakfast sides like bacon and sausage."}
{"text":"Hostess could be more friendly and professional. The food and environment is exceptional. Service was fine. They had a few less experienced waiters that socialized a bit too much. We fortunately had more experienced ones. Nice menu will return....."}
{"text":"Our server forgot about us, and then blamed the kitchen. Then once we finally got our food, it came out raw. We were there for over an hour and left without eating. Usually love Mimi's, but this location was terrible. Will not return."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Wes is the nicest,friendliest and funny. He makes the best hot tea....ever! :)  he is great, make sure you ask for him."}
{"text":"My son was served raw chicken in his sandwich here today. Totally raw and cold.
He ate half his sandwich before his fiance noticed. We all lost our lunch!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I'm getting to this a bit late but this place deserves a review.
I stopped here between breakfast and lunch on a run to the valley for a doctor's appointment. It was between here and McDonalds. Definitely glad we avoided McDonalds.
My grandfather, uncle and daughter were with me.

Both my uncle and grandfather had the tacos on the breakfast menu. My grandfather is the quiet type and never says much, but boy did he go on and on about those tacos and how good they were.

I had a burger on sourdough and it was everything I expected. It was very good and kept me filled for the long drive home. 

I wish I could recall our server's name but she was very polite and attentive.

Ive been to the Mimi's at Desert Ridge and they weren't nearly as good as this place in both quality and service. This one is very very good."}
{"text":"We are from NC visiting our son and daughter in law in Mesa. First trip to Mimi's. Met up with friends and we all had a great breakfast. We will return to Mimi's next trip out. Everyone was very nice and service was great.

{"text":"Great food, big portions with eggs, meat, and pancakes or waffles for about under $12 You won't leave hungry.

My son Noah  and I frequently pass Mimi's and this past Saturday I decided to stop. We were quickly seated in a very rustic and cozy setting. Our waitress  was ok, seemed like she had maybe one too many tables.  She didn't discuss the menu at all and gave us our check while we were eating, we seemed kinda rushed. Our food was great and arrived quickly. The portions were very large."}
{"text":"Very hit and miss. Always good service, but the food there can be low quality at times."}
{"text":"Came here for French onion soup and some spinach dip - soup was cold so we sent it back; 20 minted later they brought the replacement soup and it was even colder so we said no thanks and left."}
{"text":"Worst experience I ever had at Mimis. Had the corn beef hash and eggs. The hash was all dried out with no flavor what so ever. Eggs were burnt around the edges. Waitress was a older woman but was slow as hell and never came back to the table to ask how everything was. It was very slow at the time so don't feel there was any excuse for the poor food and service."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch so we had the place almost to ourselves. Nice selection of menu items to order and the food we ordered were nice size portions and we were able to take some home for later. Service was good and good value for the money."}
{"text":"I go there with mom on Thursday manager rude and hostess refuse to sit me with Lori the server never going back again ."}
{"text":"Honeybran oat muffin and Carrot raisin muffin!!! What was it we ordered for our meal:-)  Great service and the food was tasty."}
{"text":"Yelp reviews were a lil low so I was worried... But had a great experience.. Food was cooked properly, and staff friendly.. 

I had the Ham n Swiss Crepes, delicious, cooked perfect, and great flavor in the sauce inside.. 

Also had a Blueberry muffin which was also on point.. 

I think most of the reviews on here might be from critical individuals who mainly only post negativity, which usually carry their own ego on their shoulder.. Mimi's I will be back.. 

Little costly, for breakfast, will try lunch next trip.. but well worth it.."}
{"text":"Mimi's is a fantastic breakfast spot! I have come here and had dinner/dessert, a bit disappointing, but they never mess up on breakfast! Their egg croissant sandwich is perfection and the service is always great! I love the decor and intimacy, they are also never jam-packed so it is pretty easy to get a table for breakfast even on a Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"Menu changed and the food is horrible and horribly overpriced. They are trying to go with a French flair and failed. DO NOT GO HERE. Gross!!"}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST!! My husband, my 3 month old baby and I just went this weekend to take advantage of a coupon they had sent us and let me tell you it was delicious. I tried a super yummy cream cheese french toast with fruit that came with eggs as well! The eggs were perfectly \"over medium \" cooked and I got to substitute the \"meat (bacon)\" side with their potatoes (for no additional price) which were so fresh and good! My husband tried their banana pecan pancakes and he loved them as well they were so soft! Great service, great food. We have officially found our new favorite breakfast place oh and btw they have breakfast all day!! So pleased :)"}
{"text":"My family went to this Mimi's for Easter 2017.  This place used to have good service.  On this day, the service was unbelievably horrible.  Every facet of the experience was BAD.  My steak was bloody even though I ordered it medium-well.  The manager was completely useless, and many people there were having a similar experience all around us.  Lousy service, manager had bad attitude....giving everyone boxes of free stale muffins as if that makes up for a ruined lunch.  He really seemed to actually be mentally-impaired.  In the parking lot as we left, several people were discussing how bad their lunch was as well.  The manager needs to be fired."}
{"text":"Food ans service was great.... But no public wifi and the ac in the restraint was too high and caused both of my aunts feeling so cold. As well I felt cold in the restraint as well....  Turn down the ac and provide wifi..."}
{"text":"Would give this zero stars but not an option.  Friday night dinner out with wife.   Was sat in main section of restarting with a large Birthday party.  Kids loud as well as parents who have never apparently been at anything nicer than Dennys. 
Manager should have never allowed seating in the surrounding space as the whole experience was miserable. 
Waitress was brand new and doing her best with no support.  Service took over an hour to get our meal and it was wrong first time out.  
Meal was lukewarm and small portions.  
Even the staff kept apologizing for the rude group.  
Manager wandered around but never stopped by tables to apologize or make it right
Used to be a good place to go but the deterioration of service and lack of management concern causes me to warn others to pass by.  Better places just close by"}
{"text":"While I have eaten lunch and dinner here in the past, most of my experiences at Mimi's have been with their breakfasts, which I find are well-prepared and tasty.  The atmosphere at the restaurant is wonderful--nice soothing French music and old time jazz, rather than the the loud and obnoxious music at so many other restaurants these days.  And their coffee is superb, not the weak water-like substance found at most other breakfast establishments. The prices here are also within reason, and there are usually coupons available which make this place a very nice spot to eat."}
{"text":"Of all the Mimi's I've been to in the Valley, this location could stand some improvements here and there... the female greeters at the front door are very nice and welcoming... although some of the male staff seemed to be put off my having to take our order (at approx. 4pm when not busy)... then, he brough plain iced tea and threw down 2 straws and walked away... we actually ordered the raspberry and there was no lemon... quite a while later, when he set down the check without asking if we'd like more, we asked for a refill with the correct tea... he just walked away as if was put out to do his job... we looked at the check and for $2.59/each drink it seemed rather high... that reminded us that earlier in the week when we stopped in for lunch, the waitress charged us each for 2 refills... wow!  Won't be going back to this location again, and will definitely ask if there's a fee for refills if make it back to any of the other newly-renovated locations.  For the prices, which granted is good consistent quality food, down't seem like too much to expect free refills."}
{"text":"Such a great place, my fav for breakfast or mimosa brunch.  This is the 3rd location for me to try.  Always clean and kind service.  
Best coffee!! 
Today I had quiche Florentine for the first time...it was pretty good, served very fast, perfect...since I was in a hurry.  
See if you can find the rooster when you get there."}
{"text":"Haven't been in several years, and I was really surprised to see how the menu has grown and improved. I'll probably be coming back a few more times to try out all the things I didn't order. Friendly staff, and food quality that you'd expect from a chain."}
{"text":"I've heard plenty of mixed feedback on Mimi's, and today I decided to try the chicken caesar salad to go. It came with a muffin (I got blueberry), and it is hands down one of the best muffins I have ever had. The salad, though, was very underwhelming. There was barely any chicken on it, and the dressing came already mixed in - a lot of it, too. So when I got back to my desk, the leaves and croutons were quite soggy and wilted. For that alone, I would take away a star, because it seems like salad-to-go 101 to not do that. The actual dressing was good though, and the ambiance seemed nice inside for the two minutes I was there. On the fence if I would come back again."}
{"text":"I have to say I am not a big Valentine's fan. I don't like Hallmark holiday's. We ended up by chance going to MiMi's for Valentine's Day and they had a great menu and price for that menu for the evening. I am just impressed by their service, portion size and just the overall experience. I just love this place."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places and by walking in the door you can tell there is no secret about this place. It is awesome and again I sit at the bar a lot because then I don't have to wait in line. This is real therapeutic because I am realizing that I am just a spoiled brat and just don't like waiting in line, I want to just be seated. Anyway, the food is great, prices are just as great and the food portions are awesome too. I am 6'3\" 260 pds. with an athletic build, so I can afford big portions cause I burn most of it off. I will get off of my soapbox and finish. Great job at MiMi's all of them are great."}
{"text":"Service is awful. Lady next to me to go to the bathroom, she was eating alone. They came by and cleared her table. She hadn't even started yet. Then I got the 3 corse meal and they forgot the first one and came out and threw his coworker under the buss. Your my waiter, own the situation. Then it took 20 min to get our check after we were done eating. We had napkins on the plates and everything."}
{"text":"You know it's going to be great when you walk in at 1pm on a Saturday and the hostess asks us if we want to sit at the bar in a restaurant that is not even that busy...
I've never been to Mimi's Cafe before so I'm not sure if this is normal. To me, it seems weird. Do I look like I need a drink? 

We were thankfully seated at a table and given lunch/dinner menus, to our chagrin. I thought for certain we had missed brunch, but thankfully when we asked our server, she brought us breakfast menus. 

My boyfriend ordered the brioche French toast and I ordered an omelette with potatoes and a muffin. Phew, that's a lot of food. The omelette was pretty good, but the potatoes were a bit forgettable. They seemed soggy, like they had either been sitting out for a while or cooked in too much oil. I tried a bite of the French toast and it was quite tasty-although too heavy for me. I guess that is to be expected from brioche so that's more about personal preference. 

Overall, service was good. Our server was really friendly and helpful with the menu, and was prompt on refilling our coffees and waters. I wish more restaurants would just leave a whole pot of coffee at your table..or water. I drink water and coffee like it's going out of style but I digress. I haven't been to a place in recent memory that actually does that.

Price-wise, it seemed on par with a lot of places that I normally go to for brunch, however most of the places I go to aren't chain restaurants. 

Overall, an a-ok restaurant. Not spectacular-but not horrible either."}
{"text":"What a disaster this restaurant has become. Poorly managed and staffed. We arrived at 10:50 and waited 5+ minutes for the hostess to acknowledge us as their phone rang unanswered several times. We were finally seated in a booth. The restaurant was about 1/3 occupied and not busy at all. We sat at least 5 minutes before the server took our order. Then we sat, and sat and sat. Food arrived at 11:43. I had ordered the Smoked Salmon Benedict, of course it came out as an original ham Benedict. Sent it back and waited another 10 minutes while my wife and daughter ate their meals. When my food came out I was pleasantly surprised as it was very good. Unfortunately, I will never get to try any of their other menu items as this restaurant is too poorly managed to give it another chance."}
{"text":"This place has potential. Let me start by saying, I love the décor and ambiance. I have only been to New Orleans once, and this place captures that. To top it off they have jazz as background music. I came here because it's in the neighborhood where my wife works and we decided to grab breakfast before she went to work. If you like French cuisine this is the place. They have a bottle of French wine at every table. (For a price of course.)

When we arrived at 8:00 am on a Friday the place was relatively empty. The waitress seated us immediately. After browsing the breakfast menu I discovered that you can get a champagne breakfast. They do have a full bar. This is not your traditional breakfast joint. You won't find biscuits and gravy, or hash browns. They offer breakfast with a French influence. Quiche and crepes are featured. You will find \"griddlecakes\", waffles and of course French toast. This is served with breakfast meat and fresh fruit. They have burgers and a few specialty sandwiches for lunch. The dinner entrees feature chicken, turkey, pot roast, and salmon.

I ordered the Santa Fe omelet. This is 3 eggs diced jalapeños, cilantro, tomatoes, onions, tortilla strips, and Monterey Jack cheese. The omelet is topped with the tortilla strips , guacamole, and chipotle sauce. The dish was served with 2 slices of toast and herb roasted potatoes. The omelet was perfect. all the flavors worked well together. I thought the roasted potatoes were a welcomed change from the usual country fried ones or hash browns.

So you wonder why only 3 stars? The price is high. very few things are under $10.00. I love the French influence, but you can't order just a plain cheese omelet. No biscuits and gravy. The waitress seemed like she didn't want to be there. She only came around to bring the check and ask if we wanted dessert. No coffee refills. Well to be honest, she did ask about a refill as she brought the check, Too late now. She did give my wife and me each a muffin to go because this was our first visit.

If the price was a little lower I might come in to try one of the burgers at lunch. I'm sure it's good, but I'd rather not pay $11.50 for a burger."}
{"text":"I like Mimi's mainly for 2 things - their breakfasts, which are a good value and feature several items they do well that Brak likes - eggs benny, with nice thick ham slices, and good bacon.  Too many restaurants serve crummy bacon, and that can ruin an otherwise good breakfast.  I also really like the turkey dinner they serve, and occasionally the Asian chicken salad.  For a chain operation, it's pretty decent stuff, and the quality is very consistent, even across locations.  They fall short of 5 stars for inconsistent service.  Occasionally it's great, most of the time it's ok, and occasionally it's really bad.  But the food always meets expectations."}
{"text":"We came in at 11, the server was busy and was sat several tables at once. We watched her run from table to table taking drink orders. Only the hostess helped her, not the manager on duty. Several tables sat neglected to no fault of our server.  Someone (perhaps a chef ) in red delivered our food and refilled our drinks. The food was ok, my husbands hamburger was burnt. We tried to order dessert and was told they were out of the creme brûlée. Our server was very nice and friendly. We waited 27 minutes from order to table."}
{"text":"I've been here for all three meals before, but my favorite has to be brunch. It's consistently good, not too pricy and the service is typically mediocre. Sometimes you get someone who is phenomenal, but it depends on the busyness as well, but don't be discouraged if there's a wait. They serve breakfast all day and are very accommodating to the little ones as well!"}
{"text":"The mimosa's were fantastic! Cute place! A lot to look at- French quotes, New Orleans style theme. Many great food choices. I ordered one of the crepe dishes and mmm mmm good!"}
{"text":"My first trip to Mimi's. Nothing spectacular really. Just your average chain store eatery. The waiter who was also the bar tender, was sorta serious. A smile would have certainly added to my dinner experience. 

Anyway, the restaurant wasn't too full, despite it being a Saturday night. Not that I'm complaining! I ordered chicken crepe with garden salad and tomato basil soup (which tasted suspiciously like my bottled spaghetti sauce--warmed!) and my friend got grilled salmon with a side of brown rice. We got bread and sweet pumpkin with a creamy dip to begin the meal. I'm watching my weight, so I didn't want to stuff myself with the bread, but it was hard to keep my hands off it. 

The crepe was drowned in lemon cream sauce---I should have remembered to ask for it on the side. They tasted good, though. The salmon was perfectly flavored--not too overwhelmed with spices, not too bland, and just the right amount of juice in it. 

They have a really big menu, and I wanted to try more items. I think I will be back. Just wish to be served with a smile the next time round :)"}
{"text":"Had dinner there Monday night... Waited about 4 mins for someone to greet and seat us.  Had Surf and Turf... with NY strip steak.  Got seated and had to wait longer for silverware after we got our salads.  Thought she had to forge them since it took her another 4 mins to get silverware which was mentioned 2x already earlier of its absence.  Got our dinner and my steak medium rare was inedible. It was tough... had to fight cutting it with a steak knife. Wilted fries only .. no option for baked potato.  Had to send it back.. wanted chicken and they are all out of chicken.   Salmon?  Best part of dinner was the spinach. No compensation for our possible return... well I am never returning.  Terrible service and food.  I am removing myself from their online e-Club."}
{"text":"It's not bad, and the walnut strawberry salad was decent. Really busy during rush hour, and hard to find parking unless you go across the street to the mall parking."}
{"text":"Always a great place to fall back on! Really love the carrot raisin muffins, omelettes, and french onion soup!"}
{"text":"Call ahead on weekends.  We've always loved Mimi's... menu is a lot more limited and pricier now but they still have breakfasts big enough to share, the most amazing crossaints and great food. Lunch specials are good too and the wait staff is always friendly, even though they often have too many tables at once.  This is GREAT place for meetings/lunch events with a private room."}
{"text":"Best turkey dinner in AZ. The atmosphere is nice and the food is a reasonable price. Be careful, it can get crowded. I wish I could tell you more about other dishes, but the turkey dinner is good that is all I ever get from here. I just can't get enough. Real turkey, real cranberry sauce, yum."}
{"text":"Oh, yummy. 

I know this is a chain, and while I typically avoid chain places like a cat avoids water, I actually really, really, really like this place. First time I went was with family. We helped ourselves to chips, salsa, calamari and the unique variety of bread they serve. All very satisfying.

Then I had the BBQ Burger. Oh my, heaven slapped between two buns. Bacon on top. Bliss. It was too massive for me to finish, so I took it home. 

Then, dessert. Banana Foster pie, that's all I gotta say. Scrumptious. My dad had the bread pudding - meh. 

My second trip here was with a friend - the afternoon before our 5K race. I helped myself to the Tuna Salad Sandwich (topped with avocado) with a requested 4 slices of bacon. Superb. It came served with fries.

Upon my request, a plate of fresh fruit come out before lunch. Melon. Oranges. Pineapple. Delicious! 

And it won't break your bank. Between paying for myself, my friend and leaving a generous tip, the tally came to $30. 

I will definitely be back. In fact, some days I find myself craving Mimi's. Maybe it's the \"quaint\" feel or the insanely expansive menu, but I just like this place. 

The menu is so expansive, everyone in your dining party is sure to find something s/he likes - including beer."}
{"text":"This Mimi's Cafe is terrible! One star for the tangerine mimosa that made me forget about the terrible experience for about 3 minutes.

Put our name down for a table for 2 and was told it would be 20 minutes. 30 minutes went by so I decided to check up on the list since I started to notice people who came after us being seated. One of the hostess' (please tell me why there were 4 hosts and none of them knew what they were doing) looked at the list longer than she should have and said \"a couple more people.. about 5 more minutes.\" Waited a little longer and my bf went up to see the status. Turns out our name was never on the list. WTF? Really?? They were lying to us.. all 4 of the hosts were clueless and unorganized. After that we got a table and the service was terrible. Took 10 minutes for my bf to get his coffee and water.. even more to get the waitress' attention to get our check.

Worst service ever!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a reasonably priced breakfast or lunch. They love us seniors!"}
{"text":"Most awful dining experience ever. Arrived about 6:45pm, not busy, no host/hostess in site. After 10 minutes a server started seating people. We ordered, restaurant got a bit busier because power went out at Chandler Mall. Our selections were a tuna melt with house salad with  ranch, tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich, quiche Loraine with a muffin and French dip and fries. Maybe 15 minutes to make? Please remember we were there before it got busy. Server brought muffin out right away. At 7:45 the couple that were seated after us asked what was taking so long for their food. Wa la.. 2 servers came out right away with their food. We thought we'd try that , and wa la, servers came out with our food! I'd like to say that waiting so long for our food was the bad experience, but wait.... My salad had vinegraitte, not ranch; the quiche was florentine, not lorraine ( and at this point with a very cold muffin); and the fries were awful. The lady who got her food right before us had ordered shrimp which was still frozen. Took 10 minutes for manager to come out of his hiding place to address this issue and his excuse was that they got busy.. We were the first 2 parties seated before they got busy. Our server never came by to refill our drinks, we had to get her attention; she never updated us as to why it was taking so long, and never once asked us how our meals were. Oh, and the fries? As we left restaurant, it seemed like everyone was in agreement as the plates still had all the fries left on them.
Sorry Mimi's...we will never be back."}
{"text":"Entered the restaurant...no one at the hostess stand.  Wait a minute or two and someone shows up from the back.  We're seated.  Wait close to 10 minutes, no one shows up.  Oddly my wife ate here about two years ago and the same thing happened.  She stayed that time, we didn't this time.

The food may be good but I wouldn't know.  The service and management is most surely lacking."}
{"text":"The meal chosen was tasty but I will not be returning.  As a first time patron, I was given free muffins, with extra protein...a bug crawled out of one of the muffins. Not sure if trying to sue them is worth the time or money so I just won't return and I'll share the video with others so they are informed. It doesn't allow me to attach the video. The muffin may have been carrot, not sure."}
