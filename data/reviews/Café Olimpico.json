{"text":"I usually avoid writing bad reviews but this time I couldn't help myself: it is not my first time there and the coffee's usually ok, however, a few days ago, what I was served was the worst coffee I've had in years in Montreal. I understand that this place is an institution and to be fair, it is a nice coffee shop. That being said, this should not mean that the barrista should haphazardly grind an amount of beans without even removing any excess...BARELY pressing down on the coffee....basically, worse than an amateur. I took a sip of my latte, tried adding sugar but that only made it more disgusting, threw it away. I had two other friends with me who had espressos and it was also a bad experience for them too. To Olympico's staff, sorry again but I really hope you do something about the quality of the coffee you serve."}
{"text":"I don't really understand the hype over Olimpico.  It's right across the street from me and by far the closest café to me, but I always find myself going farther afield.  The coffee is okay, I suppose, but there's coffee that's just as good to be had elsewhere on St-Viateur and especially one block up on Bernard.

Apart from the decent coffee, Olimpico is a strange, disharmonious, and unfortunate blend of the worst aspects of a cafe and a sports bar.  The food is at best underwhelming (with some options, such as the pre-packaged, days-old croissants, being totally off the radar of acceptability), so there's nothing to complement the decent coffee.  There are plenty of people who go there to chat and/or read, and the patio is nice enough on a sunny day, though the clash between this crowd and the sports-bar contingent is palpable and insufficiently tempered by Olimpico's lack of a liquor licence (which, to me, makes it the worst possible place to watch a sports game)."}
{"text":"Beautiful men are a dime a dozen in Montreal, but Cafe Olimpico attracts a certain type of hyper-masculine, futball-lovin', solid & broad, tall dark 'n handsome mec that is a cut above the average beefcake spotted around the city. Grab a delicious cappuccino or espresso and hang out on the patio on a warm summer's day, or grab a seat inside, and watch the menfolk stroll in and out with steaming beverages in hand. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've honestly never been so baffled by nearly universal praise for an establishment. 

Full disclosure: I'm a barista. I'm by no means a coffee expert, but I know the do's and don'ts and can tell a good cup from a bad one. Let's just say I knew my coffee experience was going to be awful before I even ordered my drink. 

Biggest red flag was that all their espresso was preground. It's common sense that you grind your beans as close to extraction as possible. Everyone wants their coffee fresh, right? Second warning sign was a practice that I've honestly never seen done before. For some strange reason the barista was dosing a certain amount of espresso into the portafilter and then scooping equally old (if not older) espresso into it with  a piece of wood from a mound off of the dirty counter. At this point I had to avert my eyes because the horror of what I was witnessing was just too painful. Unfortunately, I opened my eyes just in time to see the guy cover my cappuccino with a thick layer of cocoa powder. 

No need to go into the nitty gritty about the taste, obviously it wasn't good. If you're reading this before your first Olimpico experience, there's still hope! Head down St. Viateur until you hit Cafe Myriade (II). Primo coffee (49th Parallel) and the baristas know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Thought this place was funny. I'm not even sure what I had, but I had wanted a regular iced espresso. Problem is they don't have ice cubes, that was a first for me. I also wanted a regular coffee, but they only have espresso. Also a first. Guess they don't do much here, but at least they have seemed to have mastered the art of espresso. They also seem to have quite a following as its a busy place, and its also in a nice neighborhood. Will be back, but maybe in winter and not on a 90 degree day."}
{"text":"The best place to grab a drink in Mile-End. The staff are awesome. 

Nothing more needs to be said."}
{"text":"Is it the most pristine cafe? No. Is it a quiet, trendy atmosphere? No. Does it have the best espresso, most interesting mix of people, and terrasse that inspires imaginative novels within anyone who can't string a verb and a noun together? YES! It's da best. And open da night. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"Café allongé... such perfect crema you have to eat it with your little spoon"}
{"text":"Great place to \"stop and have a coffee.\" I mean, it's perfect for a date, catching up with friends, or just do some people watching.

Personally, I prefer the place during the warmer months when the terrace is open, but it's still a nice place to drop into and warm up during the colder ones. It can, however, be tough to get a table inside when the terrace is closed."}
{"text":"Olimpico is a neighborhood staple.

{"text":"Cruising around Milevend after a rough hike (I took the wrong bus and had to walk an hour and a half back) I yelp'd and found Cafe Olimpico. I loved the place! If you've ever been to the famous 'Bill and Toni's' in Sydney, Australia you'll feel right at home home! Solidly authentic Italian Cafe with outstanding coffee and all those lovely, irrestible cakes and biscuits you find in Italian cafe bars. 

Outstanding terasse for lounging in the sun and excellent fast and free wifi. 

Not at all expensive, friendly staff, relaxed and enjoyable. If you want to chill for a few hours, surf the net, chat with mates, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best-creamy-latte in town, this is your place. Biscotti are also very good."}
{"text":"The coffee is really good. They have a nice patio. This seems to be the coffee place in the Mile End where all the cool kids hang out, but there is also a nice mix of neighborhood folks. A great coffee shop in the neighborhood. I recommend it."}
{"text":"J'adooooooore ce café de quartier! Leur latte est délicieux! Le personnel est sympa et l'ambiance très agréable! J'aime aussi la terrasse. Petit bémol, tu ne peux pas sortir de la terrasse directement mais dois repasser à l'intérieur. Je ne comprends pas! D'où le 4/5."}
{"text":"Really good latte. It didn't sit on my stomach!"}
{"text":"Very cheap and very friendly.  Guys picked up on my buddy's Buffalo Bills cap and proceeded to talk up the no huddle offense.  Well done Canada. 5 out of 5 bearded baristas."}
{"text":"My friend and I had an espresso and a latte at this mile-end landmark, serving coffees for over 40 years. I never write reviews but this place is really worth my time, it is a real jem !.. I now know why so many hipsters love this place. My espresso brought me back to italy. It was smooth, creamy and rich with flavour. My friend had a latte in a tall glass. She said it was the best she's ever had. Our barrista was very friendly, pleasant , and witty, quickly serving us. He asked us if we are from the area. We told him that we were from the west end of the city, and this was our first time here, He seemed to be very proud serving his brew. He gave us a quick history of the place and said he has been serving regulars for over 12 years. The place has a magnificent  high silver ceiling, the lighting is just right for romantic moments and perfect for people-watching.  We will definitely be back.. Great Job Olimpico !"}
{"text":"Best coffee in Montreal and in a fantastic area too! 
Order any of their coffee drinks and you are sure to enjoy its rich and flavourful taste."}
{"text":"So far, the best coffee I've had in Montreal so far. It's always busy. An old school Italian coffee shop. Great patio on a sunny day."}
{"text":"Excellent café latte. Un peu bruyant et très achalandé, j'ai du attendre 15 minutes pour une chaise pour m'assoir. Un personne seule avec son ordi peut prendre la place de 4 personnes à une table, ce n'est pas évident.
Quand il y a moins de monde, c'est encore plus agréable. Le personnel est sympathique et efficace!"}
{"text":"Was treated so poorly. Always enjoyed coming here because of the good coffee but not anymore. I asked the price if I were to add something to my order and the barista mumbled something about making his job easier and then when I was getting my change back he said \"not that you're tipping me either\" quite loudly. Found it extremely rude and uncalled for. Not going back."}
{"text":"Great place overall.. Olimpico has a great atmosphere and attracts a large crowd (yes, be prepared to run into someone you know). While this place is OK in the Winter, it's pretty darn great in the summer! They have a cozy terrace that they open up, should you choose to sip your cafe outside. Their Cafe Crema is sweet, creamy and I guarantee will leave you with a smile. Their espresso is phenomenal and this is one of the few places that I don't mind ordering decaff (taste-wise). 

Oh and their biscotti are a must-try! They've got a few sweet flavors to choose from."}
{"text":"Best coffee in town. Friendly staff and free wifi! Large cafe with plenty of seating and non-pretentious atmosphere. Good prices, $2.50 for a cappuccino."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place that hasn't already been said. It's a big, open old-school coffee house. Italian owned and run, so you know the coffee is 1st rate. I go there all hours of the day for a latte or espresso to go, and the biscotti are pretty good. Probably the best spot in the Mile End for coffee."}
{"text":"We noticed this place a block away as there were a bunch of people milling around the entrance and in a nice outdoor patio area. You could easily tell it was a neighborhood favorite. The guy who took our order was great, they were quick despite a lot of customers, and the coffee was great. There is a lot of seating inside and outside and rugby playing on a tv in the back corner. No frills inside and the wifi was out while we were there, but you could definitely spend some time there on a laptop. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The espresso is very good. But I won't be back. Why? The guy who made my espresso couldn't be any more obnoxious. 

Geez. First he tells me I'm standing to far from the counter and that I have to stand closer if I want to order. Ok, I take a step forward. Apparently, I wasn't in the right place. I had to take three steps to where the line begins. Stupid me for thinking I could cut in front of... Nobody."}
{"text":"The quality of the Latte varies from one of the best of Montreal to terrible. It depends on the Barista, unfortunately.

The beans they sell are relatively old at times. Some really taste like they were roasted more than 2 weeks which really ruins the Lattes you make at home. I have tasted a huge difference depending on how soon they sell them after roasting -they don't roast them in-house but get them already roasted 2-3 times a week which even adds more time to ruin the taste-.

The seating is average and I think they have free internet.

I still pass by and grab a Latte if I see certain Baristas making them. If you like making your own espressos, I suggest you get your beans elsewhere."}
{"text":"Perfectly crafted coffees, delicious biscotti, atmosphere is A+. Our favorite Sunday treat."}
{"text":"There is nothing worse for me than walking significantly out of my way for a cup of coffee only to find something altogether overly hyped and remarkably mediocre.  There are some really nice places in Montreal for excellent coffee, and this simply doesn't compare.  It's little more than a sports bar with an incredibly effective word of mouth campaign.

The espresso itself violates all laws of good preparation.  It isn't ground fresh for each shot, which is an instant red flag.  The baristas use not only grounds that have been sitting in the doser for several minutes, but even those that have fallen into the mountain of grounds sitting beneath the grinder.  The espresso sits alone in the glass for quite a while before the steamed milk is added, which degrades the aromatics and allows the crema to dissipate.  The milk itself is 'resteamed', which means new milk is poured into batches of already steamed milk and steamed again, which adds off-flavors and denatures proteins, preventing the development of quality microfoam, and it is a technique commonly associated with places like Starbucks that focus more on pushing customers through the door than on quality.  More than that, it isn't steamed in traditional latte or cappuccino pitchers, but in containers that could not possibly produce the vortex necessary to properly incorporate air into the steamed milk, and it shows in the product, a completely separated pitcher of hot milk topped with a poor macrofoam that shouldn't even be used for cappuccinos.  The espresso I received there had a thin film of crema that rapidly disappeared. I was nearly incapable of finishing it, let alone enjoying it.  It was a shot that any self-respecting third wave coffee shop would immediately pour down the drain and prepare again.

I can't stress enough that this place, far from being 'one of the best coffee shops in North America', can't even compete with many chain establishments in Montreal in terms of coffee quality.  If you want to go there for the ambiance, go right ahead, but don't go there with the assumption that you will receive a decent cup of coffee.  It is unfortunate that this coffee shop has received so much positive feedback as it may be under the illusion that it's actually doing something right."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and these people know how to make a coffee. They have the best iced coffee in town and the affogato is to die for. They also have cannolis on the weekends. One of those Italian cafes filled with football paraphernalia and genuine pictures of the Italian community from the past. 
I always came upon the barristas are two macho Italian men who have a genuine warmth to them, who I guess to beworking the night shift. They also have a terrace outside with a continuous bench that is comfy, yet has no tables. It's more of a place to grab your coffee and sit down with your friend to chat rather than eat. This place is also close to St. Viateur bagels, so we usually grab a bagel and go to Olimpico to eat them with our coffee."}
{"text":"Best cafe lattes in town, and very reasonably priced. It's an odd little spot with its sports screens and lines for lattes, but just another part of what makes Montreal so unique."}
{"text":"After hearing bad reviews about the staff, I still made the long trek from Verdun to get a great espresso pull. I entered around 3pm to see about 10 people in line and 15 or so sitting around the tables. I was immediately told to leave and that they were closing (after he let the local that held the door for me get in line). I told him I was in town from the US and was really looking forward to trying their coffee, had come over from Verdun, and would take my coffee to go. He very rudely told me that he has been working since 11am by himself and if I were in his shoes, I would understand. After pleading again, I was told to just leave. While I like to sympathize with people, working a 4 hour shift as a barista is most certainly not an excuse for being flat-out dismissive of your customers. That, sir, earns your business a poor rating on all the review sites I belong to. Should have listened to the others."}
{"text":"Lived upto great reviews on Yelp.

Fast moving line ... Nothing fancy in seating area but loved the old Italian look and feel to the interior (dark wood).

Fantastic cappuccino with a fresh scone. Shame no butter or jam.

Very much a hipster kinda place with no pretentiousness ... That's a big plus.

Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I went in tonight at 11:30pm to sit down for a quick cup of coffee. Seeing as they close at midnight, and there were half a dozen tables seated with full drinks, I thought I had time to sit down. 

I was told they close in 10 minutes, not in 30. I asked if they stayed open until midnight. I was sarcastically told they close \"whenever', and \" that's just the restaurant business.\"

Having worked in the restaurant business myself, there were some better ways to deal with this situation, none of which involve sarcastically snapping at the customer. He could have recommended to get my drink in a to-go cup so I could leave with my drink if I wasn't finished before they closed. 

I my experience, we wouldn't turn away customers if the restaurant was pretty full close to closing time.

I understand the staff wanting to go home after a long day, but it never justifies a snarky attitude."}
{"text":"This place is so cool. When I came here they had three TVs and one large projector screen playing two different Eurocup matches! Strong coffee but authentic and their service is quick, friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Really, their coffee is wonderful.  Everything is made the way I like it, lattes in a glass, everyone knows each other, very chill, very comfortable atmosphere.  And the TV behind the bar show league soccer.  I love it."}
{"text":"I came for the first time a few months ago. My experience was awful, but was back in Montreal at a friend's place nearby and thought I needed to give the place another try since its rating is so high and pause seems almost universal. Unfortunately, this second experience perfectly reflected the first. The gentlemen working were cold, rude and condescending. Perhaps i should come back during the day instead of evening as they must have 4.5 stars for a reason, but I just can't figure out how. Both times I've come here the staff behaved as if they were doing me a favour by even taking my order (last time they wouldn't let me order unless I took my tea to go... 40 minutes before closing...). This time the person in front of me was also greeted with rudeness, so at least I feel less alone in my bad experience with this place. I'd love to say \"third time's a charm\" but I think I've given up."}
{"text":"Nice coffee. 

Real authentic Italian coffee house, the service is full on.

The kind of place to watch sports.

A real classic place."}
{"text":"Polite, friendly staff. Great coffee and sports on in the background. Can't complain."}
{"text":"Love this place.

The coffee varies from delicious to grainy/bitter/bleh but hey, for $2.50 I go any time.

The seating is reliable and the vibe is good.

Beats most coffee shops in the city"}
{"text":"Great coffee, atmosphere, and people watching.

Simply put, Olimpico is the quintessential neighbourhood coffee shop. Great for a morning caffeine fix, date, or just to hang out with friends.

Don't know what else I could possibly say."}
{"text":"Great cappuccino after a morning walk!  Friendly service, very affordable, and only a short stroll to Saint-Viateur Bagel.  Busy place at Noon but the line moves quickly.  Lots of indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"One of the best coffees I've ever drank in my life. I ordered a double espresso and it tasted wonderful. 

I often have the problem where the coffee doesn't have a full enough flavor and tastes sweet, not here! It was strong, full, and delicious. 

A nice touch was the huge amount of outdoor seating, it was an awesome place to spend our Sunday morning people watching."}
{"text":"Best cappuccino I've had outside of Italy. A great patio to sit on when the sun is out. Fast service. Someone actually pulling espresso shots. Hey starbucks! This is how you do coffee!"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing espresso.  Their drinks are amazing....the rest of it, I could take or leave.  They have a relaxing patio to sit and enjoy an espresso.  You will need it if you go on a Saturday and have to wait 20 deep for a drink, while dealing with the surly staff.

It was a great place during the week, I would avoid on the weekends."}
{"text":"Best coffee in Montreal. Real local experience. Vito and Vince are always happy to see you."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop in the mile end. Prior to coming here, I've never understood why people called this place an coffee institution and upon arrival at the coffee shop, I couldn't agree more. 
It's quite different from all the other indie coffee shops I've been to, Olimpico resembles a Italian bar/coffee shop, frequent by people of all ages. 

Now for the actual coffee: truly worth the hype. I had a cortado latte (introduced to me by my friend Ann) and it was probably one of the best coffee experiences I've had to date. If I dare to say, it may be even better than the latte I had at Dave's coffee in San Fran."}
{"text":"Best coffee in Montreal and definitely one of the best coffee houses in North America. Doesn't get any better unless you travel to Argentina or Europe. 

I also love their outdoor bench like seating that's wonderful during the warmer days of spring / summer. Only problem is this place is so popular with the locals you never want to leave once you score a seat after someone leaves."}
{"text":"By far the best coffee in town. Where else will you see a 50+ people line to get coffee in the middle of the day?? And this is 5 miles away from nearest business district, so no starbucks type hype here. Also check out their tiramisu - you will love it"}
{"text":"truly.
excellent.
coffee.

montreál.

I know, I know - some folks no longer love Olimpico due to the  increasingly / disturbingly high HTQ (hipster tourist quotient) and weekend throngs of those lavishly indulging their recently acquired and exquisitely accessorized children,  But I still love Olimpico for one reason - THE COFFEE!  They make brilliant coffee - consistently fresh, always properly done at the right temp.  Fast, efficient (don't let the line frighten you noobs - this place moves with an amazing alacrity) and truly reasonable pricing.  Located a short walk from St-Viateur Bagel and all of the other greatness that IS the Mile End."}
{"text":"Best coffee in Montreal and probably in Canada. The patio is amazing and the environment is super relaxed. I moved away from Montreal a year ago for work and this place is what I miss the most. 

There's a regular-status hierarchy you'll have to get used to, as you'll probably be served after people behind you in line. But it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Reminds me of the espresso/sports bars on Commercial Drive in Vancouver.  The espresso is medium Italian style roast and extracted with rapid machismo; bitter, creamy, and fresh.  Fotball is on a few screens scattered around, tight t-shirts and gold chains jostle and jabber at the front, tight jeans and plaid in back, and the families & friends out on the deck.  Fun, lively, and very popular."}
{"text":"Had their iced coffee and was immediately transported to Venice! There was a line for a reason. There is ample seating which includes a lovely enclosed outdoor space. We were full but their dessert selection looked wonderful as well. Next time."}
{"text":"After 2 years in Montreal, I finally made it to Café Olimpico. I ended up going on what was quite possibly the hottest and most humid day in recent memory, so I ditched my usual latte, instead getting a delightful treat called a crema di caffè, which is something between an espresso mousse and espresso soft serve. Yum!

The atmosphere is lively, so this isn't the place to get serious work done, but it's perfect for an afternoon of people watching or catching up with friends.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a nice coffee shop. I ordered the ice coffee. It was decent. There is outdoor space and indoor space. On nice day, its nice to seat outside.

You can access the wifi using code: Olimpico"}
{"text":"changes (for me) not necessarily for the better. They painted and updated but in doing so changed the ambiance considerably; in the gentrification they've striped away some of the Montreal character and McDonaldized it."}
{"text":"Such a busy cafe... at least when I stopped by. I liked their cappuccino - definitely a but bitter than the ones in other cafes in Montreal. Too bad they didn't have soy cappuccino. A great place to visit."}
{"text":"Worth the walk in freezing temps for warm cafe au lait and delicious chocolate pistachio biscotti. The staff was super friendly and they like to sing (on this particular morning 80s hits). This place is a like a bar with no booze. I want to chill here all day."}
{"text":"My goodness. I love this cafe. Came here early on a Saturday morning, and the vibe was calm, cool, and collected. The latte freddo was so good. It was iced slush coffee with milk. My boyfriend got lattee which was so creamy. Can't get enough of their coffee!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had mochas and the marbled chocolate cheesecake. So delicious! Would definitely recommend. I appreciated how quickly our drinks were made- we finished paying and a few seconds later our drinks were done!"}
{"text":"C est le meilleur endroit pour débuter ma journée 
L ambiance est sympas 
Les croissants tiède , le rock , jazz , le matin .
C est simplement bon 
C est 1/2 heure de détente
Petit changement

Je vais gentille ment me chercher un autre endroit pour boire mon latte 
Dommage"}
{"text":"Yum! Really enjoyed a latte freddo on a humid day! Really hit the spot and was refreshing. Their 3.75% or whatever milk is rich and creamy! Do they add sugar? Cause it tasted a little sweet! Delish! The energy from the staff was vibrant and they were very friendly with all customers. I can see how Olimpico may be a bit dark and dreary inside in the winter. But! The terrace is a fun spot in the summer; a unique row of benches rather than the usual table and chairs."}
{"text":"I forgot my laptop after having delicious coffee and tiramisu with my husband and mom. Luckily for me they saw it and kept it safe until I came back to pick it up!
Thank you very much Café olímpico!"}
{"text":"If dark roasted, Italian (speaking) espresso is your thing, Olimpico is the place for you. Crazy fun place. Great guys manning the joint. Low prices. Open early and late. CASH ONLY!

Nice selection of pastries and biscotti. Now serving gelato! BIG terrace.

Rating Scale:
1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  
2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?
3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.
4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.
5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance as well as their slushy latte. Slightly sweetened and perfect size. Wish parking was easier to find though."}
{"text":"apres gouter leur petit allongé, j'ai bien compris pourquoi il y a toujours bcp de monde. tres bon café!"}
{"text":"This is the first place that pops up when you're looking for coffee in Montreal. I was delighted to find small bottles of pear nectar (a favorite since childhood) so I grabbed one of those and went to order my usual soy latte. What? No soy milk? For some reason I threw caution to the wind. F*** it! And you know what? That was a mighty fine cappuccino."}
{"text":"Look out for the legit dude with the perfectly manicured handle bar mustache. Too legit to quite.
I had the perfect cafe latte.
My boyfriend said his espresso could have had a richer crema layer. Maybe he is more hipster than I thought he was? Don't knock it before you try it."}
{"text":"I had a hankerin for a cappuccino, and this place is just what I needed! Really delicious chocolate croissant as well. PLUS: the barista is kind when you try to order in French."}
{"text":"Love this place.

Fantastic espresso, cappuccino, or their unique, proprietary cafe crema imported from Italy (similar to coffee ice cream). Tremendous ambience with indoor and outdoor bench seating. The place is abuzz with energy, friendly and great staff, and is a wonderful people watching spot in the heart of Mile End. Muah."}
{"text":"I love Olimpico. It hands down my favourite coffee shop in the city for multiple reasons:

1. Sexy, Italian baristas

2. No bullshit coffee -- get your filtered coffee, soy lattes, tea etc. elsewhere. 

3. You're always bound to see a friendly face.

4. Fast service

5. It's affordable... I enjoy third wave coffee shops as much as the next person but my wallet dislikes forking $5 each time I want a latte. Here, it's $2.50

6. It rules St. Viateur in the summer time (and all those other seasons).

7. Their ice coffee is *muah* delicious.

8. Everyone that goes here is good looking. I'm not kidding! I never see any ugly people here. 

9. That terrace! It's where all the sun dwellers go. 

10. Their coffee is laced with the tears of Pope Francis."}
{"text":"Best coffee and croissants in North America."}
{"text":"Having just done a bagel run at Fairmont Bagel, just wanted a relaxing coffee on a no rush Sunday morning.  How lucky to stumble into this place. My latte is provided in a tall thin glass.  The ratio of milk to coffee was perfect.  This place takes the steaming of milk and the coffee prep to a level beyond nearly any cafe.  We also had a cappuccino that had a foam umbrella as good as it gets.
With comfortable seats and warm and friendly baristas, it was a perfect spot to start the day."}
{"text":"Awesome place with awesome staff and great espresso. I really liked this spot. Everyman type of coffee shop, cool but not pretentious. With the open windows on a beautiful September day made it even better. Also had a couple of TVs on with sports and news. Staff was very friendly and upbeat, made you feel welcome."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Montreal to get a perfect cappuccino. The ambience is great, buzzing with locals and neighbourhood regulars!"}
{"text":"Great Italian Cafe. Great coffee, decent tea, good atmosphere. Staff is fun. There's quite a bit of indoor seating and a great outdoor terrace."}
{"text":"Perfect simple breakfast cups and croissants aside, this place is what I envision every ideal coffee house to be: 

-- notable local history/lore
-- open, rustic interior
-- bar facing the street for people-ogling
-- newspapers
-- an owner/barista who waives the full cost because this dumb cheap American with his powerful U.S. dollar didn't bring enough cash 
-- who then refuses it when I bring the rest of the cash later
-- and who serenades his regular customers when they enter in in the morning, to everyone's amusement

While I would have lost it for the option of having a regular cup of coffee, just everything about this visit was perfect. All I ask for in life is to start my day with a coffee and croissant in a place where people are happy or getting happier, and where everything feels real, authentic. 

Olimpico delivers."}
{"text":"Meh! I've had good caffè experiences but let me tell you something. If you have not made it to Olimpico yet then your are missing out on genuine greatness - I mean it! 

Paesan, after briefly waiting in line for a few minutes, distracted by the soccer jerseys and hockey banners, a masterfully prepared and aromatic cappuccino was laid down on the counter, just begging for me to enjoy. Without hesitation I proceeded to the best seats at this fine establishment, which in my opinion are the tall bar stools behind the granite counters facing out the street in the wide open patio windows. Here you can breathe in the fresh spring air and watch early risers walk on St-Viateur street in the Mile End district for hours.

Here's a secret tip for you... to avoid the line ups, come here on Saturday mornings! The hustle and bustle atmosphere is intoxicating with baristas calling and whistling at their guests, gorgeous donnas lining up for their preferred coffee to go, 80s tunes playing in the background, young parents with their bambinos chuckling along, regulars chatting across the coffee bar and bursting into passionate conversations next to the monstrous coffee machine, what's there not to love? 

Me I'm convinced in my brain that this place will be here for generations to come - that's for sure. The talented baristas here serve great coffee, the people are friendly, the location is central. Sometimes we forget that the best things in life are simple and we should remind ourselves to stop and savor the moment.

Vince and Forde, molto grazie (thank you) for keeping it real and helping shape this Montreal institution for all to enjoy. Now I go to my next destination but I swear, I will come back, perhaps with my buddy Alessandro. Hope to see you again soon soon!"}
{"text":"Their coffee is good. But: their iced coffee is other-worldy. The stuff in the ice-swooshing machine that is in constant motion. It's mind-blowing, at least for the first five minutes. Once the ice melts it is just average. But between the time you get it and the time the ice melts, it is a as sublime an iced coffee as is possible in the mortal world."}
{"text":"A must stop on our weekend cycling route.  Always packed, great coffees ( ice coffees as well) good place to watch soccer on weekends"}
{"text":"If there was ever a time for me to use the word bona fide, it'd be here. This café serves the best coffee in the city according to me, my sister, and the people, for the people. 

Before you step in, you best be prepared:

1. Expect a line (but it moves quick).
2. Know your order before you get to the front. They don't like dawdlers.
3. Skip the pastries.*

*I just added step 3. This past weekend I decided to try a scone. Whoops, we all make mistakes.

A cappuccino and latte for my sister and me. Respective perfection."}
{"text":"Cool friendly place, nice staff and excellent espresso, however they really would benefit from using soymilk for us lactose intolerant people otherwise it's just doubleshot or americano."}
{"text":"I loved their cappuccino. It was so good that i went there twice on the same day. I also enjoyed the overall experience. The staff was friendly. They were playing nice songs."}
{"text":"RUDE baristas. Need I say more?
It's a shame to see a place become so popular that they feel the way they treat their customers doesn't matter. But apparently that's the case with Café Olimpico.

It was the two musclebound young men on the counter yesterday. In the two minutes I stood in front of them, I was literally scolded by one barista for saying I wanted a bottle of water. (He pulled out a plastic one and I wanted one of their refillable glass ones.) Then I heard the other barista dish on the woman in front of me for deciding to leave them an extra dollar in change before walking away! (She had already tipped them.) REALLY guys? You're complaining about a customer leaving you an extra dollar tip? 

Café Olimpico serves as the hipster Ground Zero of the Mile End neighborhood in Montreal and as such, their customer base is secure. Business is brisk and the service is brusque and unfriendly. The coffee is great, but I would never set foot in there again."}
{"text":"Cafe Olimpico is a staple in Montreal for anyone who is a coffee lover. This place has the best tasting lattes I have ever had. I do not know where they get their espresso from but WOW. Once you go, you will be hooked and wanting to go back again and again. There is no question why Cafe Olimpico has managed to stay open for so many years after first opening in 1970. One of the best things about this place is that it stays open until midnight almost every night of the week while most coffee shops in Montreal close around 7pm."}
{"text":"By far the best coffee I've had in my life! Much cheaper than the other places I've been too and better! Awesome location in Mile End as well. The barista is a little intimidating but incredibly efficient. They have plenty of cakes and pastries to get with your coffee. My friend got the carrot cake and she said it was the best she has ever had. I ordered the Mochaccino and it was so smooth! I really enjoyed my experience there. I wouldn't really classify it as a place to sit and do work all day because there's much more of a \"go-go-go\" atmosphere (at least the day I was there) but I did see people working. Highly recommend and it's a must for Montréal coffee!"}
{"text":"Wooo! Haven't been here in a decade and it's kept the old world charm despite some very elegant upgrades. This visit we were lucky enough to stop in during World Cup  - right as Uruguay scored on Portugal and half the packed house went nuts - crazy fun! Crazy packed! People are spilling out into the street and overflowing the sunny patio despite the 28° heat. Once we nudged our way to the bar (line starts at the back of house) we got some magical coffee ice cream latte concoction -- delicious but next I'd save the latte filler and just get the coffee ice cream straight, it was magnificent."}
{"text":"I was expecting a good high end third wave cafe and was disappointed. (If your expectations are different, maybe you'll enjoy it.)
Sunday at noontime visit. The place is crowded and extremely loud, with bassy pop hits blaring. Families, bros, hipsters, and couples.
Dimly lit room framed with TVs playing sports. Is this a bar?? (There is quieter outdoor seating which contains only benches, no tables. Hold on to your saucers!!) ~15min wait in a line that curved through the place almost to the door.
I had a macchiato with biscotti. The espresso was well made but the coffee tasted like dark Italian stuff. Meh.."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is Amazing...I was there on Sunday
Friendly & nice Baristas
Lines a little long but worth the wait
Had a Caffe Fredo aka an Ice Coffee and it was delicious"}
{"text":"Oh well... The coffee is consistently good. The staff has an attitude that adds color to the place if you're not the target of their quirky temper. And the overall vibe is good, even though the place is very, very dark.

If you've got friends there or enjoy the whole Mile-End hipster-on-a-budget scene, then the inevitable lineups might be worth your time. Otherwise, do come in as early as you can."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, would come back. The lemon/pistachio biscotti was tasty. The crema cappuccino soft serve was amazing."}
{"text":"Good day to walk around mile end after Christmas not warm and not cold.  Stopped in too get an expresso a double to be exact.  Olympic lives up to the hype interesting decor makes you feel like your in your home town in Italy.  Good expresso great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best cappuccino in town. Love the vibe and atmosphere. The barista was very friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Location: Mile End - like I mentioned in my Fabergé review, you'll either need to drive and hope to God that you find a parking spot, or use public transit, which in this case, will be a bus. 

The place: I'm going to Italy in June so I can't really compare Olimpico to the caffés in Rome, but when I walked in, I FELT like this is what Rome will be like so I used the experience as practice. Capisce? For a brief moment, I was in Rome, away from the cold and the white crap that Mother Nature decided to dump on us on what was allegedly Day 2 of Spring. Ahh bliss. Anyway, moving along.... so I walked in and immediately noticed two things: extremely dim lighting and brown. Lots of brown. I might be mistaken, but I'm pretty sure the decor is the same as when it originally opened. Not that I mind - I was going for the caffé. 

Service: First of all, there was a line-up when I walked in, and there was a line-up when I walked out. The place is constantly busy so be prepared to exercise some patience. The Barristas are not stressed out or in a hurry - they prepare each order slowly and diligently. Though slow, they are extremely talented at making that perfect cup of coffee. I had the best Macchiato EVER, right here. Too bad I only decided to get coffee beans after I finished my Macchiato - I had to get in line all over again. 

I don't know what it's like during the week, but on a Saturday, it's busy as all hell so don't expect to get a table unless you arrive at the butt-crack of dawn. That said, in the Summer (does that still exist?), they also have a terrace that you can use. 

Their prices are really decent - the Macchiato was $2.25 and a 500g bag of coffee cost me $15 - about $4-5 less than other places. They'll even grind your beans for you - just tell them what you're using the coffee for (Espresso, French Press etc.).

Lastly, they had these delicious looking donuts that I wish I had tried. One of the guys took the top off the plate because the guy in front of me ordered one, and I was instantly hypnotized by the delectable scent that drifted into my nostrils. Mmmm yummo!

Olimpico is an Montreal institution so if you're in the area, you have to go. They open at 7 a.m. and according to their sign, they're 'open in da night' too. Awesome."}
{"text":"Love these guys! Charming spot, okay coffee, very montreal vibez, outdoor seating for your summer day hangouts... the allongée avec lait is my go-to staple."}
{"text":"I had been here years ago when friends and then-residents were showing me around. I've spent many a trip to Montreal since trying to remember both the name of the coffee shop and the location, and finally, while happening to stay in this very neighbourhood, I found this place again! Although my ignorance and non-localness sets me apart, I wish I was a local who could frequent this place all the time. 

Amazing coffee; delicious-looking baked goods, free wifi, and a gorgeous patio space."}
{"text":"This is as close you can get to a real italian coffee bar. It's not a third wave coffee shop. Nobody will serve you a chemex with coffee roasted yesterday, and you will not have any cupping sessions. It is also the complete opposite of Starbucks. Nobody will care if you're lactose intolerant here, just drink your espresso black, it's great as it is. Ain't no time to be bothered with skimmed milk when we all know most of you will eat a sugary pastry with it. You get in line and you better know what you need and you better keep it simple. That's what I love about this place."}
{"text":"Le meilleur café à Montréal. Toujours achalandé. La file d'attente peut paraître longue, mais le service est rapide et le café en vaut tellement la peine."}
{"text":"After getting bagels at Fairmont, my bf and I ducked in here on our way to St. Viateur (cause obviously you have to try both of the top-rated bagel places to confirm which one is the best). I had heard a lot about Olimpico and their stellar coffees so I really wanted to give their drinks a try, despite not being a huge coffee drinker (I prefer tea to coffee any day). Well, let's just say that if all cafes served coffee as well as Olimpico does, I'd be converted to a coffee-lover overnight. I ordered the café allongé avec lait (otherwise known as a lungo, in Italian, this is a long or stretched or slow-dripped espresso). It was perfectly creamy, with just the right amount of sugar. Usually, when I ask baristas (especially those in the US) to add sugar to my coffee, they overdo it. This was simply a cup of heaven. Rich without being overpoweringly bitter, smooth, creamy, nutty, earthy, and ending on a subtle but bright sweet note. It was truly the best coffee/espresso/latte I've ever had!

Drinks: 4/5 -- fantastic! Coffee like you've never had it before!
Service: 5/5 -- very friendly, jovial, welcoming, accommodating (they accepted US dollars), and quick/efficient (without sacrificing the quality of the drinks)
Atmosphere: 4/5 -- open, spacious, casual, though I can see it turning into a somewhat pub-ish atmosphere during events, sports games, etc.; It's definitely not your cute, read-a-book, living room-esque cafe

Overall: 4.5/5 --fantastic coffee shop!"}
{"text":"The hot chocolate is really good here. It's such a nice place to grab a coffee. The staff is nice and in the summer, sitting outside is the best."}
{"text":"Tres bon café.  Ambiance relax.  Prix abordable  staff chill. Rien de superficielle. Excellent piur l'étude, discuter entre ami et meme rencontrer du nouveau monde !"}
{"text":"If you like a neighborhood type of coffee shop with plenty of personality and local flavor, this is the place for you.  Even my wife, who isn't a fan of these places remarked that it was a great hangout.  
I had a latte and she had a hot chocolate.  Both beverages were excellent.   We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed the atmosphere.  Next time we're in town, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 15 years( before it was trendy) Cafe latte is 3$ tip included (it was 2$ when I first came here). 
Terasse is directly in the sun which will definitely give you cancer!
 Too many beautiful people chillin in the sun. 
I definitely don't recommend this place. 
Please stay away! 
This place is too crowded as it is! 
Everyone is artsy fartsy type !!!
 Don't believe the hype. 
New poeple are not welcomed here. 
The staff is aggresive and will probably spill salt in ur coffee....while ur distracted looking at all the hotties around. 
My verdict is this place cant be beat but you won't like it. It's too cheap. Too chill.  Too sunny. Too friendly!!!

Don't ever come here, you might like it so  much you'll be back all the time and the lineup will become even worse!"}
{"text":"One of Montreal's most respected coffee shops, it is the quintessential Italian Café. A few pastries, some Gelato, and coffee. That's really all they serve folks! The espressos are amazing, as are most of their milk based drinks. The coffee has a perfect balance of bitter and acidic taste, and it is always at the perfect temperature. Great service even when it's hectic.

inexpensive too.

Special shout-out to their cortado, especially in the afternoon."}
{"text":"This feels like the best coffee shop in Montreal. I don't know what they put in the coffee but it is amazing. Great local hangout. All the diversity of Mile End in one spot."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. But the coffee has declined, is near awful now. (...I don't understand the recent reviews saying the coffee is good -- it really isn't...) Also, it used to be seedy in a delightful way, but is now just a drab sports-bar-type place. The only remaining charm comes from its function as a neighborhood social hub.

Tip:

-they are relaxed enough that you can bring bagels in, and eat with your coffee. You'll make a mess, but just clean up afterwards.

-if you *want* to watch the game with a coffee, this might be your place."}
{"text":"I still don't understand the magic of Olympico. Everybody in Montreal knows the place. The crowd is a mix of artists, intellectuals, students,... and soccer aficionados. The speak Italian, French and English. The walls are covered by sport related artifacts, and Vito knows 85% of his customers' names. That day where I made it to the list is still one of the happiest of my life. Now, I can walk in the Olympico, knowing that someone will scream \"Salut Christine! Un latte pour emporter? Un sucre?\" Vito knows his shit. 

Situated in the Mile-End (the trendiest neighborhood of Montreal... beginning to look a little bit too much like Williamsburg to my own taste...) it's definitely worth the detour. Come during the weekend, in the morning on weekdays or during a sport championship of some sort for a typical experience!!! :)"}
{"text":"On a cool sunny day in Montreal, my fiancé and I are the ultimate tourist wondering around the city. We ordered a latte and a shot of espresso, but I only have 4.95 Canadian money in exact change. The owner and the barista were so nice and took the money I had even though I was 5 cent short. They were both singing to the 90s American songs while making our coffee. What a friendly cafe! Latte is great and the espresso is smooth and flavorful!"}
{"text":"Coffee is OK. Service and atmosphere were friendly, if a bit New Yorkish. Why 3 stars? I like putting my own freaking sugar in my coffee! Is there a sugar shortage in Montreal that only they can do it?"}
{"text":"Here we have the other tie for the best cappuccino in Montreal (in my opinon).  I can't believe Mr. Handlbar mustache can turn out a cappuccino as fast as he does and still make it as good as he does.  And I think I'm a pretty hard sell!

The 3 visits made to Olimpico were always a 2 cuppa trip and worth the wait in the speedy line.

Mr. Mustachio must be come un ballerino because he makes that 30lb tamp look like someone checking their watch for the time.

Bravo, Bravo, Olimpico!!"}
{"text":"We went for a late night affogato with my friend who is visiting from out of town. They were so gracious and made a delicious drink. They have an outdoor patio that's just perfect for summer evening. They also have a TV that was playing the Olympics. We got to watch Michael Phelps when one of his metals! Had a great time here and would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great ambience - the staff are very friendly. 
Nothing bad to say about this place. 

I simple had a tea and a piece of tiramisu - which was yummy and so cute packaged!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in town, plus you can bring food from outside to eat here, what more could you ask for?

Oh, if you're a fan of Italian league soccer, there is always something playing!"}
{"text":"Bon café et ambiance de feux ! Ce petit café de Quartier, vous mettra dans l'esprit du Mile End! De plus, il diffuse des Événements Sportif."}
{"text":"Simply fabulous, cool, hot! I try not to go on sundays due to the long lines, but it moves quickly. Oh and truly Italian coffee quality! No ma, veramente!"}
{"text":"Je suis entièrement #TeamOlimpico, bien que je me fasse souvent rabrouer par les fans du Club Social, un peu plus loin sur St-Viateur. 

On n'y va pas pour s'asseoir à l'intérieur, mais bien pour profiter de la grande terrasse où les gens sont assis côte à côte (parfait pour un bain de foule) ou sur notre chemin pour se promener dans le Mile End. La queue est toujours longue, mais elle rapetisse en un clin d'oeil tellement les baristas sont experts et rapides.

Les prix sont extrêmement bas, et le café, furieusement bon. Un incontournable du quartier."}
{"text":"Saw this place on a couple of blogs and on here (of course!) so after picking up my bagels at St-Viateurs and looking down the street and seeing lo and behold, Cafe Olimpico was right down the street from it, I was excited to go to one of the higher reccomended places for caffinated goodness. 

Through some of the tips I saw to get the Cafe Frappe.... wasn't exactly sure what this was and after recieving it the best description I have for it that people would understand is its a Coffee Slushie. And boy oh boy was it good.... you can get it with milk but if you do like your coffee strong (I do) don't bother with the milk... its already sweetened so its not gonna be super bitter at all, just really nice when u need a pick me up and a little bit of coldness on a hot summer day. I really enjoyed this and I want to try more next time and have a sit down and relax time in there..... Try it out, it lives up to most the hype no doubt."}
{"text":"A few highlights: 
a) There's usually a line of 15+ people, but fear not, it moves VERY quickly
b) Great cappuccino for 2.5$, what I usually get. Never disappointed
c) Run by Italian, the owner remembers you if you frequent enuf
d) Spacious place with very sportif decoration, TVs set up for soccer/football games. 
e) Mixed clientèle, hipsters, soccer/football fans, families with kids, adults age ranging from 20-60. It gets loud and always packed. 
f) Opens late, another +

This is definitely the go-to place if you live in mile-end. or just pass by grab a coffee take a stroll in mile-end"}
{"text":"Café Olimpico is now without a doubt my favorite café for strictly coffee and desserts in Montréal. With its longer operating hours than most cafés and a lively, rustic indoor environment with people scattered everywhere, it makes for a great place to chill with your friends at almost any time of the day. I ordered a cappuccino and a cannoli and they were both executed perfectly. The cappuccino was not acidic at all and was warm and soothing with the addition of the milk. The cannoli was probably the best one I've had in my life, as its delicate outside carried the perfect crunch to counter the whipped cream center and delightful powdered sugar. Overall, it carried just the right amount of sweetness. I will definitely come back again once I've visited all of the restaurants/cafes on my bucket list (I'm nearing the end of it so yay!)."}
{"text":"great no frills cafe.  outdoor seating is great, indoor tables are fantastic for gnoshing bagels from down the block.  i knocked back iced latte after iced latte while in from outta town visiting -  great find."}
{"text":"Cute baristas, great coffee, super strong Wifi, a great outdoor patio to people watch, what more do you need?"}
{"text":"Really good coffee joint that didn't disappoint particularly having such a high reputation with the locals. Great taste, good pricing, fast and friendly service. All the fixings. I enjoyed my cappuccino so much that I even bought a bag of their coffee beans and have been grinding away at that bag over the last few months. 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Delicious cappuccino in a cool area. Plenty of seating although it does get busy. The baristas did a great job of getting through the long line very quickly when I was there. 

Just a heads up, it is cash only."}
{"text":"Avec le Pikolo, meilleur espresso en ville. Attention, ce n'est pas un endroit reposant! Événements sportifs diffusés en tout temps sur les nombreux écrans de la place, discussions animées entre habitués et visiteurs, décor qui sort de l'ordinaire (on se croirait dans un vestiaire de foot d'une équipe italienne) ! Super terrasse qui permet de profiter du soleil en se gâtant les papilles gustatives. À voir et surtout à savourer."}
{"text":"The silkiest foam I've ever encountered in a cappuccino. Café Olimpico is a busy coffee shop, but still manages to surpass the rest in speed and delivery. Despite a line-up, they operate quick, taking orders and crafting coffees like true espresso professionals. Never before have I had a cappuccino so melt-in-your-mouth amazing, so soft and aromatic, that I found myself dreaming of it months later. It seems I've developed a crush on a coffee in another city.

I will be in Montreal again shortly and will attempt to go out of my way to return to this Italian cafe, my new love, complete with its old world charm and marvellously manicured moustache-laden baristas. I have yet to find a Toronto equivalent."}
{"text":"This is one of the busiest espresso bars I have ever experienced and for good reason. First of all, it is unabashedly Italian in every way - no chain or mixed messages here. It is emblazoned with Italian soccer flags and TVs are set on soccer. The staff is all Italian and they take pride in their work. With a line of 20 to 30 curling around the pool table (??), the barista calls out for advanced orders - be ready or get the evil eye! It's easy to order, they only serve classic Italian preparations: iced blended coffee drinks should look elsewhere. They crank it out fast and well on two 3-group FAEMA Non-Stops and serve it in the right drinkware. Go to the standup bar or sit at the small tables or go linger on the terrace. At Olimpico you get the best espresso drink in Montreal and a short trip to Italy all in one."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious lattes, great old-school atmosphere, fun people watching, and fun/unique, though sometimes awkwardly configured outdoor seating.  

Stop, Savor, Repeat."}
{"text":"If I had written this review yesterday I would have given it a 2 but today it hit a 4.  The difference?  Yesterday I ordered a cappuccino, no cinnamon, no chocolate and couldn't find a seat nor did I order any food.  Today I ordered the same cappuccino, no cinnamon, no chocolate and a chocolate chip dough and nutella doughnut plus I had my choice of where to sit.  For those that are coffee lovers, don't expect this to be the creamy concoctions or artfully poured beverages you're used to.  This is old-school but done well.  It is a traditional Italian style coffee bar and if you just give it a chance it will embrace you just like it does all the neighborhood regulars.  Expect to see the same guys working behind the bar but they do it with panache and it won't take them long to remember what you order.  I had 5 people in front of me today and without asking what anyone wanted the barista rattled off what they would order!  I'm impressed and I'll be back tomorrow!

Oh and just a few tips...bring cash as I'm not sure they accept anything else, don't expect to get much work done here as the environment is lively and if you are easily upset by things that others say don't sit near the bar....did I mention the place is lively?"}
{"text":"Cafe Olimpico was founded by Rocco Furfaro and has been around since 1970.  I love their little story where there was a sign that stated this cafe was 'Open Day and Night' - however, as years passed by, a few letters dropped and it read 'Open Da Night' - a fond nickname that now has stuck.  Nestled in the Mile End area, this little cafe has small little bistro tables and a large coffee bar that offers different beverage varieties.  I stopped by to get a cup of espresso, and as other espresso stops, this was also strong and more on the bitter end.  I was a little disappointed that the cup was only filled 1/4, rather than the typical 1/2 portion.  The baristas here are friendly and seem to have a great time - you stand in line up by the coffee bar and just order; you then pay, and since your beverage is made-to-order, you wait until you receive your cup.  There seems to be plenty of seats, and there are additional seats out in their little patio.  However, there is no exit from the patio, so the only way to exit is to come back inside the cafe again to leave through their main entrance.  

+espresso cup not filled properly T___T
+order, pay, and wait in line for your beverages
+friendly baristas
+plenty of seats inside and on their patio available
+no exit from the patio"}
{"text":"I wish I could have loved this place, but I feel it was too hyped up. The atmosphere was great, but where they fell flat was their product. I got a caffe freddo, which filled up 3/4ths of a small plastic cup. It was a coffee icee. I don't know what I was expecting exactly, but maybe that's because I've only seen Peets freddos, which tend to be large and sugary. 

Anyway, perhaps this was my fault and I should have stuck with some of the classics. Still, for two dollars this was a huge ripoff."}
{"text":"Hot chocolates were great. Warmed us up after stroll in cold rain"}
{"text":"I plan to be back this week once back in town. 
Olimpico - great spot all year round. Summer time - killer outdoor terrace
This spot will also light up and grow quite chaotic yet fun this summer during World Cup. Big screens will surely be mounted inside and out. 
Oh yea, GREAT coffee btw - hehe. And the dudes preparing the coffee here know exactly what they are doing and don't forget a name !"}
{"text":"Love this place, good baked goods, excellent mocha, and I like their house blend of beans which we bring back to Ontario and make espresso with at home.  Right around the corner from St-Viateur and Fairmount bagels too"}
{"text":"Cozy bustling Italian ambiance. Order a cup of cappuccino and let it transport you to another decade in time. Loved the enthusiastic Baristas! 
If you have a sweet tooth, definitely give the tiramisu a try. Creamy and fluffy, but dense. Perfection in a cup!!!"}
{"text":"What a cool cafe!  I stopped in here for a tea and to catch the end of a US Open match and marveled at the fact that in the 1.5 hrs that I sat there, the lineup was always consistently long.  My wife said the coffee was indeed excellent so I guess we stumbled into the right place.  Big screen TVs, free wireless, good tea and coffee... what's not to like!"}
{"text":"Exceptional coffee beverages....lattes done just right. No wonder there's a massive queue (no worries, it moves fast). Also, they've got ample indoor seating and a patio too. 

I noticed garcon carrying a tray of fresh-baked croissants; I regret not ordering one--they looked pro. Ditto the mini donuts at the front counter, one of which was maple bacon (!)...why oh why didn't I buy one?

Food regret. Is there anything worse? ;)"}
{"text":"Rares sont les commerces où l'on rentre et on sent immédiatement l'esprit communautaire d'un quartier. Ben, au Café Olimpico, c'est le cas! Un excellent lieu de rassemblement en été, sur la terrasse, comme en hiver, c'est un commerce qui exude la nature même de la communauté du Mile End. 

Et le café? Malade! Leur latte fait facilement mon top 5 montréalais. Et à $2,50, comme l'émission le dit, \"The price is Right\"! 

p.s. Amateur de foot? Ici, tu pourras écouter toute coupe et chaque match de l'Italie."}
{"text":"If you're spending time reading the reviews, you're wasting time not drinking this coffee. 5 stars. Boom. Enough said."}
{"text":"No fuss, best coffee in Montréal. Perfect espresso, delicious lattés, and won't cater in anyway to any special needs: no soy milk, no skim milk, no small talk. This is the anti-Starbucks. Run exclusively by Italian men, this loud and soccer-obsessed café located in Hipster County (aka Mile End), often has long line-ups but I promise it's well worth the wait every time. For $2.50 a latté, you can afford to have two but the coffee's so strong you can only handle one."}
{"text":"I was so happy to see an Italian cafe in a sea of frenchies. Since we're from NJ, Italian anything is my comfort zone. I ordered a tea and panettone and my husband had a cappuccino and a variety of pastries. Though the cannoli was made with whipped cream???? He seemed to enjoy it.
The bathroom was filthy and the barista ignored me when I was trying to place my order, so I'm only giving 4 stars.
We may return."}
{"text":"This place has a slamming hot chocolate and that's really all you need to know. 

Friendly, no-thrills but homey kinda café. I'm sure this place gets a little crazy when sports are on the tv, but that can be fun too in a non-bar scenario. I'm hard pressed to think of a place left in NY that'll let you do something like that without buying a beer."}
{"text":"I have ridiculous love and standards for italian coffee, even though I'm not italian. Cafe Olimpico keps to the true coffee bar style, and got us our orders fast. My friend loved his drink so much, he's keeps looking for something like it wherever we go. 

Very cozy inside, and it made me unbelievably happy to see the football flags up everywhere. As everyone else has said, the patio is excellent, but it was raining when we were there so we didn't get to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a cappuccino. Pretty busy! casual and friendly. A spot where I would hang out if I lived in the area. 

The drinks were great. Best we had in Montreal. They also had some beignet/donuts which looked delicious. Next time! Free Wi-Fi and nice outside seating also available."}
{"text":"I am lucky - my in-laws are only a block from Olympico. Whenever I am in Montreal, I have to drop into Olympico for their latte or expresso. The coffees have a rich deep flavor and the baristas are very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is about as hipster as you can get and seems to be one of those places where if you don't know what you want, you won't receive good service.  If you're looking for a nice quiet cafe, then this is probably not the place for you.  

The smell of smoke wafting inside the cafe gave my wife a headache along with all the noise.  We showed up on a day where neither my wife or I were feeling like being around a lot of people.  With that being said, if I lived here, I think I would be here often.

Based on coffee alone, this place is one of the best I've had.  We both got mochaccinos and they were rich and full-bodied deliciousness.  Our curly moustachioed barista gave them a nice presentation as well as he poured the steamed milk in front of us into tall clear glasses.  

The loud atmosphere wouldn't always be my style, but it would be a great place for people watching.  Even if I wasn't in the mood to hang out there, I could drink coffee from this place every day."}
{"text":"I have only nice things to say about this cafe with exception of- I wish I lived closer to it! Perfect latte, in every way. The most delicious little donut. A long line that moved quickly. A good amount of seating both inside and outside, though I don't know when is a good time to arrive for indoor seating because the place was packed when I was there. This place is going to make it hard to drink coffee anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I'll be looking for a coffee shop with these same feels back home. If I lived in Montreal, you would find me here daily!! The place is pretty laid back and definitely has that cool European, sipping espresso, crossed leg, chatting thing going. 

There was a line on a Sunday morning, but it moved quickly. The smiling, friendly barista who greeted you warmly and with lots of contagious energy at the front made it all worth the wait. He knew almost everyone's name in the place! It definitely has the small town neighborhood feel. Oh, and it's customary to tip the cheery man behind the counter .50 or more so add that to the price of your beverage. 

They offer nothing fancy here, just good old fashion fantastic grinds, cafe au lat, cappuccinos in a few varieties and espressos. No dairy free milks available as it's a very traditional Italian cafe so I opted for just a house brew, black and it was very good! (That to me is how you can tell the quality of a coffee, if you can go at it with nothing masking the actual taste.) They have cannoli, tiramisu, carrot cake and biscotti ready to go as well. 

The place has old fashion hammered tin ceilings, bar seats by the big front window, bistro tables and is darker by the back, a seat for everyone. There's also apparently a cute courtyard which I did not see. There were families with littles, people getting work done, couples and groups. It's a nice spot for everyone.  

They're big on soccer so if that's you're thing, head here for a game. Although it's not a bar, I can see this place getting pretty fun during a game they have playing on one of their flat-screens. Lots of obvious Italian pride here! 

Ugh this place made me roll my eyes at our chain coffee spots back in the states. It's so just not the same! Not fair! It made me realized just how rushed life back home is. Come here if you're used to the places like that. Such a very nice change of pace here! 

Oh, and it's conveniently located down the block from St Viateur Bagels. Make a stop at both, and you literally have the perfect morning. People were outside on the benches out front, chatting and indulging in the things that make both of the places so popular. Just lovely!"}
{"text":"Pool, swarthy, manly baristos who pull stiff coffee drinks from their lovingly abused beast of an espresso machine, a sunny stone courtyard with tree stumps and odd benches where locals squeeze their bums together smoking outside, even in the bitter cold. A Mile End Montreal institution. Olimpico serves what may be the epitome of Montreal lattes - there are lots of other good similar ones, but you get the sense while you're there that to bother with any other would be a ridiculous waste of time. 

If you are postering, just ask at the counter if you can put your materials up outside, last time I was doing this they stamped the poster so it didn't get pulled down until after the event was over, which I thought was  sweet move."}
{"text":"A classic in the Mile-End.

Very friendly & knowledgable staff when it comes to anything coffee or coffee-related. Lots of Italian specialities and a very tight-knit, community-oriented space. Always worth a visit in the area."}
{"text":"I asked for soy because I'm lactose intolerant and the barista was extremely snooty and rude about it (\"We don't *do* that.\"). The guy's ego was almost as big as his moustache.  I guess I get that it's a 'no frills' place/coffee purist destination/whatever, but there's really no need to alienate me because I have an intestinal condition."}
{"text":"A lot of hype for a place that serves an OK espresso. Of course when you compare to the average coffee place, it is better and the Italo-Canadian staff is definitely playing on their reputation. That's good for business and especially with tourists.

Nice terrace where you can sip your coffee without the indoor blasting TV."}
{"text":"Fantastic espresso + open late night = win.

Strong shot with the perfect amount of crema. I can't really justify 5 stars, but it's pretty damn close. There wasn't quite the depth of flavor that I've found in espressos from Stumptown or Four Barrel, but almost.

Classic sports bar turned coffee shop. Kinda strange, but pretty awesome. I miss the late night coffee shops...SF really lacks them. A great spot to chill with a friend if you don't feel like dealing with the pretentious atmosphere so ever-present in many coffee shops. And yes, I realize the rest of this review is fairly pretentious, but I can't help it if coffee has become the nectar that guides me through life."}
{"text":"Really great espresso drinks.  The latte (perfect balance of espresso, milk, and foam) is my personal favorite but their regular coffee is very good, as well.  The coffee is full-bodied with a good aroma.  It's a good place to people-watch, if you can find outdoor seating on a warm day.  Prices are pretty inexpensive, too."}
{"text":"Great coffee spot in Mile End, Montreal! We enjoyed excellent lattes while taking a break from the cold!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on my way for some fresh bagels and the coffee didn't disappoint. What sticks out about this cafe and this neighbourhood is the very apparent culture in the way shops are set up, the way people act and dress, and the distinct attitudes of almost everyone. This place reeks of Montreal and it's fantastic. So if you're from out of town, waltz on by this place on a Sunday morning to do some people watching and make sure to stop by here for your coffee needs."}
{"text":"It's quite popular for the area. Was curious to check it out. I read rave reviews for the cannolis! But unfortunately, they make that only during the weekends and I went on a Monday. 
The latté and hot chocolate were decent. Nothing extraordinary that I will remember. The biscotti was a disappointment :(
The ambiance is friendly and open. I guess it's a popular place to work/hangout and catch up with pals. 
Overall, if you don't live in the area, no need to make a special trip to check this place out.. I hope that someday I can change this review after trying the famous cannolis ;)"}
{"text":"Café Olimpico is arguably one of the most famous coffee shops in Montreal, and it's deservedly so because the coffee they serve up is just pure awesome. 

Be prepared to be served some very super duper unique lattes by the beautiful gentlemen behind the counter. Unlike the gourmet lattes you find in most coffee shops, the ones here are uniquely Italian style. It's creamy and rich in coffeeness at the same time and in perfect harmony (kinda like Opera singers, yea). The lattes are also super cheap compared to most places ($2 - $3 the last I checked).

The decor and staff will in no way hold back any of that Italian pride. The shop is filled with Italian football flags and jerseys, and most of the staff conduct themselves in full Italian hipster style.

Hipster? Yes, very much so."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the neighbourhood I can't help stopping by Café Olimpico... Honestly, sometimes I go out of my way just to stop by Café Olimpico. Today's visit included a latte and hazelnut biscotti - it made a cold day feel very warm. Can't wait for summer so I can enjoy their iced coffee - the best MTL has to offer."}
{"text":"Cafe Olimpico represents a cornerstone of Mille end Montreal!  Every great urban neighbourhood needs a great coffee bar/hangout/local establishment/place to watch Habs games/place to watch World Cup or Euro football. 

Donald Trump is a fervent preacher of location...location...location!  You can't get a better street corner location in the heart of Mille End (quickly becoming one of my favourite neighbourhoods)!  

On this fine spring day I came here after a lunch down the street and wanted to pop in for a Cap (Cappuccino) to go.  Well, to my amazement game 2 of the second round playoffs of Habs vs. Bruins was on and the place was packed to the gills!  With every move or mistake you could hear the crowd cheer or moan!  Awesome atmosphere!  The crowd was mostly men some sportin Canadiens Jersey's some just looked like they woke up!  Awesome energy!!!  The corner cafe represents an important place in many people's lives as it provides the fuel to keep many of us going!  

Back to my cap, for $2.50 you can't go wrong!  Flavour is medium...not too strong.. and even though I waited in line for a while it was well worth it!  You don't experience the feeling that you get at Cafe Olimpico at a Second Cup, Tim Horton's or Starbucks!  These mega corporations strive to bottle and sell what CO can deliver and exceed!  

A true institution!  Come by....you shan't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A perfect authentic espresso macchiato (just a drop of steamed milk, not half a cup...) in a friendly, unpretentious, no-frills Mile End neighborhood cafe. Best coffee spot in Montreal."}
{"text":"Bonjour Montreal! I found this charming coffee place on a Yelp search. Only one opened at 7am on a Sunday morning. Great croissants, amazing coffee. Oui, Madame! Ca va bien!

Super funny and charm, yes, the two super stars baristas... you guessed it right! 

My only complaint: AC was too cold, when the outdoor temperature was chilly.  Or maybe it was just me that still had the tropics running through my veins. 

This place was so good, me and my friend came two days in a row. 

I'm going to miss their coffee. And the Barista with the Salvador Dali mustache..."}
{"text":"this place was highly reccomended by many servers in many restraunts in montreal and by the concierge at the hotel i was staying at for the week. a nice bus ride out of the downtown core and into the upper end of Montreal's Mile End neighborhood - a nice neighborhood cafe. the line moved very fast and the morning cappucino i had was very well made - the cafe was just right - not bitter and very smooth - and gave me the morning boost i needed. they got skills. very laid back and the outdoor seating and the eccentric neighborhood feel - made it a memorable start to the day. the biscotti was ok - kind of stale - so i'd stick to the cafe drinks. prices are also not too bad. wifi - i don't think they had free wifi but you can probably connect to someone willing to share their internet connection in the neighborhood if your lucky.

i reccommend if you are taking the bus or the subway and its not winter to rent one of the bixi bikes and bike here since it is a little over 1/2 a mile... unless your in the mood for a nice walk."}
{"text":"I didn't really drink coffee before.  And then I visited Cafe Olimpico to watch a soccer game on their big screen. The rest is history..."}
{"text":"An institution in the fine city of Montreal, Olimpico is to coffee as Schwartz is to meat. No frills, no soy milk, no bamboo benches, no yuppie mums -- this is the best of Montreal. The line is long, the hipsters are plentiful, the owners are Italian and the options are pure. 

Strong, smooth and a perfect crema - this is real coffee. It's what we all wait for."}
{"text":"Un incontournable dans le quartier. J'adore le café Olimpico. Une ambiance unique y règne."}
{"text":"I don't know if I'll ever say that a cappuccino blew me away but this is probably as good as it'll ever get. The detail down to the sugar, frothed milk, and topping were all just perfect. The cannolis were pretty good too, but not on the same level"}
{"text":"Olimpico \"Open Da Night\" - the legend is the sign read \"Open Day & Night\", the Y and the ampersand fell off and they did not bother to replace the sign! Poor business maintenance or GENIUS marketing ploy you ask?

On a sunny warm day, heck on a sunny day, season dont matter, this place will be packed on weekends between sunrise and sundown! Grabbing an outdoor patio spot is KEY for its precious real estate. 

I only get the latte's here ( one sugar), not because I not open to trying new things. On the contrary, when you have found something so awesome and perfect, why...pourquoi mess with perfection?

Arcade Fire hangs out here blah blah blah whoopity doo. Never ran into them here, couldnt care less, the quality of the coffee speaks for itself!"}
{"text":"Mind-blowing Coffee served in a  traditional way!!!
True coffee lovers... this Italian cafe is for you!
The most expensive coffee is 5 $ The little dessert servings are awesome.Coffee is flavorful, with no bitterness or aftertaste. It open will 11:00 and 12:00 AM at times, the best place to chat time over coffee.

When in the vicinity I take an early dinner @Green Panther, then roam around , go to a local pub, then buy the real Montreal bagel from St-Viateur Bagel Shop to go, eat it at Cafe Olimpico, and have a sip of authentic Italian coffee with the bagel. It's a tradition here! I like to have my coffee at Cafe Olimpico and that's undisputed. They serve all types of coffee and some desserts like biscotti and cakes. Anything you have here is just great. So perfect! 
In summers I have their Coffee Crema, it is a coffee and sugar churned till it becomes creamy, served in a small glass. Don't get fooled by the smaller looking quantity, you won't be able to finish it and forget the sleep that night, it's all caffeine you are taking in :) Also the affogato, hmmm wonderful.  In winters I take Tiramisu and Cappuccino or Macchiato, simply the best! I do bring their coffee beans home for my morning coffee... 
My love for coffee is well preserved by these awesome cafes."}
{"text":"A pretty cozy café with an extremely, according to my friend, cute barista. ;p 
We came in the afternoon around 5pm and there weren't that much pastries, at least not as much as I've seen on the pictures posted by other yelpers which was a total bummer. I had a cafe latte served on glass which I really liked, makes me feel like I'm just sipping coffee at home, a slice of carrot cake which was too dry for my liking and a tiramisu for my sister in a nice takeaway container: she said it was alright. 
Personally, I came for the coffee because I'm constantly looking for places to hang and read novels while sipping a warm cup of coffee, however I believe this will not be the place I'd go. Don't get me wrong, the ambience was great, noise level as super low...but, the coffee tastes pretty average, nothing too memorable and they only take cash. Sadly."}
{"text":"Best coffee ever! it's creamy and flavorful. I had the hot latte and my bf had the cold one. The cold one tasted better. This place was like a coffee sports bar which was a bit weird. But again, definitely worth the trip. Forget starbucks"}
{"text":"Stopped by Cafe Olimpico with my bagels from Fairmount Bagel and St. Viateur Bagels and ordered a latte. 

It was crowded but the latte was delicious. Definitely no frills and it reminds me of a sports bar sans liquor."}
{"text":"love that place really good coffee just a classic in the that hood.... love having my coffee and walk around the area"}
{"text":"Quick service and good espresso - doesn't have a great food selection, but thats not what they're trying to do. It has a unique feel, but doesn't quite do it for me in terms of comfort. A few couches, more comfortable chairs and tables on the patio would be welcome. But all in all a great place that fits its neighborhood. A macchiato on the patio on a sunny day and a good conversation - who could ask for more?"}
{"text":"great local coffee shop. drinks and beverages are very good and the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"It's easy to see why this is such a popular spot in the Mile End neighborhood...  it's just so damn comfortable. It's not fancy, not pricy and not pretentious. It's simply a good place to come, get a coffee, relax and people watch. The coffee was delicious and the prices are reasonable. Definitely a great experience and one I hope to repeat."}
{"text":"Lovely place with great mocha served in a glass glass :p, the desserts are lovely, the cannoli are stuffed with some really good cream

The terasse is cute and can sit there for hours

You must be wondering why 3 stars ? Rude staff and cash only ! 2 factors that mean allot ! I can let go if you are nice and take cash only , but when you lack both i feel disappointed"}
{"text":"Another great coffee place in Montreal. I tried both a macchiato and a latte, and would go back for more at the drop of a hat. 

The place was loud, but not in a bad way. It's just not the kind of place you'd go if you want to have some \"alone time\", or a quite D&M (Deep & Meaningful) with a friend - it doesn't even try to be that kind of place, and I like that.

If you want to have a get together with a big bunch of friends, watch some football (European-style, not your strange North American-style!), and have a great coffee, then go to Olimpico

I didn't see much in the way of food, just small things which go well with coffee - again, this place doesn't try to be anything other than a great coffee spot.

There was a wifi network, but I didn't use it, so don't know how good it is."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday afternoon. There was a long line. around 13 people lining through the cafe. According to my friend they make the best coffee on plateau. I am no expertise of coffee.I'd say I enjoyed my coffee. I had a dessert cannoli. It was worthy trying, can be better if with more nuts inside.

This is a sports cafe so you can watch games on the big screen. You can also find a tiny garden outside where you can sit but bench only no table. 

The deco is interesting and new to me. Overall this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"This was right across from our Air B and B, yay!

Great Italian inspired coffee, great entertainment from the staff, and an overall good time!  Local coffee shops in fun neighborhoods are dear to my heart."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good, Italian style coffee. Worth going out of your way for, also a cute garden outside!"}
{"text":"This place is strange - it's a sort of sports bar cafe, and most of the people here are locals and everyone seems to know each other, which is really nice. Might not be the kind of cafe experience you're expecting, though!

The drinks were good and the Italian pastries were VERY good."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and the service is great! I ordered a cappuccino. Would definitely come again"}
{"text":"I don't generally even drink coffee. Just every once in while. But I've seen Cafe Olimpico frequently touted as the best coffee shop in Montreal on several lists so I decided to give them a try.

I got the Americano which is basically black coffee. I wanted to experience the best coffee grounds Montreal had to offer. I was not disappointed. This was the best coffee I've ever had. The brew was rich and deeply dark brown. The aroma was intense. The drink went down smooth. This was everything I've ever wanted in a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"I forgot that Montreal is like Europe and serves authentic espresso drinks - so my macchiato was in an espresso size cup and not an American Starbucks size one. I should've ordered the cappuccino instead especially since that is what they are known for! doh. 

I arrived on a Saturday morning expecting a long line, but it was very reasonable (the long line did show up though). One barista had a very loud personality, so he may rub you the wrong way, but I found him funny and unique to this cafe- felt more like I was at a friendly neighborhood bar. Bonus of Olimpico is its proximity to Saint Viateur bagels, so you can get a nice morning in this 'hood (although you can also partake in the delicious doughnuts they sell here, which we couldn't help but do)."}
{"text":"Fantastic iced espresso. I ordered it in the local language: Cold one, for here. 

You're on an edgy plane here. The patrons are tres cool. 

And here's some insider's knowledge: It's a sports bar."}
{"text":"Very good coffee and ok desserts! They offer affordable tiramisu and a whole range of biscotti."}
{"text":"Great coffee! It is a hipster place and can be very fun to meet someone at. I went with my aunts and Mom. We all enjoyed the coffee and had some good laughs."}
{"text":"This place pulls a nice, strong espresso.  It was crowded when I was there, so I assume it's popular with the locals.  I had a double, on top of two coffees I had consumed elsewhere, and then drove away with an elevated heartbeat."}
{"text":"Si tu veux voir un match de hockey ou de foot sans une bière alternatif est un espresso. Olympico est la place super ambiance de fan. Les espresso sont délicieux.. Un des cafe italien les plus réputée à mtl  7.5/10"}
{"text":"Un café classique du Mile-End, bon latté abordable servi dans un verre. L'été vous avez une terrasse sur le côté. Sympa !"}
{"text":"The coffee bar formerly known as Open Da Night (although you can still find die-hards around that continue to call it by that name, or variations upon it, like \"Open D\"), has lost some of its former ramshackle charm to renovations (they survived a devastating fire), and their prices have crept up steadily over the years (their lattes were still just $1.50 a few years ago), but they still make one of the most satisfying old-school lattes in town and the ambiance can be pure theater at times (actually, pretty much all the time).

One of the quintessential Mile End hangouts, and one of the most animated places in Montreal to watch World Cup and European Cup soccer action."}
{"text":"The coffee is great. They have seats inside and outside. It is nice to sit outside and enjoy their coffee on a sunny day. The price is very reasonable. $3 for a cappuccino and 2.25 for a macchiato are unbeatable. This place deserves a 5 stars rating given the quality of the coffee, the price, and the at mosphere. It's near the famous Kem Coba, Fairmont Bagel, and St. Viateur bagels so you should definitely check this out on your way to explore the food spots in Montreal."}
{"text":"This is simply the best espresso and latte place in Montreal. Amazing place to watch sports like hockey and soccer games. The only times I had better coffee was when I was in Rome (totally serious)"}
{"text":"Interesting place, but not my style. I'm a fan of small, cute cafes that feel like a cross between a library, a wine cellar, and your favorite aunt's sitting room. This place felt like a bar in Rome that somehow got a reputation for its coffee. 

I showed up at 9am on a Wednesday, and was surprised by the long line of customers waiting for coffee. The whole time I was there, the line was at least 10 people deep, although there seemed to be no shortage of seating, inside and out. Waiting in the slow-moving line, I was very close to leaving without ordering anything, despite having biked 20 minutes specifically to check this place out (based on Yelp reviews). The interior was sort of dingy, covered in old posters, with TVs on the walls. It was unpleasantly noisy, too - too loud to hold a conversation, although it turned out that the din of the radio, the baristas, and the motorcycles on the street was strangely hypnotic and conducive to working. With the windows wide open I was able to take in the scenery of Mile End, with a side order of smog and cigarette smoke (maybe I'm oversensitive on that point - I'm really not used to the poor air quality in Montreal yet).

Olimpico did remind me of small backstreet cafés in Italy, and felt \"authentic\" in that way. One barista had a kickass moustache, for which I give props. I can't remember the pet name the other barista called me. \"Doll\"? \"Sweetie\"? Yuck. It was very authentically patronizing - props deducted.

My latte was tasty, as was the almond biscotti. There was a great selection of biscotti and other treats, which I'll try if I come back. But I'm not sure I will."}
{"text":"Best cafe in Montreal! Extremely popular but worth the wait. Cafe Frededo latte is tasty( I don't like very sweet, and this coffee is just bittersweet)  and the decor is very cozy"}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place, but it was always packed so I never stopped for a coffee. My parents in-law were in town and rented (Air BnB) a place just next to it and they immediately fell in love with it (visiting it twice a day or more). I joined them one morning for a coffee and understood right a way they fell in love with it. Stepping inside this place is like stepping inside Italy, the vibe, the language..everything. I can honestly say this is one of the best coffee I had in Montreal and the cannoli you can get during the weekend is just
 W-O-W
The only thing I didnt like is the fact that this is a cash only place"}
{"text":"My favourite place for a cappucino in Montreal. Great cannoli too, but only on the weekend. They sell out at around 4:30, so don't delay! Nice patio too. Oh and grab a biscotti if the cannoli is sold out."}
{"text":"Je n'en reviens pas que personne ai écrit à propos de Café Olimpico en français! Je sais, je sais. Le café est dans un coin un peu plus anglophone de la ville, mais c'est quand même une institution du Mile End qui aide d'innombrables caféïnomanes à survivre!

La file a beau avoir l'air d'être très longue mais ça vaut la peine car elle passe très rapidement. Ils sont des experts en espresso donc ils sont facilement capables de préparer les boissons pour 5 à 6 personnes à la fois. C'est un café qui dégage tellement d'énergie, que simplement d'y entrer vous donnera un \"boost\" pour bien débuter votre journée.

Les cafés sont bons, les prix bas et même facile à mémoriser (2.50$ pour un latte). Pour faire avancer les choses encore plus facilement, je recommande d'emmener la monnaie exacte."}
{"text":"Hipsterville, great espresso, 7 types of biscotti, noisy.  Trendy neighborhood."}
{"text":"What a great local coffee shop in Montreal. In a city located with tons of coffee shops and bakeries, Cafe Olimpico stands on top of my list. 

Drinks:
- cappuccino made from fresh beans was really good
- cafe au let was delicious

Likes:
- it's nice to see people hanging out watching the football games sober : )
- great place to hang out, drinking coffee and watching the games
- good assortment of hot beverages
- 4 to 5 TV's with a large drop down projector
- barista staff is entertaining and friendly
- staple coffee shop in Montreal
- free wifi
- outdoor seating

Dislikes:
- a bit hot inside
- line to get a drink can get long especially on a Sunday afternoon 

I would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Café Olimpico (@cafeolimpico) was opened back in 1970 and I'm sure there's a reason why it remain so popular. This was another recommendation from friends as the best coffee in Montreal and it was only a few steps away from our lunch spot here, so just had to drop by.

As per their website :
Café Olimpico's strong heritage and authenticity is mirrored by it's house-blend coffee that has remained a family's secret recipe for nearly half a century. Our coffee offers a selected balance of Arabica coffee beans from Central and South America, roasted to perfection and brought together to give you an irresistibly smooth and sweet taste. Its fine aromas and intense flavours will be sure to tantalize your taste buds.

As I step inside I was totally taken aback form the huge line up but fortunately, it does move fairly quickly. With the huge tv, it's perfect to hang out if you want to catch a game or hang out in their fairly large patio on warmer days. Plus they open until Midnight 7 days a week.

No fancy flashy coffee machine here, just the old sturdy block.

Cappuccino
~ We each got a cappuccino and this is was a fairly \"old-school\" foamy version without the cute latte art. I found the foam/milk to airy for me which resulted in a not as smooth creation as I prefer while the coffee/espresso itself was slightly aromatic, I would prefer a darker roast.
~ On a side note, I also noticed that all coffee places in Montreal will ask if you want sugar in your espresso drink while none will ask here in Toronto and most other places I visited (maybe Montrealer like sweet coffees)

Verdict:
~ I would say it's not my cut of coffee but I'm still glad I tried.
~ But would love to come back just for the atmosphere and since we didn't get a chance to sit down this time."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! After stuffing my face full of Wilensky Specials down the road, I was in need of some rest and relaxation. It was unseasonably warm out, so the outdoor patio was perfect and the WiFi allowed me to check some emails on the go. They only take cash, but luckily I had enough on hand my for my friend and I to squeeze out a couple espresso drinks along with a modest tip. The tip was well deserved as the baristas are obviously getting high on their own caffeine supply. One of them was even singing along to DMX \"Where my dogs at?\" as though he himself was an aspiring Rough Rider. This prompted the waiting customers and other employees to respond with a resounding \"Right here dog!\". 

DMX, Italian machismo, delicious espresso... what more could you ask for? Ride or Die bitches!"}
{"text":"Love this cafe  great coffee + cool vibe. New favorite spot in Montreal. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Worth a visit. Great espresso. Yummy treats & nice service. Good neighborhood. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Petit coup de coeur juste visuel sur ce café du Mile End. C'est la première fois que j'écris sur un lieu que je n'ai pas testé, mais celui-ci m'a tapé dans l'oeil rien que par son charme.

On passait devant, et j'ai ralenti quelques secondes car j'ai trop aimé l'ambiance qui s'en dégageait : les gens à la cool qui profitaient du salle sur la belle terrasse, le calme des rues, la jolie déco avec son côté un peu \"resté dans son jus\".

On avait rdv donc on ne s'est pas arrêté, et je m'étais promis d'y repasser, mais pas eu l'occasion. Dommage, ce sera pour la prochaine fois.

Aucune crainte d'être déçue, les avis résument bien ce que j'ai ressenti seulement en passant devant, alors une fois dedans !"}
{"text":"Warmy place, fast service, many tables , terrasse, smeel good, sometimes very very busy."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped in this Italian cafe for a morning coffee and the experience was made by the number of Italians gathered to watch the Italy/Uruguay World Cup 2014 game.

The atmosphere was great and there's a lot of prime seating and free WIFI. The coffee is Italian style so the iced latte was a bit small but already had the perfect amount of sugar in it!"}
{"text":"The guy behind the counter is annoying and loud with his completely over-done italuan theatrics.  Must be the owner because If he's an employee I would have fired him a long time ago if he worked for me.  Espresso was very good, Italian style.  However a bit disappointing that they have no raw sugar.  When I asked I was rudely told \"it turns brown when it goes in.\"   I'll not return."}
{"text":"This cafe must be one node of a large system that is Montreal's rich mob culture. With Olimpico, this is only an intuition arrived at by the gruff employees, I don't give a heck attitude and that it's cash only. However, the mob presence in Montreal is more or less undeniable. 

If you want to get a sense of this presence I recommend taking a trip to Chinatown's New Dynasty restaurant at 2am for some late night eats. After you get past the bouncer you'll likely see that amongst all the young, belligerent late night costumers there are tables of bald men in suits, silently eating their meals. There is even a YouTube video of a violent fight on the dining room floor between two rival mob members. Chairs are thrown all over the place! Ferocious stuff. In the back of new dynasty there is this big secret room with a long table! 

Also there is this bakery on St. Laurant where you can't have your cell phones out and sometimes the sweet mob-affiliated lady who runs the place thinks your microchipped.

I've thought about the mob a lot. I support them. Human nature involves the shadow; greed, lust, power. It is better to give this part of ourselves a sort of penned-off playground to run around in than deny our dark side altogether so it can fester and harm others in chaotic and uncontrolled ways. If the criminal is within you and unready to be purged, it is better allow it to express itself in a relatively controlled manner. Otherwise we isolate and condemn the criminal in each of us and begin cultivating shame and resentment. Shame and resentment are the real danger, not chaos in its selfish and greedy form. As I see it shame and resentment bring the true horrors of the world. Mob members seem dignified. Becoming a non-contradictory and integrated individual who allows for every aspect of yourself and remains virtuous and dignified is challenging, but it's possible through acceptance! And for the few of us who are more shadow than light, mob-type organizations are perfect. Eventually we will grow tired of our most selfish qualities as we see that they don't bring us any lasting happiness and begin the path of self-correction. As far as I can tell this is a natural process, not one that involves self-denial. So yeah, I'm pro-mob for sure."}
{"text":"Great coffee. 

Real authentic Italian coffee house, the service is full on - had 22 people in line in front of me and I was out of there in 7min. WOW!

The kind of place I will head to watch the Eurocup, if Italy is in the final!

 Nothing very sophisticated but a real classic."}
{"text":"Ooppsy! colour me embarrassed, it seems that the cafe I meant to yelp is actually called the social club and is one block over but looks the same.
I guess I never knew the name and assumed that the one that showed up here under Social club st viateur was the only one but..,  it' s not the same.

I have tried both and the main difference is that the Olimpico, is mostly just coffee and they don't have those scrumptious sandwiches, I will be heading up there tomorrow and should be able to sort it all out.....to be contiued da da da"}
