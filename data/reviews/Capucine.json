{"text":"Un petit café avec des prix doux et des plats pour emporter d'excellentes qualités. Le café latte est bon ainsi que les viennoiseries. On y retourne pour essayer les smoothies maison."}
{"text":"Nice place for a quick snack, a little drink or some coffee. They also fresh squeeze juices. There is a nice selection of tasty little bites, like sandwiches, Viennese pastry, fresh salads, and just amazingly large selection for such a little place. Prices are very reasonable. Service is very friendly. There is a lot to like about this little place."}
{"text":"What a cool find! We stayed across the street and came here in the afternoon for a much needed Americano and a snack for my daughter. The staff was very accommodating they even warmed upa pre packaged pasta and were very patient. The even took care not to heat it up in the plastic container!   I wish we had the appetite to try one of their lovely desserts. Next time for sure."}
