{"text":"A little piece of Bretagne, France on Queen Street West. I absolutely love the buckwheat flour crepes here as well as the dessert ones. It's a great atmosphere + great prices. They serve all the typical French beverages as well like kir, cider... I like it a lot.  Can't wait to come back here with a bunch of ladies.  One word of advice: you will leave the place smelling like crepes; a bad thing for some, a good thing for others."}
{"text":"Great place, and delicious food. This cozy restaurant is a little taste of Paris in TO. i highly recommend this place to Paris lovers."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were walking down Queen West last Saturday and stumbled upon this place. Initially we walked in with an intention to rest for few minutes while having a drink and perhaps a little snack. We were seated at a back yard patio that was secluded, cozy and shaded by greenery, which immediately put us into relaxed yet uplifted mood. We ordered a kir breton and prosciutto garlic-potato crepes.   We thought we were not really hungry, but after sharing this delicately crafted, adventurously delicious crepe we couldn't help but want more and ordered a sweet kind - pear strawberry with hot chocolate sauce. That was a real treat - crepe was so light it melted in your mouth, fruit was ripe and tasty, and chocolate was moderately dark and genuine. It was so good that after finishing the serving and overcoming a moment of guilt-laden hesitation we ordered a repeat performance, which went without a hitch.   On top of wonderful food add great friendly service, cozy space and moderate prices and you have yourself a perfect haven for brunch, dinner or chill-out snack."}
{"text":"Best creperie ever! You feel right in France and at home. Crepes are fresh and sauces are homemade. Highly recommend this place! :)"}
{"text":"This place makes you feel as if you've literally stepped into North Eastern creperie in France!   There are a few creperies that I have currently been to in Toronto- however, La Brehandaise Creperie is the only one I've dined in that holds true to French dining. Yes, this includes waiting obscene amounts of time for food that really doesn't look like it would take 40 minutes to make... BUT. This is the norm in Europe, so take a breath and bring someone you like, because you are bound to conversation (or your coffee) for quite some time before you have food to stall with.   The decor is sweet. As in the country home pale blues and yellows with wooden wobbly tables and floral curtains sweet (this is the first hint to Frenchie-ness; if they are good for anything, it is their homage to 'French living' magazines that don such interior designs).   The server we had was very friendly, and he was only to happy to give you a detailed history of the creperie and how it came to be.   My mother and I were just in for an afternoon snack, so we were unable to gorge ourselves like we might've liked to. BUT, what we did have was DELISH.   The salad we started with was very, very simple: Romaine leaves with white-wine vingerette. However, they top it off with two halves of toast smeared with goatcheese and honey. MM. SO good.  Perfect appetizer!  Afterwards we shard a carmelized apple and vanilla icecream dessert crepe. Oh my Lord, was this spectactular! What I most enjoyed about it, was that you didn't clear your plate feeling like you had sinned. You actually felt lighter! It was so fresh and full of flavor that you kind of need to order two of them to fully get the effect they are meant to give.   As far as I'm aware, the prices were right (my mother paid the bill), but I would definitely return even if the prices had been steep. This place serves food seen in gourmet restaurants!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
