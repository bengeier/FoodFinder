{"text":"I absolutely love this spa and had such a great experience there. The staff was so delightful from the second I walked inside to the second I left. Not only does this spa deliver on the spa experience it delivered on a great massage too.
I started my day at the spa going with two of my good friends. We came around lunch time and went to the little cafe they have and had some small plates of food and salads. All of which were so delicious. Then we went back to the locker room where they had robes and slippers waiting for us to change in and personalized lockers where you can set a personalized code to keep your things safe. What I love about this place is its not like the local massage places where they do memberships. Those you don't get the spa experience were you leave absolutely blissed and relaxed. After putting on the robes and slippers we went into a waiting room that was so peaceful and beautiful. They had nuts and every kind of tea you could think of for you as you waited. Next your person massage therapist comes out and brings you back to your private room. The massage itself was absolutely fabulous. After it was done I felt so relax all I wanted to do was spend everyday of my life at this spa and let them empty my bank account to do so. Really I could for the rest of my life live at this spa. But the beauty doesn't end there of this spa experience. They have jacuzzis, steam rooms, and dry saunas for you to utilize. Getting any of their treatments you get a pass for their spa for the whole day so if you choose to come early to utilize these you can, or if you wanna utilize it after they welcome both. I almost forgot that they have a outdoor pool and lounge chairs so I also got a tan poolside with piña colada's from the bar inside. This spa provided a perfect day for me and my friends and I would recommend it to anybody and everybody if they were looking for one to go to.  

Also I was able to come and enjoy this spa because I found a package for a 50 minute massage or facial for only $99 dollars. Which is the one I got. They also have one for a 50 minute massage and a 50 minute facial for $189. Since I loved my experience so much I think I'm going to spend the money for both next time!"}
{"text":"Love the peaceful setting and relaxing around the pool after a treatment. Rarely had a problem."}
{"text":"Nice ambience, good massage but too pricey! I've been to nicer place than this for a better price too!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best spa I have ever been to - and I have been to MANY. You walk in and feel instantly relaxed. I got the hot stone massage, and loved that it incorporated some of the Native American culture. Afterward I enjoyed the spa facilities - steam room, whirlpool and outdoor pool. All were spectacular.  The locker room was incredibly well appointed, and I was very impressed that the shower rooms each had shaving cream, a razor, a shower cap and clean towels inside. 

If I am ever in the area again, I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My 2 sisters and I took a girls trip to Phoenix and wanted to have a spa day.  I decided to splurge and sign the 3 of us up for the Gila River Rock Massage at Aji.  Extremely pricey, but the massage was wonderful and we were allowed axcess to the full spa area- hot tub, pool, outdoor seating, steam room- so we felt it was worth it.  (Our appointments were at 1:30pm, we arrived by noon and stayed until 5:30pm.)  If you plan to spend most of the day at Aji the price of the service is worth it.  Jason was my massage therapist and he was FANTASTIC.  The chef was also wonderful, he stayed a few minutes passed his shift to accomodate us.  All and all, the spa was beautiful and the service was perfect so this spa gets five stars from me!  Thank you Aji!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few spas across the spectrum of spas, cheap to expensive, and this one tops the lot. The staff there are very nice and accommodating. They make you feel very welcome there. My husband and I went for our anniversary.We both had a very thorough and amazing massage. Making use of the jacuzzi area before and after was a real treat. I indulged in the 'go nude' option there and it was very nice. I only saw a couple of other customers while I was there and then only briefly. I loved the lemonade with agave nectar and cucumber water. Very refreshing after a soak in the whirlpool. I only wish I was wealthy so I could afford to do this regularly!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing place . The staff are very friendly and the facilities are very nice and clean. The massages here are great and although expensive  they are definitely worth the money. The food here is also great and the overall environment is very relaxing.  It is the best spa I have ever been to."}
{"text":"A friend of mine goes every year for her birthday. A Groupon deal made me take the plunge.

I could write a book about how peaceful and amazing my day was. Even now, I hesitate because I don't want to pack the place. Every staff member we encountered was warm, friendly, and very helpful. Unlike other upscale spas, I never felt out of place.

My masseuse was Johnny- he was fantastic. The beverages and snacks while waiting? Delicious. Steam room, sauna, jaccuzzis inside and outdoors, pool. The chef created delicious dishes from the rotating menu. The mixologist crafted some delicious (and strong) drinks. Corinna checked us out and gave info on the locals' specials.

While the prices might seem steep, they're well worth the experience. I will be returning."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful spa afternoon thanks to my husband, Groupon and Aji spa during a visit to AZ last fall.  The massage was perfect, the spa facilities are very clean and nice and the staff is professional yet friendly.  Special thanks to Alina who went above and beyond in helping me feel safe and comfortable when my husband was late picking me up.  Also thanks for the yummy snacks in the waiting room.  I will definitely return as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"The Aji Spa, at the Shereton Wild Horse Pass, has a wonderful setting going for it.  The Spa itself is relaxing and not stuffy.   This Spa can be pricey -- even in the realm of resort Spas - but it doesn't have to be.  Check their Internet specials.  I just took advantage of their Recession Spa package - 25 minute facial, 25 minute massage, 25 minute manacure, 25 minute pedicure , plus lunch is included- all for a weekday price of $199 (weekend prices are $250 for the package)."}
{"text":"This spa is amazing!  I've been several times and it never disappoints.  The view is incredible, the locker rooms are clean, spacious and equipped with everything you could possibly need, the showers are awesome, customer service is great, and I could go on.  I've had massages and a facial which were all awesome.  However, the massages have been hands down the best I've had.  I love that you're able to hang out for the afternoon and just enjoy the spa.  It IS expensive, but I've purchased some vouchers or have (luckily) been treated, which made it a lot more affordable!  Either way - I highly recommend it..."}
{"text":"Wonderful spa service. Never have I been so relaxed and enjoyed a massage as much. Great atmosphere and the service incredible. Can't say enough about lent experience. Thank you."}
{"text":"This is a true day spa. You won't want to leave. It's not just the services which are incredible! They offer horseback riding to see the wild horses and a massage afterwards! It's the energy, amenities, location and great service that make this place so special. 
Plan to spend the day. Enjoy all this place has to offer.
Don't pass up the services. They're incredible but make time to enjoy the pool, spas, sauna, steam room at your leisure
My coworkers and I went as a gift of appreciation and left rejuvenated. This place embodies the word.
I had the Prickly Pear Massage in the AM and the Infusion Facial in the afternoon. Both hands down the best I've experienced. The afternoon was spent by the pool and in between lunch and the steam room releasing toxins. Amazing.
I'll definitely be back! In fact, trying to find something with a similar experience in San Diego to take my mom but after looking I'm thinking I'll be better off flying her here if I want her to feel all they have to offer.
This place rivals Sonnenalp in Vail, CO. So grateful it's close."}
{"text":"I had a very relaxing time at the Aji Spa. Normally resort spas are a little too expensive for me, but I got a special off TravelZoo for a massage and champagne lunch.
 
When you arrive and check in, the spa locker room attendant escorts you to the locker room and shows you where everything is, they assign you a locker and provide you with a nice cozy robe and slippers. The locker room is really nice and has everything you need (towels, soap, shampoo, conditioner, razors, shaving cream, hairdryer, lotion, etc.) which was good since all I brought with me was my swim suit. The showers are nice and spacious. The locker room attendants are great, there are always towels available and they even have ice cold towels to put on your head when you use the jacuzzi.

My massage was very good. Much better than the usual ones that I get at my local massage envy. If they have more specials, I would like to go back and try a spa facial or one of their other treatments. The lunch included was from the Cafe at the spa and I had the flat bread pizza which was really yummy. 

I think the nice thing about the Aji Spa is that you can stay and use the spa amenities. They have a sauna, a steam room, jacuzzis, and an outdoor swimming pool. The spa is separated from the resort/hotel part so there are no kids at the spa pool so it's quiet. We were lucky it was a beautiful warm day out so it was perfect for laying out by the pool. I think we spent about 4 hours at the spa just relaxing."}
{"text":"I was surprised by this gift from my coworkers who knew I needed R&R. Right from the moment I walked in. I was greeted with kindness. The facility was clean and well maintained. I had a massage and foot rub. Spent some time in the jacuzzi and had a relaxing waterfall shower. Everything you need is provided. I had a great time and would happily make this drive from CA just to visit again."}
{"text":"I had the chance to return to Aji Spa in August for another great spa experience.  Upon leaving the I-10, gliding on a one-lane bridge, venturing over a man-made creek and winding along the desert setting, the Spa appears on the right.  You'll then park your car within view of the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Hotel & Casino and enter the
high-ceiling foyer of the Aji Spa.

Monica greeted me each time and was perfectly polite (even though I was 5-10 minutes late the 2nd time.)  I was escorted back to the locker room and instructed to change into a robe, shower and informed that the service provider would great me in the tea lounge.  This is adjacent to the locker rooms and is set up like a small studio.  Complete with a fireplace, doors to the terrace/ patio, a tea area and multiple seating choices. 

I strolled over and fixed myself a hot green tea and took a small dish of trail mix.  As soon as I finished, the massage therapist appeared.  Don't recall her name though.   The next time that I visit, the scheduler can probably find her name in the system for booking ease.

Glad that they escort you here, would have definitely been lost tying to navigate the long hallways and corners.  The massage service was excellent, great flow and techniques.  She was talented and loved her craft, it showed.

I also like the rooms.  They aren't too small or too big, just the right size space for a massage.  Also, it was great that I was able to go on a weekday morning, Satursdays & Sundays are probably a lot busier in the hallways & locker rooms.

Following the blissful massage, I opted for the cold plunge, jacuzzi and then sauna for an invigorating jolt.  The cold plunge is COLD and well worth the experience.  ( You have been warned.)

I will definitely return again soon to this oasis, just off of the 10...."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT TRIP TO THE SPA!!!!! 

A trip to the Aji Spa (located at the Sheraton Wildhorse Pass Resort and Spa) was at the top of my list during my recent trip to Arizona on Memorial Day Weekend. We made our reservations well in advance. Having gone to a few spa resorts, I couldn't wait to pay this one a visit. 

My cousin and I were each booked for the Little Yellow Bird spa package, which was comprised of 2 services each. We arrived about 15 minutes prior to our appointment time and was given a tour of the spa. After changing in the women's locker room, and relaxing in the private women's lounge area (there's a large lounge area, but it's co-ed), our masseuses met us and brought us into our room. My cousin and I decided for our first service to be the Companion Massage. After only having solo massages, I was interested how a companion massage differed. The 50 minute Aji Massage flew by. My masseuse was professional and the massage given was very comfortable, relaxing and beneficial. 

After our massages were completed, we had some time in between our next service, feeling a little hungry, we decided to grab some lunch from the spa's cafe. I ordered the flatbread pizza and it was TO DIE FOR! Seeded flatbread topped off with a garlic peppery aioli, grilled chicken pieces, pesto sauce, marinated bell peppers, melted cheese and avocado. My visit was a month and a half ago and my memory, a little fuzzy, but that was one of the best lunches I've had in a long time!! 

After lunch sometime, we each were up for our second service, our facials!!! Due to my skin type, I received the Aji Rain Facial. My esthetician was wonderful! Her hands were soft and gentle while working on my face and we had some lovely conversation during the 50 minute procedure. I left that room with my face feeling renewed, clean and fresh!

All spa treatments include full use of the spa's facilities so we definitely made well use of that! After our facials, we used the sauna (the steam room was out of service during our visit) and whirlpools located on the women's locker side. We then relaxed and lounged by the outside pool. The Aji Spa is such a calm, warm and relaxing environment that I ended up taking a nap! Outside! In desert heat! Thank goodness for the wooden awning with misters attached and the huge patio umbrellas providing shade! The staff at the spa provided excellent service! From the front desk, to our masseuse, the esthetician, the cafe staff and the locker room attendant! While napping, one of the staff from the cafe even brought us iced water with lemon and cucumber slices in it!

Our appointment started at 12pm and with our 2 procedures, and lunch, we should have been done and out of there within a few hours. But the point of visiting the spa was to relax, and with Aji Spa being such a lovely place, we just didn't want to leave!  We finally left nearly 8 hours after our arrival, and we would have stayed longer if we could! 

I highly recommend Aji Spa to anyone visiting the Phoenix area, or if you're looking for a new spa to travel to! Aji Spa is a beautiful spa with excellent staff and service. They even emailed me the same day of my service as a \"Thank You\" for visiting and included a discount coupon on my next visit! A 5-star spa, indeed!"}
{"text":"I went to Aji Spa for a pre-wedding consultation. The consultation included a bridal hair style and bridal make up. I started with my hair style. I showed a picture of what I wanted and the stylist said she could deliver. The finished product was nothing like the photo I showed. I did not look or feel like a bride AT ALL. While the stylist was nice, she proceeded to tell me how she went out the night before to an event with an open bar. It wasn't the most professional but I guess I wouldn't have minded had my hair turned out how I wanted. 

My makeup artist was very nice and has been there for many years. I loved the way my skin looked however my eyes and lips turned out nothing like my inspiration picture. I showed a picture with gold/nude tones and said I typically wear those colors and walked away with purple eyeshadow. The eyeliner was heavy on the upper and lower lids which is also very different from my usual makeup routine and idea of my wedding day makeup. 

I gave it all a chance and went home to see my fiancé's reaction. He said the hair was really bad, not classy or elegant at all. He said I didn't even look like myself with the way my makeup was done. Needless to say I took my hair down and makeup off immediately. 

My fiancé was so upset and noticed that I was clearly upset that he called them. I'm not sure what the conversation consisted of with the director of the spa (yes, director) but he did say they attempted to put it back on me at first. After some back and forth he was told I'd receive a full refund. I haven't checked to see if the refund has been given as it has been less than 48 hours. So we'll see how that goes.

I won't be going there again for any services. Thank goodness for a trial appointment or else my wedding day would have been absolutely ruined."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful day here with my momma pre-baby... planning a birthday visit for my birthday (post-baby) I can't wait for some relaxing girl time(baby free)!"}
{"text":"The ultimate spa experience! Expect to be pampered! Plan to spend the day and relax by the poolside!"}
{"text":"Pros:
- Calm/Quiet atmosphere
- Clean
- Amenities are good *Hot tub outdoors and inside, large steam room & sauna.  Nice sitting areas both outside and inside. 
- Products (Shampoo, conditioner & body wash were okay.)

Cons:
- EXPENSIVE!
- Beware of the 20%gratuity (i don't know who's idea this was but, i was a little offended at the presumptive 20% tip. I tip well when deserved but i like tipping on my own terms.) 
- Spa hostess at the front desk/checking in was snooty
- 50 min massages

I went in for Aji (swedish) 50 min massage, the massage therapist was personable and was attentive to what I asked her to focus on. I know the time limit was not her fault but 50 mins for a massage at these prices made me feel really ripped off.  (i had a Groupon to offset the ridiculous cost but even that didn't make me feel better about the cost.) I don't know who thinks a 50 min massage is enough.......but come on an extra 10 mins wouldn't kill them!

All in all i would say skip it, it's expensive and for less money you can get a 60 min or 90 min and feel great because you didn't over pay."}
{"text":"Spent a wonderful day here!   This second time around was better than the first time. The  \"Aji Kolada\" was super with the fresh toasted coconut on top.  It was more like a slushy dessert than a drink!  The mini facial experience was relaxing and had all the essential treatments included.  With the use of their amenities available .... steam room , sauna, jacuzzi and pool we spent many hours here.  The radiccio salad was a gratifying lunch.....more so than the lettuce cups, which I ordered on my visit four months ago.  Great, efficient and  friendly service today!  I will be returning. (I had to edit this review to add photos.  :) )"}
{"text":"Most beautiful spa I've been to!  Loved every moment of it - except that the day went by too fast.  All the employees are so customer service oriented.  The place is beautiful.  Hope I get the chance to spend the day at Aji Spa again someday!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience!  The facility is so peaceful and serene!  Michael gave my massage and it was so relaxing. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is an extremely nice spa.  I had a facial and a mother to be massage while I was there and they were both fantastic.  The receptionist was very friendly and informative and both the facialist and masseuse I saw were friendly and professional.  The facility itself was beautiful and relaxing.  I do think they should consider a lighter weight robe for the summer months because walking around in a heavy thick robe when it is 107 degrees outside and not much cooler inside was quite unpleasant.  I was also surprised given the heat and the robes that I was offered hot tea.  I nearly laughed out loud as I could not think of anything that sounded worse at the time.  That being said to each their own.  If there is some wackadoo, nut job out there that wants to sit in 107 degree heat wearing a thermal robe drinking hot tea more power to them I suppose.  My only real complaint about this spa was the prices.  I have been to several other spas of this caliber and not one if them was this expensive.  On average it was at least 40-60 dollars more expensive per service.  Overall I would definitely return to this spa if I were ever in the area again.  Just one word of advice be sure they charge your spa services to the correct credit card.  I used my own card to book the spa services, and my husband used his company card to book our rooms in the resort and even though I told the girl checking me out that I did NOT want the services charged to the room somehow she did this anyway instead of to the card I used to book the services.  A simple mistake I'm sure and it was easily fixed once I found our what had happened.  I'm just glad my husband didn't have to try to explain why there were almost 300 dollars of spa charges on his company card!"}
{"text":"Lovely!  Plan to make a day of it and enjoy a relaxing day by the pool with a delicious lunch and refreshing drink.  We stayed from 11am-5pm with a travelzoo for a 50 minute massage, and 25 minute add on.  Workout room is beautiful, clean and like new.  Adult only pool is large enough to relax in privacy without being overrun- many of the visitors only stay and hour or two leaving the best for you to enjoy.  Private clothing optional jacuzzi and sunbathing deck for the risque.  Lots of top quality extras such as refreshments, and toiletries.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  We will be back!! 

Highly recommend for a girls day out!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely, relaxing spa that seems to promote a healing, restorative, restful experience. Had a wonderful massage and manicure and generally awesome experience using the pool, sauna, and steam room facilities that come included with any service. 

I can get just as good a manicure for $15 unfortunately, although great not worth the $65. Also, They use a local vegan nail polish line that dries in 5 minutes. The polish dries unevenly and starts cracking almost immediately."}
{"text":"So this is my first time at a spa. Ever. I don't really \"pamper\" myself, I guess you can say...Aji hits the spot!!

It took us a while to find this place, it was part of a hotel/casino/golfcourse/tennis course/vacation spot in the nowheres of Chandler. We took a few dangerous looking dirt 'paths' to find this place..we hoped this would be worth our troubles, and it was!

We make it to the front entrance of the hotel, and the spa was on the opposite side of where we were, so they volunteered to drive us there, very nicee! 

Incredibly soothing music and calming Southwest architecture make up the spa..our eyes instantly see the large swimming pool beyond the building as we walk in. Very clean locker rooms, jacuzzi, saunas, showers and lounging areas. We had our individual facials with our own ladies. My lady was Erin, she was so friendly and all the lotions, scrubs and peels she put on me smelled and felt wonderful! I loved the papaya-pineapple lotion, and her massaging hands that almost put me to sleep.

We were so refreshed and calm after our treatments, they offered berry iced teas and other refreshments. Too bad it cost $320 for two facials, I'd be here all the time if it didn't cost this much."}
{"text":"This is a very nice spa! It's not part of the main hotel but rather it's own separate building. I really enjoyed all the amenities this spa had to offer. The pool is large for a spa pool with tons of seating. Snack and refreshments were offered in the waiting room. The spa lunch menu and drinks were also really good. The staff was nice and it was a really relaxing day. I enjoyed my massage. The treatment rooms were nice. It was not loud or felt crowded, which I liked a lot. This spa was clean and not run down. Had a Arizona desert vibe. I will be back. Love."}
{"text":"Was underwhelming experience. Had a great time with my friends but won't be coming back. First my robe I was given was torn and replacement I was given was too small. Third robe given was adequate even though the attendant seemed frustrated she had to get me a robe that fit. The temperature within the spa was a bit warm and humid not just in the locker room but the entire spa even the lobby. The Meditation room was not comfortable. I had a 50 min massage which was just ok, not the best I've had. I really liked the scent of the massage oil so I decided to purchase it. Got home and opened it and found out what I purchased was un-scented. I called (waited 10min to speak to a human) and was told I could go back and exchange which I did. Nobody was in the store so I asked front desk for help told her what happened and she said she would get manager. Lady who showed up who was working store earlier said she was manager. She seemed to think I was nuts and kept insisting I thought I had sampled the prickly pear massage oil. I finally had to take the lid off the sample to show her what I had wanted to purchase was not what she was saying I wanted. She made a call and found out they were out of what I was looking for and offered for me to exchange for something else or return for full refund. I said I would return. Then when she came back I suggested not refunding me and just ship it to me when they get more. She declined and refunded my purchase. They said they would call me when they got more so I could get it at that time. To me too much bad service. The thing to make things right would have been to apologize for the inconvenience ship it to me waiving any shipping fees. Or do something for the trouble they put me thru and my time wasted! Something to show they appreciated my business and wanted to make it up to me. For how much they charge for services I'm definitely not coming back. I'd rather spend my spa money at a place that makes me feel like a pampered queen like The Boulders instead of a place that takes my choice to give them my business for granted. Bummer this place was a let down."}
{"text":"Summer special- buy one service and second service is half price.   I went with three friends for the first time.   I don't know how it is we never went before?   We go to spas often.   This is right near where I live and seems to be a \"secret\".    The facility is quite frankly, fabulous.   It is unique since they stay true to the Native American culture in all they do.   I had a custom facial with Portia.   I like this since I know the aestitician certainly knows better what my skin needs than me just randomly picking a facial.   It was wonderful.  We had lunch in the spa.   The chef cooks each persons lunch to order.   The food was very different and we all really liked what we ordered.   After lunch I had a massage with Kelly.   Once again, it was just great.   After our spa services, we got a golf cart ride over to the pool so we could go down the giant slide into the swimming pool.   We had a ball.   This is our new local spa destinaiton.  We will never go back to any of our old haunts."}
{"text":"This spa is the most beautiful and friendly that I've ever been to.  My sister and I were in town from Boston and our appointment was scheduled for the wrong day. However, the manager made sure we were still able to be serviced and the treatments were on the house. He made our experience so wonderful. We will definitely be coming back for Mother's Day again next year and will be sure to stop at Aji Spa. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"The Aji Spa is the BEST!! I've been to many spas around the Phoenix area and the Aji Spa is the only one I've revisited because it is superb! For this visit I was joined by my father, Paul. I was surprising him with a massage at Aji to thank him for coming to visit me from NH. I specifically booked Anne for his massage because I had previously had her and she is absolutely the BEST! I would've even worked around her appointment times for scheduling the massage because I didn't want my dad to have anyone but her!!!!! She is kind, patient, professional and all-around the best therapist!!! My dad also had Todd as the spa attendant, who showed him around the locker room, pools etc and he couldn't say enough wonderful things about his professionalism, kindness and pleasant demeanor. Todd even checked on my dad throughout the day to make sure he had what he needed (snacks and water since my dads diabetic). I had Yvonne for a customized facial and she was excellent too!! 
The Aji Spa is top notch!! There are so many spas to choose from in and around Phoenix and with all the choices, packages and promotions I find it difficult to narrow it down. Its upsetting when you spend your hard earned money at a spa to feel pampered and then you end up disappointed because of something. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT AJI WILL EXCEED YOUR EXPECTATIONS! I love it there so much and give the spa and their personnel 5 STARS ++++++!! Thank you again, Anne, Todd and Yvonne. You MAKE Aji the BEST."}
{"text":"This is my favorite \"special occasion\" spa. It's too expensive to go to on a regular basis, but when you have friends in town or are planning a spa day with friends, this is my favorite resort spa in town. 

Here is why this one is special:

- The experience begins as you drive down the windy road with a serene desert vista. No houses or businesses to be seen. 

- Because this spa is owned by Native Americans, their spa treatments have a NA theme to them. They use special products and techniques that are unique to their culture. 

-The atmosphere is fantastic. Flute music playing, ice water with  strawberries served, nice couches to sit on, and a great little spa store.

-My favorite person to request is Belen.  In addition to being a massage therapist, she is a healer and provides great insight as she works on you. She suggested I do a cleanse, which I did, and the results were remarkable. 

-Getting a treatment here is expensive, but worth it. You need to plan to spend the day there. If you get a treatment you can use their facilities which include a steam room, jacuzzi, workout room, sitting by the pool, and walking around the property.

-I'm not wild about the menu they have at the spa for lunch, but it's not bad. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SERVICE AND HAVEN'T EVEN SET FOOT IN THE SPA YET...
Bought the Travelzoo voucher for $79 for a 50-min Swedish Massage and glass of champagne, which states it has a \"promotional value of $145\".  Sounds like a great deal, right? 
Well, apparently there is really no \"promotional value\" to the deal other than the $79 I paid for it according to the reservationist and the Spa Manager, whom I just spoke to on the phone.  
I called to see if it was possible to upgrade my massage from Swedish to Deep Tissue, totally expecting to pay an upgrade charge, and was told that it would be an additional $56 (the difference b/t the $79 and the $135 for deep tissue)....  which is the full price of a deep tissue massage ... are you kidding me?  Started by having this conversation with the reservationist explaining to her that I paid $79 for the TZ voucher which states it has a value of $145, of which I'm guessing $10 is the champagne, that's fine, but leaves a remaining value of $135, that the voucher is worth, and that I'm willing to pay any difference in price between the massage value of my voucher ($135) for Swedish and what the price of deep tissue would be.  Makes sense to me.   I thought she was just not getting it, so I asked for a manager and spoke with Sarah, who \"explained\" that they do not even offer \"Swedish\" massage on their menu of services, but that basically, if they did it would be priced at $79, effectively making my TZ voucher have no promotional value (meaning NO DEAL) other than what I paid for it, and that means it would be an upgrade charge of $56 for the deep tissue massage.  Which is actually false advertising and I will be reporting it to Travelzoo as well.  Sarah then told me that I could go on Groupon and purchase a voucher for $40, etc... really!!  We'll see how the actual experience is tomorrow."}
{"text":"I had purchased two 80-dollar Groupons for myself and the Mr. and we used them a couple of days after Christmas.  What I love about the spa is that if you book one service, you can spend the whole day enjoying the other amenities.   We were out there for 6+ hours and had a completely relaxing time.

Started with the complimentary yoga class, moved on to massages, and then a pedicure for me.  Then lunch and drinks, and lounging in and by the pool and hot tub.  Lovely time and a great Christmas present to ourselves.  The immune booster smoothie and the hummus were both good, but the pasilla flat bread pizza is EXCELLENT!  

The employees were very gracious and friendly and overall I would love to save my pennies and go back twice a year at least.  The only negative at all had nothing to do with the spa.  There were a group of ladies there from New York and oh my were they noisy.  Everywhere.  Thankfully they weren't around for long.  I guess those quiet zone signs didn't apply to them.  I would love to be the person who walks around and politely tells people to be considerate and use their library voices.   People pay a lot of money to go out there and they don't need to hear some loudmouth yapping about their mother-in-law and their ungrateful kids and their cruddy job.  

One of the employees told me that after March they usually have some great package deals so I plan to keep my eyes out for those.  It felt like a vacation, but was very close to home."}
{"text":"Hands down the best spa I have visited in the state and perhaps the nation. 

Massages were amazing.

Drinks and brunch were amazing.

Staff went out of their way to take care of our every need.

Went at 11 am to relax for the day and stayed until 5pm which is unheard of for me at a spa once the initial massage has taken place, but this place kept me going all afternoon with the plunge pool, sauna and steam. Also, the pool and spa hot tube outside were amazing. I honestly cannot say enough about AJi and its wonderful staff.

I will return"}
{"text":"This is a very nice spa. Relaxing atmosphere. The staff is ver friendly. Best pedicure I have ever had. I have also had the facial. The girl who helped me was super informative and kind. Not as expensive as I expected. They also offer groupings regularly which is awesome."}
{"text":"This is a very nice spa and worth a visit.  I've been there 3 times. My favorite therapist is Olivia and my favorite treatment is the Desert Rain package.  Olivia gives a wonderful massage and I've had many in my life, so I think I'm somewhat of an expert!  This place isn't cheap though so be prepared.  As others have mentioned there is a 20% gratuity that is included no matter what.  My only con for this place and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I find the food selection too limited, very overpriced and not that tasty.  I only ate there once during my three trips and wouldn't do so again.  My smoothy was like $5-6 bucks and not the best.  I've had better at Jamba Juice."}
{"text":"Aji is amazing. I have done their massages and the facial once. Wow!  So relaxing. If you have any service done you get to use the amenities for the day such as the pool (with a poolside waitress for drinks and food) and the hot tub. I highly recommend Aji. The locker room is beautiful and filled with everything you need after a day at the spa to shower and freshen up."}
{"text":"Love love this spa!!! Relaxing, quiet, and tranquil!!!!!  We had a great time with the facial!!! I get my nails done here every month because they use brand products, it's clean as they use disposable equipment when they can and your needs are catered to!!! Love love love!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! I was feeling so stressed and irritable I needed a quick release of tension. Job well done thanks to Aji. The facility is large, peaceful & gorgeous. Walking thru the door brought an instant sense of peace. I booked the Pima Medicine Massage, my masseuse Belen was phenomenal. I left feeling completely lighthearted and relaxed. And I will be making this a monthly ritual, I deserve it. 
Ignore the reviews concerning price- YOU deserve what Aji provides. The entire staff was professional, friendly & genuinely kind & welcoming. For the price of a healing massage you also have beautiful views, private spa only use of a carefully designed & cared for pool, hot tub, lounges, sauna, steam room & fitness center, beautiful walking path & cafe. Easy way to relax & escape life's stresses- PRICELESS."}
{"text":"I recently had a massage at Aji. It is a beautiful spa. They have a co-ed lounge as well as a pool and hottub outside. Everything is decorated quite beautifully and was cozy. I liked relaxing out by the pool before my service. 

The lady's changing area is comfortable and they provide toiletry items for you. The lockers are modern and easy to use (no key necessary). They also have a private women's lounge as well as a hot tub inside and outside. I thought that was a nice touch. 

As for the massage, it was great. I don't remember the name of the lady who did my massage but she was very skilled. I didn't specifically ask for deep tissue but she definitely worked out some adhesions. Really relaxing."}
{"text":"A few years ago my husband bought me a gift certificate for this spa. Oh my god - it was the most beautiful spa I had ever went to! I had a facial and a massage. In addition to that - I got unlimited day usage of their spa stuff! They had a beautiful locker room that had a sauna and jacuzzi in it. An secluded area where you could lay outside - naked! They also had a huge pool out behind the spa where you could just layout and be lazy. Oh- also they had some sitting rooms with magazines, fire places -oh my goodness. It was awesome! AND - the prices weren't that high compared to other spa's in the valley. Check it out if you can!"}
{"text":"OMG!  I want to live here!  Can they set me up a cot in the back?  Seems pricey but I bought a deal on Travelzoo and got a great deal.  They service was amazing and the spa itself was clean, comfy and quiet!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to do a stay cation for our anniversary and spent the day at the Aji Spa.  This was our first time there after many years of wanting to try it out.  The spa is very clean and the staff was super friendly.  The locker rooms are large and have some nice amenities.  While there, we had a couples massage and I had a facial.  Both services were fantastic.  The service rooms were very comfortable and the technicians were awesome.  We had lunch at the cafe there and enjoyed it very much.  It is a limited menu but the food was delicious.  The fresh ingredients and combinations of how they used them were amazing.  I would actually love to come back there just for lunch!  The spa areas were nice but I did think there could be a few more amenities.  It did have a steam room, sauna and whirlpool.  I think with a few updates and additional amenities, this spa could rival some of the best.  I look forward to going back sometime.  We did join the club so I am excited to use it!"}
{"text":"If I lived closer, I would probably spend a lot of time here.  The facilities are remotely located (but not too remote) and the atmosphere is beautifully designed.  The following amenities are included with your spa purchase, or made available to you when you pay a day use fee (whether you're a resort guest at the Sheraton or a non-guest):
 + gym (included in fee with resort)
 + locker room use, which includes fully stocked bathrooms/showers, a male or female-only sauna, cool-tub, and outdoor hot tub
 + use of the outdoor heated pool (so nice!), towels, lounge chairs, and hot tub

Allow me to elaborate on these amenities... I have nothing but good things to say about them.  Let this also be a warning that you should DEFINITELY plan to take advantage of these features.  Not doing so would surely lessen the value of your treatment!  STAY ALL DAY.

LOCKER ROOM
Oh my god, the showers are from a dream...  They are simple stand-up rain shower heads, but each stall has an inner curtain and an outer curtain.  Every time a shower is used, someone comes and cleans the shower and re-stocks the shelves with: a bath mat, 2 large towels and 1 hand towel, and a razor.  Amenities that live in the shower include body wash, shampoo, conditioner, and shaving cream.  Right??  So nice!  Every gym and day spa should be so nice!  I was so impressed, that I took three showers the day I was there... no joke.  But you should take a shower before using the pool, maybe after your appointment, and after you jump in the pool, right?

If you have a spa treatment, you get a plush robe and spa sandals along with a locker/lock to store your valuables.  The locker rooms are equipped with: hair dryers, brushes, combs, cotton balls, cotton swabs, lotion, sunscreen, hand soap, hair gel, hair spray....

OUTDOOR HEATED POOL
Amazing...  it is not your typical pool... shaped like a lazy river without the river features.  There is handicap access and \"pockets\" where you can turn on jets.  The pool is shallow and more for wading and relaxing than having a full on workout; and no diving!!  Lounge chairs surround the pool and the pool pockets also allow for some privacy for you and your partner.  Umbrellas and shade is readily available as well.  Food, beer, and wine, is also provided by waitress service by the pool.  Heaven!

SPEAKING of FOOD... you can order from the cafe from 11-3.  The food is good but definitely on the healthy side..  I have to order a couple things to satisfy my pregnant hunger urges, but it was no problem.  And it tastes good!  Who doesn't like to eat healthy while on a break, anyway?

SPA SERVICES
These are expensive..  I had the mommy to be massage which was nice.  I would love any number of their other offerings, including body wraps, exfoliation, special massage, etc.. but didn't want to pay the full price (for which a 20% gratuity is recommended).  

But like I mentioned, you don't necessarily need to get a spa treatment in order to enjoy the delight of the warm pool and beautiful scene and Arizona sun.  (Darn you... locals).  I highly recommend going to this spa even without having tried any other spas in the area."}
{"text":"The spa was top notch. The service provider for my massage with foot reflexology was very attentive asking what i wanted and making sure i was comfortable to speak up if there was anything i didn't want. The waiting area was a bit crowded but the single sex whirlpool/sauna was nice."}
{"text":"Fav Spa in East Valley. Love spending a full day there. Enjoy the indigenous treatments and also pampering options in the Salon. Gym is small but adequate to work any and everything. Chicken pizza for lunch delicious and free starbucks coffee when you arrive."}
{"text":"Aji Spa is a true indulgence.  I love a basic massage with Natasha.  She is the best masseuse I've ever had.  I love that everything has a Native theme.  I highly recommend arriving early so you can take advantage of the steam room, hot tub, sauna, pool, etc.  The cocktails and food are unique and delicious.  A day at Aji is a great day!  My husband even enjoys it, we have had the couples massage many times and find that a day together at the spa is such a treat."}
{"text":"Wonderful facials! I love the organic products used and my Esti was the BEST (Carrie, you rock) She had a great firm pressure that was still quite relaxing. The facility was kinda crowded no place to lay by the pool when I got out of my treatment :-( the spa was in need of some updating but still a nice environment to relax. Their menu had great salad options but I didn't order one they looked delicious. Friendly and inviting staff which is the jewel and backbone of ANY spa! Thank you, Carrie, for being such a hospitality professional and amazing esti! I will definitely be coming back for a facial w you! :-)"}
{"text":"So disappointed. I have one spare day before a conference and decide to splurge on a massage. Everything started out wonderfully until - the power went out. Yes - not the spas fault - but how they reacted was awful. 

So you're on the table and now the lights are out. The music has stopped. Your masseuse is of course thrown off. The towels aren't hot. The hot oil isn't even warm. They have to open the door to get some light and air in - where people are running up and down the halls. You can hear every conversation  - every footstep - so much for relaxing. 

My masseuse did everything she could but it's just not a good situation. 

Massage ends, I head out to pay. No mention of the blackout. I ask about it. They are surprised that I asked. She asks the manager and they offer a 20% discount - but of course add a 20% gratuity. I have no issues with the gratuity - again wasn't the masseuses fault. But 20% discount? 70 of the 80 minute massage was terrible. It would have been more relaxing sitting in the hotel lobby for 70 minutes. 

I asked them to relook at it. The response was - you should have stopped and rescheduled. This upset me. Like I have time to go for massages while I'm working. 

She did return with a 25% discount - and a note that the manager was heading to a meeting so that's all they could do. Ugh. 

I paid. I left. It sucked. 

I'm sure if you are planning on coming you won't have this scenario - it's one in a million. The disappointing part was how they reacted. I expected more from such a high scale place."}
{"text":"The HO'DAI (Gila River Rock Massage) was 80 minutes of amazing!  For lunch the Chilled Chicken Lettuce Cup was delicious."}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Prices might seem higher than your average spa, but this is no average spa. The entire place is so peaceful. It almost seemed as if the guests were also in a complete \"chilled\" vibe. 
All I needed was a pedicure and a hair blow out. Gloria was my \"technician\". My pedicure was heavenly. And I'm loving my hair!! She was pleasant and completely professional. I felt so pampered the entire time. 
One of my favorite points about the spa is the outdoor pool , patio and cafe. I had a lovely cocktail \"tranquility \", and the kale salad which was delicious. Aside from the food, the patio is completely \"chill\". I wished I planned ahead because I would spent more time in the pool and patio. 
Every single person that works here gives you the best service ever. They are so quick to take care of you without smothering. 
I know where I'm coming on my next vacation!"}
{"text":"Aji is probably my favorite resort spa in the valley, because the spa revolves around the traditions and rituals of the Pima and Maricopa Native American tribes. They incorporate this into the Spa design, and many of the treatments. 

For example, I had a white clay wrap, and learned that the women used this indigenous white clay for beauty treatments, while the men would paint their faces with it for battles. I also had a massage, and my favorite part is that they always mist you afterwards with a creosote spray that a Pima woman makes for the spa. Maybe it's just me, but I love being on the property (tucked far away from I-10) and thinking of the native people and how life used to be in this area long ago.

**The spa is beautiful. The women's locker room has everything you could think of: brushes, combs, toothpaste, toothbrushes, hair gel, hair spray, blow dryers and more. 
**I like the co-ed waiting area, with its cozy fireplace and array of drinks and snacks. They make something called Aji bars- sooo good! They are granola bar-esque squares of fruit, oats and nuts.
**Every therapist I've ever had there has been professional, warm and very competent. Heather did my treatments this time, and she was terrific.
**The front desk girl is named Christina, and she is great at her job. She remembered who I was even though I left several hours after check-in, and remembered I'd asked for a stamp card. 
**Some reviewers feel like this is a high-priced spa. They're actually in line with the other resort spas in Phoenix. You're paying more for treatments so you can enjoy amenities like the pool, fitness classes, and the locker room with its sauna, whirlpool etc. You can pay less for treatments if you go to a day spa, without all those frills. Also, check Aji's main website page. I found the code \"New You\" which saved me 25% off treatments that were 50 minutes or more in the month of January. That's a GREAT deal. 

I look forward to another wonderful visit here!"}
{"text":"The closest definition to relaxation I have ever experienced. It is so wonderful and relaxing. The whole staff is professional and kind. My personal happy place in AZ"}
{"text":"Nice desert setting. Good for out of town guests."}
{"text":"My friend visiting me from California and I decided to have a Spa Day. After researching several spas, we decided on Aji.  I'm so glad we came here!  The facility is nicely maintained and the environment is welcoming.   Little snacks and hot tea are provided in the relaxation rooms and the robes are comfortably soft!  Both of our massage therapists  did amazing jobs with just the right amount of pressure.  The jacuzzis (there are 3 of them) were an added bonus for a relaxing soak after our massages.  Next, we sat out by the pool and order lunch and drinks.  The only thing that would have made our experience a 5 star, would have been a heated pool.  I was told the pool would be 80 degrees, however, it felt more like 65, and therefore we didn't get to enjoy it. Despite the non-heated pool, this was an amazing, relaxing experience and we will come back."}
{"text":"The Aji Spa is part of the Sheraton Hotel.
It has a nice pool and a fitness room as well as sauna, steam room, pool, and jacuzzis.

As the hotel, the Spa has a native american theme. All the treatments are using native american remedies, herbs, flavors.

They are plenty of parking spot.

After enjoying the golf, the spa is a great way to unwind."}
{"text":"Having had a previous five star experience a few years ago made me wonder what went wrong the weekend I visited the spa again.  

Cafe was great, service was great, food and drink A+.

The tranquility of my massage was constantly interrupted by someone coughing (turned out to be the therapist next door), my next appointment was given by the coughing therapist, my facial however was the best. I had requested females for my services, this was confirmed at check in. Not sure why I ended up with the male (coughing) therapist.

Pool area, locker room area, shower area...basically all needed to be cleaned up. Towels on the floor, amenities not kept up, had to requests the basics. 

First visit definitely excellent, this visit poor to average at best."}
{"text":"I visited the cafe first and LOVED the chicken salad.  It was delicious and light, which is ideal for the heat.  I got an aji massage, which was pretty relaxing. The women's lounge was very nice. I spent a little time in the sauna, steam room, and hot tub.  Then I took a shower. Their facilities are very nice. I liked that they provide shampoo, conditioner, lotion, a razor and shaving cream, toothbrushes, toothpaste, mouthwash, hair gel, deodorant, combs, brushes, cotton swabs; pretty much everything you'd need to get ready for the rest of your day (except a hair straightener and makeup ;) ).  I wish the services were a tad less expensive so I could do more, but overall, I recommend this spa!"}
{"text":"I went to this resort for a spa day, it's part of the Sheraton Hotel. Loved it!! Typical Arizona architecture but with an elegant twist and service is spectacular.

Definitely a little pricey, and beware of the 20% added gratuity. But you get what you pay for, and this spa is one of the best I've been to.  I did the SAS'HAICHU Package, which included an awesome massage, facial and a pedicure. :))) such a relaxing day"}
{"text":"My friend and I bought a Groupon for this place, I probably never would have discovered it otherwise.

Expensive, but worth every penny.

The purchase of one service gives you total access to all the other amenities. Fitness center, sauna, steam room, pool, and both the indoor and outdoor jacuzzis. As well as their lush locker room w/ showers and anything you need to go back out into the world.

We spent a couple hours by the pool drinking some fabulous signiture drinks. It was very quiet and peaceful. The view was stunning."}
{"text":"I used a Travelzoo $99 package at the Aji Spa at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort. For $99 on a Monday - Thursday I got to choose from a massage or facial plus lunch from the Aji Cafe along with a glass of champagne. Tip was not included in the $99 package price. Therefore, when I arrived I had to pay $30. Tip is 20% automatic on the full price service even though they have midweek specials on services. I chose the facial and aesthetician Portia gave me a wonderful 50 minute facial and relaxing neck and shoulder massage. I feel she made my service very worthwhile because she took the time to explain the service, we discussed my skin and skincare practices and the products she would choose and use for my facial. I have had facials, peels and dermabrasion before so I knew what to expect and the quality of the facial from Portia at Aji spa was up there with the best of them. Loved the product line too and there was no pressure to purchase that day. Just sent a brochure with me. I hate it when products are pushed in front of my face while I'm lying down on the table during the service. Portia did not do that. She showed me what I asked about after the service was complete. The service bed was heated and the room was relaxing. Very professional service provider so I was very happy with that. 

Just to touch on other parts of my visit to the Aji Spa. The check-in at the front desk was great. Quick and easy and both front desk staff remembered my name during the time I came back up to get my lunch that had been set aside since I was eating after the Cafe had closed at 3:00 pm. I had requested this when I book my appointment on the phone. They also have online booking options if you register to do so. The facilities are phenomenal. I have been to probably 10 spas in Vegas and a handful of wonderful spas on cruise ships. Aji Spa competes right up there with the best of them. I love this spa and would certainly return again. There is an aromatherapy steam room inside the women's locker room which I think they use their own Native American herbs which is just heavenly. An indoor and outdoor spa tub in the women's locker room area and a dry sauna as well. Fully stocked locker room with showers, mirrored getting ready area, etc. There is a co-ed waiting area for services or just a women's waiting lounge. The lotion, soap, etc all have an earthy, Native American kind of smell, which is very nice and spa like. I liked the co-ed area better as there was a fireplace and more seating. It just seemed cozier. Also, hot towels with a little bit of the Native American herb liquid on them. Also, the whole Aji spa is in a separate building from the hotel and resort so there is a separate pool just for the spa. Beautiful relaxing outdoor spa-only pool area with tables and lounge chairs. Several jacuzzi spa tubs are part of the pool and at separate as well. The pool overlooks part of the golf course and into the western mountain area. VERY QUIET AND RELAXING! There is even a separate little area by the pool for yoga. Plus, a fantastic fully-equipped fitness center. I didn't use the fitness center but it looked great.

Despite using a Travelzoo package for my first visit to Aji Spa, I will probably be back and paying full price because I enjoyed my visit so much and left feeling so rejuvenated. I may try to go back on a Monday - Thursday as they run specials as listed on their website. Full price would still be worth it to me. I really enjoyed my facial, lunch, the use of the beautiful facilities and the customer service I received at Aji Spa."}
{"text":"If I could give this place more stars, I would! The customer service was top notch and so wonderful and the thing that really stood out, even from the beautiful interiors and the services provided. My friends and I kept saying how nice everyone was and how they were there to help you at any moment's notice with whatever you needed. The spa has really gone above and beyond to create a relaxing experience and are very thoughtful with the smallest of details, from fresh linen towels for the jacuzzi and pools areas, \"spa chow\" to munch on in the cooling room, complimentary tea and coffee available and things like lotion, spray deoderant and a hair dryer, etc. available in the locker areas. The masseuse I had was AMAZING with a capital A and had the right pressure throughout the entire massage. It wasn't too firm or too soft. It was just right. They provide robes for the spa areas and we felt so so very special this weekend when we went. Well, well worth it and am so looking forward to going again! :)"}
{"text":"I have had the opportunity to visit Aji Spa twice and and wish I could come every week!  

Pros:
* The atmosphere: Native American decor surrounds you in the lounges, pool area and throughout.  VERY Arizonian if you have out of town guests who could use a spa day.  Bathrooms, public areas, spas, steam room, etc. are all kept very clean.
* The staff: From the front desk to the attendants to the masseuse - EVERYONE is kind and calm and very welcoming.  Even to the non-regulars such as myself.
* Amenities: Private jacuzzi, co-ed pool area, co-ed lounge, private lounge, steam room, ample space in locker rooms, showers, private bathrooms.
* Trail mix: Yes. I said trail mix. They have this complimentary trail mix available by their teas and water in the lounge and it is soooo good! A wasabi mix with just the right spice and salt... I can't fully explain - go try it!

Cons:
* My only complaint is that they close the adjoining cafe hours before the spa closes.  We had an afternoon appointment and couldn't order anything conveniently.  However, the resort itself DOES have other dining choices within walking distance for before and after your spa treatment.

PS. When scheduling a massage, I highly recommend Johnny! He is AH-MA-ZING!!!!  Experienced, professional and just overall WONDERFUL!"}
{"text":"Aji Spa is my FAVORITE spa of all time- from the few dozen I've been to in AZ & NV. It's immaculately kept and hidden away from the city at the Wild Horse Pass Resort & Spa (NOT Hotel & Casino- they are different). The grounds are beautiful- from the moment you drive into the facility down a winding desert road through a golf course with rivers and streams, until you walk into the open air reception for Aji Spa. There is a winding heated pool in back that faces the golf course and mountain range, with desert landscaping that is surreal. The pool also has jets but if you'd like to heat up a bit, there's also an outdoor hot tub. 
Hungry? Thirsty? There's a cafe selling beverages (alcoholic & non- try the Prickly Pear Margarita!), appetizers and sandwiches. 

The spa treatments range from facials to wraps to massages and more. There are separate locker rooms for women and men, and each have a sauna, steam room and 2 hot tubs. While waiting for your treatment, enjoy complimentary teas and waters and some snack mix next to the fire in the co-ed waiting room. 

I do wish the treatments were just a little less expensive so I could go more often, because they are amazing. The team at Aji has gone out of their way to incorporate the Pima indians beliefs and natural elements into each treatment and it's that attention to detail and local flair you cannot get anywhere else. I have yet to meet an Aji spa employee that wasn't attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. Go to Aji soon & you'll see what I'm talking about!"}
{"text":"What a place! I must say this was my favorite spa experience ever. Most of it is due to the pleasing flow and layout of the facility. You'll have to see it to understand, but the way the locker rooms, lounging rooms (both same sex and coed), pool and treatment rooms are arranged just make for a comprehensive relaxing experience. When you purchase a service, you are invited to enjoy the spa amenities all day long, and having just arrived from out of town, I did just that. We did the Mustangs and Massage package, which was fantastic - lunch, horseback ride to see the wild horses, and massage. The only suggestion I'd make is that they could have given us an alternative to the 2PM horseback ride in 104 degree weather. To be fair, that ride was what I was looking for the most - but as an out of towner, I'm simply not equipped to understand just how powerful that dry desert heat and pounding sun can be. I definitely recommend the horseback ride in the morning or an more temperate days. Although I loved the riding and the scenery, the heat was making me sick and there's just not much I could do about it - I have Chicago blood! So an alternative would have been nice, or a reschedule for later in the weekend, when the temperatures fell to more seasonally appropriate numbers. But it's a suggestion, not a complaint - hence the 5 stars. If I'm ever out that way again, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Celebrated my 60th birthday with my mom and 2 sisters. It was magical! The service was A+++  I had a mini facial with Maggie  and a full massage with Jen. The whole staff was kind and professional.  The amenities are wonderful, from the locker room, sitting areas  the steam sauna, the many hot tubs, lounging by the heated pool, basking in sun with the mountains in the background! The lunch was so gourmet and the selection would please any palate! Treat yourself, a spouse or a friend! We stayed for the incredible sunset! Awesome! This Pittsburgh girl will be back!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service and amenities!  One of my favorite places to relax and unwind!  Clean, well appointed and remarkable service!"}
{"text":"Life can be stressful and it is good to know that places like Aji Spa exist to quiet your mind and be pampered. I have only been to one spa before this in Santa Cruz, so this is not a spa girl gone wild review. 

I walked in and was pleasantly greeted by a nice gentleman with a soothing voice. A woman came over to show me the amenities, provide a locker and the coziest warmest softest bathrobe I have ever worn. Before my massage, I sat in a cozy room with a beautiful adobe fireplace where I listened to peaceful flute music and drank cucumber water. The room was so peaceful that I felt relaxed before I had the massage. There was another woman also waiting in the room, but the place is big enough for two or three to sit and not have to talk to each other. (I personally don't like chit chat before a rub down.) 

I had a 50 minute massage from a lovely gentle giant. He layed hot towels over my back and feet during the massage, and applied perfect pressure. I was in heaven the entire time. 

The pool was closed the day I was there, so I hung out in the hot tub most of the time. There was one in door and one outdoor hot tub. Both of them were lovely. The inside tub could most likely seat about five comfortably. There was a large bowl next to the hot tub filled with iced washcloths to place over your eyes - they had cucumbers in them - really interesting for someone not used to this treatment. (no - I didn't eat them!)

I tried the steam room and the sauna but just am too immature for this stuff. I felt like I couldn't breath in the sauna and I couldn't focus my eyes in the steam room. Both rooms seemed like they would be nice experiences for those who like this sort of thing. 

I would go back again all the time if I was a millionaire, but my peasant salary only allows me such experiences about once a year."}
{"text":"Very relaxing environment,  peaceful & you are well taken care of here.  My husband & I had pedicures & massages & I also had a manicure.  Mani pedi's were each well done & the technicians were very nice, professional & skilled.  My massage by Mike was out of this world!  Mike is kind of a giant of a man, a gentle giant if you will with magical hands.  If I lived in AZ, I would be here at least monthly if not more.  My husband's massage on the other hand left a lot to be desired.  He couldn't remember the woman's name who performed his massage, only that she was from NJ & he felt like she was just going through the motions & he came out more tense than he went in as a result.  The moral; make sure you get Mike for your massage, you won't be disappointed.  

PS - there was another woman in our conference who also had Mike & we were in complete agreement on how skilled he is."}
{"text":"Went here for my 25th birthday for my first day spa experience ever. I will not go anywhere else in the Phoenix area after this. Relaxing. Experience. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Aji Spa is a hidden treasure surrounded by a beautiful golf course and gorgeous trails with crackling creeks and amazing wildlife all around. 
I've been to dozens of spas across the country and Aji is my very favorite. If you book a treatment, you can stay all day to enjoy the heated pool, indoor and outdoor jacuzzis, sauna, eucalyptus room, a gym, take a yoga or meditation class and have a superb lunch on the patio. 
Their lunch menu changes seasonally and offers sandwiches, delivered delicious salads, cheese boards, bruschetta and much more. I love the Aji colada with toasted coconut....to die for! 
Aji is truly an oasis get away for couples or just with your girlfriends.  You will leave relaxed and rejuvenated! 

Keep an eye out for their groupons or season specials.  If you use the amenities and stay for the day, the prices are amazing! 

My favorite treatment is the veeshee room...warm water massage with a scrub.   Ahhhhhh, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This Spa is so tranquil. From the moment you walk inside it is so relaxing. The architecture and design to even the locker keys the attention to detail is wonderful. I had a massage and facial, and I must say the facial was even better than the massage. They used native american herbs and it was lovely. I think what stands out about this spa is that they have an entire private pool area as well as a spa restaurant that is for spa guests making it feel even more exclusive and tranquil.  We had the spinach salad with grilled chicken and it was so light and tasty. We ate out on the patio with a view of the lovely pool with lots of lush desert plants. There were lots of lounge chairs and misters around the pool and jacuzzi to make it feel cooler and more comfortable outside. My friends and I spent the entire day there and we stayed until they closed. I only wish I could have booked our treatments earlier so I could have more time to enjoy the lovely spa amenities."}
{"text":"Stayed at the resort this past week, and I enjoyed the high quality spa amenities.  The women's lounge, underground hot spas, steam sauna and dry sauna rooms, all were top notch.  It was a truly relaxing experience in a serene and beautiful sanctuary.  I also had a wonderful and rejuvenating massage with Johnny.  The fitness gym was very clean and well equipped as well.  And lastly, I took advantage of a haircut and style with Maxine, and was very pleased with my cut!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful in every way it could possibly have been. The pricing for this spa is understandable: it is the most relaxing, offering spa services by experienced professionals. We came here to celebrate my mom's birthday. We had a full body massage, but we got there a little early and enjoyed the spa area, which offers saunas, hot tubs, a pool area, relaxation areas for lounging, and a cafe. 

I was put in a relaxation coma after the massage. Not only is it  massage, but it is truly an experience in itself. Oil is used for the massage and peaceful music is playing in the background. Relaxing and calming Scents are introduced during the massage which adds to the experience. Wonderful. 

The cafe offered a great place to enjoy lunch and some wine. I had the chicken salad sandwich and my mom got the Flatbread. Both were delicious. The Flatbread seems like it has too much going on, but it was very balanced. It was my favorite of the two dishes. 

Highly recommend this spa for a day to relax or a special occasion. The experience will blow you away. Make sure to take advantage of all of the amenities offered."}
{"text":"Very remote yet quiet with birds singing and water flowing from the riverbank for much needed relaxation.  The Southwestern decor complimented the settings quite well.  I had a little trouble finding the place since there were little signs available.  I had to go to the casino to find out the place is complete separate from the Wild Horse Pass Casino itself and tucked away with nature walks without much signage.  I drove about another 5 minutes before the spa is reached.  The place has a Adobe Design and murals that depicts the ancient Indian tribal arts and settings.  Since men consists of only about 20% of all spa business, we had to take a backseat as far as amenities in the wet area but privacy is certain.  The steamroom, Finnish Sauna, two hot tubs with jets as well as cold plunge were great.  The facial that I received and clean and well attented spa is a wonderful for a quite afternoon.  I would go back to the workout facilities next time if time permits.  Show up 2-3 hours before the treatment in order to get the full use of the spa experience."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, my favorite spa in the Valley.  The whole experience is simply spectacular.  My favorite thing about Aji is that the spa is separate from the rest of the resort, so it has its own facilities (including a spa-only pool), which makes it very peaceful and not crowded.  My facial was also fabulous!"}
{"text":"Like Sandy, I love this place! Hard to believe such an amazing place is hidden off the I-10 but once you find it, you will be in awe! Follow the signs past the casino to Aji Spa. I have been many times for the \"day pass\" where I think you pay $40.00? to just use the steam room, the whirlpool, lay out in the sun and swim in the pool. They have a women's pool and a coed pool. They told me clothes were optional but why am I ALWAYS the only naked woman?? Anyway, their facility is clean, private, relaxing and professional. They have great product in the showers-shampoo and conditioner are actually really good. They sell many spa products in the gift shop. I like going for the seasonal treatments like around winter time they start offering cranberry body scrubs and some pumpkin pumice foot massage with your pedi. Oh my gosh! That's what I call Autumn! I can say I have never really seen it get too occupied which is good but it also lends to the feeling of uncomfortable-ness (is that a word) in the locker room. I noticed most women in there are a little older and maybe not regular spa goers. Hence the \"why am I the only naked person\"? Oh well, aside from that, love it and love the helpers and staff!"}
{"text":"Heaven. Seriously, this is the place to go if you want to pamper yourself.

A couple of friends and I purchased the Groupon deal posted a couple months back. We got full facials and spent the rest of the morning relaxing by the pool. The staff is very helpful, and since we were first timers, we appreciated the directions they gave us.

The spa is beautiful, and I love the variety of teas and little goodies. The facial was amazing and super relaxing. I wish I brought my swimsuit to enjoy the pool, but it was (almost) just as good laying in a robe and enjoying the sun next to the pool. The smoothies were made with fresh, gorgeous fruit, and well worth what I paid. I expected to be disappointed but the quality was remarkable, even for a smoothie. They also had a yoga class going on, which we peeked at but skipped. Again, wish I could have brought my yoga pants so I could attend the class. There's always next time!"}
{"text":"I like to treat my mom and myself out to a spa day every once in awhile and check out the top rated spas in the valley so we can feel like queens for the day! This is the third higher end spas we've been to and it was just ok. A lot of people have highly recommended this spa so I was excited to go check it out. I reserved my mom and I to get massages and spend the day at the spa and pool. We went on a Wednesday and they open at 8, so we got there a little after 8. The front desk lady was nice and welcoming, and showed us around the facility. The robes were super soft but the outside of it looked really cheap and old and did not go well with the reputation of being a high end spa. The outside of the robes were torn and snagged and just looked bad. The spa slippers were comfortable and they advise you to keep your slippers on, but the slippers themselves seem to be a safety hazard because they were so slippery against my feet trying to walk around. I would have been safer walking barefoot. I've been to other spas where the slippers were textured so your feet don't slip out of them. The locker room and sauna/jakoozie area was really clean. We loved the eucalyptus spray to use in the steam room. The women's lounge was surprisingly small; it was a room big enough for two chaise lounges and two chairs to wait for your service. If you didn't want to be in the bigger co-ed lounge and if other women were in the woman's lounge, it would be one packed little space. The variety of teas, apples, pastries next to the fireplace in the co-ed lounge was really nice and tasty. I was thankful for the pastries because I didn't eat breakfast before going. We went in for our massages and Natasha gave me an awesome massage, no complaints there! The pool area was nice. A lot of the other spas have big rectangular lap style pools but this pool winds around and has several little branched off sections where they have stairs to enter into the pool. Although you probably can't swim laps, it was nice to pick a spot and not be so close to other guests. We got a pina colada and monsoon cocktail from the bar which were really good. The pool was pretty dirty and there were feathers and leaves and dead bees and wasps floating around. I know its impossible to have a perfectly clean pool, but the amount of things floating in the water was less than par I would say. Their menu selection wasn't too bad for lunch and they had some tasty sounding things on the menu. When we were done, we showered and all of the toiletries are provided. I wasn't too excited about the smell of the shampoo, conditioner, lotions. It had a very earthy smell which is just not for me. I know it probably goes with the theme of the hotel but just wasn't for me. I'm also a breastfeeding mom and needed to pump while at the spa to enjoy the facility longer and they were so accommodating and nice; they let me use one of their massage rooms to pump when I needed to and made sure I was taken care of and had everything I needed. All in all, very relaxing and nice spa and I may come back again."}
{"text":"I love this place.  As other commenters indicated, it's not an every week type of place...well, I guess it all depends on your finances.  For me it's for special occasions.  For when the kids, husband, work, house just gets to you and you have to decompress.  
I have tried several of their services and loved them all...my favorites are facials and the desert scrub which they do with a Vichy shower???Try it, I recommend it.  When I go there I tend to spend several hours making plenty of use of the jacuzzy, steam room, pool or just sitting around and relaxing.  I love the steam room...I feel that as I sweat I'm letting go of all my negative energy.
I have tried the cafe, and the food was really tasty.  Again, for special occasions.  
But really, my favorite thing about the spa is the location.  It's in the middle of nowhere which assures complete silence and relaxation.  Once you enter the resort's grounds it's beautiful landscape, and if you get there really early or leave late, you will see all kinds of critters and animals running around.  It's a treat.  Also, there's some hiking trails around, which I recommend before going in for the treatment."}
