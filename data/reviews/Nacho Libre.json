{"text":"Place is cool with a different stile. The only thing I didn't like was the price for what you got,I ordered a double mojito and thought it was going to be a big drink such as la destillerie type BUT no way.... I got a really small drink and tasted like water for 15 bucks plus tip????  then the food  looked good but for that price I prefer not to spend 17 dls on 2 quesadillas."}
{"text":"I'd been looking to try this restaurant for over a year now, since I moved into Little Italy. Known as one of the few \"good\" burrito places in Montreal, my girlfriend and I went and each tried a different one (vegetarian & beef) to get a feel for it. To summarize the experience, I found the service slow, the atmosphere distracting and overwhelming, but most disappointing of all was the incredibly overpriced and overrated burritos. For $15 (veg) & $17 (beef), we each received burritos that were half the size of a usual burrito you'd find at Chilenita, M4, or really anywhere else in this burrito-deficient city, and were much less delicious. So, for double the price of a burrito anywhere else, you can head to Nacho Libre for a burrito that tasted like they had nothing in them but green peppers and ranch sauce - and made our stomachs hurt for the next 24 hours. Save your self a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Décor amusant basé sur la lucha libre. Choisissez une place sur un confortable divan ou à une des table à chaises balançoire. Soirée musicale thématique variant chaque jour de la semaine, la place devient strictement un bar vers 22h.  Plats mexicain bon, mais un peu cher. Évitez les plats avec fromage fondu, car celui-ci saisi rapidement, gâchant un peu l'expérience.   Personnel très sympathique et efficace."}
{"text":"Oh yeah. Great service this place is great. We came here two days in a row because it's one of the better bars we came across in Montreal."}
{"text":"Came in. Sat down. Waited for service to come by the table for 15 mins. Then I started to try and guess who worked there... I had a dredlock dj and a kid in desperate need of a shower, sporting a baseball hat to choose from. So I waited to see if anyone was going to do something. The dj was just standing there before his set? And Mr  scabies/Baseball hat boy/ cook? Started to get something going on the grill.  Here's the problem, this same baseball hat kid was blocking the entrance while smoking a cigarette outside. Did he bother to wash his hands after chilling with his buddies? No. So if ur food had a hint of nicotine, now you know why. At that point we just left. We were too hungry to wait around any longer or be served such appalling food. No history, respect or culture for Mexican food here. It was a major disappointment."}
{"text":"Rolled into Montréal just before dinner and we found this place near where we were staying.  The decor is so cool.  The atmosphere is great.  Very nice food, excellent service, good beer selection.  The also have cool retro video games and TV programs.  Great place."}
{"text":"I love nachos so I am set out to find the cities best nachos. So of course, why not try this place? It has the word \"nacho\" in the name, it HAS to have great nachos! WRONG this place by far had the worst nachos I have had yet in the city. Not only does this place have a small menu, which is fine, we ordered the veggie nachos, which are really hard to mess up. So when we get our nachos it is fried onions and peppers with a little bit of cheese. They were awful.  Aside from the nachos, I really like this place. Great place to have drinks with friends. It looks like a super fun. They also have chairs that are swings!! But I just think they really need to put some effort into their menu."}
{"text":"Parfait bar de quartier: bonne bouffe, bon prix, ambiance chaleureuse mais surtout on s'entend parler!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place! Nice atmosphere and decoration, the drinks are good and the service is good.  The only downside is that its a little expensive for what you get. I haven't tried the food so I can comment on that."}
{"text":"ALERTE soirées à thème ! Une fois par mois le Nacho Libre organise un lund(re)di soir une soirée pyjama + film/dessin animé en mode nostalgie ! Suivie de quelques comédiens prometteurs ou talentueux qui improvisent sur l'oeuvre en question.. Soirée Maman j'ai raté l'avion testée et approuvée !  Ambiance décontractée, bonne variété de bières au pichet pour boire avec ta gang, la déco geek... et une super Nintendo avec Mario Kart.. une SUPER NINTENDO !   Bref, à refaire :-)"}
{"text":"I would have given this place 3 stars based on a handful of visits, cool decor and some interesting swing-seats. It seems like a good place for a date, although from what I remember it was a bit pricey.  I've thought about returning, until I heard that the bar management thinks jokes about domestic abuse are a good way to sell drinks and bring in business. Now I KNOW there is no need for me to return. Sexism and misogyny are bad for business."}
{"text":"Being a Nacho Libre (movie) fan, I was super excited to stumble upon this bar. The service was quick and the manager was friendly, at first. We were mesmerized by the funny wrestler themed fighting scenes on the TVs and the swinging swing chairs. The disappointments started when it took over 30 min for the nachos to arrive and they were burnt. Hardly eating anything but the toppings, I told the wait staff of the burned nachos we picked at when paying, and was told \"well I didn't wait on you, how would I know what they looked like\" I invited the gentleman to look at the nachos. He stormed over and snatched them off the table. He comped the nachos with an attitude. We had a good time, overall, just would have appreciated more understanding staff who valued better quality, for their specialty, nachos!"}
{"text":"FUN FUN FUN!   The food was great. I love a good location with great eats.  Nacho libre is always a great place to grab a beer and eats some great nachos.   I love going when I'm in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Malheureusement une mauvaise expérience pour ma part et quelques amis. Cela va à l'encontre de la bonne atmosphère que dégage ce restaurant/bar. Le problème venait du service qui n'était pas du tout à la hauteur au niveau de la disponibilité, de la bonne prise de commande et surtout du suivi des commandes. Je ne pense pas y retourner mais je ne déconseille à personne d'y aller ;)"}
{"text":"I had a great time here! I gulped away some amazing mojitos and margaritas made by the friendly, cool, and energetic staff! They were delicious, strong, and ice cold - a great way to put out some heat after a beautiful (almost summer) day! The chicken and beef tacos were fantastic! The music was cool, I was diggin' the selection from start to finish... especially when I was feeling a little tipsy and swinging away on the coolest bar seats known to mankind. Putting everything else aside, I would come here JUST to do this over and over again. As Mark G. said, it brought out \"the kid in me\"!   I'd love to come here again, however it's a little out of reach so I don't see it happening too often. But I'd love to when I get the chance again!"}
{"text":"Tacos and burritos were very bland. Service was fine.  The nachos are as bad as the owner's sense of humor. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Des photos de lutteurs mexicains. Des consoles Nintendo et des jeux classiques. Des soirées thématiques hiphop et old school punk. Des balançoires. Plein d'autres éléments \"what the fuck\" qui rendent la place sympathique. Quoi dire de plus? Les prix ne sont à la base pas à se garrocher par terre, mais il y a des spéciaux presque tous les soirs, donc c'est à surveiller. J'ai trouvé les quesadillas excellents et la nachos corrects. Ça bouche un coin après quelques bières au moins! Et puis c'est dur de trouver une autre place ou tu peux faire un tournoi de Mortal Kombat en échange où le perdant paie la prochaine tournée. J'aime personnellement la thématique \"choisis un joueur et si il score tu reçois un shooter gratuit\" durant les matchs de hockey. Tu gagnes toujours à combiner \"hockey\" et \"alcool gratuit\"..."}
{"text":"This place is a fun hang out, but to claim your food is Mexican or inspired by Mexico is ridiculous. Flavors are just missing. Do your homework!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place.   The BEST nachos I have ever had. No exaggeration.  Great service, nice selection of beer and good specials.  The place is really cool inside too.  The décor is dark and hip and edgy.  And in the middle of the restaurant there are tables with sing chairs! How fun!  I'll def visit again on a trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"La bouffe est sympa (et surtout pour ses nachos!), mais on va principalement à ce restaurant pour son ambiance atypique! Le décor rétro comporte un petit salon Nintendo suivit d'écrans défilants des vidéos passants des plus étranges au plus drôles. Sont concept de table à balançoires est unique en soit. On peut aussi y admirer plusieurs costumes de Luchador sur les murs du restaurant. Pour quelque chose de différent, chapeau à Nacho Libre!"}
{"text":"Je ne saisi pas très bien le concept du bar/resto et la nourriture était correcte, sans plus. Ce ne serait pas mon premier choix si je devais aller souper quelque part si j'étais dans le coin. J'aimerais cependant voir l'ambiance de soir quand l'endroit se transforme en bar."}
{"text":"The tacos are pretty good, not sure if they are worth $15. What they have going for them is all the TVs for the hockey games, shots if you select a player that will score and the swing seats."}
{"text":"Les drinks sont bons, mais beaucoup trop chère pour la quantité. 12$ no tips for a little class.."}
{"text":"Une fois pour une game de hockey en Séries, une fois pour la soirée \"Apporte ton roux\"... et toujours beaucoup BEAUCOUP de fun !! En été, la grande fenêtre et ouverte au complet, c'est vraiment super agréable. Les quésadillas sont vraiment bonnes, les cocktails aussi parait-il (d'après une amie), et la bière, toujours. Les serveurs sont hyper sympathiques, il y a toujours une super ambiance. Un très bon bar pour passer de bons Vendredis soirs !"}
{"text":"NACCCHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOoooooOOOOOOOOOoooooo................LIIIIIIIBBBRRRREEEEEE..... OLE!  Lol, so I saw this in a blog about bars that you should visit in Montreal and since it had vintage video game area, and a neat luchadore theme I decided to make a point of hitting it up on a sunday night for food and drink after a long walk in old Montreal.  So, like...it was Sunday, not too busy so I likely shouldnt have expected it to be lively in there and packed with people tho I did.... but it wasn't packed, and I was okay with that, just had a hankering to get down on some nachos, slam a couple of pints and call it a night. So I did!  First off, it does look pretty cool in there, lots of pictures of dudes in luchador masks on the walls, just outright cool decor, the one corner was a \"Nintendo Zone\" and had like 4 Nintendo systems hooked to a TV with some couch seating and a coffee table.... cool beans, I can dig it.  I straight up told the waitress/bartender that I was super hungry so she suggested either I get the burrito or this one particular nacho platter that I couldnt read cuz I dont speak that much french but I knew it had some sort of beef and chorizo n cheese and that was good for me, check. When it came out it was fully loaded with a buncha meats on it... the lighting in there was pretty dark so it was hard to tell what it was so I just went to town on it.... the only issue I had was that the meat was kinda dry, but I had been predrinking before I showed up and with my need to feed it really didnt matter. HOWEVER there was massive amounts of the gooeyest, thick cheese in layers all over the darn thing and I loved the heck out of it.... also I snagged a friends side of sour cream that he didnt want with his tacos and it was uber thick and very very nice. So for like.... drunk dude food, It was a real winner.  Drinks ..... I just had pints, some kinda red ale... (again i dont speak french so i dunno, it said red somwhere so i went for it) .... What I will talk about though it the neat drinks my wife was enjoying which were vodka based drinks in tall glasses with a freezie inside that tasted like whatever colour the freezie was. So she had blue... and purple... and she liked the blue one better and told me it was real good, so theres that.  Oh.... almost forgot, they have suspended swinging chairs at some of the tables alongside the bar my wife and her friend were swinging away and enjoying their freezie drinks. I think if I had gone on a busier night it would have been even more fun for us all but it was a real good time, a bit pricer, but it's not a dive so its to be expected that a trendy cool bar would cost a lil more and its worth it. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Ça, c'était cool. Quesadillas, nachos, tacos. Olé. On était 4, on a mangé comme des porcs. Pour dire que le prix était vraiment raisonnable, j'aurais pris mes tacos à 2$ de moins. Mais quand on est pompette et qu'on veut manger du manger, peu importe si c'est plus cher payé que ce que l'on avait imaginé.   Pichet de bière et spécial du dimanche, non seulement on s'est bourré la panse, mais on a donné du fil à retordre à notre foie, et c'était vraiment agréable de regarder les vidéos dégueulassement drôles diffusés sur les écrans. Quand la partie de hockey a débuté, on avait le choix entre la regarder ou fixer ces images étranges qui nous rappellent que quand on se compare, on se console.   On peut jouer au Nintendo. C'est hallucinant. Il y a des balançoires. C'est doublement hallucinant. Il y a des références à plein de trucs funky. On a ri toute la soirée. Et notre serveur, une p'tite perle gaspésienne qui nous a servi avec patience, humour et tendresse, était des plus adorables. On le salue.   Si tu veux une date avec moi, amène-moi au Nacho Libre.  On va s'aimer.  PS: Paul Pichet."}
{"text":"Best bar in Montreal! Get the Ice Ice baby- a vodka drink with a Popsicle in it. The manager is really fun and checked on us constantly and even gave us a free treat when we came back a second day in a row. Great bar, lots of fun!"}
{"text":"Un décor vraiment cool de lutteurs mexicains et des margaritas glacées--à en rendre ivre dès la première gorgée--le Nacho Libre est un bon p'tit bar de quartier. Sérieux. Je pense que j'ai une obsession avec leur margaritas... Pendant un certain temps, ils avaient leur fameuse soirée spécial margarita et, que dire outre que c'était dangereux, mais un incontournable. Maintenant, elle n'est plus et c'est triste. Mais ce n'est pas trop grave. L'important est qu'ils en servent quand même! Right? Bon. Mise à part cette drôle d'obsession, chaque soir de la semaine, il y a un bon spécial qui se donne bien avec leurs soirées hockey.   Vous avez faim? C'est un pas pire bar à tacos avec toutes les grignotines mexicaines typiques. Gourmet? Peut-être pas, mais comment dire non à un quesadilla ou un p'tit taco avec ta margarita? Impossible!   Et la musique? N'essayez pas de faire des demandes spéciales de musique latine ou de country. C'est strictement interdit. Soyez bien avertis!"}
{"text":"I always stop here every time I visit Montreal. The staff is really friendly. My girlfriend and I stopped here and loved it. The bartender whose name I can't remember (short 19 year old blonde woman) who's crazy friendly. Not to crowded for a Sunday night. Love that they have the Original Mario Cart 64. The food was ok. I had an order of nachos and my girlfriend had the quesadilla. But over all great place."}
{"text":"Nacho Libre's sexist and scary jokes on their signage and social media lose me as a customer for sure.   http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/toula-foscolos/sexist-jokes-women_b_4815632.html?utm_hp_ref=tw"}
{"text":"Short and sweet: I totally loved the atmosphere of the bar.  Crazy 80's aerobics videos playing all around the bar, the swings, the chocolate chip cookies we were offered (gratis) as soon as we walked in, the video game references everywhere... Never seen anything like it, and it was much appreciated.  However, the bartender was primarily focused on flirting with first my friend, and then another girl at the bar, and could hardly give the time of day to anybody else he was supposed to be serving.  He kept pouring free drinks, which I'm sure some people love but to me is utterly unprofessional - he is blatantly stealing from his employer!  The drink selection wasn't anything special, and coupled with the misogyny I learned of after the fact... It was fun to experience once, but I won't be back.  And there ya have it."}
{"text":"Went to watch the late Habs game and was pleased to find a projector and many flat screens around the pleasantly lit bar. Good selection of off-brand beers on tap if you like that sort of thing (St. Ambroise IPA). To sum it up: DJ mixing between commercial breaks at 1am on a Monday night. Decent."}
{"text":"I first went to this place during last spring's NHL playoffs and the atmosphere during Habs games was simply amazing. There are some funny features like the N64 console in the back, the swing seats, the funny mexican wrestlers pictures on the walls, and the weird videos they play on some TVs. It's made to be different and it succeeds well at that.  There was a decent amount of drinks variety, and one very nice thing was that we could get pitchers of IPA which is kinda rare.  On the cons side, the food is a little expensive for what it is, and we had a little unfortunate experience with one waitress. Basically the place was packed and someone stole one of our seats. When we asked the waitress if there was any other seats available, she annoyingly responded that she couldn't watch over our seats the whole night. We know that, obviously, and a simple \"I'll see what I can do\" would have been nicer. Our friend was left standing up for the rest of the evening."}
{"text":"Funky place! Came for the name (fan of the movie), stayed for the swinging chairs and the tvs playing cat videos.  This place seems to have multiple themes running - movie pop culture, video games, and obviously lucha libre, complete with pictures of luchadores covering the walls.  Funny specialty drinks - I got the Ice Ice Baby and it was super sweet! Not short on alcohol too, for that matter!  Overall a good time - glad I made the visit!"}
{"text":"These guys are woman hating misogynists who named their bar after a Jack Black movie. That should say it all."}
{"text":"not sure about this place.. its kinda hipster pretend wanna be kinda place.. with fake mexican vrais quebecois style atmosphere.. food is OK but at $20 for 2 tacos (after taxes) kinda expensive - we ended up spending $150 on 4 people some beers and food recently there.. expensive for boreal beer and a-ok food... service is a-ok as well.. even though they did not have some beers listed on a menu and ran out of chicken for tacos ;)   uve got nintendo in a back.. so thats kinda neat especially after few pitchers..   i live in a condo not too far away.. so i prolly be back.. but if u r from somewhere else and dont have too much time to waste.. u might wanna skip this place.. unless u wanna be a pretend hipster wanna be.. like me.."}
{"text":"The food, the service, the size, the ambiance, the music! All really good. The Tacos are pretty good. here's the thing, taco are usually thos crispy Old El Paso taccos, now, for once, we got the real thing with lot of sauce and seasoning. Pretty good! Every single one of them. As for the bar, well, it was pretty full so they were working drink 2 hours non stop! pretty rock n roll. Amazing drink, not expensive. So it was pretty cool to get a nice evening there. The place has a cool bunch of vintage clip of American Gladiator, and some pictures of Nacho Libre. There's a big love for the Kitsch there. For me it's very kitsch but in a fun way.  I want to got back there, the food was really good drinking food plus there's a very good ambiance. So overall, really nice spot for food ans boozing."}
{"text":"Great spot, with a Mexican wrestling theme (Lucha Libre).    The location is very convenient, easy to find parking, the interior is cool, they have these hanging swings for the 2 seater tables and a mix of leather sofas, and tables throughout the rest of the bar.  Very relaxed atmosphere, a good mix of drinks and the food was probably the best Mexican food I've had in Montreal.    I've been to Mexico a number of times and this is as close as it gets.  The Nachos were great, I had the ones with Chorizo and steak meat, and the tacos were awesome too.  Good selection of beers, from the typical Mexican variety, to the locals and ones like Stella.  Prices were great, and will be a definite repeat in the near future."}
{"text":"Nice and friendly staff: Check! Great ambiance: Check! Excellent music (a clever mix of rock and pop): Check! A lot of wide screen TV to watch the games: Check! Delicious nachos: Check! Refreshing mojitos: Check!  Looking for a nice little casual place to chill and have a drink with a few friends? Nacho is where you'll want to go.  If you happen to walk by quickly on the sidewalk in front of Nacho Libre, you might not notice anything \"special\" as the bar it is stuck between a take-out sushi place and an animal shop...  Although anyone who steps inside could easily fall in love with this little Rosemont \"bar de quartier\".  What makes this spot so charming, besides its lack of pretentiousness, is its decor.  The Nacho's red painted walls are plastered with posters of  luchadores (masked lucha libre wrestlers) each of whom have a character name and description; at first glance, they might seem tacky but these funny characters who grow on you do give a lot of personality [and... errr... punch!] to the venue.  The second decor element that hits the eye is the row of swings in the middle of the bar!  That's right, in addition to the loungy sofas, the more intimate round upholstered booths, the typical bar stools and little round wooden tables, four sets of swings are suspended from the ceiling (very interesting if, say, you were looking for a place to meet a blinddate as the environment offers a lot of conversation starters).  Salud, compañeros!"}
{"text":"Probablement mon bar favoris du quartier, soyons fou de Montreal !  Tout y est parfait, autant la nourriture, que la carte, la décoration, le coin retrograming, les vidéos loufoques, jusqu'à la tireuse à bière.  Ce bar est un merveilleux mélange de tout qui s accorde parfaitement les uns avec des autres.   De plus à chaque jour son spécial, pour moi petit (gros) plus pour les jeudis avec Margarita et daiquiri à 6$!"}
{"text":"'Dive' bar? Yeah, no kidding. Came here for a group event and we were the first patrons at the bar so you'd think that drinks would come fairly quick, but no, they most certainly did not. Some in the group got beer quickly while others had to try and flag down the waitress and then follow her back to the bar so they could join in the fun too.  The food: don't come here for it, just don't. The nachos were mostly tasteless and bad and the burrito was very, very blah, as was the salsa.  The ambiance, location and music were all great though, and who doesn't love drinking beer while sitting on a swing? The swings alone give that place an extra star. Oh, and I like the Mexican wrestler pics all over the walls: cool."}
{"text":"I like this place and I'm not that easy to please.  The vibe is cool what with the couches, swings for chairs, and friendly atmosphere.  Yes, that is what I said.  Swings for chairs.  Brilliant idea.  Great colors, and posters of awesome Mexican wrestlers.  The wrestler that dresses in a Panda outfit is the best.  When I arrived they were playing rockabilly, which immediately sold me on the place.  Food was good and so were the drinks. The staff were cool and fun.   This is a great place to take anyone, but especially people from out of town as it is very unique.  It is also a must for duck hunt and other retro video gamers.  They have an ATARI, NINTEDO, and SEGA system in the back with a couch and a big screen tv. Awesome."}
{"text":"Bonne ambiance, bons tacos, vive les vieux jeux vidéos à l'arrière. Service souvent pas très rapide."}
{"text":"Nacho Libre is one of my favorite flicks, so we HAD to check this place out!    First, the decor - yes, it's all about Nacho Libre with not only images of masked wrestlers on the walls, but the taps were masked too.  Several of the tables have swing chairs, suspended from the ceiling by chains. And there were TVs all around, first showing Ghostbusters, and then old-school American Gladiator.  Second, the food -  we had Pastor Tacos & a Chorizo Burrito.  The tacos were delightful -- small in size, but several come in an order so it's cool, accompanied by a tower of salsas and flavored oils which made it a fun culinary experience.  The chorizo burrito was outstanding, the tortilla was warmed to a slight crisp, well-balanced flavors, and very satisfying.  It's worth noting that we had originally tried to order things in reverse (Chorizo Tacos & Pastor Burrito), but we followed the bartender's recommendation and switched it up.  We were not disappointed!  Third, the beer - well, they had several beers on tap, but no IPA.  We settled on a Pilsner that was mediocre, at best.  It didn't detract from the overall experience too much, as we enjoyed the atmosphere and food tremendously!"}
