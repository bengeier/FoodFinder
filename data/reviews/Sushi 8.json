{"text":"2.5 star      I used to go more when it was sushi on 7.  No change in decor.  But Menu has change a little.


Decent salmon sushimi, Unagi and only place that I know that offer a scalp  sushimi. 



Other spicy salmon hand rolls and Maki rolls were ok.



We went at 5:30   so no mistakes with ordering, rushed service or rolls falling apart."}
{"text":"Service was a lax, food was nothing special in fact, it wasn't fresh at all. Tried to order 2 rounds of paper thin tataki and they said they ran out despite us being the ONLY table in the restaurant and during prime time Saturday. Never going back. Better options around such as yangs kitchen and kaka!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out with my family because we were craving sushi and going here was a very bad choice. The service was absolutely horrible. We had two different servers and they both had difficulty understanding English. We had to repeat our order a few times for them to get it. We waited around 20-30 minutes before we got our first food and it was not worth the wait. The sushi was falling apart! The servers also brought us 3 dishes that we didn't order. If you want Sushi in Unionville, I would highly suggest that you go to Yang's Sushi which is less than a kilometer away."}
{"text":"Old Sushi On 7, $22.99 per adult on a weekday. 

Food is average, price is cheaper than the other ayce ones in the area. They do have scallop sashimi and decent sirloin steak. Pop is included. They have liquor license. 

They play random Mandarin and Cantonese music .. not very compatible with Japanese cuisine.

They have a good variery of food but the quality is not quite there. Their tea doesn't really have tea taste either ..... and they ran out of green tea ice cream ... really? ... There has been two tables including mine for two hours ...

You can get a 10% off coupon online or they take CCUE. 

Overall, if im going to have auahi ayce in this area I'd rather go to Yang's Kitchen just down the street."}
{"text":"The service was terrible and there wasn't really anything special about the food. We came as a group of 7 and they brought out dishes to the table that we did not even order. We did not call for them to take it back because we thought that someone in our group ordered it, when really no one did. In the end, we could n even finish all the food and they charged us extra for the leftovers. For food that we didn't even order. Lol. This was the first and last time coming to Sushi 8. Used to be a regular when they were called Sushi on 7 and had actual good food and service, but now this place has gone done the drain ever since the owner changed."}
{"text":"2.4 stars
Used to come here when it was called Sushi on 7 and I noticed that not much has changed inside (the decor), but the food has definitely worsened. 
This is still the only AYCE restaurant that doesn't have a piece of paper you can mark down your orders yourself which is really inconvenient (especially if you have a large group).
Another thing I noticed is that their orders are bigger than before, so it was difficult to order things twice. Some items MAY have been microwaved (ex. Fried tofu was soggy). Items with rice (like sushi rolls) seemed to have too much rice. The sashimi was sliced really inconsistently. Some specific items I would not recommend to try are: calamari, chicken delicacies, and shrimp tempura.
Overall, I would say that this AYCE is below average and there are definitely better ones not too far away."}
{"text":"The proportion of rice to topping was way off. The rice should not be taller than the salmon in the salmon rose by 50%! We also ordered seafood ramen, and had to spit out the cooked salmon because it was stale. It actually tasted like it had gone bad. Finally, the Gyoza was bland. I always eat the first Gyoza without sauce to taste the filling but it had no taste. The sauce made it slightly better. 

I do not recommend sushi 8 at all. Yes, prices were cheap but you're getting ripped off for the quality of food they produce."}
{"text":"I used to come here frequently when it was sushi on 7 and used to really like it. I tried sushi 8 this past week for the first time and was extremely disappointed. In fact, this was the worst customer service experience I've ever had. The service was slow (took 45min for miso soup!) and they forgot about half of our order despite re-ordering and reminding the servers several times. I still don't have my surf clam sushi! When the food did come it was incomplete (for example, the tempura did not come with tempura sauce). The servers were unresponsive and in fact started talking on their cell phone while we were ordering! I will not be returning here, there are many other AYCE places in Markham with better sushi and definitely better service. I'm not one to write reviews but I felt the need for this one."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot when it used to be called Sushi on 7. Armed with a 10% off cash-only coupon (cheers: http://www.ccue.ca/tor/restaurants/sushi8_coupon/print/) I thought I would give it another try. The restaurant maintains all the old decor of Sushi on 7.

It wasn't busy when we went (late Sunday lunch), so orders came out quickly. In fact, the green salads were brought out just as we finished telling the waitress what we wanted in the first order.

The green salad is inundated with dressing. The sushi and salmon flower is packed with too much rice (the rolls were good). The salmon itself was good though. The cheese salmon roll is literally sliced cheese on a salmon roll, and cooked for a short amount of time. They stacked one of our rolls so that it would fit on the same platter as our sushi, which I found odd.

They often brought the wrong quantities of items, or wrong items. 2 avocado sushi turned to 4, a plate of fried scallop came that we never ordered. Two soups? We only ordered one.

The good stuff was the grilled beef shortribs (kalbi beef) which were tender and juicy. Oddly, the size of the rib varied between orders. The curry chicken rice was good but had too much rice.

Overall, presentation is a mess and they did their best to stuff you full of rice.

They added a 10% service charge to our bill, so a Sunday lunch came out to $17.88 per person after tax and tip.

{"text":"Drove by, decided to try this place out for the AYCE.   Terrible, lets start with the Sushi, too much rice, and the rice they use in the sushi / rolls is very blend, no flavor at all.  The gyoza wasn't great, the teriyaki beef is just some stir fry beef, not teriyaki at all.  Tempora Shrimp was over cooked or something, very mushy.  Not coming back here again."}
{"text":"So, I visited here very recently despite the bad reviews. Normally, I would take what was said in the reviews into consideration. The problem with this is that no matter the sushi restaurant, people will always hate it! I know there are some exceptional sushi restaurants that really set the standard, but not everyone can afford to spend $80-$120 on a meal anytime they want sushi. Honestly, I love sushi, I really do. Its just hard to judge where good sushi restaurants are located based on reviews, because sushi reviews all tend to sound the same. 

With that, Sushi 8 did not disappoint me. There were definitely some novel type rolls on the menu, at least for me, such as the cheese roll, but everything turned out to be tasty! 

Firstly, my favourite item is Nigiri and Sushi 8 does it right! I tried the salmon, octopus, snapper and surf clam. The nigiri is really good here- as a matter of fact, better than any of the other restaurants I have tried in Markham. They place thick pieces of fresh fish on the rice and it all holds together really nice. Let me reiterate- the salmon nigiri had some really nice thick pieces of fish. It was refreshing and satisfying to get some nigiri that was not just the size of a paperclip (over-exaggeration...)

The sushi rolls were also quite good. Most of them were basic, but they held well against any other places that make the rolls. Ex: Red dragon, spicy salmon, crispy salmon etc...It was all pretty good. Also worth trying is the cheese roll. I believe it is torched processed cheese placed on top, but dare I say it was actually pleasant to eat. 

Kitchen dishes are decent as well. I did not really like the gyoza too much- the filling was not very juicy and as a matter of fact...it didnt really taste like anything. The shrimp tempura, one of my favourites was great and crispy. Another one of my favourites, Beef enoki, is definitely worth trying if you havent before! The crunchy enoki mushrooms along with juicy beef is just a great thing texture and taste-wise. It is something I always make sure to order during AYCE sushi, if available. 

Lastly, the servers were kind. Not rude, not rushing us out, not grimacing at our large order. It was a win in the books for me."}
{"text":"Worst sushi place in Markham. This use to be Sushi on 7, which was pretty good. Not anymore. 

I noticed familiar faces working there but the food is below par, menu sucks (especially at lunch). There is literally nothing good to order. 

Won't be returning. Only a matter of time before this location closes. 

Avoid."}
