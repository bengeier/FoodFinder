{"text":"Love this little hidden gem. The best thing my family ate was the shrimp po-boy sandwich, the hush puppies and the tea. Yum. We will be back."}
{"text":"I'm so grateful that they opened up a Flavors of Louisiana in the East Valley.  It will save me the trouble of driving my family in rush hour traffic for dinner in Avondale.  It was and is worth the drive.  This new Flavors of Louisiana is more of the same.  Best Cajun food in the Valley period.  Just finished dinner there this evening and every dish was fantastic.  We ordered etouffee, boudin, jambalaya, fried green tomatoes, gumbo, a shrimp po boy, and beignets.  Each dish was a perfect example of fine New Orleans fare. Their remoulade is some of the best I've ever had and even their fries are exceptional. The service was perfect, which is all the more remarkable for a restaurant that just had their grand opening.  We met the charming owner and he took the time to tell us all about the place.  He's a true ambassador of Southern Hospitality that is oft hard to come by in the West."}
{"text":"It's wasn't the greatest but it helped with our carvings at the time.  I wouldn't make this a go to spot to eat."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp as I was looking for a restaurant in the Valley the served po boys and friend green tomatoes.  I was pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious, the staff was professional and friendly, and the ambiance took me back to Louisiana.  I plan on coming back to get my po boy fix and would recommend this place to anyone craving gumbo, fried green tomatoes and po boys."}
{"text":"Cmon is that all you got?  I've been searching Phoenix for months for a Cajun place close by so I could save the gas from driving to pappa's. Ordered the shrimp étouffée and wasn't impressed. And I lived in Kenner la for awhile so me and Cajun have met.   Service was great. Lady hooked me up w an extra side of bread... even tho my fat ass could have used a walk to la fitness.   Recommendations: po boys, garlic bread, Bo dang balls. Looking forward to giving them a second chance sometime soon."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best food I have ever had. Their po boy may just be the best sandwich i've ever had. Nice family run spot, with great service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best in the valley for cajun style food. Gator po boy is hands down the best if they have it. They run out often so get it while they do. The gumbo is addictive. Do not pass up on this. Great people and good atmosphere. Hidden gem."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious food. A real kick from the south. A little on the pricey side, but well worth the extra buck. The portions are more than filling. If you want some superb down-south cooking, I would highly recommend this place over and over again."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant through Yelp. Really good catfish and excellent service. Must try!"}
{"text":"The service is excellent. They kept our drinks full; Donnie LOVED the sweet tea. Our waitress was energetic, helpful, and had a smile for us every time she came to the table.   We both loved the fried green tomatoes and remoulade, and our dinners were great. The salads were actual greens, not just iceberg lettuce. Donnie had the trio (the seafood pie was amazing), and I had the Crab Landry. We stopped eating half way through our meals to save room for beignets. Good plan!"}
{"text":"Loved it...the red beans n rice was so authentic its a must try if you can.  I liked the crawfish but wished it was boiled and not fried. The shimp was fried but huge and big enought for one person.  Next time I will do the one meat combo instead of two meat.  Note too that the french fries are seasoned curly steak fries."}
{"text":"Love this place, been going here since we found out about them, wonderful food, decent prices, family atmosphere. Makes me miss home but the food is the best Cajun that I have had out here. It is a family run place and is super clean and very friendly staff. All the desserts are scrumptious. My favorites are the gumbo, red beans and rice, fried green tomatoes, fried dill pickles, and shrimp po-boy. Be sure to ask for some of their remoulade sauce to go with it. Yummy. They also have some creole mustard that is good too. Not a big fan of their cocktail sauce, but that is my only complaint."}
{"text":"Love the crab bisque, seafood gumbo and shrimp poboy.  I also periodically need an order of boudin balls..."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place continually rates four and five star reviews. I feel generous giving them two stars. The service was poor although the waitress was friendly. The food came out before the salads. I ordered the jambalia on the  waitress recommendation. It was obviously old and reheated. Very little flavor but touched up with some spices and liquid smoke not very appealing in flavor or presentation. We also had to gumbo as an appetizer very average at best. Even the garlic bread was poor Walmart rolls and cold, not something you expect when you are out to dinner. Seriously how do you mess up garlic rolls? Truth is we tried this place on the strength of the reviews on this site. I'm sure most of these reviews are fake. People can't possibly like crappy food that much to give it five stars."}
{"text":"I don't normally throw out five stars based on one visit, but it was a heck of a visit. Very friendly greeting and equally friendly service (like, literally equal: it was the same girl), and the food .... my GOD the food. We got the catfish smothered in crawfish étouffé -- incredible -- and a monster combo platter of normal chicken strips and fried tilapia strips. Chicken strips don't NEED to be incredible, but these were. Hand-breaded there in the restaurant, and spicier than your average frozen ones. Really flavorful. The same can be said about the onion rings.   I'm not sure how, but I managed to reserve a corner of my stomach for some banana pudding.  I don't know when it was that I last had fresh, homemade banana pudding, but I'd forgotten how good it can be.  This place is the kind of authentic I look for in a restaurant. The owner grew up in southern New Orleans, and, according to our server, knows the difference between city Cajun and out-in-the-swamps Cajun. (Not that it matters, since I'd never know the difference.)  Next time I'm trying the alligator."}
{"text":"This was real deal cooking! The staff was very generous and accommodating, as you could tell they actually cared and weren't just there for a paycheck. When the food comes out, you can tell that is fresh made, by look, but more importantly, you can taste it.  The portions are extremely generous. I've been all around the country, and to me, they have some of the best catfish that I've ever tasted.  This place is simply amazing.  One the \"forever list\" of places to eat."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! From the moment we walked we felt welcomed. Our appetizers came (fried pickels) they were great, as well as our course meal. Our waitress was very nice, not just with us but with my son as well. W will definitely come here again. :)"}
{"text":"I asked my boyfriend, \"how many stars should I give them?\" He said THE MOST lol and I must agree. The food is incredible. Real Louisiana food in Arizona, who woulda thought. I had the chicken strips and fries, basic as it sounds, it was anything but. The way they cut their fries and the way they bread their chicken is unique but genius!!!! My boyfriend ordered the 10 piece in which you can mix and match any meats except crawfish and alligator, which is fine considering the variety of meats. He ordered fried catfish strips, tilapia strips and fries shrimps. He LOVED. We both have a ton to take home. Highly reccomend. Btw, very cute and clean interior."}
{"text":"This is our first time at this place and we were pleasantly surprised.  The customer service was excellent, which is a priority over anything for me.  The menu was a little overwhelming at first but the server was patient and helpful (Anna).   I ordered the crawfish etoufee,  absolutely delicious.  My husband had the Cajun trio, sinfully incredible.  We will definitely be back.  This place is better than driving to Papadeaux's on I17, waiting 45 minutes &  paying $$$.   Please give this place a try, you will be more than satisfied."}
{"text":"Wow this place is awesome. Wish I knew about it before.  Food was great service was great and they are very friendly. Had the chicken po boy and fried pickles.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We have been trying to get to this place for sometime now. Finally made it this past Saturday. I am sorry I waited this long. We got the Chicken Po'boy, red beans and rice, and jambalaya. All of it was mouthwatering!  Usually, my wife will will nibble on something like this, and end up eating about half of it. This time, not the case. She ate just about all of the jambalaya, and I devoured mine. We will make this one of those places where we will work through the entire menu."}
{"text":"i wrote a review about this place on march 8th, 2015. i looked to see if the review was still up and surpisingly it was taken off i assume by flavors of louisiana! i will never go here again, use yelp either or refer any of my customers from my hotel to this place. didn't know business' can pick and choose which reviews they want to keep up an which ones they don't. dinner portion of the shrimp etouffee is small and service was bad!"}
{"text":"I ordered the crawfish sandwich and a side of coleslaw. Sandwich was great, slightly dry. The coleslaw was not my favorite. I like coleslaw that is crunchy and theirs is pretty soggy and flavorless. I really didn't like the atmosphere; really cheesy and a little uncomfortable. Just not a place I think of going back to."}
{"text":"I come almost every Friday... I highly recommend the seafood gumbo - it is simply one of the best I have ever had. Also the fried green tomatoes are a great way to start things off. I usually get one of their Po'Boy sandwiches and the blackened alligator is hard to beat. Don't forget to try the sweet tea for a fully authentic down South experience. Can't go wrong here in my opinion."}
{"text":"This was our first time there, even though we've driven by it 100 times. Should have tried Flavors of Louisiana after the 1st time passing by, but it was well worth the wait! Friendly staff! Clean! Amazing Food!"}
{"text":"Homey, warm service. And the food, \"Off the hook!\" according to my 7 year old. Kid portions are generous. Apps are fantastic. I feel like someone made me a homemade meal with love. A rarity now. Lunch menu goes until 4:00. It's a  really good family place."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place. Staff was extremely nice. The shrimp and catfish are the best. Nice and airy and crispy and not too oily. I also love the Crab Landry. Red beans is also a winner. I could name everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I ate here for the 1st time.  We will definitely come back for more gumbo and po'boys! Amazing food and kind staff. We will be back for more!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food at great prices. If you have eaten at Papaduex;s this place has better food at half the price. Just one thing, they don;t have waitress;s you order at the counter and they bring your food to your table, so if they are busy, and they will be, be prepared for a wait, a long wait. but worth it if you are not in a hurry."}
{"text":"The food quality was very average.  The biggest challenge was they didn't have a spoon available to provide to my fiancée to eat his gumbo with.  I have never been to a restaurant that didn't have enough silverware to provide their guests before!  Of course, the gumbo was cold by the time he was finally provided with a spoon.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great Cajun. Tried their Crab Landry and the Dunkin' Catfish which is catfish smothered in crawfish etoufee'. Whover thought of that was a genius."}
{"text":"Delicious. Enough said. Oh and the customer service is always good. Best family owned restaurant in the area. I'm going again right now."}
{"text":"Love their food, they have the best Cajun food I've ever eaten. I don't get over there enough, these folks know their food."}
{"text":"Great find. Worth the drive from Tempe and we will be back. Started off with delicious hush puppies. The hubs had catfish po'boy, and I had wonderful muffuletta and red beans & rice. Great service."}
{"text":"It has been over 40 years since I lived in Louisiana and my fondest memories of the area was the food. Taste of Louisiana has brought back those memories for me. The Red Beans and Rice are excellent and are great as a entrée or a side dish. The Jambalaya was delicious...again those wonderful tastes from Louisiana.  I've eaten the oyster poor boy several times and they almost defy description. The breading on the oyster is crunchy and flavorful but does not overwhelm the taste of the oysters. The bread that is served is crunchy and perfect with everything. I love tomatoes and I always thought the flavor of tomatoes shouldn't be sullied with anything, so I was a little skeptical of fried green tomatoes.  I have discovered a whole new world of flavors with these fried green tomatoes. The crunch that the breading supplies to the tomatoes is subtle so the tomato flavor also comes through.  Anyway I look forward to returning here a lot and enjoying their fine cooking."}
{"text":"Love the food. Hush puppies are amazing!!! Portions are filling. Been there a hand full of times and never once has it failed."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!! I have to stop by every time I'm in Arizona. I recommend the shrimp po'boy, delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Dark and savory seafood gumbo, perfectly cooked catfish and gator.  Delicious desserts.  My kids loved the dirty rice, beans, fried shrimp and gator! The entire staff was friendly and knowledgable about the food. Our new favorite restaurant, can't wait to go back again and again."}
{"text":"First time there   WAS GREAT.  The waiter was great. It was great food.  I can not wait until I go back.  Must say food was a little slow coming out but, I was not in a hurry.  Still can not stop thinking about the food.  It was so good. Great family environment.   Great job guys."}
{"text":"This place is great!  We found it while in Phoenix for a baseball tournament.  We enjoyed it so much we stopped again on the way out of town.  I will be stopping there whenever I am in Phoenix.  Shrimp po boy and the beignets are amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh cooked Cajun eats. I love the shrimp dishes the best and the po' boys. Great sides and awesome desserts!  Friendly staff, great service, clean dining area."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been in my home for just about two years and I am sad that I found this treasure just about seven months ago. What was I missing? So much goodness, that's what. I order everything with a few boudin balls!!! The people who work there are really nice. I was not sure if I wanted to order dessert and they offered me a taste. The bread pudding is wonderful. It has no yucky raisins and the greatest sauce ever to pour on top. If atmosphere is your thing than this may not be the place for you. Forget that...it's the place for anyone. I get takeout from them once or twice a month and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Great Po-Boy Shrimp sandwiches. Very good creamy potato salad and banana cream pie desert. They actually do the blackening procedures instead of just cooking and sprinkling a cajun spice over their presentations. They also have a very nice white bean side dish.  The Chicken was a bit overcooked and dry though. I have noticed that the service can be spotty too. Sometimes the wait is pretty lengthy. Polite and pleasant service though. Nice atmosphere and background music. Overall I would definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"Best food in the valley. As a native of Louisiana from Baton Rouge and New Orleans, this is the real stuff. None of the garbage people pass off as \"Authentic Cajun\" around here. Food in Louisiana isn't blackened to a crisp and doused in hot sauce and pepper like people think. It has flavor and is sloppy with sauces. Nothing here is bad, and I've had everything on the menu. Service is always good, again a wild difference from the usual AZ experience, and if you leave here and you're not stuffed, you did something wrong. If I had to change anything, they use pickle spears for the fried pickles unlike the typical coin sliced pickles I'm used to in New Orleans. I think that's just a Lafayette versus New Orleans thing, and personal preference though. Quit reading and go eat!"}
{"text":"My first and last time I go to this place.  Food wasn't fresh,  my son and boyfriend got sick!  Just 2 servers,  salad came after food. The presentation of the food was terrible.  A Jambalaya that server recommended not to order since I don't like spicy, my bf did. And tried and wasn't spicy AT ALL!!! He ended up putting more hot sauce. We went because of the excellent reviews,  but after last night,  I won't trust yelp anymore.  Totally disappointed!!!!!! The worst 80.00 spent!"}
{"text":"My first taste of Cajun/Creole food =) I came with a Louisiana-native, and she had the Crawfish étouffée & Gumbo while I tried the Shrimp Creole & Fried Green Tomatoes. I never tried fried green tomatoes before, and this will probably be my last time. I didn't like the texture of the tomatoes being fried so it just tasted odd to me. I was also expecting the Creole to be more flavorful and even spicy, but the sauce just tasted like tomatoes and wasn't spicy at all. I personally would've wanted more seasoning, but I have nothing to compare this to so maybe that's how it's supposed to taste. Overall, I liked the food and would come back again. I should've yelped this place while I was there since it looks like the Shrimp Po'Boy is the thing to get here. Next time!"}
{"text":"I lived in Louisiana for four years and this place rivals anything there. The food is fresh and the staff the best. The Juliet Rouge is a personal favorite!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! Everything they make is delish.  We just finished a king cake and it was like we were back in Louisiana!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times. Although I have never been to Louisiana I would imagine that the food at Flavors is just as good. It's always fresh and delicious and reasonably priced. The staff is very friendly as well. I have tried many items on the menu and everything is delish. They have a lot of seating as well so having a large party isn't a problem."}
{"text":"awesome food! been to new Orleans its about as close as you can get out here. peach cobbler was excellent!"}
{"text":"What a treat this restaurant is. My mother has eaten there numerous times and asked if I would like to try it. I gladly said yes and was not disappointed. Who would have thought fantastic Louisiana cuisine could be found in Arizona. From the fried pickles to the jambalaya it was all delicious. And to make it an even more pleasant experience the whole staff is friendly, warm and accommodating. Our waitress Anna has served my mother on a few occasions and she was just a delight. Her hospitality and he great food will keep me coming back. Looking forward to my next trip to Arizona."}
{"text":"Wow where do I start , was it the great hospitality, or the nice homey atmosphere?  While all of those won me over, this wonderful place has excellent Cajun food.   My husband had the Shrimp Po'Boy and gave it rave reviews.  My mom and I both had the fried cat fish and crawfish tails. I had a side of red beans and rice and my mom had cole slaw.  Both were excellent.  Great food, great service, and great Southern hospitality. All of my favorites wrapped up in one restaurant.  I can hardly wait to go back and try something else.    If you haven't tried Flavors of Louisiana,  GO it will be so worth it!  Oh and by the way the prices are great too!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. The service is friendly and the food is always excellent. I've had almost everything on the menu. Gumbo is better then Pappadeuax. I haven't been disappointed yet. One day I ate here twice. The only thing is you can't have a glass of wine if you dine in because there is no alcohol serviced there,  So I always just get it to go because it's just as fresh and delich as if you eat there.. 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"The best Cajun food ever!  So lucky to have it close by.  My favorites are the veggie po'boy and the shrimp p'boy, but oh my, that potato salad cannot be beat!  Hmmmm, thinking about the fried pickles now......."}
{"text":"My husband and I are here from Seattle visiting a friend and decided to look for a new place to try for lunch.  Yelp pointed us in the right direction.   The food here is excellent, customer service outstanding, and the environment inviting.  We have been wanting to try alligator but never got the chance until today.  Happy with everything we ordered.  Would give 10 stars if I could.  We will be back ."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is very cute and small. The food was good but I think a little overpriced. We ordered a variety of everything because when you try new places you always want to try out a little of it all. The black beans and rice, I would have enjoyed a little more spice. If you had black beans and rice in Louisiana before you know it has a kick to it. I would go back, but not on a regular. The place was ultimately clean. The bathroom was off on the north side when you enter. They have all these flyers and brochures there for businesses . Services were quick and fast."}
{"text":"Don't order the catfish...they are selling swai fish which isn't real catfish. The texture, color, and the taste aren't the same. Very misleading !!!!! This is Not authentic food! You can do better by getting a box of zatarans dirty rice from the grocery store and just add water!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food today, had the Alligator and Crawfish. Also the Gumbo was very good. My Wife mad Sons had the Shrimp Po Boy and Jambalaya. I will be returning"}
{"text":"Finally made it! We have heard such great things about the food and the rumors are true!   I had Gator and Oysters, red beans and rice. Delicious!  Hubby had Shrimp Étouffée. Delicious!   We even saved room for dessert. (Taking the rest home) Bring on the peach cobbler!"}
{"text":"This is the best Cajun place in Arizona. The portions are great and the people behind the counter are really nice. I love gumbo and I have tried several kinds here and all of them were excellent. Yes the decor isn't 5 stars but seriously if you're more worried about mood lighting and soft cushions you can go to Pappadeaux's and get charged an arm and a leg for lower quality food. the drive and the price are definitely worth it for this place."}
{"text":"Didn't really care for the dish I ordered but loved the fried green tomatoes and onion rings."}
{"text":"Had the fabulous ettoufee. The roux was very tasty and the Crawfish were wonderful. Finished it off with Binet which were fabulous also. Really good place to eat.  The wait staff was pleasant and inviting."}
{"text":"As always the food and service were exceptional. The Oyster poboy is flavorful and the red beans and rice is great. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Having the seafood gumbo with boudain and sweet tea... Like bwing in da Souf in da Wild Wild West"}
{"text":"Decent shrimp po' boy, and better red beans and rice. Would've been a three star review otherwise, but the gumbo was so salty I couldn't eat it - thin, coffee-colored broth and overly fishy-tasting. Almost like the roux broke down and lost its thickening ability. Maybe this batch was just off, or had been sitting for a while.  Nice folks run the place, and I hope their recent expansion works out well."}
{"text":"Best Cajun food in the WV.  Excellent selection of some Louisiana favorites."}
{"text":"I love Cajun cooking and this was wonderful! Great catfish, red over dirty, and crayfish. The peach cobbler was SOOOOO good. I highly recommend this restaurant. However, it is not for the \"ambiance snob.\" It is like a family cafe (which is what it is) with very friendly staff. I will return!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal. Absolutely phenomenal. Low key place that you wouldn't find unless you got a word of mouth recommendation. Easy going atmosphere with great service and even better food. In and out in 30 minutes feeling satisfied but can't wait to come back. Got the crab Landry and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Loved this place. the food took me back to my childhood when my mom's friend would visit us from Louisiana and make real backwater Cajun food. The seafood gumbo was spiced just right and was a very large portion. The Shrimp Po'Boy has HUGE, there was enough of the sandwich to feed 3 people. Finally the shrimp etoufee was good both not great.   The only downside is the restaurant itself....its very small but very busy. It was standing room only when I was there on a Friday night.  it would be great for a small group but there is only enough room for maybe 30 people in the whole place.   i WILL be back and I am looking forward to eating yummy Cajun food."}
{"text":"It was our first visit, & we had a great lunch there today. Will definitely make it one of our favorites. My blackened catfish po boy was sooooo good!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! The waitstaff are friendly and knowledgeable. Carlee is fantastic! The environment is fun and comfortable.  Sometimes it takes a bit for your food to come out as it is made to order but well worth the wait!  The fried catfish- best I've ever had, red beans and rice- comfort food deluxe, and the outstanding Joliet Rouge are some of my favorites. Don't miss out on the sweet tea and the homamade cheesecake with praline sauce. There are no equals anywhere!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My favorite is the shrimp with onion rings but all food is really good. The service is good so I will recommend it if you are into seafood."}
{"text":"One of my church members told me about this place so we tried it last night the par ran was delicious, seafood gumbo was to die for. My hubby on his way to get more today.   I sample the alligator taste like chicken, sweet tea was perfect. I will be back.  Surprise,Az"}
{"text":"Best food that a kid could have and really nice workers and I love it.  Anna is super nice she always  checked on the customer. Grandson loves this place. He wrote the review."}
{"text":"We tried out the shrimp Po boys. The flavor was unbelievable. The right amount of spice fused with this awesome Cajun mayo. The jumbo fried shrimp seasoned and cooked to perfection. I will definitely be coming back again. Two thumbs up. Best I've had in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Now this is food that tastes like it could have come straight out of the bayou! I have been to most restaurants that have cajun offerings in the Phoenix metro, and this is by far my favorite.  I highly recommend the alligator po boy and the gumbo. I love the atmosphere in the restaurant! Cajun is supposed to be a fun festive food with heritage, not upscale dining where it seems like you are in downtown New York rather than New Orleans. I just wish they were open a little later."}
{"text":"Wow!  A bit of the Big Easy on the west side!  You'd never know there could be such good food in such an unassuming place.  I read the reviews here and decided that a little Cajun sounded like the perfect change from the usual.   So, I was a little hungry and I couldn't decide between the oyster po boy and the catfish combo, so I got both!  Both dishes come with a side so I also got two sides.  I went with the cole slaw to go with the po boy and red beans and rice to go with the catfish.  The po boy was awesome!  The oysters were hot, crisp, tender inside... the bread and the condiments inside were the perfect wrappers to deliver those oysters into my mouth!  The first half of the sandwich was gone before I knew what happened.  Yes.  The first half.  There are two 6-inch sandwiches to this po boy!    So before starting on the second half of the sandwich, I moved over to the catfish.  Again, I wasn't disappointed.  Lightly battered in corn meal, the catfish was hot, tender and tasty.  But, after having two of those tasty pieces, my stomach realized that there was already a six inch po boy in there and started to complain.    Realizing the limited resources and limited time before my stomach wins over, I quickly took bites out of each of the remaining side dishes.  Both winners!  Will definitely be back, for the food and the service!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food great prices. If you're looking for something different while you're in Arizona them this is for you. It's a little hard to find but don't pass it up."}
{"text":"The food was excellent as always but the service definitely has to improve, this was the second time in a row that it took long for refills and the appetizers came out at almost the same time as entrees. The food is so good that it's worth it though."}
{"text":"My husband and I chose this restaurant based on the existing positive reviews (4.5 stars with over 300 reviews), but we were sadly disappointed.   The decorations are quite tacky and the whole place lacks ambiance.   We broke tradition and both ordered the Dunkin Catfish. The mixed greens side salad with Cajun ranch was the best part of the meal. I will admit that the catfish had great crunch, but the breading was a tad too salty and tasted like a mix. The dish was served with garlic bread, which was just ok. How is garlic bread Cajun anyways?  I will say that the staff were friendly and super helpful! For their sake I hate to say the meal fell short of my expectations, but it just did."}
{"text":"Attentive service. And my Louisiana friends won't understand this, but food prepared even a little better than you'd find in the Louisiana heartland. Probably because this restaurant isn't constantly pummeled by tourists who just want \"something Louisiana.\"  -- I think Flavors of Louisiana faces high expectations from an audience that knows what good Cajun food is all about.  And from I see, these boys and girls know how to deliver.    If you were a Louisiana local, you'd expect some special attention -- and the Flavors of Louisiana crew delivers."}
{"text":"This is a cute spot for lunch or dinner. My rating today is based equally on the food and on the service. For the food, we got the Fais do do and the crawfish and alligator for starters. The fried gator was a little small, but big in flavor...keeping with the cajun tradition. For entrees, we had the dunking catfish, crawfish etouffee, shrimp creole, and the trio of gumbo...jambalaya..and crawfish pie. Gumbo was good, but something was missing...can't put my finger on it. Crawfish etouffee was also OK, but off. I asked and found out they use the same roux for the etouffee as the gumbo. That should not happen. The others were good. So, the food gets a three star, but the service an employees get five stars...resulting in a four star. I will definitely go back and have more gumbo and enjoy the ambience!"}
{"text":"Husband and I went for dinner and we really liked the food.  He had a shrimp PO-boy and I had the Crab Landry.  The crab dish was good but a bit too much rue.  The shrimp that came on top is what made it good.  We both agree the best part was the red beans and rice he got as a side.  We took home what was left (PO-boy filled him up) and I reheated it and mixed it with my gumbo and it was great.  4 stars because I had to wait awhile for my plate while my husband was almost done with his due to mixup in kitchen.   Loved drinking from a mason jar too! Just like home!  Go here if you want Cajun fast food and Pappadeaux's if you want a nice sit down Cajun meal.  Either way they are both good."}
{"text":"Flew in from Houston for business.  Wanted to try some cajun in Arizona.  Was really impressed! We has some onion rings which were awesome.  And I had the Dunkin Catfish which was also really good.  Plenty of food.  I would have given 5 stars but service was a bit slow.  Otherwise you get plenty of REALLY good food for a good price."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim. I'd never had cajun food before and I was curious. The restaurant was cute. The decor had a Louisiana-summer-night-on-the-porch vibe. I went with the Crab Landry, a crab stew served on top of garlic bread with fried shrimp on top. The shrimp was outstanding! The stew was hearty and warm. The sweet tea was also really good. Not too sweet at all. It was a bit of a wait to get seated, but it was worth it. I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"The shrimp creole dish was out of this world.  It was a little spicy just the way I like it.  The Peach Cobbler was the best I've had.  I enjoyed the atmosphere, music    and the service.  I felt like I was having dinner in New Orleans.This will be my go to place for a great meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING! We have spent a lot of time in Louisiana and think that the best Cajun food we have ever had is right here in Phoenix! My favorite thing to eat is either the shrimp or the crawfish po boy! Their gumbo is a close second and the desserts...I could write a whole review on the desserts alone!    Although restaurant's like Pappadeaux have a much larger menu/selection, nothing beats Flavors for it's authentic, delicious Cajun cuisine!  The owner and her family are wonderful!  We love the friendly, \"your eating dinner at our house\" type of hospitality you receive. We have been in several times and they know many of their customers names and remember the last time they were in!  Flavors has become a family favorite and if you have not tried it yet, you are in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Let's start by disclosing that I grew up in New Orleans, went to school in Lafayette (home of the Ragin Cajuns), and REALLY know good New Orleans/cajun food. I grew up eating great po-boys, gumbo, red beans, and wouldn't consider eating any of these if not well prepared. That said, I can truly say that Jennifer and the Flavors of Louisiana gang make cajun food as good as any you'll find in New Orleans--SERIOUSLY. The po-boys are spot on (though the bread could be a little crustier) and the chicken & andouille gumbo is even better than mine--and, I assure you, that's DAMN GOOD. Frankly, I've never had better. The only thing that is not \"as good as it gets\" is the red beans and rice. They're good, but not quite the creamy \"Washday Monday\" staple that I grew up on. My cajun grandmother has Jennifer beat on that one, but not by much.   But, if you want a special treat and want to taste something that kills all, get a sausage po-boy. Hot sausage or smoked sausage po-boys are a New Orleans staple and my favorite po-boys of all. But, Jennifer blows them all away with her home-made andouille. Simply put, I've never had better sausage--ever. It's the reason her gumbo is soooo good and her po-boy the best ever.  I've eaten at Flavors many times, even though I live across town. Every time I go, I eat like a pig and bring some home to eat later. I have no affiliation with the restaurant, but wanted to post this as a review from someone who really knows New Orleans food and as a thank you to Jennifer and her crew for giving me a source for the best flavors in the World (not just Louisiana). As a matter of fact, I even overlook the fact that Jennifer is from Baton Rouge, instead of New Orleans or Lafayette and for not having any USL/UL Lafayette paraphernalia on the LSU/Saints wall. At least that is, so long as she keeps her promise to open another restaurant on the east side of town--that is, a lot closer to where I live.  If you want the ONLY good cajun food in Phoenix, treat yourself to Flavors of Louisiana. For me, it's just like a visit to any of my favorite po-boy shops in the old neighborhoods. It really is that good."}
{"text":"Never a bad meal at TofL. I crave the red beans and rice and happily make a meal out of it. The Hubby always gets the catfish. We have tried every appitizer and if you like fried foods you cannot go wrong. Go ahead, try the alligator, it is good and you will have bragging rights for being aventouous."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. GOOD. Very good! My husband had been nagging me to try this little place, but we are late dinner people when we're out, so the \"earlier than most restaurant closing hours\" didn't mesh with our schedule for a few weeks. It was worth the hassle to coordinate!! The Dirty Rice was incredible, and may just be my new favorite order out comfort food. We also had fried oyster Po' Boys, and oh my heck, they were THE most incredible sandwiches EVER. Give this tiny lil place a try, family and locally owned!!!!"}
{"text":"Great friendly little place. They have killer seafood gumbo and can't miss peach cobbler. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm a huge fan of all things rice and spicy food, and this place has more than a bit of both. Anything with rice there is top notch, the hush puppies are amazing, even the gator isn't bad. I now come here often and even have brought some friends."}
{"text":"Something different in the valley! You got to try this place.. Alligator and dirty rice, mmmm so good. Its kind of hidden though."}
{"text":"This place is great! Food is amazing and they always have my food ready when I call it in. The employees are always very friendly as well. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just had another wonderful meal at this small neighborhood eatery.  I haven't been there in a couple of months but was amazed that the owner remembered that I like my soup piping hot!!!  The gumbo is delicious and the rich flavored seafood stew over rice, (sweet from crab, shrimp and crayfish) is worth going back for.  The owners of this place definitely have a special touch with the food and truly aim to please their customers.  Be sure to introduce yourself to Miss Jennifer.  She will remember you and your name the next time you go back.  Oh and try the Po' Boys........they are packed full and have just the right amount of crunch."}
{"text":"Ive never tried cajin food so as my first time trying it at flavors I must say they made me a believer!! I had the gator strips seafood gumbo and shrimp po bo and thank god I did I keep begging someone to go back with me but noone ever has time so I guess I'll be in there soon and I don't even care!!! Cant wait"}
{"text":"Always try and hit up the unique local joints when I'm travelling.   Flavors of Lousiana has the bonus of being near my company approved hotel so boo-yah!    I was excited to see Po' Boys on the menu but disappointed that the genesis of the Po' Boy - the roast beef with debris gravy - wasn't on the menu.  Seems a little counter intuitive.   Nonetheless, I had the crawfish po'boy which was on a very solid role and pretty darn tasty.  The gumbo was the star for me though - nice rich broth that you can tell came from a nice brown roux.   It was full of flavor and made me wish I had gotten the next size up.  Good place - pretty close to authentic but loses a star for not having the roast beef po' boy on the menu."}
{"text":"It's like the all mighty him/herself came down from heaven and delivered this place to us folk in AZ that have a love for Louisiana cooking ..  I spent a week vacation in The Big Easy for Mardi Gras and it feels food wise as if I was transported back there. My Co workers told me about this special place so glad i came for myself, give it a shot u won't regret it.  Just take you stretchy pants 1st.."}
{"text":"First time there and I was very impressed! I'm from Texas and went to Louisiana just for the food. Trust me when I say, you won't be disappointed. This place is legit. Gumbo has so much flavor!!"}
{"text":"Simply stellar. We've been here twice and loved everything. The fried pickles are the best and the desserts are worth the trip alone.   Friendly staff and homemade everything makes this place tops for our family."}
{"text":"Just come in and order some catfish, chicken gumbo or anything else on the menu. I'm having a catfish po boy and chicken gumbo right now. You will be happy !"}
{"text":"Dear Flavors of Louisiana,   I love you.   - Kristen A.   We had the crab landry and scrimp po'boy last night. Amazing as always! No matter what we get, I am never disappointed. No matter how slammed this place is, the service is stellar. They always make us feel like we are not only welcome, but family. I will see you soon flavors."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on Yelp. Visiting AZ for Spring Training and needed a place for dinner close to Glendale. Reviews sounded promising. We had a hard time finding the place but persevered. The place looked promising when we walked in because there were a lot of people there. A good sign. I had the muffuletta sandwich and husband had the jambalaya .  Both good. Serve was slow .  The gal said there was one less cook that day.  But the staff was very friendly and helpful and apologized. Others in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying their food, too"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Great environment for all occasions. Friendly prompt staff were on point with their service and the food was delicious. I recommend the Cajun trio. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Incredible food!!!!  Best Po Boy ever!!!!  Love all their specials!!!!  Cajun chips are the best!!!  This is a family owned and run business.  The owner is one of the best cooks in the country!!!"}
{"text":"First know I am from the desert SW so I did not grow up on this type of food and in fact this is my first experience with Louisiana style food. Tables seemed greasy and interior is old and worn. I had the fried alligator po boy sandwich which was ok, nothing great, and a half order of fried green tomatoes which were very thin, flavorless and swimming in a pool of grease. The waitress was very pleasant and I did have the unsweetened iced tea which tasted like it was made in the sun, very good therefore two stars for the waitress and iced tea.  This is not a place I will spend my money at again."}
{"text":"Went with the family and I had the crawfish po'boy and my brother had the Saturdays catfish special. We both enjoyed our meal, I loved the bread the po'boy was served with!  I love seeing local businesses with great offerings. If ur around u should try it out!"}
{"text":"I got a po boy and while it was good it felt like there wasn't enough shrimp for the price and way too much lettuce. The flavors were nice, but I think if the bread had been toasted it would be better.   I know they are new so I will give them another chance and try something else on the menu.   I would recommend to them that it's ok to come out from behind the counter and greet your guests. It is a big distance from the door to the counter and since you're a new place it might help people feel comfortable especially for their first visit."}
{"text":"Have traveled many times through Louisiana and we always stop to enjoy Cajun cooking.  The Po'Boy sandwich, in our opinion, is as good as we have had in our trips.  First time visitor, but will be back.    They will be expanding the seating area as the lunch hour, the owner told us, can be very busy.  Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Po Boys here are great. I switch between Alligator, Crawfish and Shrimp.  They're all tasty."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I keep coming back for the shrimp Po boy. Quality ingredients cooked perfectly. The customer service from the girls running the place is also top tier. They went above and beyond to make sure I leave satisfied. I can see that they care about what they're doing. Thank you for consistently feeding me delicious meals made with great ingredients."}
{"text":"I've been using Yelp for years and have never left a review. With that being said, I'm so grateful there's a decent restaurant in the west valley that isn't a chain! The quality of ingredients, the service, and the food are all awesome (for Arizona). I haven't been disappointed with anything I've ordered yet.  I'm leaving this review because I've been to this place 3 times in the past couple of years and the experience hasn't diminished over time like many other local establishments. Hopefully they keep it up and they stay for years to come!!  This is easily one of my favorite places to eat and can't wait to share it with more people"}
{"text":"Wow... This place is great! Definitely try the alligator po' boy. Great service, great food! We will be back."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic. We had a great server and our food came out promptly. Unfortunately the Jambalaya tasted like it was days old, and the rest was really just terrible."}
{"text":"So...I went to the Flavors of the West food festival this year and got a discount card for various places to eat at. Flavors of Louisiana was one of these places. A friend of mine had spoken highly about it recently...I happened to be in the area and figured I'd try it.   They open at 11a and I arrived 10 minutes early and figured I'd try and see if they would serve me and they were happy to place my order. Had a few questions about the menu and again...they were happy to explain what a few items were.   I ended up ordering the Cajon Trio...a bowl of Jambalaya, bowl of Gumbo and a Crawfish Pie. I had a choice between the seafood gumbo or the chicken and sausage gumbo. I asked she recommended and she said the seafood gumbo was a little fishy. I went with the chicken and sausage. Have to say the chicken in the gumbo was a little dry but the flavors were on point! The Jambalaya was BOMB!! The most surprising item on the menu was the crawfish pie. Really delicious flavor and the crust was perfect!! Not to mention it was filling. I'm ways tempted to order more food than less and I'm glad I didn't order a second pie. The side order of catfish could hands down be ones do the best I've had in the valley.   The only reason this review is 4 stars instead of 5 is the chicken. I'll be back this weekend and I'll have dessert this time around."}
{"text":"It's AMAZING! Their shrimp po' boy is delicious!!! And last night was my first time having their peach cobbler.... It was marvelous!!! Definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Shrimp creole was great. So was the chicken and sausage gumbo. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!! What a fantastic experience.   Coming through the doors you are transported to Louisiana, the decor, the music, the friendly greeting by everyone who sees you.   My girlfriend and I were prepared to sample and share, we ordered fried green tomatoes, onion rings, hush puppies to start. Each seasoned perfectly.   Then we moved on to Cajun trio which had Crawfish Pie (the crust is out of this world good) which CAME WITH jumbalaya and gumbo!!!!! Who does that??? Each was amazing on its own. We also shared the Joliet rouge, blackened catfish with etoufee on top. Holy hell, it was everything you hope it to be and more!!  The best part of this experience was Catherine. She was warm and funny, and made us feel like we were lifetime friends. She had refills to us before we noticed we even needed them. She's a big reason why we'll be coming back to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The ambiance, service, and food was outstanding. I ordered a cup of Gumbo and it was steamy, flavorful, a little spicy, and delicious. My husband ordered a shrimp Po-Boy. The bread was fresh, the shrimp was crunchy and nicely salted, and the sauce was tasty. My kids ordered from the kids menu and their fries were good. We finished our meal with some fluffy, warm, and sweet beignets. Food made with love. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent establishment. The food is very good. Had the red beans and rice, crawfish po boy, fried green tomatoes and pickles and crawfish etoufee.  Then to top it off a Pecan Praline Cheesecake. Ump Ump Ump. Had my fork dancing in the air. The staff is very friendly and fun. The music was playing and made you feel like you were in Louisiana and the beignets very good with lots of powder sugar. I will definitely be back. You guys are great. Good Cajun/Creole food in the middle of the desert. Hit the spot. And we will be back for The Shrimp and Grits on the Special Days."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. Everything fried was done perfectly. The staff was welcoming and attentive.  We will be back again soon"}
{"text":"Really good food and great service our server Annie was amazing. We sure will be coming back."}
{"text":"I had the seafood gumbo and tilapia po boy sandwich lunch meal. It was good. Just not enough gumbo. Had a side of red beans and rice for $2.99 it should be $1.99  prices are a bit expensive but food was good."}
{"text":"Contacted by the owner about my review. She offered to refund my money for our dinner and invited us to try them again. Since I don't live in that area she kindly sent us our money back. She was very nice about our experience and apologized that it was not what we expected. So I really hope it was just an off night for them when we were there."}
{"text":"Been here several times already.. This place is the bomb! Four of us came here today and polished our plates.. Yum!! The service was good."}
{"text":"Amazing food, very authentic. I'm from Louisiana and I love it! Love, love, love. Great everything here!"}
{"text":"My favorite Cajun style food in the Valley.  Everything is homemade and always delicious. My favorite is fried catfish,  but I love their crawfish dishes as well.   It's a simple place,  but the food and service are fantastic."}
{"text":"I love this place! The restaurant has a very homey feel to it. During my most recent visit I had the seafood gumbo, it was very tasty and full of flavor! I have also tried the crawfish and alligator po boys on two separate occasions, and for my first time trying gator I really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Love the catfish and the Cajun chicken salad!!!! The fish is always cooked just right, not burnt or hard and not to soft!"}
{"text":"The last two times I came here was a TOTALLY different experience than the first time I gave rave reviews. The little Amish family that works here need to fired because they are TERRIBLE when they serve you. The food has went down the drain. The fried greens tomatoes have too much breading on them. My dinner came out COLD and the Boudain Balls looked like they had brown vomit on the inside. That salad was good though.... But you can't mess up a salad. The gumbo tasted like the rue was burned more than normal before making gumbo. DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"O.....M.....G This place is AMAZING. We saw it on yelp and with all the incredible reviews we couldn't help but to try it, and I'm so glad we did!!"}
{"text":"Creole/Cajun is harder to come by in PHX but this place gets an A from me as far as authentic NOLA taste.I prefer the etoufee over the gumbo personally because as we know the roux for a great gumbo takes a lot longer and much more effort than most restaurants outside of the south are willing to take and it does matter.Everything else I've had here has been very good.The beignets are very good as well."}
{"text":"Yummers !!!   Reminded me of my time in New Orleans back in my college and military days. The flavors were simply wonderful and they filled a yearning I had for quite some time without going through the expense of traveling back to The Big Easy.   I still can't believe I got the better half to try alligator but she loved it as much as I did !  Good People, Good Choices, and Definitely GOOD FOOD !!!  Recommend and Request you all give them a visit"}
{"text":"First time here, nice service. The food was delicious. My husband really enjoyed his order, he finished all meal and dessert. However, there had a lot of empty tables around and the lighting was too dark, it made me feel uncomfortable to eat."}
{"text":"Meh. If you've eaten at this place and feel a little perplexed at all the 5 & 4 star reviews, you aren't the only one. I had just come back a day prior from a trip to New Orleans and was still craving Louisiana style fare. While in New Orleans, I'd eaten a lot of food. I was meticulous about where I dined and consulted locals for recommendations. I didn't have a bad meal in New Orleans. I didn't even have a slightly subpar meal in New Orleans. It was great. With that in mind, you could perhaps understand why I was disappointed by the food at this restaurant. The bar was set pretty high. I personally found a lot of what was served here to be bland. That said, this place must have so many favorable reviews for a reason, so if you are still curious and you've the money to spare, go ahead and try it. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and it wasn't as though anyone had burned or undercooked anything; the flavors just weren't to my taste. It's a shame this place doesn't have any competitors in the area."}
{"text":"Readers of my review are going to have take it with a large pinch of salt ... just like the food here.  I readily admit to not having tried Cajun before so I'm hardly in a position to make authoritative comments or recommendations, comparing this place to other such restaurants.  There are two important things to know:  1.  Jambalaya, which was once only served on Mondays, is now served every night; 2.  If you're not a fan of fried or smoked foods, this may not be the place for you.  We started out with the fais do do combo appetizer platter.  The onion rings, pickles and tomatoes were good, but all fried.  If you're not used to fried foods or don't like deep fried dishes, you may want to think twice, as they were deep fried with light batter and were VERY greasy (so much so, that when I picked up my unsweetened tea in the mason jar, it almost slipped out of my hand).  And although the pickles are full sours, combined with the fried batter, it was kind of salty.  Now, to once again address the issue of salt, as I've done in other reviews:  we NEVER use salt at home and have a much lower tolerance for salt than most people; so bear that in mind, when I tell you, that we found the jambalaya and gumbo to be pretty salty.  Did I bother to ask them not to add salt, if that were possible?  Of course not!  So, I don't know whether that would've been possible; but at the very least, I can't complain about something I didn't bother asking about.  Portions are large enough for the prices and the gumbo had a huge amount of meat in it; so don't think you're just getting a thick soup  (actually, more watery than thick, but no shortage of meat here!).  Decorations are sparse, so don't come here for the atmosphere.  Service is fast and efficient.  Personally, I can do without the \"Cajun\" music in the background.  Sort of made me feel like I was having dinner on the set of Deliverance.  If you are a fan of Cajun food, I suspect you'll do very well here.  If you're going to experiment like we did, just remember:  1.  Everything -- or practically everything -- is either fried or high in carbs;  2.  Drinking out of the mason jars may be \"cute\", but not easy at times;  3.  The salad that comes with dinner will leave you with the feeling, that, unless its fried, a vegetable is some fancy-shmancy foreign delicacy nowhere to be found in the Deep South;  4. And if you're going to pick up an appetizer, DON'T -- I repeat:  DON'T -- touch any of your clothes, unless you intended to throw them away the next day  (if you insist, WD40 and baking soda will go a long way in removing those annoying grease stains).  Overall, tasty, if not also salty; reasonably priced; different.; but not enough to make me go for a return visit.  Sorry, just not my taste."}
{"text":"True Louisiana cooking!  Staff is helpful and if you have a question about a food they carry they give you a sample.   Dessert is a must and 2 people can easily share 1 plate."}
{"text":"This review is not of the food because after waiting 2 hours I still don't have it. We came as a large group and they didn't even start taking orders for 30 mins. As I am writing this, one of the group asked what was going on after 2 hours, the waitress gave a very rude snippy response so we are leaving without eating. Sorry I can't say anything about the food. Maybe next time but I doubt I will return. We gave them notice of the large group the day before so it was not a surprise."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place and were not impressed. The service was very slow for an almost empty restaurant. I had the Red Beans and Rice Bowl. It was cold and the Cajun sausage in it was very bland. No flavor at all!!!  My boyfriend enjoyed his meal but not enough for us to go back."}
{"text":"Dear review reader: stop reading the review and just go!! But if you still need to know why I say that, here's what you want/should know: Hushpuppies are so darn good, that could had been my meal. Tried the jambalaya, gumbo and a crawfish pie thingy (don't remember the name but it was delicious!). All of it was so dang good. Was it spicy? A little but in a very good way (not too much heat). Topped our meal off with some very yummy beignets. I just can't say enough good about this place! The kids here very happy with their meals and just the overall experience left us all in a very good mood. One last note: THE BEST sweet tea I've had outside of The South. Seriously. THE BEST.  Another last note: the girls working there were so sweet and nice and very attentive. Jenna served us and I tell ya, I want her to be my new best friend, just loved her."}
{"text":"It was okay. I was surprised by how expensive it was. For three people for lunch, with a military discount, it was over $40. I have the alligator po-boy with seafood gumbo and a glass of sweet tea. The sandwich was pretty good, but the gumbo was really watery and mostly salty. My guests weren't particularly impressed. I wanted to like this place, but it didn't live up to my expectations."}
{"text":"Searching for someplace for dinner decided to check Yelp and came across Flavors of Louisiana. It had good ratings so we decided to give it a try. The place was very unassuming, meaning we weren't sure it was actually a sit down restaurant until we walked in. From that point on we enjoyed our meal immensely. The service was excellent and the food was exactly that as well! We tried the chicken and sausage gumbo, Cajun cheese fries, catfish, chicken strips, shrimp creole etc. everything was delicious with the exception of the shrimp gumbo which was a little to fishy for us. All in all, a great meal, great service and we definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in New Orleans.   I do not make this statement lightly:   This is the best Cajun/Louisiana restaurant I've ever been to outside of Louisiana.   Period.   The best. Mrs. Jennifer and her staff get it.  They understand that food from Louisiana is spicy flavorful,  not just spicy spicy. You can not compare Flavors to other \"Cajun\" restaurants.   If you've only been to Papadeaux's or Baby Kay's you will find that the food is different.  That's because Flavors is authentic and the others are not.  You can only compare it to actually authentic Cajun restaurants in South Louisiana.  The restaurant has come such a long way with expansions in the dining room, kitchen and menu offerings.   This Louisiana boy is so happy that Ms. Jennifer chose to share her talents with the world."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Flavors on a whim.  Best whim we have ever had!  And one of the best meals we have had.  The service was awesome, our waitress was very attentive and kept our tea full as well as getting our order to us quickly.  We tried the alligator and crawfish appetizer, Shrimp Etoufee and the catfish.   My husband said the catfish was some of the best catfish he has had.  We left with a banana pudding to go.  Cant wait to eat it!"}
{"text":"My husband has been craving Cajun food and happened to see a little review in the Arizona Republic.  All I can say is that I am happy we tried it out.  We ordered wayyyy too much but YUM!  We had fais do do (appetizers), boudin balls, dunkin catfish, crab landry and will be having the peach cobbler a little later.     The people there were very friendly and customer service seems to be very important to them.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a classic case of Yelp coming thru in the clutch.  I was driving cross country with my family, moving from Cali to Austin.  We stopped for the night at a non descript Best Western motel a tad west of Phoenix.  Everyone is tired, hungry and cranky.  I pulled out my Yelp app so we wouldn't get saddled with some hellish corporate death restaurant, and this place showed up on the fringes of my search.  It was worth the couple mile drive as the food was bomb-tastic.  Even my wife love it!  Staff was friendly and cute to boot.  Nothing fancy here, just big flavor served right at a fair price.  Boom."}
{"text":"As a group of four, we had the seafood gumbo, chicken sausage gumbo, the shrimp ettoffee, jambalaya and coleslaw. All were very good.  Clean restaurant,friendly staff. We'll be back.  Got my eyes on the shrimp po boy."}
{"text":"Haven't had Cajun since I visited New Orleans and this place hit the spot. Not the fanciest decor, but I don't care...as long as the food is good. And it was a great meal! We had the jambalaya, chicken/sausage gumbo, and crab landry. The staff was so welcoming and helping with our questions. Will definitely be back and will save space for the beignets!"}
{"text":"What do you have on a rainy day ok any day--food at Flavors of Louisiana. It's hard to find anything wrong with tonight's dinner other than me not knowing our waiters name cause I was slightly detained.   I loved the Cajun ranch with our 1/2 order of onion rings which were perfectly seasoned and not over fried, fantastic.  Each item we ordered came with a hand crafted salad with your choice of dressing Cajun ranch again best choice. We had the drunkin catfish and red beans, sausage and rice alas no room for dessert so back we will be for some beignets for sure. Last nuggets were that never once did we need to ask to have drinks refilled as they magically were done on their own. Only reason not 5 stars is need a reason 2 comeback and reevaluate."}
{"text":"The Po'boy was OK didn't come dressed like we're used to. But the crawfish etouffee  was very bland and let's not get started on the gumbo which was nothing but a weak brown water with a few pieces of meat. Being from the Gulf Coast if you don't know what its suppose to taste like than you might like this joint and then you're getting Flavors of LA but I urge you to visit NOLA and see what real creole/cajun country is all about."}
{"text":"So delicious!! Make sure you pre-game in the parking lot because there is no alcohol served but it's worth it! We had gumbo, alligator po boy and a crawfish po boy all of which were worth coming back for!! We would come back again on another visit."}
{"text":"Having a friend from Louisiana I have had good authentic Cajun food. I been to every Cajun place to come and go in the Phoenix market. I have to say this is by far the best I have had yet.  Dukin catfish is a must; crawfish pie too rich and deep fried for my taste but good. Hush puppies perfect with the garlic butter; friend green tomatoes what more can I say fried green tomatoes rock!!! and these were no exception.  If you like Cajun it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is always really good.  However,  I got the catfish po'boy and was in love!  The flavor was amazing and much better than my husband's shrimp po'boy. I've craved it more now after trying it and want one at least 1 time a week. I suggest everyone go,  try it and taste good food in the west Valley for themselves.  Support a small business."}
{"text":"So good!! Went there because it's fairly close to my house and was curious. The service was awesome. The food was delicious!! I've never been to Louisiana but I'm sure it tastes just like this. Way better than whatever Popeyes serves. I'm definitely going back to try some more things!"}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much frim the outside. The gumbo is pretty good and the shrimp po'boy is delicious. Atmosphere is nice as well. Server was prompt and knowledgable."}
{"text":"Ok. Where do I start. In the phoenix area, this is my goto spot for cajun food. Simply amazing, is all I can say. The people that cook here, have roots in NOLA, and it shows.  Every time, we've come here, we have had to wait for a table, it is that packed.  We all like it, and when we go see our son in the far west valley, we bring him along for the ride. He loves this place.  I have had several things here, but by far, I keep coming back to the fried catfish with crawfish etouffee on top. Yum. Just can't get enough.  Y'all come get it now, ya hear?"}
{"text":"The food was great, we recently moved from Texas right down the street from Louisiana and when I tell you this is it, this is truly the taste of Louisiana.  If you want good food and good atmosphere this is a great place to start, but I only have one bad thing to say about this place there is only one stall in the ladies room. One person at a time."}
{"text":"I'm not from Louisiana so I'm no expert on Cajun cooking. . .but I know what I like.  I had the 12\" Shrimp Po' Boy.  The roll was soft and chewy, the lettuce and tomato were fresh and the sauce had just a hint of spicy kick to it.  Not enough to overpower the flavor, but just enough to let you know it was there. My wife had the Etouffee which I had a bite of and it was pretty good. The service was fast and the place was full (a good sign!) I'm definitely going back to try the other Po' Boys!"}
{"text":"Yeah your right!! This is my favorite Cajun restaurant outside of Louisiana. Shrimp etouffee, chicken and sausage gumbo, gator Po boy, sweet lemonade and then finishing it off with delicious beignets... COOOOOO!!! Doin' it right at this restaurant. Great service, Great food, great music. If you can't get to Louisiana, then get over to   Flavors of Louisiana in Avondale or Chandler AZ. You will not be disappointed. Guaranteed. C'est bon! Yeah your right!!"}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite place. We were looking for something different and Yelp came through!  I had the Dunkin catfish with shrimp etouffe, the Mrs had the Cajun trio. Both were delicious but that crawfish pie was fantastic! Neither of us had any idea what crawfish pie was but will never forget it. The crust was flaky and the crawfish filling was soooo tasty. It is too bad that it only comes as part of the trio as I am not a lover of jambalaya or gumbo."}
{"text":"I talked my family in to going there for my birthday. I am one of those people who can eat anything with out getting sick. This place did the trick! I was sick for 24 hours. If you take the fryer out of that restaurant they won't be able to cook at all. Even the dinner roll saw the inside of the deep fryer! I so wanted it to be good. Very sad it wasn't!"}
{"text":"Really good gumbo and jambalaya but the price is a little steep otherwise I'd visit more often."}
{"text":"Do your life a favor and just stop what you're doing and get over here and eat some amazing food."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! Went there as a one-off just to try something different. We were fans of Louisiana tastes before, but hadn't had a good place to try that was new. This fit the bill. Staff was great and it's obvious everyone working there has skin in the game when it comes to making it a success. We weren't sure what to order due to all the choices and somehow the manager got wind of this. She came out to personally offer her explanations of the menu items and went as far as to bring us a sample of one of the more exotic dishes' ingredients. We ended up going three-course-meal on this place and by the time we finished we had already made a date for our next visit! Do yourself a favor and get over there. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The PBS show \"Check Please\" brought me to this awesome place.  We average about once a month visit.  I was so full I accidentally left my ATM card there hahaha.  You can't go wrong with the Fried Green Tomatoes, Dunkin Catfish, Catfish Poor Boy....heck it's all good.  The Peach Cobbler is pure awesomeness.   The customer service is always good and they never make you feel rushed even when it's closing time."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because being from the region of Louisiana I expected a little better. The food is not awful, but could be better. Don't get me wrong some of the selections are good ( fried green tomatoes), but other things....had alligator, when available and was okay but have had better. If you're not from area this review may seem harsh, but this is a watered down version of Cajun/Creole food."}
{"text":"Excellent food!! Really good service as well. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and the portion sizes were great!! We really enjoyed the fried green tomatoes and our Po' Boys-- better than what I had last time I was in New Orleans!!"}
{"text":"They have great food. I get the red bean bowl every time it is my favorite! The dining room is quite small..it would be awesome if they got on uber eats!"}
{"text":"Best home style meal ever!  The  krab pocket was perfectly flaky and full of flavor.  Bowl of chicken sausage and rice was moist and delicious.  Hush puppies, green tomatoes and pickles were unbeatable and not to be surpassed.  This is a must check out, totally worth the drive."}
{"text":"You walk in and are greated loud and proud . We started off with gator,  and crayfish.   Then I had the gator po boy (great), and gumbo ( the gumbo was cold)  my  wife had the Crab Landry and loved it.  Now to finish with peach cobbler and ice cream. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! Ordered fried tilapia and red beans and rice! I think they may have given me some catfish instead of tilapia because it was had more of a fishy taste than it should have. Overall, delicious and will be back!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night.  I ordered the crawfish etouffee.  My wife had a chicken salad.  I am a big fan of cajun and creole food and had high hopes for FOL, but my opinion of the food is that it is only average.  The etouffee was a bit bland for me and did not have the rich savory flavor I have had in New Orleans.  My wife felt similarly about her salad.  The restaurant does not have a license to sell beer or wine so it's just soda pop, iced tea or lemonade for drink choices.  Personally, I love a good cold beer with my cajun so that was also disappointing.  Service was very friendly though.  They are very polite and attentive.  I might go back to try the gumbo."}
{"text":"Total waste of my time and money....they caught me in a particularly good mood, it was going to be hard to piss me off today....like really hard. Well congratulations.  First off they have great reviews it seems, and I love alligator. I saw the alligator Po boy pics and I was sold. They open at 11am...took my lunch at 11am...showed up, and the girl said they don't receive their alligator meat until after 12....ok. So I settled for a catfish Po boy, to at least get a preview of how much better it will be once I come back after noon....  I sat for like 20 minutes waiting....while I was waiting some vendor came in, and I heard her telling him they were going to close because it was just her and another guy...who IS NOT A COOK...but a \"prep guy\"....and that is who was actually cooking my food! Wtf!!  Still...I was optimistic...didn't complain or cancel, I waited patiently thinking, the food prep guy is probably better than the cook..  So back to my work I go, still excited to try it...smelled pretty good...open up the box...bread is rock hard...take a bite, and my bread crunches so loud like I was eating chips....people around me are staring at me...friends laughing at me....it crumbled up and I had crumbs exploding everywhere....I think they tried to toast it but I don't know what the hell they did, or if it was just totally stale...not sure....like eating it on a damn cracker. terrible.  And for the price.... I paid like $12 for this crap. So disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was okay, my daughter ordered the gumbo which lacked flavor and very watered down. The rest of our good was great though. Service was extremely lacking though. The waitress didn't really seem to know what she was doing. She had forgotten something with each of our order. My soup was delivered without a spoon and the rest of our orders didn't come with any sauce. Had to call someone over several times. Not sure if we'll be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome. Nobody gets 5 stars. Fried pickles excellent. Shrimp Ettouffe was very good. Thought the Jambalaya was a little dry, but it certainly did not disappoint. My son had the shrimp Creole and he said it was the best. Also Fried Tomatoes were excellent. Really big portions,  had leftovers for breakfast this morning. Suggestion: Some cold Shiner Bochs or Old Dixie Lagers would be wonderful.  No Alcohol at this fine establishment Almost forgot the customer service was excellent and my family says the beignets were \"da bomb\""}
{"text":"Nice casual place! I had the Alligator Po Boy (Great) and for sides, I tried the Cajun Fries (Tasty, but a huge plate), Potato Salad (Good) and Jambalaya (Ok - mostly rice). Lots of other tasty things to try!"}
{"text":"First thing we find out is they are out of alligator and short three waiters! Manager comes out and apologizes three times. All they had to do was give us our appetizers or something simple to chew on while we passed the time, but this idea didn't occur to them. We waited almost an hour and nearly left but they finally brought our food out which was passable but unimpressive.  Manager gave us 20% off our check without being asked and that was nice, but I can't say I'm inclined to go back."}
{"text":"I am NOT familiar w/ what might be considered \"real\" Cajun food.  I had the Cajun Trio meal of jambalaya; sausage & chicken gumbo; and crawfish pie.  The pie could have had less pastry and more meat and fillings.  The jambalaya was primarily a combination of rice and chicken, missing what I was expecting to be a significant amount of red sauce of some kind.  I combined the jambalaya and the gumbo to create a satisfying mélange more closely resembling what I expected jambalaya to be.  The meal was flavorful, not overpowering, and the portions were more than sufficient.  The service was prompt and friendly.  The atmosphere is lacking, unfortunately consistent w/ the strip-mall location (I had hoped for more of a \"Pappadeaux's\"-type feel), but the canned Cajun music (CD I assume) was appropriate and enjoyable.  Overall, not QUITE deserving of 4 stars, but significantly better than 3 stars.  If I ever return to the area, I would eat here again."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite out of town spot for  a good Po Boy sandwich. I had the blacked catfish and it was excellent. It's hard to find some good southern food in AZ. Great food and will sure come back here again."}
{"text":"As someone who grew up eating southern comfort food this place was pretty disappointing. The placed was packed and they appeared understaffed. Walking in the place made me feel like I ws on a future restaurant  impossible  episode.  If you come skip the red beans and rice and the gumbo... you would come out better practicing at home. The catfish and hush puppies were the safest things we ordered.  Overall  this place has a lot of room to grow , just because you have a niche in the desert doesn't mean you can get away with everything."}
{"text":"Yup. Yes. YUM.  Ordered to go and the food was great. I had the fried catfish and gator. The only thing I griped about was the forgotten side of tartar sauce. :(  Wah! But regardless it was delicious. Good portions, too.   We had an order of 5 adults and everyone liked their food. My husband had the gumbo and it was pretty good. When in Avondale, I will have it again."}
{"text":"First time here. We have been looking for more variety than what is available in Surprise. This place has outstanding reviews, which is what brought us here. We ordered three poboys, oyster, shrimp and catfish, and shrimp and oysters. Three sides were onion rings, green tomatoes, and seafood gumbo. They use excellent bread. All the poboys were toasted, fresh tasting seafood, and plenty to eat. The gumbo was over salted, almost inedible. Onion rings were excellent, and tomatoes were tasty but greasy. Not sure what was going on with their iced tea, it was more like water. Overall the poboys get a five. Ice tea gets a zero. Onion rings and tomatoes get a four, and gumbo gets a zero. We will be back for the poboys, and some different sides. We also got beignets, which were very good. Friendly service. Clean restaurant."}
{"text":"one word= wowzer! ok i saw the reviews and was jonesing for some cajun....omg! the catfish is succulent! i had the shrimp po boy its huge! get the smaller one if your to try a little of everything. small but steady flow of business. back to the taste. i had the fries and bf had the shrimp and chicken with dirty rice. one thing i have never encountered... top notch customer service. i watched them customize an order for some army girls, ask us how the food was....insist we refill our drinks...and smile..btw the girl was 9 months pregger and smiling. bomb a$$ place,,,, 5 stars"}
{"text":"The food was delicious & the atmosphere was lively and energetic. We came here for my son's birthday, and it was such a great choice! Everyone we saw that worked there treated guests as if they were individually accountable, like a family run business. There was a live band, and that was mind blowing - it was a really great band, and it was live - in a restaurant that looks like it's half it's size from the outside but goes on and on once in. On the way out someone stopped to see if we came from a private party - guess the vibe the crowd gave off upon receiving this service was one of connectdness! We were asked several times if we were enjoying ourselves by more than one person, and we really are so glad we made the decision to do dinner here. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Coming from a shrimping town, it has been painful for me to see the po' boy catch on as one of the latest trendy re-appropriations for the chic foodies who like to brag about their \"new urban soul food.\"  I'm sure some of it is good, but there is something inherently wrong about $12 po' boy sliders.  Which are served on dinner rolls.  And feature lobster and sausage.  Fortunately, on a trip to the strip-mall labyrinth of the West Valley, I found this amazing, amazing place.  The po' boys are actually po' boys.  They make their own sauce, which is delicious.  Simple, fried seafood with lettuce on a chewy baguette.  I've had the shrimp and the oyster varieties, and both tasted crisp and fresh out of the fryer, and practically exploded in my chomper they were so good.  The potato salad is also creamy and delicious, with the subtle balance of sweetness and vinegar that I think is crucial to a good tater salad.  It's not just a bunch of boiled potatoes mashed up with mayonnaise, or some bulk monstrosity ordered from the grocery store.  It's worth waiting til a Thursday to try this place just to get the crab landry.  Good lord.  Sweet crab stew over delicious garlic bread, topped with four fried shrimp.  The dish doesn't look like anything other than two hunks of bread floating in brown sauce, but it will destroy you in the best possible way.  Best of all, the place is family owned and operated.  The restaurant is simple but not boring - one wall is painted purple and gold in celebration of LSU, and the other walls have a few pictures of other memories of Louisiana - but not in a stupid, kitschy way.  They also serve alligator now.  Worth the trip from Phoenix!  Really!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place! My husband and myself have family in Louisiana and really appreciate authentic food. The food is superior to papadeaux at a fraction of the cost. The servers are also awesome."}
{"text":"You can tell that this place make their food by order so don't expect the for the food to come in 5-10 min, especially during a busy time.   The foods is well worth it as long as you have a buddy to catch up with. I ordered the Joliet Rouge and wow I would come back for it"}
{"text":"I was treated to a birthday lunch by one of my dearest friends and receptionist at Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage up the street.  She recommended it because we're southern girls and like home cookin.  I had the fried catfish strips, red beans and sausage gumbo soup.  It was soooooo good!!!  Just like home!  In fact I liked it so much...we went back again several times with other sales associates from the office.  Loved the fried tomatoes....Yum.  All in all...great food, great people, great family owned restaurant.  Very casual, but good eatin cajun food.  Kudos!!! Would recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Well lets see.  If you like really bad service, I mean REALLY bad service, Dried out fried food, gumbo that is 90 percent broth, you will LOVE this place!!!"}
{"text":"They redid theplace since ive been in. i orderd the gator nuggets and they lacked greatly in flavor. they need to work on their seasoning of food, they are lacking. not as food as papadeaux"}
{"text":"The hush puppies, fried green tomatoes and alligator poboy was amazing.  I will be returning."}
{"text":"This is a delicious place to eat Louisiana style food the service is great the food is delicious and prices are decent I tried the alligator and crawfish appetizer it was great! We also had the Cajun trio the flavors are on point and we also had crab Landry everything was tasty for sure coming back and I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm from Louisiana and found a place for home cooking  Found location to be clean, friendly, affordable and friendly.  When asked for sample of certain items, was provided without hesitation.  I cook at home but there are some dishes that I just prefer not cook and \"Flavors of Louisiana\" is like going to a family members home for a meal.   Thanks for moving so close to me.  I have eaten in and done takeout, always totally satisfied.  Thanks for pampering me."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Unique. Great service. Can be a bit slow at times, so call ahead or set aside the time to eat. A bit pricey but that's because it's unique, not processed junk."}
{"text":"Some of the best fried fish and oysters I've had in a while. A little pricy but good food."}
{"text":"Fried gator, fried pickles, fried green tomatoes, fried okra, hush puppies, chicken strips, sweet tea and to finish it off fucking peach cobbler I have ate myself into a coma, a southern Louisiana coma!  So good!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Cajun food you will find this far west! The food is the real deal! They didn't change a thing to please people in this area, they kept it CAJUN!! I'm from Louisiana and I promise I will stop in on every trip to the west coast!!"}
{"text":"I finally got the opportunity to dine here on a Saturday afternoon...it is not on the beaten path and when I do think about this place it is usually Sunday ( closed).  Anyway...clean, nothing fancy, fantastic service...very attentive.  We tried a variety of things, crawfish pie, crawfish etouffe, fried green tomatoes ,crab Landry, jambalaya, dunkin catfish, red beans and rice, iced tea...the red beans and rice was by far the favorite....great flavor...best I've had.  Fried green tomatoes were really good...all the dishes had lots of crawfish or sausage,etc for the dish except the crab Landry.   The fried shrimp on top were perfect, however, I saw a few shreds of what was probably crab,but 90 percent of the dish appeared to be chopped and sautéed onions...there was a strangely sweet flavor to this...as I have never had this anywhere before I was not sure what to expect....I would definitely keep coming back to try other things on the menu and for the great service...."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times since discovering it. The wait staff is very friendly. The food is delicious and the sweet tea is awesome. I have had the fried Cat fish, the gumbo, and bites of other foods. I totally recommend it to anyone that likes a Louisiana type of food. :)"}
{"text":"The food and service was decent. The waiter forgot our salad and the kitchen got a little backed up. The food is very salty to say the least, but we still enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this on their dessert. Hands down the best cheesecake! It has praline sauce to go with it and it's to die for. I will be stopping by here just for that before I leave arizona, lol."}
{"text":"Tried the dunken catfish and possibly one of the best Cajun dishes I've had. I liked the sausage, chicken gumbo which was perfect to start our meal with. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great freindly service. Very laid back with good music playing. Just come here and try it you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"We went on a weekend night. The service was very slow, it took over an hour for us to receive our food. Once we did the food was cool and lacked flavor. It was a complete waste of money and time. We picked at the dishes and left to get food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time it was fantastic. The last time we went, it took about as long to get our appetizers as you would expect to wait for a meal. Since I have a toddler with a short attention span this was problematic. We were there for close to two hours. The food is great though. I got the Shrimp Creole and It has big juicy shrimp, and way more shrimp than you would expect. Only food item that was disappointing was the fried pickles, they aren't slices, they are big chunks of pickle and I'm not sure why they were soggy so you couldn't really eat them without them falling apart."}
{"text":"One of our favorites for Creole food in the valley! The app Boy is the go to and the gumbo is outstanding!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place, Avondale is a good away drive if you live in the Scottsdale area let along the East Valley but being from Louisiana this is a must, Good staff and friendly and they even have some Louisiana seasoning for sale!!!   I recommend this place to families, couples and even business teams."}
{"text":"Ok, I think I finally found a taste of home without having to prepare it myself!!  The onion rings were extraordinary!  Well, everything was excellent!  Go Tigers and Saints!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great for Cajun food! I'm not a fan of just any catfish, but theirs is outstanding! We try to come here every time we are in Phoenix.  I like to get the Dunkin Catfish. The blackened alligator is also delicious!!"}
{"text":"Food was tasteful.  I had the shrimp pa boy.  It lacked shrimp, so i only ate 3/4 of my 6 inch sandwich.   Flavor was good though and shrimp were cooked excellent.    The rest of my family had the special,  \"chicken fried chicken.\"   It was home made, chicken was tender and freshly made.  It was served with white gravy and mash potatoes.    We shared the beignets, they were perfect.   Not to sweet.  My kids complained it needed a drizzle,  however i thought they were great plane."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Friday night about 7:30pm. It was really busy and they were backed up a little more than usual. We had a fabulous waitress named Ashley who took great care of us and kept us updated on our order. She is a great example of how to provide customer service to keep a longer than expected wait from becoming an a negative experience for the customer.   Food was terrific as usual and the chef came around and spoke to every table and made sure we were happy with our meal.  They have expanded the place again since the last time we were there and they were extremely busy, the whole restaurant was packed. Glad to see them succeeding and even read they are expanding into the east valley.  A great place run by great people."}
{"text":"Absolutely great food, that being said. The service and kitchen are incredibly slow. I have been quite a few times, the service was always slow, they expanded the building and became slower. Food taking 45+ minutes. The ambiance of the location doesn't support 45 minute food times. I still come back though as I really do enjoy the food. Highly recommend the boudan"}
{"text":"We love this place. If you want the traditionals (Gumbo, Red Beans and Rice or Poor Boys) they have it. We just left a restaurant we like to come here and get some beignets. If your into Gator dishes they have that as well."}
{"text":"I've never been to New Orleans so my review is not to compare this restaurant with food I've had elsewhere. This is to say the staff and food at this restaurant is always top notch. I love the Dunkin' Catfish. And the sausage po'boy is delicious. And, if you are ever lucky enough to be there when Mrs Jennifer has made blackberry cobbler, forget the main course and immediately order the cobbler. It is fantastic.  Thank you Flavors for the many wonderful meals. Since moving to the Pacific Northwest I have missed you. It was wonderful to get to enjoy another meal there this weekend and see how busy you are and the changes you have made."}
{"text":"Good Cajun food. Nothing stood out as great or bad, but it is nice to see a Cajun restaurant so far from NOLA that can make good food."}
{"text":"Love the catfish basket with red beans and rice! Super delicious as well as the fried okra, pickles, and green tomatoes. My favorite thing ever is the creole mustard dipping sauce. Everything is super amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The only thing keeping me from giving the place five stars is the price.  It's a hole-in-the-wall little restuarant and the food is awesome but pricey for the quantity and type of food you get.  For example, a cup (not bowl) of chicken gumbo is $6.50 and red beans and rice is $6.25.  I think that's expensive but maybe others disagree.  The two times we've been there though, we were never disappointed.  I especially liked their boudain balls and the hubby liked the homemade chips.    Everything there is pretty much fried or smothered in sauce and if you know cajun, you know the sauce is not desirable for those watching their weight!  It's a family-owned business and we always try to support that.  If only their prices were more reasonable, we would go there more often but as far as the food goes, Flavors will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I have tried the fried pickles, onion rings, fried chicken po-boy and blackened chicken po-boy, which were all amazing. Even the sweet tea was amazing. It wasn't too sweet, It was just right. I can honestly say that the onion rings were the best that I have ever had. The waiting staff are always so nice. Definitely my favorite restaurant on the west side ."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I love cajun food. I was so excited that I got takeout for dinner that night and something for lunch the next day. My optomism was punished. The shrimp etoufee was overcooked shrimp with brown gravy. No spices, no kick, and not etoufee. I was plain. So the next day, I had gumbo for lunch. I couldn't even eat it and had to trash it. Someone had to have dropped the salt shaker in it and decided eh, it will be fine. I have never had anything so salty in my life. The flavor also wasn't there. The huge pieces of sausage were very chewy and rubbery. I was very dissapointed in both meals and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I just can't.  I can't write about the amazing po' boys. The glorious boudin. The succulent fried green tomatoes. I especially can't write about the to-die-for peach cobbler a la mode.  I can't write about it because I can't eat it anymore. I'm a little verklempt, please give me a moment...  Ahem. Okay, that's better.  Try the gumbo if you want to live dangerously, it's spicy! And the crawfish boil is one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten, if also one of the messiest.  Go and eat all of the things. When you do, please have a shrimp po' boy for me.  I'll just be over here, hoping for a miracle drug that allows me to ingest gluten. If that dream ever becomes a reality, Flavors of Louisiana will definitely be my first stop.  UPDATE: I received the following message from the owner:  Hi Beth, Man do i have good news for you. We have a lot of Gluten free items on our menu!!! Yes i was a nurse for 25 years before opening my restaurant and Celiac disease was just becoming a known thing. So we can blacken any of our meats for you with our gluten free blackening seasoning. Also we fry in a mixture of corn meal and corn flour so no wheat flour goes in it. Just ask for your fried foods to be done in the cornmeal mixture instead of the flour. We have french fries, cajun chips, potato salad, cole slaw, dirty rice and red beans are all gluten free. Also if you come on Monday we have our Jambalaya and that is gluten free as well. So come on back and let us feed you some good and i mean real good gluten free food!! Jennifer Goff owner"}
{"text":"The best cajun style food place in Phoenix !!  I love the crawfish po' boy the best, but try any one of their Po' Boiys!!  If you are friends on facebook they let you know when they do a periodic \"craw fish boil\" ..A must try here in the west valley !!!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and the Service and Food was Outstanding,the restaurant has a family feel to it and the staff was very friendly.Our waitress was Jenna and she was on top of everything,drinks,food suggestions and just making sure we were enjoying the experience.We order étouffée and it Tasted just like you would get it in Louisiana,the chicken poboy was delicious and if you add the Louisiana Ranch to it \"Amazing \".My recommendation if you feel like home cook Louisiana food this is the place to come to with great service and real authentic cooking."}
{"text":"Best catfish I've had in a long time. This location has only been open a couple of weeks and we've already been there 4 times. We can't stay away! I had the banana pudding...OMG it was sooooo good!  If you haven't tried Flavors of Louisiana, you're missing out. Good customer service and great food!!!"}
{"text":"Really yummy! Fried Catfish, fried green tomatoes and dirty rice were our favorites! We will be back to try more off the menu. Prices were very fair. Just wish I could have some booze in my strawberry lemonade."}
{"text":"As good as it gets....in the Phoenix area! Granted, this is way out in Avondale but I assure you, it's worth the drive. The atmosphere is nice and comfy, and the servers/hosts make you feel welcome. They play a Cajun/Zydeco in the background which adds a cheery energy, and to which I also had to dance to!   We had a larger group and tried a variety of the dishes (Gumbo, fried pickles, gumbo, crawfish etouffee, po boys, jambalaya) with zero complaints and many happy bellies! I will definitely be going back, despite the long haul. The only complaint I heard was that there was no alcohol, so no beer with dinner."}
{"text":"Based on the yelp reviews my wife and I came here to get away from the conference hotel for some real food. Having grown up in Florida, now living in California and having been to Louisiana many times I was eager to try this place. The crawfish Pie is a classic I've only had in Louisiana but they did it justice. We had a sampling of about half the menu. The fried pickles and green tomatoes were both standout apps. The jambalaya was also pretty amazing. Ya'll go here now, ya here!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service and food. Although I get the same thing every time Basket of chicken with potato salad, the other foods I have tried have been wonderful. I would definitely recommend to my friends and family."}
{"text":"We went back of a long overdue visit, and were surprised to find that they really spruced up the place! They have expanded into the space next door, and dressed it up with bright colors, a fanciful bayou-themed mural, and tablecloths. Yes, there is even now some zydeco to serenade you while you eat.  As always, the food is just as good as I remembered. Maybe even better."}
{"text":"I love this place....they have the best fried green tomatoes I have ever had. Their catfish is amazing."}
{"text":"This place is pretty tasty. Haven't been here in awhile but when I was there, the food and service were pretty good. It felt more fast food-ish than restaurant. Which was kinda weird cause there's alligator on the menu. Lol."}
{"text":"This is a friday night place to be.  Po Boy sandwich with black'n shrimp and seafood gumbo or Dunkin Catfish.  Everything is so good.  They make everything fresh so this is not a place that you can stop and get a quick dinner.  So plan to come and enjoy all of the great food.  Love the desserts too!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place that had flavors like in New Orleans...it did not quite fit the flavor profiles we've been searching for here in AZ. The restaurant did serve good food, had fair pricing, nice and casual dining atmosphere, and good service. We tried the Crawfish & Gator appetizer which was very good lightly coated deep fried bites. I had the Cajun trio - gumbo, jambalaya, and crawfish pie. My husband opted for the 12 oz bowl of chicken and sausage gumbo. My hubby enjoyed the gumbo, but I found it a tad bit salty. The jambalaya was ok, it seemed to be missing a flavor, came lukewarm, and was sort of drier than what I prefer for a jambalaya. The crawfish pie had a great deep fried crust, but the crawfish filling is like their version of crab Rangoon - crawfish mixture with cream cheese? Good but not quite what I expected when I think of for Louisiana style crawfish pie. Maybe the flavors are from a certain region/area in Louisiana I have yet to explore. We ended our meal with their beignets. They were good, but not anything like Cafe du Monde good. We will be back to try other items in the menu, like their etoufé and seafood gumbo. So for now, it gets 3 stars."}
{"text":"Cat fish and hush puppies are delicious and taste different than the competitors. Fried green tomatoes, and red beans and rice are ok. Rolls were cold and hard. Because of the friendly service and affordable prices I can overlook the minor cons. I found my go to place for amazing! cat fish and hush puppies. Oh! and can't forget the good sweet tea."}
{"text":"Very good food and southern style sweet tea! Being from the South I was pleasantly surprised. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Small place tucked next to a Walmart. The food was good and as authentic as you can get in AZ. Worth going back for sure."}
{"text":"Really good food, a nice ambiance and really attentive wait staff. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"FOL has got some of the best fried catfish I've ever had!  It tastes fresh and is always fried to perfection.  I keep wanting to try the shrimp, but I love the catfish so much I order it every time.  I've also tried their red beans and rice, dirty rice, and seafood gumbo.  All are very tasty and the gumbo has a nice dark roux.  Service is always friendly and the place is always clean.  They play non-stop zydeco music, which I must admit is a little mind numbing, but I can definitely deal with that as long as the food is this good.  Im really happy Goodyear/Avondale has a locally owned spot like this.  I love finding the non-chainy establishments with character and awesome food."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood looking for something to eat and with the positive yelp ratings, we decided to try Flavors of Louisiana.   We arrived at 7:40 on a Saturday night and were surprised to realize that it closed at 8pm. In my opinion, that seems a bit early to close on a Saturday night.  The decor was charming with a wood plank-like floor and Burbon Street meets bayou decor. Upon entering, we stepped up to a window and ordered: fried pickle appetizer, I had the chicken and shrimp dinner and the husband had the crawfish po' boy. We also ordered the peach cobbler for dessert.  Now a $6 appetizer seemed a bit steep, but when we received the food, it was enough for 6 people! They were full strips of pickles -- not little picke chips. And they were delicious! I love fried pickles.  I guess when you get down to it, it's all just deliciously spiced fried food, but this was really good! It was not too spicy which is sometimes a problem with Cajun food.all of the accompanying sauces were very flavorful and added a lot to the food. My husband really liked his po' boy as well. Included with each meal is a delicious fried roll. I mean, really. Who knew that southern food had a doughnut equivalent. OK, so it's not a doughnut. it's a deep fried dinner roll -- crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It's a really great invention.  After chowing down on the generous portions, we ended up taking up the peach cobbler and ice cream home. Now maybe it was because we took it home, but I didn't really like the peach cobbler. I expected it to be more peachy and buttery.  My husband ended up eating most of it.  So my nutritionist will kill me when she finds out about this meal, but for a cheat meal, it totally hit the spot. If I am ever back in Goodyear, (which is not very often) I would love to eat here again. We will probably make a trip out there to take my mother-in-law, who LOVES etoufee. We are fans!"}
{"text":"The food was AWESOME!!  I am impressed and I have suggested it MORE than once!! They are very welcoming to the military members.  Didn't get the banana pudding so I am sad about that but I am going back to get some!  Putting the word out!"}
{"text":"I had a shrimp po' boy when I came here and it was delicious! The shrimp was crisp and the bread was fresh.  The only problem was the wait. I had to wait over 20 minutes for a po' boy and a sandwich. Maybe it was because I went on a Friday or maybe it could be contributed to the time went into making it. None the less, waiting for food that long on a to-go order wasn't what I expected.  The owner was very friendly and even offered samples to those who did not know what gumbo.  If you're looking for a fancy Cajun restaurant this is not it. The decor was nothing to brag about. But if you want to impress your family and friends by taking them to a place with good down home cooking then definitely stop by and give them a try!"}
{"text":"Great food and really nice staff. Even though my fiancé and I were incredibly full we couldn't stop eating and finished our plates. Will definitely be bAck soon! It looks like they also do a lot of Togo orders which is nice"}
{"text":"Man came here on a whim was going to go somewhere else but I am happy I dined in today. Customer Service was spectacular from the time we walked in, set down and left. Everyone was very friendly. The general manger came out to greet us who was very nice.   I'm definitely coming back here to have another amazing meal. My girls dined with me and loved every piece of their meals as well. They also have another location in west Phoenix that is excellent. This one happen to be larger in space which is a plus. Thank you Flavors of Louisiana for your hospitality, keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I don't know how it took us 2 years to find this place!  The owner is from Baton Rouge, LA and so is my mother so it was a natural fit!  The restaurant is in the same parking lot as a Wal-Mart...don't be disturbed!  From the outside, this place looks a little sketch... GO IN!  They have everything you need for a New Orleans experience.  The Po Boys are amazing and so are the beignets!  The drinks come in mason jars; what more can I say? very authentic!  It was really busy when we were there so they were giving away free appetizers.  You wouldn't believe that a place like this exists in Avondale AZ so you MUST GO!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Loved the sign on the door that said no sagging unless under the age of 3yr"}
{"text":"Love it!  Ordered the Po' Boy shrimp with a side of potato salad and was so amazed with the entire dish. I would have to say that this is the best Po' Boy I've ever had. The bread was soft and delicious and the shrimp was plenty and fresh.  I really wanted to have the oysters, but they were out of stock *sad face.* Next time I visit, I would like to try the peach cobbler dessert, and I hope they will have the oysters in stock too. So delicious!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time last night. Excellent food and excellent service! I ordered the crab Landry, my kids each had the catfish, and my husband had a combination plate. We also ordered the beignets for dessert. Food was delicious! We will definitely be heading back to this restaurant again. Grateful to have independently owned restaurants like this popping up in our area. They deserve our patronage! Give them a try, you will it be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal! The flavors of Louisiana fits their name. I've never been to Louisiana, but I can imagine what it's like by eating this food. Louisiana's got soul and flavor!   First timer here and got our food To Go, so far I'm impressed with the whole experience. My to go order was placed conveniently and easily, the food was ready within 15 minutes and on my table and devoured in no time flat. I ordered the hush puppies along with the fried tomatoes. Those did not disappoint, recommend those puppies any day. Crispy on the outside soft on the inside. I also recommend putting malt vinegar after you take that first bite...can you say...Mmmmm?? It just soaks up all the yummy goodness and pairs nicely.  Also we order the chicken Po boy along with a Catfish entree. Both were satisfying and Comforting.   I recommend trying this place out. Since I didn't visit the inside of the establishment, I'm not sure what condiments they have for the public. I do recommend Crystal Louisiana Hot Sauce to go with this type of food, it's the Original Louisiana hot sauce and tastes far better than their competitors."}
{"text":"I only stopped once but the place was really good. I got one of the seafood combo platters to go and it was very good.  They have some stiff competition with Angry Crab Shack."}
{"text":"Holy good god, I've had good Cajun food before, but this was a flavor explosion in my mouth! Blackened catfish on top of dirty rice, with red sauce and shrimp. The Joliet Rouge. Soooo good. And the cheesecake with praline sauce?! I've died and gone to foodie heaven.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow what a great little place. Growing up in Louisiana and longing for a shrimp or Po-boy, Flavor of Louisiana you have answered the mail and talk value, you get your monies worth..........."}
{"text":"Third time here, they really knocked it out of the park with their ettouffee and catfish today. So good!"}
{"text":"The staff is great here! Friendly, and they pay attention to details. I used to live in Louisiana, And they get the food right. Big portions - you can have leftovers later too. I'll admit I'm not a big Cajun-seafood person but this is a good place. Most places have the usual chicken strips - but theirs is better, more taste and flavors. I love the hush puppies!"}
{"text":"I would have to say that my husband and I didn't enjoy our experience here, we ordered two po boy sandwiches and two fountain drinks and the total bill was almost $30.00, for that price we could've had a sit down dinner and not fast food creole. As we ate, the server's children ran rampant through the restaurant, and there was discussion about whether she or her mother were going to be working or taking care of the children the following day. Then my husband walked up to the counter to get me a to go container and while he was talking to her, she answers her cell phone and practically ignores him. Terrible service and atmosphere, the po boys were actually good but not worth $10-13 a piece. We thought they had made a mistake on our bill when we saw it was $27.00, that's pricey for fast food sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes but was ultimately disappointed. Let me begin with the pros: Fried pickles Cajun ranch dressing Alligator Poboy Friendly service Cons: Crawfish pie tasted like an oil soaked sponge Meat in the jambalaya was very dry and could use more flavor Seafood gumbo was more broth than anything else however good flavor Fried crawfish was tough  It's over 30 minutes away too so I do not see us going a second time."}
{"text":"Me and my wife walked into this place not sure what to expect great staff very knowledgeable the food was excellent from the dirty rice the catfish, beignets and jambalaya. Great place will definitely come back this place needs to be on the map as a go-to spot!"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, I couldn't wait to try this place out. My fiancé is a huge fan of crawfish and all the pictures looked delicious. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered the dunkin catfish. My only disappointment with this place was the service that i received by my waitress. I don't know whose fault it was, but our food took over 45minutes and people who were seated after us were getting served before us. I understand that the kitchen could have messed up, but the waitress should have notified us / given us an update. For 45mins she didn't come by to our table at all. Anyways, a few minutes later the manager brought our food to the table and apologized, which was a good gesture. In the end, not sure if the experience ruined the taste in our mouths, but didn't really enjoy the meal as much. Maybe ill stop by one day and give it another try, but it won't be for awhile."}
{"text":"The only negative thing I can comment on for FOL is...they are closed on Sundays. Sad face, but I totally understand that. The boudin is excellent and the sausage Po' Boys are my fave! First class service!"}
{"text":"We decided to take a chance and try this place out and we are so glad that we did. Located in a small shopping center the Flavors of Louisiana is a must try.   The place is decorated mainly by a large bayou mural.  As soon as I looked at the menu I immediately wanted the fried green tomatoes. They came out light, crispy and piping hot with a side of cajun sauce. My husband ordered the catfish basket with a side of gumbo which is a premium side that you can upgrade for a dollar more.  I decided to try the oyster po'boy and a side of cajun chips which are homemade chips covered in a dusting of cajun seasoning.  We devoured every last bit.  The catfish was light tender. My husband even got up to use the restroom and made sure to tell me he wasn't done yet so don't let the waitress take my plate yet.  I ordered the 6 inch po'boy and I'm glad I did because I would not be able to finish the 12 inch. The servers are super friendly and attentive. My husband is already planning our next trip back.  Go here now!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service, prices, quality, and FOOD! We had hush puppies to start, best we've had. I had the red beans plate with sausage. Super good! My husband had a chicken po' boy with Cajun chips which he liked a lot. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Food really good flavor excellent atmosphere is ok service is a little slower than I like server is very friendly would come back because my shrimp was excellent there peach cobbler is the best"}
{"text":"The food was actually quite good. However the service was the worst I had ever received. We were ignored for 15 minutes before we even got sat which was crazy. Then our server ignored us for over 15 minutes. We watched someone else get sat after us in the same servers area and she took there drink order, got them drinks and took there food order all before even talking to us. And our waitress was so clueless another waitress came over and asked if we had been helped. She then took our drink order and apologized that the waitress that had that table had been ignoring us.  Finally our waitress noticed us because someone else was helping us. So then in full view of us the waitress who had been ignoring us goes off on the other nice waitress. So the snotty, rude waitress helped us from there and the service just got worse. Later we heard the staff discussing how the manager was not there. Every employee in there appeared to be in high school.  The really good food does not make up for this terrible service..."}
{"text":"Well I have tried almost the whole menu at least once . With out a doubt the best tasting cajun food in Phoenix . I love the cheese cake . The crawfish pies and the shrimp ettoufe . The crab Landry is also an excellent dish . The shrimp are fried to perfection. I am glad it takes me twenty minutes to get here , or I would weigh 200 pounds, but ya gotta check this place out . Prices are reasonable too... The zydeco gives it more of an authentic vibe. And there is plenty of seating ."}
{"text":"Flavors of Louisiana was quite a pleasant surprise. The food is very authentic, which is a huge plus! The hush puppies were delicious and the service was average. Overall, I give it 3 stars because the service could have been a little better, but the food was the best around if you want some authentic Louisiana flavors. Going back to try their Gator soon."}
{"text":"Fried shrimp and onion rings , red beans and rice.   The very best  ever.   Bryan was the server who helped us order the right thing and was very accommodating and knowledgeable  Eat here you will love"}
{"text":"I really like the food but it is way over salted!  The apps, fish, rice, broth...everything has too much salt. We only eat there once in awhile so we don't have to go on blood pressure meds, lol. But seriously,  it's good. Service can be slow if they are busy."}
{"text":"This place was just added to our list of favorites. My husband wanted to give it a 6 star rating if we could! From start to finish the service and food was top notch. So flavorful and such good options. A lot of food and the servers are so kind. Everything was homemade, but even better! The icing on the cake was the cheesecake with praline sauce. Just a decadent dessert. I am looking forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  Highly recommend ordering the trio.  Crawfish pie us AMAZING!!!!  Everyone in the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"We've had a yearly family tradition to have a Cajun dinner on Christmas Eve Eve since we moved here 20 years ago. Needless to say, the choices have varied over the years but wow did we hit a home run tonight! There's something for everyone and the flavors are spot on. Omg the beignets!!!! We look forward to coming back - especially when we can enjoy a beer with this fabulous food and atmosphere (the owner said very soon!) Clean restaurant with attentive, friendly staff. I highly recommend you check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Food here is excellent, my favorite is the shrimp po boy. If you like good southern food, this is the place to go! I have eaten here many times over the last few years, and have NO complaints!!!"}
{"text":"WOW! So this is what it must be like to eat at a little place by the bayou like in TRUE BLOOD, except that we have to settle for a small locale in a strip mall. Nevertheless, its all about the delicious food here.  I had the Poyboy with Shrimp and Fries and KA-CHING, I totally got my money's worth when the delicious french bread toasted to perfection entered my starving mouth. I of course, added some hot sauce and lime to the sandwich which only made it much more tasty and spicy.   I would have to add that thebreaded shrimp was the highlight of my visit to this place, it was thick, big  and meaty and was seasoned adequately. I only wish the restaurant were bigger so we wouldnt have to hear the patrons conversations in such close quarters.   Damn, just thinking about my pleasurable moment at FOL I am starting to crave another one of them PoBoys."}
{"text":"Have had the jambalaya, chicken and sausage gumbo red beans and rice, beignets, banana pudding and peach cobbler.  Really enjoyed the gumbo and jambalaya.  Very tasty with some kick bit not too much and very tender meats.  Both say they have vegetables but did not really notice any...Jambalaya portion a tad skimpy when compared to an order of Chinese fried rice which may be a weird comparison but only sausage and seasonings seem to make it real different.  Gumbo was real good.  The 3 desserts results surprised me.  Thought I would like in this order beignets, banana pudding, peach cobbler.  (Btw, Not a fan of peach cobbler)  however IMO, 1st was the peach cobbler then the banana pudding and not super impressed with the beignets.  Will definitely be back.  Think the gumbo will be better in the cooler months as warm comfort food.  Staff always friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Flavors of Louisiana, but it certainly won't be my last.   When I walked in, I was a bit confused because there was no one behind the counter at that moment and I missed the big and very obvious sign that said to order at the counter. So I waited a couple minutes until a young man appeared at the counter and asked if I'd been helped. I said no, and said \"one for lunch please.\" He kinda stared at me for a moment, then he realized I didn't understand the process. He explained they don't have servers until after 4 p.m.  My bad! Only including it here so you don't have the same thing happen!  I ordered the drunken catfish - two nice sized strips of breaded, fried catfish on top of etouffee. It comes with crawfish, but I asked for shrimp instead and they substituted, no extra charge. It was all on a bed of white rice, and served with two pieces of garlic toast.  I also had a mason jar of very good sweet tea.  They bring the food to your table when it's ready. The wait was long enough to convince me they cooked everything fresh (the taste proved that also) but no longer than that, which was nice.  The decor is okay. I felt the chairs in the dining room were uncomfortable, but everything was in good shape and everything I saw was clean.  The food was outstanding! The catfish was as good as any I've had anywhere. Fried food that's not greasy is hard to do, and it's a rarity, but they obviously have it all figured out. The catfish was flavorful and flaky, and the breading was just right. The shrimp was very flavorful - you know how sometimes you order shrimp in a meal, and there's just not much of a flavor to it? Well, I don't know if that's because it's not fresh, or it's how it's handled, or it's where they get it from, but I do know the shrimp here was delicious and it's the kind of shrimp that makes me keep ordering shrimp!  The etouffee was also delicious, and the bread was a nice touch. I had considered ordering hush puppies, but glad I didn't because it would have been a little too much food, and I'm a big eater.  I wasn't sure how to go about getting a drink refill (refills are free, according to the menu). Shortly after my food came out, the girl behind the counter came into the dining area with two pitchers of tea (I assume one sweet, one unsweet) and refilled the glasses of 3 guys at another table, saw mine was still half full and did not stop at my table. I had hoped she'd come back, but she didn't so I guess I was supposed to take my glass to the counter and ask for a refill. That's about the only thing I didn't enjoy about this experience.  Ordering and paying at the counter in advance has its advantages - when you're done eating, you don't have to wait for a check, you can just get up and leave.   All in all, I truly enjoyed my lunch today and I've already told my co-workers in the office that we should plan a group trip there soon. The person who does our food orders looked them up and is already interested in having them cater our next event."}
{"text":"I GOT SICK!!!  I've lived in Louisiana and love great Cajun cuisine, however \"flavors of Louisiana\" gave the worst tummy aches I ever had. The items I ordered was the crab landry, and hush puppies. Not sure if the base wasn't cooked enough, with the tiny pieces of shellfish, and the sauce, possible bacteria growth. I've been sick for almost 2 days since, very painful.   Not sure if I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a really nice family owned restaurant that is located on the far West side of town. It is definitely worth the drive. Good friend from Louisiana told me about this place and her food. So I got in my car and had to check them out right away.  Inside is very casual with a vibe that reminds me a eating in one of those smaller towns down south. Decor is very simple with touches of the bayou and it's critters sprinkled here and there. The smell of the food instantly puts me right into the zone.  Really love the Cajun Food and the Cool Cajun Zydeco music playing playing in the back ground. They have both a lunch menu and a larger dinner menu. You can order off the dinner menu at lunch if you are really hungry. The portions are bigger and there are more choices.  So far we have tried the Dunkin Catfish, the Alligator and Crawfish Po-Boys and both of the Gumbos. How can you go wrong with Catfish placed on top of rice and then covered with Crawfish Etouffee. We also tried the fried Green Tomatoes on our last visit.  The food is cooked and seasoned with tender loving care. Everything taste fresh and the prices are very affordable. You can always add some extra heat by choosing one of the hot sauces to kick things up a notch.  Service is friendly and helpful. This is not a well polished chain restaurant with robots reading scripted dribble. Just great food with a fun and tasty menu.  Use your GPS if you are coming from way across town. They are located in a large shopping center towards the back and the sign is a little hard to see from the street. PARTY IN MY MOUTH!  4.5 STARS"}
{"text":"Really good place for delicious Louisiana food. We always get the po boys whether it be shrimp or cat fish and the fried pickles are amazing too ! Everything you get here is pretty much delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow. Even Lafayette, LA born Hubby was seriously impressed with Flavors of Louisiana. The restaurant was far from full on a Saturday night, but the customers came in steadily. It is a small place, but very clean, and rather sparsely decorated. At least you can taste right away where their priorities are.   Hubby had the special of the night- three pieces of tender, perfectly cooked catfish smothered in crawfish etoufee. He had asked for, and was told that he would receive etoufee only, but got the special anyway. He loved it, but this mix-up is the reason for the 4 stars. Even though it was in a darker roux, which he normally does not prefer, he licked his plate clean. I got the shrimp po'boy which came in a large basket with fries. It was two 6\" halves of a fresh baguette with lettuce, tomato, a zippy sauce, and plenty of perfectly cooked battered and fried shrimp. Our dining companions had an equally huge and tasty fried oyster po'boy, a side of fresh and tangy cole slaw, and a bowl of delicious seafood gumbo. Nothing was spicy, just super flavorful. The boys got the peach cobbler dessert, and even though we girls both said we didn't much care for peach cobbler, we certainly helped the boys polish off the big bowls when they got to the table.   Even though FOL is quite a drive for us, we will be back very soon. Please note that as of October 1, 2009, they will be closing early on Saturday nights- 8:00 instead of 9:00 PM."}
{"text":"An amazing place to eat. I lived in the south for about 6 months, so when i first went here and heard accents, and obvious displaced southern folk, i knew this place was gonna be good. Everything i have eaten here is delicious, and the staff are incredibly friendly. Do yourself a favor and check this place out. and if you feel bad you can go burn off what you ate at LA fitness next door"}
{"text":"Excellent crawfish etouffee and boudin balls. This is a welcomed addition to West Chandler. We were there on the first night of opening and the service was excellent for opening night. Will definitely return soon to try out the other menu items."}
{"text":"If you have a craving for cajun food, this is the place! Clean, and friendly. The food is NOT greasy and so delicious. Iced tea is good and so is the lemonade. You walk right up to the counter, place your order,pay and sit at the table where they bring out the food. Oh yes, is isn't noisy either. I was very impressed."}
{"text":"This place was an excellent first visit! Seafood was delicious and crisp. I got the alligator po boy, which was delicious, and the bread was both crisp and help really well-didn't have to deal with a sandwich falling apart. Friend of mine got the cod po boy and the fish was delicious. Definitely going to come back."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food offered at this café. Are they setting is very modest and casual, the food is very good. I started with a mixed appetizer of onion rings, fried green tomatoes, and fried pickles. All were top notch with a spicy but flaky batter. My entree was the beans with rice. The portion was large and was very tasty.  My only turnoff was the Bible quote on the message board as I entered.  I prefer my meal without preaching."}
{"text":"Tried this locally family owned restaurant for the first time, and I gotta tell you guys not only was it amazing but their staff was extremely nice. The kids try to help out, and they're just simply adorable (I love it!!!). Since it was our first time here and I looked into the reviews before ordering anything I highly recommend the po-boys :-) mmm mmm simply scrumptious !!# My bf got the gator po-boy, potatoe salad, and chicken sausage gumbo ( yes he definitely pigged out :-)) he had to take some to go. I ordered the shrimp po-boy and since I'm a Latin lady lol and I do love my spices I had to add some Louisiana hot sauce on that baby ...boy I'll tell you it was like heaven on earth Just like Arnold Schwarzenegger said (ok I think I got his last name spelled correct) lol I'LL BE BACK with an accent lol....sorry I'm just being silly...ok anyways guys, 5 stars to this little hidden gem in the west valley...by the L.A.fitness"}
{"text":"Went for dinner, my bill was around $70. When I received my food noticed I was missing the hush puppies.  I went back to be approached by a lady who asked me \"mam what do you need.\" A better way would have been \"how can I help you?\" I told her about my missing item and she pulled up my order and said they didnt charge me for it. The young lady who took my order looked like she felt bad, mistakes happen. Okay, I paid for them and had to wait 10 - 15 minutes for them.  Got home in Buckeye, food was cold, fries soggy. Hush puppies that killed the rest of my order not so great. Gave two stars because fish was ok. Won't go back."}
{"text":"A true hidden gem! This place is amazing! I had the dunkin catfish which was to die for...my husband had the shrimp po boy which was delicious as well! I can't wait to head back and try more dishes! Oh and don't skip out on the peach cobbler. It's the best I've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Best Beignets in Arizona! My son, daughter and I had a wonderful time at Flavors of Lousiana yesterday.   Ambiance: Mural style decor echoed dining in a shack by a bayou. Zydeco music was playing and diners were transported to Louisiana.  Cajun Fries with Bacon: Delicious thick spiral fries excellently fried, generous amount of cheese (mozzarella and cheddar blend) melted over the fries, topped with delicious bacon and sprinkled with Cajun seasoning. My mouth is watering just remembering the taste.  Cajun Ranch: Thick and creamy with a little kick. We enjoyed this with our Fai Do Do: Pick 3 Appetizer Sampler: Double Order of hushpuppies and fried pickles. The hushpuppies are crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. They were of generous size and are served with butter. I liked them, but there is one place with a more seasoned batter. My daughter enjoyed the fried pickles, but we agreed that they were too wet and the batter did not adhere to the long pickle slices as well. The Fai Do Do also comes with a dijon mustard based remoulade that was as popular as the Cajun Ranch dip.  BEIGNETs!!!! Served right with honey......mmmmmmmm so good. We all agree that we could come here just for the Beignets! I miss my beignets from Cafe Du Monde, but these were really nice sized fried dough, topped generously with powdered sugar, and honey, don't forget the honey. Such decadence!  Sausage, Red Beans and Rice: Andouille sausage pieces with red beans and rice. The red beans were nicely seasoned. I was impressed that the sausage was crispy and had a nice chew to it. Texturriffic!  Dunkin' Catfish with Crawfish Etouffee: Perfectly seasoned and fried catfish with creamy crawfish etouffee. The crawfish could have had a more al dente bite. The etoufee was on the spicy side, but almost as tasty as my favorite restaurant in Louisana. I am just grateful that I can take care of my Louisiana cravings here in the West Valley!  Seasoned bread: The Dunkin' Catfish and the Red Beans and Rice came with delicious buttered and seasoned bread.  Friendly Service: Our server was amazing! She happily refilled our water, brought more Cajun Ranch and brought us sturdy plastic containers for our leftovers. Sometimes, there was a little wait in the kitchen for our food to cook, but the food is worth the wait. You cannot rush the love in cooking.  We will be back for Cajun Fries, Cajun Ranch, Beignets and next time, I am ordering fried fish and gumbo! If you want to go exotic, try the gator."}
{"text":"THANK GOD!!! I have finally found a REAL Cajun place here in the big AZ. It is a bit of a drive for me but at least I can get my fix of real Cajun food when I need it.     So far I have tried the Boudin balls, the red beans and rice, the oyster Po-boy, the catfish, the dirty rice, the shrimp creole, the deep fried shrimp, the seafood gumbo and the peach cobbler. EVERYTHING was excellent except the peach cobbler. But I will admit I am not a peach cobbler fan to begin with. The bread they use for the Po-boys is fantastic. Very good flavor and nice and soft but not to soft to be mushy by the second bite. There shrimp is some of the best I have ever had. Light as can be with a fantastic flavor. The service was great as well. The two sisters that run the place were very nice and helpful.      I recommend giving this place a try, I know you wont regret it. I would  eat here more often but its 26 miles one way. One of the sisters did mention they are going to be opening another place just like this by Arrowhead mall in about a year. This is good and bad. Good that I can get my Cajun fix much more often. Bad because I may end up weighing 400lbs in a month. This food is just damn good."}
{"text":"Very good food. Cute dining area made to look like your sitting on a porch near the bayou while listening to Cajun music. Service was great as well, answered all our questions and was very polite. We will come back!"}
{"text":"Either you will totally get it or you won't. Flavors of Louisiana was very very good. The food is authentic and hits the mark. I totally get it. The thing that you just can't put your finger on that many restaurants will never have but Flavors of Louisiana does is this. (This may sound negative but it is a complete positive in EVERY way).  The staff has the look!!! The clientele has the look!!! What is the look? If you have ever been to New Orleans you know it is a pretty nasty place. It is dirty, it smells, the people are nasty and in general look unkempt. I would definitely NOT say they were nasty at all BUT slightly unkempt, and a little grungy ( not dirty). I LOVED IT !!!! It screamed New Orleans. The clientele had the look overall. Hard to explain...but clearly evident. Well Done Flavors of Louisiana."}
{"text":"My wife had the gumbo and liked it.  I had the jambalaya and it was just okay; the chicken was rather chewy and rice had cooled off some.  Service was good and fast; atmosphere was pleasant.  Will give them another chance."}
{"text":"I have to say this place has really upgraded since the last time I ate here! .The food had a good change to it  better flavor and portion size. I had the combination plate with fried tilapia, fried boudin balls with rice and beans. It was quite delicious and enough to bring home and shard with my hubby (who also gave a thumbs up and he IS from NOLA) Kudos!!!"}
{"text":"My husband's family grew up in Louisiana so they know Cajun food. We've been here several times and have never been disappointed. I try something different every time and love it all. Beneighs for dessert are definitely the highlight of every meal."}
{"text":"My husband is a cajun boy from Louisiana and I (after living there for 7 years) know what cajun and creole food is supposed to taste like.   We were both excited to try this place after hearing good things about it.  All of our food was good but the fried green tomatoes and especially the gumbo were knocked out of the park.  Spot on taste of Louisiana.  The gumbo had the perfect smoky flavor it's supposed to have.  So good! If you haven't tried this place you need to."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas close to the Louisiana border and this is authentic Cajun food....the shrimp po'boy was outstanding. It was seasoned to perfection. The beignets were out of this world. Some of the best food I have tasted since I moved to Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"Bummer! First time I gave 5 stars! This time Seafood gumbo was mostly broth and rice. 5 shrimp in a 12 oz bowl. No other seafood. Forgot my dipping sauce for the catfish and only three small strips. Consistency is so important!  New place so someone needs to be on top of quality control."}
{"text":"I am only giving these guys 4 stars because I don't really have much to compare to. I have never had a Po-Boy before I had it from Flavors of Louisiana, but I absolutely LOVE them now. I got the Chicken Po-boy and everything from the bread to the sauce to the chicken is great! Oh and fried green tomatoes are THE BEST! OH Oh ohhhhh, don't forget to get some sweet tea too! I love this place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I took my friend who was raised on Louisiana cooking, his father is from Baton Rouge and he didn't want to leave. He ordered the alligator po'boy and it was great.  The bread is light and filing while the tartar sauce was a wonderful compliment to the breaded gator.  So we could sample the menu we shared each other's plates.  I ordered the Dunkin catfish with crayfish etouffe.  It was spectacular, the etouffe was almost buttery it was so smooth, the catfish was breaded like a pillowcase, firm yet comfortable on the fish. Can't speak highly enough about this great place."}
{"text":"A nice surprise in the West Valley tucked away in a shopping area that generates a moderate amount of traffic. FOL provides that much needed change from the regular food spots you find typical suburbia. Walking in you immediately get that country slash home cooking joint feel. Plenty of seating and surprisingly never overflowing with customers but you'll never find this place empty. Menu immediately opens your eyes to a variety of the not so typical choices and you'll notice you begin to smile reading items that remind you of home cooking. You'll want to get a bit of everything since it appears that because of pricing, the portions may be small but surprisingly they give you the right size portions for whatever you're ordering. Staff is cool and is keen to ask if you're a first timer. They'll shoot you a tip or two but don't get caught up on ordering the same thing because you got immediately hooked on something. And you will be back since your belly really approved of this home style cooked meal which is not normally found outside of going visit family. Service isn't lightning fast but it's forgiving when you finally get that first bite. If you're gonna try and dine in, sit back, relax, and pretend you're at home. Get yourself in the mood."}
{"text":"I walked in for the first time today, due to the large Yellow and Black Sign hanging behind their building visible from I-10 that reads CAJUN FOOD! I was greeted by a very friendly waitress / hostess at the counter. Now this place is a mom and pop place run by  what seemed to me to be hard working folks as well. The place was pretty crowded and I could tell that this wasn't your typical chain or fast food joint in the area. I was in for a real treat! You will be as well if you go. Ordered a crawfish PO- Boy and a cup of the most outstanding full flavored Gumbo I have ever tried. Yes I have even been to the Big Easy. This by far was outstanding. So was the PO-boy( dressed the way it should be). My food came up in a timely manner considering they where fairly busy. While the young lady behind the counter took my order, there was a boy about 7 or 8 helping fill drink orders. He was a very polite little boy and so willing to help clean tables and general chores to get the place looking spotless. You won't find this in the chains that surround them. This boy was hardworking as well and willing to help as much as he could. Never in my life have I ever walked into a restaurant that was leading by example. I would only imagine how the employees are treated by the owners  because the service and the food was top notch. I certainly will visit more often."}
{"text":"I used to live in Beaumont, TX which is about 30 minutes from LA. As a result, I would eat killer cajun food. Since I moved from there I haven't had anything as good UNTIL I came to Flavors of LA! U gotta have the boudin balls but have them roll them in cornmeal instead of flour. The catfish is great and the red beans and rice to die for!!!! Enjoy"}
{"text":"We have always found the fried shrimp and French fries to be spectacular, and I enjoy the red beans and rice. The only problem we have had is that they are so popular, it's hard to get anyone on the phone to place an order. But we've been getting takeout from them for years and have never been disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"Even though I don't eat most of what they serve(picky eater) what I did have was really good. The people I went with had a huge sampler and loved it all too.  Great customer service too.  Oh and the beignets...... oh my.  Save like half of your dinner and take that home to save room for the beignets. They're like little pieces of heaven in your mouth."}
{"text":"Hot and fresh! The catfish is clean and plump, fried to perfection. Great fried shrimp and dirty rice. Lemonade is tart and sweet. Sweet tea is just right. Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Flavors of Louisiana is home to the most delicious and authentic food of Louisville. From crawfish pie to Shrimp Po Boy, you certainly have a smorgasbords of deliciousness to tame the beast we call hunger. The establishment has such a homie feel to it, when you come in you feel right at home. Pop a chair, sip on some thirst quenching sweet tea, and chow down on true authentic flavors. You will not regret coming here."}
{"text":"Been a while since we've been back here as we decided to let our sodium levels drop back to normal. Certainly worth the wait.  Shrimp Po Boy was outstanding!"}
{"text":"This was an amazing meal. The service made me feel at home. It is self service so you seat yourself take your time go up and order then they bring it out when it's done. Everyone was nice. It is clean and it smells good. The food is delicious. The catfish...seafood gumbo, gotta get me a take home serving of gumbo. Add to my list of favorites!"}
{"text":"I'm here right now on Good Friday 2018 and the staff is running around like headless chickens. They need to get organized and the host is having a crying fit and they need to hire way more people!!"}
{"text":"Best food I have had outside of Louisiana. I took my mom here on her last visit. That was all she wanted the next two days she was here."}
{"text":"This place is way tasty!!!  I ordered the shrimp Po Boy and some Jambalaya.  I wasn't aware the sandwich came with a side order of your choice.....I got the red beans and rice...   The bread the sandwich comes on is so fluffy and fresh, the shrimp are crusted with panko I believe.  The shrimp and fixings are super fresh tasting too.  I will definitely be coming back.  I gave a 4 stars out of 5 just because I was craving a Muffaletta and it wasn't even on the menu, and also for them being closed on a Sunday.  I drove a distance and didn't know that they would be closed on a Sunday, so I was a little upset about that.  But set that aside and the staff was friendly and the food top notch.  Try it out it's good stuff."}
{"text":"Very good service, and the food was very tasty. The catfish and shrimp was excellent. Dine on!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! My friend had the catfish, I had a bite.. and that's definitely what I will eat the next time I go! The peach cobbler was sooo delicious! This place had a nice dinner crowd on a Monday night so I can imagine that it must be crazy busy on the weekend!"}
{"text":"undoubtly  the best cajun food out side of louisianna.catfish was breaded properly and not overcooked .gator was excellent.gumbo was gastronomic. not a single item served was not in the stratosphere.I have found a place to enjoy the cuisine. the staff lends to the ambience.     between espos and flavor ,it is all u needddddd!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just got back from lunch there and I have to say it was very good.  I agree about stop reading the reviews as I did and just go there!    We ordered the fried green tomatoes and hushpuppies first.  They were nice and crispy but not greasy from being fried.  The hushpuppies were delicious and tasted even better with a little butter.  Next my wife got the fried catfish combo with coleslaw.  Again the fried catfish was not greasy and crispy cornmeal batter.  The catfish was a little softer than what my wife would have liked but still tasted good.  The coleslaw was great as well, I had a taste of it and it was crunchy but not soggy from all the mayo.  I forgot the name of what I had but it's one of the specials they used to have only on Wednesdays and it's like the Dunkin Catfish but the catfish is blacked and over a bead of dirty rice.  Then its covered in shrimp/crawfish etouffee, it was very tasty and I literally had every bite with either catfish/shrimp/crawfish with the rice!  They were not shy with the seafood.    Over the service was great and friendly.  We will definitely go back!  I've been to Pappadeaux and this is a great alternative especially on your wallet."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try something new and local. I have never had Cajun so asked the waitress for her suggestion. She let me taste test the creole which was delicious. My husband got the ettoufee which was just as good. We loved it and plan on coming back often."}
{"text":"Very clean, and very friendly service. Hubby had their jambalaya from their gluten-free menu. He said it was UH-MAZE-ING! (and it was, I tried it). I completely enjoyed the Shrimp Po Boy w/fries and didn't share ...fantastico!! The sweet ice tea...refreshing and fabulous. To top off our bellies, we shared a sinfully perfect, and delicious slice of cheesecake w/warm praline sauce...did I mention hubby is VERY picky about where he eats?...yeah, he's looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"First, know that I was born and raised in New Orleans and know better than to expect much from remote places claiming to prepare authentic creole food.  Being in the desert of Arizona (business trip), I was predicting the gumbo to be tomato soup with hot dogs floating in it. The place didn't look like much from the outside (or the inside) but being a brave and noble soul I charged ahead and ordered the fried green tomatoes, fried pickles, a cup of gumbo and a shrimp Po-boy.   I can't believe how good it was! They might make the best fried pickles I've ever had. The gumbo was delicious...well, everything was delicious. But be warned, I ate too much and almost fell asleep at the table. Great food."}
{"text":"Ordered their shrimp po-boy it was great. The flavors are amazing. Also had their potato salad for my side and that was incredible. I would go back if I lived in town! Would definitely recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"we just ate Flavors of Louisiana and it is  awesome Jambalaya and Muffaletta was killer worth the drive from anywhere in Arizona very reasonable prices and great service and Sheila our waitress was sweet and we topped if off with BlackBerry cobbler!"}
{"text":"Great little Cajun restaurant tucked back from the street. I haven't met an entree I didn't like in there and I've tried quite a bit of the menu! Love the dirty rice and gumbo."}
{"text":"Food was the best Cajun food out side of my dads home town of New Orleans. Aneas, was great and very helpful! The cook was 5 star as well! Can't say enough"}
{"text":"This is a cute new place (opened Dec. 2017). It is sparsely decorated like a lot of places in Louisiana (but much cleaner). The staff was friendly. I ordered a fried oyster po-boy with cheese fries ($15). The sandwich was solid--they didn't skimp on the oysters and they were fried well. The bread was also good though perhaps not quite crusty enough to stand up to the wetness of the filling. The remoulade sauce wasn't quite right, but it was okay. The fries were good--thick cut smothered in shredded cheddar and bacon. I think the last po-boy I had was at Mother's. This place didn't live up to that, but it was okay given we're in Arizona."}
{"text":"Staple for Friday nights! Crispy catfish can't be beat in these parts. Love it with fries and red beans/rice. Great service. Not too bad on the pocketbook either!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy going to Flavors of Louisiana. It is a very pleasant place to go to. The service is always very attentive, very nice, and clean. We love that they have daily specials, but also, on Mondays our kids eat free, with a paid entreé, what is there not to love. We are a family that enjoys eating, and going out to eat, and this kinds of deals are what we look for, plus, he food is great! We usually get the Po'Boys, me the shrimp, my husband gets either the crawfish or the alligator, when he feels brave enough. I've also had the Chicken and Gumbo dish, with dirty rice and a side of Potato Salad, spicy and delicious! They boys used to get the corn dogs, but have discovered that their catfish is delicious... I have to confess that when they can't finish their dishes, I don't mind at all helping them out with the tasty catfish. All of these with regular French Fries, or Cajun Chips, both are really good. I really do recommend this place! You have got to go!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Very attentive staff.  Great Louisiana feel inside. Cajun music playing in the background. The hush puppies and garlic butter were on point.  My husband enjoyed the seafood gumbo.  Lots of amazing flavors in the is dish.  Kids shrimp meal was great.  My son loved it. I'm not sure they have anything that would not be worth it. Overall very pleased."}
{"text":"Stopped here because we love seafood and cajun food. And I can't say enough great things about this place.  To start with the ladies at the counter are extremely sweet welcoming and friendly, overall look of the restaurant is great! We came in on a very hot day and it was nice and cool great sweet tea and strawberry lemonade. I tried the crawfish etoufee and my boyfriend had the crawfish po boy. We were so amazed with the amazing taste and freshness of the food! If you live in the area and even if you don't make it a point to come out to this restaurant it's definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"The beignets tasted like they were not only greasy but tasted like they were fried in old oil! That was my first experience, my second experience was when I went in for peanut brittle and my checking account got charged twice for the bill, they did reimburse me right there because I wasn't gonna wait till after the weekend like they wanted so they could check the bank why, I did have my bank statement which helped"}
{"text":"I was the first customer in today when they opened. I was about to order what I thought was too much food at too much money, when I saw the lunch specials on the back page. So - for under $10, I got to try the gumbo AND a po boy!  I opted for the catfish po boy, gladly accepted the side or Louisiana Hot Sauce (I am out at home!) and took the food home with me. I was very impressed with the po boy - fish was hot, crisp and moist - bread was perfect - lettuce and tomato fresh as can be!  I honestly couldn't tell if it was dressed with mayo or remoulade (guessing it was a combo of the two...not enough flavor to be remoulade, too much for mayo) - but once I put some Red Spot on it, the sauce didn't matter too much, anyway. That filled me up, so the gumbo was eaten out of the fridge a few hours later.  The chicken pieces were big and moist, the andouille was sliced thin and the overall flavor was so smokey perfect I was sad to only have a small cup of it! When I first was taught to make gumbo, I heard you need to either use okra OR file.  (A powder made from sassafras.)  I generally use both - but the lack of okra didn't detract from the perfect balance this gumbo was! A coworker commented to me several weeks ago the gumbo was too \"soupy.\"  Not sure what his gripe was here...every bowl of gumbo I enjoyed in NOLA was just this texture. Happily, my sister lives nearby - so now that I have been, I will be back again and again!  (Note to Miss Jennifer - I will be in on Saturday to enjoy a beignet!  I hope the coffee is with chickory!)"}
{"text":"I was in town on business and decided to check Yelp for dining advice. I'm staying in Avondale and did not feel like taking on the insane traffic on I-10 again so I went for local. I saw several restaurants within a few miles of the hotel and some had great reviews, but with only a few reviewers. When I found A taste of Louisiana, the rating was 4.5 stars with 621 reviewers. Those are numbers I could trust. I was glad to be seated right away and ordered a cup of gumbo to start then blackened snapper with crawfish topping! Wow. I grew up on the gulf coast of Mississippi just a few miles east of NewOrleans and know good seafood! I was certainly not disappointed. The portions were generous and I have no idea how they sell this much seafood with authentic Cajun flair for less than $25.00 I will be back to eat here again soon."}
{"text":"It is the first time I ever left a new restaurant very happy and not too full, but perfect for my stomach. The atmosphere was great and the server there was phenomenal. The wait for the food was a little long, but trust me, it's so worth the wait. I had the crab Landry and my guy had the shrimp creole. First time eating here and first time had a different kind of food and man. I gotta say this place its small but the food it good. That's all I have to say. Give this place a try, if you want to try something new :)"}
{"text":"Good environment. Friendly and quick service. We ordered fried pickles and crab Landry, both were made well and tasted good. The reason for the 3 stars was because I was looking forward to trying the jambalaya so I ordered that for myself. It was a complete let down. It literally tasted like someone poured a bottle of liquid smoke into the dish. Aside from the overwhelming smoke taste, the rice was mushy and the sausage was burnt. I won't be getting that again. However, I am willing to give them another try but I will stick to a po' boy instead."}
{"text":"All the food is delicious here. Jambalaya all day! Will continue to go back. The menu is well priced with a hearty helping."}
{"text":"We went thre for lunch,  it was not too busy.  Husband and I both ordered catfish, I had red beans and rice and he had gumbo.  I liked the catfish but did not care for the red beans and rice.  I tried my husbands gumbo, did not like it either.  But thats just me cause he seemed to like it.  Im not sure we will go  back as it is a bit pricey.  They had NO sweet tea and the unsweetened tasted awful so opted for soda.   I have never had a muffeletta and want to try one, dont see a review here for that.  Oh and with no one there, the service was VERY slow, waited forever for food, was freezing in the dininig area.  Eating out of strofoam is never my idea of eating out either.  Well have been back twice since, the muffeletta was delicious, the bread was outstanding. I only order the catfish and fries as that seems to always be delicious and my favourite,  it grows on you and when you want hot catfish this is the place to go.  Service was better this time.  Husband has been there twice without me for a gator poorboy but so far they have been out.   Oh and the tea was fresh and tasted good these last two times.   He likes the gumbo,  I do not."}
{"text":"Great service with great food! The environment was nice and comforting and the wait was more than reasonable. I'd recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"A quick PSA for those of you who call yourselves foodies.  If you haven't already been, you must put a visit to New Orleans on your foodie bucket list.  There's simply no other city I've been to where food so perfectly marries so many different cultural influences.  And I'm not just talking about the touristy French Quarter.  The Garden District, Freret, Central City, Uptown Carrollton and even around the swamps north of Lake Ponchartrain have some amazing food spots to choose from.  I could spend a lifetime taking in the New Orleans food scene (it would likely reduce my lifespan by a couple decades too, but that's a conversation for another day).  In the three days I spent in New Orleans last summer I was in culinary heaven, but finding a place in the valley that could truly replicate it is no small feat.    The west valley has a largely deserved reputation for being chain land.  You'll find clusters of solid mom and pop shops in parts of Glendale, Peoria, and Surprise.  But let's be honest, its mostly chains.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, but the further west you go, the harder it can be to find truly unique locally based spots.  Which brings me to Avondale, an area of town I rarely stop in but often pass through.  Nestled a stones throw north of the I-10 freeway just east of Dysart, Flavors of Louisiana sits unassumingly among all the big box stores and chain restaurants.  Flavors has been on my Yelp radar for awhile, but my skepticism (and the long drive from my apartment) kept me at bay.  It turns out however that Flavors really does have roots in the bayou as Louisiana native Jennifer Goff opened this place in 2008 on a mission to show the valley just how great truly pure cajun country food can be.  So on a Friday lunch run, it was time to dive in.  As I walked in the door, I was greeted warmly by the woman at the front register who allowed me to take my time looking over the menu.  Here you order up front and you grab any seat you'd like.  The atmosphere is super relaxed with upbeat Louisiana jazz music playing in the background, LSU Tigers gear on the wall and seating for I'd guess 60 or so.  I wanted to get something resembling a sampler that would fill me up for lunch without taking things too far.  The Cajun Trio looked like the perfect compromise.  Jambalaya and gumbo (because of course), and something called crawfish pie.  Now I've been to a New Orleans crawfish boil before (which should also be on your bucket list), but I've not had crawfish pie.  Total cost for the trio as well as a water (drinks here are served in jars btw) including tax came to $15.  After just over 5 minutes, the trio was brought to my table.  Boy oh boy did this smell fantastic.  The aromatics of the spices alone had my mouth watering (though admittedly also tepid with concern that it might be a little too spicy).  Let's begin with that gumbo.  I went with the chicken & sausage gumbo instead of the seafood gumbo per the woman's suggestion.  Big hunks of both meats in a slightly spicy, but bountifully flavorful broth and some rice to boot.  Excellent gumbo all around.  How about the jambalaya?  Rice, chicken, veggies, and sausage with plenty of Cajun seasoning.  Again, just enough spice to open up your nasal passages, but not so hot that it takes away from the dance party in your mouth.  Now let's get to that crawfish pie.  Picture that perfectly warm flaky buttery dessert pie crust you love.  But instead of apples, or cherries or rhubarb, you instead stuff said pie crust with loads of crawfish meat, garlic, veggies, and cajun seasoning and then top it with some creole mustard.  This dish is phenomenal.  Probably the best rendition of a pie turnover that I've ever had.  And you don't have to go through the laborious process of peeling off all that crawfish meat yourself like you would at a boil.    Perfect flavors, perfect portions, perfect meal.  What a find, what an unexpected pleasure.  Native Louisiana residents can of course feel free to judge for themselves whether this truly matches the food they remember back home, but based on my experience a year ago, this is as authentic as I've found anywhere in Arizona.  All brought to you by a fantastically talented woman from Louisiana, bringing a mom and pop destination to an area of town that could use many more like her's."}
{"text":"Catfish is good but tooo salty. Cocktail sauce is too salty as well. Nice ambience. Will try it again .."}
{"text":"I heard many wonderful things about this place so I decided to give them a try. They are in a hidden plaza and if you blink you will miss them. Just look for the LA Fitness building, they will be in the same parking lot area. I went in there and ordered my food to go. The gentleman at the cashier was very helpful with his recommendations and his knowledge of the menu. After a few minutes of contemplation I decided on the Shrimp Po Boy with potato salad. The salad was mediocre at best. I am used to my potato salad with plenty mayo, little mustard, eggs, celery, black olives, pepper and a hint of salt. The potato salad I had was very bland with very little flavor or ingredients. The Po Boy made up for it though. It had some good flavor. The sauce they had in it tasted great and the bun was fresh. The only issue I had was the price. It was 20 bucks for a footlong Po Boy and the potato salad side. Other than that, it was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"First, I am biased. A co-workers wife owns the place.  BUT. Wholly crap I ate to much. We finally went after a year in Goodyear and my wife and I both had poboys. We will be back and I will stop here.  Hopefully my opinion won't change over time, but I think this place is now officially on the GOODyear list."}
{"text":"Great food, and great customer service! I enjoy coming here. I love the dunken catfish!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner around 7:30 on a Saturday night.  Restaurant was very quiet. The food is amazing, and the staff was nice and attentive. The flavors are very authentic.  Had fried green tomatoes, shrimp etoufee, red beans and rice, fried catfish - all excellent. Took one star off for not serving beer. Seriously?  No Abita to go with these Cajun classics?  The waitress told us that they have more of a lunch crowd, so they don't have a big demand for alcohol. That's just a shame.  Would definitely eat here again, or maybe do take out."}
{"text":"my boyfriend and I stopped by for an early dinner and there are zero complaints about this location.  It's a small shop, family-owned and the food was amazing (as long as you like cajun-style food).  My boyfriend is a huge fan of cajun food, spent a lot of time in New Orleans and loved the authenticity of FOL.  I am not nearly as familiar with cajun food and tried the fried pickles and alligator combo.  I loved it.  The helping was GENEROUS and definitely enough for leftovers.  The restaurant is going to be opening a second location in Phoenix and it should definitely be visited."}
{"text":"Born & bred Cajun girl here.  This joint is a 30 minute drive for me, and it's worth it.  The music, the atmosphere, the staff--very much like going home. My partner swears by the chicken and andouille gumbo.  I'm a pescetarian, so I have to take her word for it.  The catfish poboy was fantastic, though I'd stay away from the seafood gumbo.  It was kind of muddy tasting the first time I went.  You can get things like fried alligator here, which is really fun.  And the beignets are excellent.  Overall, it's a great little place if you want to experience a little bit of Louisiana in the Valley."}
{"text":"Being from south Texas myself (close to Louisiana) I had major doubts this little Avondale strip mall joint would be able to produce anything close to authentic Louisiana fare.. I was however pleasantly surprised :) their shrimp poor boy with French fries was amazing and the fried catfish with cole slaw was close to home cooking!! I have been back on my lunch break several times and the food is always consistent and fresh and delicious every time.. Service is friendly and fast too which is a bonus!! Go ahead and check it out you won't be dissapointed plus they serve alligator if anyone is interested in crossing that off your food bucket list!!!"}
{"text":"Expensive!! And all you get is average-tasting creole food with none of the punch I associate with the south.  For the price, I could have had a sit-down meal with wine and non-styrofoam plates/utensils.  Reccomend passing on this one."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go here again. Had the shrimp po-boy and some homemade banana pudding. I'll write more as I try different things on the menu, but what I did have was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Family owned diamond in the rough. I always get the shrimp po boy and the potato salad. Here is a protip: put TONS of the their Cajun seasoning on the potato salad. Oh man. So good.   The wait isn't bad at all, keep in mind people, this isn't fast food. They make EVERYTHING fresh. Nearly everything is made in house.   It's always a pleasure coming here."}
{"text":"Really want to rate them higher... but just can't.  First visit  was during dinner service and I had the seafood gumbo and shrimp po boy.  The gumbo was excellent with the dark broth I'm accustomed to but served with very little rice.  Po boy was good but as another reviewer pointed out, very sparse on the shrimp.  Service was good.   Second visit I stopped in for lunch and ordered a half crawfish po boy, Cajun chips and a tea at the counter.  Service was good but at $17 and change felt I was taken for a ride.   The sandwich, while good, was again skimpy on the meat and the Cajun chips were nothing special.  Not a very good value at all but I'll try again.  Third visit was another dinner service and I ordered the dunking catfish.   It came out just lukewarm and I tried to enjoy it but it quickly became cold.   Flavor was good but I was only able to eat half of it before bringing it to the waitress' attention and she was apologetic, comped us desert and asked us to try their establishment again, which was nice.   I'll be back at some point, but unfortunately the lack of value and the hit or miss food and service will not allow this to be a regular spot for this Po boy.   Really a shame because it's so close and I love Cajun food!"}
{"text":"Wow, amazing place! It was our first time here and we loved everything. Great customer service, the food was delicious. I got Etouffee and my wife got chicken strips with fries and Cajun chips. We could taste the freshness of the food and the balance in spices.  We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Mouthwatering with great service! I'm not from The South, but I love some Cajun food! I had to have their Fried Green Tomatoes, their Crab Landry and Etouffee. There was so much more on the menu that I wanted to try. Portion sizes were great, service was a bit slow, but it was busy, so I'll give it a break. The food was outstanding! I will be back many more times.  The only thing I found disappointing... it had been here 5+ years, and I never knew about it!!!"}
{"text":"We discovered them last month using an Entertainment book coupon. The food was so good we had their trio combo of crawfish pie, jambalia, and seafood gumbo and the crab Landry, served over garlic bread,  we would order over rice next time. Both were very good however. Today we had the shrimp po-boy and lunch sized jambalaya . Beignets covered in powdered sugar with real honey. So glad this restaurant's here."}
{"text":"Having never had Louisiana food I found this place to be incredibly interesting and delicious... I imagine it's not great for your weight but the flavor is unreal. We had a young man wait on us who was very awkward but did a great job. I really enjoyed the food here"}
{"text":"Sooo Good. Shrimp Po' Boy is my fav, but everything is worth the price and the drive."}
{"text":"I'm generally very picky about southern food and trust me I rarely give ANYONE 5 stars but this place is the total package! Well minus the fact that they have no alcohol but the food was AMAZING, the waitstaff was great, food came out quick and we used a restaurant.com gift card so it was cheap! Only suggestions I would have are to get that liquor license ASAP and start serving some hurricanes pronto! Also maybe better advertising. From the street view I didn't realize what restaurant it was but may attract more people with better marketing. Overall thumbs all the way up!"}
{"text":"Absolutely recommended! Food was delicious and service felt like that good ole southern hospitality! Catfish was very good, my sister had the Po boy the only problem is she wanted more! Seafood gumbo was to die for! Wonderful place"}
{"text":"Located adjacent from Wall-Mart. Order at the counter. Servers will deliver food to the table. Must have: Drunken Catfish, Po-Boys, and Peach Cobbler. Also good are the Gumbo, Banana Pudding, Beignets, and Gator."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!  Stopped in yesterday and had the alligator and gumbo with jambalaya and it was excellent! The alligator was golden and crispy yet so tender as they only cook the very best and most tender part of the gator which is the tail. The gumbo is to die for and the staff is friendly and warm. The restaurant is clean, spacious and festive. If you've ever been to Louisiana you'll see that this restaurant is as close as you get to the southern flavor hence the reason I'm back here the very next day!"}
{"text":"This was interesting. Came here specifically to try the alligator for Mothers Day.  Prices ok... not ridiculous.   Cheap down home tables. Didn't expect anything else.   Easy dress code.   Alligator is cool. Tastes pretty yummy.  Can order your items blackened. But you can order the fried stuff with corn instead of wheat! Very useful.  Owner is fully aware of celiacs and gluten intolerance due to having been a nurse. Can do low sodium and vegetarian as well! I was so pleased with that."}
{"text":"I have no clue what good Cajun food is b/c I quite literally have never had authentic style Cajun food (I am not counting that Zatarans rice in the box either).  But, after reading the reviews for it on Yelp, I HAD to try it!    Although I was way too chicken to try the crawfish or the alligator, I did go for some shrimp.  It was fried in this very crispy and light batter with a really tasty seasoning.  I decided on dirty rice as my side.  Dirty rice (I had to ask) is cooked with some pork and beans as well as some strong and flavorful seasonings.    Flavors of Louisiana is a small place, but was packed when we walked in after seeing a movie early in the evening.  There was a large family and several couples eating in and waiting to take their food out...a very good sign in my opinion!    If you are in the same situation as me and have no clue about Cajun food...here's what I learned while waiting for my food and reading the educational bit on their menu:   Authentic Cajun food is actually not spicy as many say, it is actually flavorful, slow cooked, made with love, and full of mouth-watering seasonings.  Interesting.    FOL is family owned and operated and they are incredibly friendly.  While we were there the owner came out from the kitchen to hug and greet what seemed to be either family friends and/or regular customers two different times.  One couple walked by us on their way out after eating and told us, \"This place sure could make someone fat.\"  I overhead more than one family tell the owner how they will most definitely be coming back and how amazed they were at how delicious everything was.    I'm not sure if I'll go back only b/c I really have no clue about Cajun style food and what it entails.  But, the shrimp and dirty rice I had were very good and I would have it again if I was in the neighborhood!  Oh, and I almost forgot, the dipping sauce for the shrimp made me want to lick the cup clean after using it for my shrimp...I'm not even sure what the seasonings in it were, but who cares, it was yummy!"}
{"text":"What a great little find. The service was very friendly. The food was delicious. We had several items. The shrimp po'boy was very close to any you would find in New Orleans.  The gumbo was the best, we had both. The smoked chicken they use really made a difference. Red beans and rice is one of those items I use to judge a Cajun restaurant- these were creamy not runny and very flavorful. Soooo good  Worth looking for this cool little spot."}
{"text":"The food was great! The prices were very reasonable. The service was good. Only think is that the dining area is very dark, I adjusted eventually."}
{"text":"My friends took us here when we moved in, sort of an introduction to the area and wow this was the authentic stuff you want to eat, they live up to the name.  Catfish, jambalaya, wonderful sauces and things you would expect the bayou to serve up fresh like they do here.  I felt that funky mojo soul thang power-up inside me and you know it's good cookin when you get that goin' on. And the tea, have the tea. Oh yes."}
{"text":"Amazing! This is one of the best places to eat ANYWHERE!!!  The staff is always friendly and the food is AWESOME! I always get blackened alligator, dirty rice, fried green tomatoes and Cajun fries, and the sweet tea is refreshing! This is a meal I dream about."}
{"text":"WOW what a FUN, interesting, tasty little gem in the Southwest Valley!  Our party of 4 gorged ourselves on fais do do (appetizer sample platter), shrimp etoufee, po boys and combination platters suited to fit even the most simple of palettes. I will tell you--as a healthy eater, this place does not offer many options for lower fat/lower calorie meals so use this as a 'cheat' spot. It'll be worth it. Loved the shrimp etoufee with dirty rice. It was perfectly done.   The place itself is a bit divey looking, but don't let the looks deceive you. It's super clean.  The food is really good. The service was friendly and competent. Drinks are served in mason jars which keeps things nice and COLD.   Definitely worth the drive from NorthWest Valley. :)"}
{"text":"AVONDALE location Ok, the food was cold, service was bad, no drink refills on tea and it took one hour to get our food after it was ordered. According to the waitress they were short staffed. Not good management as people were just leaving because of the waits. Tables were not bussed and that was gross. I was given a 20% discount card but I will not go back.  HOWEVER...We will go back to the Chandler location, it was superb."}
{"text":"Was happy to find this place one Saturday afternoon.  I had the Dunkin Catfish and fried boudin balls. Both were delicious. I'm gonna go back and try more of their items. If you like Cajun food try this place. I was pleased with the portions, price and the taste."}
{"text":"I stop by and get gumbo or chowder to-go from this place for lunch once / week. Recently waited over 15 minutes .. which is strange because the 2 things I ordered (seafood gumbo and banana pudding) should already be prepared. Just put it in a container and I'm on my way. Usually out of there in 3-4 minutes. Not kidding. I go after the rush so I know they aren't too busy. But Friday my experience was not good. I don't know how they dropped the ball but I finally asked what the hold-up was on my gumbo. The person I spoke to at the register was gone in the back for more than 5 minutes. So now I have waited over 20 minutes for something that has never even noticed taken 5 minutes on previous occasions. When she came out, she had my order and said it was the banana pudding that had been holding everything up. So I don't understand how that could be but if someone is expected to wait 20 minutes for gumbo and dessert, I wish they had told me there was something going on with the pudding and I could have skipped it. In any case, the food is absolutely wonderful - the closest you're going to get to anything resembling the delicious Flavors you love from Louisiana around here. So I am sure I will continue with my lunch obsession and be here again next week .. I just needed to vent."}
{"text":"I thought the catfish was a bit overpriced but it was a pretty good meal. I would have the liked the service to be a little better. I would repeat :)"}
{"text":"Finally we've found deeelish Louisiana cooking, outside of the South. Everything we had was good, but the Sausage/chicken gumbo and the fried catfish were my favorites. More menu items to try, we will be back."}
{"text":"Best authentic Louisiana food, especially here in Arizona. Never pass by this place without stopping. It's that good. My personal favorite is the shrimp po boy with extra sauce. Woo Wee"}
{"text":"This is a meal worth every penny! The Shrimp Po Boy is the best I've ever had. Lots of shrimp in every bite and the remoulade sauce is amazing! You know it's good when you repeat the same four words after every bite, \"this is SO GOOD!\""}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the Avondale for the Nascar events this weekend and wanted to eat before hitting the road yesterday.  I found this place on Yelp and we decided to give it a try.  We were both very happy with our decision.  I had a fried shrimp Po'Boy with Red Beans & Rice and he had the Jambalaya.  The shrimp in the Po'Boy had a light batter and was very fresh and the dressing had a nice flavor to it.  The bread was toasted and perfect.  The jambalaya had both chicken and sausage (huge chunks) and a distinct smoky flavor.  He said he was getting it from the rice, I felt it may have been more from the sausage or the chicken.  Either way, VERY good. We will definitely return the next time we are in town and plan to take friends and family as well.  It was a great family run restaurant and we wish them a Happy 5 year anniversary on November 18th!"}
{"text":"Return visit for me but brought a friend this time for our Foodie Friday visit. We split items so we can try different dishes. Red beans and rice, jambalaya, Joliet rouge, dunkin catfish, fried pickles, fried green tomatoes, hush puppies and ended with beignets. Everything was so good and delicious except the jambalaya seemed to be lacking in flavor. Felt like something was missing. Other than that everything was really delicious. The beignets were heavenly!"}
{"text":"I've been to Louisiana and this is as close as it gets. The service was wonderful even at 2 p.m. in the afternoon. Nice selection of Louisiana dishes. My little sister had the shrimp poorboy, she gave me a nibble and I was like \"OH MA GAWD, BECKY!\" The bread, she told me is from Louisiana and it rocked my socks. I got the catfish and it was delightful though I only took a few bites off the plate, I was satisfied completely.  Why you may ask, only a few bites? I just got done dress shopping and let me tell you, if that isn't depressing.  Basically, don't come here if you're watching your figure, it's a very temping menu.  Our server was delightful and we were greeted by what seems to be a manager while we were dining. For sure went out of their way for us, so I tipped 25% on the bill.  If you're in the area, give them a try, especially if you're craving Louisiana dishes or don't want to fit into a dress.  Props Flavors, mad PROPS!"}
{"text":"Going to give a 4 star rating on this restaurant as the service and the food were really good. The restaurant itself was okay, and the prices were high! Went for dinner with my daughter. Since it was our first time in we wanted to try a lot of things. 2 non-alcohol drinks (tea), 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 2 desserts was $88 without tip. Wow! Okay so the apps we got the crawfish and alligator fried was nicely done. Breading was not heavy and good flavor. Trio of fried food included the pickles, green tomatoes and hush puppies also very good! Probably the best fried pickles around. The breading was light and nice spice profile. The dipping sauces were pretty standard. I ordered the crab stew with fried shrimp which was a little on the sweet side for me but the shrimp were large in size so we'll put together. Daughter ordered the crawfish étouffée which was decent. Lots of crawfish but didn't enjoy the rice with it. Maybe need a different type of rice or some butter in the rice but not sure what it was. Not sure if order that again as it is a favorite of ours just didn't taste quite right. Dessert was beignets and sadly disappointed. Basically was just buttermilk Biscuits deep fried with powder sugar. They were really heavy and not like the fluffy puffs of amazing you'd find in NOLA. All in all the place has good food. We'll be back to try the gumbo, jambalaya and crawfish pie. As far as the ambiance of the place was empty, felt really large and almost banquetish. I hope they are able to bring in more people to keep the place open as there's not many authentic Cajun places here in the valle"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. ...The food is delicious felt like I was down south..so happy I leave a minute away!!"}
{"text":"Five stars all around! The food was outstanding. Staff was super friendly. But wow! I ordered the Cajun Trio which consisted of jambalaya, seafood gumbo, and a crawfish pie. The cheesecake with praline syrup, oh my goodness! Everything was AMAZING! I'll definitely be recommending this place to everyone I know. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Gumbo was very good and worth going just for that. The catfish and shrimp were very good and my wife got the etouffee and said it was very good and reminiscent of places we've gone to when we lived in Houston.   Would love to see shrimp and cheddar grits :)  Will have to try the red beans and rice next time.   Thank you for being so close to where I live :)"}
{"text":"I appreciate their offerings for gluten free diets. What a relief to feel like they get it and won't hugely cross contaminate, also to feel like you aren't imposing to ask for such accomodations.  Dining out since having to go strictly gluten free has lost its allure but is a pleasure and treat again at Flavors of Louisiana. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Even better than last time. The crab Landry is outstanding- sweet, smokey pepper bite to it. Authentic fried shrimp is plump and perfect. Gumbo almost as good as my grandma's. Service has gotten faster. Prices are more than fair. Gotta say, the chef really knows what he's doing. Genuine, authentic Cajun food."}
{"text":"Believe every last bit of the hype in these comments because this place is excellent! We loved everything about it. From the service to the food. We started off with the Cajun cheese fries as our appetizer. They were sliced potato wedges piled with cheese, bacon, and green onions. We ordered the Cajun Trio and the Red Bean Bowl. Each entree comes with a salad and garlic bread. The crawfish pie that comes with the Cajun trio was my favorite! Everything was delicious. They don't skimp on the portions here either."}
{"text":"The search is over.  Finally real Cajun food outside of Louisiana.  Need more stars.  Had the Jumbalaya...Seafood Gumbo... Crawfish Pie and of course Hush Puppies.  Some of the best anywhere.  Flavors of Louisiana is one of my new favorite restaurants anywhere. Got to come back and eat my way through this menu.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Got the oyster Po-Boy & rice and beans side & my husband got the shrimp Po-Boy and seafood gumbo side.  Yummy and tasted authentic.  Take note that the Po-Boy is HUGE and could be eaten by 2 people, especially if you each order sides.  I felt that after eating 3/4 of the oyster Po-Boy, I got a bit sick of it because it wasn't balanced by something more light.  I was craving a piece of fruit or something to lighten up my palatte so I could finish the Po-Boy.  I could've been happy with just half the Po-Boy."}
{"text":"We were a little bit skeptical that an authentic Cajun style restaurant like this would crop up in the West Valley. But here it was.  It was a weekday evening, and the place was packed. And the only table we could be seated upon was the one by the front door nearest the cashier and kitchen.  At first, we thought this was a bad location. Being at the main thoroughfare of activity, and having to look at everyone at the entrance as we ate. However, it worked out to our favor because we really did get the best service. Why? Because the waitresses always had to pass by us on their way to serving everyone else. What a Bonus!  In any case, my wife had the Jambalaya, and I had the Combination plate of Catfish and Alligator strips. My wife was quite impressed with her food. I tasted it, and it was a little bit too tame for my particular palate. I've been to Louisiana many times, and the food there is a little bit on the spicier side. But, I just added some hot sauce, and I got it to my liking.  The Catfish that I had was excellent, but the Alligator was a little undercooked. Alligator meat is tough enough as it is, so it takes a little longer to soften its texture. Now, what I did like about the Alligator strips that they had was that it was devoid of the nasty after taste that I normally have experienced with this type of meat. They probably were more thorough in their marinating process. In any case, all our meals were quite tasty!  For good measure, my wife wanted to try the Beignets. These are deep fried doughs, topped with powdered sugar. It was fresh, moist, and hot. Absolutely wonderful.  I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewers on this take. It was worth the drive, and the food was delicious.  I must comment on the service though, especially seeing as how crowded this place was. We were very fortunate to have great service because of our table's location, but they need more help here as there were too many people waiting in the lobby for tables, and there were plenty of empty tables, but they needed to be cleaned. And we could see all the frustration written in the faces of the people that kept peeking at the empty tables, wondering why they weren't being seated yet.  In the long run, that may backfire on them.   But overall, this place is a hit. The food is excellent, and the family that runs this are the nicest and friendliest of people!"}
{"text":"I wish they had cayenne pepper with the black pepper on the tables cause they make their food for Yankees & I need more heat. But it's good authentic food, just too Mellow. I don't like adding hot sauce cause it makes to too much vinegar taste.   I got jumbilia it has lots of meat in it. Love the tea. Fries are boughten crinkle cut, but palatable. You can actually get whole crawdads on certain days. It's great for a change every so often.. & its close to sprouts."}
{"text":"Eating here for a third time now.  Great food and service.  The seafood is all fresh ( You can get Tilapia, Shrimp or Catfish blackened or fried).  We've tried Po Boys, Catfish, Crab Landry and Gumbo and nothing here we didn't like.  The fried pickles, fried green tomatoes and hush puppies are all too die for.  None of the fried foods are greasy, but light and crisp.  Ambience is casual and service is very attentive. Prices aren't cheap, but good value for your dollar with dinner entrees about $14 on average. Lunch menu available till 4PM daily. If you like home cooked food, this is the place."}
{"text":"SO DISSAPOINTED AND DISATISFIED! I ordered the seafood gumbo 12oz order because I was a bit hungry as well as 1/2 order of fried green tomatoes and sweet tea. The gumbo was just a bowl of broth with a minimal bottom layer of white rice and a few floating shrimp, the shrimp was not over cooked but the rest of the tiny bits of seafood where extremely over cooked and the broth tasted like a dash of seasoning with an over bearing amount of salt I could not even eat it the broth I fished the shrimp out the only edible thing! I got 5 fried tomatoes at over $1 each they were all breading, you couldn't even taste the tomatoes inside and they were dripping with grease! $20 meal thrown away and I was still hungry afterwards!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing ! Spectacular! Best southern cooking I have tasted by far ! Flavors of Louisiana gets five stars!"}
{"text":"I was heading back to Tucson from visiting California. Nearing Phoenix, I found I had a mean craving for catfish, and decided to turn to Yelp for a recommendation.   The restaurant is convenient located not far off the highway in a strip mall (characteristic of Phoenix). From the outside, it doesn't seem like much to Yelp about. Uninteresting facade overlooking an open parking lot. Inside, it is more lively, and busy! Good sign, I thought.   I had phoned in my order, which was ready in about five minutes. Nice cordial staff.   I opted for the catfish basket. Sizable portion of fish! These folks are generous. Sadly, though, the fries were a bit lukewarm. But the catfish was quite good. There is something in the seasoning that is unlike the catfish from back home. I think it may be cayenne. Not sure. Gave it an interesting tang. And the biscuit that came along -- just decadent.   Great find."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  The food is about as real to Cajun I've ever had.  We are in town from Texas and this is a MUST try!  The staff are extremely friendly and attentive.  What an amazing find!  The 4.5 stars it is currently rated is spot on!  I had the catfish with crawfish sauce!  Wow!  Give this place a try!  You won't disappointed!"}
{"text":"Brought my fiancé after fasting all morning...she ordered the shrimp po' boy and I did the sausage po' boy with hush puppies and side of jambalaya. Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"So everybody I know keeps talking about how great this place is, and after experiencing it myself, I cannot disagree more.   We wet there on a Tuesday night, and the place was very crowded. There were only two employees working there with a restaurant full of people. It took about 20 minutes to place our order, and about 30 minutes for the server to bring it to the table.   The food is served on styrofoam plates, and it was so hot I could not enjoy it. It seems that the put it in the microwave and served it from there. Once it cool off, the food did not have any flavor at all. I did not finish my dinner, and none of my companions had a pleasant experience with their food either.   I was expecting an out of this world experience but unfortunately, i was very disapointed."}
{"text":"Good food, everyone who works here is extremely nice. Support the troops. I suggest Duncan catfish, which is a lunch special everyday now! The peach cobble crust is infused with vanilla and love. But if by some chance they have the crawfish corn bisque... U will believe God created the earth and heaven to put this in your mouth. Not five stars for price and they do not spice it up as you would think they would (probably because of the local population)"}
{"text":"Laid back,cool music and a hell of an authentic chef obviously.  We started with a cup of gumbo, awesome!!!My huband got the po boy shrimp sandwhich , awesome!  I got the dunkin catfish , delicious! My daughter got chicken strips and said this here favorite restaurant , that works . Price was very reasonable and Carlee are waitress was very knowladgable and quick , thanks guys!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean and friendly place to eat. Sat us quickly. Food is very tasty and well served."}
{"text":"A lot of our friends have recommend this place, so we thought we would give it a try.   Loved the signs they had hung up. Brownie points.   This place is way too dark for my liking. I had a hard time seeing the menus and the chairs are chairs that I have when I throw parties.   I am not a seafood eater at all. Just my preference but the hubby is one ocean eating fool.   The food was pretty good, hubby loved it a lot more than I did. I believe if they let some light in and got better chairs it could be an even better place.   For now, it will only be a go to place if the hubby drags me."}
{"text":"Everything was sooooo good! We had the Drunkin Catfish and the red bean bowl, both were spectacular. How have I lived here over a year and just found this place?!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, the first time was very close to when they had opened up and they had a special seafood Landry which I had never had before and it was really good. The second time, I was here I found out that the Landry was only available as a special and not part of the normal menu - so no Landry. I opted for the catfish with fries, but this was definitely not on the same level as the Landry. I wasn't a big fan of the cornmeal used on the fish.  Well if you are here and the Landry is on the menu remember to order it."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for Cajun food and found this gem in an online search. The crawfish ettoufee was outstanding and the jambalaya was bursting with flavor. A little pricey for the portion size, but definitely is worth trying. I'm adding it to my list of places for repeat business!"}
{"text":"The food is to die for,you can tell everything is made with love. I had the two meat entree which consisted of oysters & shrimp with red beans in rice.I don't want to start talking about how great the gumbo tasted. If your ever in the west valley I would recommend you to stop in: to enjoy some home cook food and great customer service."}
{"text":"Food was good service was a little slow at first, but then the waitress really stepped it up. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Good portions and decent price. We ordered a half order of fried pickles, a half order of hush puppies (6), the Dunkin Catfish and the shrimp creole. We are leaving stuffed.  Notes: the fried pickles are amazing and a must get.  The Cajun ranch dressing served with the pickles and with your salad (if you choose), is addicting.  The shrimp creole was a touch spicy for me. But the crawfish étouffée served with the Dunkin catfish could have used some spice.  The service was amazing and attentive.  I love this place and will come back for more."}
{"text":"My update is this: Order the Gumbo Plus.  Get the chicken and andouille gumbo and the oyster po'boy.  WOW!  Though it is definitely a filling lunch, it was so amazing on my taste buds that for at least an hour I craved a second lunch.  I'm coming back soon, with friends, just for this!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great prices; One of our favorite casual dinner places. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Who thought you could find such great Cajun food in Arizona. Thank you for good service and amazing food."}
{"text":"Don't read this as a negative review; 3 stars is good. Nothing was outstanding, it was what was expected from Cajun food in a suburb of Phoenix.  The Crab Landry was the best. The shrimp were cooked well and had good flavor.  The Jumbalaya had a nice smokey flavor.  The gumbo seemed to be missing some ingredients since it was a thin soup with average flavor.  The Cajun. Chips had light spice added to them.  The fried alligator was moist and we'll cooked.   The one thing missing was what always seems to pair with Cajun food - their desire to have something alcoholic with a meal. They only have soft drinks.   The staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Our waitress (Flower) was so sweet, personable and all around great! The food is on another level. Everything we tried was perfect from the hush puppies and cheese fries to the catfish, jambalaya and boudin balls. You can't go wrong. So happy to see them open up a location in chandler"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Got the shrimp creole, no other words can describe how great the quality of food is here"}
{"text":"The alligator was better than what we had in New Orleans!  Red beans and rice were great, fried shrimp was great fried chicken was great.  Fried green tomatoes were chips and soggy.  Seasoning for the breading was good, but a quarter cut would have been better.  They don't serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Food was cold and service was very slow. The owner came to the table to greet us, we asked a question about an item on the menu and she was not able to assist. As the owner of an establishment you should know the menu by heart. Received the check and was overcharged. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"My dad recently moved to Arizona and wanted to take us out this nice soul food restaurant! So I couldn't resist and I'm glad I didn't! Sadly I only snapped pictures of our desserts, I was already knee deep in my food before I realized I had forgotten to take a picture. But I will let you know that my blackened catfish sandwich was the best I've had! The fish was seasoned perfectly and the salad was fresh. The staff is super friendly and attentive. I will be back when I visit again!"}
{"text":"Delicious Cajun food!!! Try the alligator! Inside feels like Louisiana and it all smells so good!"}
{"text":"So I came here for my supervisors last meal with the office. I've NEVER had food from Louisiana but was so excited. I had a friend who really talked it up. I don't have anything to compare it to, however it seems pretty legit. It's a really cute place and the people here are really nice. You walk up and you order and pay right away. I got crab Landry. I don't even know how to explain it. I just like crab and I like what I read about it on the menu. So I ordered it. It was really good. I actually almost got the shrimp creole. Which to be honest I think I liked that more based on flavor. My friend got it and I tried it. They were both good I just liked the seasoning of the shrimp creole better. I will definitely be eating here again. I can definitely say I feel l was in the south eating here!"}
{"text":"Was in the area so stopped in at the suggestion of a friend. Glad I did great Cajun food. Having lived in Lafayette for a few years I know how to cook cajun and so does Flavors.  Highly recommend and will go again."}
{"text":"Took my family, we were in the mood for catfish and some gumbo. The wait time was a little lengthy but it was absolutely worth the wait! This is definitely our new favorite place!"}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming my favorite place to eat out! Everything I have had here has been excellent. The shrimp po boy is wonderful and the gumbo, wow! I tried the catfish for the first time today and it was perfect. Every time I leave this place I'm planning the next time I'm going to come back."}
{"text":"Our fist visit was rough, We waited for our dinner for 45 minutes with empty tables all around us. Our waitress was inattentive and was taking drinks before bringing us refills. It was sad really that by the time we got up and left they said our food was still going to be a couple more minutes.  We had really high hopes for this place and I gave it Two stars for solid sweet tea.  Our return visit was a full 180 from the original, a friend and I had 12 inch po boys (more like 18 inchers) and they were outstanding and entirely too much food. The fried oyster and blackened shrimp were both great, and we had the banana pudding and peach cobbler, which were OUTSTANDING. one of our new faves.   The wait times here aren't the shortest, so be ready for that or order to go."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The service was kind of slow, but the food quality and the atmosphere will have us coming back. I highly recommend eating here. The deserts were amazing too!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed by this and I really wanted to be.   I got the gumbo and shrimp po-boy. I have had po-boy's in St. Louis which shares a lot of food culture with Louisiana and this one just wasn't up to par. It seemed like frozen popcorn shrimp on some bread with a ton of mayo and some lettuce.   The gumbo was kind of bland and reminded me of the stuff from a progresso can.  I may be willing to give this place another shot but it won't be until after I finish exploring my other lunch options in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place. I'm rather simple I usually get a po boy and gumbo,  but everything I've had there is awesome. The staff is friendly and always remembers us when we come in."}
{"text":"Service is great, everyone is super nice with lots of personality. Food was flavorful and hit the spot. I've been to New Orleans plenty and this place definitely offers an authentic feel. Loved it!"}
{"text":"FREAKING AMAZING !!!!!! The most delicious shrimp sandwhich I've ever had ! I got the Shrip Po-Boy and my boyfriend got the Catfish Po-Boy ! I have to say the food was great although it was a little pricey we are still going to come back ! My boyfriend fell in love with this place ! You have to try it !"}
{"text":"The pros: fried pickles were really good - loved the breaking. Our waitress was very friendly and personable, loved her! Wish I could remember her name. Finally, the sweet tea was great! I normally hate tea so I was pleasantly surprised by that.  The cons: when we first walked in an older gentleman asked a staff member for silverware and she ROLLED HER EYES and said she \"would get to it.\" Okay, that wasn't directed towards me but it definitely didn't give a good first impression. The food was gross. I hate leaving a full plate and I did. Catfish was eh and the crawfish etouffee was repulsive. The person I was with had the crab Landry and he ate maybe half of it. I tried it and I was surprised he could even get through that.  Definitely won't be returning or recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Sure it is way out in the west Valley but the drive is much shorter then a flight to Baton Rouge for those who want prime Cajun flavor.  The ingredients of the shrimp Po Boy blend together like the sweet sounds of Dixeland jazz and the offering here is akin to listening to that jazz performed by Louie Armstrong.  It's a shame this isn't more central to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great place to go visit. Felt like I was in a different place and the food is younique.  Service was good. I'll go back for sure. My husband loved it to."}
{"text":"First time here. The blackened alligator was way better then the alligator I had in New Orleans down in the French Quarter.   I will definitely be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"loved everything alligator po boy and catfish.      Coleslaw was great I'm just sorry I haven't been here sooner.  Military discount on Wednesday.  Thanks Anna.     Will try to stop by every week if I can.  Cajun hideaway in Arizona have to try peach cobbler next time."}
{"text":"This place is more than good!  Great flavorful Louisiana cuisine.  Everything cooked to order and I can not say enough about the lightening fast service.  Last but not least our server Jenna was top notch.  She was friendly and very knowledgable.  I see this as one of my favorite new restaurants and can't wait to introduce my family and friends."}
{"text":"Louisiana meets Arizona  My friends and I are always on the lookout for non-chain restaurants in the West Valley. After reading fellow \"yelpers\" reviews, we decided to give Flavors of Louisiana a shot and I am so glad we did. Flavors of Louisiana got it right. Fresh food, flavorful ingredients, large portions, modest prices, excellent cutomer service and  easy access parking out front.  Flavors of Louisiana has a  laid back casual atmosphere.  As you walk in you see the front cashier where you order your food.  On the walls are some LSU teeshirts and logos , a bayou mural on another wall, and smiling and helpful staff.   On our first visit we shared, catfish Po-Boy, hush puppies, shrimp, fresh bread, and Boudin Balls. Everything was perfectly breaded and fresh. We also had sides of the Red Beans and Rice (highly recommend) as well as cole slaw which was also very good. Flavors of Louisiana offers great food for the money! (each sandwhich & side are about $10 for the 6\").  If you ever in the area you should give flavors of Louisiana a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food, reasonable prices, fast and friendly service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Was recommended by a friend from New Orleans and has not let down 3/3 times  will be back again it's worth the 30 minute drive if you love home style cooking! Best southern food I've found in AZ"}
{"text":"Super good food. Great choices. great service. What more can you ask for. Not great ambience. I guess you could ask for ambience!"}
{"text":"This is a tough review to write.  My star rating is an average of some pretty poor traits and some really outstanding traits.  Upon arrival there was no one in the front area to greet us.  We had to stand around a few minutes until we were noticed, at which point we were seated pretty promptly.  Our table ordered a variety of things including the Cajun trio (which has gumbo, jambalaya, and crawfish pie).   The chicken sausage gumbo was ok.  I expected much stronger flavor there.  Andouille sausage and the spices should have created a bold soup, but it really wasn't.  We also ordered a seafood gumbo.  For some reason that one was better, and I usually prefer the chicken/sausage version (that's what we make at home). But the seafood version was more flavorful.  In my opinion, they need to fix the chicken/sausage version.  The jambalaya was great, but not tomato based.  I've never encountered that before.  It was really good.  It was a \"dirty rice\" dish instead of a tomato-based one.   I didn't try them, but I was told the deep fried oysters were very good.  The fries/chips that came with them seemed to me to be just slightly burned.  They weren't black, but there was a subtle burned flavor that told me they probably cooked them a minute or two too long.  The crawfish pie was unique.  It was sort of like a Cajun calzone.  It was very tasty.  I did notice a definite mustard flavor (they put it on the outside), and I don't like mustard, but if you got a good bite with the crawfish filling then the flavor worked.  I did try the dunkin catfish, and it was really good.  They used an etouffee sauce, and it really went well with the catfish (which is a pretty strong-flavored fish).  That and the jambalaya were probably my favorite items that we tried.  So with all of that I'd probably go 4 stars.  But there were two significant problems.  First problem:  they are seriously understaffed.  I saw one bus-person, and two servers who also doubled as greeters, phone answerers, cashiers, and apparently some kitchen-related duties as they would disappear into the kitchen for significant periods of time.  We saw at least two tables walk out because of lack of service.  Given how busy they apparently are they need to hire at least one more serving person.  Service was friendly when you could get someone, but I have to deduct for this.  Second problem:  portions/value.  This one is a bit mixed.  My dunkin catfish was quite adequate.  The Cajun trio was a little skimpy on the gumbo and jambalaya (they could have used slightly larger bowls), but the crawfish pie was a good size.  The \"22 oz seafood gumbo\" was not 22 oz.  Not even close, really.  And they charged a lot for it.  I would guess the amount was actually between 12 oz and 16 oz.  That's a HUGE difference compared to the claimed 22 oz..  We confirmed with them that we were not given an incorrect size.  That was the \"22 oz\".  But there is not a chance it was really 22 oz.  They need to fix that.  Either really give 22 oz, or change the description on the menu.  This is a major deduction for both value and for a deceptive description in the menu.  I tortured myself a bit over this one.  Four-star food, but two-star service and two-star value.  I really want to give them three stars, but I just can't get there with these significant deductions.  If they fix the two problems I mentioned above I'd be quite comfortable awarding four stars.  And I do hope they fix them because I really liked some of the dishes.  UPDATE:  We went again this week.  But we did a to-go order.  Food was still good, as described above.  However, I did want to add that the to-go gumbo really was 22 oz.  I measured the container when we got home.  I still believe the bowl was significantly smaller, but the to-go order does use the correct size and you do get what they advertise.  So I will bump them one more star."}
{"text":"Wow what a great find. I have been to Louisiana and this is pretty authentic. I had the chicken and sausage gumbo and dirty rice. Was so delicious. They serve water in a mason jar. Playing Cajun music and has a warm feel."}
{"text":"This place was super tasty. Far exceeded our expectation!!!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome, definitely recommend the catfish and the green tomatoes!  The staff was friendly and welcoming, food is always great!!"}
{"text":"I had the crawfish étouffée and it was delicious and jam packed with flavor. My only complain is that the crawfish was a little overcooked. Our waiter was very friendly and generous. We had their sweet tea (ah-ma-zing) and the waiter gave us 2 sweet teas to go when we only ordered one glass. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Amazing place! The atmosphere, the people, and the food are all top quality. You will pay $10-$20 per person for drinks and your meal- however it is totally worth it. Not for people who like bland food or anyone who needs to limit their salt. Definitely a foodies paradise"}
{"text":"Great food, good service. Fried green tomatoes and veggie po'boy very good and the jars to drink out of truly make it authentic."}
{"text":"2 years have passed since my first review and I must say that the food, cleanliness, and staff remain top notch!"}
{"text":"NICE TRY........but the shortcuts taken here left me deflated.   Your perception of this restaurant's food will depend on your life experience with creole/Cajun  food.   If you've never visited Louisiana (or the south for that matter),  your chances for liking the food are infinitely x10. greater.   This place is popular not because the food is good,  but because most of the customers have limited exposure to good Louisiana cooking.    Seafood Gumbo- Tasted like a hot nasty ratchet mess... no matter where you're from.  The roux looks and taste like someone's dirty bath water from the previous night.  There was one grey shrimp and what looked like a piece fat floating in it.  No bell pepper, onion, garlic, or okra?  (Basic gumbo ingredients) How can the owner's say they're from Baton Rouge, LA and serve wack gumbo.     Jambalaya- i was greatly perplexed here.  It was quite tasty, despite not having garlic, celery, bell pepper and onion (holy trinity of nawlins cooking) And the rice being very mushy, starchy and clearly over cooked.  I could not visually discern what kind of meat was used.    Crawfish pie- Also tasty but really needed more meat and less cream cheese and oil.    Banana pudding-  although this was box pudding  it was actually very good.  I enjoy this more than  all of the aforementioned dishes.  My only complaint is they do not include whole vanilla wafer cookies; instead they crumble up cookies and sprinkle it on top. Guess there's an attempt to save money here.  Ummm  Give me a whole cookie please,  at least one O o !    The main problem with this restaurant is there trying to do too much!  They're menu has many different dishes.   What they should do is make a few dishes and cook them well... this way their cooking has a more reliable outcome."}
{"text":"All the hype about this place is 100% understood now that my husband and I have tried for ourselves!!! Delicious food and all homemade!! So glad I found this little gem! Tried the blackened alligator which was neat! To eat, I had the catfish on rice with crawfish étouffée which was amazing! Wiped my plate clean. I love that this place is family owned.. Our waitress gave us great hospitality and was very kind.. The sweet tea was so good too and we were able to refill and take to-go cups with us to enjoy! We will be back"}
{"text":"Excellent ownership. Give The restaurant a try. This is the only other Cajun restaurant besides Papaduex."}
{"text":"It's not quite New Orleans but it's darn close. The Dunkin Catfish was the bidness! The étouffée wasn't as flavorful as what I had in Nawlins but it was still really good. The crawfish was spot on, the catfish was perfect, and the red beans and rice was amazing. The service was great. We had an amazing waitress. I would definitely recommend this place to others searching for that New Orleans flavor."}
{"text":"Their gumbo is awesome, full of flavor but not too spicy or overpowering.  They also have good fries for the kids."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. I had the Catfish lunch special w/ red beans and rice. Yummmmy!  Wish it was closer to the house."}
{"text":"After waiting at our table, for over an hour to eat, we left. Frustrating as i was excited to try a new place. It was not super busy either!! The manager was supposed to come and talk with us, but after 5 plus minutes waiting for him , we just left. Guess subway it is!"}
{"text":"Cajun/Creole in the West Valley.....wow what a treat. Now while on this day I didn't have any of the food entree's.... I did have the dessert. The special today was peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream.....and let me state for the record it was THE BEST peach cobbler I HAVE EVER had served to me in restaurant. Now trust me when I tell you.....if it is on the menu the day you decide to visit this establishment......ORDER IT ASAP. The reason I say that is because it is not on the EVERYDAY menu.....that really needs to change by the way. If you have read any of my other reviews you will notice I am a bit of an expert when it comes to eating out and having great food.....well you can add this review to that list. I don't know when I will be passing through these neck of the woods again....but when I do \"Flavors of Louisiana\" will definitely be a \"MUST STOP\". Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I had a po boy with fried green tomatoes and the cajun trio.  The good:   They let me order a mixed shrimp/oyster/crawfish po boy.   The crawfish pie on the trio is flaky and buttery and full of crawfish. Fried green tomatoes are well coated; I hate when the coating falls off in your hand. Jambalaya is really good. Fries are oddly cut but in a good way ... they would have been great had they been hot.  The bad:   Despite taking a particularly long time, when our food finally came everything but the crawfish pie was cold.  Obviously, our order was sitting waiting for the pie for a while.  Would have been 4 stars had the food been hot. The gumbo was a salt lick.  Completely inedible.  Got some beignets to go for dessert and because it was a single item that didn't have to meet up with anything else, they arrived hot and how can fried dough covered in sugar be bad? Word of warning:  Don't try to eat a beignet in the car with the AC blowing.  It looks like it snowed in my car."}
{"text":"Amazing crawfish. Every time I want some Cajun food, I pull right up to here.  Workers always treat me good."}
{"text":"This food was amazing... I felt like I was in Louisiana, we had great service very friendly.  I loved the Ice Tea and the shrimp creole !! Will go back again !"}
{"text":"The oyster Po' Boy was amazing!- loved it! The seafood gumbo was terrific- very flavorful, but not thick and gloopy. We also really enjoyed the Cajun chips. The only thing I wish we could have had with our meal was a nice cold beer! The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, small and 'diner-like', but when my brother and I went there a few Fridays ago, the line backed up to the door to place an order.   It was a drive to get out there, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Food was really good: seafood gumbo, crawfish pie, fried green tomatoes, hushpuppies, jambalaya. Didn't have room for dessert so we took home peach cobbler. It was made with canned peaches but the flavor and texture were good with a crispy topping. The pace was clean including the restrooms and the knowledgeable courseteous staff was prompt without being pushy."}
{"text":"This place transports your tastebuds to New Orleans, a definite must!!! Dine in or take out you will not be dissatisfied!!"}
{"text":"Very good food....a great place when you really miss NOLA food. Good service, fairly priced and clean."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago on recommendation from a friend. This place had a cozy feel to it, but I thought the food was a little pricey. And food seems a little dry to me. Everything there is pretty much deep fried and beer battered . Food is pretty heavy here and I probably wont be coming back. But I have to say the staff is nice here."}
{"text":"If you want Cajun food, THIS IS THE SPOT! I'm looking forward to Mardi Gras next Tuesday."}
{"text":"Hands down best place to eat southern Louisiana food.. the staff is super friendly the food is amazing you definitely have to check this place out !!! I rarely ever give a restaurant 5 stars but this place definitely deserves that 100%..."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times in the past and always had a great experience.  I am not entirely sure if there was new staff in the kitchen along with waiting on tables but last night was sub par.  I waited 15 minutes and only had drinks served due to tracking down someone.  The jambalaya was flavorful and served as the highlight however the friend green tomatoes was over cooked and lacked a good sauce for dipping and the gumbo (chicken and sausage) was way to salty with a sauce that didn't taste anything like it had in the past.    All that said I will still go back and give these guys another try as I want to believe it was only a bad night.   Past experiences drive me to have faith and still recommend this restaurant as somewhere that people should check out at least once."}
{"text":"Not so good! I had the aligator and crawfish combo. Both were way over cooked and very tough. The breading was too heavy and didn't have any flavor."}
{"text":"We are always loking for places to eat that remind us of places we've lived or visited.  On this day it seemed like a good day for a Louisiana roast beef po-boy. We've been to Johnny's and to Pakway's several times in New Orleans and they both serve these amazing hot roast beef po-boys, dripping in sauce (mixture of beef au jus and mayo) topped lightly with a little lettuce, a few tomatoes and pickles all wrapped up in a very crunchy baguette role. So we Yelped po-boy places and Flavors of Louisiana popped up.  At first we had a hard time finding the Flavors of Louisiana.  Its set off the very busiy road in a small strip center, so look for their sign atop the building.  The Yelp directions will take you right to it.   Well we were hopping to find a roast beef po-boy like we would get at Johnny's or Parkway's in New Orleans but... not here unfortunately.  What we did find was an amazing shrimp po-boy and some excellent fried catfish topped with crawfish étouffée.   Both were very good and very similar to what we would find in New Orleans.  We also had some gumbo, which was good but missing the roux was too thin and missing the andouille sausage but had plenty of shrimp and crab.    This is a great place to eat if you're craving some southern fried catfish or even a fried shrimp po-boy!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My wife and i came here for lunch. We had the Oyster Po Boy, Seafood Gumbo & Dunkin Catfish. I don't usually write reviews but the food was excellent and the staff were GENUINELY friendly! Its sad that quality is rare in customer service, but when encountered it should be acknowledged. The owners even served food and socilaized with customers. Ill definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is such a gem in the west valley. There are few non chain restaurants in my area of town and Flavors of Louisiana stands above and beyond. I have been to this establishment four times and there is nothing on the menu to stay clear of. If I could recommend anything, I would say the Po Boys are a must.........a must. I have had the shrimp, alligator, and chicken and they are all da bomb. One more bit of advice, avoid the banana pudding because it is alllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll minnnnnnnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love it!!!!!!!!! Great place, great staff, great place."}
{"text":"We love this place! I am sure all of their food is good since I have heard very positive statements from friends, but I can only recommend the shrimp po'boy. I had this on my first visit and haven't been able to order anything else. Each time I promise to try the alligator or oyster po'boy on the next visit, but I am afraid of regretting not having the delicious shrimp. Oh yeah - I had bites of the fried green tomatoes and the gumbo thanks to going to Flavors with friends. Both dishes were yummy. I guess the moral is take friends so you can try different dishes."}
{"text":"Slightly disappointed with this place.  I love cajun/creole and really wanted to try, but found the food here to be average at best.  It's a decent approximation but not quite what was expected, if I'm gonna drive halfway across Phoenix I'd rather go to Baby Kay's in the east valley."}
{"text":"Great great  Service easterly good. Fried green tomatoes where excellent and have a nice tang. The shrimp poor boy had lots of shrimp and a nice sauce.  My wife had the dunkin catfish which was really good.  Everything coming out of the kitchen look good.  Was busy and even had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.   Lots of takeout we noticed.  This is a hidden gem if you really like Louisiana food give it a try."}
{"text":"The food is good enough. It's not like Louisiana but it works for being out in Arizona. I'll definitely be coming back. I got the drunkin catfish."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is so authentic. The owners are from Louisiana and make home cooking Cajun food here. I can't get enough of the chicken and sausage gumbo. Plus the grilled alligator is great too. But you can never go wrong with anything on the menu. I am a big fan of this place."}
{"text":"The food at Flavors of Louisiana really is spectacular and we look forward to eating here on a regular basis. Excellent Catfish, Gumbo, Red beans and Rice, Smoked Sausage. I am looking forward to trying other dishes. This is a must try!!  =0)"}
{"text":"The strawberry lemonade is awesome and sweet! The sweat tea is good too but cloudy so they may need to wash their containers or change their water filter. 12 years in a restaurant will teach you stuff like this :) The jambalaya was good but the meat in it, was dry. The gumbo was good but definitely seafood tasting, different from other gumbos I have had. The kids chicken tenders and fries was the best meal! The chicken was tender and fries were fresh, all tasted delicious, my two year old loved it! Don't forget to eat the beignets those were fresh and tasty too! I'll be back for some of those items. Mmmm!  Thanks for the great service too! They are very nice here."}
{"text":"The Muffeletta sandwich is amazing. They don't serve it on the proper round loaves but the flavor is fantastic! The jambalaya is also good."}
{"text":"Second time at this restaurant and it was just as yummy as before. Great specials, great food and great service."}
{"text":"A lot of the food is mostly fried.   You can do blackened. Gumbo was good, but salty.  Shrimp creole was ok...but sugary. Alligator po boy was average. Mostly bread. We didn't do dessert No alcoholic beverages.  5/10"}
{"text":"Very good creole food...nice surprise in Phoenix. We tried the shrimp po boy and red beans and rice. We also had potato salad (whole made), cheese cake, and peach cobbler. All very good! We will be back."}
{"text":"This will now be my only place I will go to for gumbo, Cajun shrimp, and fried green tomatoes. Gotta drink it down with sweet tea. No room for dessert this time but will just have to come back again.  Make sure to use the Louisiana gold pepper sauce on your hush puppy. Delish'"}
{"text":"I went here a week ago believing the positive reviews. They were so wrong. I agree with all of the negative reviews. Jambalaya was dry and tasteless. Seafood gumbo was all salty liquid with a few shrimps. Very small portions. Poorboy sandwich was only about 4 inches long. Pappadeaux's is more expensive but 10 times better in taste, portions and quality. I would not come back to this place. I don't recommend this place. Go to Pappadeaux's instead and actually enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"Me, hubby and the kids came here the other night for dinner. We truly enjoyed ourselves! Really, really loved our waitress...she was so nice and completely chatty with us, which we loved! She really made our visit there welcoming. I can't remember her name but I do know she is new there and she wears glasses. Haha.   They have great portion sizes for the cost of the dish. Which is also very reasonably priced. Very cute and pleasant environment. Food was really, really good! Everything came out on time and HOT! (NOT too hot but just right) and delicious. Their sweet tea was delicious, fried crawfish was yummy! Blackened alligator was moist and tasty! And their pecan praline cheese cake and peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream was to die for! Great, great restaurant! Great staff! GREAT, GREAT FOOD!"}
{"text":"not much to say but amazing food and really nice people! everything is great,i always get the shrimp and onion rings and the chicken strips for the kids even those are great!"}
{"text":"We found this place and almost didn't go in because of the cafeteria style decor. I love jambalaya but I didn't realize I had never actually eaten jambalaya until I ate here! So good! We had the fried green tomatoes, which again were the best I've ever had and the beignets for desert which were so light and delicious. The next time we were planning to go out that way I dreamed for two days of eating there only to find out they are closed on Sundays! Ohhh!"}
{"text":"Had the shrimp po boy. Got the 12\" size and the dirty rice.  The rice was great. Flavored well The sandwich was huge. I should have saved half for later but the roll was crusty and chewy and I didn't want to save it!! Thanks all! Will recommend for sure"}
{"text":"Felt like I was in New Orleans, food was authentic and very good!  If you enjoy the New Orleans charm, with great food and affordable, this is the place to go!!  Try the Crawfish Pie."}
{"text":"Fun and flavorful! Definitely a must try in the Goodyear/Avondale area. I mean a soithern girl cant say no to some good sweet tea. Recommend the gumbo and fried pickles!"}
{"text":"Husband and I were passing through Phoenix/Avondale last Saturday and stopped in here to eat. It was super busy and obviously a popular spot. We were sat fairly soon and had a great waitress, Susan. She was so nice and knowledgeable about the menu... and recommended the Po' boy, which we both had. She was Super attentive and fun and made our experience enjoyable. We had our sandwiches, which were hot and fresh and great! The food was really good but the service was better. I love when a server goes above and beyond and she did! I'll definitely stop by here again and recommend you do too!"}
{"text":"My mom and I really enjoyed the food.  The staff were really attentive and explained all the menu choices (mom does not like spicy)."}
{"text":"Really delicious food but if you are allergic to MSG beware most food does have it. If you are catering they will make it without for you! Love this place for west valley cajun"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and at a decent price. We shared the lunch special with an appetizer and had leftovers!"}
{"text":"I was wanting some Louisiana home cooking so bad that I decided to give this restaurant another try. Service was a bit slow and the food, unfortunately, was terrible again! I'm sorry but this is not true Louisiana food! The Shrimp  Creole was way too spicy and didn't have enough tomato paste in it. The shrimp also seemed a little undercooked. I'm not sure what the red beans and rice had in it but the flavor was all wrong!  The beignets were fine but the portion much too small!  The sweet tea was true southern style though, and was delicious!  I guess we are going to have to do the cooking at home if we want true Louisiana style food."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to FOL and I have been dreaming of their fried shrimp since having the crab Landry the first time I was here. Can't wait to try the shrimp po boy."}
{"text":"Excellent Louisiana country cuisine. Fried green tomatoes are worth the drive. We have not had anything we didn't like. The muffuletta is really po boy with those flavors which I now prefer. The menu implies it but more explicit info may help with disappointment  again I had none. I expected po boy lettuce tomato etc. so now you will too!  Everything else is as you would expect. Lots of flavor but not too spicy."}
{"text":"Great food & very friendly staff.  We got the Shrimp Creole & the Cajun Trio, both tasty with the equivalent of home cooking.  The peach cobbler was delicious & passed my friend's test, who is from the South & has some experience with this dessert.  The owner chatted with my friend & I and told us how the restaurant got started.  Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here for the first time.  It will not be the last.  My group of six ordered a variety of things and it was all amazing.  You can tell that everything is made in house and to order.  Someone else complained about it being slow, and we didn't experience that.  I would say it's a leisurely pace, but to get fresh food like this, it's worth slowing down for the night.  The staff was all friendly and attentive.  Best hushpuppies I've ever had.  Gumbo was awesome.  My daughter's kids meal was huge shrimp, that I stole a bite of, and they were great.  The crawfish pie will be the craving of my dreams for weeks.  Beignets were perfect pillows of yummy goodness.  I can't wait to go back.  I'll be wearing stretchy pants next time.  Too good to put in a to go box."}
{"text":"The hushpuppies are good but large. Don't order too many of them. Had the trio plate for dinner. The jambalaya had good flavor but almost no meat. The seafood gumbo was fine. The crawfish pit was good for the first few bites but then the heaviness set it. All in all the food was good but nothing special I would seek out again."}
{"text":"Genuine, great Cajun food in an unassuming place. The blackened catfish was incredible! Also, strange minor detail but get the iced tea, it's surprisingly good too."}
{"text":"The service and food were equally amazing. The sweet tea is what you would call southern sweet tea, meaning so sweet it will hurt your teeth :). It was our first time there but the server was excellent in suggesting dishes and well as giving us a background of the food and restaurant."}
{"text":"Our first time here and it was GOOD and very filling.  Left here with my pants unbotten! Our swrver Alto was very attentive & nice.  But I may say, I will come back again cause its that good! Like mighty tasty good!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken Sausage Gumbo, Shrimp Po'Boy and  Beignets - very good great French Bread.  Going for the etouffee."}
{"text":"Very good and great service. I highly recommend the gumbo and the po' boy sandwiches. Just be prepared for a long wait. Take out took about 1 hour."}
{"text":"There are 2 reasons to rate a restaurant, the food and the service and in this case, the food was good but the service - not at all near par.  Went for lunch with my coworkers thinking it's down the street we should be done within an hour, boy were we wrong.   The place was not crowded or busy for me to empathize with the wait staff, getting our drinks took longer than it needed to be. Our food took especially longer to arrive at our table. The waiter just was not hospitable, no sense of urgency and after asking for an update on our appetizer after 20 mins - cajun fries, the waiters response was \"oh, maybe 15 mins more I need to go check on it not sure why it's taking so long\".   There were other instances and let's leave it as if I ever go back, I'll be calling in my order to pick up - hopefully that will be within reasonable time frame.  If you have time to just sit around then I'd say you found your place to dine."}
{"text":"First time here, I have heard about this place for years and it didn't dissapoint. I will definitely be making this a regular stop of mine . affordable and great service!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, food was so-so, I won't return even if I had a coupon for a free dinner for four.  I had Shrimp Et toufee and my mother ordered blackend catfish.  The waiter was busy and brought both meals together.  My et toufee was boring and bland.  The best part was the bread but in my opinion, the bread was standard garlic bread from the store.  The cajun potatos were bland and I could duplicate the dish at home with lawry's seasoning and chopped potatos.      The biggest disappointment was the catfish.  Initially the waiter brought my mother breaded catfish.  We sent the fish back and the waiter return with blackend catish approximately 20 minutes later.  My mom and I spent easily an hour to two hours at the restaurant.    The fish came out of the kitchen but had a rubbery texture and I wasn't sure it was cooked thoroughly.  I soaked a napkin completely in the oil that came on the fish until there was no white material of the napkin.  I enjoyed the flavor of the fish but I thought blackend catfish was cooked until stiff with little to no oils left on the meat? Either way I wasn't impressed at all.  I could tell the shrimp wasn't fresh but what did I expect in the desert of Arizona?  Skip the business unless you are desperate.  I won't return.  I recommend driving to the coast of Texas or Louisiana for better southern food."}
{"text":"Second visit, second wow!  As a displaced coastal Texan, I miss great seafood and the the flavors of Cajun friend's cooking.  I think I have found a new home.  The gumbo is thinner than I prefer, but is otherwise to die for.  All of my order was served too hot (thermally) to eat.  It is a bit cruel to have to smell the aroma of great food while waiting for it to cool.  Clearly, everything is cooked to order.  Service is a bit slow, but very worth the wait.  A lot quicker than a flight to Louisiana.    This visit they were out of bread pudding with bourbon sauce . . . darn.  After I ordered fried green tomatoes, they let me know they were out  also . . . darn.  After stuffing myself on seafood gumbo, fried catfish, boudin balls and red beans and rice, I saw banana pudding on the daily special menu.  The waitress said it was scratch made.  OK, this was a challenge.  Restaurants usually open a number 10 can of pudding and adorn with some sliced bananas.  I've never had decent banana pudding unless I made it because I make excellent banana pudding.  Wow, this one was too close to call.  Definitely scratch made.    A bit pricey for a plain diner style restaurant.  I paid around $30 for my dinner.  As a food snob, I usually don't get out of restaurants for under $75.  If you want cheap, stick to McDonald's.  Quality is worth the price.  I got more than my monies worth.   So, in two visits, I've been impressed twice.  Thanks for serving my ultimate comfort food."}
{"text":"As an LSU alum, I can verify this place is LEGIT. Had the jambalaya, red beans and chicken and sausage gumbo. Plus, finished off the meal with some perfect beignets. Better than Cafe du Monde in my opinion.  Now,  all they need is a frozen daiquiri machine and I'll move in!"}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try.  EVERYTHING was excellent.  The servers are sweet,  know the menu and on top of it. I ordered a 6\" chicken po boy and it was a huge sandwich, and it was seasoned; came out hot on fresh bread. My potato salad side was great too. I tasted the jimbalaya and dirty rice,  also delish!  Recommend this place,  we will definitely be coming back here.  Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"What a place. The food is incredible. I had the Jouliet rouge and seafood gumbo. The gumbo as great flavor, and full of crab, shrimp, crawfish. The Jouliet Rouge; Blackened catfish, on top of dirty rice, covered in shrimp and crawfish sauce.  Wow, this makes me yearn for my Louisiana trip to come sooner, however I will be back. On top of everything the prices are great, as well."}
{"text":"I love this place! I wish I stayed closer but it's probably a good thing I don't lol I would go here everyday! I love the fried pickles, okra, fish, oysters and most of all the PEACH COBBLER! Being that it's my favorite dessert i've tried a lot of places that offer it and it's always watery or dry. FoL perfect it so well. The customer service that's  provided is always great and the food is always steaming hot. Definitely a place to try out."}
{"text":"We were in town from NY and looking for a gluten free restaurant for my wife. I love Cajun type food and gave it a try thanks to yelp reviews. You order from the counter when you get there. There is a decent menu with many options. Note there is no alcohol sold here. The food preparation and quality is outstanding. Prices are economical. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My fellow Yelper's have once again steered me in the right direction for tasty eats.  As another reviewer mentioned, the restaurant is a little hard to spot in the back of a shopping plaza, however now that I have found it, it is easy to get in and out of.  Upon entering you are greeted with the wonderful sounds of Louisiana jazz music. The decor itself, is not over done, simple and inviting.  The staff was friendly and I was immediately seated.   I ordered 1/2 Fried Green Tomatoes for a starter with sweet tea.  The sweet tea comes in a pickling jar and was delicious and had the right amount of sugar.  The Fried Green Tomatoes were crispy and tasted like what I was hoping for, tangy and crisp.  I ordered the Joliet Rouge, blackened cat fish on a bed of dirty rice, with crawfish/shrimp etouffee bathed over it.  It came with a side of beans and rice and garlic bread.  The dish was very good, I was pleasantly surprised that tastes of New Orleans could be found in a strip mall in Avondale AZ.  My only issue was that my ticket was shuffled or lost in the kitchen so my meal was late coming out.  When it did finally come out, it was hot and fresh.  The waiter apologized and offered a free peach cobbler, which I had to take to go as I was out of time and had to go to work.  I do recommend that they serve Cafe duMont coffee with chicory.  That would be a nice touch with a bengiet, since they served those, I would have expected to have the coffee to go with it.   The owner came over to my table to find out how every thing was,  I asked about the coffee since that is a true LA flavor.  She at least offered to order some!  I declined since I am traveling through but thought it was nice that she at least offered.   Bonus peach cobbler to go which I enjoyed later and it was very good.  I will be back, the Joliet Rouge was worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing food, first time and I had the dunkin catfish.\"WOW\" I will be back. I had carry out and I got to sit at home and enjoy my meal it was wonderful. I love it will be taking my family there very soon."}
{"text":"Really, really good. We are staying at Wigwam and saw the reviews. Worth every bite! Don't miss the hushpuppies (ask for garlic butter) and the Dunkin Catfish. We shared one entree and it was plenty. De-lish!"}
{"text":"After seeing Flavors of Louisiana on Check Please Arizona, I had to try it! It was well worth the drive to Avondale from my Central Phoenix home.   We started out with a combination appetizer. They give you the option of ordering three different appetizers in the combo because it is nearly impossible to decide on just one. We opted for the hush puppies, fried green tomatoes and fried pickles. All three were fantastic but the hush puppies were probably my favorite with the fried pickles a close second. You can choose from the many different dipping sauces they offer or have them all! We had the remoulade and Cajun ranch. The Cajun ranch was delicious!  Moving on to the main course.  We all had po boys. Several authentic entrees are offered at Flavors of Louisiana, but I am a po boy connoisseur. You can get your po boy about ten different ways there. I had the fried shrimp, my friends had fried tilapia and another had the muffuletta. I have not had a po boy this good since I was in New Orleans earlier this year!  Made in the traditional way with lettuce, tomatoes and mayonnaise on fantastic French bread. Served with a choice of sides such as potato salad, red beans and rice, cole slaw, fries, dirty rice, etc. or for $1.00 more you can get a cup of gumbo or jambalaya. I opted for the sausage gumbo (you can also choose seafood). Fantastic!!  For dessert we decided to try the beignets. They are nowhere near the ones you will find in Louisiana and have a different texture, but their version is still very good. We finished them off!  Drink selection is simple, sodas and iced tea, sweet or regular. Best sweet tea I have ever had and all you can drink!  Outstanding service!! Everyone who was working last night was very friendly. Our server Carlee was a gem. Outgoing, engaging and you can tell she really enjoys working there. The chef even came out to talk with us and to make sure we were enjoying everything.   All in all they do a fantastic job brining the \"Flavors of Louisiana\" to Arizona! I can't wait to go back!  Open Monday-Saturday for lunch and dinner. They are closed on Sunday.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Saw them featured on \"Check Please, Arizona\". Had to go. Glad I did! Funky little place in strip mall in Avondale. Don't let that keep you out. Food was excellent. Both my wife and I had the Shrimp Po Boys with cajun chips and shared an order of hushpuppies. There is no way you will leave hungry. Delicious and quite tasty. Do not miss out on this establishment!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment dinner was here the other night. Fairly busy, confusion on how to order, the sign says order at the counter, then we were told to sit. I ordered dunkin catfish with crawdad etouffee. The fish was hot the rice was cold and the etouffee was ice cold and hot on the other side.  Bit bland. her's was the jambalaya which was swimming in liquid smoke, I would have sent it back and ordered something else, inedible. Sorry cant do this again"}
{"text":"I've had Louisiana style food from different places and I'm not very sure this place can compete with them in terms of flavor. I had the luxury of trying different things from the menu like both the chicken and the shrimp po boys, catfish po boy, and some crawfish. The crawfish were fantastic but everything else was dull in flavor. I wish they offered some kind of unique house-made sauce, but instead offer Tobasco and Louisiana Hot sauce."}
{"text":"Very good food and a lot of it. The staff is very friendly. Get there early on the weekend looks like folks come from all over the valley."}
{"text":"I came here with my family after soccer and volleyball, so we were starved.  The hostess was very nice and asked if my daughters had won.  We had a shrimp po'boy, red beans and rice, gumbo, and chicken strips.  Everything was very tasty and homemade.  We also had  beignets, very yummy.  I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went to this particular a week ago for the first time, as we have been to the Avondale location several times and loved it.  I ordered the ettoufee and it was good,  however the service left a lot to be desired.  We had to constantly remind the waiter for beverage refills,  as they were busy running around soliciting to all of the patrons in the restaurant about the upcoming week's promotions and specials.  Then, when we finally had the opportunity to order desserts,  they were brought to us in to go packages! They also brought us the check before they brought the desserts.  I will continue to patronize the Avondale establishment but will never return to the Chandler establishment due to the sub-standard service."}
{"text":"Was so very impressed with this place. Crawfish Pie was soooooo good. Hubby had catfish Po Boy, was excellent. Only criticism I have is the fried green tomatoes were very thin.  Used to having nice thick slices.   Deep fried pickles would not order again.  Dirty rice was to die for so was the gumbo.  Live in Sun City but worth the trip.  Will go back.  Service was good and very helpful."}
{"text":"Good fresh food.  Ok prices but friendly staff.  Crawfish pivot was tasty and fresh.  Fried okra was good and fresh."}
{"text":"Has the best po'boy I've tasted (besides my dad's) hands down.  If you are ever in the mood for a shrimp po'boy then this is the place.  The Red beans and rice are pretty good, and so is the alligator.  All in all they have found a repeat customer with me"}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best Cajun meals in awhile. I absolutely loved the painted floor which resembles the bayou and the painted walls which added to the ambience of feeling like I was in Louisiana.  Excellent food and beignet for dessert. You can't go wrong and they have take out as well. One word of advice is I noticed that their hours are limited so better check in the evenings to see if they are still open. Located in a shopping center on the corner. From the outside it looks rather dumpy until you get Inside. I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Going to keep it short because no need to elaborate when the meal you just ate was delicious.  Fried green tomatoes, oyster po boy and a crawfish mixed with alligator po boy, all was wonderful. Service was excellent and was told next time must leave room for dessert. I said I will"}
{"text":"I had a shrimp poboy red beans and rice, it was delicious!! I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp po boy, dirty rice, and catfish with some delish sweet tea!!! ALL was excellent and we received very good service all around...will be back soon!!  You can also get delivery here through You Buy and We Fly: http://youbuyandwefly.deliverycheckout.com/"}
{"text":"This place is so good! We had Fried Green tomatoes, Dunkin Catfish, and the Cajun  trio! It was all excellent! One of the cooks even came out to tell us they didn't like the way the crawfish cake they made us came out so they made us another one to go! I thought the first one was great but the 2nd one was even better. They have great customer service there! I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Someone wrote a review pretty much saying that people love this restaurant only because they have never been to Louisiana and don't know what good food is, and pretty much writing a nagative review. First off, the food here is EXCELLENT! Full of flavor, and made to order coming out hot and fresh. So even if you haven't been to Louisiana, it really shouldn't matter if your looking for GREAT tasting food. My husband and I come here at least once a week and have never been dissapointed. I recommend the Fais do do which is 3 of their appetizers in one, which we get the hush puppies, fried green tomatoes and fried pickles which ARE THE BEST! You also won't be dissapointed in their po'boys. The fried catfish and crawfish po'boys are my fave! I suggest a side of the juice from the gumbo to use as a dipping sauce for your sandwich. The dirty rice is amazing, the red beans and rice is amazing, the gumbo is amazing, I just can't express how great tasting this place is. The sweet tea is perfect, not too sweet, just right. Like I said, you don't have to be a Louisiana native to enjoy your visit here. From what I have heard, the owners are from Louisiana and try to be as authentic as it comes. Give them a try. If you love you love it. If you dont, you don't. I give it 4 stars only because I wish they would stay open later! Btw- Jenna is my fave waitress! (They are all nice and welcoming though :))"}
{"text":"Service was so friendly and welcoming. Decor was super cute and makes you feel like you're in the Bayou ;) Chicken gumbo was BOMB. I really could have eaten a trough of it. We ordered the pickles and they were delicious! I also suggest the sweet tea... it really hit the spot. I will be back ASAP for that Gumbo!!!"}
{"text":"We love the location on the west side and was very excited to try this place however it turned out to be the biggest disappointment. We didn't even get to try the food  The service is not very good. Our drinks remained empty as we watched other tables drinks get refilled. The staff very rarely checks up on you, but we were willing to wait. We waited 50 minutes and watched people who arrived after us who ordered the same entrees as us get served before us which was the final straw. We ended up just walking out because we were starving and desperately needed dinner at that point. Depending on how patient you are, I would say try with very extreme caution and lots of time to spare. This restaurant has a broken process and I wish them the best of luck because they'll need it..."}
{"text":"Having family from NOLA, this restaurant was like we were visiting again. The food is spot on and fantastic, true Louisiana flavor in this little place.  Normally we wouldn't go all out and order so much food, but we really wanted to put this place to the test. I started with an unsweetened tea and it was perfectly bold and my glass never went dry. We tried the fried pickles as an appetizer  and they were wonderfully crispy and generous in size. They are not the little chips most places have, they are long slices, wonderfully paired with the Cajun ranch. Everyone in my family got something different; chicken strips that were huge and moist with a delicious breading, gumbo - the  small cup size which was perfect because the big bowl could have fed two or more of us! The crawfish étouffée was truly authentic, generous in size and my mouth is watering all over again just thinking about it. I got the crab Landry, it was a huge portion, honestly like a whole loaf of French bread smothered in a glorious tasting, bountifully loaded with real crab stew and some jumbo sized fried shrimp on the side (it was two meals!)  And lastly, but of course not least important, we saved a little room (by boxing up half our meals and taking it to go). We ordered the beignets and cheesecake smothered in praline sauce I share amongst all of us. Again it was amazing and truly authentic to the New Orleans flavor. It was like eating at the café Du Monde all over again. A little coffee to go with them and it would have been even better. We love this place and will be back many times!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently discovered this amazing gem. Now it seems like we go at least once a week. So nice to see an Arizona restaurant with such authentic Cajun cuisine. Great food, staff and atmosphere. Just ate there for lunch today. Had the shrimp meal with great gumbo. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time here based on others reviews  This is not genuine Cajun/creole food The gumbo that I received was a thin soupy consistency, and did not taste like any correctly made. No herbs were used in making this (Laurel, Thyme, and file should be used) there was no evidence that the roux had been correctly made or used.  I also had an oyster po boy, The oyster was overcooked and the baguette wasn't  crispy, the lettuce was wilted. This does not qualify as cajun or creole based on the food that I was raised with in a town called Lake Charles,"}
{"text":"Wow! We have been wanting to try this place for a while. Tonight we found ourselves kid free and decided to go out. This place has authentic Cajun and Creole food. My husband ordered the Dunkin Catfish. A bed of rice rice topped with 3 catfish strips and covered in crawfish ettoufe. He said it was amazing.  I ordered the catfish and shrimp combo. You can choose blackened or fried. I ordered both fried. The catfish was perfectly seasoned and crunchy outside and flakey inside. Not at all greasy. Very fresh. No muddy water taste you get with a lot of catfish restaurants serve. The 6  shrimp were large and I believe buttermilk dredged before coating. Perfectly cooked, not tough, not greasy.  You get your choice of sides. I order hush puppies. They were golf ball size and fluffy not gritty. Not very heavily seasoned. If you like strong seasoning in your hush puppies, skip them. There are 8 or 10 sides to choose from. These are very cakelike corn breadish.  The sweet tea was real southern sweet tea served in a large mason jar.  For dessert we ordered the beignets. Awesome! If you haven't tried Flavor of Louisiana, do it. You will not be sorry.  BTW they also offer call ahead take out. Our server was attentive but not obtrusive. She was very helpful with questions and recommendations."}
{"text":"The food and service was great... And I'd highly recommend saving room for dessert, specifically the cheesecake."}
{"text":"We had family visiting from Texas who were in the mood for redfish, and I'd been told by a friend that her husband enjoys this restaurant. They are from North Dakota and I guess that should have been a red flag for me. Long story short: there is no redfish on the menu, and when we walked in the restaurant smelled of old fish. We did not stay to be seated."}
{"text":"The flavors of Louisiana is mainly cajun style. I have tried the trio plate which comes with gumbo, jambalaya and crawfish pie. I asked for chicken and sausage gumbo but got seafood gumbo. My niece ordered the jambalaya plate. I wasn't pleased and my niece didn't like her dish. Not to mention, the waiter was unattentive. He took our drink order immediately but waited to give us them after he came back 10 minutes later to take our order. Then we waited quite awhile for the check which was incorrect.  I will say the crawfish pie was delicious but the jambalaya and gumbo wasn't worth wasting money on. Popeye's chicken has more Louisiana flavor."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's pretty 'hole in the wall' which always makes the best places. The chicken is THE. BEST. FRIED. CHICKEN. that I have ever had! The gumbo is great too! Jambalaya looks like it might taste dry but it's not at all, it's very good. The drinks are served in cute mason jars. The sweet tea is to die for! The employees I've encountered have been friendly and helpful. This place is very homey and yummy."}
{"text":"Waited forever it seems to try this place.  Walked in and was greeted nicely. Not gonna lie. This place was dead when we walked in. It was about 90 minutes till close. This is a new place to my knowledge, so maybe thats why.  This place does need to be heard though. I got the chicken and sausage gumbo and it tasted awesome. The sweet tea if amazing. I'm from South Carolina, and let me tell you. No one has sweet tea out here! So this was a big plus. There really isn't many places around where you can get a menu like this. So I understand why this place opened!   I wish this place was a tad bit closer to the ocotillo area, but I'll be making the drive. Its worth it.   Service 5/5 Food taste 4/5 Value 4/5 Restaurant cleanliness 5/5"}
{"text":"I have no earthly clue why I haven't written this review before now... although it probably has something to do with my hands being busy shoveling catfish into my mouth.   I can't say enough about how much I LOVE this place! I'm not much of a fish person, but I would smack my mama for some Flavors of Louisiana fried catfish. (Just kidding, Mom!) I'm also a huge fan of their shrimp po' boys, fried shrimp, peach cobbler and bread pudding - pretty much everything I've tried. A friend of mine swears there's nothing better than their dunkin' catfish (served on Saturday), but I haven't tried it yet. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, and I've been ordering the catfish, shrimp and fries for the last year at least.   Tip: don't you dare skip the dinner roll. It's delicious and worth every carb!"}
{"text":"Wasn't bad just kinda blah. Blackened catfish salad is what I had. Side of jambalaya Was very dry and not very flavorful. Fried green tomatoes were good."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with my family.  Food is  always delish.  Staff could be more attentive but nothing major.  Definitely would recommend"}
{"text":"This place has really good Cajun food. I had fried green tomatoes and hush puppies and a small cup of gumbo. All was good and served fast!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! If you're wanting some Louisiana inspired dishes, this is the only spot in Phoenix that can satisfy that Creole itch! My favorite dish is the crawfish etouffee and for dessert you must get some of the peach cobbler! Yummy!!! My husbands favorite is the fried green tomatoes, extra crispy with their creole ranch sauce."}
{"text":"Despite the nondescript outside, the onslaught of the spirits of the South that assault your nostrils tells you a totally different story. Guess there is a deficit on gator at the moment until June which was a tad disappointing but the girl behind the counter, daughter of the owner and (from the accent) a transplant from the south, was the most accommodating person ever and made us feel like family with alternate selections.   Had both the fried green tomatoes and the fried pickles. Each were excellent in their own right, with either a Cajun mustard or remoulade sauce. I had the Dunkin Catfish; 3 large strips of catfish, breaded by angels, and covered in crawfish entouffee. The amount of food was amazing.  If it's your first time there, plan on spending more than the one-$ listed, the more authentic creole dishes are a tad more pricey but completely worth it.   Word to the wise, save room for dessert, the peach cobbler was amazingly over the top."}
{"text":"First time stopping by this place. I placed a TO GO order and the staff were very pleasant. The food was ready by the time I got there. I ordered the fried green tomatoes and jambalaya special. The fried green tomatoes were perfect. I had them with Cajun ranch dip which made them even better!  The jambalaya was perfectly seasoned with bite sized chicken and sausage. They gave a pretty generous portion of it as well so be sure to have a healthy appetite when stopping by!  I will definitely be coming back for more!  It tastes like home in Louisiana!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, the staff are wonderful and all the food is amazing. I normally get crawfish poboy and it's the best ever."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! Authentic Cajun food at its best. The blackened catfish was great!"}
{"text":"They hit the name right on the spot.  If you're on a tighter budget and can't go to Pappadeaux, this place is just as good with reasonable prices.  Must have:  1) Crab Landry -  shredded crab meat mixed into this amazing sauce topped with fried shrimp and several garlic bread to dunk it in your bowl.  Definitely 5/5 stars. It is soooooo goooood you start thinking of licking the bowl.  2) Shrimp creole -  great spice with a hint of sweetness.  You don't start feeling the heat until half way through your meal.  3) Fried oysters - damn good but the only item that is unreasonable in price.  You can add on to your meal at $3 per pop.  Overall I highly recommend this place.  Definitely will try the other stuff soon."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere. Love this place. If you are looking for some Cajun food, whether it's your first time or a seasoned foodie, this the place to try. Awesome food, awesome customer service and respectable.  Lunch time is a bustle of area workers, and shoppers from the near-by strip malls. Every Wednesday they give a miltary discount. Definetly a food find in Avondale."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo underrated... the food is wonderful. The service is great. Came here by myself. The atmosphere is homey. Like you are at your cousins house for dinner. The location is a little obscure. The prices were very reasonable. You get ALOT of food for the price you pay. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"finally got to try this place, don't know what I've been waiting for, we did take out , 6 inch catfish po boy yum , bread was soft , catfish full of flavor, tarter sauce awesome, also shrimp basket excellent, o rings good , the fries were the bomb,  only small down side was it took 20 minutes for order to come out, also $24 for both lunches , otherwise can't wait to come back and try something new, great place"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for some time and I'm so glad I did! First off, the service was outstanding! I'm not sure of his name but he was extremely welcoming to because I told him I had never been there before! He thoroughly explained the menu, answered all of my questions and offer me some strawberry lemonade while I waited! I got the catfish and shrimp combo with reds beans and rice. It was delicious! The catfish was perfectly fried and well seasoned and the shrimp were excellent! The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the red beans and rice only come with andouille sausage is when you order it as a entree and not a side. Other than that I was quite pleased and so was my husband! I will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely going to be my and my mans go to for Cajun food! We just moved back to AZ from Louisiana and this place DID NOT disappoint!! Amazing amazing food, fast service, and our waitress Sheryl is the sweetest ever  I felt bad putting my food in a to go box but I could not finish it, so much yummy!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here is soooooo delicious!!!  Red beans n rice yum, gumbo regular and seafood is bomb AF, jambalaya is AMAZING with pieces of sausage n chicken seasonings on point!! shrimp is so good it's not all breading you get nice size shrimp lightly breaded highly recommend shrimp po'boy! And if I can have their sweet tea on tap at home best believe I'd have that! Dont leave with out trying their banana pudding... Thank me later"}
{"text":"Great mother of Gumbo! Flavors of Louisiana is good homestyle cajun cookin' right here in the desert!  The food has just enough warmth to make your taste buds glow.  The shrimp are huge and juicy... so the po-boy is pure heaven. I wonder if the oyster po-boy is as good.  The Crab Landry (crab gumbo without rice, and 4 fried shrimp atop garlic bread) is amazing.  Jambalaya was tasty too.  I MUST come back on Friday or Saturday to try the seafood gumbo.   There is plenty of parking.  The dining area and facilities are spotless.   There is no table service.... just a counter.  No frills at all, just fantastic creole comfort food at a great price."}
{"text":"I have been a LONG time Yelp user; however, I am always hesitant to write a review.  Well, Flavors of Louisiana is one of those gems that you just have to tell EVERY one about!!  My hubby and I ordered a wide variety from the menu (fried green tomatoes, seafood gumbo, alligator po boy, joliet dinner) and everything was delicious.  The kids meals were reasonably priced and decent portions.  Our meals had very large portions and they tasted amazing!!  Even though the food was superb, the wonderful service we received was what truly made the meal memorable.  Aaron was our server and was polite, accommodating, prompt and always had a smile on his face.    All in all, we will definitely be back and will spread the word to anyone we can!!  AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to try a new place to eat for dinner tonight and we were not disappointed!! It was seriously all amazing and our waitress Jenna was the best!! We had their hush puppies, gumbo, shrimp po boy, and topped it off with their homemade cheesecake and banana pudding!! Sooooo good!! Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"We absolutely love Flavors!!  Anytime our family visits from Minnesota, we have to go to Flavors of Louisiana for dinner!  Shrimp Po' Boy is a fave along with the dirty rice and fried pickles, which are hand battered!  Their remoulade is second to none and your missing out if you skip the peach cobbler.  What makes it even better is the friendly staff--always attentive and ready to help."}
{"text":"I haven't reviewed Flavors of Louisiana yet? Really?! Well, let me tell you, I've been there a lot of times, and they do it RIGHT. There aren't a lot of tables, but I can't remember ever seeing people waiting for a seat despite a constant flow of traffic in and out of the place. I had their oyster po boy and it was really good. They used a great balance of corn meal to flour (slightly more corn meal, making it crispier and trapping the juiciness inside better). They knew what I meant when I said \"make it dressed with hot sauce.\" The bread almost tasted fried, but it is the best French bread this side of the Mississippi River. The oysters were definitely from the Gulf; it was a fantastic taste of home. I had my 2 girls with me, and I ordered their daily special; fried catfish smothered in shrimp etoufee. I had them serve it separately, and my older girl loved the etoufee, while my younger loved the catfish. I also had their red beans and rice, and that held its own. I wasn't crazy about their rendition of chicken and sausage gumbo, as it wasn't dark enough, but the seafood gumbo was very good. They diced up the holy trinity (celery, onion, bell pepper) to appropriate sizes. A word of warning; the sweet tea is done too sweet for some Southerners and definitely too sweet for most in Phoenix. Get the regular and sweeten it yourself. They could use more drink options (no alcoholic beverages), and they ran out of 2 dishes plus their bread pudding on my last visit, but if you want truly authentic cajun seafood, this is the place to go. It's one of maybe 10 restaurants of ANY kind in the Valley that could survive in New Orleans, and when you're able to do that with non-local seafood, that's pretty darn impressive. Be aware that they're closed on Mondays; I've made the trek to Avondale more than once to discover that I picked the wrong day."}
{"text":"This is like stopping into a joint on Bourbon St., I get transported back to Louisiana when I eat here.  The food is great. You will want to try everything on the menu like we did, but I worn you, there is plenty of food and you will be rolling out the door.  In AZ this is the closet thing I have tried that is like be in NOLA.  Just go, Eat, and you will see for yourself. It's good!"}
{"text":"Great place! I assume the other food is good, but I always get the chicken po boy. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I came here once for the catfish and trust me I'm a catfish snob, this place by far has the best fish in AZ. The closest creole food other than actually being in Louisiana. Got to come try this place out."}
{"text":"No flavor, no spice for being a \"Cajun\" restaurant. They deep fry everything, and what you get is a greasy film in your mouth. I had the sausage po boy it was so over cooked and burned & all you got were a few pieces. I'll stick to Angry Crab where their food is fresh with lots of flavor!"}
{"text":"Rebecca brightened my day as soon as I walked in the door.  Finally found a really good Cajun restaurant in the valley .  Started with the standards - Gumbo followed by coffee (Community Coffee) and beignets!  Powdered sugar on my phone screen as I type this.  Coffee was served with the beignets as they are made fresh to order- no reheats here!  Completely stuffed but already looking forward to my next visit.  Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Worst meal in a long time. Food was obviously reheated & dry, not hot, but lukewarm when served.  Not a good experience.  Would not recommend & not go back.  Way over priced for what we got."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a Cajun restaurant in town so the options are limited.  While heading out of town on a trip to LA I found this place in Yelp so I had to stop. If I had my choice I'd choose Baby Kay's over this place. The food was good but slightly lesser than my other favorite Cajun places. The one thing that was significantly different was the service. It took 15  plus minutes just to get an order of fried pickles and the service from the kitchen was slow on everything else as well. They said they were really busy but it didn't appear to be overly busy. Maybe we were just a little unlucky. Over all good place would have given 4 star if service wasn't so slow."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Good food, lots of good flavor. I don't eat sea food, so I had a chicken po' boy and loved it! Red beans & rice are also on point!"}
{"text":"So I am giving them 4 stars on taste alone. I live in Dallas and have been to a dozen or so cajun places over the years. My complaint is no matter where I go they are overpriced.   This place is priced perfectly for the quality and portions. I had Jouliet Rougue it was very good. It also came with a side salad which was mixed greens not just iceburg.   Their ice tea is good which is not always easy to find. Came in on a Tuesday and service was good. Not to slow and not rushed. I would come back for sure.   I also ordered the beignets. OMG good"}
{"text":"First time going here, it's pretty good! Got the shrimp po boy which the shrimp were cooked to perfection, I would definitely get again the gator is also good too, and the fried pickles were cooked right. Just about everything was better than I expected! I think the only negative was the food came out on the colder side and the price was a tad more, but other than that I say \"not bad\"."}
{"text":"First time here.  I must say I'm impressed .i had the red beans and rice bowl.  Could not eat it all.  Huge serving.  Seasoned very well with Cajun sausage and ham.  I've been to New Orleans many times and this sure reminded me of the food there.  I live in  Las Vegas but I will be a regular at this restaurant every time I visit the area .  These guys do it right !!!"}
{"text":"First time here and won't be the last. Food and service was great. Definitely recommend if you're in the mood for Cajun"}
{"text":"What a GREAT experience! The food was DELICIOUS! The service was superb...in fact Katherine was so great we thought she was the owner...and the atmosphere was so homey and fun we wanted to stay all day! Already picked our food for next Sunday."}
{"text":"It was even crowded at 5 PM !!  Staff was great and food was good.   Hush puppies were just right and I liked the jambalaya.  Lost a star for the Cajun chips, but that might be my issue--dusted chips are just not a thing.  Generous portions  so take a friend and try several things.  Décor is nothing fancy, but the rest is little gem in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered some take out tonight. It was my first visit and was excited to try the food. I ordered shrimp po boy for my wife. I had the crawfish étouffée and a small side order of seafood gumbo.  The food was decent. The seafood gumbo was very salty. Ive been to Louisiana several times and adore Cajun food. This gumbo wasn't right. I liked the étouffée and my wife really enjoyed the po boy.  The restaurant was very busy and for a Saturday night. I think I'll give them another chance to be fair. I'll be hoping its better next time."}
{"text":"Great food! Staff were so friendly and quick with service. Loved this place! The Beignet's are amazing!!! I had a Blackened Chicken Po Boy and the chicken was perfectly cooked and moist. I would definitely come back and eat at this place again."}
{"text":"I love this place. As a native of Louisiana, I find my self craving a taste of home from time to time. The food is consistently delicious. I highly recommend the boudin balls with Cajun tarter sauce and dunkin' catfish. The shrimp po-boy is excellent, as is the gumbo. I used to go when it was more self serve for drinks, but they've renovated a couple of times over the past year and have table service, at least on busy days. I typically call in my order and either bring it home or eat it there. One of the best things about this place is the friendly, kind people who own/work at this restaurant. I'm so happy to find a taste of home so close to where I live now."}
{"text":"Holy cow that was good! Really glad we stopped here instead of trying to go to a salad joint. Shared a catfish Poboy and hush puppies. They were delicious. I only had two poboys in NOLA but this one was better than those. That was unexpected. Also the interior was way cute. I might come here some time for a beignet fix."}
{"text":"Now I'm not a free giver of \"5-Stars\"...it takes something special, which I will get to. I find most places take on authentic Cajun cooking to be nothing but a stereotype of heat and Raggin Cajun's accents. The true taste of the food is lost in hell peppers and fire sauce. Flavors of Louisiana offers something that is vastly superior to this concept, authenticity. Cajun cooking (like most southern area's) is all about taking your time when you cook and not rushing it like most places. The restaurant is a little small nook that is easy to miss unless you are looking for it.   I decided to order the Shrimp Po-Boy and some fries. While I was waiting, the owner was making her rounds talking to the tables and welcoming them, and asking if they needed anything. My food came up quickly and I was out in a dash. The food was amazing. Nice thick cut fries, good taste to the Po-Boy with the most amazing sauce on it. Reading over the menu, there are a lot of dishes I'm eager to try. First time that I've had real honest to goodness Cajun food in a long time.   Now onto the merit for five stars: I was just standing waiting to grab my food and bolt back to my office like a good drone, and the owner asked me why I was just standing around and not relaxing. I explained I was in a bit of rush to get back to work, and she cut me off to say that \"no sane person should ever say that.\" with just a twang of that Louisiana accent.  I just had to laugh because it hit it's mark. She explained that she was sorry to see me go so soon, because she wanted to make sure I liked my food. That banter is what makes this a five star place. Amazing food, good authentic people, and warm inviting environment."}
{"text":"So unique! I have never been to LA but I am thankful that I have a restaurant near but recreating the food. We had Po boys and were in love! So yummy!!"}
{"text":"Best Poboys I've ever had. Their Blackened Aligator Poboy is something out of this world but their Shrimp and Oyster Poboys are just as good. The prices are reasonable but can easily run up a good bill. Worth every penny though!"}
{"text":"Best food I ever, had love the been yeas the shrimp Creole and the shrimp laundry and the fried catfish everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"My first time eating at this place and I loved it! Great service. And the food!! So much flavor in every bite!! I ordered some trio that had some kind of crab pie, gumbo, and jambalaya. It was delicious! I also tried my friends shrimp poboy and it was so good! We had some alligator as well and it was pretty great. Will definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"The food here was good but the service was not the best. We came in on a Friday night and apparently we had a newer waiter that was inexperienced and was a bit slow. He did apologize at the end of the meal and I was thankful for that..   The beignets were super good!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying something new and found Flavors of Louisiana. Yelp said it was open and their website also said they opened at 11am on Sundays. Arrived to find a piece of paper taped to the door with altered hours that they are closed on Sundays. If your website says you're open you should be open- it's not hard to update. I consider that lazy/poor service. Won't be wasting another 20 minute drive any time soon."}
{"text":"After visiting this place afger all the good reviews, it did not disappoint.  First of the french fries were awesome! I know... french fries? Lol they were a twist potatoe wedge style and it was very well seasoned.  cajun cheese fries were kind of disappointing on the cajun part. It didnt have enough cajun seasoning. It felt like regular fries with cheese.   We also ordered the trio and the dunkin catfish. The pie and the jambalaya and the pie was very well seasoned and flavorful, but the seafood gumbo was Very salty!!  Dunkin catfish was very very good! The fish was very tender and the sauce that came with it was just amazing! Thumbs up! Haha"}
{"text":"Thank you Miss Anna for such great service, You truly love what you do and it shows! Dunken Catfish is INCREDIBLE and the Crab Landry is bayou richness to die for!"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly authentic tasting for being in Arizona.. The food came out quick and the service was good so I will definitely be recommending this place to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  A little taste of Louisiana here in the west side of the valley.    I had the Joliet Rouge and it was super Yummy!!!  My daughter had the Crab Landry and it was fabulous too. But the Bread Pudding was my FAVE!!!  It has a little hint of Apple and     YUMMY!   We will be returning"}
{"text":"Pretty good. A nice change of pace but not extraordinary. Food was mildly spiced, a little boring, could have used more zing and complexity. Best was the crawfish pie, sort of a turnover stuffed with crab cake-like mixture. Afraid it might have been pre-frozen? The big problem is if you've ever had the real thing in Cajun country this place was a poor second. Nonetheless it's a good try and something fun if you're looking for a change. Just not overwhelming. Service was very good, BTW."}
{"text":"So glad yelp sent me an alert about this place!!! I got the Dunkin catfish (not so Dunkin because I asked for the catfish on the side) but it was delicious. The house tartar was perfect for the fish. Great portions, great prices! AND they have beignets, great ones at that... We got the order to go and I didn't check it so they did forget my rice for my etouffee and left off a piece of fish as according to the to-go menu, I should have gotten three... but I'm still a fan. If you have a taste for authentic Louisiana dishes, Flavors of Louisiana is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The food was awesomely me. I ordered the dunkin catfish which is fried fish smothered in etuoffee over rice and it did not disappoint. The cheesecake was light and flavorful. Service was friendly and quick. I look forward too trying more on the menu."}
{"text":"We really liked this restaurant. We had a sampling of their Chicken Gumbo, Red Beans, Dirty Rice, Jambalaya and Gator.  Everything was as good as and some better than we've had in Louisiana.  Jenna and the other ladies were incredibly upbeat and very friendly, they made the atmosphere of the restaurant.  We will be back again."}
{"text":"My first time have Cajun food and i wasn't disappointed.  I had the trio..Crawfish Pie, Jambalaya & Shrimp Gumbo."}
{"text":"Very Nice place! I like the service! Very kind cashier! Food was good, I got the chicken sub with rice and beens! My friend guy the same! Their drinks come in a glass container! I will be back if I'm in this area! Good job guys :)"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place after seeing it on Check Please AZ. We got the dunkin catfish, crab Landry and alligator combo. The fried catfish was a bit too salty for me but the crawfish étouffée was pretty good. The alligator came in small pieces like popcorn chicken. Good flavor but wish they did bigger chunks like pappadeux.  The crab Landry was really good. Lots of real crab in it. Their potatoe salad was pretty good and I'm not one to like it usually. Tasted homemade with their own seasonings so flavor was good. Interestingly enough their side salad was good hearty greens and not that iceberg junk so I thought that was impressive that they spend the extra money for it.  Their sweet tea was really good. I don't like mine super sweet and I think they did a good job of that. Even better was that I asked for a to-go cup to pour the rest in and the waiter got me two new cups!  One with ice and one without ice to enjoy later.  Since it was the end of the day they were going to throw the rest away anyways but the fact that he thought to give me one w/o ice for later was ingenious!  When I can't go to Louisiana, this is a great sub to satisfy those cravings."}
{"text":"OMG am I glad I found this place.  Yes, the location is tucked away and hard to find, but once you get there the food is excellent.  If you like Cajon / Louisiana style food then you'll love this place.  This is not your neighborhood Red Lobster...everything you order here is homemade and fresh.  No frozen boxed hush puppies here.  In fact, the hush puppies are the size of cue balls.  Whether you like crawfish, alligator, catfish, oysters, dirty rice, or red beans and rice, it doesn't matter, this place has it all.  Eating here made me feel like I was back home again in Louisiana...the funny thing is that I have never been to Louisiana before in my life.  Its that authentic.  All that is missing is a large screen TV for LSU games!  Go Tigers!  Note:  this place  is not a suit and tie restaurant.  Come in shorts and t-shirt and chow down.  The meals here are very large, so accept the fact you will be coming home with to-go containers which by the way still taste great the following day."}
{"text":"The food is a lil pricy, but you get what you pay for. My wife and I came in and ordered the shrimp Po-Boy and the Étouffée. Seriously, one of the best secrets of the west side of town.   The people are great and the food is perfect!"}
{"text":"Woo what a surprise! This place was awesome. Our waiter was a little goofy, but it was nice to have someone who didn't mind acting like himself. The food was delicious! I had the Blackened Hamburger, which was the perfect level of spiciness! The drinks were fantastic as well. Loved the atmosphere, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place!  We stopped in for dinner tonight and it was great! We started with a mixed appetizer of fried green tomatoes, onion rings and fried pickles.  A hefty dose of fried goodness with the appropriate sauces to match!  It was really hard to choose main courses as everything sounded good but in the end we chose the Dunkin' Catfish and Red Beans and Rice.  Both were delicious and their servings are very decent priced.  You get a lot of food, plus a salad and bread.  Can't wait to come back and see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Okay, the place is no frills, simple, would almost qualify for Triple D... Except, it TASTES good.  We've been to a few Triple D joints and most have been disappointing, making me wonder how much they pay to grab Guy's attention and the publicity.  Flavors of Louisiana brings it!!!!  Flavor, taste, smell, appearance, and portion... All good.  What would make them great?  One thing... Liquor license... so I could have a beer with my fab fish!  Glad I grabbed the 'go' box because I had serious craving the next day. It reheated perfectly and I learned that the flavor was really the ingredients and not over saturation of grease.  Momma loved her Gumbo and appreciated that there were NOT huge slimy chunks of okra in it.  The main man and I had oysters, chicken, and catfish... All worthy of ordering again and again and again.  I enjoyed the tater salad but we both thought the dirty rice could have used more meat in much, much larger pieces.  As it was the meat was so minimal and small it could not be tasted even though I could see it... That, and the lack of beer, were the only down sides to our kickin' Lous-E-anna experience!"}
{"text":"Thank you thank you thank you I've been looking for a place that had authentic style Louisiana Cajun food. Can't wait to try all your items on your menu. The gumbo speechless"}
{"text":"With the loss of Ibby's in the same complex, Flavors has become my go-to spot for a good Catfish Lunch and Fried Okra.  On average, the food is always good and the hospitality is on point.  Always happy to go there."}
{"text":"Wow! Cajun food!!! I am so excited to have found these folks. The young lady who waited on us was very friendly and as attentive as anyone could be. The food was AWESOME. I am a native Texan who is used to some pretty good Cajun food. I've lived in California for the last 30 years and have really missed this southern staple. Recently, the job moved us to Phoenix. Guess this place is my silver lining."}
{"text":"I ordered the Crab Landry and a side of jambalaya while my son had a muffaletta po' boy with fries.  We shared an order of 6 beignets.  The Crab Landry was crab stew with large shrimp and pieces of garlic bread.  It was delicious!  The jambalaya was okay as a side dish.  I'd like to try it as an entree.  My son enjoys a traditional muffaletta and didn't like the lettuce and mayonnaise.  The beignets were good, but could be a bit fluffier.  The restaurant has a mural on one wall that reminds you of boating through the swamps in New Orleans.  One of the waitresses is an opera singer.  We were able to hear her sing Happy Birthday to another guest.  Our waitress was quite pleasant.  We were seated quickly and didn't wait long for food.  She checked on us regularly and made sure we were enjoying our food and our drinks were full.  I'd definitely go back and recommend it to any Cajun food lovers.  I can't wait to try the peach cobbler, banana pudding & cheesecake with praline sauce.  I'm not sure if I missed it but I wish there was bread pudding on the menu."}
{"text":"Love the food and the non-casual atmosphere. A haven for a seafood junky like me :o)"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The the service took more than an hour.... it wasn't even busy. I even saw a couple walk out for taking too damn long."}
{"text":"Came here with our friends and we were all very impressed with their food! Lots of flavor and not too spicy for our friends who can't take too much heat. We started off with their fried green tomatoes and beignets (I just had to have them before our meal). Both did not disappoint, love their sauce! We ordered their Cajun trio and shrimp étouffée. Everything we ordered was delicious! Especially the crawfish pie! Next time I will ask for extra sauce with their crawfish pie.   Everyone was friendly and we're definitely looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I just recently visited NOLA and I'm so excited I found Flavors of Louisiana. I love that I can get alligator here! Sure, it's a tad pricey but Arizona doesn't exactly have local gators so it's very worth it. Everything looks and smells amazing every time I go in, but I just can't stray away from my fried alligator Po'Boy...delicious!!   Also, try the locally brewed Sonoran root beer...it's the perfect beverage for their sandwiches. LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Ms. Jennifer has done it again!!! This is our first time to the Chandler location. We have loved Flavors of Louisiana since she first opened in the West Valley. This location has the same taste and customer service. I'm sure it will be packed soon as others realize there is a second location. Love the Dunkin catfish and the 2 meat combo. My catfish and dirty rice was perfect. We missed our favorite Peach cobbler dessert. You have to get here EARLY for it!! Love you Ms. Jennifer!! God bless this franchise:) love you Dr. Annette and Theodore Smith!"}
{"text":"Yay! We are so impressed! Portions are huge and food is spectacular.. we moved to this side of the valley 2 years ago and have been wanting to try Flavors of Louisiana since we saw the sign. I'm not quite sure what took us so long! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing everything was literally amazing prices on point service is amazing and the food was outstanding I'm from the south and was skeptical because AZ southern food Is never good, but this place was even better than back home HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! We had Alligator po boy cheese Cajun fries fried pickles hush puppies and the Cajun Trio which is gumbo crawfish pie and dirty rice. The Dirty Rice is SOOOOO GOOD ! I could eat that as my whole meal."}
{"text":"Really yummy authentic creole food.Everything was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Flavors of Louisiana 13025 W Rancho Santa Fe Blvd Avondale, AZ 85392  Four of us went for dinner at this venue. We were really looking forward to enjoying some real Cajun/creole food. In many ways we were not disappointed, and in a few ways we were.  We decided to try an assortment of items to get a real picture of the food here. We started out with some fried pickles and fried green tomatoes. Nice and tart with a good breading we were hopeful that it was the start of some great food to come. While some of us ordered soft drinks, two of our party ordered sweet tea. It was true to its name, being a real brewed southern style sweet (emphasis on the sweet) tea.  Next on the try list was Gumbo. They have a seafood gumbo and a chicken and sausage gumbo, both of which we ordered. The seafood gumbo was pronounced excellent by all, but the chicken and sausage gumbo seemed overcooked and the chicken a bit dried out.  Next were main dishes. The shrimp etouffee was wonderful. Flavor was right on and lots of shrimp in it.   The shrimp creole followed the same ideal, with great flavor and good spice in a rich tomato base. Next was a po-boy, the quintessential sandwich of Louisiana. Once again, flavor and fillings were spot on.   Finally, came the Jambalaya, and our big disappointment for the night. Totally dry, with rice that was definitely from the bottom of the pot. We called over our wait person who apologized and said they were running out and had given us the last of the pot. I realize that they wanted to please us by not saying they were out of a particular dish, but in this case I'd have been much happier if they had thrown it out and not tried to serve it.   Though we were getting full, we opted to try the desserts. The peach cobbler was a total winner. Warm with great flavor, it was true comfort food. The cheesecake was just ordinary, and our wait person informed us that it was brought in from an outside vendor.  Finally came the Beignets. I felt that with some chicory coffee I'd be eating in Café du Monde. They were ethereal, and properly covered in huge amount of powdered sugar which promptly got all over everything as it should.  Overall, this was a nice eating experience. Given the one blooper of serving the bottom of the pot, the rest of the meal was spot on in flavors and textures.   The restrooms and the restaurant were nicely clean and service as excellent.  4 stars for flavor, quality of food, service, and cleanliness"}
{"text":"Excellent! As good or better than Baby K's that used to be on Camelback.   Family lunch after church. I had the trio which was awesome- jambalaya, seafood gumbo and crawfish pie with green fried pickle appetizer. Son had a very generously portioned chicken Po Boy, wife had the chicken and sausage gumbo and my daughter had the red beans and rice. Not a trace left on any of our plates and fresh, homemade beignets to top it all off. Closest you'll get to the Quarter this side of the Mississippi.   Service is warm and pleasant. Still getting their cadence/timing and synchronization down but I'm sure they'll hit their groove with more experience."}
{"text":"Well? What can I say about this place? Certainly not what I expected! It was a disappoint since I was really looking forward to some authentic Louisiana Cajun cooking!  The crawfish etouffee lacked taste and a large let down was the hush puppies! I had a couple of them served cold and some where warm. Somewhat concerned that there were hardly any customers for a Friday dinner evening. I have had much better tasting etouffee at other places here in Phoenix and especially in Louisiana!"}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how stoked we are to find this place, but here's to trying!  We ended up stumbling upon this place looking for something new to eat... and boy we are glad we did. We took a trip to NOLA a year and a half ago and I've been missing red beans and rice ever since. Flavors of Louisiana satiated that craving and then some. I had to literally force myself to stop eating to save room for the beignets. Before I knew it my husband had cleaned his plate... and I wasn't far behind him.   The food was very flavorful and seasoned to perfection with appropriate portion sizes. The beignets were the second best I've tried (only to Cafe du Monde) and I am so excited to try the rest of their menu... we are already planning our next visit. Which I am hoping happens sooner than later.  They have Louisiana cuisine done to perfection.   I would offer pictures but our plates were empty before I paused to think about snapping some."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely phenomenal. I came in on a Thursday night and it was pretty quiet. The waitress got us seated right away and took our drink orders. She was very friendly and was happy to offer any suggestions that we wanted. The wife got a sweet tea... after taking a sip of her sweet tea, I caved and got it too. It is absolutely sweet, but the tea flavor is wonderful as well. Most sweet teas that I have had that are this sweet end up masking the tea, but this flavorful jar of deliciousness had it all.  Then the food came... I had the Jambalaya with a side of Red Beans and Rice whereas my wife had the Red Brand and Rice with a side of Jambalaya. There are certainly a couple dishes that really stuck with us from our time in NOLA. It was absolutely delicious! Also, for people that don't handle spice well, no need to worry -- the spice is mild. Now that being said, I love spicy food, but it really did not need the spice. This food was amazing just the way it was.  Lastly, beignets. Yes. Just yes. Not Cafe du Monde's beignets, but the best outside of that. They were fluffy and crisp fresh out of the oven.  We will be back and we will be showing this place to friends."}
{"text":"They have a banquet room available to host parties, functions or special events. The food is absolutely delicious. I've always disliked sea food but let me tell you that I ate all I tried. Wow. That says something. The salad, chicken, jambalaya and fried green tomatoes do not disappoint. Make sure you leave room for dessert the Beignets and banana pudding are awesome!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is terrific and the bread for the sandwiches has been fresh every time I've ordered one. The service is generally friendly, but can be very slow. To give them credit, I think this place has been busier than they expected - they are expanding the restaurant again. Eat here. Order the fried pickles and one of the po boys. Oh the peach cobbler is divine!"}
{"text":"First time my husband and I came in and we tried the blackened shrimp salad and catfish strips w dirty rice. Everything was delicious and quick service. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! Well worth the drive. The service was great too. Even though they were so busy our drinks never got empty. I'd come again. And I've had food in Louisiana several times and this is right on par."}
{"text":"We were so disappointed in our visit here. We were seated right away and our order was taken but after nearly 45 minutes our server came over and asked if we had ordered yet. When we told him he had taken the order already he asked us again what we wanted and never wrote it down. No explanation as to what had happened. We waited another 15 minutes without any food or update so finally let them know we were leaving. So sorry that we didn't get better service or an apology."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is 5 stars.  From the gumbo to the drink serving glasses.  We love taking out of town guests here."}
{"text":"We have had little experience with Cajun food and were delighted to find that there was one in the town we are visiting.  As you walk in, the sound of Cajun music almost makes you want to dance.  Our waiter was very attentive, offered suggestions and delivered great service.  We started off with fried pickles and a Cajun sauce.  Crispy and delicious.  I had the Shrimp Etouffee.  It was delicious.  Lots of shrimp and spices served with a hunk of garlic bread.  My husband ordered the Dunkin Catfish with a Crawfish sauce.  He enjoyed it very much.  So, our first trip into Cajun food convinced us...we need to come back!"}
{"text":"My mom and I drove down from Wickenburg to run a few errands in \"town\".  It was lunchtime and we were hungry. Wanting to stray from the standard, I pulled up trusty Yelp! This restaurant is somewhat hidden, but in a nice strip mall. Having no idea what to expect, we went inside. The girl at the counter was super friendly and gave us great suggestions. We opted to order a few different things and share. We argued the whole meal about what was best part and not a bite was wasted. Delicious. We even opted to order dessert and an extra something to take back to the hubby. Double delicious. Clean, eclectic, and tasty, what else could you want? Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"This was not my first time here, but the first time we ate in since they expanded. It was really good. My husband and I shared an appetizer of fried green tomatoes, which were thick cut, battered and fried to perfection.  We shared the Crab Landry (6\" garlic toasted French bread covered in crab stew topped with 4 fried shrimp)  and an oyster po' boy. The iced tea, we did half sweetened half unsweetened, was perfect too. We finished the meal with some hot beignets covered in powder sugar. They were the perfect end to a great meal. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Dunkin catfish and fried pickles - OMG!!! Better than the spots I've been to in Louisiana!!! This place gets 5 stars, service and food off the hook good!  Dessert - banana pudding and beignets!!!!! Just as good as cafe dumu!!!"}
{"text":"I found this place simply by checking to see what's \"good in the hood\" on foursquare. I am Gluten Free however, my man will go weak at the knees for a good Po'Boy... deciding to make his day I stopped in to get him one and upon walking in I see on the menu board the GF options. (Do you hear the angels singing???) The gal in the front was quick to offer a sample or two and they were delish! My order quickly expanded.   Now keep in mind, I DROVE the food back to Surprise, it was fabulous! I have not had GF food that enjoyable in some time! I absolutely LOVED it! He was thrilled to find there is a decent place to get some of his beloved southern favorites, he thought it was a great Po-Boy and the Gumbo was terrific... The GF fried green tomatoes with the sauce were wonderful and I absolutely enjoyed my GF catfish with the fantastic sauce! I have to say a smile spread clear across my face when the gal announced \"Your order is ready Miss April!\" I LOVE the South! Thank you for bringing that to the Westside! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Continuing on with our United States cross country food tour, we stopped in to this restaurant, even though it was an unlikely location - in a strip mall next to Walmart. We were getting hungry and decided to look at yelp and stop at the nearest four star attraction, this is the first one that came up.   We had the fried green tomatoes and fried dill pickles, along with a sweet tea, cherry coke, the chicken and sausage gumbo 8 oz size over rice, shrimp creole over rice, a garden salad w/ Cajun dressing, the red beans n rice, banana pudding and prepackaged chocolate peanut brittle. Basically just ok - no superstars here, except the hostess/cashier staff who was very welcoming & accommodating, making sure we were comfortable w/ where we were to sit. Nothing exceptional about this food. Best part was fried green tomatoes, red beans n rice & banana pudding for me. Hubby really liked the fried dill pickles & after adding Louisiana Hot Sauce to his shrimp creole, enjoyed that as well. However, my husband is a serial plate scraper & there were at least 4 tablespoons of chow on his plate, so you be the judge!!!  I've certainly waited longer for food, but it's just not that busy in here & let's be honest, they are just plating food, not making it fresh. Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure it was the waitress, who was really nice but not super attentive. Had to be flagged down for the bill.   Prices weren't awful, but a lower price point would be appropriate for the quality of food we were served - see photo of receipt attached."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic food. They even have a couple unusual choices that are perfect for a Cajun restaurant. Order at the counter and then wait at a table for your food. Indoor and outdoor seating available. It seems to be a favorite of military personnel and the red hatters, who were dining at the same time as us."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! The service was great and the food was even better!! Loved the family and very friendly environment! We will definitely be back for another PoBoy and desserts!"}
{"text":"Good down home Louisiana cooking.... They have 2 different types of batter as well as a Low salt batter! reasonably priced.   fish and chips gumbo's of all types. Big Menu! DONT FORGET TO TRY THE GATOR BITES!    Delicious!    check it out.."}
{"text":"I've been to New Orleans and this is the only place I've been to since that even comes close. We tried so many things so I won't go into detail about all of it, but EVERYTHING was delicious and flavorful. Also, get the banana pudding for sure."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the service. Was a strange smell to the place but they serve alligator so I guess that's to be expected. Staff was super friendly.   I got the trio which was seafood gumbo, jambalaya and a crawfish pie with a side of the strangest looking but tastiest fries I have ever had.  Crawfish pie crust was amazing.  If you order the fries you only need 1 order for 2 people, It's rather large. I'll definitely be returning multiple times. Forgot to take any pictures because I was too busy enjoying, maybe next time"}
{"text":"So my wife and I finally got the opportunity to stop in and have dinner here. Needless to say, we were not dissappointed. she and I are from the south and we know how hard it is to find good southern flavors here in the west valley. We knew as soon as we tried the sweet tea that we were in for a treat.  You see, sweet tea is simple but you got to do it right. Every place we go to here that \"try's\" sweet tea don't get it right. This place does. Anyhow, she had the jambalaya, gumbo and this crab pie thing. I had étouffée on cat fish with dirty rice. It was awesome!  The only thing that I personally didn't care for was the fried green tomatoes. With that said, being from the south, I'm used to having mine fried in a pan and not a deep fryer. I will say they were okay though.   Anyhow, 5 stars from this southern boy and his southern girl! Oh and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. There were a lot of people there but when we were finshed with our meal the check seemed to take an extra amount of time. We will be back to try something else. Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing."}
{"text":"I ordered gumbo and shrimpo po boy lunch combo.  Food took a while to be served, and fountain machine was being serviced.  There was too much mayo in my po boy, and the gumbo was too salty for my liking.  Louisianna food is probably as good as it gets here in Arizona. My colleague ordered rice & beans, and that was better than the gumbo but still too salty. Overall, if you're looking for this cuisine in Phoenix, stick to the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious and authentic. The place has a fun ambience as well. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! And service is even better. My husband got the crab Landry. So delicious! I ordered something with Juliet in the name.. I'm sorry, I can't remember the exact name but I could eat it every day of my life. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"SOOOO good!!!! Couple of us grabbed dinner there last Saturday and I was blown away, its hard to find real CAJUN and CREOLE and this place was legit Had so many things from fired green tomatoes best I have had since Memphis Tennessee, Gumbo was amazing and it was my first time trying boudin balls and now I am hooked!. And the fried alligator well we ordered a pound to go, its that good!"}
{"text":"Beginning: We were headed to Ibby's Fried Fish for the 1st time. Unfortunately (maybe not), They had a D.O.H paper taped on the door. Their business is closed!   Mom and I were hungry and looking to satisfy our seafood craving. While leaving the plaza we saw \"Flavors of Louisiana\".... We both looked at each-other like \"should we do it\". Never been there before either. So, we did it!   As soon as you walk in there's an empty- cold feel to the place. We probably would've left immediately if there wasn't 3 occupied tables.   We read the wall menu. Grabbed a to-go menu. Then, decided to just dine-in.   Mom was SO bummed there was no greens or yams.   I ordered the 12 oz. Seafood Gumbo. There was 2 large oysters, 3 med/small shrimp, crab flecks & a river of broth. I asked for extra rice to fill the void. I also ordered 1 pieces of catfish. The waitress was really nice. She gave me 2!   Mom ordered the catfish combo. It comes with catfish & one (1) side. Now, the to-go menu says it comes with a Cajun roll (which we didn't get).  They put moms catfish & my catfish ALL IN ONE BASKET for us to share (because it's my mom- i didn't care... but someone else?).  If you notice, there's a trend while reading their reviews. COLD! The food is cold, cold, cold. I don't know why? Although, some of the catfish was fairly hot.   The girl who served us was very over worked. She waited, cooked, bused. I mean, i can see why she would be a little short AND SHE WASN'T.   The crowd here is friendly/social. There was a guy who sat across from us who shared his beignets w/ us & THAT was awesome!   The remaining staff (popped out of no where) were very nice, as they wished us a great evening.   All & all this place just needs a few tweaks & it could/ potentially be stellar!! However, as of today. I'm struggling to give it even two stars."}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying that the Catfish is delicious,  well seasoned and well fried. The sweet tea was not bad either.  But let's get to the entree. So we ordered an array of dishes , the place is new and we wanted to really get a good sense of their flavors. So we ordered the Dunkin Catfish, the Shrimp Ettouffee,  and the Cajun Trio. With a side order of the chicken and sausage gumbo.  So let me also point out that my family is from the south. New Orleans, to be exact. I was just there visiting last month.  So basically the crawfish Ettouffee tasted burnt, with extra salt to cover the flavor. The gravy itself was an orange color.  The gumbo was greasy with no flavor of gumbo, and it was served without rice. I get it , it's a new place and there is definitely room for growth. But the service was great. Very friendly and Clean environment.  Which i very much appreciate. So while I may not order the gumbo or Ettouffee again. I would def still get the fried catfish!"}
{"text":"My pops and I both tried the Crab Landry as we had never heard of it and sounded good. The dish was amazing...the shrimp were nice sized and fresh and the crab stew had great flavor with a mild heat."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I popped in for a bite while on business travel and I'm glad I did! The hostess was very kind, sweet and accommodating! For a weary business traveler, her attitude was a breath of fresh air!  I wanted some gumbo and a po' boy and she recommended the perfect pairing, the chicken gumbo with a muffuletta.  Over hearing that another table also got beignets, I asked her to add that to the order, too. I've had all of these items in NOLA, but these were as good or better than I've had before.  The food was outstanding, but when I got to the hotel I realized I didn't have any cutlery... My fault probably but a reminder would have been nice."}
{"text":"Alligator poboy is my go to! Fast friendly and fresh! And Mustard is fantastic! I will be going back!"}
{"text":"went again last nite - had to order the hush puppies...sooo good!  but watch out they're filling. the po boys are standard favs among us but we've tried the creole and etouffee and landry - all good.  nice waitresses too.  also remember they are closed on Sundays and don't serve drinks."}
{"text":"As a big fan of Creole cooking, I was very satisfied with this restaurant. I had the combo plate ( gumbo, jambalaya, crawfish pie, side of potato salad). All items were delicious and fresh. Service was great. General Manager came by each table which was a nice touch. Will definitely come back. Note: as of this writing, they have not received their liquor license yet, as they have just recently opened."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authenic Southern Louisiana cooking in the phoenix area then this is the place to go.  I know it is far drive for a majority of the residents in the valley, but I have to admit it's really worth it.  Located in Avondale right off I-10 in another strip mall like everything else in this metro area is a place for cajun lovers.  The po-boy sandwiches are great and you can choose to have a variety of meat on them such as shrimp, oysters, catfish, crawfish, tilapia, or alligator(I know I just said alligator).   The flavors with spices come together to make a great feast and are not to spicy as true cajun food is not supposed to be to hot over powering the meal.  Not to forget their chicken and gumbo soup.  What a flavorful delight this is!  I highly recommend trying some gumbo while here.  The atmosphere here is somewhat boring looking somewhat like a fast food cafeteria.  The highlight is a wall dedicated for LSU fans with purple and gold as I'm sure the owners are showing off some of their roots.  Prices are average as one person will spend between $9 and $12 which I feel is totally worth it.  I don't frequent this part of town, but when I'm in the area again or on my way to a spring training game in Goodyear I just might have to stop by.  This place is great for anyone wanting to try cajun food for the first time or for the southern style connesiour."}
{"text":"Well, I've been back four more times as I like the owners, they are very nice and are really trying their best. As I said before, some of the food is very good but other dishes are still lacking (see review from 6/20). Unfortunately, they are so busy on weekends, the attention to details goes by the wayside. Rice is luke-warm and mushy, red beans and Rice Bowl with sausage is dry and sausage, although abundant is overcooked/dry. The side salad is wilted, shredded cheese is melted and stuck together and there are 2 very tiny slivers of a cherry tomato buried at the bottom. It really seems that the main dish chefs are very good while others in the kitchen are just going through the motions which is really too bad as it has the makings to be an excellent restaurant. I will continue to go and enjoy the dishes that they do best and hope that they continue to move in the right direction."}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5.  I'm actually really surprised about the 4 out of 5 rating it has on yelp.  I got the blackened catfish with shrimp/crawfish étouffée sauce on top and dirty rice, which comes with a side salad and garlic bread. $15.95. The étouffée sauce was okay, not too much seasoning, could be a little more seasoned. I feel like it wasn't salty enough. The catfish was ehhh, a little on the rubbery side. The side salad was blah. They use ice burg lettuce with some chopped tomatoes and some sprinkled cheese. I'm not a fan of ice burg lettuce (it's the most inexpensive, and has no nutritional value). I think I'd be happier if they used spring mix or romaine lettuce. The cajun ranch dressing was really good, though. Garlic bread was ehhh... wish it was more toasty and not somewhat chewy.  My husband got the trio: jambalaya, crawfish pie, and gumbo. Around $10-$11. The jambalaya was moist and decent. Crawfish pie was REALLY good. We both enjoyed that a lot. The gumbo was decent, but not the best. It was really broth-y and did not have a lot of stuff in it. Flavor was decent. My friend from Louisiana makes much better gumbo soup than here.  I would give the crawfish pie a 4.5 out of 5. The gumbo would be a 3 out of 5. Everything else would be no more than a 3 out of 5.  The reason I give this place a 2.5 out of 5 is because of the atmosphere and setting. It feels a little dirty and it doesn't feel or look like a restaurant. The music they were playing was loud, obnoxious, in spanish? and didn't feel like it was a great match for cajun food. If they improved in these atmosphere flaws, I would probably give a 3.0 out of 5.   Service was good (family-owned).  Would I go here again? Only for the crawfish pie, but that's all. You can find similar, but much BETTER food for similar prices at Pappadeaux."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my husband. The food was good. It's a small location (or the side they had opened). A lot of people had to wait for tables to be cleared before sitting or they just sat at a unclean table until it was cleared up. (The fix here would be to maybe have one person who was solely responsible for clearing tables only- rather than having the person also run the register, refill drinks, occasionally bring food out).  The food was good but the best part to us was the beignets. They were fresh, warm, and just amazing! We'd absolutely return here again."}
{"text":"We have been to New Orleans often and love the food. This restaurant brings that same food and flavor to AZ. Very good food. We tried the oyster po'boy with seafood gumbo on the side and the red beans and rice bowl, which came with a side salad. Service and other staff was attentive and friendly. A must try."}
{"text":"Could do without the politics; but I love the Red Beans & Rice.  I'm glad they're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great food! Being from Louisiana, I finally found a local spot with the right taste.  its about time!"}
{"text":"Pricey. We went for lunch. Had chicken strips and wife had shrimp basket (3 Shrimp), hush puppies and sodas. Our bill was $32. Food was good."}
{"text":"I love love this place!  The etoffeè is amazing.  It's a little weird ordering at the counter but maybe they save money on the waitstaff so I'm cool with it."}
{"text":"Me and my wife (both chefs) stopped in for a date night.  We wanted something a little different and not from a chain restaurant.  We started off with fried pickles, my wife is a huge fan of pickles but, gasp, had never had them fried.  They were an amazing start to our meal.  She chose a muffaletta with cajun chips for her entree.  The chips with cut thick, which is rare to find, but delicious.  The meat on the sandwich was great and the actual mix was so good, I could have eaten it on damn near anything.  I had the two meat plate with alligator and shrimp, the alligator had good flavor but was a little bit chewy.  The shrimp were perfect; not too much breading and cooked perfectly.   The staff was so friendly and explained all of their sauces and were everything you would want from food service staff.  The plus about it is the fact that it is a locally owned, family owned restaurant.  We're already spreading the word."}
{"text":"The po boys were the best! Catfish and shrimp po boys are recommended! The jambalaya on Monday's are great that was a small portion but still good! The chicken strips also a great choice!"}
{"text":"I need to qualify my review with the fact that I did not eat there, that does not mean that l did not try, my experience mirrors that of many others. At 630 on a Thursday night l foung 8 patrons inside, 2 eating.... 4 at various tables nursing their 3rd refils of self service pop... 2 lonely souls standing in line at an unoccupied register. when l querried the people in line as to how long they had been there and how long it had been since they had seen a live employee they replied \"more than 5 minutes\" l put my menu down and drove the 5 minutes to Raul and Teresa's on Litchfield road and had a great meal"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 if I could. They are in need of more servers as there was only one on Friday at 5pm. It took 20 minutes for her to come over and take our order. That was a huge deal breaker for us. The food wasn't bad but wasn't worth the price for the quality. They give you this freezer crisp cut fries. Other than that I would eat her but order to go and ahead."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, amazing portions.. try anything on the menu and you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Cajun food, so I was really excited to try this.  Our server was great, she was very attentive and gave some suggestions. I certainly liked the no frills atmosphere.  The food that we had was very good, but a couple of items weren't very hot (temperature).  We had Cajun cheese fries as an appetizer that were just ok.  The cheese on top was melted, but the shredded cheese in between the layers wasn't melted at all.  My wife had the Cajun trio - gumbo was decent, jambalaya was better and the crawfish pie was very good.  The only downside was that it wasn't very hot, which made me wonder if our food had been reheated.  I had the 12\" fried gator po'boy and it was excellent across the board. I had red beans and rice as a side and liked them as well.  Overall opinion - we will definitely be back, the service was good and the food was great, but just the preparation/timing of it needed to be tweaked. Hard to find good Cajun food in the southeast valley and I really want to see this restaurant succeed."}
{"text":"Definitely the best shrimp po boy I've ever had. The bread and sauce really make the sandwich. My husband has tried several other things on the menu and said they were good, but not as good as the po boys!"}
{"text":"My second visit to FofL was somewhat disappointing.  Service was slow and food was disappointing.  There were definitely more diners there on the second visit but apparently not any increase in kitchen or wait staff because it took almost 30 minutes to get our food once it was ordered (and it took extra minutes for the wait staff to take our order as well).  My earlier review was 5 stars so I tried one of their Po Boy sandwiches this time instead of the Jambalaya and Gumbo and it was very disappointing.  I was expecting something more than a Subway sandwich for $12 but that is exactly what I got.  A giant sausage on a nondescript roll with a standard tomato slice and lettuce.  Although it was a good sandwich it was very expensive and did not stand out.  One of my other diners also ordered a Po Boy and was equally disappointed.  Of the other three diners in our party two stuck with food they had tasted in a previous visit and were not disappointed but the third one was.  I don't recall what she had but it seemed to be some sort of shrimp on rice dish.  If I go again I will stick to the Jambalaya and Gumbo dishes I enjoyed so much.  Oh, and the fried pickles are a treat as are the beignets for dessert."}
{"text":"Best cajun ever had.....seriously almost licked plate clean!! Such a great dinner I cannot convey how amazing the food is you just have to see for yourself!! Will not be disappointed checking out this restaurant :-)"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place because I've heard great things about the one in Glendale. However, this place's main problem is it's being run very poorly so far. As to not make this review five pages long, I will just say that the service was one of the worst I've experienced. Our server didn't refill drinks, Brought out the food for 1/2 of the table and then it took 15 minutes for the second half to get their food, and the kids corn dog came out dead last about 20 minutes after everybody else. Items that we ordered were not brought out and when we brought it to the managers attention he didn't seem to care very much, and never checked back with us to see if we were happy. As for the food a lot of it was overcooked. we got some fried crawfish that were cooked so much that the crawfish was just dried and shriveled bits, the gumbo tasted burned and didn't have a lot of stuff in it, mainly just broth. I hope the owner can whip this location into shape because I would love for it to get better so that I can go back and experience what it was supposed to be."}
{"text":"YUM! As someone who has been to NOLA, what a treat to not have to buy a plane ticket every time I crave a bite to eat! Highly recommend the chicken gumbo and  jambalaya! Lastly, as a teacher I love eating at an establishment that employs teachers and supports them!!! Thanks for great meals time after time."}
{"text":"Came in on on Friday night in September. I really wanted some good food and the full parking lot reassured that I made the right choice.   Sat down within 3 minutes, ordered food within 10 more minutes. Waited an HOUR for our food to come out!  I ordered the 6\" Shrimp Po Boy with dirty rice. Mom ordered the 6\" Catfish Po Boy with Red Beans and Rice. A lemonade (yuck) and half order of Fried Green Tomatoes to go along.   Bottom line:  Atmosphere : 2 stars Food: 5 stars Service: 4 stars  Will be back to try something else and a dessert."}
{"text":"Came in with high hopes of some good crawfish.  Left with disappointment. Crawfish has very little flavor and no juice. The bowl of red beans and rice comes with a fork..really.  The owner came by to remove the unfinished food, and asked how was it?  She shrugged her shoulders and walked away after I told her the crawfish is over cooked. The tail meat was sticking to the shell.   It would have been nice if they served beer. At least I could of wash that crap down."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something different and unique and came across this place. They serve shrimp, crawfish and alligator amongst other things.  So I decided to do something in the middle. I chose the 6\" Crawfish po boy sandwich. Came with lettuce, tomatoes and a special sauce. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8Vpfy_WtcVvZS8Wfz7JQJA?select=mB5BltElI3XPFBiM7gH4eg Despite having this sauce on the sandwich, the crawfish was a bit dry, but some Louisiana hot sauce fixed that. The bread was thick and crispy too.  From my understanding, after talking with a couple of Louisana folks, that \"po boys\" are usually pretty cheap. But my 6\" sandwich was $10 and that's a little bit higher than usual.  For my side, I upgraded with a $1 more, and got a small cup of chicken and sausage gumbo. Very hot and spicy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8Vpfy_WtcVvZS8Wfz7JQJA?select=O1O8644v0j73kL-7e5C73Q Great stuff. I should have ate this concurrently with the sandwich instead of eating the soup first. The sandwich could have tasted better if I dipped it directly into the gumbo, who knows.  I also tried a big bottle of Sonoran root beer. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8Vpfy_WtcVvZS8Wfz7JQJA?select=hgSfK9VzLLuKS4WKpiC15A Very refreshing Arizona root beer. I liked their bottle label too. Cool stuff.  So if you want to try something different, this place has several choices for you. The prices are slightly elevated but give it a shot."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm mazing... Fried alligator po boy! Best service! Staff is friendly! Great environment! I love it!"}
{"text":"This place has great comfort food! The service is a little slow but other than that it's definitely worth trying out. If you're ever in the area make sure you stop by and try the pecan praline cheesecake!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm no expert on cajun food, at all.  To be completely honest the only experience I've had are through Anthony bourdain on the travel channel and a botched birthday meal at papa deaux.  After stumbling upon this place on yelp while at work, it was all I could do to not call out for the rest of the day and satisfy my craving for dirty rice right then.  When I did get off I grabbed my hubby and drove all the way to Avondale.  He ordered the sausage po boy, with cajun chips and cole slaw, and I had the Friday special, it was shrimp in a gravy over rice, dirty for me, I have no idea what it was called.  The shrimp was amazing, the spicy smoky flavors over the dirty the dirty rice hit the spot.  ITs a good thing mine was so good or my fiancé would have had to fight me for his po boy, that sausage was to die for.  I love the cole slaw, but thought the chips were so so, He loved the chips and thought the cole slaw was so so.  The employees were friendly the prices were good.  The decor was... colorful...  Overall, big fan.  P.S. Beer would be nice."}
{"text":"Great place, reminded me of my aunts food who grew up in Louisiana.  I had the jambalaya and it was soooooo sooooo good.  Husband had the aligator and ate it all.  We will be coming by again."}
{"text":"Cute place, the concrete floors are stained/painted(?) hues of blues and tans giving it the appearance of water. They painted a mural of swamp trees on the walls as well. Very cool!  Seems to be run by young people who surprisingly also know the meaning of customer service. The moment you walk in you are greeted and treated warmly. Not asked what you want while starring at their cell phones.  I ordered the Drunkin' Catfish which is cornmeal fried catfish with Ettoufee on top. If you scan their photos you'll find it pictured. There was no lack of crawfish in their Ettoufee. The catfish had a nice crunch from the cornmeal. I love that! I love Cajun and Creole food, however I don't eat fried food as much, so it did end up a tad rich for me.  I was happy to see they are earth friendly minded because the takeout container that my dinner came in was reusable plastic. I know these aren't cheap so it's much appreciated. Wish more restaurants would change from styro take out boxes that take 50 years to breakdown in our landfills.  Flavors of Lousiana does a nice job and I'll be back again to try more!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of Cajun but the catfish po-boy was good. Lots of people there tho...so must be all right. Had fried green tomatoes and fried pickles."}
{"text":"I'm not a Cajun food expert, by any means. But I do know good food and good service. Don't expect anything fancy. Decor is tired and uninspiring. Bite into your meal and you'll forget about the surroundings. I've never had a bad meal here.   Prices are not cheap. But quality food seldom is. And you'll have enough leftovers for another meal the next day. Portions are HUGE!  Tricky to find, lousy curb appeal, tacky interior. This place has nothing going for it, except a meal that will have you returning again and again."}
{"text":"I only had the fried green tomatoes. The flavor was excellent but the tomatoes were sliced real thin so I mostly had breading."}
{"text":"Okay we went and tried out this restaurant due to the reviews.  Ordered the PO Boy, gumbo, beans and rice, and the catfish basket, had to wait five minutes to get some silverware, so we just sat there looking at each other until we flagged down the waiter.   -  Let's start with he PO Boy it was okay, same as Popeyes.   -  The gumbo ick, ick ick, it was nothing but rice with pieces of chicken which looked liked Vienna sausages, had to pull out the iPhone flashlight to make sure, this gumbo was watered down, no flavor and after a spoonful we left it alone.  Nothing worst than listening to other customers saying the same thing we said \"i make better gumbo than this\".   - The catfish basket, man o man you got to nail the fries, nothing worst than cold fries, the catfish strips same you get at safeway  The kicker is when you ask your customer how was the food and you look down and see all the food still on the plate, than you should know.  -  I don't think this place is gonna last, Forty bucks for soupy rice, two strips of catfish, a sandwich, i'm so glad we had trident gum to try and erase the flavorless food from our mouth. \"It didn't deserve a picture\" trust me..."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in the valley. This place has such delicious food..I often order the Oyster Po'boy...it NEVER fails to please. But if you are fortunate enough to be there for the crab stew special, snatch it up before they run out! It is so amazing...rich and delicious. My mom would be happy to come and eat just the fried green tomatoes. They are as good as my gramma's! (never tell her I said that)   Then there is the staff....the place is family owned and operated and it shows. In all the best ways...they are happy and polite and they let me try some things before I ordered the first time...I tested the fried pickles, the green tomatoes , and even the crab stew! I then bought them all lol so it's a smart thing they let me try them and get hooked.   Come and feel at home and eat an amazing southern meal like no other. I can't wait to go back! The only thing that keeps me from going is my empty wallet....but they are worth every cent."}
{"text":"I've been here once.  And that one time I got food poisoning.  Would give it one more try to see if it gets better."}
{"text":"Love it. Ladies are golden to deal with. Food is really light for being fried. I will go again."}
{"text":"This was our second visit, the first was  about a year ago (?). I'd loved the crab Landry and sweet tea and trying to come back for it again.   Finally made it in today, ordered the crab Landry, fried pickles,  onion rings , fresh salad and jambalaya. The crab Landry was good as I'd remembered , tho needed a bit of salt and hot sauce . The fried pickles dipped in Cajun ranch were a treat.   We give 4 stars instead of 5 cuz the jambalaya was dry. Our waitress came to check on us and when we hesitated she asked if it was dry and offered to bring a cup of their gumbo sauce. That did help somewhat.  Their sweet tea was perfect and she kept us refilled with a new full cup to take home .  Hoping to make it out again soon to introduce some relatives to FOL.  Looking forward to it"}
{"text":"Ok I have eaten here a few times. Never had anything I didn't like. I like Cajun food, so, I like this food. As for some of the bad reviews saying this isn't real Cajun, or drive to the Bible Belt, to get \"real\" Cajun food?! Seriously!! That's why they are so good and popular here! You don't have to drive a couple thousand miles to get good Cajun food."}
{"text":"I never considered coming here until I saw the restaurant featured on an episode of Check Please Arizona. I had a bunch of family in town, very picky eaters, and the menu online made this look like a good option. It was! We were all really impressed.  The atmosphere is very homey. It's basic, and the tables have a lot of space so that even with the open floor plan, we didn't feel squished. Service was top notch, too.  We had the hush puppies as an appetizer. Like whoa. This are awesome, definitely up there with the ones I've had at the Fish House in Conway, Arkansas. Flavors of Louisiana servers them up with little sealed pats of butter, which I hadn't seen before, but worked out really well.  I ordered the blackened shrimp salad. They use mixed greens (yay!) with a full variety of flavors and textures. The shrimp is packed with flavor. I had the balsamic vinaigrette and that worked out really well. My mom had the salad with blackened chicken and loved hers, too. She had to take half of her chicken home.  My brother tried the shrimp etouffee. He'd never had it before but enjoyed everything from the sauce to the garlic bread served alongside.  My dad went traditional and had the three catfish strips with potato salad. I tried a bit of his catfish--awesome! Perfect crispiness with a nice, light batter. He had a sweet tea.  My son, who has autism and only eats chips in restaurants, had their Cajun chips. He loved them. The chips are very thick, crisp, and fresh, and the flavor has a mild kick. We brought about half home and they kept well into the next day.  My folks are already saying they must eat at Flavors of Louisiana when they visit next, and I'm looking forward to becoming more of a regular there with my husband."}
{"text":"I ordered the catfish po'boy, chicken gumbo, and the red beans and rice... the po'boy was pretty good while the gumbo was ok at best, i will never recommend the red beans and rice. Not the greatest place but i will revisit for the alligator po'boy and sea food gumbo, so far i am unimpressed but i'll go here before i drive all over the valley to get my cajun fix... i just hope the second time will be better"}
{"text":"Catfish, shrimp, red beans n rice were all great as usual. Always a pleasant time eating here."}
{"text":"We're a big fan of the food here. We always get hushpuppies for an appetizer -- best we've had in the valley. The main dishes are great as well, especially the Crab Landry. If they have bread pudding on the menu when you are there, save room!   Our only complaint is that there's no table service for lunch. The line can get ridiculous, especially when people don't know the menu. For the prices, we'd prefer an actual waiter or waitress checking on us from time to time."}
{"text":"It is so hard to find good southern food in this town. So far I have had the shrimp etoufee and and shrimp po'boys. There is nothing fancy about this place, however the food is amazing. Located in of course, a strip mall, next to LA Fitness. Somewhat hard to see, but definetly worth checking out. The prices are great too. Everything is under $10. Their menu has catfish, shrimp, chicken and a few other things. This is just a mom & pop little place which is awesome. I hope this place sticks around."}
{"text":"Takes forever to get your food but we ordered the gumbo and it was amazing! Atmosphere isn't elegant but it isn't awful. Small and quaint. It was clean when we went there. Customer service was superb! I have since learned that I can make some amazing gumbo so I am not sure we have a need to go back, but maybe we will go to check out some new foods one day."}
{"text":"I truly loved this place is not huge but still has that New Orleans vibe plus the food is very good. I had the catfish with a side of fries and it was very tasty"}
{"text":"FINALLY!!  I have wanted to eat here for almost four years. Doug and I ordered fried catfish and shrimp baskets and fries and it was delicious. The service was very friendly and we think this is our new 'place'. Next time will be dinner. We had cheesecake with praline sauce for desert. It was massive. I took a picture but we were finished, ha!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty spacious.  All of the staff were extremely welcoming and customer oriented. The jambalaya was delicious but seemed a bit dry for my taste.   I did not order any alcohol but Flavors of Louisiana does offer alcoholic beverages. They had a pretty decent beer selection from what I recall. Additionally they offered wine selections.   The special sides cost just $1 and they give you an adequate amount of food.   This is definitely a restaurant I'd go back to!"}
{"text":"Always looking for some place worth riding to  and we have definitely found one. We had the great pleasure of splitting a 12-inch shrimp po' boy that was better than any I had in New Orleans. The shrimp were lightly battered and fried to golden perfection (no stale oil here) and covered the slightly crusty roll with a perfect amount of sauce. This was no imitation of a po' boy, just something done simply but really well. The red beans and rice were spot on as well, perfectly salted and seasoned. The service was terrific, the order came split from the kitchen, there was no attitude or having to ask for an extra plate.  When it came time for dessert- a generous serving of peach cobbler a la mode- had to be tried. It was a little sweet for my taste, but hub loved it. And total bill for this scrumptious little meal plus three drinks? $21. We will be back any time we are on that side of time. I see future rides in our future,"}
{"text":"This is my first visit to Flavors of Louisiana and it was great! I don't write reviews ever...but if your looking for a great Po'boy, this is the only spot in the Phoenix area.   The decor is a bit of like an office setting with decorations to highlight the streets of old Louisiana. But who cares?! The food is great!  The beignets were okay, but then again I wouldn't trust me since I have never been to New Orleans to try the real beignets.  You have everything to loose if you don't try these awesome Po'boys they make. Arizona is really scarce with places that serve really good tasting dishes, and FOL really restores my lifeless tastebuds. #DOIT"}
{"text":"You know the food is good when they are jam packed at 6:00 on a Friday night. I always get the oyster po' boy and it's perfect! We also love the fried green tomatoes."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch here today. The food is LEGIT Cajun/Creole. It is just like eating in Louisiana where I have been many times. Hope they open in the east Valley soon!"}
{"text":"After hour and a half waiting for food we decided to leave. Don't waste your time at this place. The staff is unprofessional and still trying to learn how to take orders. At one stage when we complained to the waitress that we have been waiting for an hour and haven't even seen the appetizers, her reply \"that's the way it is.\""}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I been trying to get my fiancé to come here so we could try it for a while and he is loving it just like me!! I definitely recommend to ANYONE! Great chef!"}
{"text":"I am surprised by the high reviews.  My and my girlfriend's food was disappointing.  For folks that don't know better, this restaurant apparently passes for good Creole or Cajun.  They wouldn't make it in the Big Easy."}
{"text":"Yelp helped us find this little gem on our way out to California.  After visiting NOLA in December, I was missing the po boys and red beans and rice.   This is what I was needing.  Restaurant is clean, simply decorated with some NOLA pictures, masquerade masks, beads.  There is also a swamp mural with a faux shack on one wall.  Tables are kindof picnic style with the vinyl/cloth back tablecloth.  Service is exceptional, down-home and friendly.  They truly aim to please and show consideration.  Food...   Shrimp Po Boy.  We ordered a half size expecting to share... my poor husband only got a couple bites.  Don't waste your time on the half sized portion, go big and get the 12\".  Packed full of lightly battered/coated shrimp.  The remoulade was spectacular and gave it a punch that made your mouth water for more.  The baguette was delicious as well (I'm still wondering where they get it.)  We also ordered the red beans and rice plate and it had sausage in it.  Very good... but we only now get po boys here... we're pretty much stuck on them.    My only problem I have with this restaurant is that they are 45 minutes away from me.   Boo! :("}
{"text":"Always would stop by the Avondale location on our way to or from Cali.  Loved their food, love the hospitality.  The Chandler location doesn't fall short!    Had the appetizer platter.  Fried pickles were so good!  My sis got the fried catfish with the crawfish sauce on top.  The fish was fried but not greasy, light and fluffy.    I had the shrimp PO boy.  Oh man - the new bread is soooooo good!  Real legit New Orleans bread.    Red beans and rice as a side and It was the perfect last meal before my diet!"}
{"text":"Had this please bookmark and was looking for an excuse to cheat on my normal lunch meal. The location is at the end of the strip mall near the Brunswick bowling but you can easily see the sign as you're driving west on Chandler Boulevard.  When you walk in your quickly greeted by the staff that has a large chalkboard style menu on the wall and you're escorted into the main dining room area.  Based on the layout you can quickly tell that a liquor license is coming which will make the experience really great as there's plenty of space and a nice vibe.  Our server was prompt knowledgeable and courteous to our group and it was the same thing with the others that were in there working as everyone seem to be very positive.   There is a lunch menu but it's not very extensive so feel free to pick something off the main course side if you want. Today I personally went with the catfish strip basket while my buddy went with the tilapia basket & the adventurous one decided to venture with a Po'Boy alligator sandwich. He asked what a Po'Boy was and I was about to revoke his southern card... so I gave him a pass :-)!! Haha. I hesitated on getting one as I've been to places and they give you more bread lettuce and sides then they do the meat.   Totally not the case for his Po'Boy sandwich today as it was stuffed from end to end... surprisingly it comes in a 6 inch or 12 inch.   Catfish strips were pretty big & come with the side sauce and french fries that are cut almost like a helicopter-style cut along with a roll and butter. The gator Po'Boy came with hush puppies on the side.  When done, everybody cleared their plates and it was just the right amount of food. We stuck around catching up for about 30mins after eating. Our server kept the sweet tea & water flowing as needed and we definitely look forward to coming back to get a Po'Boy!"}
{"text":"This is bar-none our favorite place to eat in the Goodyear/Avondale area.  The food is great! If you are afraid to eat spicy food, don't worry! Many selections from the menu are not hot. This is authentic \"Nawlins\" eating! The stereotype that Cajun is hot food is not true. It is well seasoned. Garlicy, sweet, sour, hot, salty. The gamut of flavors depending on what you order.  Everything is fresh and delicious. I have had the fried pickles, hush puppies, red beans and rice, shrimp creole and the shrimp Étouffée. My friends had the Po boys made with gator. All of it was fantastic.  The service is great, except for one time the staff was busy with a large birthday party and kinda forgot about us. However, as soon as they realized what was happening, they were very attentive. Otherwise, nice food servers who know the menu and can recommend with authority.  Order the Beignets. And sweet tea.  Next time I want to try the jambalaya and peach cobbler."}
{"text":"Visited this place with co-workers and ended up going three times in a week.  It's uber-yum, comfort food type of fare.  I'm not knowledgeable about Cajun food, but one person I know from Louisiana who has been to this place said it's, \"Really, really good.  You have to try her Mufasala!\"  And yes, I'm translating that last word.  All I recall is that is sounded like the name of Simba's father.    I have had the chicken and sausage gumbo, the shrimp etoffee (sp?), and the crab landry.  All were worth the visit.  Nice crew serving.  Fast and conversational.  It's cafeteria style after you order and have your food, though.  Self-serve drinks and table busing.  Pretty sure that if you visit, this place will be one of your regular spots, too."}
{"text":"I love southern cooking, service was nice and friendly. We ordered onion ring appetizer for 5.54 this was the half order, there were 6 onion rings that is almost a buck apiece, ouch. Dipping sauce was good.  Next we ordered jambalaya and red beans and rice, both were cold. My wife liked the blackened catfish but the cold beans and rice really turned us off.  Will try again in a few months maybe they will figure it out.  Value is important, I can get better at home for a quarter of the cost. Ambiance was mediocre you are greeted by a horrible noise when you open the door next to your ear, Cajun music was a little obnoxious but would be ok if food and value was better.  it should be fun to eat out, I was only looking forward to leaving."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the catfish and the jambalaya. The fried green tomatoes were tasty and the service was good. This place is a taste of New Orleans."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, I had the chicken and sausage gumbo and the Joliet rouge. Also Monday's kids eat free."}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place - I stopped by with my 12 year old for a quick dinner and it was a great choice - the atmosphere was really casual and welcoming. Our waitress was very happy to give suggestions and point out the can't miss items. We had the drunken cat fish and subbed our side for gumbo - everything tasted just as it should. We will definitely be stopping back by soon."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Good time! Great food! Fried green tomatoes amazing!  Jambalaya is a must try!  I can only give 5 stars but worth 10"}
{"text":"Food was good and service was outstanding. Very friendly staff. Felt like I was sitting in New Orleans. Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"We finally got a chance to eat at Flavors of Louisiana.  We both decided to get the Shrimp PoBoy.  I was really impressed with the flavor.  The shrimp were cooked to perfection.  I would have liked to try other items on the menu but that will have to be another time.  The decor is pretty basic but the food speaks for it self.  If you are looking for some great creole food I recommend hitting up Flavors of Louisiana."}
{"text":"This is my spot!   If you're looking for one place that has good food, great prices, adventurous eating, and great staff, this is it.   What can I say? The fried pickles, the muffuletta, the po'boy, the new cajun trio, the beignets, they are all pretty much outstanding.   I love the way this place looks on the inside. It has this faux wood, gator lovers feel to it, and it makes me smile every single time I'm there. The staff is friendly, knowledgable about the food, and always willing to stop and talk.   Follow them on Facebook for specials because the chicken stew is worth it's weight in gold! They also do crawdad specials and lots of great stuff for the kids!   My daughter loves the teas in the mason jars, you get a comfortable, well fed vibe with this place.   I had one problem, one time, and they gave me a free lunch to make up for it (I never cashed it in, the food is worth it, and mistakes happen from time to time).   Crawdad Pie? GET SOME! You've never had red beans & rice as good as this place either!   THIS IS THE PLACE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR!"}
{"text":"Awesome respectful, casual and family atmosphere with great customer service and delicious food. They have encouraging scripture posted daily near the register and are only closed on Sunday in honor of our Lord. Respectful and decent clothing for patrons is advised, thus promoting a comfortable and tasteful environment."}
{"text":"Best southern food I've had while living in Az. Red beans & rice is my fav Louisiana dish & theirs is phenomenal! Better than most the joints I tried while we lived in the panhandle of Florida!"}
{"text":"Being a Texas gal with a truly Southern food palette, Flavors sends you reminiscing about walks up and down Bourbon Street! The food is undeniably tasty and true to its name. My favorites are the red beans and rice, fried pickles, and the catfish! And the peach cobbler and beignets are worth the extra calories! The customer service is outstanding and its makes me smile when they remember my face and that I want sweet tea! Love to promote small places who arent chains! Worth the drive from anywhere!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended to eat here if I liked Catfish.  I stopped in yesterday and had lunch.  Catfish was great!  Ask for the Louisiana hot sauce!  Iced tea very good.  Service excellent.  Great place to eat and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"bomb dot com. Shrimp Po' boy cravings"}
{"text":"sooo goooodd!  my second time here and i'm glad.  servers were very friendly and attentive.  i studied the menu all day to figure out what i was going to order.  i picked the gumbo, dirty rice and fried oysters.  oh so good.  the oysters were my fav.  big and juicy.  the sweet tea was good too."}
{"text":"Excellent food! We tried the catfish, shrimp, onion rings, Fried pickles, Boudin balls, the potato chips and the fries... Everything was absolutely fantastic! Customer service was great and super attentive. Sweet tea was the best we've had in the valley. I hope this place stays open! Will go back to try all of their desserts. Very excited excellent dinner."}
{"text":"Yum. A nice change from the standard restaurants in the area. I don't like seafood and they have plenty of choices that are not \"fishy\". Good portions, large dining room, quick service."}
{"text":"The catfish was delicious as was the fried green tomatoes.  A must go for Cajun food."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here is good. The crawfish pie is filling. The only complaint I might have is that the food doesn't pop with flavor like I'm used to with Cajun food. But hey it's the middle of the desert and this is the best thing I have going for Cajun food like I remember from back home in the South"}
{"text":"Legit food spot. Awkward restaurant setup but the gumbo and jambalaya are totally legit. And the desserts. No beer or alcohol though :("}
{"text":"Have been coming here since they opened. I have never had a bad meal here. The food and service is great! Wish they had coupons every so often because it's spendy and I'd like to save a little! Best red beans and rice I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Listen...you can tell yourself a lot of lies in this life.   \"I don't like to eat pork\"  \"Fried food is yucky\"  \"I like unsweet tea\"  \"I'd never eat alligator\"  Lies, lies, lies!  Pork is delicious- adding it to any dish makes it ten times tastier. That's why Flavors' dirty rice, red beans and rice, the gumbo and the jambalaya all have some sort of tasty pork in them!   Fried food is best enjoyed when someone else is frying it, and the onion rings will serve you right, son. A crawfish pie (sadly, only seems to be available as part of the Cajun Trio) will make you ponder what you're even doing with your life and why aren't you eating more of these scrumptious crawfish-laden flaky-ass things? You can add an extra pie to the Trio when you order, and I suggest you do. Because damn.  You can't really be sitting there, drinking an unsweet tea with your Louisiana meal, can you? Get a sweet tea, fool! Stop tryna be healthy! This ain't the spot for that.   How can a reptile whose evolution peaked in the time of the dinosaurs become so crispy good when battered and doused in hot oil? Dip it in some remoulade and don't question Jeebus, because he knows what he's doing.  Flavors has outstanding food and great service. The Joliet Rouge might be my favorite dinner ever. Blackened catfish, with crawfish and skrimps on top in a tomato creole style sauce over dirty rice with garlic bread- holy good lord.   WORTH THE DRIVE FROM ANY PART OF THE WORLD!!! I love Flavors."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have a great southern sweet tea. Highly reccomnend to my friends."}
{"text":"Very good! Didn't know what to expect since I am from the south and here in the desert. Pleasantly surprised! Excellent shrimp and the gumbo was so good."}
{"text":"\"Cajun chips\"  taste and look just like store bought potato chips refried and seasoning added.  Disappointed after reading all these reviews. 10 dollars plus for 3 fish strips and the horrible aforementioned chips.. would have been better off at Long John Silvers"}
{"text":"So when my boyfriend and I came, the place was a ghost town. No cars outside and when we were seated, we were literally the only people in the joint. To me, this is usually a bad sign....but I couldn't be more wrong!! Since there really were no other customers we were taken care of very well. But man the food, that's what topped it. It was delicious, I had fried alligator and catfish. It was juicy and good. I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Went together as a whole family & enjoyed the catering. The jambalaya, chicken, crawfish, was all amazing! Fantastic banana pudding also!"}
{"text":"If you like Cajun/creole food you'll love this place.  It has the best jambalaya I have ever had (sorry NoLa).  The service can be slow on weekends... but the food makes it worth the wait."}
{"text":"Wow haven't had such a pleasant dining experience in quite sometime.  First off to be fair to other so called Cajun places in the valley while you are quite good, nothing compare to true Louisiana Cajun and boy that's what this is.    To start this is literally a mom and daughter joint!  They opened last year and are starting to get quite the following.  The location is a bit tricky but take the ten to dysart road make a right at Rancho Santa Fe and go into the parking lot of LA fitness and Walmart.  The restaurant is located right in front of the LA fitness.  We made the mistake of going to the other side of the road as most people do.    Inside the decor is quite simple chairs tables, condiment table with forks hot sauce and napkins the typical.  One side of the wall is dedicated to Louisiana State football so if your a Louisiana state football fan you are in good company.    The food is very good priced.  I started with the gumbo which had all types of seafood as well as rice and an absolutely fabulous broth.  It has to be the best gumbo in town.  They don't put okra in it which kind of takes away the traditional gumbo taste but the cook told me that they do that because a lot of people don't like the okra around here.   I loved it all the same.  Today was the special gumbo and it had fresh oysters in it.  Melt in your mouth Gumbo!  For my main dish I had the catfish, craw-fish and the red beans and rice.  The catfish and craw-fish were both spicy seasoned not spicy hot.  Which helps with not to take away the flavor of the meat.  I was stunned at how both of these fish had no fishy taste to them at all.  It was as if they were caught on the bayou and served to me minutes after the big catch.   The catfish was specially good.  It had a homade cornmeal crust fried to perfection and not goopy take away the flavor fried but perfectly lightly fried.   The craw fish were fried in an absolutely melt in your mouth buttery salty spicy batter again not to over bearing.  The fried stuff comes with some special tarter that is oh so tasty.  The red beans and rice will make you wanting more.  The texture is right on and the flavor is that southern spicy mouth watering rich red beans and rice like mom used to make.  They are addicting.  My girl got the catfish and dirty rice.  Again if you love dirty rice and I mean in a traditional way this is right on the money.    Overall I think I found a new eat out place.  It is well worth the money and the staff , flavor, and tradition of eating in a place like this makes me wonder how I can bring my self to eat at a chain.  If you want a good home cooked meal with southern hospitality this place is for you."}
{"text":"Tried this place a few weeks ago. Was digging the ambiance, nice look in the inside to get you in that southern state of mind, sweet tea was nice. Once we got out food everything nice stopped. I don't know if you ever had good gumbo before but mine sure wasn't. Hate to be negative but they need to revamp these recipes. Jambalaya was ok, not that great either. All in all if you're craving some Flavor of Louisiana this probably isn't the place for that but who knows, maybe I'm wrong..."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a couple of years - WOW!! - even better now than I remember!!  The restaurant is now twice the size it was then and pretty crowded last night.  Fried green tomatoes, chicken and sausage gumbo, shrimp creole and beignets for dessert.  Excellent service - excellent food - a great place!!  An hour and ten minutes from Scottsdale (Friday night rush hour) - worth every minute."}
{"text":"Phenomenal dining experience !!! I have only been here 3 or 4 times but each time I dine here I wonder why we don't come here more often. Clearly my husband has been taking our son here more often than I was aware of because our son was an expert on each menu item! The fried green tomatoes and boudin balls were excellent and served with 3 sauces; the roumalade one being the tastiest. I had the catfish po boy with Cajun chips ( skip those, just a boring chip) and red beans and rice. There are pieces of andouille sausage in the red beans and rice making it extra flavorful.  We had iced tea in a mason jar and beignet balls for desert. Truly like being in New Orleans"}
{"text":"Meh. It's pretty average for Cajun.   The Pros:  Super friendly service   Praline Cheesecake was to die for   The cons:  Not spicy at all  Not nearly as rich as it could be. Kinda tasted like their ettoufe was made to be healthy. If you're eating Cajun, you're not going for healthy. This is chest day food!  Hush puppies were very bland  Gumbo was super watery and didn't have a great flavor profile at all.    Bottom line is I struggle to get great Cajun in the town. The best so far is Baby Kays out in Mesa. Worth the drive. I had high hopes for this place based on their photos but it was a bust."}
{"text":"If I could do 2 1/2 stars I would-because the people were very friendly and the salad was amazing. But for the money, that's about it.   I went about 3:30pm, and I know that's an \"in-between\" time, but there was only 1 other table seated, they had eaten already (if they did) and was still there when I left.  I saw the sign, and since I enjoy Pappadeaux, but it's so far- I was game.  You walk up and order, I was looking for creole or cajun food, then asked re: Shrimp Ettoufee-which is a tricky dish I guess, but a good test run.  He said oh yes! So I ordered it. It came with a super delicious salad and rice. I just had water, and it was very good and cold and served in a canning jar-nice portion. Ok...so far so good.   The salad was soooo good-it was very fresh, diverse and delicious! I had the Creole ranch dressing-which I liked a lot. PLUS!  Then after a bit of a wait the Ettoufee arrived. It looked a bit different, but there was a lot of the brown gravy (it was clear though-kinda weird). The shrimp were pretty small, maybe a \"small-medium\" size, which were really one bite each. There were enough not to feel cheated, not enough to feel you could have a shrimp with every bite (I cut them in half to try).  The shrimp were not overcooked-a plus. But the gravy? It was...BLAND! If there was ANY spice in it at all...well, there couldn't have been! I did not order it bland, nor did he ask. I have had it several times in different states, and I have had worse and I have had much better too.   It was like eating...shrimp in brown gravy. Period. Cajun? NO WAY.  Hmmm..  The bread was pretty good though. The rice was nicely done.  BUT THE ETTOUFFEE!  UGH.  At  $16.00 (+ tip in jar) for lunch, I can not justify this.  Maybe that's why it's basically vacant when it opened back in December-I looked. Too bad-we NEED some cuisine cultural diversity in this city! This AIN'T it..."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good.   The service was great and the manager came around to check on everyone.  Old fashioned type of service.   Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I've been on a craving spree of catfish lately. This place didn't disappoint. Very good catfish!  Cool little place with a small town type feel."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time 6/21/13.  Lexie was our server and really made the experience great.  The sweet tea was really sweet and great.  Our glasses / jars were never empty the whole time we were there.  We had onion rings as an appetizer and they were crispy and the wife kept eating all the little crunchies.  Lexie brought us out samples of étouffée and gumbo to try as well as horseradish mustard to go with the onion rings.The daughter really liked the étouffée.  We ended up with 2 po boys, chicken strips and crispy shrimp.  The po boys were really good, even the son who doesn't like lettuce / tomatoes said the sauce made it, he had the shrimp. I had the tilapia and it was good as well.  The rolls were good but maybe just a little big for a po boy.  The 6 inch filled me up and the son brought the other half of his \"stomach bigger than brain\" 12 inch home.  The wife got the chicken and she liked it but it seemed kinda bland to me.  The daughter liked her shrimp but dipped her first into what she thought was a ketchup container but was like spicy cocktail sauce.  I also had red beans and rice as a side and those were great, I would go back just for those, over dirty rice as Lexie suggested. The place is a little set away from the street, so slightly difficult to find the first time.  There was lots of take out going on the whole time we were there so that tells you it's good.  Not a whole lot of ambience and for some reason the table seemed slightly high.  We were seated closer to the kitchen and I could hear a beeping from my seat the whole time we were there, although the rest of the fam couldn't.  It helps if you like seafood, the wife thinks maybe a salad option would be good as well.  Never having been to Louisiana I can't say how authentic but overall tasted good to all of us!  I read on here afterwards that they can do gluten free for most anything, but didn't see that on the menu, should be a more prominent option there. The service was really a highlight so ask for Lexie when you go, she's  a great steward for the place and knows her stuff.   All her recommendations were right on and I would trust her from now on. I would give 4.5 stars if I could.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Ok, 2nd Review and this place nailed it 2 times in a row with consistency, hospitality, cleanliness... but most important the food was GREAT..   This round, I got the Trio,,, Gumbo, Jambalaya, and the PIE.. omg..   Gumbo, I had last time, and this had the same great flavors.. On this round, I noticed what made this better than some others I have tried.. This Roux, isn't watered down and thin, its a good  thickness packed with flavor... The Jambalaya, to me is like a \"Combo Fried Rice\" but American based.. lol.   Crawfish PIE.. ok, Had a nibble on this when wife had it, and the breading was awesome.. like a cronut :o, but missed out on the actual stuffing.. This time it was all me, and I got the full monty on this.. The Crawfish inside had some nice chunk sizes, and you could definitely taste the crawfish, not overpowered by the other fixins.. dayum, was thinking this would be a great breakfast snack as well..   This is in our new rotation of dining.. until further notice :p"}
{"text":"Yum!  Best fried catfish I have ever had.  The staff is super friendly the food is great.  The desert menu changes daily but if you have the chance to try the bread pudding, go for it!  The shrimp etouffe is a great buttery, garlic wonderland in your mouth."}
{"text":"So done with this place! First the dry jambalaya and now this! $17 for five crawfish. Ridiculous. Never again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place! The atmosphere is great! The service is always amazing! The food is very authentic makes me feel like I'm back in NOLA! Everything on the menu is amazing! My favorite is the alligator and fried green tomatoes for the appetizers! The blackens catfish is my favorite main dish and the iced tea is amazing! I can't say enough good things about this place! This is out go to restaurant!"}
{"text":"We ate here this afternoon ...last time we were here was over a year ago!  It was SO good..again.  My husband and I both had the Shrimp Po'Boys and I love the way the shrimp sort of \"pops\" when you bite into it.  I love the bread as well, it is soft but chewy and holds up well to all the fillings.   My father had the Cajun Trio which was Seafood Gumbo, Jambalaya and Crawfish Pie.  He loved everything but especially liked the Gumbo.  We all took bites of the Crawfish Pie and it was delicious....full of cheesy, crawdaddy goodness with a buttery, slightly sweet crust.  The JBLA was also very good and had nice smoky flavor.  We shared a platter of Fried Pickles, Fried Green Tomatos and Onion Rings...so good.    I am giving them 5 stars because for the 3rd time...we talked about how good everything was all the way home.  My only minor complaint last time was the saltiness and nothing seemed overly salty this time.   I was sorry to see that someone who had been a good customer had one bad meal and felt they had to write about that experience and refer folks somewhere else.  We think it's great and will be back. Almost forgot:  we also had the Beignets and Sweet Tea.  The tea so WONDERFULLY sweet and you can taste the TEA!  The Beignets were warm and just terrific."}
{"text":"Bummed. I was looking forward to this place.. the jambalaya was very dry.  Forgot my side.  But really biggest thing is, it's over priced on a lot of the items."}
{"text":"Good food and service. I'm from Louisiana and it's hard to find good Louisiana style food. I would say this place is more cajun than creole. Gumbo has rich brown rue rather than a lighter creole style gumbo. Both are good but you should not expect New Orleans style food here but more of a West Louisiana cajun food is what you will get."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's worth the price.  The service is great, the gal that takes the orders is always kind and helpful.  The food is delicious!  I love the shrimp po boy with jambalaya for the side.   Yum!!!"}
{"text":"The food was a 4-4.5/5. The service was a 0. The food was great, the cat fish was a little salty, but overall it was great. The service on the other hand, was terrible. They brought my food with no silverware. I waited and waited, and finally had to ask where is my silverware after they told me they'd be right back with it after delivering my food (strike one). The dining area only had 4 parties, so being busy wasn't an excuse. Not once did they ask me to refill my empty drink, so I finally had to ask (strike two). When I placed my initial order, I ordered my dessert \"to go\", which of course they forgot about (no problem). Finally, as I sat back and watched, the other 3 parties were properly tended to, drink refills, asked how things were going. Not once did anyone ask me \"how was I doing?\" Or did I need a refill. Everything / every time, required me to flag someone down to ask (strike three). In short, if you are going to eat here I highly recommend you get it \"to go\"."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Catfish, boudin balls, shrimp étouffée, all scrumptious. Have never eaten Cajun before, I am amazed... Will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has been a long time coming.  It is damn near impossible for me to make it out to Avondale, ever, but we finally did last weekend and the first thing that sprang to mind was going here.  So very glad we did.  I ordered the chicken & sausage jambalaya and a sweet tea.  Their tea was pretty good, the jambalaya was amazing.  The dirty rice was some of the best I've ever had and the combination of meats and spices was perfect.  Really well done.  I would absolutely go back here if I ever made it out to Avondale again.  The only reason I marked them off is because of the location - far west valley, by a walmart, in a strip mall.  Too bad, downtown needs some decent southern cooking."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by locals, so I was excited to give it a shot.  Shrimp po' boy, potato salad, sweet tea, fried pickles with a homemade remoulade were a nice touch.    - Potato salad was very dill pickle-y.  For whatever reason that was not a good surprise, when I usually love most types of pickles.  It did look ultra delicious though. - Shrimp po' boy... this wasn't bad necessarily, it just wasn't great; I would definitely not order this again. - Fried pickles were beautifully fried and the remoulade had a really nice kick of horse radish that balanced the saltiness perfectly.    Also you can get a gallon of freshly brewed sweet tea for $5, which is a good deal.  I would most likely not return."}
{"text":"Excellent Cajun food! We were very excited to try this place out since my hubby is from Louisiana and we love Cajun food. We ordered so much food since and it was all so delicious. We got some hushpuppies and a cup of seafood gumbo to start and thought they were both cooked perfectly. I wished I ordered a large bowl of that gumbo.....it was that good! Then we had the red beans and rice and a catfish dish and we were both very pleased. Their sweet tea is refreshing too! We will definitely return for  great meal."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch on a Saturday with two buddies who had previously been here and raved about it. It was pretty dead for noon on a weekend but that just means better service. Upon walking in we were greeted with a few smiling faces. Picked a table and looked over the menu; I was surprised they did not have any lunch specials. Either way after mulling over the options I chose the crawfish etouffee. Buddies got gator po-boy and shrimp etouffee. Food came out rather quickly - maybe within 10 minutes. The presentation was worthy of any dish that adorns the cover of cooking magazines. I loaded up with some Louisiana gold pepper sauce and went to town. The garlic bread that accompanied the dish was awesome. If you have ever had Cajun cooking you know what I'm talking about; that fluffy bread with a nice flaky outer layer. The dish had a rather substantial amount of crawfish; the roux was nice and thick, the rice was cooked well, the spice level was on point. After devouring it in what seemed like two bites we decided to go for some beignets and banana pudding. Beignets were warm and doughy and not too much powered sugar and the pudding I didn't try so I can't comment on it. Service was excellent and I'm excited for my next visit."}
{"text":"Very good chow and service was ok They lose a stars for using packets of honey and the annoying bell set up they have on their entry door. I'll be back to try again."}
{"text":"Why five stars? I debated but even though this is a very casual restaurant and table service is available only on weekends, this is a place you have to try if you like cajun & creole cooking. I lived in the southern Louisiana Bayou country, and this is the real deal! We come often. They can cook many dishes gluten-free. The menu is mostly seafood and the catfish is hands-down the best around. All of the dishes are authentic home-style Louisiana fare."}
{"text":"This place is like a little gold gem, we have been here a few times now and every time we go the service is amazing and the food is beyond yummy. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone who wants great Louisiana cooking. Definitely well worth returning and the price we paid."}
{"text":"I'm totally in a wonderful state of shock.  Not even a week after writing my review, the owner of the restaurant sent me a private message apologizing for the experience I had and offered to comp my next meal.  What a wonderful, attentive business owner.  The fact that I only have 4 reviews and am a relatively new Yelper didn't matter a bit.  Mad props to Flavors, I am completely impressed."}
{"text":"Had a oyster po boy. Oysters were GREAT.  Fresh and cooked to perfection. I think the roll it was served on was not near as good as Subway and took away from the meal, ALOT."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last night and spent a lot of $ and the food was awful. The food is frozen, canned or box, nothing was fresh. Our family is from Louisiana, this is very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Pretty amazing place!  Service was great, server very friendly and Rick the manager/owner was extremely personable.   Now the food!  Had shrimp po'boy, jambalaya @ onion rings.  Excellent!  Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"First time to this establishment after seeing the Yelp reviews. First , before entering the restaurant, there are old tables stacked on the sidewalk and some kind of large stain on the sidewalk as well. Pretty strange, looks like it could have been a crime scene. The windows are filthy with so many fingerprints the FBI would have a field day. Upon entering it's pretty wide open and somewhat dirty looking. Strange smell as well.   Ordered the fried pickles as an appetizer and they were just ok. We both ordered the shrimp Poorboy and a chicken/ sausage gumbo just to try it.  The gumbo rue was green, not the rich brown color you see in New Orleans.  It just wasn't very good!! The poorboy were also just ok. The breading on the shrimp was soggy and just fell off. It's pretty obvious nobody here has ever experienced real New Orleans cajun food. This isn't even close. Definitely will not go back here."}
{"text":"In a strip mall facing the street is the sister to the restaurant that is on the west side in Avondale.  Simple interior great food.  We tried the trinity ,  jambalaya, crawfish pie as in handheld, and the gumbo.  The jambalaya was nicely spiced, the crawfish pie had a sturdy crust and wa ok, the gumbo was great."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want authentic CAJAN cooking.  The food is well prepared and is not overly spiced unless you ask for it.  The Jambalaya is only available a few days a week and is great.   The use of real ingredients make this place a MUST VISIT if you like Cajun and do not want to pay outrageous prices fore scenery.    I visit this place at least twice a month. The GUMBO is great but more soupy than I am use to getting in Mississippi.  The taste is great and the ingredients are quality.  For a treat order a ALLIGATOR PO-Boy sandwich and have a real treat like nothing you can get anywhere north of the GULF of Mexico."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and authentic (and I was born and raised in New Orleans). We had the shrimp poboy and the bread is from New Orleans. The gumbo and onion rings were  great. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Ok so lets start off with that I was really excited to try this place. I have been on this cajun food kick since my unexpected cancellation of my New Orleans trip and having a big Mari gra pot luck at work. I read the reviews and saw nothing but good things about this place. Javier and I went here on a Friday about 2 weeks ago. We both ordered the same thing. ( I usually like to order different things so we can taste each others food). We had a shrimp po boy with seafood gumbo and sweet tea. Lets start off with the good. The po boy was delicious, I liked it alot. The portion was huge, we ordered the half one and it was still a very good size so I could imagine the full size one. The bread was toasty but not too hard and the sauce in the po boy had a really good flavor. I topped it off with some Louisianna hot sauce which made it just that much more better. Second, the sweet tea was delicious. I love that it was brewed tea not the typical fountain nestea kind filled with artifical flavor. Since Javier and I both dont drink sodas finding a good beverage alternative is always a plus. Ok and now for the bad, and I really hate to do this because I really wanted to like this place alot. Im picky in the kind of seafood I eat, so I asked the cashier what kind of seafood in the gumbo. Given that I was in there on a Friday during Lent this was the only kind available. They had told me only shrimp and crab, perfect since those are two kinds of seafood I actually like. So when we get our order the gumbo smells really fishy, not typical of shell fish. I look through it and it looks as there is crawfish in there as well. I know for sure I do not like crawfish and if they would have told me that was included in the gumbo I for sure would have ordered another side. This isnt even the worse part. In Javier's gumbo there was something green and slimey looking. We had no idea what it was, looked like it could have been octopus tentacles or fish guts. Really it was that wierd looking. I now wish I would have taken a picture of it just to find out what the heck it was. Now I can admit I am a hard person to please with food, Javier on the other hand will eat almost about anything. Now for something to make this man not finish his food has to be really bad. Also the place was kind of pricy, our total bill was $14.00 and that included a buy one get one free meal coupon from the Entertainment book and 2 drinks. Needless to say we will not be returning. Yes I loved the sweet tea and the po boy, this was not enough to return back or to spend our $$$ there."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, I saw this restaurant on\"Check Please, Arizona\" and it lives up to it's standards. This is authentic Louisiana food and it taste so good it'll make you slap yo mamma! (figuratively) We all had the Shrimp etouffee  and it taste delish! Also, Had the red beans for a side and they were amazing! Yum, the service was great and so was the ambiance. Overall it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"There alligator po boy sandwich was delicious along with the seafood gumbo. Awesome. Gf got the chicken po boy/w fries. Also grab beignets which I was kind of disappointed in cause they don't taste like the beignets I had before."}
{"text":"I really don't know how I lived in this neighborhood for this long...and didn't realize Flavors of Louisiana was here.  OK, that's not entirely true. This place is tucked in a little strip mall next to the LA Fitness place next to Walmart. If you aren't looking for it, you won't find it.  But you need to find this place. Quickly. This place serves incredibly tasty Cajun food. My wife used to live in SE Texas and says it's as authentic as you'll get.  As other reviewers have already noted, this place won't overwhelm you with ambiance. Which is just fine, because you're here for the food. We had catfish, alligator tails, shrimp, dirty rice, and red beans and rice. It was all fresh, cooked to perfection, and was enhanced by the real Louisiana Hot Sauce. If you like tartar sauce and get fish, make sure you get some of their Cajun tartar sauce. Good stuff, Maynard.  Tip: we got there about 11:30am, and had no trouble finding a seat. But this place gets crazy busy for lunch. Come at noon, and you might want to get it to go.  Tip #2: this isn't a budget place to get food. Po' Boys run about $10, and my plate was $14. But it's worth it. Save up and splurge on great food."}
{"text":"As always, AMAZING!  We love this place so much!  The Cajun fries are so good, and they never disappoint.  My husband had the alligator po' boy and loved it!  Everyone should give this place a shot, this is one of our favorite places!"}
{"text":"Good little place to take the family. Kids eat free on Mondays. I always like the red beans and rice with sausage and my husband thinks the catfish is the bees knees. When we go we will usually get an order of hush puppies too. Soo good. The service is good and so are the prices."}
{"text":"I love this place everything is literally made from scratch it may be a little pricey but its worth every penny, the po boys are good & the gumbo is excellent."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place and decided to give it a try. Service was terrific and super friendly. Placed an order to go. Red beans & rice & sausage were tasty but not too spicy. I must say that the fried shrimp was the best I have ever had: large, lightly breaded, juicy, and perfectly cooked. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I am glad I found this place while searching on YELP! The food here is outstanding! I had the Crawfish Pie and hubby had the Blackened Alligator Po-Boy. The crawfish pie was to die for!! It was wrapped in the most flakey crust ever. So buttery it melted in your mouth! Sinful! The blackened alligator was seasoned to perfect and the bread was amazing! I was so glad to hear that they will be opening one up in Surprise. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants on the west side. Truly a hidden gem. Delicious Creole! Fried green tomatoes were my favorite. Oyster po boy was on point! Cant remember the gentleman's name but our server was great as well! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Was excellent. Catfish topped with crawfish etuffe was  delicious. Staff are very helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"The reason for the 2 stars is mainly from the horrific service.  We visited for lunch.  We were greeted and sat very quickly and the lady who sat us seemed on top of things.  That changed with our actual server.  It was a young guy....looked to be in his late teens.  He was probably the slowest server I've ever had.  He seemed to not know anything or care much either.  Two people in our party ordered drinks aside from just water.  Nothing difficult, just a soda and a tea.  They didn't receive these drinks until well after we received our food....and after asking about them.  When we asked about the status of the food, he had no idea.  We had ordered Cajun cheese fries for the group as an appetizer, and he didn't know how much longer those would take.  His response was \"I'm not sure.  Maybe 10 or 15 more minutes.\"  For fries?  REALLY?  We had already been waiting about 20 minutes for our food at that point.  We received our meals, but still no cheese fries.  We ended up asking him to cancel the fries, because we all had to get back to work.  Instead of bringing the check out, he brings out the plate of fries that are now done, when we had already established that we wanted to cancel that and get our check.  He took them back to the kitchen, but we still didn't receive our check.  After asking for our check another time, we finally received it. There was really no reason anything should have taken that long.  The restaurant wasn't very full.  We weren't the only table that was waiting long for their food.  It seemed like all the tables were.    The food wasn't bad.  I ordered the shrimp landry.  I wouldn't order that again.  The fried shrimp that come with it were the only good thing.  The rest of the table seemed to like their food though.  Our server ended up packing the fries for us to take.  We had them once we got back to work.....those were better than the shrimp landry by far.     Definitely bad service."}
{"text":"Got food at this location for the first time today . Let me tell you it was delicious. I had the catfish basket combo . Customer service was also great .. I will be returning soon ."}
{"text":"The food served at this location is the worse around. The Angry Crab has this establishment beat by far. The Taste of Louisiana is too pricey and the quality of the food does not reflect New Orleans or Gulf Coast foods. The owner is from Baton Rouge Louisiana the taste will be a little different. The beans always taste brunt over cooked.The food is so terrible and people who does not know will think that it taste great. The food served in this establishment does not reflect southern or New Orleans foods."}
{"text":"This place is definitely out of my way since I went to Arizona for business purposes. But when I heard about this place and what they have to offer I definitely wanted to give it a try. I wish I didn't because now when I want it, I know it will be too far for me to go.  The first thing that caught my eye was the atmosphere which does give a Louisiana vibe (never been there). The next thing I noticed is the deep fried alligator, which I ordered with a side of rice and beans and sweet tea. I also ordered appetizers for my wife and I which included hush puppies, fried pickles, and fried green tomatoes.   The fried pickles were one of the best fried pickles my wife had had. The fried green tomatoes were very juicy and taste exactly what it is, which you know what I mean if you had fried green tomatoes. The hush puppies were decent and had more of a savory corn bread flavor.   The alligator itself was the best alligator I had (only had alligator two other occasions). It was perfectly fried and it tasted like alligator (not chicken!). I was also surprised with the rice and beans. This place actually put some effort into preparing they sides. They also offered free refills on the sweet tea which I couldn't get enough of.  If I could, I would go to this place at least once a week. Unfortunately for me it is a five hour drive from where I live. If I am ever in the area again, I will definitely stop by at this place again."}
{"text":"I love this place. While many of their Cajun dishes are good, make sure to try a bowl of the banana pudding. One of the best desserts I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Great service! My friends and I decided to stop in after shopping at a near by mall. I'm so glad we did. The general manager came by and checked on us which was a nice touch. I plan to return to this location!"}
{"text":"Just ate there for the first time. Everything was outstanding. Had the fried pickles for the appetizer. The wife had the muffuletta with potato salad and I the catfish. Some of the best catfish I have ever had. Wasn't over cooked like I've gotten at most places. All the food was outstanding. Friendly staff. The service was very quick but this was at lunch on a Saturday. The waitress said we wouldn't get our food that quick on a Friday night because they are really busy."}
{"text":"Husband & I decided to try this out after going to the \"Flavors of the West\" Goodyear event. The seafood gumbo was watery but the flavor was okay, the jambalaya was a sticky dry mess on your plate and it came with a side salad that you can tell it was a grocery store bagged salad not fresh at all! At the end we were hoping for at least something to take the bad taste in your mouth and we ordered dessert, big mistake! The \"Banana pudding\" was boxed pudding.... the beignets were dense and had more powder sugar on them that if you exhaled while you took a bite it would go flying everywhere. I wouldn't recommend this food and you really don't even want to get me started on the ambiance... Seriously! Try it at your own risk!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife is Cajun, so we're always on the hunt for places like this. The blackened catfish poboy is a must. The crawfish pies are wonderful as well. The beignets go without saying... do it! So good. The peach cobbler has a crust that is dangerous good. Try the fried green tomatoes with the mustard sauce too. Mix all of that up with a great staff that goes above and beyond to satisfy, and you really are missing out if you don't  give this place a try. Also, like them on Facebook to find out when they are doing crawfish boils! So much better than any other crawfish we've had around here!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing the po boy was the best I have ever had!!! I recommend trying this place out well worth the money"}
{"text":"Our first visit and my girlfriend was surprised at how pleasant the atmosphere was for being in a strip mall.  The decoration and music added to the overall experience.  The waitress, Carlee, provided outstanding customer service.  Her service level was that of a five star restaurant.  She took time to explain the history of the locally owned restaurant that continues to expand.  Immediately we felt welcome and that set the stage for a positive dining experience.  The food was good.  The fried green tomatoes were outstanding, the oyster po boy was good.  Would be nice to have option of ordering fried oysters in basket.  We do intend to visit again."}
{"text":"Man, I can't even speak enough about this place. My husband and I came across this place about 2 1/2 years ago when we first moved to Phoenix on accident. We LOVE it! Never leave without ordering their fried gator. I enjoy the seafood gumbo and my husband likes their chicken and sausage gumbo. Everything else we've had tastes great too. We take all of our guests that come from out of town to this place and it's never failed! Ordering to-go can sometimes take awhile."}
{"text":"If I could give ten stars I would. WOW! First time in, I went simple with 3 catfish strips and fries. I'm picky when it comes to catfish so I figured passing that test would be a good indicator whether I come back or not. Now I've been a big fan of Pappadeaux for years but will have to say hands down, Flavors of Louisiana far surpasses them in the catfish dept! The fries were overly delicious too, a fat spirally version of your normal cut. The bread that came with my basket was also the best restaurant bread I've tasted. Ever. Their tartar sauce wasn't really needed due to the savory spices on the fish but nonetheless I tried a few dips and was surprised how tasty it was too. I can't wait to go back and dive into their menu. When out-of-state family/friends come to visit, Flavors of Louisiana will be first on the list of restaurants to show off."}
{"text":"Yummy food, great menu and funky atmosphere.  Loved it all. They are not shy that they are a Christian oriented place if that offends then get your gumbo somewhere else!"}
{"text":"First time here. Food was superb. Had the PoBoy shrimp and the chicken w/sausage gumbo. PoBoy was great, the gumbo was loaded. Had peach cobbler for dessert. Yummy! AND I finished my daughter's catfish as it was more than she could eat. I would definitely eat here again. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"I saw this place on my way home from work and was excited about having some Cajun food in the area.  The reviews seemed promising so I stopped in around 6pm for dinner and was seated right away.  Sadly, I'd have to say that, overall, I was disappointed.  I ordered the Alligator Combination Plate with a side of Jambalaya and an additional side of Gumbo.  The alligator was very tender and juicy and the best part of the experience.  The 8 oz. side order of Jambalaya, listed as their \"Cajun Speciality\" was very dry and uninspiring.  I was actually relieved that I opted for the alligator as the main dish rather than the Jambalaya.  I love Jambalaya and this was toward the low end of the yum spectrum.  The extra 8 oz. side order of Gumbo wasn't that great either.  It was far too salty for my liking.  So much so that I couldn't finish the Gumbo.  I'd have to say that the service was... meh.  I felt a bit rushed during my dining experience.  I wasn't offered a refill on my lemonade and I wasn't asked if I'd like any dessert.  I *did* want dessert, but the feeling of being rushed and presented the check changed my mind.  I opted to get some dessert on the way home.    I really hoped that this place would live up to the reviews, but it really fell short for me.  I gave it 2 Stars, which means that I will, more than likely, not return."}
{"text":"The Gumbo is to die for.  I have tried the sandwiches as well.  The Gumbo is my absolute favorite.   The staff is always friendly and even when the place is packed you still get great customer service"}
{"text":"I was out that way to see a movie that was only showing at Harkins Estralia , so stopped in Taste and ordered to go.  Restaurant was clean, big and relatively busy.  I got Shrimp Po' Boy and Chicken Sausage Gumbo.  Po' Boy bread was thick and tough.. not flaky, airey and crumbly... Disappointed again... I'd love the bread with ham!..... It's just not what po'boy bread is supposed to be.  The gumbo was watery and near tasteless.  This is not what you'll get off Decatur in the French Quarter."}
{"text":"Very slow and poor service. Took 51 minutes to receive my 6\" po boy alligator sandwich, they forgot my side until i was ready to leave, i asked for alligator meat on the side when i ordered, once again while i was waiting for my food, and a 3rd time when i finally got my side. Then they said, \"oh we are sorry, we didn't make extra to give you as a side\""}
{"text":"I found this place online after looking for gluten free food in my area.  I visited New Orleans for the first time last month.  I loved walking in here and hearing the Cajun music blaring.  For those who have Celiac, nearly everything on the menu can be made gluten free, and without an additional charge.  I had fried shrimp, fried pickles, and cajun chips.  It was heavenly - especially after not having fried food at all in nearly 4 years!  My husband had an alligator po boy and gumbo.  He enjoyed it immensely.  I had a bite of his gumbo and it tasted just like the one that I had in NOLA.  This place is more authentic than Baby Kay's, and the service was great too."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Called to get food, picked up food In 15 minutes. Service was fast and friendly. Food was hot and ready when I got there. We got two gator po boys. Fried pickles, tomatoes, and onion rings. Needless to say I'm in a food coma from stuffing my face. Would definitely recommend anyone give it a try."}
{"text":"If you think you like Cajun food, you definitely will after visiting here. I was in the area on business travel for a couple of days. Ended up stopping here twice during my few days in town. Try it!"}
{"text":"Best Louisiana food that I have had in Arizona. I had the Dunkin Catfish and beingets for dessert. My friend had the gumbo and shrimp creole. We were full and happy when we left."}
{"text":"All in all this was a very good lunch. This is probobly the best cajun food available in Glendale, AZ or the surrounding area.  Fried pickles were absolutely amazing and cooked perfectly  Shrimp Po Boy was done just right  Only gripe was the coleslaw which was too saucy for me, and a bit tart, it tasted like apple vinegar or something. Not so bad that I want to stay away...just something I wouldnt order again.  Very nice staff and quick turn-around"}

{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but couldn't.   A friend told me about it and she enjoyed her experience. We got there around 6pm yesterday, not busy at all and we were seated right away. That was a good start. However, it took almost 15 minutes for someone to come take our order. There weren't a lot of wait staff available. Tables stayed unbussed all around us the entire visit. When we finally received our food, much of it was bland and under seasoned. The hush puppoes were good, bit the fried green tomatoes had little to no flavor.  I ordered the blackened tilapia salad. I don't think what I received was tilapia it tasted like dirty catfish. I only had one bite and couldn't get that taste out of my mouth for several hours. My husband ordered the fried catfish and said it was okay but being from Louisiana he was unimpressed. His red beans and rice were under cooked...both had crunch to them which is not what you want from this dish.   Service was slow Food was underseasoned  Fish was inedible Bathrooms smell terrible  We will not be going back!!!"}
{"text":"First time visit and it did not disappoint. Walk up order and pick a table. Super friendly staff! I had to get a sampling, so I ordered a shrimp platter w/ red beans & rice and seafood gumbo with fried catfish. Portions were good size. Everything was delicious. Both the fried shrimp and catfish were terrific. Catfish taste was clean and not mushy, and it wasn't greasy at all. My friend, who is from Arkansas ordered the Dunkin Catfish. He savored every bite and said it was the best Cajun meal he's had in a very long time.   I do wish they offered beer and wine, it goes so well with Cajun food. But I learned that the owner will not allow if for personal reasons and I respect that.    See you again real soon."}
{"text":"Yum! We had the gator and chicken tenders. Loved it!!!  Didn't get a chance to try dessert but it looked amazing."}
{"text":"The food is Really good!!! One of my favorite restaurants. I took my mom and sister here as treat and they absolutely loved it.  The food is really good blackened and their sweet tea is straight from the south. I would recommend this places. The only down fall is it is pretty pricey."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday for takeout. It took close to 10 minutes before we were greeted or helped and the place wasn't busy. But it looked like only one waitress/cashier was working. I ordered the trio with gumbo, jambalaya, and a crawfish cake/pie.  My friend ordered catfish. He was pretty happy with his food. The jambalaya was pretty good. The gumbo was fair. I wasn't a fan of the crawfish pie/cake thing. If you're into a seafood pot pie/empanada type thing it's probably great, but I'm not. We also got beignets which were bomb! The mural inside was nice; it really looks like a bayou. I'll definitely go back to try something else but I'll order ahead."}
{"text":"Po Boy was awesome, i suggest catfish, craw fish, or gator.  price is good, they also knocked down the wall so it's bigger now. They are also now open on Mondays.   USEFUL?!?!"}
{"text":"First time have eaten there. The food started out ok until we cut a boudin ball and found a whole fly. The response from the server was let me take it back and take a picture of it????   They said sorry and they will give us a discount coupon for our return.... Really, we will not be back. I guess the kitchen is in the same disrepair as the front of the house."}
{"text":"OK, so you are probably wondering why is a NY gal writing a review on a Creole restaurant? I thought the same thing. I do not like Creole food per say ( Crawfish and Aliigator-??? seriously? Teehee. I still have nightmares  of those lil crawfish guys screaming when my friends had to cook them live at the catering resort I used to work at)  but I take chances on eating so when my friend said, \"Lets go here my hubbie likes it and we can bring him some take out\".  I said, \"sure\". (I always forget Cajun style cooking is not the same as Creole food-lol!) Add to the fact I am on a diet and really there wasn't much I could eat here since everything is deep fried and i do not like catfish. But this is what I observed while I was there. The southern customers in this place were raving about it. It is one of the few places they told me ( if not only) around town that has alligator if you like that. And now the reason for my review. Ok , wait for it-------The BREAD PUDDING! OMG! it is delish here! Some of the best I have ever had. Now they serve it with this white, sweet whiskey sauce. My friend and I have no pride and no shame so we were actually drinking the stuff right out of the little to go container. We were probably drunk all afternoon. LOL! Nay the alcohol cooks off so they say, but does it????HMMMMM!  But folks you heard it here first go and try it. So if you like Creole food you might like it. ( my friend says their portions are to small) But more importantly if you like dessert first, go for the bread pudding, like daily and if you like fancy whiskey sauce move in- I heard they have a cot in the kitchen-teehee!. Ok so there is my light-hearted review. Enjoy. I will go back and try a Poboy for sure. I had these rice style deep fried balls that were really gross! I definitely won't be ordering them again! (But they are suppose to be a southern comfort food-BLAH!!!!!!)"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place out. The word was this place was a good lottle hole in the wall. Naturally, this caught my attention. When I went to Baton Rouge I had the best damn catfish I ever ate. So I was hoping with expectations being so high that maybe there would be another rendition of it. I was grossly (pun intended) wrong.   The staff was immensly kind and welcoming. So you could see my perspective was maybe all the things I heard about this place are true. I asked what would be the best thing to eat here. I was told the Po Boy but anything really is great. I instead ordered my catfish with the hope that it was as good or just out right good. When I indulged, I was was so dissapointed. The quality was that of something I could have caught and grilled on my own. ( not a chef) So to wrap up my tale, buyer beware, not all hole in the walls possess hidden food treasures."}
{"text":"We had originally attempted to come here a few months ago, but our friends decided it looked \"too cheap, dirty, and gross.\"  Ugh... we swore that we would come back next time we were out in the neck of the woods and I am really glad we did!    The restaurant is located in an average looking strip mall and the interior is just as average.  That's fine by me though.  Like someone else said in their review, at least I can see where their priorities are.  I ordered the 2 meat combo with shrimp and crawfish tails.  It was served with my choice of side, and I went with the cole slaw.  I was surprised at how flavorful the cole slaw actually was.  The shrimp were big and their outsides were really crispy.  They were quite yummy.  There were tons of baby crawfish tails, battered and fried like the shrimp.  Those were also yummy and quite succulent.  I really really enjoyed my meal.  If you come here, don't make the mistake that I did and not notice the yummy seasoning on the table.  I didn't notice it until after I was full, but I sampled it, and it was DELICIOUS!  I will definitely come back here next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Our first visit was good, the food was great and the ambiance was cool and loosyanna stylish Loved the peach cobbler and vanilla ice cream... so good.. after 3 visits we quit going,  the food was super super salty and when i complained i was told by our waitress  \" yea, that's just the way its made\"  well we haven't been back since and its too bad because we loved it the first time and would have given it 4 stars, its also on the little too expensive side. We love supporting family businesses but not going out of our way to spend good money at a place that won't train their employees about correcting customer complaints to ensure repeat business and word of mouth referrals."}
{"text":"This is getting to be one of our favorites!  Been here three or four times.  Each time has better better than the last. Great food - outstanding service.  One jambalaya and one clam Landry an order of fried tomatoes and one order of beignets (with honey). Spectacular!!  A forty-five minute drive but certainly worth the drive."}
{"text":"At least the entertainment was good...   Even though it was completely unwelcome.   Tonight I had the severe displeasure of attempting to eat at Flavors of Louisiana.  When we first arrived, a nice gentleman welcomed us and seated us promptly.  Chatted with us on the way to the table, great employee.  Sadly, he would not be our waiter who was very much not a great employee, or even a decent human being as far as was displayed tonight.    After being seated and placing our order, we wouldn't see our waiter again for 45 minutes.  He stopped by to deliver a lie about how \"the oil got shut off next door so we couldn't cook anything.\"  I overheard another waiter actually being honest with customers explaining that they were short staffed.  This is reasonable.  This accounts for our food that hadn't shown up, but not for the empty beverage glasses and 45 mins between visits.    Once the food showed up I noticed my gumbo was cold (chicken and sausage) while my partners was piping hot and giving off steam.  Mine was also covered in a greasy layer and was basically inedible so no huge loss.  Red beans and rice were good if you are into johnsonville sausage and boil in bag rice I suppose, at least they were warm.  I start to eat my Po Boy and yep, also cold.  Interesting since the kitchen just got its \"oil\" back, huh?  More like they were sitting there for a while and our sever couldn't be bothered to do his job.  I managed to flag him down again all the way across the restaurant (because it's not like he bothered to check back) and told him those items were cold and asked how that could happen when I had waited that long.  He simply said he didn't know, I said to just remove them from the bill.  After all, we'd been there an hour and a half at that point.    This is where it reality gets good.  He starts to loudly complain to another server that I sent my cold food back (like I care, and this is exactly why I wouldn't accept a remade order).  He then proudly and triumphantly marches back to lecture me (lol)! He tells me \"since you were SO RUDE I went ahead and took those off the bill for you?\" Um no, sweetie... you took them off the bill because they were inedible and I sent them back.  I tried explaining to him that I didn't feel like that was rude at all, in fact I was frustrated that we had sat there so long with no service and were given cold food. That's just ridiculous. His attitude became far worse after we exchanged words, obviously frustrated with having another table leave and not getting anything off of mine and he flew right off the handle, obviously too unstable and insecure to be in a public facing role.  Then it gets even better! The waiter actually yells \"F*** YOU!\" at me, then \"you're lucky I don't kick your ass!\" I couldn't help but wonder if this was real life, how would any business owner or manager let their staff act like common gutter trash?  Like I'm going to react to this dramatic rendition, lol please. Surely management was nowhere in the building based on this and the rest of the poor service all night.    At least one other table got up and left due to not getting thier food as well, so it clearly wasn't isolated.  It was also the same servers table, which is unsurprising.    So if you're in the mood for cold food, being cursed at, and threatened with assault then by all means enjoy a meal here.  I suspect you aren't, though... so here's your warning: AVOID at all costs.  I reached out to the business owner to let him know what happened and his only response was a :cry: emoticon... so if you ever have issues here you can be assured you will not get resolution."}
{"text":"Being from Louisiana and have been cooking and eating Cajun food since I could walk. I can easily say this is not good. They should hire a new chef, or take a class from an actual Cajun who cooks pretty decent Cajun food. The food was dry, the flavors were okay but definitely not \"Cajun\". Half the food ordered was burnt.."}
{"text":"I visit family in the Phx area once a year and this place is a must! I haven't had this level of perfect cajun since the last time I was here...lol My favorites are the boudin balls, gumbo, catfish, drunken catfish, fried green tomatoes, fried pickles, hush puppies and PEACH COBBLER..that's all I've ordered so far..I must try something different next time. Ms Goff is the sweetest cajun lady  ever!  You won't be disappointed!"}
