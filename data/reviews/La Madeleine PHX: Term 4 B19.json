{"text":"Staff is very friendly here and just as fast as the McD next door. Prices are good being that it is at the airport. Freshly brewed ice tea was great.  Nice place"}
{"text":"Thank you for being open 24 hours!!!! Food was pretty fresh...friendly, great customer service! Tyra is so sweet! Thank you for your hospitality and going above and beyond!"}
{"text":"It's kind of funny to write a review for an airport concession spot but this one definitely deserves a shout out. I visited twice in 2 weeks and got the same consistent friendly service from Cole who greets everyone in French like he means it. The food was excellent, lots of simple and gourmet choices. He even gave me a choice of chips or banana with my sandwich and that was a nice surprise. I visited again and got the French onion soup and a cappuccino. I felt like I was in a cafe not the airport. This is a great place to stop if you're at Sky Harbor Airport."}
{"text":"I was happy to find something other than the usual airport fast food options, and La Madeleine has some excellent choices without a long wait. However, when I found a piece of some sort of meat in a quiche Lorraine, I took it back. The manager refused to admit that a piece of meat could have found its way into my quiche and kept repeating the recipe to me. I know the recipe, but there was clearly something meaty in there. He kept saying it must be a piece of tomato. Really? Not even beefsteak tomatoes look like that!! So they offered me anything else I wanted on the menu. Very nice. I ordered the Pasta Madeleine, hold the chicken. Obviously, I don't want meat in my meal. All I wanted was exactly what was listed on the menu, HOLD the chicken. But what I got was a plate of wild rice with the mushroom sauce on it and broccoli on the side. I don't get it.  Pasta Madeleine is ON THEIR MENU. It has pasta with mushroom sauce and broccoli and parmesan, etc. PASTA. Not rice. At that point, I gave up. I had a flight to catch. I just ate what they gave me. It was good. But never again."}
{"text":"How and I mean HOW does this place have any positive reviews? It is dirty (check out the drink machine) and the staff are less than enthused to help you. The food is edible, but not by much. I had the chicken Caesar and the chicken was weird and brown. Skip this place and get a protein bar instead."}
{"text":"When stuck in Phoenix due to an electrical storm or waiting for a connecting flight...La Madeleine is a godsend.  If you're running low on your caffeine high or in need of good coffee - this is the place to get it.  Along with great coffee, you can also enjoy French inspired pastries.  If coffee isn't what you're looking for, try one of their sandwiches or soups. Whatever you get you will not be disappointed.  You have limited options at an airport...why waste it on fast food or a bad coffee stand, do yourself a favor and give La Madeleine a chance."}
{"text":"I used to work for LM under a different franchise. I miss the pasta. I arrived ridiculously early before my flight and decided to make my way over here. Busy this evening. 

There is a good selection for quicker meals. Sandwiches and the dessert case available to grab before your flight. I decided to sit down and order the pesto pasta with extra sauce. I can't give four stars because it kinda bugged me that I didn't get a breadstick-what comes with all adult pastas-I got the half of a bread bun for sandwiches in place of a breadstick. So one off for that. Also the tables feel very flimsy to be honest. But what matters is the food. 

The pasta is delicious. Sauces were hot once handed out to me. Breadstick/bun was hot as well. So I can't discount them too much because the staff here is working it hard and it's an airport location of a chain brand. On busy days they probably run out fast. Even the manager is jumping in. A tall man in a red shirt, helping declutter and clean up tables. So everyone is swinging hot and doing a great job. Soda station is clean and stocked. It's an airport, so the bathroom review goes to sky harbor (it's clean). Hot coffee checked 3 times by staff while writing this (!). 


They are working hard tonight and myself, and many others sitting here would agree we're happy with the food and the service. Thank you."}
{"text":"Four stars because the French bread was amazing! Less than five because the French dip was only so-so."}
{"text":"One of my new faves when traveling thru PHX airport. On the hunt for something good to warm my belly and none of that airport junk, I actually trekked from across the other terminal, just to dine at Le Madeleine, and I am so happy that it didn't disappoint. The service is quick and courteous, and their chicken la Madeleine is a dish I'd return to order again. I saw some of the other patrons were enjoying their French pastries, quiche, and sandwiches as well. To add a personal touch, one of the cashiers came around the counter, to clean up an eating space and straighten it for an elderly customer to sit and dine. Mind you, there were still people on line waiting to order, but the fact that he did this heartwarming and without a thought, I just wanted to give him kudos. A plus in my book."}
