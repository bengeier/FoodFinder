{"text":"My absolute favorite spot for ramen, fried appetizers, and even sushi rolls. I love that they offer a little bit of everything because sometimes that's what I want. Its such a clean and neat place with the friendliest servers and chefs. Alan, who is a chef there is personable and knows how to take care of his guests. Every visit is like I'm seeing a friend while enjoying his creations.   My boyfriend loves the tonkatsu ramen there and I can't get enough of their chicken or pork katsu. So thin and crispy, paired with fluffy white rice is heaven. Try the croquettes for a solid snack or  octopus appetizer if you dare! Go with friends to order a bit of everything and eat family style or go on your lunch break for a quick and heart meal. It's great for all!"}
{"text":"Very clean, nice ambience. Was greeted very warmly. The ramen was soooo flavorful. All of my friends ordered ramen so I had a chance to taste the different kinds offered on the menu. Each one had very flavorful broth and noodles. I also ordered a side of chicken teriyaki with my ramen which was also very tasty and flavorful. And the best part, the chicken was not smothered in a ton of sticky teriyaki sauce. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a decent ramen shop ever since I got back from Japan. I knew I wouldn't find the the exact thing here, but after 5+ years and 3 other shops later I've finally found my shop. The staff and atmosphere are very friendly."}
{"text":"Ramen Dozo is the ramen-centric outpost of nearby Izakaya Dozo, a popular local spot focused on Japanese bar food. My wife and I usually went there for the robatayaki, the grilled items, but apparently the ramen was such a big seller, they've farmed it out into its own restaurant. The portions here are generous; the noodles firm, the soup rich in taste. I miss the spicy miso ramen featured at other places, but, small oversight. We recently tried the \"hot rock\" appetizer, which is a deep fried shiitake mushroom stuffed with crab salad and sriracha sauce, that was pretty tasty, although opening night blues served it up slightly cold instead of hot. We also tried a geso kara age, fried squid tentacles -- the coating on these was light and crisp, although it'd be better if the geso were split up from their cluster to make it easier to pick up and eat. The accompanying mustard and lemon mayo was quite delicious. This is a welcome addition to the growing list of ramen spots in the East Valley and look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"We tried this place today and thought it was excellent! The place is super clean and the staff is awesome! They treated our kids on the first japanese adventure!! The sushi was very fresh and super tasty!!!"}
{"text":"The waitress is sweet and attentive. Sushi chef is skillful and thoughtful about his products."}
{"text":"Although it was very busy, the servers were all very friendly and nice the whole time. We ordered chicken kastsudon, pork katsudon, and unaju donburi- the chicken was nicely fried and sweet! I would visit again ."}
{"text":"This is truly a hidden gem. The restaurant is tucked away in a shopping center that you wouldn't think twice to look at. But believe me the food is delish! Every time we come in the service is great and the food is yummy. Whether you get some tempura, sushi rolls, or my favorite (ramen soups) it is perfect for every occasion. Also, happy hour is after 5!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place first time here and I'm definetly coming back.. the staff is AMAZING manager AWESOME"}
{"text":"Second time here with my girlfriend, the service is friendly and the food is great. I got miso ramen with pork and it hit the spot! My girlfriend got Tonkotsu ramen which was also great. Definitely think we found our new ramen spot, can't wait to come back again"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch places in Tempe. Great service, and onr of the few places that does really good ramen AND really good sushi. Look forward to coming here every week."}
{"text":"I laughed when I saw that this place is directly across the street from Tampopo. I'm a fan of Tampopo's ramen so I figured I needed to try Dozo to compare the two.  First off, Dozo has a lot more on their menu than just ramen including poke bowls and sushi among other dishes. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with extra pork and the portions were huge. Noodles were yummy and I liked the broth. The pork was different than tampopo in that it was thicker and not as seared on the outside. It was tender and a solid serving size for the price.  The wait staff was very attentive and one of the cooks stopped by our table to ask us if we liked everything. They have a small bar area and then regular dining tables so this place has a bit more elbow room than Tampopo.   Both Dozo and Tampopo have things that make them stand out and you can't go wrong with either place. I'm sure I'll be coming back to Dozo for more ramen and to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"Their ramen is the best I've had in Tempe. They have great sashimi and Allen is super nice! He answers all questions about their fish and I had the best fresh wasabi here! I've never had it before, but it will keep me coming back. To top it all off, they have some fun mochi flavors too!  Their interior is neat, spacious, and the ambience makes this a great place to wind down with dinner after a work night or have a relaxed, intimate conversation for date night. Give it a shot! I'd recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I would give a 5 but the service was a little slow and the server seems overwhelmed for how slow it was. It's their grand opening.  We enjoyed the ramen. The taste was better than their close competitor.  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Ramen is ok. Was the only thing I tried and it was still opening week so got a 15% off of the ticket. Less than $10. That's reasonable. Would come back if in neighborhood and with friends. Service was pretty solid though. Saw a lot of people coming in and out, though non-Asians (is that racist?)."}
{"text":"Very tasty fresh noodles and vegetables. So full need to be rolled out of the restaurant. I wish they had a kids dish, but the chef/owner adjusted the veggies for kids flavors. They gobbled it up. The relaxed environment made us feel welcomed and I wouldn't hesitate to make it a date night for a quick dinner before a movie or something. Very chill atmosphere.We will be back!"}
{"text":"My friend took me to this really nice, chill \"hole-in-the-wall\" ramen place. This is my first time ever trying ramen, so it is really hard to compare this to other places. But I definitely enjoyed.   I ordered the Tonkastu ramen with pork and for an additional $4.50 I ordered the pan-fried gyoza (5 pcs). My friend ordered the same ramen and for an additional $4.50 she ordered the California roll (8pcs).   The Tonkastu ramen is the most popular dish they have. The broth was very tasty and not too salty. The pork was very tender. The pan-friend gyoza gave the potstickers a nice crunch to it.   5 stars because the employees were so friendly and our waitress was very helpful with any questions I had."}
{"text":"I love this place so much, great service, great food, great environment. I ordered tonkatsu ramen with out pork belly and extra egg, and no onion, no sprout. Its so yummy and tasty. I definitely enjoyed it. The best ramen in town here."}
{"text":"This is the best ramen I've had. I've been to other ramen places in town and there's no comparison. The prices are decent and you always get more than what you paid for. I've never been able to finish one bowl of ramen, even though I share with two of my kids. Lol. Everything on the menu is delicious, the tonkastu ramen is my favorite. Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen, great price!  the broth is just right and not to salty.   Def quality, they close though from 230 to 5...  would suggest :)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The first visit was perfectly fine. Good food good atmosphere good service. The sushi chef at served us at the bar and he was excellent. So I decided to return. My second experience was very strange to say the least. The waitress kept awkwardly touching my friend and I and interjecting herself into our conversations. At one point she leaned around to look at my friend phone as he was using it and asked about the screens content. We gave her a credit card to pay, then she returned 5 minutes later and asked how we'd like to pay. We told her that we already have her a card. She proceeded to search the pockets of her jeans to find it. Just before leaving, she again became a little too touchy, scratching everyone's backs with her fake nails. It was very uncomfortable.  I like the food here and would give his place four stars if it weren't for this one experience. This experience in isolation was two stars. I averaged to three."}
{"text":"Overall, decent ramen place. I had the miso ramen with tofu and husband had the tonkatsu ramen with an order of gyoza. Noodles were al dente just the way I like them. The miso broth was on point and would not change anything about it. However, the tonkatsu broth needed just a tad bit more of flavor. The gyoza was pretty tasty and was pan fried to perfection. We had the green tea ice cream for dessert and it was so creamy with just the right amount of green tea flavor. Also, they have friendly servers. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Okay so I was looking forward to showing my family the deliciousness of Tampopo but they were closed. Dad still wanted Ramen so we thought we were settling for the next best thing. WE WERE SO WRONG. Coming here is not settling at all. We ordered alot of stuff (family of six we tend to order half the menu at most places lol) We ordered the hot rock, Takoyaki, Two bowls for Ramen with pork broth for me and my dad, sushi with spicy tuna and yellow tail for my brother and Mom, and my other brother got Beef Yakisoba. Needless to say everything tasted amazing. The takoyaki especially, still having dreams about it over here haha. I'd say alot more variety than Tampopo has. Service was also very good, we were a little confused about the menu at first, but our server Wanda helped us out without much trouble. She even brought my brother a new plate when he was being an idiot and dropped his soda on his food on accident. To sum it up this place is amazing, and we will definitely be back! TRY THE TAKOYAKI!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this ramen place in Phoenix! This ramen shop rivals the ramen in Little Tokyo in LA!  I got the spicy miso ramen, but wish I had gotten the normal tonkotsu broth. While I usually love spicy, the tonkotsu broth had a really nice depth of flavor and richness that was masked by the miso in my opinion. Also the addition of miso made the broth a little to salty for my liking.  The soft boiled egg was PERFECT!! The noodles were also perfectly cooked.  The bowl comes with bean sprouts, and bamboo shoots and I choose the pork option. The pieces of chashu were thick and had a Smokey bbq flavor that was surprising, but that I liked.  They have a happy hour that runs from 5-6:30. We got a spicy tuna roll with lots of fish and just a small amount of rice...I approve! I think that was about $4.95. A large bottle of beer that could serve 2-3 was around $5 as well at the happy hour pricing.  Truly loved this bowl!"}
{"text":"Better noodles, better ingredients, Papa Ramen Dozo's. The staff is great and the food is incredible. Owner is a great guy, very professional, very prompt and welcoming every time."}
{"text":"Excellent for a new place. Friendly service. Definitely doing a 2nd visit, soon."}
{"text":"I've been on a ramen world tour of the phx area and this is by far the best place I've been to. I lived in LA for over 20 years so I grew accustomed to real ramen. Most places in the valley serve their best effort and it is generally not bad by any means, but they are normally sushi joints, so i understand.   The first time I visited they were out of tonkotsu broth (my personal favorite) so I went with the spicy miso. It was great so I knew that I had to come back to try the tonkotsu. I ordered a side of chicken karaage (another dish most places here dont offer), and it was great!  My second visit I was able to try the Tonkotsu and was not disappointed, I ordered it with extra pork and egg, because the standard portion is only half an egg and who doesnt love extra pork. The egg is always perfectly done and never too cooked and the pork melts in your mouth.  Best ramen in arizona"}
{"text":"I saw this place had a decent review on Yelp, so decided to come here for lunch. My friend ordered the spicy miso ramen with spicy tuna roll combo. Based on his review (I didn't try myself), the ramen was very good - definitely one of his top favorites in the valley. The chef recommended getting the tonkotsu plus extra spicy next time. So will have to make a trip back again.   I ordered the poke don. It took a while to come out but the cook was being pleasant about it so I didn't mind it. He even added extra avocado and octopus to my don. Yay free toppings :). Overall it was a pleasant experience. Would definitely come back again and try the ramen myself."}
{"text":"Tried it today for the first time Best Ramen we have ever eaten we will be back!  Food and service excellent!"}
{"text":"Love the tempura udon, it's my all time favorite from Ramen Dozo!! The udon itself is chewy and the soup base is very nice, too! The service and food deserve five stars!"}
{"text":"Plentiful and flavorful.  Their tonkotsu broth was rich without being overly fatty or salty, and their noodles were tender but chewy just how I like them.  The place itself is a little sparse, but that's to be expected from a small brand new restaurant.  The service was attentive and friendly, and the price was right.  I'm still not sure whether this one or Tampopo is better, but I like that I even have to make that decision."}
{"text":"Great food and the owner/manager is always very nice and accommodating. Ramen is the bomb and so is the sashimi salad! Love it!"}
{"text":"Very nice place great food and service.  Tonkotsu ramen may have been a bit heavy handed on dashi or katsuobushi for my liking but chashu was nice and the egg was spot on!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell:  great for Japanese comfort food.    Been coming to Ramen Dozo for some time now and it has been excellent every time.   My husband and I stumbled upon this place on our way back from California and decided to give it a try.  I think we came in on their opening weekend.  First off, they have my favorite base: shio.  It has been hard to find outside of Cali and I was surprised to see it in the menu.  Then I tasted it and I was in heaven.  It was and continues to be delicious.  There is the right amount of salt. Their ramen is the curly kind so another plus.  Portions are generous.  They also have shoyu, miso, and tonkotsu.  All of them are good but my favorite will always be shio.  Their sushi, while limited, is always fresh and hits the spot.  Love their yellow tail.  Their chef and overall service is always great.  They are polite and attentive.  It is a great place to come on your own and with family."}
{"text":"Just making my way around the many different ramen spots around town and landed here  .  I order the spicy miso ramen with the pork goyza and both excellent !! The ramen was subtle and flavorful and the goyza with crispy and tasty  .  I definitely will be back for the next round"}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4 stars. My sister and I were craving ramen and found this place on Yelp near her house. While the weather here in Phoenix is not exactly cold weather, it just seemed right to get noodles and broth. We both did not enjoy Tampopo so we knew we needed to try a new place.   When we showed up, there were a few other tables there. We were greeted upon arrival and seated within a minute.   For an appetizer, we chose the octopus balls and we both decided on the tonkotsu. My sister added tofu to hers and I kept mine the way it was. I thought the noodles were perfect and the the pork was tasty. The egg was perfectly soft-boiled as well.   We probably wouldn't get the octopus balls again. It showed up after we got our ramen and the mushy texture didn't do it for us. It was interesting but I was expecting more octopus.  Everyone seemed very friendly and the menu is reasonably priced. We will be back."}
{"text":"I love Ramen! I like this place better than Tampopo as the broth is more flavorful. However, they could improve their Udon broth. Their tonkatsu is awesome! I love Dozo (not the same place as this) and I can say their flavors are similar. I tried a udon and ramen on my first visit and will come back for the ramen.  Thanks for the late open hours! I wish more places would stay open late."}
{"text":"Ramen Dozo is a new Japanese restaurant featuring ramen, sushi, and other Japanese fare. I've had the agedashi tofu, geso karaage, soft shell crab tempura, chirashi bowl, and tonkotsu chashu ramen. The geso karaage (calamari with mustard mayo) was particularly good. The ramen was flavorful without being too salty. The fish for the chirashi were good cuts. The restaurant has a welcoming contemporary feel."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, we were originally going to Tampopo Ramen across the street.  Thing is, we had a party of 20 since we all came from the Matsuri festival.  But if you've been to Tampopo, you know that seating for 20 is impossible.  So we called Ramen Dozo and asked if they could seat 20.  They said yes, and the rest is history.  We showed up and tables were pushed together for all 20 of us to be seated together.  The food came out in a timely manner.  I think I ordered a tofu appetizer and chicken katsu.  Not sure.  I remember that I enjoyed it, although perhaps slightly disappointed by the portion size of the tofu.  Our group was loud and probably obnoxious.  But we had a really great time, especially since we were seated by a TV playing American Ninja Warrior and we were cheering as if we were watching some sports event.  Probably would have given a 4/5, but it's 5/5 since the service was excellent.  Hats off to the staff for being patient and cool with our group."}
{"text":"My buddy & I tried this place last night before an event. He had the ramen, while I went ham on the sushi. I got the goyza, calimari, Vegas roll, dragon roll, spicy tuna, & the nega hama.  I should had listen to my tasted buds but I was just to hungry after work & we were going to an event after so I just deal with it.  The moment when you tried the eel sauce, dragon roll, & Vegas roll it doesn't even taste like what all the other sushi places. They had a weird flavor to it, but being hungry I power through.  Left the event early cause I felt sick, now I am powering through FOOD POISONING. For a 4stars review on yelp you would think people would mention that the popular specialty rolls would had a unique flavor to it.  I advice no one to go here, from one foodie to the next. You have been warned!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place, took a shot in the dark. Staff is attentive and friendly, food is awesome!! Had the tonkatsu ramen wonderful vary well balanced and flavorful, what ever they do to their pork is definitely above the rest!!!"}
{"text":"Yes ,I have been waiting for this place to open so I can try the Ramen,although the noodles are not made there there made in Arizona somewhere else  .service was great lil bit overwhelming but nice set up for it's location,suahi is a tad bit wal mart style .maybe once .maybe twice I will return,I do know that there are better venues in this area.try it and find out the place for your self."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch. The service was prompt and friendly. We both ordered bentos. I got the teriyaki salmon and a California roll. My partner ordered the Katzu chicken and a yam and avocado roll. Both bentos came with miso and salad. The portion size was large. Everything was solid, though nothing was outstanding. Two complaints--it was a thick piece of salmon but it wasn't quite cooked through. I don't love mayo anything on my Japanese food and would have preferred any other dressing on my salad. We'll give it another go try other dishes."}
{"text":"I love this place so much that I would eat here alone or with friends! By far one of the best ramen shops I've had. My personal favorite is the spicy miso. Sometimes the restaurant can get too busy and won't have enough wait staff working so be patient. However, if it is sort of empty, seat yourself and wait for deliciousness to come to you!"}
{"text":"I LOOOVE THEIR FRIED RICE! I've been trying to find a place that makes good fried rice and I've always been disappointed, however, Ramen Dozo is something else. It's so amazing and delicious. Everyone go try it and be amazed. Also, the ramen is great too, one of the bests that I've tried in Tempe.   On top of great food the service is amazing and everyone is very friendly. You will always feel welcome when you eat there."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Had the Shoyu Ramen and Poké Don for dinner. The service and kitchen were extremely friendly. I would recommend everyone try this establishment for yourselves."}
{"text":"Best/most authentic ramen I've had in AZ. I just got back from living in Japan, so I'm quite picky--I'm not saying this place is perfect, but definitely better than Tampopo (my personal least favorite around here), Umami, and Nishikawa. The tonkotsu ramen broth tasted a little different than what I'm used to, but I preferred the noodles to what is offered in other restaurants around here. The chashu was very thick and pretty tasty. The gyoza was also decent, and my fiancé ordered the Japanese pork sausage, which was surprisingly good. We were a little bummed that they were out of nankotsu karaage, though. :(  Service was great; very attentive, always asking if I needed a refill and if everything was tasting okay. As soon as I took my straw out of it's wrapping, they were taking away the trash. Very good service. The happy hour prices are also good."}
{"text":"I'm dissapointed with the flavor and quality of the ramen. The Spicy Miso was hardly spicy at all, and the base believe it or not was almost flavorless. The tuna poke was slightly above average, while the noodles taste like packaged \"Top Ramen\". Gyoza was painfully average. I would not come again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for Ramen in Tempe. My favorite is the spicy miso ramen. They've all been delicious. All the appetizers I've had have been great and their service is great. Very attenti"}
{"text":"First time eating \"real\" ramen in AZ and overall I thought it was very good. The waitress was amazing. She knew the ins and outs of the entire menu (I had lots of questions) and made it much easier to figure out what I would like. I didn't give it 5 stars cause I know there's better ramen out there. I had some in other states that would blow this one away, but it's good. You won't be disappointed!  Looks like an interesting place from the outside, but I was pleasantly surprised by the interior."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! The service was very poor. I counted 12 diners when I was waiting for my meal. There were 3 runner/servers. The table next to me had 6 people and they were all getting their meals probably 10-15 minutes apart. I ordered the ramen combo and it took 35 mins for the ramen and another 25 mins after for my roll. I had to ask the server about my roll, she had no idea my tables order. The servers were focusing on the to go orders more than the guest there. It's a shame cause the food was very good. They are a new place and I hope they work on the service."}
{"text":"Bottom line: GO HERE. SUPPORT THIS DELICIOUS, LOCAL BUSINESS.  After nearly a year of waiting, I can finally write this review. After spending sometime in Japan (largely inspired by the quest for ramen) and sampling dozens of ramens from hole in the wall spots, to Michelin starred restaurants I feel like I can say with a certain amount of confidence that Ramen Dozo is the Bomb-en Dozo.   Their rames are delicious and taste so similar to even the Michelin starred ramens I had in Japan. While it's true, each person is unique in how much saltiness, richness, sweetness etc they like in their ramen, and each person will have a place that hits their needs bets, I think Ramen Dozo does a great job of offering something authentic and pretty universally likable.   Their tonkatsu ramen is rich and flavorful and the shiitake mushrooms I love to get with them are excellently prepared. I feel so lucky to have this little spot just right down the street from me. Of the 5 or so ramen places I've tried in the Phx/Tempe area Ramen Dozo is far and away the best. The service is extremely friendly and authentic even too, you can feel the love and care poured into the food. I should mention, everything is good, not just the ramen, the poke is fabulous, everything is, I just love ramen.  The only suggestions I could make are to put some beni shoga on the table because I can literally eat it by the spoonful and maybe offer a kae-dama (basically extra noodles!!!) option because their noodles are so yummy!   I'm so glad it's not Tuesday (they're closed!) because I can't wait to go get some Ramen Dozo later today! :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I ordered the spicy miso ramen with egg. It was delicious. Just the right amount of spicy. Lots of ramen, onion, bean sprouts and bamboo shoots. I ordered an extra egg but I really didn't need it because the portions were large. I had pork as my meat and it was very tender. Definitely will be back to try the sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi not big enough, for prize! I've been to a lot of 4 star Sushi and it's pricey, but the rolls are bigger than Ramen Dozo. Not going back."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best Ramen Restaurant I've eaten  in Tempe. I was greeted as soon as I entered the restaurant and  seated promptly. The tonkatsu ramen was on point. Everything from Noodle to broth ratio, noodle was el dante, pork was tender and Soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly. Not only was the food good. The atmosphere was great too. The mood light and having your own table makes the meal more intimate and delicious. I don't know about you but I don't like eating next to strangers :p"}
{"text":"Me and my husband went here. We had been wanting to find a great Ramen place. We have a lot to learn about Ramen but didn't think we really had a great experience yet. We tried a few places around the valley and one in Santa Clara, CA area while visiting family but were never close to being satisfied until now. Well at least my husband was...I eat GF- Gluten Free so have not found my niche but I will get there, hopefully. I think it will take some trial and error. Here is what we loved. They were patient about our questions, happy to explain everything and made great suggestions. The chef was very kind about figuring out something GF for me. Miso with rice noodles. It was good but I also have an issue with Soy, which I didn't mention, didn't want to make it so difficult. While I didn't love it, I will be back to try something else. My husband was absolutely blown away by the Tonkotsu and even though it's not GF, I had a taste and it was awesome. The pork melts in your mouth and the broth is amazing. If I could rate them 4 3/4 I would, gotta find something that works better for me next time. My husband gives them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best tonkotsu broth in the valley. Their noodles are pretty good too. The only reason this is a four star instead of a five star review is that the veggies and other additions could use some work. Seriously, their broth is so good, I had it three night nights in a row when I was sick, lol!"}
{"text":"My friends and i went here on our day off. Our chef was really attentive and helpful.  I would recommend the salmon fried rice. The jelly fish which i like but it was pretty salty and tiny."}
{"text":"I love Ramen Dozo!! Everything I've had here is good. Exclusively Japanese food, not fusion. I usually get the Ramen/sushi combo. Bento boxes make a great lunch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in America. The appetizers are delicious. The hand made ramen is a must have experience."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time today, and it was really good! The service was great and the ramen and sushi were both pretty delicious. Will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here, and it took 5 min until someone came to give us a menu. Even to get us our check and drinks, it sucked.. As for the food, it was bland and after every bite, I was not looking forward to taking the next. I was really excited to try this place and just the ramen concept in general, and it was VERY disappointing. Don't think I will try this kind of ramen again and I know that I will not try this place again!"}
{"text":"OMG OMG..  Our group  from work was so looking forward to this new ramen house. The atmosphere and decor was reasonable. We started with fried rice, it was pork and tasted  sweet with sugar and mush. So not appealing and none of us could eat it. The noodles did not appear to be handmade.. seemed like package ramen noodles. They served the noodles in a plastic bowl and the broth tasted like plastic. The meal and service was poor. The waiter never came back to even ask if we wanted drink refills. So sad. Our office lunch group voted this place off our lists."}
{"text":"We didn't walk in with very high expectations and maybe that helped this review.  The atmosphere wasn't especially appealing as it felt more office like, and the seating arrangement made it feel a bit impersonal. The food was just so-so but we didn't order so much. The donkatsu ramen had a nice texture to both the broth and texture of the noodles. Where i was disappointed was the takoyaki (squid balls) which were very doughy inside and didn't have that initial subtle crunch when you bite into them. The veg tempura was flavorless and the sauce didn't add much. Wait staff might have been understaffed a bit or else it just takes a really long time for bills to print."}
{"text":"We went right at opening time and ordered the Shoyu Ramen, the Fat Cat Roll, the Hot Rock appetizer, and a Dragon Roll. Overall, the food was very good. Ramen broth was very flavorful, noodles were al dente, served with 1 piece of pork and a half egg. Service was prompt and attentive. Lots of different food choices and only a handful of Ramen. Definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu offerings."}
{"text":"Im a ramen conasuir. I've been eating all the ramen spots in town. This is the best!!!. Tampopo is right across the street, and it's decent. Ramen dozo is ten times better. Staff is super chill. Great music and lots more options than just ramen. Noodles are perfection, I prefer the slightly thicker wavy noodles, unlike the thin straight noodles some other spots. Broth is so good you can drink alone and not need anything else. Soft boil eggs on point. XXX chili oil is the fire."}
{"text":"Great stuff, the place is s little small inside but we enjoyed our visit there. The food was really very good!"}
{"text":"My most preferred ramen in Arizona so far. Direct comparisons to Tampopo are inevitable due to proximity, but the two styles are very different. I've had the chance to have the shio, shoyu, and tonkotsu up to now and have never been disappointed. There is something consistently good about the soup and the noodles that makes it flavorful and rich without making you feel heavy afterwards. Plenty of enjoyable sides to beef up your meal, such as gyoza, takoyaki, gesoyaki, a moderate sushi selection, etc. However, a single bowl is enough to call it a meal in most cases. The staff has always been attentive, kind, and open to answering questions as well.  For a traditional bowl of ramen, I think this is among the best you'll find in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We love the ability to pop into a little spot, grab a quick meal and continue the evening. This places far exceeded our expectations. It was reasonably priced and they have a happy hour menu. ;) we were waiting for a cool little restaurant to open up in this location.   The server was a delight, she was entertaining and enthusiastic and kept the experience at its peek. We opted to try the menu. It's money well spent-   Chicken cooked absolutely perfect with a side of BBQ sauce.   Ramen......- A m a z I n g . . . We have been to a few other local spots. And this one takes the bag. We will come back again for another happy hour. The whole team there was in a good mood and the atmosphere was perfectly balanced with lighting and music levels."}
{"text":"Solid four star for me after trying here once.   Tried their tonkotsu ramen and it is not like traditional tonkotsu ramen you might get in Kyushu Japan, but flavor is defiantly good, I still enjoyed it. Flavor is very similar to miso ramen you might get in Japan. Noodle they used was thick version, often served with shio or miso ramen. Noodle was cooked perfect, I enjoyed the texture. Although I liked their broth, it would have been better if soup was hotter (temperature hot). If I am in the area, I would ask my broth to be really hot next time.  Gyoza was served with hot dipping sauce. It wasn't my favorite kind.  I tasted gyudon and flavored well. I also tasted tempura and thought could improve tempura batter.   Service was good, even a chef came out and asked if everything was good. It seemed like a lot of regular there when I visited.  I would come back again if I am in the area"}
{"text":"If you like ramen, you gotta go.....If you don't like ramen, you gotta try!  We're always looking for good ramen in the valley, and have eaten a lot of ramen in LA (Little Tokyo, Sawtelle).  For me, this is the best ramen I have had in the valley.  We had Tonkatsu Ramen (they have combos where you can add sushi rolls, etc at a discounted price).  Broth was very satisfying, soft boiled egg was done to perfection and the portion/tenderness of the pork was excellent.  The server was a little stressed, but one of the cooks (possibly an owner) jumped in and helped us out.  Decor was simple & tasteful and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Got here around 5:30 and this place was starting to get pack the only room I saw was at the bar for 4 people.  I snagged that up real quick so we had a place to eat.  They were so sweet to allow us to move to the table when it was ready. The green Iced Teas were very good but they're don't offer refills.  Have the regular Ramen and it was pretty good. The gyoza was okay as well.  The service was good but a little bit slow but then again they were very slammed."}
{"text":"I tried this place two times and both times their ramen was a disappointment. I've tried the tonkotsu and spicy miso ramen and I was definitely not satisfied. Their chicken katsu curry was alright."}
{"text":"Love this place, I have been here twice and I gotta say the ramen is on point! You also get a decent portion size as well! Customer service doesnt really matter to much to me but, for those of you that care about customer service; the staff very are friendly and attentive as well.  On with the food....  I've had  the tonkatsu ramen twice and it was just as good as the first time indicating consistency. The broth was flavorful, not salty  at all, in fact it has a perfect balance, it's salty enough to have flavor, but not so salty that you can't sip all the broth. Everyone has their  preference on noodles, however these noodles thin, and medium soft, not hard but not soft. The meat was ridiculously soft!! It was so good!   If your reading this, don't think just go! Now! It's a must try!"}
{"text":"I dont usually give reviews. First time here, me and my friends waited 45 minutes at least for at best mediocre ramen and pork katsu. Ugh. Flavor was flat. Do yourself a favor and go to Tampopo ramen across the street. My overall experience was dreadful."}
{"text":"By far, the best Ramen in AZ! Since moving here from Hawaii a a year and a half ago, I've been on an ongoing quest for good, authentic ramen. I suppose I took it for granted in Hawaii, because it is everywhere there. I've been to many ramen restaurants in AZ in e last year and a half, and all came up short on some way, until Ramen Dozo. The broth is great, you can tell there is a lot that has gone into making it, and it's not oversaturated with unnecessary weird toppings. The Charsiu is also good, which is a good indicator of a good ramen shop. This has now become my go-to ramen shop. Oh, not to mention, you can also get some decent sushi and other great appetizers. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I love the Yam & Avocado Sushi. You can add it on as a combo with your ramen.  If you ask for vegetarian ramen they will withhold any meat products from the soup broth! The Bento Boxes offer a great variety, as well. Wonderful place for the sushi lover & the ramen lover!"}
{"text":"Visited because of other reviews.  Ramen was good.  Delicious broth veggies & noodles.  Price is fair.  Hidden gem in Tempe.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"Very friendly new ramen shop, definitely a good addition to the neighborhood. Will be back for another meal for sure."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and amazing Ramen! I go here a lot and usually pick-up an order that I called in.  The manager is very helpful and I always get my order in time. It is delicious and a nice, hearty, healthy meal. I usually get the vegetarian broth ramen with tofu and udon noodles.   I always have a good experience here and have been a regular for about 6 months now."}
{"text":"small but lovely place. excellent customer service also. ordered salmon sashimi, takoyaki, katsu and ramen. the food tasted great. nongreasy. will come again"}
{"text":"I had the spicy miso with tofu. The broth was basically spicy water and tasteless. I was also given a large ball of cabbage and onions, which is normal for ramen. But when you have more cabbage/onions than noodles, that's a problem. My boyfriend got their tonkotsu, and was thrilled to see such large, thick pieces of chashu. However, he was met with disappointment when he bit into them. It was tough, and didn't fall apart easily and melt in your mouth like traditional chashu does. We're not even picky about ramen but this was just not good.  I wanted to give two stars but decided to add one back because their takoyaki was delicious, and actually had octopus in every bite. Also the eggs that accompanied the ramen was cooked perfectly! I just wish the broth was good enough to enhance it.  My search for the perfect bowl of ramen continues..."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here many times since its recent opening, and this place is consistently great. I routinely order the chicken & veggie udon - perfect amount of food, very satisfying. My husband is a more adventurous eater and has ordered nearly everything on the menu at this point - he says everything has been delicious! Love the cozy atmosphere here, and the owner is wonderful! 10/10 would/do recommend to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Very good miso and tonkatsu ramen!! Very friendly staff and nice atmosphere. Really recommend this place over tonpopo across the street."}
{"text":"Small but cozy spot- not much seating available, but it wasn't too packed when we came here for dinner. We ordered the pork katsu, which was decent but a little too dry, and the tonkotsu ramen, which I would recommend. The broth was very flavorful and chasu tasted delicious, but contained quite a bit of fat. The noodles were enjoyable. I would rate this ramen to be better than Tampopo's ramen (Tempe), but not as good as Nishikawa's ramen (Chandler)."}
{"text":"After several errands, it was time to eat.  This appeared as a new place to try, so we did.  This is located on a strip mall on the McClintock side. The area is dark.  Once we arrived and walked in, it was a nice medium size restaurant with a few tables of diners.  We were immediately greeted by our server.  She provided answers to any of our questions.  We had Hot Rock (Shitake mushroom, crab & tuna), salmon skin, takoyaki (octopus pancake ball) appetizers. I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen with a very rich & flavorful pork bone broth spicy. Very good food & Awesome Service (Briana B)!!!  I will be back, no questions asked for the food, but just the service is enough to come back."}
{"text":"Awesome addition to the neighborhood. Food has been excellent each time I have visited. The tonkotsu ramen is some of the best I have tried and the portions are large. Add a sushi roll or some pan fried gyoza for a few dollars more to make it a combo."}
{"text":"This was on my list of togo places since it is new, but after a good friend of mine told me she's been and it was THE BEST ramen in PHX, I had to check it out right away! Got there with a friend a bit after lunch time, so was easy to find seating. We were greeted right away as we walked in and the server brought us waters right away since it's hot out. We started with the Takoyakis and ordered a tonkatsu ramen, a spicy miso ramen with a teriyaki bowl. Everything was perfectly prepared and was SO GOOOD!!! The Tonkatsu is the best I've had in Phoenix, much more flavorful than Hachi Ramen. The Takoyakis were super hot, came right out to our table so be careful when eating them - these had plenty of tako in them. The server kept our water refills and checked on us from time to time. Chef Alan even came out to ask the customers how they were liking the food, and he was such a nice guy to check on us since we were first timers. I would definitely make this place a routine stop for my lunch break!"}
{"text":"I LOVE ramen and this Ramen Dozo was one of the places my boyfriend and I had to try when it first opened.  I had the tonkotsu ramen and he got the spicy miso. I really really loved the tonkotsu broth; it tasted to authentic and creamy and smooth and you get a good portion too! He didn't really like the spicy part of the miso ramen, but when we came again he got the normal miso and loved it as well; the spicy-ness kind of tastes like oil that doesn't really go with the ramen broth.    I like this particular spot because they have options to customize your ramen and even make them vegetarian which I think is pretty cool. One thing I wish they could've done was make the menu in japanese. I understand that there are a lot of Chinese people in Tempe, but I was expecting more of an authentic menu (really really small minor detail, but it bothers me for some reason! lol)   Other than that this is my favorite ramen restaurant in tempe right now! I would suggest it to anyone who loves ramen :)"}
{"text":"When you walk in you feel instantly welcomed. The owner is right there making sushi, hosting, coming out to wipe down tables and seat you personally. The food is for lack of a better word...AMAZING!! The sushi is perfect. Miso soup is perfectly balanced. I have major respect for this place."}
{"text":"The best Ramen in the PHX area! The Tonkotsu Chashu Ramen solid. The egg is done correctly, the chashu is tasty and the broth is savory. The Spicy Miso Ramen has a good burn and spiciness. The Gyoza pan fried have the right char on one side. Out of all the ramen joints in the are this place is leaps ahead. They have good happy hour pricing and plenty of seating. The staff are friendly and the just right amount of attentiveness. Domo ariganto."}
{"text":"I really like the ramen here because they have bone broth which has a way better flavor than the regular miso kind. They give you options for the protein too not just pork, chicken, but tofu or shrimp. The gyoza was delicious as well, crispy on the outside. The noodles are not home made but I would come back for that bomb broth!"}
{"text":"Loved the food here. I got a bento box with teriyaki chicken and gyoza. The bento boxes come with a lot of food and it all was great. The ramen is great and had awesome flavor. The staff was also great and friendly, would for sure recommend"}
{"text":"3.7 stars due to service but 4 for food. Delicious ramen. Sushi is mediocre. Place is decent size but not good for big group of 10+ people. Waiters will get overwhelm with big group like that. Make sure to confirm amount of people because they messed up our and only gave us 10 seats instead of 13 which caused a lot of movement and running around."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. I brought my 4-year old son and they tossed us a pack of cards to play with while we waited. They patiently answered all my questions and seemed to genuinely appreciate getting to share their food with us. I really enjoyed the spicy miso ramen and my son liked the pork fried rice. I also got the quail eggs for $1.75. At that price they were hard to pass up. Never had them before and I loved them. They were served in the shell and topped with something spicy and something tangy. Really refreshing. I couldn't crush my bowl of ramen because I was really stuffed, but I loved the flavor. I normally get pork bone broth, so miso is kinda new to me. I was really impressed. It had a really nice smokey flavor. I also noted a hint of basil with the soft boiled egg. I meant to ask how they seasoned it but didn't want to be to pretentious. Still, curious to know if those eggs were seasoned with basil or not (probably not). All in all it was a really fun and enjoyable stop on my ongoing discovery of Ramen in Arizona."}
{"text":"Prologue: My fiancee picked up a Chinese newspaper as she usually does when we're leaving Lee Lee Supermarket, saw an advertisement for this restaurant, and decided she wanted to give it a try for our weekly Saturday evening dinner date.   The Plot: I am most certainly a fan of Poke made with any kind of fish, including tuna of course, so we decided to start by sharing a Poke Tuna Salad. I also read a Yelp review that recommended the Hot Rock, so wanted to try that as well. Our salad and starter were followed by a bowl of Shoyu Ramen with Pork and a bowl of Miso Ramen with Chicken.   The Scene: My fiancee, despite being unfamiliar with Poke, absolutely loved this salad, as did I. As we know, Poke itself is a marinated and seasoned fish salad that consists mostly of fish and is immensely popular in Hawaii. However, this version was a little different and was more like a spring mix salad with vinaigrette dressing topped with tuna sashimi. Never the less, the taste was fresh and yummy and we quickly consumed every bite.  The Hot Rock consisted of Shiitake mushrooms topped with a mix of minced crab and spicy tuna and then deep fried. My fiancee was impressed with this rather unique creation and truly enjoyed them, which surprised me a little because she usually stays away from fried foods.  Both bowls of Ramen were filled nearly to the top with noodles and very nicely presented. Lots of noodles was, indeed, a welcome sight because we've been disappointed in the past when ordering Ramen at restaurants that try to fill you up with more broth instead. I would also have to agree completely with another Yelper who mention that the noodles at this restaurant are served 'al dente'. The consistency of the noodles was spot on for me, not at all mushy and not too chewy, which resulted in a meal that was easier to eat and more satisfying. The slice of pork in my bowl was very tender, juicy, and flavorful and I wished I had eaten the boiled egg a little sooner because it had become a little soggy by the time slurped it up.   The Rest of the Story: My fiancee and I agreed that both the Shoyu Ramen and the Miso Ramen relied too much on soy sauce and fermented bean paste, respectively, for flavor.  I happily finished my bowl of Shoyu Ramen because the noodles were very good. However, the only taste remaining on my palette by the end was the strong flavor of soy sauce.  It is true they have Pork Bone Broth on the menu as as well. However, we felt that the Shoyu and Miso broth could have been developed a bit more.  My fiancee also mentioned that her bowl had very little chicken.  The service was prompt and courteous and the prices were reasonable.   Epilogue: The quality and quantity of the noodles as well and the salad easily deserved 3 stars. We decided to not award a 4th start as a result of not having fallen in love with the Ramen as we had hoped.   Photo Design: by Billie Z."}
{"text":"The first time my fiancé and I went here, we had a wonderful experience. The place had customers, but it wasn't packed. That was about a month ago.   We loved it so much that tonight we took his mom and brother there. It started out with them telling us it would be a 10 minute wait. After about 40 minutes we were finally seated. Unfortunately a group of 10 sat down right before us. When the waiter came over to take our order, he informed us that the group of 10 had just placed their order and that if we wanted our order to be put before theirs, he would try and request it. My fiancé said that would be much appreciated. 20 minutes later, the table of 10 had been about halfway served. After 10 more minutes one person at our table received his food. By the time the rest of our orders came, he had finished. As we were waiting for the check, we noticed that one of the waitresses was putting out clean napkins and utensils on tables, but she was doing so using a dirty towel. That is a BIG no, no, in the restaurant business.  About halfway through my meal, my stomach started cramping and I began feeling very nauseated. Needless to say, all 4 of us ended up feeling sick to our stomachs and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service! My server David was knowledgeable, polite and friendly. The food was awesome, sushi and ramen are fantastic. This place is a nice small family owned place with great flavors and staff.  Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I was excited to see another ramen place opening up, but was confused why they would choose this particular shopping plaza which is right across the street from Tampopo Ramen, and in a less visible location with less foot traffic.  Turns out the name Ramen Dozo is a bit of a misnomer since this restaurant is more of an all purpose Japanese restaurant that has ramen in addition to sushi, donburi, and plate dishes. When I flipped through the menu I couldn't actually find any ramen until I looked towards the back!   We came during happy hour and indulged in some discounted rolls, appetizers, and I had a little of the tonkatsu ramen. Our appetizers were the jellyfish salad and hot stone dish. The jellyfish had the requisite chewy texture and was served with some cool refreshing cucumber. The marinade went well with both the jellyfish and the vegetable. The hot stone was a shitake mushroom topped with spicy tuna and crab, deep fried. Overall it was decent but the taste of the spicy tuna had an overpowering acidic flavor that some sweeter sauce on top (Maybe teriyaki or yuzu) would have made it taste more balanced.   I ordered the spicy tuna roll and yam avocado roll. They were pretty small pieces but for happy hour prices I didn't mind. The rice was cooked well, and out of the two I liked the yam roll better due the slight crunchiness from the deep fried tempura yam contrasting with the creamy cool avocado?. The spicy tuna roll had the same issue as the hot stone. The tuna had too much acidic (Vinegar?) flavor for me to enjoy the dish as a whole.   The ramen was a good portion, with al dente noodles, the wavy kind vs. Tampopo's straight thin noodles. The broth tasted pretty light (I think my favorite broth is still from Tampopo in the East Valley) but the pork was very tender and packed with a lot of flavor.  Service was slow initially but picked up later on. Our server was very sweet and friendly.  I probably would still go to Tampopo for my ramen fix but I were interested in other dishes found in Japanese cuisine I'd head over to Dozo (Especially during happy hour)!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place. I sat at the bar and had a chance to talk with the owner for a bit and he's a really cool guy. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and he hooked it up with some chili sauce! The pork was well marinaded and had a wonderful flavor. The broth lacked a little depth but that chili oil definitely helped it! The egg was amazing as well and done just right! Definitely have this place on my list as a regular stop."}
{"text":"The tonkotsu ramen is unbelievable! It has a light smokey flavor that I just fell in love with.  The noodles were delicious and not over cooked.  IF YOU WANT A REAL BOWL OF RAMEN GO HERE AND GET THE TONKOTSU!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! The owner and staff were exceptional!!! The noodle and the soup were rich and tasty.  Would come back again soon."}
{"text":"The first true culinary gem I found in Phoenix after moving to the city. By far the best Ramen I've ever had, I have tried their spicy miso (not that spicy but very good), tonkotsu ramen, and some of their sushi. The Ramen is where it's at, the broth is rich and satisfying and I always have it served with bean noodles instead of the regular ramen noodles.  The staff and owner are incredibly friendly and accommodating and can say that they deserve every bit of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and BRAND New in the Tempe District!  It is a HOT and NEW place to stop by. It just opened up last week Monday and the place is on fleek, meaning it's a nice modern ramen hang out. When we first pulled up into the parking place, the parking lot is kinda empty and dark, you can't really see inside the restaurant so I was hesitate if it was open even with the \"OPEN\" neon sign is brightly on. But, I'm glad we stayed, parked, and pulled the door open.    This new restaurant has a clean, modern look to the place and customer service is very welcoming. Service of food menu is just right with the exception of the sushi, which is always nice to have in a Ramen place besides feeling like you need a wheel barrel to wheel you out after eating so much. It is a nice family/friendly atmosphere with delicious food.  We had their Tonkatsu Pork Ramen - it was very tasty, the broth was really yummy as if it was marinated for at least 24 hrs before serving. Our sushi selection was great I want to say for the sushi we had the Las Vegas Roll and we were blessed to have tried their Hot Rock appetizer, it was delicious, especially for someone who doesn't like Shiitake mushrooms, hahahaha! It was amazing.  However, I do want to go back and try their Poke Tuna Don, from the pictures it almost seems like how we would make our Poke bowls back in Honolulu, big ole cube size and fresh. Plus, a few other items I saw such as Hamachi, chicken katsu, their sake selection, and etc. It seems like this will be a nice new spot to relax after a long weekend or even for a stop over for dinner during the week.  I"}
{"text":"First time here today and I am now a big fan. Today I got the Rock N' Roll and the spicy tuna, my go-to at any sushi place. They were amazing! I'll definitely be back to grab a full meal from them!"}
{"text":"Really good ramen! Great flavor. Clean atmosphere. Not the fastest service.  Got sesame balls to end the meal and they were good."}
{"text":"This was the best ramen I've tasted, so far. I got the pork bone broth ramen and an order of gyoza. The ramen was very rich and the noodles were nice and chewy. However, the pork meat was very dry and tough. The gyoza was amazing, very fresh tasting! The service is slow but the staff was very nice! Definitely give this a place a try if you're in the mood for good ramen!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but after my overall experience, I'd give it a 2.5, 3 stars at best. It was a Friday dinner and surprisingly, we got in without a wait which was awesome.  We got a little bit of everything on the menu. For appetizers, we ordered the chicken karage and vegetable tempura. For our entrees, we got miso ramen w/ chicken with a California roll combo and the spicy miso ramen w/ pork with a gyoza combo. We also got hot green tea. Out of everything we got, we only truly enjoyed the chicken karage, gyoza and vegetable tempura. Both the Ramen were so incredibly disappointing - the broth lacked flavor and was just so bland. My miso ramen also had a weird after taste so I honestly barely touched my ramen. While the appetizers were good, the ramen needs a lot of work.  Besides the food, the customer service was slow. They seem to have been understaffed on the floor despite it being a Friday night. Although we were seated immediately at the bar, we had to wait 30-40 mins for our actual food.  My experience here was disappointing and I honestly do not plan to come back."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try this place since it's close to my house. The sushi was great, service was friendly and prompt, the dishes and restaurant looked clean, the ramen was fantastic. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"While the pictures look good, don't be fooled. I got the tonkotsu ramen. The broth is so bland, I don't know what other people like about it. My chashu was tough and rubbery, it didn't fall apart easily. My egg had the right texture, but not the right flavor, it was off, too sweet and too salty at the same time. The noodles are too few. My girlfriend also ordered a miso Ramen that was too watery.  My experience was the way my ramen tasted, disappointing"}
{"text":"Great ramen stop in Tempe. We stopped in on a Saturday night around 7pm and had no wait for two. We both ordered the spicy miso which comes with a choice of pork, chicken, shrimp, or tofu. . I opted for the pork. It also comes with bean sprouts, green onion, seaweed, and half a soft boiled egg. The ramen came within 10 minutes and did not disappoint. The broth is not too spicy but they have chili oil to add if you want to amp up the heat. Overall, the flavor was awesome. The egg was cooked perfectly and the meat was tender. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Ramen you will get in Tempe and is very reasonable with the prices. I always get the Tonkatsu Ramen and ask for the extra spicy chili paste to add to it. The chili paste is very spicy so I only add a little and it does the job. The portions are huge and very filling, I usually only get a roll or appetizer if I'm sharing with someone. I go here all the time and the service and food is always amazing, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great service and presentation and i love that they have an option to make it vegetarian. The ramen tastes great and regularly inquired whether everything was good and also gave us some kind of chili oil/paste because our spicy ramen wasn't spicy enough at first. Only wish those marble sodas weren't so expensive for such a small size. Otherwise the ramen was affordably price and awesome"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, tasty ramen ! If you wanna try Tonkotsu ramen (pork), Ramen Dozo is a great place ! We also tried Yam&Abocado roll as a combination of ramen. Sushi was also tasty. I will definitely come back ;)"}
{"text":"The ramen is okay I order a miso with chicken the broths was really good but the noodles were bad a weird flavor towards them the service was excellent"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Absolutely delicious!! Amazing service! The chef owner Allen was great! It's hard to find a place with great food, service and an awesome owner! The salmon sashimi was outta this world! So was the spicy miso ramen."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of this restaurant fool you! The inside is quite vibrant! The food itself is great, we have tried many things on the menu such as, spicy miso ramen, the soy based ramen, the chicken katsu, pork katsu, and everything has tasted wonderful! The staff here is great, although it is a bit uncomfortable listening to the owner talk to his employees quite rudely while training. In other words, come for the food, sir far away from the owner if he is training somebody!"}
{"text":"Ramen please???? This is not a ramen restaurant this is a sushi restaurant that has a tiny tiny tiny section on their menu for ramen, why would you open a sushi restaurant and call it ramen dozo, after realizing this was not a ramen restaurant I left, seriously maybe they can change the name to ramen why? Cause we are a sushi joint, why not have one burger on the menu and they can be burger dozo! Go across the street there is an actual ramen spot they also put ramen in their name but they live up to it, arigato"}
{"text":"We went during happy hour today. I've passed by this place many times on Mclintock and was curious what Ramen Dozo had to offer. The plaza has a Dairy Queen Boston Market next to it. This place offers ramen and sushi combo's.   I ordered the Spicy Ramen. The ramen came with soft boiled egg, 1 slice of pork, this is definitely for spicy food eaters there was a lot of chili oil in the broth. We also ordered the shoyu ramen. The broth for both was pretty good. We were pleasantly surprised. Later our order of takoyaki came out. The octopus was nice and chewy but I think there should be less sauce.   The sushi:  We ordered One california roll  and One specialty Fat Cat Roll.  The Fat Cat had bits of unagi, cucumber, and spicy tuna. This roll was not bad but I think the mayo soy sauce should have been on the top.   The California roll (happy hour menu) was only about $4. It tasted pretty dry or the sushi rice wasn't very flavorful.   Verdict: Come for the ramen and maybe get the specialty rolls. It would be better if their menu had pictures of the different sushi. It was hard to picture what the sushi would look like.    Overall, we enjoyed this ramen place over Tampopo. (Tampopo is too bland and never has their appetizers.) Also, all the servers are very helpful and friendly. The owner also comes to greet us which was nice. My friend got a mochi ice cream on the house because we were celebrating her graduation. Thank you Ramen Dozo we will be back!"}
{"text":"First off.. The Ramen comes with the soft egg/runny, without special requests the way it should be always.. Thank You..  Tonkatsu Ramen, broth was on point. The braised meat was very good and the egg was perfect n runny yolk.. Delicious.. Now this was our 1st time here and will be back for sure.. They very well compete with the other local places..  Had the dumplings n they were good... But will be back to try other things..  Staff are very friendly, and ample room to sit down without being shoulder to shoulder with other customers.. Hahemmmm.. Lol.  Please keep your eggs runny n ignor the idiots who like it over cooked.. Cheers"}
{"text":"In my opinion Great ramen! Went there about 2 days ago in the evening. Staff was attentive. I got the shio ramen with the pork. It was nice and savory! Finished it down to the broth. Wish there was more!"}
{"text":"Definitely better quality for cheaper than its neighbor. I had the spicy miso and vegetable gyoza (Potstickers). They were both great. The miso wasn't too spicy or salty and it had a good ratio of veggies and noodles. The gyoza had a basil wrap that was very good. It was very surprising but it definitely worked. Service was awesome and everything was explained clearly."}
{"text":"Really glad this place opened. The owner is obviously very concerned with the quality of the food and the overall experience of his patrons. But there was something else special about this place, whether it was the \"realness\" of our server Wanda, who was so sweet and a delight to get to know, or the Sayuri Nigori sake they had on the menu (my GFs favorite) or the fancy Japanese beer I had never had that was also awesome, to the way they serve their Hamachi Sushi or prepare their Sunonono salad with Persian cucumbers. Will definitely be back. Kanpai Ramen Dozo and welcome to Tempe, glad you are here."}
{"text":"For a place that is trying to advertise its ramen, they could at least make sure that it's the best dish they offer.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best...Just \"ok\". I got the tonkotsu ramen, which is always what I try when trying to gauge how good a ramen is and the whole meal I was trying to figure out what was \"off\" about my ramen.  The charsiu in their ramen is really good, probably the best part. The broth was really peppery and reminded me too much of Republic Ramen. I am pretty sure everyone commenting on how \"flavorful\" the broth is, is just being fooled by the pepper. The worst part was the noodles, which there weren't nearly enough of. If I don't struggle to finish the rest of the toppings/broth after I finish my noodles, then it wasn't enough. And just so I don't sound like a Big Pig American, this was my experience in Japan every time I ate ramen--I struggled to finish it and often couldn't because it was so filling.   It felt like there was just more cabbage and bean sprouts than noodles. Some of the toppings also just tasted \"off\" to me and just not what I'm used to. The egg tasted like it was done in a sweet marinade but it was too sweet, and the menma were oddly rubbery.  I liked that you could get ramen combos and the gyoza was really tasty. The waitress even recommended to us to get the combo for the gyoza instead of the appetizer, because it would save some money.  I would definitely be willing to go back and try their other menu items, because the menu is actually really large and offers some things that are harder to find in AZ. But I don't think I would order their ramen again."}
{"text":"So me and roommate love to check out new ramen places so we came down to try this one. The restaurant is clean and neat. We ordered miso ramen with pork. The broth was very tasty and strong . I liked it but it was almost a little to heavy for me. It wasn't the best ramen I've ever had but it is worth trying if your craving ramen. The only suggestion I would make to the soup is to add more of the ingredients . The pork belly was small, it was a half an egg instead of a whole one and very limited bamboo shoots and limited cabbage. I don't like my soup jammed with crap but it woulda been nice to have a little more content in my soup. I do suggest trying it but maybe add an extra pot belly. Our server was very sweet and friendly but a little on the slow side which I understand though she was the only one working."}
{"text":"Are they Tampopo's competition since they're right across the street? lol. I definitely wanted to compare the two places when I saw this one. I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen with pork. I added corn to it. It was a good sized portion. I wish that they had more options for the additional toppings. The broth was good and so was the noodles. I always like my noodles to be a bit thicker when i have ramen. I think the price was also pretty standard for ramen. If I were to choose between them and Tampopo I'd say it's a tie. Customer service was also very good and we got seated right away. I would come back for more ramen. =) They also have happy hour I believe. However, I think their happy hour hours are limited."}
{"text":"The ramen was good. I got the shiyou (?) And it was delicious! It was very salty but the name literally translates to salt sooo. If you're sensitive to salt I wouldn't recommend that type of broth. The broth was nice and hot. I also got their veggie pot stickers and those were amazing!   The staff was super friendly too. The woman we had as our server was kind, attentive, and funny. I'd go back just because how welcoming it was.  And don't worry if you don't know much on the menu, they'll offer help to describe the menu"}
{"text":"We had a bento box, spicy salmon, and seaweed salad. Honestly, it was incredible. Very fresh, classic flavors done right. To top it all, they gave us strawberry and chocolate mochi balls for dessert.   10/10 would eat again."}
{"text":"We came here during the grand opening (everything was 15% off).  The food was great! The ambiance of the restaurant is really nice too- small and cozy, and all the chefs were very friendly and welcoming.  Going to a new restaurant during their first few weeks can always be a little awkward. The servers were nice, although seemed a little overwhelmed (Saturday night with only two servers and the restaurant was full). Also the server we had seemed a little confused by items on the menu.  Not a deal breaker- but definitely would be a good idea as a server to familiarize yourself with the menu a bit more- especially at a new restaurant where diners are likely to ask a lot of questions.   We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was first time we tried here and we loved the every single food that we ordered. They have good customer service too. I will definitely come back here :)"}
{"text":"I highly recommend Ramen Dozo to get the authentic ramen fix. The broth is full of flavor and noodles are cooked to perfection. The toppings are delicious as well. I had the shoyu ramen while the hubby had the tonkatsu ramen. Tonkatsu broth was better but shoyu was good too. I just wish it wasn't so salty. I just couldn't drink any of the broth because of the sodium content (even though I really wanted to). Nonetheless, it was delicious!  Remember to try their chicken karage. It tastes better than it looks. Comes out hot and juicy. Although fried, it wasn't greasy at all.  The tempura was perfect as well. The batter was perfect and fried just right.   Although the restaurant was small, there was no wait. The dining room and restrooms were really clean. The waiter was excellent as well. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"At 13 cents per package, ramen could theoretically sustain you for 365 straight days at a cost of only $142.35 at three meals a day.    Two packages of ramen exceeds your daily allotment for sodium though so don't do it, okay?  Ah, Ramen Dozo.  What can be said about this place?  Firstly, the portion size is more than generous and the ramen is cooked to an absolute perfect al dente.  The tonkotsu broth, where there are some fat drippings visually there but not felt by the stickiness on the lips, by appearance looks almost legit.  The flavor of the broth is pretty delicate and had a nice hint of garlic but doesn't offer much of that porky taste that is in a good tonkotsu.  The egg was medium boiled but also had great flavor.  With the broth being light on flavor and lacking the gelatinous feel, it needed that rich egg yolk of a perfectly soft boiled egg.  I do love how the cha shu is insanely melt-in-your-mouth. The overall bowl was decent but I wouldn't say it's my favorite bowl of ramen.  The spicy miso was pretty average as well.  If you're thinking about doing a combination with the Poke Tuna Don, I suggest passing.  It was served much too warm and the marinade was overpowering.  Overall, service is great and the place is clean. Seating is also much better here than their sister store Izakaya Dozo.  I would rank this place a 3.5 stars but the perfect cook on the ramen and the flavorful cha shu and egg helps bump them up to a 4.  I would love to try their Happy Hour items!"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen!! And the girl who served us was also very attentive. I am recommending this to my friends and family. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Not too bad place. I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen and it was pretty satisfying. It wasn't the most excellent ramen cause the noodles seemed they were store bought, but it wasn't the worst I ever tasted. Good place for a quick bite to eat and good priced. Although the water did taste unfiltered. Would I go out of my way to come here again, no, But I would if I'm in the area."}

{"text":"Ramen Dozo  Small Restaurant on the South East corner of Southern and McClintock not very visiable from the street.  Another hole in the wall gem in Tempe for Ramen and authentic Japanese food.  We had the Tonkatsu Combination Ramen with Gyozas and the other combination with California Rolls. The ramen dish was $9.50 and with the combination was an additional $4.50. The Tonkatsu Ramen comes with the Pork Bone Broth and is excellent in flavor and consistency which also includes an egg, Cha Sui and Seaweed. One of the better Ramen in town. The Gyozas are also excellent, slightly crispy on one side gives it a great taste when you bite into it. California Roll is smaller in portions but can tell it is fresh. Overall very good experience and prefer this location for ramen over most in Tempe"}
{"text":"This was the okayest ramen. Here's the deal. If you have \"ramen\" in the name of your restaurant, you better have bomb ass ramen. This is really a Japanese restaurant that sells ramen...but it's just not that great. It was salty and lacked that beautiful umami seared pork belly flavor that makes your pupils dilate when you have truly great broth. We had to ask for all the condiments (chili flakes, sesame seeds, etc.), which just seemed odd.  We got a spider roll, stuffed mushrooms and hot tea as well. It came out so late that we figured they forgot to put the order in. The tea never came. Everything was oddly expensive as well. Nothing was horrible, nothing was great. The people were very nice, though."}
