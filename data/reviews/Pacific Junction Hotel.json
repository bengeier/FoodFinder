{"text":"The energy in this place is terrific. The food is terrific (try the Mac & Cheese Poppers). The taps are terrific, great now I want a beer! The staff are amazing! Go. Just Go."}
{"text":"A funky little dive bar in an area that doesn't have a ton of it's kind. Fun staff and a laid back vibe. The menu is on the smaller side so it's better for beers and snacks with some friends, but"}
{"text":"When I first walked into Pacific Junction Hotel, my initial reaction was that this place was trying too hard to be a Queen West place......from the 80s. Then after reading the reviews, I really wasn't expecting much.   Personally, I like it. It's a great place to meet friends before heading out or a place to meet up with friends. The vibe is pretty casual. It has ping pong, pool & pinball on a different level so that it doesn't disrupt the folks sitting at the tables.  I have sampled a few things on the menu like the Poutine Spring Rolls (worth a try at least once) & the Buffalo Tofu. It's not really a place to have dinner, it's a place to share odd food with your friends.    This is my neighbourhood joint and while I realize that there is an affiliation with Betty's, I prefer this place. It doesn't have the old bar flys or lots of students being loud and obnoxious.  **if you are in the neighbourhood, give it a try**"}
{"text":"Fantastic spot!  Go for the beer, stay for the nachos and Big Buck Hunter!  The nachos are amazing and friends and I have dropped our bank accounts on the Buck Hunter game which is so much fun.  The music is usually great (they have an electronic jukebox going some, if not most nights) with all the 90's hits you could ask for.  One night we went in and it was a lot of house music and random hip hop (not that the music is a bad thing, just not what the bar was known for and part of why we like it).  The server apologized, agreed with us, and said it was a special request DJ for a birthday and we were given shots as a peace offering which was a fairly nice gesture we thought!  The only loss of a star is that this place has really picked up in popularity and it gets really crammed in the main bar area.  On weekends when walking in you are instantly hit with a traffic jam and it's really narrow and hard to try and squeeze through to the rest of the bar.    Otherwise, definitey check this place out if not for just a quick beer, nacho break, pool, ping pong, buck hunter, hockey game, whatever!!"}
{"text":"Sigh.  Pacific Hotel Junction seemed like a place I would like.  Quirky and kitschy decor.  Doesn't take itself too seriously.  Within a ten minute walk from my house.  You can sit in a bathtub!  What's not to like?  Answer: a lot  I went to Pacific Hotel Junction on a Friday night around 10:30. The place was pretty busy.  They have an outdoor patio that closes at 11 pm and the inside really filled up after that.  I think they were understaffed and it's a new bar so they are probably working out the kinks... but still.  *      The mojitos tasted like sour mix.  We switched to wine.  It also tasted sour.  We were afraid to send the wine back because the server gave us a lot of pushback when we complained about the mojitos.    *      When you order a rum and coke, you get charged for a rum and for a coke.  (this is not a big deal, but seems odd to me).  *      Service was painfully slow.  At the end of the night after we had waited an eternity for our bill to come, the server apologized and said he had been slammed. Note to our server  - if you are understaffed, tell us at the beginning of the night.  We will feel badly for you.  Don't tell us after we've paid the bill.  We're already grumpy and impatient and we've already tipped you so your apology won't help your bottom line.  *       Also, sitting in a bathtub is not comfortable.  On the plus side, they serve quarts and I do like the laid back atmosphere.  And it's so close to home I might try it again to see if they've improved their service and bartending.  If  I do, I will update this.    Atmosphere: 4/5 Drinks 2/5 Service 2/5"}
{"text":"This place has no idea what it wants to be. Is it Mexican? Or Cajun? It reminds me of a trailer park in South Florida. Which could be cool, but this place has too much going on. The food is not very delicious. And the pints aren't full pints. Not to mention the music. Staff kept putting money in the jukebox and playing things like Taylor Swift and other junk like that. This neighborhood is desperate for a cool place to hang out that is actually cool."}
{"text":"just hit this place once, but prolly gonna go back, they have tequila offers or promo, clean space, a bit crowded, with lots of games to play, with patio, good music, and good staff..."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now, first time a lot more enjoyable although nothing special, and after my experience the second time I wont be going back, even though its only just across the road from my house, so very convenient.  Very diverse range of choices on the menu, although nothing especially stands out. We tried various tacos, the fish burger,  normal burger, sweet potato fries, edamame, and artichoke dip. Food was only ok, lacks that something special.    Service was terrible, the artichoke dip didnt even come out until 15 minutes after we had finished eating the rest of our meal, and there was not even a sorry. Only time the waitress even tried to be nice or smile was when she bought us the cash machine to pay our bill and she said sorry that she was really busy tonight.  Really the place is half empty???  Go for drinks only and save your money to get a decent meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"3/5! Great place for birthdays or group gatherings! I recommend the sliders and pouting spring rolls! I am not a huge fan of pub food- but if that is your thing- definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Came here for a snack recently, and just to check the place out since it's around the corner from me. The place has a student pub vibe (and the associated beer-soaked smell), with a few games out for patrons to play.  We shared the chimmichurri beef. You'd have to order it to truly understand how we felt when the beef skewers were set down on our table. The meat was tender and delicious, and I'd definitely recommend the dish. I'm not a drinker so I can't comment much on the drinks menu."}
{"text":"Just opened- don't be fooled by the word \"hotel\" in the name. This place is a very cool new restaurant on King east of Sherbourne. 2oz drinks and an amazing menu (all foods you eat with your hands). Just finished a cajun catfish po'boy sammy with homemade chips and salsa - and boozy margarita!! The energy of the place is relaxed but still hip. I'll definitely be back for drinks and more food - maybe try the poutine spring rolls next time!"}
{"text":"The place is really nice and the staff are super super friendly. Ping pong tables and pool tables are available on the upper level. There is a patio that I have not tested yet but everyone seems to love the patio. The bar counters are also used as  chalkboards with chalks available on the bar. Good variety of draft beers and very tasteful music. The place is a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"This place was aight, but the waitress was so bad I don't think I'll voluntarily come back. She literally just forgot to punch in two of my friends' orders, and then got mine wrong. She wasn't very nice either. The jerk chicken tacos were great, but the edamame tasted like it was straight from the microwave. No seasoning at all. Fun spot to play some games on the top floor when it's not packed (if it is, expect a weird first year dorm party vibe.)  I would not recommend this place for a group dinner of any kind."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, mason jar pints, decent bottled beer selection. Music was a bit too loud for conversation at times."}
{"text":"Super cool spot, amazing fish tacos, and cheap drinks! The staff are really friendly; couldn't ask for a better neighbourhood joint!"}
{"text":"I had always heard good things about Pacific Junction Hotel, and so when some co-workers proposed it as a lunch option I jumped at the chance.  I think one thing that hurt the rating for me was that it seems like PJH is more of an experience than an eating establishment and during lunch you really miss out on the experience (and I have gone twice now so it wasn't a one and done situation).    Before I had gone, I had heard so much about the po'boy (it was listed in the top 10 in the city at the end of 2014) but was disappointed to see it was taken off the menu.  Also, both times several of the items on the menu were unavailable.  The menu basically went from 12 options to about 7 or 8 options.  The other knock on this place is that really salads are not an option either because they do not have real cutlery, if you order a salad you have to use the wooden chip truck forks which is near impossible.  Price is average and the decor is hipster chic so nothing is sparkling.  The food was alright, nothing to write home about but you felt satisfied when you were finished.  I would not go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"I can't believe the reviews for this neighbourhood gem are so low! Reasonable, fair prices for outstanding food and atmosphere. Fell in love with this place at our last business lunch. I LOVE the decor and vibe. And our waitress was super nice."}
{"text":"Really kitch, eclectic decor and a steadfast 'cutlery-free' mentality - this place is good for drinks and snacks with friends or a late night hang out.   There are vegetarian options including the buffalo tofu (breaded) and veggie burgers. Their burgers and sandwiches all come with a lettuce wrap option for the gluten-free folks out there.   It's not pricey but I'd say it's more expensive than it should be for what you get."}
{"text":"The place has a great vibe. The food is good and nice drink selection. I prefer when they have a DJ there but other then that I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for after-work drinks and snacks on a Friday. Was only 1/2 full, the waitress indicated the place normally fills up as it gets later. Nice back patio, great service. Their Ass Lager was easy-drinking, and a cheap pitcher! We only tried the appetizer platter, but what great drunk/drinking food! The poutine springroll, which sounded bizarre, was great! Stuffed with fries and cheese, you dip it in delicious house-made gravy. Everything else was tasty as well, poppers and meat skewers, but the springroll was the high point because, really .. it should have been gimmicky gross, but wasn't. Looking forward to heading back again!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place but it's not how it was before. I was here on couple occasions last year and was always happy with the food(their burger was great and mmmm the fish tacos). Not sure when did the menu change to pizza and dumplings. Me and my friend got fish tacos. One taco is 4.50$ does not even come in tortilla just lettuce instead. Fish is tasteless and falling apart (wet bleh). Not sure about dumplings but avoid those overpriced tacos. The waitress seemed not really interested in us after she realized we won't order any more drinks. After that we felt like we were rushed to leave. The place wasnt even busy so I don't know why would they want us to leave. Also feels weird seeing staff just sitting on their laptop going over swimsuits to order lol  Used to really like this place i feel now its not worth it. There are way better places to go to"}
{"text":"Edit: added the edit and changed review from 1 star to 3!  tldr; had delicious food at a Christmas party, then came back two weeks later and waited 45 minutes to receive a voucher instead of food.   May have to edit my review later, I'm just hungry and angry right now.  My mister and I came here for a Christmas party recently, and liked the food so we thought we'd come back for lunch. Big mistake.   Ordered a pizza, waited 45 minutes only to be told the pizza oven was on the fritz. We were given a 'coupon' to redeem a pizza for free some other time when it was working. While we waited, we watched enviously as the two patrons before us finished their pizzas, and the patron that came 10 minutes after us completed their meal.   The pizza is made next door at Betsy's. Now that I know I will go there first so they can tell us sooner than 45 minutes of waiting if their equipment goes down. Our server was apologetic for our wait, which we appreciated, but apologies could not sate the roiling, angry hunger we had built up.   It took up almost our whole lunch hour and I ended up going down the road to get a sandwich in the spare 10 minutes I had for lunch. Now I'm hungry and frustrated and I have to rush back to work to eat my take out from Timmies, maybe work longer to make up the extra time, and maybe come back to edit this review when I'm not hangry and freshly frustrated with the wait.  edit: Whew, I finished my lunch (from Timmies) and feel less frustrated. Changing my review from 1 star to 3 for now! Reasons for upping the rating: When my company had their Christmas party here, the feeling upstairs was pretty unique. Interesting furniture and space, the servers were quite nice to us, despite the fact we completely crowded their upper floor and had some rowdy co-workers. The food was tasty, I had a tasty pop and some pizza+onion rings, I didn't have any complaints.   The pizza was really good at the Christmas party.  I'm hoping I can return some other time for delicious pizza! For now, here is a 3 star review to split the difference between the fun party the first time and the awfully long wait the second time we were there."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!!  The cocktails are unique and refreshing, the staff are always attentive and friendly, the food is as unique as the decorations adorning the venue. The menu and eclectic decorations are random and cheeky to encourage you to have a good time. They have also have a rather large game room in the back of the place with a pool table, an arcade system  and ping pong table.  It's a perfect place to have a party."}
{"text":"Glorified hole in the wall. Very pretentious and cliquey to say the least, most patrons I spoke to that were attending for their first time did not suggest returning rather going some where else. Did not try the food, only drank, was insulted when the hostess found out I was attending alone and had a light hearted sense of humour. Take a healthy walk instead"}
{"text":"Amazing! Came by one evening, and was definitely more than happy with what they had to offer.   First off, they had certain beers and drinks that other places didn't. The radler they had was amazing and definitely a drink I'd go back for!  The food was all unique and absolutely delicious. We shared the platter, which had all different starters. All were amazing and definitely recommend that so you can try everything.  I had the Alligator Tacos, and they were phenomenal! Very good balance of flavour as well!  The service was quick, friendly, and they were easy to talk to as well. Gave excellent recommendations when asked about the menu!  Highly recommend this spot, and will be back myself!"}
{"text":"The name kinda implies its a fancy hotel bar. well its NOT. its just a very casual place with a cool back patio. Which would have normally been fine, but its right besides Betty's and it looks EXACTLY like Betty's. So WHY? I mean I would stay a loyal customer to Betty's now unless its packed there which hasn't really happened to me even once.   I guess the food makes a difference then as this place has a Mexican theme food whereas Betty's serves mostly home made pub food. I had a tequila Caesar there which was pretty good, food wasn't anything WOW special especially with all these new Mexican places opening in the city.  And the side guacamole was like the size of a toonie.   Overall I like the casual atmosphere and even that the food isn't so great its just a chill hangout place. But so is Betty's!"}
{"text":"This place is great for making reservations for parties. They were very helpful over email. A word of caution, the Margarita bowls are quite strong. Unfortunately some people in my party had a bit too much - but luckily the bartenders and security were very helpful and understanding. They behaved very professionally and weren't rude at all. It seems like they really care about the wellbeing of their customers. Kudos for putting up with the insanity we put you through."}
{"text":"Quirky doesn't even begin to describe this place. The decor looks like something Hunter S. Thompson would dream off while on peyote.  The drinks are phenomenal and they come on regular glasses or bowls, which are perfect for sharing. Don't bother with their draught list, there's nothing out of the ordinary available.  Staff is nice and helpful and there's plenty to do if you're not into talking to your fellow bar goers like pool, pinball, ping pong and a 2-storey long beer funnel. That should get the conversation going at least."}
{"text":"The PJH is a really cool concept, A FUNKY, read hipster haunt with fantastic music and a definite Island feel.  The space is utilized beautifully, with large communal spaces, but also separate booths which are perfect for small groups.  The upstairs features Ping Pong and Pool tables, with a number of mounted flat screen TV's. This space tends to fill up quickly right after work, so it is recommended that you get there straight off.  I really wish I could give the PJH another star, or even two, because the service was really attentive and the atmosphere can't be beat, BUT the food was downright awful.  We ordered a grilled cheese that was basically processed cheese slapped between two pieces of bread-but it actually wasn't even cooked, so the cheese literally fell out of the sandwich, if you can call it that.  The accompanying tomato basil soup was more of a pasta sauce, thick and chunky, and it may have been great on pasta, but definitely not what one expects when ordering a side soup.  I hate to beat a dead Horse, but we also ordered Jerk Chicken Tacos and they were actually cold.  Again the concept was good, but the execution wasn't up to snuff.  I'd definitely go here again for drinks, but think I may venture somewhere else for food.  If they can lock down their food game the PJH will be an absolute winner.  Here's hoping."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places so far. Starting from its rustic sort of hipster decoration, to the good music and wonderful service this place has to offer. Prices are really affordable for those trying to save some money. It's got ping pong tables on the second floor.  My recommendation:  - Mulepower lager... $5.50 - artichoke dip - might be the best spinach artichoke dip you've ever had, served hot with rainbow tortilla chips $8.75"}
{"text":"I went here for a work function, we were saying goodbye to a coworker from my department and despite looking things up the day before, I couldn't get myself really excited about the menu. This theme would continue.  The bar is completely not capable of making a mixed drink not on the menu, despite having the ingredients in front of you. They don't offer any hot beverages like coffee or tea. They are very dedicated to their Mexican theme even at lunch during a chilly winter day. The waitress seemed a bit upset that I kept asking questions even, she kept referring to the decor as if that explained why I couldn't have tea. Well, sure, ok.  Despite this bizarre introduction, the food was pleasantly surprising. I did very much enjoy the conch fritters, I'd never had something like that before and they were quite filling with a great cocktail sauce dip. Also? $7.50.  A STEAL of a price! Another person at our table had the Bison sliders and they looked totally adorable and had a nice variety of flavours, the artichoke dip was actually almost as good as advertised and the crab cakes were tasty. But by all means, avoid the poutine spring rolls, they are just dreadfully boring.   All in all, the experience was average. If I was coming to dinner or for drinks instead, it might be different, but the atmosphere felt forced and a bit silly. Also, my suggestion would to be to add some Mexican hot chocolate or something so people can warm up five months of the year without ruining the \"theme\"."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time.  The ambience is very casual and the decor eclectic. Great music selection   The floor plan of this place is a bit bizzare  but it kinda works that there's many little nooks and crannies where your group can have a more intimate space.  There's a ping pong table, Foosball table, air hokey and pool so lots of things to do.  There are also an old fashion game machine.  They have a wide selection  of cocktails and comfort food.  I really apologize for not having the food pix as we were too hungry by the time I remembered the food was gone.   We had ginger chicken, which was nice and crunchy. There is a little bit of spice to it but not too overwhelming. The buttermilk fried chicken was flavourful but a bit on the greasy side. I had to leave the skin (with a lot of internal struggle). We also had the Mac and cheese puffer, not my favourite but everyone else loved it.   They also have a variety of pizza which they order from next door made by Betty's  (same owner). One of them is called the potluck pizza, which is basically a surprise pizza. It's only 7.99 for anyone who is adventurous. My friend ordered it and found out that one of the toppings is cricket  (yes it's on the menu). While we agree that crickets can taste very nice, it was too much of a mental image for her so we asked the waitress to swap...they apologized profusely, as they also never know what surprises the kitchen will throw on there.   The staff here are attentive and friendly. Without asking they can do individual billing and remember what everyone order which ha pretty good when we had a big group with everyone arriving throughout the evening.  I will definitely come back again  Note: they don't have cutlery here so be prepared to eat with your hands and play with your food!"}
{"text":"The food is terrible and thIs place deserves a health inspection. We were all really sick after eating here. Shame as nice bar and good location."}
{"text":"- overpriced, and not a lot on the plate- meh tasting.  - meh service - the interior is really cool, I really enjoyed the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great service, chill place , great food ..what more could you ask for! The cocktails are all great...best food items would be the pizzas, poutine spring rolls and tacos. try out the alligator meat if you are so daring :)"}
{"text":"Hipster heaven.  Feels like the Ossington strip here.   I like it because it has table tennis, pool tables, sit down pac-man, pinball tables and foosball.  It's great for private parties - they have a few tables / rooms at the back suitable for groups up to 10-12.  I didn't try the food but my friends tell me it's all very good.    Drinks are served in mason jars.     Overall, a fun place."}
{"text":"Very eclectic decor. PJH looks like a great hotspot for the summer. Too bad I came to visit during the middle of winter. I like how the menu is not generic - they have standouts such as poutine springroll and crispy buffalo tofu. I decided to go for their famous poutine spring rolls. What I love about the poutine spring rolls was the creativity of it - it's shareable, it's a fusion between two well loved classics, and it has great presentation! The only thing I would improve upon it would be to add spring onions to give it more flavour."}
{"text":"Great place for large groups and the servers are all pleasant and present (unlike Betty's next door) This place has a great array of mexican food! Some of the best nachos I've ever had (recommendations: cafeteria tray nachos with roasted beans and (for sharing) a bowl of lime margarita) This place also has games/activities on the top floor like pool and ping pong!"}
{"text":"The best bar EVER ... on a Monday. I met three of my friends here for drinks on a Monday night. This place was on my radar since walking by it, but it completely surpassed my expectations.  The air hockey table had ICE on it. And you use mini sticks. It's so freaking fun. They've got ping pong, pool ($2), a hunting game that I couldn't figure out for the life of me, split level seating (it made the space feel much more intimate), and a live band. I would say this would be a BOMB spot for a date. Pitchers of beer, fun games. Great vibe. I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Victoria, the bartender, was amazing! She was funny, efficient, perfectly dry and witty AND she gave us sour candies just 'cuz. LOVE IT! The nachos were yum and the salsa delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last night. It's a kitschy restaurant decorated with a tropical inspiration on the east side of the Financial District. The menu has at least 4 pages of tropical drinks. I ordered the Harry Nilson - a rum concoction of spiced rum, coconut water and a dash of lime. It was quite yummy.   We all happened to order the jerk chicken - which was shredded chicken in thick jerk sauce wrapped in a soft corn tortilla. The dish came with 3 of thees tortilla wraps and a small serving of crispy chips. I liked it. It hit the spot.   This is an ideal restaurant for a late cocktail visit."}
{"text":"This place is honestly such a gem. A cute little eatery on King East with an eclectic vibe and super tasty food. Their menu is a mix of comfort classics and fun shareables, making for a great lunch spot with friends. Having been sick with the flu for the past week, I was really glad just to be eating real food again - a satisfying first meal back!  I got the tomato basil soup w/ grilled cheese and my boyfriend opted for the PJH sampler (which includes 1 poutine springroll, 2 mac poppers, 2 crispy tofu, and 2 skewers). There's a review from a little while ago that details a very poor experience with the tomato soup and grilled cheese, but I am happy to say that this is no longer true and they have indeed stepped up their food game; the soup was a perfect consistency and the grilled cheese did not taste processed at all. The sampler is a great way to try a bunch of their cool shareables without ordering half the menu and totally worth it if you love variety. Of the items included, I tried their famous poutine springroll and a mac popper. Both had me surprised at how uniquely flavourful they were despite being smothered in deep fried goodness - springroll was a definite favourite and a must-try in my books!  Service here can be a little slow (especially when they're first starting up for the day) but the waitress was friendly and quick in letting me pay the bill/grab a take-out container, which I really appreciated as we were in a bit of a rush. Overall, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Okay to start off, my rating would probably be 2 stars, but their AMAZING poutine spring rolls push them over a star - a must try. However, it's all downhill from there. We were there for a birthday party, had the upstairs to ourselves for the beginning of the night and then another huge group came up and it got really crowded.   I found this place rather shady. We all had tabs open, and as the place started to get more crowded we decided to close them because we were nervous that our tabs would get mixed up.  When we went to xlose our tabs, a couple guys we were with had extra beer orders on theirs, which was cleared up and it was fine. The bar was what was really shady! My drink order at the bar came to $19.75, I gave the guy a $50 bill and he gives me $20.75 back. The bartender probably thought I was too tipsy to count my change. He gave me three $5s and the rest in coins. When I clarified the drink order amount and told him he didn't give me enough change, he counted one of my 5's as a $20 and told me it was correct, at which point I was more than annoyed and told him that I knew it was a $5 and he gave me the correct change. What was even more odd was that one of the guys we were with went to the bar and wanted to pay cash for his beer but they said he needed a credit card to pay, literally 5 minutes after I paid in cash. Made absolutely no sense! It's not a bad spot, but be very aware of your money while you're there."}
{"text":"This place is super weird and eclectic, which is really where it gains points for me. The decor upstairs felt like it was all purchased at a Mexican garage sale (in a strange-but-good way). The menu is fairly large but doesn't have all that many appealing options, in my opinion. I ordered some kind of chicken taco, which I enjoyed. The service was quite slow, though, and their portable interac machine apparently doesn't have a strong enough signal to reach the tables upstairs, which the server explained while she awkwardly hung out and waited for several minutes while the machine thought about maybe processing the payment (we ended up just paying downstairs).  I really don't think I'd be back for food because I didn't feel like the price point and service quality made it worthwhile, but I'd probably stop in for a drink at their bar some time."}
{"text":"This place deserves an freaking award. I reserved one of the rooms for a 30th birthday and the staff did an amazing job accommodating a huge cake and huge balloons on a busy Saturday night.   Reservations through email went smoothly and they answered all my annoying questions. Kudos to them.   What really made me write this review was our hostess- I didn't grab her name and I really wish I did. She did an amazing job organizing all 15 of our separate orders for separate checks, helping me with the cake, etc. And she always checked up on us when they were crazy busy.   The staff here is really helpful and the atmosphere is different and fun. I didn't really like the tacos but the ginger chicken appetizer is delicious. The drinks are regularly priced and they have a huge selection of cocktails and draft beers. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, usually with a pretty big work group and every time they try and rip us off by adding stuff to the bill and saying someone left without paying which we're sure isn't true. It's happened too many times to be an accident. I was there last night for a couple and went to pay my bill. The server shortchanged me and when I questioned it and said she was having 'one of those nights'. I don't usually write reviews but this is pretty bad and must happen a lot. So, cool bar, sketchy staff."}
{"text":"Was here last night for the first time in ages. It's one of the neighbourhood bars in King East and typically has a relaxing cool vibe. Last night was super busy! My friends had the upstairs booked for their birthdays and they ordered a bunch of apps. It was okay, I enjoyed the wings and poutine spring rolls. What I didn't like was giving them my credit card to start a tab. But I know that's pretty common in most bars for a large group.   What I was nervous about and referenced in another review below, everyone's bills were messed up with extra beers on the bill but not actually getting the drink. That's the only issues we had last night. Otherwise, this place is ok to grab a drink."}
{"text":"I had fun here but it had mostly to do with the people I met on my birthday. Such great personalities and everyone bought me shots. This is totally a hipster bar and I like it. Very small but is very good on Wednesdays! I will come back here again to get Grolsch and meet some more wonderful people!"}
{"text":"It's a super chilled out bar on King East.  It has a really quaint and cool back patio.  It's a great place for dinner and drinks or just drinks with friends, very laid back atmosphere.  I had the fish tacos and they were delicious.  I recommend this place if you are looking for chilled out place with great service, good food and drinks."}
{"text":"Come here for a drink, and you won't be disappointed. The ginger bourbon sour stands out. But food wise, this place falls terribly short. The menu is island influenced, but doesn't taste like there's actually someone from the island executing. The portions are small, the food tastes cheap, and nothing stands out. It's just different pub food at the end of the day, and falls into that category. There are pubs that take pride in their food all the same, and elevate it like Ceili's Cottage - but Pacific Junction just seems to have this menu for the sake of having a menu."}
{"text":"This is more a review for the food than the drinks. Drinks were 3.5 to 4 stars.   VIBE  Housed in the old Veritas restaurant (where the Veritas sign still hangs) and right beside Betty's is the Pacific Junction Hotel. I find it a very odd name for its location and a tad bit misleading, but maybe that's what they're going for? I don't know. Menus are housed in recycled old magazines which is creative but potentially confusing, especially if the pages stick together!    I really like the vibe here and the patio looks fantastic. Closed off but colourful.  I was able to sit in a reconverted bathtub with all of the cushions. Fun stuff!  They've got hula hoops and leis hanging about to give it the \"hipster, laid back, cool vibe\" or whatever the youth of today are doing. I do really like the vibe here and think it's more for drinks after work than it is for dining in. Speaking of...  WE ATE/DRANK  Let's start with drinks: pretty good mojitos housed in mason jars. It's easy to have two especially when deep in conversation. They go down smooth. Dining companion's margarita was a bit salty. I was hoping to have the Coronita Margarita but at \"Market Price\" for $14, I felt it was too much to pay. Our server was generous and gave us two complimentary shots which I feel was a nice touch.   The food wasn't good. I'm sorry. I wanted to like it but I wasn't feeling it.  From pictures, I noticed a lot of the food was fried. I had good hopes for the baja fish tacos for but for three tacos with some fried fish in it and maybe a dropping of lettuce at $14 when Grand Electric is selling some of the best tacos north of this border for $3.50 each? It's a rip off. And not filling! No flavour.   The jalapeno poppers wrapped in bacon were actually pretty good. I liked those. You can't go wrong with bacon.   We were curious about the unique sounding poutine spring rolls --they're exactly what they sound like--- and if you like fried, go for it. But I didn't feel that they were hot enough or gooey enough. Just an addition to my waistline. The gravy is akin to that of KFC.   I know, I'm harsh but if I'm spending upwards to $14 for appetizers or tapas, it should be good. And I didn't feel like this was.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Go for drinks, absolutely and for the fun atmosphere and hidden back patio. But food? Nope."}
{"text":"Nice little hidden place that I don't think is an actual hotel but that doesn't really matter. This is the place to go to get your corona on. As is cliche with Corona Renee bars, there's lots of beach theme in the decor. On today's menu we have: Surfboards! Bamboo! Clashing of blue with red and orange! A pineapple corer and juicer stuck to the wall!  Margaritas! Hipster waitresses! Limes! Umm, beach stuff?  Wait, what? The only thing that's not beached themed are the waitresses. Not that it really makes a difference, as they are sufficiently courteous and unaffected.   The food is pretty good actually, and the upside down beer margarita will guarantee someone will ask \" what's that mannnnn?\" - I did that. Totes.   Check it out, don't tweet about it.  Hang 10. Party on, or something."}
{"text":"Service here was really awesome! We had the pleasure of meeting a bartenders mom and they made us feel like family. The beef tacos are good. The Curry Ketchup is to die for!! The nachos are HUGE! We ordered the 1/2 tacos and there were still big. The Putin Spring rolls are amazing. In all this place is a MUST!"}
{"text":"Such a cute and quirky place! I liked the decor, the layout and the games they have inside the bar. I didn't try the food but the drinks were good and the people were really friendly. I especially liked the table top arcade and the table tennis. They have really areas for medium sized groups and the free wifi is a plus."}
{"text":"Decor and vibe was really unique. Garage sale tables and bathtub seating were definitely fun and quirky eye catchers. But the overall uniqueness of the place became a bit too much too fast.   The menu, the actual menu, was glued onto pages of a magazine. It was hard to follow, and some of the pages stuck together.   Drinks: Beer on tap weren't poured into full pints (into little jam jars or something). At least we didn't seem to think so. If anyone else can confirm, would be great as we (me) probably won't return. Myself and my girlfriend ordered beer, but the rest of our party tried the other stuff. Margaritas were great and boozy. The mojitos were just as boozy and really sour, which I myself preferred actually. The margarita coronas were fun. You got a margarita served in a jar, then a mini corona bottle which you stuck upside down right into your drink. Very boozy and quite fun, but would have helped if the waitress showed us how to set it up. One of our friends wasted half the drink trying to put the two together.   Food wasn't the greatest. We had the fish tacos. Save yourself the $14. You get three tiny tacos which consisted of fried soft tortilla and fried fish. Salsa, lettuce and sour cream on the side. Nothing stood out and nothing stuck to memory, other than it was a waste of $14. Would have loved to try the guacamole, but waitress forgot our order.   Service overall was pretty slow as well, but we'll credit that to the place being new and there was only one waitress serving the whole place at the time. Poor thing could've used some help.   Overall, it got too crowded too fast as the decor was way too busy, and the food didn't really keep us in. The drinks would have, if we were paid a little more attention so we could order more.   Maybe this place will improve? Who knows. But for a first time visit, not so impressive."}
{"text":"My 5 friends and I went here on a Saturday night. Great atmosphere. Lots of nooks to sit in with your friends or stand/ sit along the bar. The drinks were quality and not crazy prices. I got the Trap Queen which was a gin with fruit and mint. My friends and I played foosball for most of the time and had a blast. Music was on point: mix of 2000s hits. Highly recommend for a group of friends trying to hang out with each other in a fun place. No cover."}
{"text":"Love this place.   First stumbled upon it when Betty's was too busy.  Happy I did.   The thing that stands out most to me is that each time I have went (3x now), the service has been incredible.  I have had a different server each time I went, and they have always been unbelievably friendly and great at their jobs.   I will admit that every time i have been there, I have been under the glow of a beverage or two - but even so the poutine spring rolls are a must try!"}
{"text":"Just came here for a drink. The margaritas and dark and stormys are excellent and drawing on the bar with chalk is super fun!"}
{"text":"I'm a loyal Betty's fan, but I've been to the Hotel a few times now and it's winning me over.  Food is better and more interesting than most comparable bars (and definitely superior to most bars that have a rowdy and fun atmosphere like this one), drinks are good and the mescal selection in addition to the tequila is nice. Ping pong and pool is great, and the music selection is consistently fun. I was a big fan of the service the couple times I ate (including free shots because one of the staff had to reach behind us to change the AC).  Protip: the patio closes at 11 (due to either regulation or consideration for neighbors), so go a bit earlier if you want to hang there for awhile."}
