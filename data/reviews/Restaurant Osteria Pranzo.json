{"text":"Take an Italian nonna's (Grandmother) home recipes and give them to an experienced and creative chef to add his refined touch and this is what to expect at Osteria Pranzo. An avant-garde and trendy take on traditional Italian dishes; with never a shortage of exquisit taste and welcoming service. This is a restaurant that once you go, will have you returning to savour all the other dishes! 

The staff is incredibly welcoming and pay very close attention to your dining needs (probably due to the fact that it is a very quaint restaurant and they are never short staffed). Menu options are not many but you can be sure that what you chose will be fresh. If there is nothing on the menu that tickles your taste buds, just ask the waiter and they will give you off-menu options as well.

The focus at this place is taste! Everything is perfectly seasoned and each food combination is carefully prepared to give you a wonderful culinery experience. From the litte amuse-bouche at the beginning of the meal (mini-meatballs), to the fruit platter at the end, everything is there to reel you in again...and you will be back...you can bet on it!!"}
{"text":"Visited this place before a boxing match and had a ceaser salad as well as the fantastic and tasty ravioli. Atmosphere is very cozy. Service was fast and friendly. All dishes exceeded expectations and had delicious flavour. Have visited twice and everything I have ordered never fails to hit it out of the park! We will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"This place is a true gem tucked away in Saint Michel.  When you arrive you start off with meatballs and giardiniera (vegetables pickled in vinegar) as well as grilled bread which is delicious.   All of these appetizers are very good!  You can also order antipasti if you like.  

The menu is small as they choose to focus on doing a few items very well.  It changes on what I'm pretty sure is a weekly basis.  Usually they have a few meat dishes, a pasta dish or 2 and 1 or 2 seafood dishes.   I've tried a bunch of different dishes and have never been disappointed.  They do rabbit really well and I highly recommend it.  I've also had a seafood risotto which was really tasty too.

For dessert I highly recommend the budino which is a chocolate pudding of sorts.  It comes to the table piping hot and is very delicious.  They also bring a fruit or nut plate to finish off the night.  

Reservations are an absolute must for this place.   The dining room is small and the place is always full  I highly recommend this restaurant.  I always enjoy myself when I go."}
