{"text":"I love Coop's! It's one of my go-to places for a dinner downtown with friends. 

They have a great beer selection, and the waitstaff is happy to bring you a sample of anything you've not had before.

As simple as it is, I love their grilled cheese and harvest (tomato and red pepper) soup in the cooler months. Thick, crusty bread with a few different cheeses and hot soup to dip in-- perfect comfort food. 

When opting to go a little healthier, I love their sweet corn Caesar salad. It's flavorful, with green onions and red and poblano peppers on top, along with sweet kernels of fresh corn. In the past, when I've added chicken, there was one time that it was over-salted, but I've ordered it at least a dozen times, so I forgave it as a fluke.

Everything else has been wonderful too, they have a delicious selection of sandwiches, and their dinner entrees have been great too. 

Seating can get cozy when they're busy, but it's never bugged me. And if you have a group of 5-8 people, see if you can get the snug! It's a really interesting and fun dining experience, as long as you're ok with sitting on benches."}
{"text":"Cooper's is very hip, with a great beer selection and gastronomic food.  Well, let's qualify the food statement...I had the Mac and cheese with pork belly, which sounded phenomenal on paper, but in actuality was a bit disappointing.  The pork belly--it sounded wrong to begin with, but I thought \"OK it could be brilliant\"--was really at odds with the mac.  AND my mac'n'cheese is way better.  BUT, that being said...Coop's is a way-cool place to hang out.

{"text":"We were coming out of the Capitol and the California family wanted a warm lunch and couldn't handle the wish degree temperature...  Was a little worried about about taking the first and closest place, but were we surprised, so surprised!  Cheese curd and bone marrow appetizers were awesome and a great souvenir for our trip.  The kids loved the Cheese Burgers and quiche and the sweet potatoes chili was great, even after having multiple chili versions over the past few weeks..  My wife's caeser salad was also real good..  Great place, I enjoyed the beer.  All around fun time for the family, thanks!"}
{"text":"Good beer, BUT bad, bad food. Had horrible poutine - which is sad considering that Wisconsin cheese curds should have been the bomb but instead were rubbery and tasteless. Tomato red pepper soup was inedible, salads were anemic. Everything else was microwaved and/or canned. Bills itself as a gastropub, but instead gave me gastroenteritis..."}
{"text":"I think Cooper's is one of the best additions to the Square. They have an excellent beer selection, friendly and informed staff, and a menu that can make anyone happy. 

I like to go to Cooper's for HH, especially in the summer, and sit outside. It's one of the best spots in the city. In the winter, especially when it is snowing, you can't go wrong by sitting at one of the large round table in the front. It is such a perfect winter scene. 

My one complaint about this place is that it can get so unbelievably loud when it is packed and it is impossible to hear. It would be nice if they could do something about that."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch on a glorious Sunday morning and sat outside (no wait, even though it was Ride the Drive and the tail end of Walkerville) . It was just what I needed to eat off my hangover. Our waitress was sweet, quick and efficient. My water was always full -- perfect. I got the asparagus/ some-kind-of-good-cheese quiche, which came with a tasty arugula salad. Nice and fluffy, every bit delicious. 

Love this place."}
{"text":"I have contemplated whether to write this.  It has gnawed at me.  Ten days ago we ate at the tavern.  Sitting outside. Beautiful setting. Very nice. As tables turned over, the tables were cleaned. At one table, the cloth used to wipe the tables was dropped on the ground.  Seminal moment. Rather than immediately replace the cloth, the cloth was picked up and put back on the table and the wiping continued.  I immediately remove my hands from the table and didn't want to touch anything.   

What hope does one have that kitchen staff are trained any better?

Foundation of any food establishment is proper cleanness training.  So sad as the the food tasted good. Yikes!"}
{"text":"Dear Cooper, I had higher hopes for you after viewing your menu online. I had higher hopes for you after walking into your space, obviously channeling what you thought was a gastropub but turned out to be just another pub with flavorless food. Why, Madison, why are you so afraid of flavor?! 

Is that why the Jameson I ordered was so huge? (Thank you!) Is that why your beer list is so extensive and diverse? (Thank you again.) Because you expect your patrons to get well elixed before the food arrives? Let me tell you, the flavors of the food does NOT hold up to the flavors of your drinks. 

I suppose I should have known not to order a Italian dish (polenta) off of a mostly Irish menu. It was not only bland, it was very hot. But not out of the pan hot, out from under the heat lamp / out of the microwave hot. I see you Cooper's, and it ain't nearly as hot as your food. My friend had the mac and cheese with pork belly on top. The mac and cheese, aside from the topper, was dull. So so dull. Not even as flavorfull as Annie's out of the box. Find the salt, it's on a shelf, about head high. And oh my lord this pork belly was awful tasting, when it wasn't chewy and tasteless. Neither dish was 1/2 finished when we were finished. 

Drinks, people. This place is good for drinks and atmosphere and frites."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place on the square for drinks. They have an amazing beer selection and the waitstaff and bartenders are always really personable. I usually go with my boyfriend, and if we get food, we usually split something, as the entrees are a little pricier. 

We like to be adventurous so a few months back we ordered the bone marrow. It was my first time eating it and it was the first time I've ever ordered something I couldn't eat. It is served in the bone and for some reason, that made it unpalatable to me. It doesn't affect my rating, though, as every other dish we have tried has been excellent. 

The only major gripe I have is that they don't take reservations. I get that they are on the square and will fill up quickly without reservations, but there have been many times I've had to go elsewhere because the wait is 2 hours+. I would love to take friends there when they visit us in Madison, but the wait is just too long. 

We usually end up going on weekdays to get our beers. Overall, awesome place with a few minor pitfalls. They don't keep us from returning, though."}
{"text":"Not there yet...

Its negatives is that its pricey and the menu isn't exactly healthy

A great place to go for an indulgence. Very much European style and modern."}
{"text":"One of the best pub food places around. Since it is so good, it is naturally very busy, I avoid the peak hours to skip the wait.

I don't usually dine in pubs, but my friend recommended this place and since then I found myself bringing other friends along again. I tried their coopers burger, the combination of beef, pork belly and cheddar is really creative and gives it a nice finish. The beef is soft and juicy to bite into, perfect for a burger. Their home made chips are also another highlight not to be missed. 

If you are craving a lot of meat, the pork schnitzel comes with a hhuuuuugggeeee slab of loin, nicely fried till crispy yet tender on the inside. The pork belly mac is also a creative combination -- mac and cheese with pork belly. I have never seen it anywhere else. 

Appetizer wise, I tried the poutine and sconnie egg. The servings are huge and definitely worth a share at the table. I always ended up half full from the appetizers alone and had to pack half the main course to go. Great dining deal with great food =)"}
{"text":"I've been to the Cooper's Tavern 3-4 times, and my best experiences have been at brunch or lunch on weekends. 

First of all, yes, the poutine is amazing. How could it not be? On my most recent brunch trip, my friend was feeling torn between getting eggs benedict or poutine, until I pointed out that not ONLY is there something magical called a Poutine Benedict (think poutine with poached eggs and hollandaise), it's only $6! What a steal. And it's as great as you want it to be. My friend wisely asked for a side of gravy with hers, which I did not think to. We shared it the gravy with our respective poutine benedicts -- highly recommend the side of gravy, as there wasn't enough hollandaise to dip fries in. Also the gravy is just delicious.

The tap list is always impressive, but the bloody mary I got failed to meet my expectations. It might have been strong, but it was watery and nearly flavorless. I don't know how that is even possible in a bloody mary?! Also, our service was pretty terrible. Among other things, I asked for hot sauce and didn't get it until 3/4 through the meal, after asking yet again. Our water glasses were also empty a lot. 

My dinner experiences are what drag my rating down from 4 to 3 stars. Most recently I ordered the pretzel crusted chicken, which came with butternut squash hash and a mustard cream sauce. The hash was delicious, but the chicken was super dry and hard. What made that worse, was that there was nowhere near enough mustard sauce to salvage the chicken, make it softer or more flavorful. In general, I just wish their menu was a little more extensive.

My advice: go to Coopers for drinks and poutine, or for brunch -- but don't order the bloody mary. Come to think of it, my friend ordered and Irish coffee and wasn't too impressed with that either. I'd stick to beer."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! There is a wonderful selection of beers around the world and a decent selection of spirits for those that are interested. The food is delicious, but the selection of food is mostly just standard American stuff.  The service is always splendid! In the summer there is a really nice patio to sit at :)"}
{"text":"My new favorite bar & grill!  Tasteful decor, great selection of beer, and good mussels & fries.  What more could you ask for?  Staff is very knowledgeable about their inventory, and it's not hard to find a place to sit.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy English Football on the weekend this is your spot. Fun crowd on a Sunday morning watching soccer and drinking beer, not a bad start to a day. We grabbed a booth and order lunch great burger and fantastic beer selection
Fun spot to enjoy downtown"}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had!!!!

I really enjoyed this place the first few times I went, but they clearly take no pride in who they hire. 

We had the most incompetent stupid girl ever serve us. She'd really be better off having Daddy pay for her sorority dues than trying to work as a server. 

This waitress scoffed at us when we ordered 4 waters even though we ended up ordering bloody marys which were terrible at best. 

She then proceeded to ignore us for awhile as we sat there patiently. Then finally approaching us asking if we were ready to order even though she didn't tell us the specials (the staple meals for having brunch there). 

Once we ordered we waited a absurdly long time followed by our Sigma waitress only bringing out 3 of the 4 dishes saying \"oh my gooood were down one\". 

It took 15 minutes if not more for that fourth plate to come while all our meals were getting nice and cold. I could go on about how my corn beef hash was more like a bag of beef jerky but I digress....

If you care about service at all I would highly recommend you do not go here! 

And just think if you do... Then you are supporting these types of horrible servers. 

I hope this helps... At the very least I hope it gives Coopers a bad mark against them."}
{"text":"A small business that offers has a rustic feel. Great, relaxing atmosphere! We had the Steak Frites and fries, and the Brisket Sandwich. Both was absolutely phenomenal. I am a picky eater, and the steak was cooked perfectly medium rare (which I find hard to find)! The service was great and food came out in a timely manner. Our server was a very nice girl who was very knowledgeable of the menu! This place is a must!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Sunday. I'd almost give it 3.5 but it is not quite there yet to give it 4. The food is good but not so good I'd recommend it to others when there are better places around the square (Graze, Merchant, etc). 

The cider on draft was very good and they have a nice selection of beers. The bartender was not overly interested or friendly so that was a partial disappointment.

Our table was right by the door so every time someone walked in I was blasted with cold air. Not sure if anything can be done about it, but it made my dining experience less pleasant. 

We got the beer cheese pretzels. They were very good but the portions were kind of small. I saved the leftover cheese to dip my fries in.

Two of us shared the burger and they did a nice job splitting it. The homemade chips were quite tasty as well.

Overall, it is a good place and a decent choice. I went once a year ago and had their fish and chips (Old Fashiioned had an 1.5 hr wait so we went to Coopers instead). I don't feel you'll get a bad meal there. I just have not have such a stellar experience that I would make it top of my list."}
{"text":"Great energy and really cool menu.

The salads were among the best we've had.   The choice of beers is almost overwhelming and there are also some good wines by the glass.

This restaurant was absolutely packed on a very cold Tuesday night when I worried it may be quiet - it was a very busy / good buzz / high energy - really liked it."}
{"text":"Great beer, great frites, great location, pretty cool environment...but for vegetarian with few options, what is up with the boring grilled cheese? Went back and ordered without the provolone and extra (supposedly sharp) cheddar cheese...still pretty boring. How about some onions, tomatoes, avocado, pesto?"}
{"text":"Awesome bar, nice ambience.  Loved the pretzels and the wagyu sliders, only mistake we made was to order entrées with our appetizers, the appetizers were huge.  Made a great gin and tonic too.  Staff were friendly, all in all a great night."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch because the Old Fashioned was too busy.  The decor sets one's mind back to a rustic 1980's bar with modern TVs.  The actual setup is a bit awkward and tailored more to a bar than a resteraunt but it is called Cooper's Tavern.  The food was decent with a few minor execution errors (too much cayenne, over and under poached eggs, way too much salt).  Did find a hair in one of our plates.  The service was good though.  Overall an average place with average food.  I would imagine it is better for the bar scene"}
{"text":"We ordered the poutine. No gravy and was flavorless! Beer pretzels were gross!!! Ran out of Caesar dressing so couldn't get a salad. Bottom line, don't come here for the food. Just the beer and cute wait staff."}
{"text":"Do you know what a Cooper is?  You will when you review the bar menu.

I have eaten here several times (dinner, lunch and brunch) and I give the tavern 4 stars because I always have a good meal and a new and exciting beer every time I come here. 

A big group of us showed up on a Saturday night and although we had to wait (it was a Saturday night after all), the maître de was great.  He kept us in formed and eventually put together a couple of smaller tables to get us seated since the folks at the big table wouldn't leave!

A mix of appetizers (Poutine and Roast Beef Rockets), chili (Texas Red and Sweet potato) Salads (Sweet Corn Caesar and Amy's), sandwiches (veggie and hamburgers) along with lots of drinks were consumed and thoroughly enjoyed.   

It can get a little cramped inside (outside seating was still there but Winter is on its way) but overall, the staff was great, the food was great and there were enough TVs that everyone could keep up with college football and the World Series."}
{"text":"First, the space is really cool looking. It's definitely got the well-worn gastropub feel, even though it's brand new. I was really impressed with the decor, even though it isn't quite as charming as some of the other nearby establishments (though if it sticks around for a while, that will come with age). On a Friday night at around 8pm, our little twosome got right in even though I was worried that there would be a wait. We were seated near the kitchen, which meant waitresses flying around too close to my chair for comfort, but at least we got to eat soon after we arrived. We had to try the poutine, skin-on french fries with some cheese curds covered in a brown gravy (have I mentioned how my boy loves gravy?). What a tasty treat, although I think it had sat somewhere for a little bit too long because the gravy had taken on an unappealing sheen. That being said, it tasted great and the fries weren't soggy at all. This is a great alternative to cheesy bacon fries, if you're into that sort of thing. This is not health food. For our dinners I went with the reuben (with house-cured lean corn beef sliced thin, cured red cabbage, swiss cheese, and dressing on pumpernickel) and he had the burger, which was very juicy. For my side I chose the greens with house vinaigrette and he had homemade potato chips. Both of these were great, and I appreciate the lighter choice of greens (they definitely don't scrimp on portions either.. I got half a plate of romaine!). We were very satisfied with the food we'd chosen. I also got a Murphy's Irish Ale, served in a true pint glass. Our server was attentive, no complaints there. The only thing I was a bit bothered by was the beer options. While the bottle selection was just fine, I'm a draft girl and there weren't that many appealing options. Hopefully the cooper's tavern will have a rotating schedule and maybe offer this poor grad student some specials (maybe pitcher specials) so that I can continue to eat my way through the menu one weekend at a time!"}
{"text":"I moved away from Madison a month ago, and Cooper's is one of the places I most miss. I would have considered myself a regular (I dined there about once a week).

The beer list is unmatched. I'd recommend asking the waiters if they've recently received anything new, because I'd frequently been able to get something obscure and great that hadn't hit the menu yet. The food is similarly excellent. Although it is simple, I would recommend the grilled cheese (the tomato soup that comes with it is a nice touch). I also regularly enjoyed the polenta and the beet hummus.

Definitely sit by the window if you can. The view of the square and the capitol building is beautiful.

The one slight negative: this is a small space, so when it gets crowded it gets loud. I'd recommend stopping in on a week night to get the full effect and the best service."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday. It was busy we had a few beers while we waited on a table. Scotch eggs where very good. Large selection of beer, service was okay, the reubin sandwhich was great, as was the fish and chips. The mussels where just okay and i wouldn't have them again."}
{"text":"My Husband and me had dinner on Saturday night, i had the reuben and my Husband had the steak frites, they were both awesome, the decor is pleasant and the wait staff were great, sat at the bar and enjoyed the friendly conversations with the bartenders, we will be going back :}"}
{"text":"My favorite spot downtown. Great capital view, great food and beer selection.  Go here for my birthday every year. Only downsides are no reservations and parking if you don't live downtown."}
{"text":"Loved Coopers! So incredibly lucky to stumble upon this place our very first night in Madison for work! So incredibly sad for everywhere we've eaten after Coopers since they just can't compete with our experience there. 

I have to admit I was hesitant about the food we would encounter in Madison (sorry but I've spent a lot of time in the Midwest and usually end up bloated and searching for greens/veggies/roughage).  Coopers totally blew me away with its perfect blend of pub/comfort food faves, locavore love, and the best things about Midwestern food (its true roots). By the time I left I was wondering why we can't have a Coopers in our town!

My meal was a delicious bavarian beef stew with German dumplings, REAL German dumplings for those who love them, artisan beer and brussels sprouts. The plate was so big, I cannot believe I ate the whole thing but it was sooooo good.  And did mention this is a regular menu item, not a special?

Their drink menu, including a nice and reasonably priced selection of wines by the glass, specialty cocktails, and an astonishing selection of beers, is impressive! And the staff was awesome!  You know where I'll be eating when I'm back in Madison next week."}
{"text":"The only thing keeping this place from 5 is the little tables and layout that packs you in.  Bone marrow kicks ass and the beer menu rocks.  Monks Sour Flemish Ale is the bomb.....the 6 bucks a glass is not the bomb......"}
{"text":"Would have given a 4* review IF it the space was larger. We stopped for dinner on a Friday and got a table within 1 beer. This, however, is not the norm. Usually the bar is 4 deep and the wait for a table is over an hour.  The beer list is spectacular, I always find something I can't get any place else in Madison.  Ommegang Hennepin - YEAH! The food was terrific, as well as the service spot on.  I only wish the latest visit wasn't a fluke...typically we peek in and decide it's waaay too crowed and move on.  Can't you guys expand to the upstairs space????  NOTE:  Coopers is expanding!!!  Yes!!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food! We only tried the poutine and the sliders from the appetizer menu! Both were two thumbs up, amazing! Very large beer menu as well:) best part was it was within walking distance of our hotel and a lot of other places!!!"}
{"text":"I have now been here both times I've been in Madison and I cannot adequately describe how delicious their poutine is. We didn't even need to look at the menu the second time but ordered it right away. The only problem is that the poutine is rather filling, so finishing whatever else you order may be a struggle. I've sat by the window both times and enjoyed the view of the capitol. There's a great beer list as well."}
{"text":"Amazing beer list that goes for pages, food that has not yet disappointed, and friendly staff that ensures you are having a great experience. New local favorite."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. Awesome beer list to choose from. Everyone walks away happy from the bar. More importantly, the only place that I know of that serves Putine! That delicious medley from north of the border. French fries with melted cheese curds smothered in brown gravy. A salty, gooey delicious mess of delight. Thanks Cooper's for bringing that to Madison. I got a little tired of the drive everytime I needed a Putine fix!

The only negative about this place, it is always very loud in there. Hard to have a conversation without yelling. The acoustics are really bad."}
{"text":"Went here after 9pm on a Saturday night. We wanted to sit outside- the place was packed inside and out, so had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. Glad we sat outside though, as inside was really loud.

Awesome beer and wine selection, just about anything you could want. My friend was unhappy with his bloody mary, didn't have enough spice. We were told the kitchen closed at 10, so we had to hurry up and get our orders in. I had the brisket sandwich, which I thought lacked flavor and was pretty unimaginative. Wish I would have ordered the beef stew- it was really tasty and comfort food at its best.

The service was pretty good despite how busy the place looked. The whole experience was decent, but probably won't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Unimpressed.  My husband and I walk in and a very polite man tells us there is no room on this floor, to either go upstairs or downstairs.  Um, k?  We go upstairs and are seated immediately.  No one comes by for our drink order for forever, the girl who finally does knows nothing.  The menu has something about a beer of the month.  I ask her what is this, to which she responds 'I don't know, it changes every day, I don't think we have one.\" Uhhhh huh.  My husband and I ordered cheese curds from her before reviewing the menu, just assuming they had some, and we were brought fries with cheese and gravy.  They were good enough, but not at all cheese curds.  
Now a guy finally comes by and says he's our waiter.  He goes on a rant about how they have NO specials (it's a Friday night).  Our friend wanted fish so questions him.  He is flustered and a bit rude to her, she only wanted to know if there was some kind of Friday night fish.  Geez sorry dood.  Guess you don't like tips.  
My pork belly mac was meh.  Would have been better if they just skipped the pork all together and just made it a vegetarian mac and cheese dish.  My husbands rueben had waaaaaaaaay too much meat and not nearly enough of anything else.  He was disappointed.  
1 star for accommodating our friend with Celiac.  1 star for sparking a fun conversation about how much to tip for sub par service."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever tonight! Came here for dinner at 9 p.m., we were told the late night menu started a bit early, which we found acceptable. We sat outside and ordered our drinks and food at the same time, roughly at 9:10 p.m. At 10 p.m. we were told our food was given to the wrong table with the exact same order and  ours would be here ASAP. As of right now, 10:25 p.m., we still have no food. Our food order was simple Reuben and a medium well burger, neither should take more than 25 minutes. To end it all, we still had to seek out our server to cancel our food, as we had to leave... and we got an apology and a bill for our drinks. Given our experience, I am surprised that they gave us a bill at all. 


Thank you for the worst experience ever in 10 plus  years I've lived in Madison."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just went here for an early dinner on Sunday and we were really quite excited about the place.  The atmosphere is like a dark sophisticated pub, the food is upscale but not too pricey, TONS of beer options, and the servers and clientele not too pretentious which we were worried about.  My boyfriend is a Reuben aficionado and so he tried that, I loved it, he said it was kind of chewy but it had this different flavor to it that we've never tasted before.  Overall he gave it a thumbs up.  We shared the poutine appetizer which was overwhelmingly gluttonous but wonderfully executed and tasty.  I had the fish and chips with a house salad instead of chips.  I felt it was kind of a normal fish and chips, good but nothing exciting about it, and I wished there was some sort of tarter sauce to add some flavor.

Overall we thought the food was great and different, loved the atmosphere, and we'll be back soon.   Rating: 4.5"}
{"text":"Excellent beer/cider selection with many of them offered on tap. The food is original and delicious (I had the grilled cheese - a less exciting options I'll admit - which was phenomenal). The waiter I had was helpful & attentive. I'd highly recommend it as a dinner destination."}
{"text":"I tried the pork belly mac.  It was just ok.  I had a very small piece of pork belly and it was very fatty, I couldn't really eat it.  The mac and cheese sauce is more like alfredo sauce... not what I expected.  A good beer selection though."}
{"text":"Awesome food and tap beer offering!  Saturday and Sunday mornings are made for brunch and soccer at Coopers!  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Had heard a lot about this place, but was not that good. Outdoor seating seemed exciting because of capital view but seats were uncomfortable with no back support and kept bouncing when someone got up. It was a busy day so service was not good! They undercooked our burger and had to overdo (never asked us how we like it in the first place). You can probably guess how much extra we had to wait! 
Quality of burger was low! 
The only good part was the dessert! We loved the creme brûlée!"}
{"text":"Colin U was spot on in his review. Great bar, and the owner Pete is genuinely nice guy."}
{"text":"They have a very nice beer list that rotates often and has many representative midwest micros. The poutine was very good, gravy and curds were excellent, but the fries were a bit heavy handed with the salt. The fries are tasty (if there were a bit less salt they'd be perfect) but they are hand cut and nice and crispy.

It was very busy at the time I was there (approx 830pm on a Tuesday night). Its a bit cramped so be prepared to get cozy and be prepared to wait a bit, but with all that good beer who doesn't want to stick around?"}
{"text":"The food at this places was very good... Alcohol prices were pretty cheap and they have a large selection of pretty much everything. The chicken sandwich was pretty good, as for the chips they were burnt. Food took forever and did not come out at the same time. Service was very slow despite being one of the 4 tables in the place. I'd go back next time I am in town, but will seat at the bar."}
{"text":"Wow! Great place for lunch and it's right by the Capitol!  Three of us went and ordered the same thing: soup and salad.  I had the special: cauliflower soup and my two friends ordered the tomato soup.  Delicious!  

All three of us ordered the Beet Salad.  The combination of the ingredients in the salad was perfect and the dressing was the right amount.

What's nice about the menu is that the choices are limited.  I like going to places where there aren't 25+ things to choose from.  The select menu lists items that have been perfected and are served fresh."}
{"text":"This is a limited review, very limited.

We stopped at The Cooper's Tavern for drinks on a whim because we have some time before our dinner reservation and thought we'd check it out.

Since it was before dinner, we were in the mood for cocktails. In retrospect, we should have went with something from the well-stocked beer list instead.  Both my wife and I ordered a vodka gimlet.  When it finally arrived (through no fault of the server, the bartender was just pfaffing around and talking to other drinkers while he should have been also making drinks), we were disappointed.  The drinks seemed to be largely composed of ice and rose's lime juice; vodka was in short supply and there was no lime wedge.  Lame, just lame.

We sat at one of the tables in the front of the house, the one's made from a barrel with a tabletop.  Comfortable enough, but it's pretty damned cold that close to the front window in the middle of winter (and I'm not easily chilled).  The rest of the decor seems a bit confused (rustic bar on one side, pseudo-modern restaurant on the other, barrel tables up front).

We didn't stay to eat, so I won't speak to that.  Not sure if we'll return for dinner or not, but if we do, it will have to be soon.  It seems like Food Fight restaurants have a rather quick aging curve when it comes to the food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for their Sunday brunch and it's been delightful. I live just around the corner from Old Fashioned, but I'll walk the extra block to Cooper's Tavern any day for what I consider to be superior food, service and wait time. It's always busy, but I never need to wait for a table (score!). 

My boyfriend and I start out with the Sconnie Egg appetizer: Sausage-wrapped egg deep-fried and served with whole grain mustard? Nom nom nom. 

The first time I had the Scandinavian Eggs Benedict which was pretty good (I was hungover which was coloring my enjoyment of the food), but this morning I had the Blueberry Mascarpone French Toast on Sourdough and I nearly died. Even my bf liked it and he doesn't believe in breakfast foods :) He got their Sunday Roast (Yorkshire pudding, roast beef, mashed veggies and thick gravy) and it was succulent and very tasty.

Sitting outside is really fun, today it started raining in the middle of our meal so we ran inside and they found us a table even though the place was packed! Both of our servers have been charming and very attentive. Only reason I'm not going for 5 stars is I've had better Eggs Benedict and I haven't tried any of their drinks yet. 

Yay Food Fight restaurants!"}
{"text":"I am never super impressed with the taste of the food.  The last time I went I got a grilled chicken sandwich and it was the texture of a chicken patty."}
{"text":"****UPDATE: 8/2/16 - After posting my review, both the operations manager and the event liaison reached out to me to apologize for the lack of service my group received. I am relieved to know that Coopers does care and are concerned with customer service.****"}
{"text":"Great addition to the square...lots of good beers, the service has been solid and the word of mouth must be good, so it's usually pretty crowded...which makes The Cooper's Tavern great for people watching...

The food I have had has been good...salad dressing was just right, the cottage pie tasty...I used to live in Montreal, so I won't lie and say the Poutine is perfect, but it does its comfort food job just fine...

If Cooper's folks are reading...use the white bits of curd, rather than the orange sheets of curd currently deployed...

Bottom line though...it's a crowd-pleasing smash hit!"}
{"text":"Dined at 11:30 on a Wednesday afternoon. My friend and I were the only people there at the time but closer to noon the place fills up. I ordered the Amys salad and my friend ordered the veggie sandwich. My salad was excellent, the fried goat cheese alone was enough to make me want to come back. I tried a portion of the veggie sandwich, which was an unusual take on a sandwich, but it was thoughtfully crafted to be delicious. Service was great, very attentive, but not suffocating. I would go back to try their dinner offerings and beverage selection."}
{"text":"The plus: I had a delicious dinner of pretzel-crusted chicken with a hash made of brussels sprouts and squash.

The diappointments: Seating and service. Seating: I was part of a group of 10 that was seated in the \"snug,\" a little wooden cubby off the bar. The table would seat six appropriately, not 10, and the stools we sat on were low and uncomfortable. With ten people in there, the voices bounced off the sides and made for a loud and irritating space. What's more, every time someone needed to get out of the space to go to the bathroom, those at the table between them and the entrance to the snug needed to get up and step outside the space, then repeat when they returned. What a bad concept!

Service: The bartender, who served us through a window in one of the walls, seemed to rely on charm rather than knowledge or good service. I indicated that I was thinking about having the reisling with my dinner and asked if he thought that was a good pairing. His response was that it was good becuase red would be ordered with red meat. (If he thinks that's what makes a good wine pairing, he is really ignorant and should not work at a bar that serves only beer and wine!) It didn't matter, though, because I never got my wine. He spent at least five minutes telling us why separate checks might not be possible, then provided them anyhow.  (Either you do or don't -- make up your mind. Personally, I understand why a server would not provide separate checks and I would not have even asked, but someone else in the group did.) His recommendations of items on the menu seemed entirely based upon telling us about the awards that the pub had gotten. I was not impressed.

In addition, being served through a window at the end of the table meant that all food and drinks needed to be passed down the table to those of us at the other end; the same with dirty dishes/glasses. Annoying.

I was SO glad to leave that noisy, crowded, and poorly served place. I felt like I was bursting into freedom as I left the restaurant. A good piece of chicken does not make up for the unplesantness."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere (\"coolest\" fans I've ever seen in a restaurant ;) and delicious lunch! My only gripe is that I love Amy's Salad so much that I find it hard to branch out on the menu (not to say that everything else I've tried has been wonderful too)."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped here on a Friday around 7PM and were seated outside.  It took about 10 minutes for any server to come by to take our drink orders (she didn't ask if we wanted to order food yet, which we did.  We had to wait another 15 minutes for that).  
Beer selection is the best thing about this place.  I had a Reuben and it was probably the worst one I've ever had.  They didn't slice the meat like every other place does but chopped the meat up into little bits and integrated it into the sauerkraut into some sort of weird hash.  Worse, they were really skimpy on the amount of \"hash\" they put in the sandwich.  It was easily half the amount other places in Madison put in their Reuben.  And the Thousand Island dressing was about 800 islands too few.  Really bland taste with no flavor to speak of.  My friend ordered chicken with poutine but they didn't put any topping on it - it was just fries.  Come for the beer but be prepared for slow service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Met a few friends for dinner last night- we were seated right away, but it was very early.  As we were eating, the place filled up very quickly so keep that in mind.  
The menu was varied with both pub foods, salads and entrees- I really enjoyed the Amy's salad and I'm not really a fan of spinach but it was delish.  The veggie sandwich was likewise satisfying and the service was just fine.  Overall, we were impressed and will plan to return often."}
{"text":"Just in for drinks, but had an awesome time and experience. The bar tenders (Bree & Cody) were fantastic. We never had an empty glass of water which is crucial when enjoying all they had to offer for Madison Craft Beer Week. They shared fun notes on the beer and were very friendly. We did try the cheese curds and they are now one of our faves in the city for that category. The dill dip served with them was awesome! We will be back and look forward to having a meal. We hear the pork belly Mac is delicious."}
{"text":"Packed on a Wednesday night - which I think tells you a lot.  Good draft selection, attentive service and good food.  Will definitely be back when I am next in Madison."}
{"text":"This is the best place on the Capitol Square! Staff is very helpful and friendly, while the food is fresh, local and reasonably priced. I frequent Cooper's a lot for the friendly service and the great beer list!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying this restaurant should have a higher rating, but for one serious mistake, which I'll get to.

Service - Excellent.  Our server was charming, knew the food & beer, fast and efficient.

Food - Fairly good.  The presentation was great, but the Poutine was just cheese fires with gravy.  Now having spent much time in Montreal, i'm a bit of a poutine purist, so perhaps I'm being a bit harsh.  Fish and chips were good, thought the fries weren't quite up to \"chip\" standards.

Drink - EXCELLENT!  What a killer beer list, and the staff knew their stuff.

Ambiance - Very good.  Maybe turn down the lights a bit.

THE BAD:   We were really enjoying the food when my friend found a BIG PIECE OF PLASTIC IN HIS BURGER.  It was the kind that patties often come wrapped in.  This was not a small piece either, it was a ball of thick, clear plastic the size of 2 peas.

My friend was very gracious and knew the cook.  He told the server to tease him about it but didn't raise a stink - didn't mention it to the owner either.  I wouldn't have been so gracious - hence the 3 star review for a 4 star place."}
{"text":"I went to Cooper's with my parents for my birthday dinner.  Walking in you are immediately impressed with the decor and the crowd packed into the narrow space. We started off with some great drinks at the bar due to the 30 minute wait at 9pm on a Saturday night.  Bartenders were friendly and prompt.  The Snoqualmie naked organic wine was particularly awesome. Beer selection adveturous and tasty.  
  Once we finally got seated is where the night soured a bit and the reason for the 3 stars.  Our waitress was as efficient as a broken broom. She did not deliver our food.  Not a big deal except for the fact she never once checked in on us to ask how the food was and such.  The next time we saw her after taking our order was to drop off the check after we flagged her down.  I had to verbally call her over to the table to get a new glass of wine as she was never around to cue with a simple hand gesture. Collecting her check quickly was the only skill she possessed.

  However, the food was delicious. I had the pork belly mac and cheese. The way the pork flavors mixed with the mac and cheese seasonings was superb. My parents got a pair of sandwiches which were solid. 
  I would definitely go back simply for the beer and wouldn't mind eating there again provided I wouldn't be served by that waitress again."}
{"text":"A 45 minute wait turned into a 70 minute wait.  No exaggeration.
Food was adequate but nothing spectacular.
Menu is very limited.
Beer list was vast, but so are the beer lists elsewhere.  
Far too small for large groups.  Couples should have no problems but groups of 4 or more will have to wait forever for a table.
Very loud, probably due to the cramped environment.
They do stand out a little from the normal Food Fight establishment but I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went for brunch because the old fashioned had a line.  Big mistake.  Took forever to get service.  Food was weak.  Crab cake Benedict was lousy and not fresh.  Bagels were stale.  Nobody in our 6 person group liked our meal."}
{"text":"This place is great. Tasty food, awesome beer selection, and fantastic, helpful waitstaff. I love the atmosphere and the location, too. Have only had the appetizers (the hand made potato chips are awesome!) and beer, but every other dish I saw come out looked amazing. And it's pretty reasonably priced for the quality.  

Would recommend taking advantage of their beer samples as they have a diverse mix that are hard to find other places. 

Definitely worth the stop!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise Cooper's was the other day! I was expecting a bar but it was so much more...To put it bluntly, this was some of the simplest, best tasting fare I have ever had at a tavern. In fact, even if it were not a tavern, I would go back for the food. The tomato-roasted red pepper soup was so stunningly good, I wish I had the recipe because I'm now craving it constantly. I then had the veggie sandwich. Now, I've had a veggie sandwich many, many times at many different eating establishments and believe me when I say that there are as many interpretations of this idea as there are eating establishments. This one was DELICIOUS. I have no idea what they did to it to make it taste so good but literally every component sung with flavor, including the nicely toasted Madison Sourdough bread. There was portobella mushroom, peppers, feta and zucchini and it was accompanied by a fairly large helping of mixed greens which were dressed (perhaps a bit too heavily) with a kind of Dijon topping that was also extremely tasty. My only complaint was that it was too creamy for me. Aside from the food, Cooper's has an extensive beer list and a very attractive interior comprised of blonde wood tables and floors and a large picture window looking out onto the capitol. We went two days after Christmas and they were doing a very brisk lunch business so I can only imagine what it must be like on a regular workday. I'll definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"On the beautiful second floor of Coopers Tavern we hosted a Happy Hour for what we thought was going to be about 30 clients and ended up turning into a Happy Hour for about 50+ clients.  The Coopers Tavern staff worked with us to make sure every guest was served promptly at the bar and when our appetizer table started to run low (due to the awesome turnout) their main kitchen staff pulled together and allowed us to order additional appetizers from their main menu!!  We could not have been more pleased with their Events Coordinator and the staff for that evening.  Our guests really enjoyed the laid back atmosphere and set up of Coopers because it allowed them to mingle comfortably with our staff and other guests.  The view of the capital was an added bonus!"}
{"text":"What a local gem! I was so happy that my path led me right to this Tavern. Something about it caught my eye as I was sightseeing in Madison and I am so glad it did. I sat at the window looking out onto the Capitol grounds as I ate the most delicious pork sandwich and homemade potato chips. The deconstructed presentation of the sandwich may have been what made this dish work so well. The perfect blend of tangy and sweet. I'm a fan! Too bad I was only in Madison for a few hours!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place. Plenty of comfort food for those cold nights and a nice beer collection on tap."}
{"text":"I've eat here a couple times and it was fantastic. The menu is nice and short, but you can't go wrong with the selections. Save your decision make for what to drink. 

Location: Great view of the Capitol right in the square. The restaurant itself is small but cozy. You be sharing stories with your neighbors. 

Food: I've only had lunch but the Poutine was yummy. I can't believe we didn't invent that before the neighbors to the North. Turkey sandwich Is fantastic and nothing beats homemade chips. 

Drinks: if you can't find something you like then there us something wrong with you. 28 beers on tap with over a hindered in the bottle. 40 different wines if that is your poison. I had the Hennipen from Coopers Town delicious."}
{"text":"My buddies and I stopped be the night before the OSU football game. Everything was crowded but this place had an outside patio. I believe I overheard our waiter say it was his second day so he was visibly overwhelmed but he did try his hardest. We did wait a long time for food and drinks but the food was amazing. Two of my buddies had the Rueben in which they both said it was really good and I had the sliders that were perfectly cooked and juicy. The food was very good and I would stop by if I am ever in Madison again."}
{"text":"What an unbelievably amazing place to go. This is by-far my favorite place to go on a slower night rather than the party scene. Go in there have a few delicious exotic beers and talk to some down-right friendly people. The owner Pete is awesome as well. All the waiters, waitresses, bar tenders, and of course Pete make you feel like family who just got home. It's an absolutely wonderful place to go. BE SURE TO TRY A DARK AND STORMY DOWN THERE!"}
{"text":"Coopers is by far one of the best spots in town! My husband and I not only hosted our rehearsal dinner in their upstairs dining space, but we also stop by for their awesome beer selection, rustic elegant decor, and great customer service. We love their fish fry and beet humus. I would highly recommend checking out Coopers for private events, cocktails, brunch, or dinner. Oh, and they are also an English Premier League bar if you are a soccer fan!"}
{"text":"Went to Cooper's Tavern on a Saturday night around 9 PM with friends. I guess it could have been the time of night but a couple of the items we wanted to order were out for the evening. Boo. We ended up ordering the poutine and the pretzel with cheese to start. The pretzel was good but the poutine was disappointing. Not nearly enough of the \"good stuff\"  to coat the fries properly. I ordered the sweet corn Caesar as my entree thinking it sounded delicious but when the dish came I was totally disappointed. There was hardly any taste or flavor to it. I love caesar salads but this was just bland. The hard boiled egg that came on top of the salad was pink so I got a little excited thinking it would be pickled. It was not. The question still remains why was the egg pink if it wasn't pickled? My boyfriend and I also shared the french onion soup. We get french onion soup anywhere that has it on the menu, but again the broth lacked flavor. While I definitely wouldn't come here again for the food, they do have a lovely location on the capital with very nice decor! I especially liked the long booth across the entire length of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Beer selection! Food was fantastic. Chorizo sandwich and Amy's salad. Fresh and fast."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favorites, but the last time I was there, it was pretty disappointing. The menu was much smaller than it used to be, and an old favorite (Cobb Caesar) was subpar: salty, rubbery chicken, not as many vegetables, smaller portion overall and no presentation. I hope they improve soon!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and try not to go back.  I wish there were more decent dining options on the Square for entertaining out-of-town guests...

Anyway, the first time I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich.  I don't really like grilled cheese and only order them when there are no palatable meat-free options.  It was the usual mess of grease on bread.  The highlight was the shot of harvest soup, but again that was only a shot.  

The second time we came here was because The Old Fashioned was too busy.  I was fine with that because I'm not a fan of their food, but my friends were visiting and were really excited about the variety of cheese curds.

To make up for the lack of cheese curds, we ordered the poutine.  Having traveled extensively in Canada, I can say this was a far cry from the original (true, we did get the gravy on the side).  The cheese was lumpy, waxy mess in the middle, and the fries were cold and soggy.  We didn't even finish them, and who doesn't finish their fries?!

I really liked the Venetian Manicotti, though the buckwheat crepe was rather grainy.  That could be the nature of buckwheat, I'm not sure.  I'd definitely order it again, especially if I come here with someone I don't want to talk to.

My friends all seemed reasonably pleased with their meals, though it was hard to tell because I couldn't hear a word they said.  Between the horrendous acoustics and multiple TVs (with the volume on!), my friends and I quickly learned any attempt at conversation was fruitless.  The whole meal made me feel sad and lonely, because I could see my friends but not talk to them.  It made us eat quickly and run out of there.  One positive note:  I think all the ambient noise mimicked the sounds of my friend's womb.  Her little baby slept through the whole meal.  It was quite nice for us grown-ups.  Too bad we couldn't talk to each other about how lovely it was to have adult conversation.

I don't drink beer, so I ordered a Magner's.  It came in a pint glass, which I'm sure would have been appreciated if I were an alcoholic or like to consume 1500 calories per meal.  I drank less than half of it.  It would be nice to have smaller portions, for those of us who don't like to feel the need purge upon dining."}
{"text":"I probably built this place up in my mind too much before I ended up here. It's been awhile since I've been to Canada and I've been having a craving for poutin. After consulting Yelp I found this place as somewhere in the US I might go for my fix. Since I had a business trip planned to Milwaukee it wasn't much more of a drive to get to Madison. I figured if there was a place outside of Ontario or Quebec to get good poutin it had to be Wisconsin, home of the cheese curd. So on a rainy afternoon I headed to Madison. The first bringdown about this place is its location so close to the capital. Trying to park anywhere near Cooper's is a pain. And when it's raining it's even worse. Having finally found parking I then ran in the rain to get to the restaurant. I get in, am immediately seated and get a menu. A big positive  for the place is its beer selection. I was able to get a draft of a California beer I like cheaper there than when I am in California. I ordered poutin and sliders from the menu. The poutin came out first and my heart sank after seeing it. It was made with YELLOW cheese curds and the gravy was like a light brown sausage gravy. Most horrible. EVERYBODY knows poutin is made with WHITE cheese, mozzarela, montery jack or even cheddar, and a thick BROWN gravy. Broke my heart when it came out. The taste wasn't much better. The gravy and fries were barely warm so the cheese couldn't melt which made the whole thing an unappetizing mess. The sliders weren't bad but I hadn't come for the sliders. After eating I trudged back to my car in the rain. Pricewise not bad for beer but a bit pricey for the quality (or lack thereof) of the food. 3 stars for the good beer price."}
{"text":"Cooper's is a great place for a quick and tasty lunch if you're up in the Capitol area.  It's kinda hidden---I've walked by it a million times but never stopped there.  

I've had three meals there---a chicken sandwich (delicious) and Amy's salad (twice).  The first time the salad was amazing.  The second time, the apple they shred over the salad was brown and soggy.  It was a little gross, to say the least.  I pushed it to the side and continued on my way.  I've also had the pretzel appetizer, which is very good.  My friend raves about the grilled cheese.

Expect to spend about $10-$15.  I haven't gotten around to trying any of the beers, but they have an impressive selection.  Check this place out, especially if you work downtown.  They are very conscientious about getting you in and out of there in an hour if you have lunch time constraints."}
{"text":"This place is a heart attack in a box. Waygu everything..bacon..cheese..fried. How about a simpler chicken breast, a turkey sandwich or a non aggressively fat burger choice?  Even the salads were loaded with cheese and/or lardons."}
{"text":"I went to Cooper's Tavern on a friday evening and was not as satisfied as I hoped. The service was great and my party of 2 got a table quickly,  however we were sat right next to the kitchen and all the tables were very close together. 

As for the food, I ordered the poutine as an appetizer and the brisket sandwich as my meal. The two were brought out withing minutes of each other making the appetizer irrelevant.  The appetizer was coldish and no wherd close to as good as it sounded on the menu. The brisket sandwich was giant and paired with a small salad. The meat was tender but lacked flavor. The redeeming quality of the sandwich was the bacon aioli used. Yum yum yum!! I would probably order just bread and aioli rather than thr whole sandwich.

Next time, if there is a next time, I think ill order their burger or fish. They both looked much better than what I had."}
{"text":"Service was quick and after a moment, friendly. Great beer selection. I got Amy's salad to go. Though it said it came with balsamic vinegraitte, when I got back to my hotel, it was a mustard, garlic, truffle creamy dressing. For me, that worked out even better."}
{"text":"Two of our very good friends, my husband, and I wanted a night out at a new Madison eatery.  It was a Sat. night without reservations.  Thankfully we found a spot at the bar and enjoyed a few beverages before dinner.  The bartender offered samples and suggestions to the various beers we were interested in.  My husband has Celiac, several options were present.  Yes, the variety and knowledge of beverages was exceptional but the food was lacking.  
My husband ordered the pork chop, it came out (too) rare and was sent back.  They comped us for this thankfully.  My girlfriend and I ordered the chicken curry dish.  The chicken was tender but extremely salty!  It was if they had brined the chicken over night.  The curry sauce was very comfort food yummy.  I know it's a European/Canadian thing to have gravy covered fries but I'm not a fan.  Our friend ordered the mussels and loved them!  
We shared desserts of Creme Brulee - Delish!!!  and chocolate cheese cake (i think) - dry and blah
Not a fan of the menu, or options (too few).  Like i read in previous reviews, i 'd go for drinks but not the food."}
{"text":"PEOPLE!!!!

I specifically downloaded this app and have been fervently typing my first ever review, just so I could give Coopers 5 stars. My boyfriend and I are broke college kids, and we still make the time (and scrounge up the money) to go here around once a week. And when we don't, I miss it! And here's why: THE SLIDERS!!! The sliders are under the appetizer section and I can only assume are the best kept secret on the menu. They. Are. Amazing!!! I'm a burger person (it's my favorite food) so I've eaten A LOT of burgers in my day, but I think these are my favorite. I ordered them the first time I went to Coopers, and I've never looked back. I'm not kidding you, they're the best burgers I think I've ever had. 
Even though they're under the appetizer menu, I order them for my meal. They come with their chips, so it's definitely enough to feed a person and I've never left hungry (I even have a large appetite!)! If anything, you'll be left licking the plate clean even though you're already beyond stuffed! Like I said, they come with chips, but I strongly recommend upgrading to the frites!!! It's an upcharge of $1.50 I believe, but so worth it! And don't forget the malt vinegar aioli. I wasn't sure how I felt about it at first, but now I'm addicted! As for my sliders, everything that comes on them is delicious. I get mine cooked medium-well and add raw onion, because I think there's just something about the burger and onion combo that can't be beat! 
I've also has the pretzels with beer cheese dip which was very yummy, and I've tried my boyfriend's food several times (the pork belly Mac, the chicken pot pie, the steak frites) and all of it was good, but the true gem is the sliders!!!! I'm risking my reputation here, and maybe it's just the perfect combination for my very picky tastebuds, but they are so worth giving a try. 
So once again, if you like burgers get the sliders (add onion if you want to be like me), upgrade to frites, and don't forget the malt vinegar aioli!!! Please people, do yourself a favor!!!!"}
{"text":"I was in town for business for a week and have been to Cooper's twice. Nice atmosphere and good service. It's the first establishment where I felt welcome after being in Madison for three days. Can't wait to go home."}
{"text":"You know you're in trouble when the beer menu is longer than the food menu. And when I say \"trouble\" you know I mean \"paradise\".   Our server was quite knowledgeable and was able to describe various beers and helped steer us towards things we'd like and may not have noticed or tried.

The place was bustling with an energetic dinner crowd on a Tuesday night, but fortunately we were seated immediately. The interior is casual and charming, it feels inviting with the wood floors, old fashioned triple ceiling fan and brick walls.

We started with the fresh baked soft pretzels ($3.95) which I can't say I'd try again.  They tasted more like simply bread sticks than pretzels.  Fortunately the pretzel roll served with the burger seemed much more on target!  Whew.  

Being the family veg, I was pleased there were several vegetarian items on the menu, including several soup options (yay!). I opted for a bowl of the Sweet Potato Chili ($6.95) which was hearty and had enough (but not too much) of a kick.  While there were several vegetarian entrees (grilled veggie sandwich, grilled cheese, or venetian manicotti)  I elected for a salad (cue anti-climatic music).  Fortunately, my salad itself was not anti-climatic. The house salad ($5.95) was a perfect size and sported freshly grated Parmesan and croutons. AND a chunk of sourdough bread (yup, this on TOP of my cornbread with my soup - this carb lover's dreams DO come true!).  

And true to form, the Mister declared his Cooper's Burger delish - I've been hearing about the \"pork belly\" topping ever since.  Ah yes, yet another place the vegetarian & carnivore can dine in peace."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were looking for a place for a snack and a late night drink on my recent visit to Madison. As we walked around the Capitol we struggled to find a place that wasn't so crowded and loud that we couldn't converse, but one that still have some energy and atmosphere. Then we happened upon Coopers. Full, but we were able to get a table. We had a fantastic waiter who made sure we had just what we wanted. Pretzel appetizer was exceptional and the drink selections perfect. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nice little place by the capitol. Great place to grab some drinks or get some brunch. Other than brunch, the only time I had food was when we had to get an appetizer to drink our beers at a table. Didn't really feel like getting any food at the time.. but we ended up getting pretzels and cheese or something.. and it was not worth its price. at all. Brunch is good. I got the breakfast sandwich on one occasion and a benedict on another. I was satisfied. I just love the atmosphere and I think if I went for dinner when I was hungry I would have a different review in terms of food. They have the left handed milk stout draught, which is my fave. 

One thing I wasn't a big fan of was that they would constantly ask us if we wanted to order any other drinks or food.. to the point where it felt a little pushy. It passed the point where they are asking to provide good service. 

I want to give it 3.5 stars, but I bumped it because of the atmosphere and pretty satisfied brunch experience. It's a little more than A-OK."}
{"text":"Still good pub food.

I recently tried the fish fry.. mmm mmm mmm. I LIKE IT~! nice fresh fish, but really the batter was kinda thick and flimsy.. at least the flavor was there. The stuffed grilled cheese was really good too.

AND POUTINE! I don't understand why it is so rare in Madison to get Poutine. The gravy sauce and melted cheese on fries? mmm mmm so goooooddd!

It's still crowded and packed, but the wait has improved for food to be served after ordering! Good job, Cooper's crew!"}
{"text":"Brunch at Cooper's Tavern makes you wish you'd grabbed a sandwich at Colectivo instead. The Harvest soup is served lukewarm; there's no telling when it was actually made but it's certain that no one bothered to heat it up. The Elssworth Omelet derives its name from Ellsworth white cheddar cheese curds (one of the alleged ingredients) but I dare you to taste any cheese in it. It's a sad open faced egg concoction with (tasty) roasted tomatoes and a bite and a half of avocado resting on top. The server was nice and the bus boy very polite efficient; enough to earn an extra star. No one asked whether the food was good because, I suspect, they knew the answer."}
{"text":"I was there only for beer. Great attentive and knowledgeable staff with an excellent selection of brews."}
{"text":"I like this place because of the food and the awesome large screen on the top floor for sports events. The bugersrs, etc. are delicious. French onion soup was a bit of a bust, though. It came out late and had a whole wonderbread + campbell's soup mix feeling to it."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Cooper's Tavern, and my husband and I decided to bring our parents with us. It seemed pretty small on the inside and we had 6 people in our party, but it was 5:30 on a Monday evening & not too crowded so we were able to be seated right away.

Our server was very quick and attentive. He was very helpful when my dad needed help choosing a beer and ended up recommending the perfect one for him. He continued to provide excellent service throughout our meal!

Everyone in our party loved the food they ordered, and we all got something different. My husband had the buttered chicken and practically inhaled it he enjoyed it so much. I had the pork belly mac. The macaroni was cooked perfectly and the cheese was delicious. The pork belly that was served on top of the pasta was incredible. I savored every last bite of it. I stole some frites from my mom and those were also delicious.

I really considered giving a 4 star review simply because the place was so noisy and felt pretty cramped at times, but the food was so delicious and the service was great, I think a 5 star review is well-deserved! If you're in a larger group I would suggest going during the week, or sitting outside on the patio. We will definitely recommend it in the future to those looking for a unique place to eat on the square!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a quick bite to eat. We sat at the bar since the restaurant was packed. We decided on a bunch of appetizers and a salad to split between the two of us. We had the poutine, large pretzel, butternut squash soup and and a chicken Caesar salad. Everything was yummy and will definitely go again next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"One of THEE best places to eat in Madison, for sure. It can be a bit loud inside, but who cares. The food and drinks are so delicious. The upstairs bar is very quaint and spacious. Support this bar, it is SO worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food n outstanding beer selections.  First time here. Definitely will be back. Sliders n beer cheese pretzels were outstanding. Beer prices r a little high. Beware."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the restaurant is beautiful, the food is great, and moderately priced. It was a great place to grab lunch in the middle of the week. Beware, it can get quite busy, and there's a good reason for that."}
{"text":"A very nice establishment on Capital Square.  I second the fact that this place has the best beer selection in Madison by far!  Oh, and the food is pretty good to boot!  Very highly recommended if you like trying a BUNCH of different styles of beer!"}
{"text":"Food and beer is excellent, staff leaves something to be desired. Coopers is always crowded and noisy, but it's easy to ignore when the food is amazing. Beer menu is unparalleled in Madison. However something I cannot look past is the inconsiderate staff. If the owner is around, the service is great. If he's not, the hostess forgets about you for 40 minutes. The last time we went, we were told there were no tables available and we had to sit at the table or bar. But there were two tables in front and two smaller tables in back completely open. Our waiter was incompetent and wandered around while simultaneously forgetting some of my food.

What gives, Coopers? Get it together."}
{"text":"In a town of great bars with awesome food, this one left me with no impression. Food was tasty and semi-creative. Drinks were like any other bar of it's style. Location, on the capitol square, was the draw, but...I don't know what more to say."}
{"text":"Waiter was friendly and accommodating. The best service!! Food (hamburgers and fries) was the best! I would give my highest recommendation based on the waiter alone."}
{"text":"Coopers Tavern is solid. Solid food, solid menu, good beer selection, soccer on TV. It is not amazing but it never disappoints. It is like your friend who is very trustworthy but not crazy. Supposing,  that is, that this friend is English."}
{"text":"I had the Steak Freitas and Green Beans dish and it was excellent. Came here for dinner and drinks on New Years Eve and was impressed with the service and overall environment. They have a great draft beer selection as well to compliment their dinner menu. I would recommend this place looking for a good dinner and a beer close to the square."}
{"text":"Just popped in for a pint and some lunch. Sat on the street patio and ordered a Rueben with fries. A really good sandwich on fantastic dark rye bread.

The staff were all excellent and it was a great, warm and friendly spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Sitting in the location that was formerly Sucre - it just goes to show that Wisconsin loves our beer more than our dessert. I got the Mac n cheese with pork belly. My friend got the goat cheese polenta. We also tried the pretzels with beer cheese sauce. Overall, I liked that they have unusual stuff on their menu (polenta, pork belly, brussel sprouts and beets). They've got a selection of beers like so many places in Madison. It's definitely worth a try but it won't end up being a favorite.

Service: Slow, but it was packed. My friend and I got our appetizer after our entrees. Also all the waitresses look the same.
Environment: Nice light wood decor. Most of the tables inside are against a long bench (so you get one seat on the bench and one chair). Tables are really close together. Some outdoor seating. A little bit loud given that I went on a full night.

UPDATE: Went for brunch. Just after it snowed, so it was empty. But by far, I liked the brunch better than the dinner. I got the Benedict Arnold - poached eggs on biscuit with sausage gravy. My friend got the regular Eggs Benedict. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Honestly, the all-around experience of Cooper's Tavern gives this place a unique style. In conjunction with its location on the Square, I am positive it will thrive for years to come!

The food is usually well presented. In fact, I can only recall one specific time where I ate a vegetarian polenta dish that was rather bland and uninteresting (No...the reason for that is NOT because it was a vegetarian option). The atmosphere is very lively, and a drawback from a 5-star rating would be the noise. Cooper's Tavern is certainly noisy, but that's a part of the Euro-tavern charm and experience. Also, as a coffee LOVER (a true one...not simply someone who simply drinks a lot of it), their coffee selection is abysmal. It always tastes bland and even burned at times. I keep forgetting to ask what brand it is, but it doesn't matter. It's just not great and never has been.

One big push toward 4.5 stars, is their brunch. It's delicious!! If you dine on a weekend for brunch, put a group of 6 or more together and dine in the fun, cute, and intimate table closed off to the main area. It's connected right to the bar by a small window where the wait staff interacts with you from the bar area. It's kind of a neat, unique experience!

The fact that I've taken dates, siblings, parents and relatives, co-workers, and friends here numerous times says a lot (even if the coffee stinks)!!"}
{"text":"If you're near the square swing into coopers, friendly staff and the owner is a really nice and genuine guy!  Great tap beer selection too."}
{"text":"After a recent bad experience, the owner of The Coopers Tavern reached out to me via Yelp. He invited me back to give them another chance, on the house. I have to say, I was BLOWN AWAY by the food and their level of service the second time around. Night and day difference. I really enjoyed my sandwich and the pub chips are a must try. This is definitely a place for a great burger, not so much lighter options like salads--that isn't their thing."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. There are not enough positive words to describe my recent experience at Cooper's Tavern. I went after a very, very long day of work and Cooper's was exactly what I needed. They have a terrific on tap and drink menu. So many options that the only bad thing is that you simply can't try them all! 

After drinks, our waitress helped me decide what I wanted to get. I ended up getting the Wagyu beef burger. LIFE CHANGING. The meat was delicious and perfectly cooked. One of the best burgers I have had in Madison thus far. The chips were an added bonus, as well.

Overall, the service, beer, and food were incredible. Definitely recommending this place to all in search of a fun vibe and fabulous food restaurant in Madison. Thank you, Cooper's!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time and the service was not good, the waitress was not friendly or helpful with the menu selection. We did not have the chicken on our salad we ordered with chicken, she didn't bring the baguette that was supposed to come with it, and the salad was not fresh. I would not recommend this place compared to other places I have eaten, it was terrible."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with coworkers.  There were many middle-aged men and women in suits.  As a party of five, we were seated in the back, in a private sectioned off space with flapping Western doors.  It was quite nice.  There was a mini door for the bartender to take our orders and hand us our food.

I had the quiche, which was a huge slice of egg pie with brussel sprouts and ham.  It was good, but I was expecting a 3-5 inch pie rather than a slice of something enormous.  The salad that came with it is best forgotten rather than eaten.  

I had a bite of someone's ruben sandwich and it was absolutely delicious.  Mm... definitely want to try that again. 

Nice place.  The bar seems to have a lot of beer variety on tap.  Good service."}
{"text":"This bar is awesome. Should have more than 3.5 stars.
Came for brunch and World Cup viewing. Lots of TVs for this which was great.
For food we had the Chorizo & eggs (Cooper's Cure) - delicious - and the bf had corned beef hash which was also very good.
The best part of the meal was the biscuit side we ordered. Yum.
The beer chaser to the bangin' Bloody Mary is a very nice touch.
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch there today -  ate at the bar.   First....atmosphere and service were great....all the bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable....drinks prices rather reasonable.  The food...while okay...was not worth the price.  Burgers ordered med-rare came out the other side of medium....and we're nothing special.   House chips are boring.  Pretzel app....the pretzels were good...but the cheese sauce...well...I've had better at dive bars with some self respect.  For a place that says they have an executive chef.....it doesn't show.  We will be back for drinks...won't bother with the food."}
{"text":"This is a great place for groups, everyone else not so much. If you have a noisy, boisterous group of people that want very good food & a wide selection of excellent micro/import beers on tap, this is your place. The wait service is a little indifferent, but if your busy talking with your party, you won't notice. I would be interested to see if it would be different in the summer when they have outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner.  The cheese curds appetizer comes with a delicious ranch dipping sauce.  There seemed to be a decent amount of vegetarian options, including a special of vegetarian shepherd's pie.  I went with the sweet potato chili, which was spicier than I expected but good (and served with some cheese, sour cream, and corn bread to cut the spice a little bit)"}
{"text":"Excellent drink selection and bar food that really takes it up a notch from what you'd normally expect. The beer-cheese pretzels, in addition to being beautifully presented, were a perfect compliment to my obscure hefeweizen from Germany. 

Their imports also went well with my $3 mini-cheeseburgers; while each one was about as big as a half-dollar, they were clearly made from very high-quality beef and cheddar, and came with an exorbitant amount of deep-fried potato chips made from scratch. 

The beet salad was honestly one of the best salads I've ever had.

I do have one warning: don't even think about the bone marrow crostini if you aren't already a fan of bone marrow. Gamiest, smelliest piece of meat I've ever even looked at. I really should have known better than to order something as adventurous as that at what's basically a high-end pub. It reeked like urine and there was nothing on the plate to offset the squishy and smooth texture of the bone marrow other than their \"crostini\" (toasted french bread). It at least could have used some spices."}
{"text":"Been to Cooper's a few times now, mostly for drinks and a couple of times for food. They have a pretty good selection of beers and booze. The space is small, so it gets pretty cramped especially on the weekends. Cell phone reception = incredibly spotty in this place, yes, the struggle is real. I like the round tables up by the front windows, nice little design touch. And the small private room in the back of the bar is also a nice cozy space for your group if you can get it.

The food is pretty good. I got the bone marrow once and it was tasty and buttery. Other people in my group got the burgers and sandwiches, all looked great. 

The most recent visit was for Sunday brunch. It was a short wait to get seated, which was not problem. I got the steak and eggs and others in my group got the eggs benedict. I wasn't asked how I wanted my steak done, but it came out just under medium, so that was fine with me. The sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste, which made everything taste heavier than it should have. The rosemary potatoes were alright. They would have been better if it were more crispy like breakfast potatoes, rather than the more dinner like roasted potatoes that I got. After all, this is brunch, not dinner. My friends both enjoyed their eggs benedict. One did mention her eggs were a little over poached, but it wasn't a huge complaint.

Overall, a decent option to keep in mind for downtown outings day or night."}
{"text":"The good was delish. The staff friendly. The host was crazy hot I mean damn. Anyway I regress. Had brunch there didn't even know it existed until a friend mentioned it. Outdoor seating. Great people watching. And an interesting menu."}
{"text":"I tried Coopers Tavern for lunch recently. It has a warm, cozy, and inviting atmosphere. My waiter greeted me quickly upon entering an ushered me to a table. The tables are a mite close together. I'm not overweight, but I did have to rotate to slide in past the next table. My waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. I perused the quite decent beer listing while waiting for my dining companion.

There was a number of interesting items on the menu. I was intrigued by the appetizers: beer cheese pretzels, belgian frites, poutine and sconnie egg. I thought about the sweet corn caesar or the brussels sprout salad. A number of the sandwiches also sounded interesting: grilled cheese w/gouda and gruyere, ham w/stout grained mustard, caramelized onions and gouda, but I settled on the turkey with apple-pear slaw and gouda. I wasn't so sure after my first bite. The slaw wasn't what I was expecting, but as I took a few more bites I definitely liked it. Crisp, crunchy, a little bit sharp. It was tasty. What was really tasty were the home-made chips which came with it. Thick, crunchy, really good. I could eat a large plate of these. Our waiter came back often to check on us. I was very pleased with the service.

I will definitely go back and try more of their menu. I like the twists they put on what originally sounds like a traditional item."}
{"text":"I'm a biased reviewer, as I know many folks who work here, including the proprietor. But I'll say this: I've never had a bad experience at The Cooper's Tavern, regardless of if folks knew that I know the proprietor. The beer selection is off the charts, and anyone interested in craft, import, and overall delicious beer will love this place. 

The view of the capitol building is second to none, especially from the second floor, which can be reserved privately.

I'd never eaten bone marrow until I experienced Cooper's, and I'll tell you, theirs is the one I will judge all others on. Its an absolutely delicious and decadent experience. You seriously need to try this.

Brunch is also an amazing meal period, due not only to the fantastic people watching on the patio on the square in the summer, but due to the fantastically executed dishes. Skip Sardine, and hit up The Cooper's. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Well, to be honest. The food is so so, they can definitely expand their menu and/or change up their menu from time to time..

However, this is a great place to grab a drink and watch a game (usually footie for me). The ambiance and clientele are nice...."}
{"text":"The Cooper's Tavern has become a signature spot I recommend to Madison visitors and natives alike. The beetroot hummus is a relatively healthy, yet totally delectable appetizer go-to, but I recently tried the Roast Beef Rockets that are served with their chipotle aioli and all I can really say is DO IT! You won't be disappointed. 

The crisped goat cheese on the already perfect Amy's salad is a \"guilty\" pleasure for which I advise you forgo the self-condemnation because they do it oh-so-right and it's oh-so-worth it."}
{"text":"Adorable place near the capital.  Tons of seating and multiple bars (two levels).  Great feel, old wood and historical looking.  We only had drinks here, but the food I saw looked really good!  Check it out, for sure!"}
{"text":"Great service, location and outdoor seating. Enjoyed a Bloody Mary, beer, sweet potato chili."}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  I had the beet hummus and a chicken sandwich.  I felt like the old lady in the Wendy's ad when I got my sandwich.  The bread was huge but the chicken was actually a serving.  I removed 3/4 of the bread and had a correctly portioned sandwich.  

Some in my party had dessert.  The Guinness cupcake looked and was reported to be tremendous."}
{"text":"I feel like I can't leave a complete review because during my trip here I only got a pretzel, but it was a really good pretzel. At first I thought it was burnt because it was quite dark in color on the outside, but it was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and pillowy on the inside. I'm not sure what the cheese sauce was, it was very mellow but tasty. 

I'd go back for brunch, I've heard good things."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.

Went here for lunch with the SO at the recommendation of a friend. We were expecting a restaurant, so we were a bit put off but the limited selection seating. There's a bar, one really long, kind of communal-like table, and a few tables tucked in back. We were seated a one of the tables in back fairly quickly, after being greeted by the bar tender and given the choice of bar or table.

We were also a little underwhelmed at the menu. The selection is pretty slim, but we decided to give it a try since we were already here. We both ordered drinks, mine was the hot chocolate which came a little stronger than I would have preferred (but that's a good complaint to have in my opinion!) and my SO had the Irish coffee (I believe his was also a little stronger than he expected). 

We had the poutine as an appetizer, and both chose a sandwich, though I don't remember what we got specifically now. I liked the poutine, my SO, who is French Canadian said it was 'passable'. Our sandwiches were the real show stopper though. So, so, good! Alongside their homemade, thick cut chips, this was one of the best meals I have had in Madison, to date.

Our server (unfortunately I forget her name) was also absolutely amazing. She had one table of about 8 - 10, and a few smaller tables including ours. She never once missed a beat. Our glasses of water were always full, she checked back a time or two while we were deciding what to order, and chatted pleasantly with us about the food. We were so impressed with her we grabbed a manager and told him what a great job she was doing. He told us she wasn't even scheduled today, she was the only person able to come in when two of the staff called in sick. She never once seemed annoyed or flustered to have her hands full on her day off.

So, despite not really being what we were expecting, we were above and beyond satisfied with our experience."}
{"text":"the soup is still amazing, the fish and chips are still amazing, and we also tried the pretzel sticks which were VERY good as well - more bready than pretzely tasting, but still very yummy.  i had the venetian manicotti which was good but reminded me of something SO familiar that i couldn't place, that i was more frustrated than anything with it.. ha."}
{"text":"This place is so-so.  The food was ok, I had the steak frites. It was about 6 slices of a small steak and just blah fries topped with a strange sweet sauce(not sure why). My partner had a vege special with chanterelle mushrooms that was really well seasoned. The bone marrow app was under seasoned and just blah again. I found the service super slow and the place too loud for my tastes. Overall, Brasserie V is way, way better!  Rather spend my money there."}
{"text":"We have been eating a Cooper's ever since opened.  Although I am not a fan of Food Fight. Group, this restaurant is the one exception to the usual mediocrity of FF.  My favorite salad is the Amy's with the Sweet Corn Ceasar  a close second.  The Veggie sandwich is the best in town.  British  Chicken Curry is amazing, the grilled cheese sandwich with a shot of tomato soup for dipping is great.  The beer is always cold and a great selection.  Cooper's is a perfect pub experience."}
{"text":"I went for a quick after-work drink and a small bite to eat. I was amused when the waiter placed the menus in front of me: a 1-page food menu and a book-menu with the alcohol selections. The order of fries I got ($3.50) was huge, so was a great value, and they tasted great! I also got a Fat Tire which, at $5, was a little pricier than I'm used to, but I also need to blame myself a little because for that same price, I could've gotten a far more unique drink.

I'd say it's a pretty sure thing I'll be back there before I leave this town."}
{"text":"I've eaten at The Cooper's Tavern many times in the past couple of years... I've definitely noticed a decline in the level of service. My husband and I ate here this evening at the bar. The bar staff ignored us for most of the evening. We had to flag staff down to ask for waters on two separate occasions. After my husband finished his beer, he waited at least half an hour to get a water. 

The food definitely isn't good enough to make up for the poor service. It wasn't busy-- one of the bartenders even had time to pull their phone out and text for a few minutes."}
{"text":"Service was slow and had an attitude from the start. Mixed cocktails were bad. I've had plenty of mixed drinks in my lifetime and these were horrible. We had to return the drinks twice and then got attitude from management stating that the drinks were made correctly and it was us who were wrong. We had the specials and the food was good. Steak was tender and had good flavor. We ordered the baked brie before we finished our meal and it never arrived. We finally gave up and got more attitude when we asked for the check so we could leave. They didn't tell us the Brie took about 20 minutes to cook when we ordered it, however, it was over 20 minutes and it was no where to be found. Very frustrated with the poor service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and fantastic selection of craft beers!"}
{"text":"I went while I was traveling for work with a bunch of co-workers. We ended up buying 6 different meals so we could do family style and get a little bit of each. The place is really loud and busy, which can be expected for a pub type restaurant. I had some hard cider that was really good. The food was ok; I really liked the pretzel chicken and the cooper's burger. The chicken sandwich with chipotle sauce was pretty dry and flavorless. I tried a bite of my friends macaroni with lobster and was not a huge fan...neither was he :(  The burger sliders were pretty good along with the steak frites and the pork chop. The server was courteous and she even spilt our bill for us which I know is a huge pain in the a$$. With the number of great restaurants in the area, I think I would try something different if I were to visit there again."}
{"text":"So everybody seems to love this place.  I don't get it.  The food is meh.  The service is terrible.  Went with a friend for lunch and drinks and got an underdressed Caesar salad with overcooked salmon.  The waiter let us know that serving two women was beneath him in that \"I'd rather be elsewhere\" way.  Why, why why, (with the exception of the amazing Monty's) can't food fight provide decent service?  As a proud former waitron, I'm constantly appalled by the non-Monty's servers.  And, yeah, the food is Meh.  I mean, it's cool to eat on the square.  I work there.  I like it.  But there are SO many better places!"}
{"text":"Man oh man did i want to give coopers tavern 5 stars!! But, I've been there three times and each time my experiences has gotten a little worse. The service got worse and unfortunately the food just wasn't as great the first time, but I still recommend this place for a go to spot in Madison. So here's my two cents on the food as long as you're prepared for a wait at the door and hit or miss service...and i guess food in some instances.

First--get the beer cheese pretzel. you will not regret it. Their beer cheese dip has to be my absolute favorite ever. Now, i say that because the first two times i got it, it was heaven. Hot, ridiculously flavorful and gooey cheese with the perfectly salted pretzel, i have been to heaven twice with this app. however, the third time ordering it the cheese was a little colder and given to me in a plastic side dish rather than their insulated (or more insulated) glass. But anyways, just make sure you order the beer cheese rather than the mustard and you'll be good. 

I have also gotten the pork belly piggy mac twice and not regretted it a bit. I will say it is not the best pork belly by any means, but it is a hefty portion and the cheese mixture that they use is so good, my friends that came with me were raving about it the next day. one of them even had leftovers and couldn't wait to eat it the next day, which fun fact! If you can't finish the piggy mac, eat it the next day as leftovers and it's going to be just as good. 

Lastly, the grilled cheese, corn Caesar salad, and frites are all good. not super exceptional...maybe the grilled cheese because they have goat cheese and i'm a sucker for that, but everything else is good. As aforementioned the service is hit or miss, so hope that you get a good server and that the food comes out hot and you'll be a happy camper.

til then, happy eating!"}
{"text":"4 Stars for the Beer Options.  I only stopped at this place briefly, but the beer choices were some of the best I've seen.  Not your typical bar."}
{"text":"We went to Coopers on Saturday because the go-to burger and fries place we had tried first is by the Kohl Center.  There was a game and it was wall to wall in there.

We ended up having a better burger, better fries and great beer at Cooper's.

We split the Cooper's burger which was just right for the two of us.  (My wife is a pretty light eater.)  The burger came with red onions, pork belly, pickles, and lettuce.  The bun was just right and meat was cooked perfectly.  The fries were plentiful and perfectly crisp on the outside, moist in the middle.  The aioli is tangy and light.

Cooper's Tavern hit the spot just right for a Saturday burger lunch."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a long time, so my wife and I tried it out for Food Fight Foodie Week and an early Valentine's dinner (to avoid the crowd). The menu was appealing. We both ordered the French onion soup, which had a bit of a kick but still good. The salmon en croute was unexpectedly tasty. My wife really enjoyed the braised ribs she got. She said it was tender, but could have been even more. The dessert options were good - I ordered the apple cobbler with ice cream and she had the chocolate torte. She thought her dessert was too rich, but still ate 90% of it. We were unexpectedly happy with our food. Thinking of trying them for lunch sometime."}
{"text":"I like this place for its brunch menu more than its pub scene. It's one of the better ones I've seen. 

I'm a fan of Cooper's Tavern's eggs benedict, salmon crepe, quiche, and banana bread french toast. I'm positive the other items on their brunch menu are great as well, but I haven't tried them all. Their poutine is pretty legit and the bloody mary definitely helps jump start the day.

Don't hesitate; drop by for brunch instead of the usual."}
{"text":"Nothing here wowed me. Large beer select, but so do many other bars on or near the square. 

A travel channel series advertised this place, and made a special reference to their pork belly mac & cheese.  The pork was too crispy (teetering on a chicharrón texture) and the cheese was too creamy. Just not for me.

Fish Friday is huge in Madison. I will try next time."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the Coop(yep, so good that we have a nickname)! The cheese curds... Normally I think they are all the same, but there's truly stand out. I recommend anything really, but I tried the Caesar with salmon, and it was abundant with ingredients and prepared nicely."}
{"text":"We went to Coopers for dinner. It is by the Capitol, street parking available. We were fortunate and did not have to wait for a table. 

Our server was professional and helpful. 

I had the New Glarus Belgian Red. It was good. 

We shared beer cheese pretzels, which were okay and the croquettes which were amazing. I had the chicken sandwich and it was very good, served hot with chips.

Very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food is decent for the price, friendly bartenders. I went with one other person for dinner and sat at the bar. Service was quick and friendly and they were sure to ask appropriate questions. We split a burger with fries and cheese curds. Burger was a bit dry (I'd suggest an order of medium) but not bad. The cheese curds were great and would recommend you request the malt vinegar aioli to dip."}
{"text":"This place is for the beer connoiseur. By far, the best beer selection in Madison. Great atmosphere, great owner, great place."}
{"text":"What a great experience!  Our group of 50 people, in town for a corporate sales dinner, was displaced after another local restaurant \"forgot\" about our reservation.  We were welcomed without hesitation and the staff made us feel at home and they took great care of us.  Their upstairs room is awesome and everyone enjoyed their meals.  What could have been a big bust of a night was saved by the friendly staff, yummy food and great atmosphere at The Coopers Tavern!"}
{"text":"If Coopers wasn't on the Capitol square, no one would go to it. This is the most overrated place in town. I've been several times and every time it's packed and the food is mediocre. Don't expect to be able to have a conversation with just your dining companion(s) because the tables are so close to each other you're all practically eating together. I think we're supposed to think that's charming. I just find it irritating. We went last week before a show at the Overture. My brisket sandwich was dry and over-cooked and The Boyfriend's pork chop was similarly dry and overdone. What a bummer. Good beer selection and the Belgian frites were ok (though under-salted and putting aoli in a shot glass is not really attractive...), but we won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"After exploring downtown Madison a bit, my family got the munchies so we decided to stop in! The interior is so cute and I loved it! Very welcoming and gives off UKesque vibes. Since it is located right near the capitol, the views are gorgeous. 

Our waitress was very attentive and made sure that we were satisfied throughout the whole meal. My mom ordered a beer flight from a recommendation and it was really good. All of the beers were different which made it fun to taste all of them.

For food, we ordered: cheese curds, fries, tomato and red pepper soup and a big soft pretzel. The cheese curds were beer battered and so yummy. I tried to get them wherever we went because of Wisconsin but these stood out in my mind as some of the best! They came with a ranch that was homemade and very delicious. The fries were also good and they were served with some aioli that was tasty! I was really excited for the soup but it had a really strange taste so I was not a huge fan. Finally, the pretzel which was really good. It was served warm with a mustard sauce and a cheese sauce. Personally, I was not a fan of the mustard but the cheese sauce was great! 

All in all, Cooper's Tavern is a fun place to stop in for some drinks and appetizers. It has a nice atmosphere, good views, and an attentive waitstaff."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this restaurant after walking in the cold on our way to a different restaurant- and as luck would have it the food was pretty good! My friend and I shared the poutine. The only critique I have would be more gravy please! And maybe an option to add meat? My grilled cheese and house made potato chips were pretty good and I would recommend ordering- the cheese was melty and the bread was buttery- just how you want your grilled cheese. The restaurant seemed to have a pretty great location- but as a tourist, I wouldn't know much about that. The next time I'm in town, I'll make this spot an intentional visit instead of an accidental one!"}
{"text":"I'll preface this review by stating that I was here with a large group and I understand how those can be a challenge for a restaurant. Still, it never ceases to amaze me how restaurants can understaff when they know well in advance that they have a large party coming. There must've been at least 50 patrons in the upstairs room and the restaurant only had two servers for the entire group. To put it in perspective, we arrived at 7 PM and started ordering from the limited menu chosen by the restaraunt. It was 9:15 PM before we finally received our entrées. Everyone in our party was so ready to leave, that we simply skipped dessert.

The waitstaff, who were obviously overwhelmed, were simply just blah. Maybe they figured they had their mandatory tip for large parties sewed up and no extra effort was necessary.

As far as the food goes, well it was average at best. There was not one item on the preselected menu that I found appetizing. I pleaded with my waitress to let me just get a hamburger and she refused. Honestly, I should've gotten up and walked downstairs and ordered a hamburger 

Avoid this place unless mediocrity is what you seek."}
{"text":"What a great find!  In town on business and a friend recommended this place for the cheese curds. What she failed to mention was the fun view of the Capitol building and the great people watching. The food is delicious. Yes, the cheese curds are good. So is the sweet potato chili and the spinach salad (add the salmon for perfection). The homemade chips are crispy, crunchy, and perfectly salted. My collage had the burger and loved it as well!  Service was friendly without being pushy and very attentive. I highly recommend this place for a casual, yummy dinner or just cheese curds and a beer."}
{"text":"Woah this place was cool.  You only need to know one thing about it, they serve poutine!  And beer!  Poutine is a Canadian thing but I'm surprised it hadn't made it's way to Wisconsin yet.  It's basically french fries with cheese curds topped with gravy.  It sounds simple but it's fucking excellent.  Oh and the Brisket was rad as well.  5 Stars to Cooper's."}
{"text":"Awesome food and atmosphere.  The owner Peter is a gracious host. The menu is interesting and the service is outstanding.  The food was perfectly prepared and delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch with our child a few weeks back - even on a Wednesday it was super busy and cramped. They did offer high chairs but it definitely was a tight space with our kid, that's okay - just noted. I ordered their burger and it was great. The grilled cheese (that my husband ordered) was a major miss - the sandwich was WAY too creamy....I felt so bad for him we split my burger. I have been here before and enjoyed it and will stop again - just probably sans kid and ordering something different."}
{"text":"Cooper's Tavern is top-notch!!

The beer selection is plentiful and our server knew about many of them, and was able to point us both in the right direction.

The place was busy and continued to get busier while we were seated, however the service remained spot on. Loved the decor, the ceiling fans, the hardwood floors, the old time saloon feel!

Though the pretzels are really nothing to \"rave\" about the Cooper's Burger more than made up for it. The pork belly added a little pop to the burger. My \"better half\" had a salad and a veggie chilli which were both very good as well. 

I love a place that has options for both of us and this is one of them.

Keep up the good work Cooper's (but get rid of the pretzel stick things)!"}
{"text":"Stopped by before heading to a performance at the Overture Center. We knew it would be busy on a Saturday night and since we had 7 people we got there early; we were promptly seated and our waitress gave great suggestions as several us had never been. All around the food was good, mussels, steak, variety of salads and sandwiches. Overall a nice place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, above average cocktails, good atmosphere, but the food could use some work. I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately the moules frites they served were among the worst I've ever had and this is not a dish you can mess up easily. But in this case it was decent mussels and OK fries drowned in an awful lemon soup that had enough wine in it to impart an odd alcoholic flavor. What's worse is the fries and bread arrived in this soup rendering them a bit soggy. 

But there's hope! The beer and drinks are above average for Madison so as long as your primary motivation is to drink your dinner you're in luck. 

Bartenders and staff are also excellent."}
{"text":"Visited on Saturday night, so the place was hopping. The wait wasn't bad at all for that time of night, and they had a bar upstairs where we could order drinks and an appetizer while we waited. The Poutine was yummy! Unfortunately, the Pork Belly Mac was a bit bland. They do have a very extensive wine and beer list. Our service that night was friendly, but somewhat slow. After waiting for half an hour for a table, it was another 10 before we even got a menu. Overall, it was good enough that I would go again, but not amazing."}
{"text":"Service was \"eh\" here.  First time here and probably won't be going back anytime soon. We decided to order dessert here and it wasn't the best. Didn't finish it and that's all I have to say about that."}
{"text":"Love the brunch here! I've had the steak and the eggs Benedict before. Both are amazing!. This place is especially awesome in the summer when you can eat outside m!"}
{"text":"Good and consistent. A little small, so it's hard to get a seat on the weekends. 

They have very flavorful fish and chips."}
{"text":"Excellent~  good beer selection. I had the Veggie sandwich: roasted zucchini, red peppers, carrots and portobello mushrooms on wheatberry bread with hummus, feta, and oven-dried tomatoes...comes with chips or salad. LOVED it!  

Only downfall is on a busy night where some folks are just there to drink, the setup of tables and standing room makes it difficult to navigate through.   

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Casual place, we went for lunch with another couple. We were touring around the area, the capital, and college. It's a favorite with locals so it was pretty crowded and noisy, but we got a table quickly. Main reason we went there was for the beer selection, since the guy we were with makes his own beer and wanted to try something special. 

My husband got the Ruben, with corned beef, and was very happy. I had the Sweet Potato Chili, on the recommendation of the waiter, and it was the best chili! Don't be frightened by the sweet potato ingredient! It looked like diced carrots but added a nice sweetness to the dish. Delicious!

The other couple had sandwiches and salads and were equally happy with their meals. All in all, I would recommend this place for lunch!"}
{"text":"I was very happy with this place after picking up the wife from the airport and the Old Fashioned was booked for an hour or more. This place was recommended by one of the hosts of Harvest which is right next to the Old Fashioned, We didn't go because it was a little too upscale for coming from the airport. This place was great, the waiter/server gave us good insights on the popular items. Do not pass up the frenched chicken. Yeah it's a chicken dish and it's worth ordering. My wife ordered the chicken and I order the pork belly mac, pretty awesome, you need that mac to cut through the richness of the pork belly. I was up north in Wisconsin past spring green earlier that week and I recognized a few of the farms and creameries they source ingredients from because I had a chance to visit and buy some stuff from them. One of the managers was very friendly and checked on us a couple times and even stopped to have a conversation with us about moving out to the country and how he someone will get dragged up there with his boyfriend. Paraphrasing of course... Anyways.. I recommend visiting when you are in the square. Btw they have cool ceiling fans."}
{"text":"We went on a Monday evening and enjoyed a good Irish dinner and excellent music provided by a traditional Irish band.  It was interesting that the band was actually sitting at the back of the restaurant while performing...and, of course, drinks conveniently on the table in front of them.  Some of the pubs in Ireland are laid back and casual just like this and it brought back great memories of our pub experience in Dublin."}
{"text":"I'm glad I came back here. Had a friend from Wales and my father in law with me and felt like getting some grub downtown. Old Fashioned had 45 minute wait on a Tuesday evening. NO THANKS. So I told them about Coopers, we were welcomed into the nicely air conditioned environment of Coopers with the cool ceiling fans. We were seated instantly. 

We started off with 2 Guinness Beer's and 1 Stella for myself. We had the \"Beer Cheese Pretzels.\" They only give you three pretzel sticks so be aware of that. The cheese was delish! We moved on to the entrees, I had the Pretzel Crusted Chicken, I'll spare you the details. IT WAS FANTASTIC! My Walsh friend had the Icelandic Haddock and stated that it was \"Superb\" or some fancy English word that they speak... My father in law had the pork chop and wasn't all that impressed. He really wanted mussels, however they sold out. Overall we enjoyed our entrees minus the pork chop.


I will be back. Coopers has improved, service was great!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service and menu.  Fish and chips were so tasty!  There always seems to be a wait, understandably so, because it's worth it."}
{"text":"The food was really good here.  We had a couple of salads, soup, their pretzel and fish and chips.  Our waiter was friendly and was attentive throughout us receiving our food.  He seemed to get slammed with multiple new tables around the time we were ready for our bill and to go box then it took awhile. The restaurant was nice looking, a bit loud but that was due to the space I am guessing and maybe because we had a couple loud groups by us. 

We will go back though."}
{"text":"Hubs & I strolled in one chilly day hoping to enjoy a quick early lunch in the sunshine. The place was completely EMPTY. The only other people here were staff members. We asked if we could sit in the sun (because I was cold). The minute the host sat us by the sunny window, the bartender immediately told us to move.

\"I need those seats for my other customers.\"

I looked around the restaurant. There was literally NOBODY ELSE THERE. I've worked in a restaurant so I totally get it about not wasting a 5-top on 2 people. But it was COMPLETELY EMPTY! I pointed this out, that we were his only customers. I thought the bartender was making an attempt at humor. Nope! He was serious! He insisted, \"You need to move unless you're going to finish your meal in 20 minutes or less.\" We actually WERE looking to have a quick meal, but after being addressed as nothing but commodities to him, there was no way in hell I was sticking around to give them my money. Little did this jerkface know that when hubs and I go out, we usually order drinks, apps, booze, you name it, along with taking a dessert to go. We could've easily dropped a quick $70 for our \"quick lunch.\" But we were treated so horribly and there are SO MANY OTHER RESTAURANTS IN MADISON that want our money. Cooper's Tavern will never get a thin dime from us.

We literally walked fifteen feet down the sidewalk and had a wondrous dining experience at Field Table. And when we were done eating, we walked past Cooper's Tavern. I looked inside. Not A SINGLE MOFO? was in there!!!

When you treat your customers like that, it's no wonder why! That bartender can sit & spin."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this establishment.  It is a small unassuming restaurant. 

It is so delicious.  I had the Tuscan salad and it was just amazing.  The basil pesto and the roasted red peppers made this meal stand out as more than a mere salad.  I can only overuse the word amazing because there is no other word to describe the delicious food.  

They have a traditional french-canadian dish called poutine.  It is fries with cheese curds and brown gravy.  It was absolutely delicious.  We were fortunate enough to go and get the special booth.  It is a small room for 6 with a private window directly to the bartender.

The prices are more than fair for their food and their beverages.  Many people are bothered by the beer prices, however this is typical in downtown Madison outside of happy hours.  

They have enough variety to make everyone happy."}
{"text":"Cooper's is my favourite Madison pub by far,
With great food and drink at their long wooden bar,
They show all of the Liverpool games,
Know all of their regulars names,
And are fully deserving of their fifth pointy star!"}
{"text":"Pros: Great big beer selection, really nice servers, attempt at a true Irish Pub feeling.  Great location on the square, with nice outdoor dining. The menu is a big hit for many, but not me.

Cons: It is hard to get a table, it is extremely loud, and the eclectic meal combinations do not always work.  

I've been to Coopers a half dozen times, and always want to like it more.  I find the food is not what I thought I was ordering, and I am jammed into a small space at I table I've waited for too long to be seated at.  I will give it another try."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Beet salad is amazing! Poutine is also great, you know, if you are into that cheesy, gravy covered goodness. One of the best beer menus in Madison. Staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The brunch here did not do it for me. Everything felt heavy Heavy HEAVY. The English Muffin was a sponge. The eggs were dense. And my side of fruit was served on the plate with the hot components making for hot mushy strawberries. I feel like you need to be super hung over for this. On the plus side, we had a nice server and full cups of coffee at all times. I'd give this place another try for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Very good food!! Belgian frites and malt vinegar aioli!!! YUM!!!! Sconnie eggs-terrific!!!  Pork belly Mac-good but didn't need the pork belly, didn't make sense with the dish. Leaving happy and very full!!!!!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot about the place from the local people and were real excited to try it out. 

for appetizer, we ordered the sconnie egg. The meat was dry and quite honestly it is tasteless. They tried to add flavor by putting a lot of the mustard source on the bottom but it is too salty. I think it would have worked better with a different kind of mustard. We had the Poutine as well. This is a dish that is gaining its popularity here in the US. The fries and gravy are good but the cheese are sticking together but overall it is a B+.

As for dinner we ordered the hamburger. The meat was tough. Hands down The Old Fashion is a lot better. The up side there are a big selection of beer and it is a cool place just to hang out for a pint or two with no food please."}
{"text":"Matilda on tap. Hennepin on tap. Beer cheese and pretzels and pouitine were phenomenal. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Love, love, love.....  Cody, Tyler and Michael are wonderful bartenders and good people."}
{"text":"I rarely finish a full meal but I ate every last crumb of my fried chicken sandwich lunch at this place. I LOVED the salad as well. Everything was excellent and I enjoyed the outdoor bench seating -- great for a large group. I'm still thinking about that sandwich to this day! The Green Goddess dressing was AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food and beer. If you like steak, try the steak frites. It is wonderful. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and have never been disappointed.  We almost always order the poutine as it is delicious.  Recently I had the polenta dish and while I did enjoy it the broccoli rabe was cumbersome to eat.   Otherwise everything about the dish was very good.  My co-diners had the turkey sandwich and the flank steak special.  Both meals were very good according to them.  The fried haddock is fabulous and the house made tartar sauce makes the dish.  Other friends have raved about the pork schnitzel.  The beer list is a mile long along with having wine and spirits.  It is a great casual place to eat.  Service has always been top notch.  The only problem is the entry is a bit awkward and if you have to wait for a table, there is no good place to do so if the bar is full."}
{"text":"Service and cocktails were great.  The kitchen however really did a terrible job.  A burger ordered medium rare came out very well done.  My Reuben was so burnt it came out black.  This leaves me wondering who was expo'ing the food and how they still work there."}
{"text":"While visiting Madison for a trade show recently, my colleagues and I  wandered into The Cooper's Tavern to escape the rain. Madison is a great beer city - I was really pleasantly surprised - and Cooper's Tavern represents. They've got a fantastic on tap menu as well as a great bottled selection, so there was definitely something for everyone.

I ordered the pork belly mac n cheese. Oh my god the deliciousness. In fact, I texted my compatriot Chef Lucy to ooh and goo over the taste. The sweetness of the pork belly was perfectly complimented by the sharp white Wisconsin cheddar and I loved it.

My dinner companions also enjoyed their meals (though I can't recall for the life of me what they ordered). It was pouring outside so we elected to stay in the warm cozy restaurant for dessert and shared the Guinness chocolate cake - another solid choice. 

The crowd was mixed but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and I'll for sure go back if I find myself in Madison again."}
{"text":"This is great little pub! We live right down the street and it is our go to spot.  I have have had a bunch of different things on the menu.  In the summer my favorite is the roasted sweet corn ceasar salad.  My fiance loves the ruben.  The turkey sandwhich is really good too - I think it is perfect as is, but my fiance thinks it's a little dry so he adds mayo.  

I love the atmosphere the most, it's cozy in the winter and has plenty of outside seating right on the square for summer. We always get great service and the food is great, we get it to-go on weeknights sometimes too!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try coops, many of my work friends had tried it and had nothing but good things to say. With that in mind I went in with rather high expectations.

I ordered the Salmon Lox brunch, which consists of chive eggs (A+), and salmon with some bread. The salmon is where my experience kinda fell through, I'm no fish conissour or expert but everywhere I've ordered salmon smoked or grilled it's been served warm, this salmon came to me cold as I'm sure was the chefs intention but nowhere or the menu nor did the waiter state it would be cold, this was a big letdown. The portion size was also small given little slivers of salmon but that wasn't a surprise consider it was only $10

The waiters were attentive and friendly. Despite this mediocre experience I'm optimistic that the place has more to offer and can redeem itself."}
{"text":"I've been to Cooper's a lot and have always been happy! I came here for brunch and had the daily quiche - glazed carrots, arugula, and feta. It was delicious! We got to sit in the private room in the back that is connected to the bar, which is my favorite place to sit. The waiter takes your order and gives you your food through a window from the bar. The room is very intimate and quiet, which is great for groups of 5-8 people. 

I've also been here for dinner a few times, and loved it every time. The food is very affordable for the quality, and the location is really convenient. They also have a huge selection of beers and wines.

If you come at night on a weekend, they open the upstairs room, which is another bar area. I came here with a big group, and there was a large table that could fit all of us. I love coming here, and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Ok food, not so good service, great beer selection.

I had some pretty good mussels and some severely under salted hummus and pickled vegetable appetizer. The mussels came in a tomato broth that tasted very close to Bloody Mary. And this is a good thing for me. The dips of the appetizers were basically un salted. Now it's not like I like salty stuff, but a touch of salt goes a long way to bring out flavor.

The service was rather efficient in a let's get you out of here ASAP. They did not even ask if we wanted something else before bringing the bill! And they asked about credit card before we could even take it out.
Plus they took the signed check before we left. Not a classy move.

Anyway good place for a beer and a quick bite."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in Madison - loved that the bread is more of a brioche than a bun.  Service was friendly and prompt.  My only wish is that they turned the volume on the tvs down a bit.  Yes, they're showing European football matches, so it's better than your average bar, but a little less volume would go a long way."}
{"text":"Any time we are in Madison we make a stop here. 
Great modernized comfort/pub food. Always a treat!"}
{"text":"We came here for an anniversary dinner with friends before a show at the Overture.  This was the second time we had been here, and thought it would be a good place to go with our friends.  We started out with the poutine, which was very good.  For the main, I chose the sweet corn Caesar salad, which sounded amazing.  Unfortunately, this was not the case.  The corn relish was seemingly non-existent.  Corn was in the salad, but it didn't really seem like it was part of a relish.  The dressing was a poblano-caesar dressing, but I couldn't taste the poblano.  Overall, this was just a mediocre salad.  My wife and a friend each had the turkey sandwich.  They were impressed with the actual slices of turkey breast, and thought the sandwich was good.  Our friend's husband had the Reuben sandwich.  When the server set it on the table, I was surprised to see how dark the rye was, although the description did say it was a black rye.  The description was correct, but the blackness was due to it being burnt.  How this got past anyone as being acceptable to serve is beyond me.  The server said that it would be taken off the bill.  I think this place is OK if you are going for happy hour, because they do have a pretty good beer list and good appetizers.  However, I don't think we'll go here again.  There are much better choices in Madison and on the square.

Edit:  they didn't take the sandwich off the bill, just the one beer that he drank.  Again, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, come for the beer and the soccer. Food is slightly above average but nothing that would make me come back just for that. Beer selection is great. Taps rotate frequently and I'm often surprised by the selection. I find myself here mostly due to soccer. Cooper's is the official bar for the local Arsenal fan club and I have a friend who is a huge Arsenal fan so will join him to watch games. They even open early, I'm talking 6:00 am early, for certain games. The kitchen doesn't open until 9 but the bar is open and they usually provide free coffee and bagels during that time. Very nice touch. They will also show major games such as Barcelona vs Real Madrid on a big screen in the room upstairs. The manager is a huge rugby fan so those games are occasionally on as well. It can make for a rowdy crowd when the two are on at the same time but that's part of the fun :)"}
{"text":"I will start by saying there is much to like about this restaurant from a location and aesthetics standpoint.  It really drew us in.  The night we ate there, it was really busy and we sat outside with a view of the capitol.  We were kind of forgotton about and had to wait a really long time for all of our food.  I am gluten free and this is the main reason I am writing this review.  I find reviews of how restaurants handle those who eat this way, for whatever reason, so helpful.  This restaurant has a GF menu (I have celiac) which was a huge bonus.  However my soup which I ordered off the GF menu came out with a huge slice of sourdough laying on the soup spoon.  Not a huge deal to get another spoon but made me nervous as to how aware they really were.  Then the wait for our entrees took so long I had to leave with my 2 year old daughter because she had run out of patience.  I am sure it is great on less busy nights, but we weren't able to enjoy the experience that night."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at the Cooper's Tavern, for the most part. It was completely full -- I took the only remaining seat at the bar. It didn't really stand out as a place I'm dying to go back to, but the food was pretty good and the service was pretty decent.  I had the Cooper Burger, which had great flavor.  The cocktails were ok... I tried to order one a little less sweet, and the bartender just didn't seem to understand why I would want that, and didn't make it as ordered.  So I ended up having to just switch to beer to play it safe. I'd certainly consider returning sometime for the burger, and hopefully it will be a little less busy and a little more personal."}
{"text":"Tonight, I was down on state street and I googled \"reuben sandwich Madison, WI.\" What came up first? The Cooper's Tavern. And let me tell you, the divine direction of the Google gods did not disappoint this girl. 

I ordered the reuben sandwich with Belgian frites on the side and magner's apple cider on tap.  The reuben is as good as they say. The flavors of corned beef, swiss, sauerkraut, and dressing blend to perfectly proportioned perfection. It's mellow, smokey, heaven on toasted rye bread.

 Here's the clincher: the sauerkraut is marinated in scotch. That's what sets the flavors over the top. 

I don't think I'll order the Magner's again. Just not a fan.

On ambiance: it's long, narrow, warmly lit with candles. Everyone is seated close together. Due to the sandwich being so yummy, I'm sufficiently distracted from the guy at the bar yelling like a caveman at the Reds game."}
{"text":"We were in Madison to visit my daughter and enjoyed her recommendations on where to go.
We had some sliders (called Wee Burgers) for appetizers.
Beers were good.
My bf enjoyed chicken breast soaked in beer brine, encrusted in pretzel with cream mustard sauce, with brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes.  
My daughter enjoyed the Mussels. 
I ordered the Boston Wedge Salad with chicken which was very fresh and cool. I loved the pumpkin seeds and pickled grapes.. A really great touch.
BF had the chocolate tart with sea salt and bourbon glaze.
We had a lovely evening watching people on the sidewalk, across from the Capitol and just relaxing together on the last night of our visit.
The staff were friendly and informative and on the ball.
A perfect spot to represent Madison's great cafe atmosphere in summer."}
{"text":"I swear to god...one of these days, Yelp will give us the option for half-stars. Until then, it's going to be three for me (whereas it would've been 3.5). 

I like Cooper's. Really, I do. The food is pretty solid, and so is the beer selection. The problem? Well, it's overpriced. A lot of their beers run $5+, and while that's a bargain price in DC or NY, this is Madison, and I don't expect to pay that much. Even their specialty selection, which usually has a sour or two, is way too much. The selection is good overall, but if I want to really go all out, I'll head over to Maduro or out east to The Malthouse. 

Now, the food? Well, as with most Food Fight places, it's hit or miss. Stealthily delicious hummus platter (I think it's beet hummus, but not sure), so-so sliders and so-so poutine (pronounced \"Putin\", believe it or not). 

Cooper's has a really cool atmosphere, but the meh quality of the food and pricey beer list is keeping me from giving it more than 3 stars. Would I hang out there? Absolutely, as long as I didn't plan on drinking a lot."}
{"text":"Very good bar with a good beer selection and better than average food.

The fish fry was excellent, featuring three large pieces of haddock, plenty of fries, malt vinegar, and a shot glass of tartar. The coleslaw was subaverage and boring. Brussels sprouts salad was a surprise standout, with real bacon bits, a lightly applied but heavy cream sauce, and excellent blue cheese. The sprouts were served cold but perfectly cooked. Croutons were inexplicably bland--they were little more than over toasted bread with no seasoning. But the salad itself was good. Poutine is decent; it's all well executed local ingredients but tastes nothing like the rendition I had in Montreal. Not sure where it's off, perhaps the gravy. It's still decadent and tasty, if not authentic.

During peak hours they cram people in a bit too closely for my taste. You're practically on top of your neighbor here. In off hours this is a comfortable place to eat and have a drink, and the bar stools are surprisingly comfortable as well."}
{"text":"Overall: Great place to hang out for a casual lunch or dinner with drinks.

The good: Food tasted great with good portion sizes. Plenty of options to choose from.The beer list is extensive. Plenty of seating both inside and out. The service was very nice and helpful. The atmosphere was great as well. 

The bad: Food was overpriced. Delicious but expensive for dinner. 

Atmosphere: 9/10
Service: 9/10
Food: 8/10"}
{"text":"I was really excited when the Coopers Tavern opened, but after a few visits, I'm a touch underwhelmed. However, they still have fairly good food and beers at a convenient location (with a beautiful view of the Capitol, I might add), so while I don't crave it, I'll probably return for beers and a bit every now and then.

The interior is really small, crowded, and loud. I purposely avoid the place when they have live Irish music because it's completely deafening and makes it impossible to talk to anyone. There's often a line on busy nights, and there isn't much room inside for it to grow, so I avoid it more during the winter. In the spring and summer, there's a large, pleasant outdoor patio, which is a significantly more enjoyable area to have a meal and drinks. The bathrooms are clean and well-stocked. If you're going with a group of friends, see if you can use the snug; it's like a tiny bar-within-a-bar that's walled-in and much quieter with seating for up to about 8 people. There's a tiny window that opens onto the bar, making it really easy to place drink orders with a bartender. It's a much more pleasant experience. I notice that their website says they've opened up the second floor Thursday-Saturday 4:30-midnight when there isn't a private event, so maybe this will help with the crowding and noise issues.

The staff is friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about the menu. They're prompt and attentive, and make sure to check that you're enjoying your food and drinks. Nothing but kudos all around for those guys.

The tap beer list is seasonally rotated and extensive; it's full of great beers from local microbreweries as well as some other not-so-local yet delicious beers. The bottle beer list is as long as my arm and full of some fantastic choices. I haven't had wine or mixed drinks here, though; the beer selection is always too tempting to pass up. The food is really hit-or-miss. The Belgian frites with malt vinegar aioli are crispy and hot with a good hit of salt, and the aioli is a perfect compliment of acidity with a smooth edge. The poutine, although very salty, is a great winter dish, but far too heavy for a summer evening. The roasted bone marrow is extremely rich. The overriding taste is just pure fattiness. I like fat as much as the next person, but I had to ask for more bread because it's difficult to eat in large quantities at once. It works better as a shared dish. The mussels du jour are a crap shoot, since they are prepared differently every day. I steer clear of the days when they're steamed in beer (especially Guinness), because they taste extremely sour to me. They used to also have a chips and chicken curry plate, which I loved, but it seems to have been taken off the menu.

Overall, if I'm in the area and it isn't too busy, it's worth the occasional stop, but with so many other good restaurants in the vicinity, it's definitely not an overriding favorite."}
{"text":"Good service. Fresh food, local ingredients. Vegan options. Seems like a great (if busy) brunch spot."}
{"text":"Good overall atmosphere. Not too loud, but enough where it was lively and you're not shouting at each other.

 I literally just had one glass of Moscato wine the whole 2 hours I was there, but it was a damn good one. Service was great, even though our table just had drinks and fries. We weren't ignored like some would typically, especially since we weren't ordering full meals. 

Definitely coming back to try the menu."}
{"text":"The best rueben I've ever had so far. Beer selection was good and the crowd was lively."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  However the service was a little disappointing.  On each visit there was a hiccup with either the food being brought out on a timely manner (e.g. appetizers should come out before the meal) or some confusion on the items actually ordered.  Nonetheless I would recommend this place.  Last warning, the space could prove a slight clusterphobic during peak hours.  Great beer selection."}
{"text":"Okay, I feel guilty for giving this place only two stars because it seems like a four star place on paper but.........

So the menu is great, but the food quality is very inconsistent.  I have tried  almost half the menu and have ordered the same item (brisket sandwich for one) on different occasions and had very different results!!  The pretzels and cheese are a decent app.  The fish fry is solid.  As for everything else well, ehhhh.

The wait staff is always very friendly, but the knowledge of the menu and the beer list is not where it should be.  The menu isn't that complicated and at times the staff doesn't seem to have a very in-depth knowledge of the items.

The shotgun style lay-out isn't great for large groups, but if it's just you and a few buddies, this is a great place to go and tip a few.

Hopefully as they become more established, the consistency will come and this place will turn into a madison staple!  It has the potential!!"}
{"text":"Not sure about this place.  Not the best service.  I understand not wanting people, who aren't eating, to use up your tables when busy.  But when 3/4 of the place is empty - don't make it a point, when we come in, to tell us to sit at the bar.   

Though the drinks were great, it took a bit too long for the bartenders to notice us.  You would think that sitting behind the beer pulls would show that we are REALLY into beer..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants downtown near the square. The place is usually really busy downstairs, but there's almost alwasy room in the new upstairs, but beware that the menu up there is limited!
Great beer selection and they make a good old fashion. The food is constantly good and fresh! It can be a little spendy for casual dining, but the dishes are fresh, local and you are right downtown with views of the capitol."}
{"text":"This place has a cool vibe both inside and out, a tremendous draft and bottle list, and savory food.  The wait staff was super-helpful, and I could easily see this becoming a go-to spot for happy hour or dinner.  Be sure to enjoy the appetizers of cheese-gravy fries, or more healthy options like a veggie and hummus platter.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So good.  Everyone tends to go here for drinks, which is great-  I love the atmosphere and the beer selection at night, but it does get a little crowded.  The news I have or you is that this place is not just a bar.  

I'll say I'm biased and just love the idea of this place - a nice pub feel for those of us that wish to be closer to our irish and english roots with some of those traditional selections on the menu (guiness and irish breakfast complete with black and white pudding, anyone?) but they also have more american options and contemporary or unique spins on \"regular\" 
food, one of my other favorite things to experience.  I also appreciate that they have hooks for hanging jackets and purses dispersed throughout the seating area.

The food is excellent - everything seems high quality and well prepared.  I'll be back for more for sure.  Today I went for brunch and it was amazing.  Great service, nice casual atmosphere and TVs for watching the Packers or Manchester United vs. Chelsea.

Awesome cocktails and food selection - their bloody mary is intense and their breakfast menu has a good mix of items for anyone to find something they like and you can be sure it will taste great.  I had the breakfast sandwich which was good and super filling and I think the english muffin it came on is homemade - this is NOT the english muffin you buy at the grocery store, it is so much better.  One friend had the scrambler - the potatoes were awesome and they were happy to prepare it partially with egg whites for her.  They scramble in different ingredients every day - hers was goat cheese, tomato and red pepper.  The blueberry marscarpone that comes with the french toast is amazing and they give you plenty so you don't run out.  I was ready to eat my friend's leftovers off his plate with a spoon :)  I highly recommend the Pimm's Cup if you're debating over it on the cocktail menu - it's very refreshing and delicious - don't be intimidated by it."}
{"text":"The food is ok. The service is fine. I ordered steak medium rear cooked. I came out as I ordered, it came with strange sauce. I didn't like the sauce on my steak. The fries were overcooked and looked old. I would come back to try their sandwiches. Location is awesome so interior inside. They have a good variety of draft beers."}
{"text":"This restaurant on the Capital Square is a must go! I have been for breakfast on a Saturday morning it it was fantastic!! I have also been for lunch and I must say the selection is great.  I had a Great grilled chicken on a salad that was perfect.  The person I was with got a Ham Sandwich and let me juts tell you this sandwich was one of the best sandwiches I have ever tasted.  The freshness of all the food makes this place an A+++ Great place to relax and sit outside and enjoy the square. Service was good, friendly and helpful staff.  Must go!"}
{"text":"Looked on yelp for a dinner place near the Alliant Energy Center and came to Cooper's to try the steak frites. The view of the Capitol is great, the ambiance is loud but casual and cute and the food was great! Service could have been a bit better but we came on a busy Friday night. We were told the wait would be 20 minutes but they sat us in less than 10. Excellent food!"}
{"text":"The food/beer(huge list)/staff are always good. Would recommend the Chicken Curry. When I got it I was wondering where the fries were that came with it. They were under the chicken, vegetables and curry sauce. Almost like a poutine. Came with a large portion of chicken. Have never sat inside.  It looks small and table look close together. We'll see when it comes winter time for an update."}
{"text":"So I need to preface this by saying that I went to TCT at 130 today for lunch and it was pretty empty...which was pretty great.  Got a prime spot at the bar, got some great recs from a chatty but not overzealous bartender and settled in.  Great TVs, great beer selection, and an awesomely varied menu.  I went with the grilled cheese and didn't disappoint.  The bread was hearty enough to stand up to the cheese and didn't shrink into soaked greasy dough.  The sidecar of tomato soup was a dippers dream and the chips were good.  I maybe would upgrade to fries next time- how did I not??  Anyway- dig in- this place rocks."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a nice evening out on the town in lovely Madison Wisconsin. Heard good things from friends about The Cooper's Tavern so we made it our spot for dinner.  Walking in the place was really cool. Started off with a Guinness with two olives..beertini.  Waiter was very nice. Ordered our meals and it didn't take long to get our food. Ordered the burger and chips.  Others ordered salmon entree. Burger was very tasty chips were yummy.  Fellow dinners enjoyed their salmon but said the portion looked rather small on the large plate. Would recommend The Cooper's Tavern as a great place to try when in Madison Wi.  Go Gophers!!"}
{"text":"The host and waitstaff here were incredibly friendly and competent.  The decor of the place is super cool.  The beer list is amazing.  I don't even like beer, but the waitress suggested Hennepin, which she described as \"Spotted Cow on steroids\" (I like spotted cow) and it was fantastic.

We started with the poutine.  It was sort of a mess.  It was fries with gravy and melted cheese curds on top.  We didn't get silverware right away, so it was a mess to eat.  I got the burger and husband got the reuben.  We ate the burger there, were full, and took the reuben home.  Burger was cooked PERFECTLY.  It was actually medium as ordered.  Pork belly and cheese on top.  It was awesome.

Reuben was ok, didn't like the kraut soaked in beer.  Couldn't really taste the swiss or the sauce.

Overally, the food and service were pretty good.  The main reason for three stars is the food was salty.  And I am a girl that likes salt, so if I'm saying it's too salty, that means something.  We would go back though."}
{"text":"I'm staying at the Madison hotel which this restaurant is behind. Looking to have a late lunch I ask the front desk for a few recommendations and this was the first pick for walking distance.

Atmosphere - very chill and a sports bar type of vibe. There are 4 pretty decent sized televisions and HUGE soccer fans here. Great view of the capital building and also there's a bus stop right out front. Very inviting staff is also a plus. If you're looking for quiet, this is not the place, very passionate sport watchers that are vocal lol! 

Food - I ordered the soup special, an apple and pear bisque and a salad. The Amy salad is a baby spinach salad severed with dried cranberries, candied walnuts, fried goat cheese and dressed with a balsamic vinaigrette. I added chicken breast for protein and delicious. 

Service - fast and accurate service. Waiter was friendly and attentive given it wasn't too packed at this hour. 

All in all if I return to Wisconsin I would stop in again and check out the brunch!"}
{"text":"This is a review for the bartender. First off, he kept referring to us as girls which I found rude. Then when he finally came over to serve us I asked if there was a cocktail list. Not something I thought would be crazy considering it's a restaurant.  Apparently they don't have one, and instead of just telling me this the bartender goes \"This is a beer and whiskey place, we're not at the KK\". I'm 30 years old, I haven't been to the KK in years. I thought it was extremely rude and I won't be going back. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"I'll continue bringing friends to Cooper's mainly because of the great selection of beers.  I've tried several new brews here thanks to great bartenders who are more than willing to offer suggestions.

As mentioned, the service here is excellent. The ambiance is okay - not quite as comfortable as a place like Genna's, but also not overly busy like the Old Fashioned can sometimes get.

I haven't eaten here yet, so I will update this once I do. For now, it's a very solid spot to come try new beers and converse with friends."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with my son and several of his friends.  Busy Saturday night.  Couple of the guys ordered the bone marrow and enjoyed the flavor.  I ordered the mussels and my son ordered salmon.  The mussels and broth were great!! I would highly recommend them- would have liked more bread slices for sopping up the broth.  The salmon had a great maple flavor on the outside and was cooked perfectly!  Service was attentive and helpful when asking questions about the menu.  We ate outside in the patio.  The insider he restaurant  is clean and tidy.  The same could be said for the bathrooms as well. 
cheers!!l."}
{"text":"I was here a few weeks ago, and had an overall good experience.  I had a Reuben sandwich which was done pretty well.  Perhaps on the smaller side of things, but good.  I had greens on the side, which were alright.  I also had a bloody mary, which was very good.  Served with a side of beer, Wisconsin style.

The rest of my companions had good experiences as well.  We were seated in a little private room next to the bar which made the experience pretty unique."}
{"text":"Great food! Live Irish music t'boot."}
{"text":"BEWARE!! They food poisoned me, I had 6 hours of agonizing pain, cold sweats, diarrhea and nausea.

I'm allergic to milk; no its not a sensitivity or lactose intolerance, it's a full on allergy. I made the waitress aware, even though I triple checked with her and sent my food back when I saw it had a dairy based dressing on it, they still managed to poison me. They put cheese in my sandwich and it was melted in so I couldn't see it until I was 3/4 through it.

When I found out I alerted the waitress and she spoke with the owner. The coward hide in the back and they told her to give me the sandwich for free. Gee thanks a free $10 sandwich in exchange for 6 hours of hell. 

Sure not everyone has an allergy and I deal with this a lot. But think on this, if they don't take a potentially life threatening situation seriously, what else don't they take seriously? Food safety, cleanliness? Who knows.. 

Food safety is serious and it's important for everyone, we can all get food poisoning. Don't eat here, the owner clearly doesn't care if their patrons are hurt by their food."}
{"text":"A year after first visiting, Cooper's has definitely gotten some upgrades! They do offer a little over 20 taps (many local ones), which is more than a lot of restaurants can offer. The beer selection is nicely cultivated as well. I had a lovely IIPA from the Great Dane. The server told me that the Great Dane (a Madison brewpub) only distributes their beer to Cooper's as well as serving it at their own establishments. Pretty cool!

They also expanded so they have another floor, which means a shorter wait time. The upstairs is beautifully renovated. Since I was attending for a graduation dinner, the owner kindly welcomed us -- a very nice gesture, and escorted us to our table himself. The menu was fairly limited (perhaps because of graduation), but everybody seemed to find something they enjoyed. I got the mussels and they were nicely prepared with lots of garlic. A few of the people I was dining with said the fish fry was excellent as well...next time.

Service was great once again! The servers did well serving our table of 20 plus!"}
{"text":"So I struggled with this rating:  a 3 or a 4?

The food was great  my son got a burger and claims is was amazing. I got a bowl of the sweet potato chill and it was outstanding.  And their cheese curds could challenge anyone's in the city.

But....they listed a beer as a Scotch all and it was really a Scottish Ale with a nitro pour...big big different. 

So my advice is to make sure you understand the beer before ordering and I will let it go

Definitely will try again.  Suggest you try too"}
{"text":"Awful food. Horrible date place. Too loud. Beer list rarely changes. This is the place you go to to break up with someone."}
{"text":"This place is great!!!! Fast service, great unique food, good beer....what else do I have to say."}
{"text":"I came to Cooper's Tavern today with high hopes! Last time I went, the food and service was great. Today, I wouldn't know if the food was great because I never got it. Well, I got my iced tea and my friend got her frites(which are rather tasty), but after almost an hour after ordering sandwiches, we asked for a check for just the drinks and frites because we just wanted to leave. This was maybe the third time we spoke to our waitress? I don't remember her name, but she is a short redhead. Very unfriendly, and never managed to actually put our order in. After asking for the check, she came back out and said it was on the house and we were free to go, confirming that our lunch order had never actually been put in. We both left pretty pissed off. I won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Great location on the square right on top of state street. Inside and outdoor seating. Great bar lots of selection. The bartender was friendly enough. Comfortable atmosphere. I had the mushroom bisque soup of the day to start and the steak frites. Everything was delicious. I loved the soup wanted to take some home with me. Steak had a nice sear around it and was cooked medium like I asked. No complaints really everything tasted really good. The green beans was a nice component to have with the steak and fries. A lot of people were ordering burgers which looked really good too and they use local fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Went here a couple of weeks ago with my husband--we'd been meaning to try it for awhile.  We sat inside, I forget why, but in the future I think I would try to avoid it--they have this set-up with a long bench along the wall, tables, and chairs on the facing side, which gives it more of a fast food feel than I really like, plus the tables are TINY.  I felt like I was being squashed into people on both sides of me, and it was noisy.

We split an order of chips (fries) before the meal, and they were AMAZING.  Really well done, just the right texture for me (relatively thin for home-made chips, but still just a little soft like I like them, not too many burnt ones), and they came with a DELICIOUS vinegar-infused aoli for dipping.

Husband had some beer that he really liked, and obviously that's their main deal.  I had some wine and it was okay, but I remember thinking that the selection was pretty thin.  I realize it's not their primary thing, but it could have had a little more variety.

For the entree, I had the grilled cheese with a \"shot\" of their Harvest Tomato soup.  I didn't realize when I ordered that they LITERALLY meant a \"shot\"--like, it was served in a shot glass, which was INCREDIBLY inconvenient since it was nearly impossible to dip the sandwich in it, even shredded into small pieces.  What do they think people DO with grilled cheese and tomato soup?!  The container really needed a broader mouth, even if it had held the same volume.

The soup was really good--very flavorful, just a hint of spice, very nice.  The server also said she THOUGHT that it was vegan, although she couldn't confirm--she said the chef likes to do vegan stuff when he can.

The grilled cheese, though, was really disappointing.  The menu listed three kinds of cheese, including cheddar, but it just had no flavor at ALL.  Totally bland.  I'd have been happier with a full bowl of the soup.

If you don't like to be crowded, I'd recommend trying to sit outside in the next few months rather than inside.  And avoid the grilled cheese."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place for a quick lunch or a nice sit down dinner! Every meal I've had there has been wonderful and the beer selection is fantastic. I seem to recall delicious bloody marys as well... The outdoor seating gives you an awesome view of the capital! And they are dog friendly too (for outdoor seating)."}
{"text":"Coopers always delivers. The soup is different daily and delicious each time. Did I mention the vast array of beer? 

One more great thing. Coopers is well known throught the community for connecting the community to its farmers!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch - it's a nice gastopub with an interesting menu.  I had the soup of the day, which was great, and also ordered the beet salad.  I would not order the beet salad again - while I love beets, I just didn't feel like the flavors went together.  My friend ordered a salad as well, but they came out and explained they were out of avocado, which was kind of key to that salad.  She ended up getting it anyway with chicken and thought it was good.

I wouldn't say it's out-of-this-world, but would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"We tried Cooper's for the first time this weekend and it was fantastic. A little crowded - but hey, it was Friday night. 

I highly recommend the ham sandwich on a pretzel bun. I do not recommend the pretzel breadsticks. The pretzel itself is fine - but the cheese dipping sauce is bland. We added salt to the sauce, which helped a bit. Still... I'd rather save the calories for the meal.

We sat by the front window which was a great people-watching opportunity. 

The beer selection was good - but of course I'm lame and ordered my go-to beer: Lake Louie's Scotch Ale. You just can't beat it.

We'll be back for sure.

UPDATE: We tried Cooper's for brunch on a Saturday morning. It was so good we returned the following Saturday. Their breakfast sandwiches on giant English muffins are fantastic - and I highly recommend the banana bread french toast. YUM."}
{"text":"Decent bar food and drinks. Nice staff. We had the hamburger and fish & chips. Well prepared but nothing special. Popular with more patrons than other places in the area. Obviously a well liked place."}
{"text":"Visited a friend in Madison to see a show and stumbled upon this gem! After hearing there was a 30 minute wait, they offered their upstairs dining area with a special menu that had no wait. We glanced at the menu quick and decided to give it a try!  

The atmosphere was very urban industrial but warm and upscale with large harvest tables that is great for groups. The upstairs had a wall of windows facing the capital which made for a breathtaking view. 

The server was very attentive and helpful with the menu and even offered to take a picture of us. 

I got the short rip with gnocchi and was not disappointed! I couldn't believe how tender it was, no knife needed! 

They have a full bar and I ordered a Moscow Mule that was good!"}
{"text":"Okay Cooper's, I want to be friends with you. There is so much potential here ready to be unleashed, and I want to be there when you do. Unfortunately, there are a few glaring issues that prevent me from truly being your friend or your BFF. Let's keep talking to see how it goes, and we can consider a relationship later.

We visited Cooper's on a weeknight for a bite to eat and to meet with a friend. We opted to sit on the patio and enjoy the nice weather. First off, your view of the Capitol building is amazing. Second off, why do you have customers share tables? I mentioned in my Pig in a Fur Coat review that normally this is an awkward experience. Cooper's, it was awkward. I want my own table and to not share the paper pushing discussion of the two coworkers getting a bite after work.

Cooper's has a very solid beer list. If there isn't something on tap they have listed because you're \"that person,\" (no worries, I'm sometimes \"that person too\" so don't feel bad), there will be at least 5 beers available in bottle that you will craze. Cooper's has you covered.

There were no cheese curds on the menu... I don't know how that is possible, but it was. I guess Cooper's isn't trying to be Old Fashioned too hard!

Since cheese curds were out of the option we ordered pretzels with a Guinness sauce as an appetizer. Major props on the sauce guys. Anyone can make a soft-pretzel well, but most people will serve it with garlic sauce or cheese product. While I may enjoy those at a sporting event, I want something more for dinner. Your sauce works, it's awesome. I want it bottled.

Now here is where it gets awkward. I ordered the lobster mac n' cheese for dinner. It was $19, and I was expecting something solid because we're in Wisconsin so ordering a dinner based around cheese is a no brainer. It wasn't good, guys. I was greatly let down by this dish, and I do not think it should sit on the menu for $19 or exist at all. 

The lobster was overcooked and chewy. I could barely taste the cheese. It's mac n CHEESE, Cooper's! I know you probably got distracted in the grocery store by that bottle of truffle oil and forgot to buy enough cheese but come on! It's unfortunate that the primary ingredients didn't deliver. Well, at least the pasta was cooked properly. 

Back to the truffle oil, why? I know you think you're Alinea, but you're not. Truffle oil is gimmicky and it makes everything else taste like truffle oil. It absolutely overpowered every single other ingredient in the food, which is a HUGE problem when you are serving lobster. Lobster is ridiculously easy to out flavor with other ingredients. Let the lobster shine, guys. It's the feature of the dish!

The entree did come with a salad. The ingredients were crispy and the dressing was delicious. I think I enjoyed the salad more than the main feature.

Service was about what I expect. Drinks were topped off, we were asked how everything was. It was nothing exceptional or disappointing. Kudos!

Cooper's, I want to like you, and I appreciate many things about you, but that one dish was executed so poorly that I cannot look past it. Let's continue to hang out with other people, but we can keep our options open. If we do hang out, please don't bring Dave, the lobster mac n cheese with you. No one likes Dave."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and twice last week for the superior, tender and lean Reuben on lightly grilled dark rye with homemade fries ($1.50 extra but worth it)  or greens.  Their chips are also homemade.  I must be adventurous and try other menu options.  Maybe the chicken Cobb salad next time.  This is an excellent bistro all around."}
{"text":"Great food & drink selection! Loved the vegan options, but hated the fact that they don't allow dogs on their patio!!! Unfortunately, not a place I would return in the summer months for this reason :/"}
{"text":"Our server was nice but sadly the food was just ok.

We ordered the following dishes:

Bone marrow: the bone marrow was good but the crostini that came with it was stale, old and chewy it was so hard to chew. We asked if it's suppose to be crunchy because most crostini are and the server says I honestly don't know ................ Well she went to go and ask the cook if they can make the crostini crunchy.... They did but she only came out with two pieces.... Reallllllyyyyy there's two of us and we have two big Bones with bone marrow... Well she At least she tried.

Butter chicken and halfsies: hmmm it's a wanna be chicken curry with undercooked soupy rice........

Pork belly Mac: the pork belly was good sadly the skin was soggy from the cheese sauce.. The pasta was over cooked. The idea of the dish was pretty cool though.

Steak frites: if you want steak in your butter order this you'd love it!"}
{"text":"One of the more inventive menus I've seen at a tavern. The mustard sauce on the pretzel crusted chicken was delicious, but the Brussel sprouts were slightly disappointing."}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday brunch; service, quality, and ambiance were all amazing!

Brunch is served until late afternoon so if you don't wake up early you can hit this spot.  The inside is a shotgun style restaurant and really cozy for small groups with a long bar if you'd rather sit there.  The beer list is quite extensive but they also serve mimosas and bloodys.  I ordered a mimosa which was a generous, strong pour and the meat scramble special with ham, brussel sprouts, and cheese. I loved this dish because it was prepared as scrambled eggs instead of your typical skillet scramble.  The side of crispy breakfast potatoes were amazing too.  I cleaned my plate.

My boyfriend got the crab cake Benedict and the crab cakes were served as the english muffin substitute, pretty genius. The eggs were cooked in duck fast and the hollandaise sauce was creamy with a buttery flavor.  Equally as amazing as my dish."}
{"text":"Really liked the atmosphere and staff at this centrally located place, and if you come here for one reason only, make it a pretzel. 

The food and beer options are great, with some unique takes on classic dishes to take a little bit of the ho-hum out of pub food. Some of those unique takes are more or less successful. The french onion soup being one of the more successful items, the poblano caesar less so. The pretzel was incredibly delicious, with a really nice beer cheese sauce on the side. 

Bartenders were super helpful in making beer choices, and overall it's a nice place to spend an evening."}
{"text":"So - I've been yelping for quite a while and have never written a review. Not cool - I know. Never too late to start! My husband and I biked to Cooper's Tavern as we've passed it several times while at the Farmer's Market on the Square (which you have to definitely check out if you haven't yet)! We were... disappointed. 

Ambience - really really cute, very nice on the eyes. 

But the food- mediocre. Do not get the beer cheese pretzels - they're like breadsticks, more than anything else. I got the goat cheese polenta - the veggies were doused in grilling oil and the polenta was... nothing special. My husband got the special- lamb tartine which was good, not great. 

If anything - Cooper's Tavern is a good place to go for a drink and their fries - which were fantastic! I don't think we'd bother trying anything else on the menu. :("}
{"text":"Hm. First I hit three stars, then four...and back to three. I've been here twice, once was intentionally for brunch, and another for lunch. I'd go again if someone suggested it, but it's not at the top of my list.

Everyone seemed happy with their food choices, and the menu is interesting. My last dish was the sweet potato chili. Flavorful and spicy, but thick for my taste. Cornbread was less than memorable. 

Service was nice, and the food came out lickety-split. Also, the server didn't roll his eyes(can't say the same for myself) when my boyfriend's mom had to be explained what a \"shot of soup\" is. Um, it's a shot. Nope, not a small cup. It's a shot glass--and then she asked for a spoon for her shot. Oy. That alone almost deserves a star."}
{"text":"One of the better beer selections in Madison. Any place that has Goose Island Matilda on tap will get a return trip from me. The bar just looks really cool, with bright wood finishes and huge windows on the second floor looking out to the Capitol. The place just feels inviting. 

Has been a lot better since they opened the second level. It used to be impossible to get a spot there as this place is always packed!"}
{"text":"Visiting Madison while attending a conference. Hotel front desk recommended trying this place for lunch on Sunday before heading home. When we arrived, it was packed and stayed very busy during our entire visit. We ordered from their brunch menu - corned beef hash (very flavorful) served with two fried eggs (done perfectly), and a side of fresh fruit (blueberries, blackberries, melon, etc); their American breakfast (2 fluffy scrambled organic eggs, breakfast potatoes, 2 strips bacon, whole wheat toast-mmm that bread!); a house made cinnamon roll (this was the only item we both found just mediocre in flavor); Belgian frites served with a tasty malt-vinegar aioli dipping sauce; cranberry juice; and a Founders Breakfast Imperial Coffee Stout from Michigan. We were not disappointed, it was delicious food, with a menu that held many other tempting offerings. We saw at least a dozen plates of Coopers Curds (beer battered Wisconsin cheese curds with a ranch dressing dip) pass by that looked so yummy we almost snuck one off a passing plate!  
The atmosphere was relaxed and loud! It seems taverns in Madison are filled with friendly, noisy folks! Seating is in very close quarters, making conversation difficult."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service! My party of 7 was seated in the little private room off the bar, where we were served through a window by the bartender. Maybe not for everyone, but I loved the ambience and the bartender was very friendly and attentive.

One of our appetizers was late due to a kitchen mistake, and the house gave it to us for free in addition to giving us 2 free desserts! I am new to the Midwest and have never experienced such excellent service. It was absolutely unprecedented but so appreciated. 

I also loved how their vegetarian entree option wasn't the standard boring roast vegetables but a delicious mushroom manicotti. I would recommend if to omnivores as well, it was incredible! The walnuts were an extremely tasty touch to an already tender and flavorful dish. 

This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to and it has made me excited to return!"}
{"text":"The beer selections (solid list of bottles and usually good rotating tap list) are the highlight when you come here.  I feel the food is good and the menu has a variety of options but I haven't found a dish that would compel me to come back just so I could have it again.  On the other hand, when they have St. Bernadus Abt 12 on tap, save me a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"What a turnaround! I came here on one of the busiest weekends (college graduation), and our service and food was spectacular. 

Calling ahead on graduation weekend, I knew getting a table anywhere would be a long shot, especially given that our group was 11 people. Cooper's gave us an accurate time we would be waiting, and we were given drinks right away. Seeing how busy the restaurant was, I assumed service would be slower if not spotty. Not only was service amazing (kudos to our bartender/server Tyler), but our food and drinks arrived on time and very well made. Our drinks were refilled regularly, and everyone enjoyed their meals. I ordered mussels with bone marrow (always amazing).

Busy but so pleasant. Service: astonishing. As I said before, such a turnaround. I was amazed how well our experience was in such a busy restaurant during a busy weekend. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because of the noise. HUGE noise level on Friday night. Nice unique choices on the menus."}
{"text":"Spending two hours rallying really works up a girl's appetite, so I decided to come and try this place out, as I've been meaning to for awhile and been too lazy to leave my hermit cave of an apartment.

I ordered the Cooper's Burger and it was pretty good: grass-fed beef, pork belly, some fresh lettuce and a nice aioli to taste. The food was easily four stars and was pretty good.

The bathrooms are kept very clean (although, there's only one). The service is also pretty decent; I've seen some inconsistencies here about it and I was a little weary before I walked in, but I must've been lucky and came on a good day because my waiter and the manager were both quite friendly.

This place is pretty small and some of the seating is kind of awkward; I was placed inbetween two groups by myself when there was plenty of other seats elsewhere. I'm sure it might've been easier on the waiters, but it was just kind of weird to be seated next to a family and two guys talking about finances.

Also, the alcohol list is pretty nice; at least 3 pages on beer alone. Kind of hot, actually, even if I'm not huge on beer.

That said, it's a pretty affordable place, the service is relatively friendly if you come in on a good day, and it's got a nice view of the capitol. But I'd avoid bringing large groups of people and kids--don't think this is a good place for either."}
{"text":"Nice place, almost always a wait with reason.  I had the pot pie which was awesome! Very delicious and filling however there was only 2 small pieces of meat in it.  Besides that, service was good, drinks were mixed well and despite getting a bad shake on chicken in the pot pie it was excellent.  Definitely will go back.  FYI beware of the wait, it does get really loud and there are a ton of sketchy homeless people outside at night."}
{"text":"I was in Madison for business by myself and was looking for a spot to just chill out after a long day of meetings. So, based on the recommendation of a local, I headed over to Cooper's. Nice, cozy space--and it wasn't crowded when I was in there. I didn't go with beer on this visit; however, the beer list is really as extensive as everyone says. I did, however, go with a cider. A 22oz delicious cider. I wish I could remember the name....but it eludes me.

Now, onto the food. WI is known for it's cheese. Hardcore. Looking over the menu, I was torn between the poutine, bone marrow, pork belly mac and cheese, the reuben and the grilled cheese. I struck up a convo with the bartender....and asked for his recs. He fell heavy on the mac and cheese--even noting that it was featured on the show \"The Big Cheese.\" My response? I'm from New Haven, dude....the cheese shop (and restaurant, Caseus--yum!)  the host of \"The Big Cheese\" owns is in my town. So, pork belly mac and cheese it was....and bone marrow. Because, really, who can resist marrow when it's on the menu.

The marrow was melt in my mouth delicious. I could have eaten two more, easily. The mac however....after all the talking up that was done...was disappointing! The pork belly was way overcooked (what!). While the combo of cheese used was good, there was something almost...sweet, to the whole dish that just didn't work. Considering the glaze on the belly was Guinness...who knows where that came from.

While I won't hesitate to stop back in for the rocking service (seriously, such great bartenders!) and interesting menu next time I'm back in Madison...I won't be trying that mac again. Definitely a good chill spot, though!"}
{"text":"Let's get the bad out of the way....the bartenders suck!!  No personality...not at all in tune with the customer. Everything had to be asked for. With that said....service was less important than the \"AMAZING\" salmon dish that I had. A top 5 all time....expect a service level consistent with a college town, but in the end if the food is great that's what is most important."}
{"text":"In loooove. Especially with the frites (and that aioli?!) and the southwestern Caesar salad - it tastes like guacamole and a Caesar salad mixed together. Amazing. Service is always attentive and friendly. Prices are reasonable, too; I got a great, filling lunch with a friend for $10 each."}
{"text":"First night in Madison, this is close to our hotel, and I have Irish in me, so this is my pick. Yelp reviews seemed ok. It's a pseudo-Irish place which, of course, is about all you can find in North America. They can't compare (on any level) if you've been to the island. But I like to at least try to pretend I'm back for a spell. Anyway...

The waitress was nice. Her service was slow as it was very busy. I can completely understand this, and we're on vacation so we are in no rush. You can get to us when you can, but when you do, don't be inattentive...

On this hot and humid night, our waters and beers were dripping all over the place on a cool metal table (no holes). All other tables had coasters but our waitress did not bring us any. The table was rocking to and fro, and she suggested from the get go she would bring us some coasters that we could use to prop it. Ten minutes go by with repeated trips to other patrons, and I decided to go into the restaurant myself for them. Problems solved.

My wife asked for a recommended beer from the bar based on her tastes, but still ordered her go-to Stella. She asked the waitress a HALF HOUR later if they had something like she wanted, and she said she was still waiting on the bar (ehm, yeeeaaah). An hour or more after the question, she was served her beer. This didn't really bother me until the end, btw. This can get lost when a place is busy.

Food came. We ordered a poutine to split. This is something I was delighted to see on the menu, as a Canadian. I was hoping they'd be up to it. But, sadly not. Yellow cheddar curds were used, and a lumpy, bland, light-coloured & COOL gravy was very sparingly used over the uninspired soggy fries. It looked like crap and if not for the oversalting, may have tasted as such. The cheese was in clumps you actually had to CUT with a knife (not melted where you twist it onto your fries like spaghetti). NOT a Canadian poutine...by the miles that run from Wisconsin to Toronto. I should have known better. Be warned.

Thanks to a big late lunch after our trip from Michigan, we split the poutine, and ordered one meal to also split - a ravioli special. It was next to tasteless and, if not for the watery cream sauce that came with it, was actually partially dried out. The shredded beef in the middle of the dish was laughably bland and likewise dry. Not impressed and glad we were not too hungry to begin with. Mediocre. This was a special!

Our second round of beer took 20 minutes to arrive after ordering. And we sat so long waiting for the bill, my wife took our daughter for a walk after nursing them. I waited another 15 minutes sitting on my own while the waitress waited on other tables. Any server with an ounce of attention and care for your experience would take the hint with the family gone that you're late with the cheque. Then she talks me up for a minute in an obvious attempt to curry a tip. She ended up with 15% and it should have been less. But I usually go 20-25% when the service is good.

Not impressed and will certainly not return. The prices were ok, but the food didn't match. And the service for me was just plain bad. Love the smile, but bring something behind it. And trust me, we were in no rush. I just like to feel like you're still cared for after you've ordered. She only had 4-5 tables... 

The one star seems harsh here, so I am going with two. They have some interesting to excellent beers here, and that's all I would come here for --- and only if I were to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"What a great dinner. It was me, my wife and our 8 yo son. We shared several different items. The lobster Mac while expansive had about half a lobster in that tureen and was delicious. Little one loved the mini hamburgers and the French onion soup was very flavorful."}
{"text":"The meals are a-ok but some wines that I'd see in wine shops on the drink menu are a bit over price or just a half full glass. So one day while here in Madison, My Brazilian friend Jessica and I went there for dinner and the one thing that did help the place was the service for the host at the door making some room for the two of us. I can't recall his name by he was a very nice guy and hope he is get an better position there soon. But when he ask us after we sat down what he can get us, we explain to him what we wanted and he told the waiter our drinks orders and that is where it took a turn for slow and confuse waiter service. The waiter after 10 minutes came to our table and ask what can I start you with? By the way it was a male not female waiter, and I reply back and told him we already order when the Host told you our drinks. Then he realize our drinks have been sitting at the bar for a while now. The beer was so so flat and the red was good doe Jessica. Now when it come to food, not a fan of the mussels I've eaten, some of the mussels under-cook and some felt like there were over cooked. Not sure they mix one order with another because they do that kind of thing in a kitchen to make up time. But speaking of time, food times were about 20 minute wait for there was a couple sitting next to us that were there before us just waiting on their food and we got our food first. This is the reason why I said someone mix overcooked mussels with undercooked mussels. But back to the story, as  I was saying before, we got our food first then they didn't receive their food until 10 minutes after we received our dinner which means the same waiter can't handle pressure in a fast moving restaurant. Jessica and I felted so bad and was concern about food because she wasn't really happy with the quality of food and I wasn't either but trial and error right. But I'd tip over 25% to the service but that doesn't mean I did that for the waiter. he was slow and only return to our table just twice, one to order food and once we had our meal finish to ask us how was the food and I spoke the truth. So So this can use more of this and that.
So I went the next time with a friend to see the difference in food and time to see if there was another cook in the kitchen to try something out and it was difference after eating the salmon and it was delicious and much less wait time and it was still busy. I just didn't want that say waiter again.  So is it a good place to bring your other half or your family? Well Family I am not so sure but friend, wife, girlfriend or partner? I would say yes and no because it just depend on your mood and taste. It's up to you"}
{"text":"Looking for food? You won't get it here. Do yourself a favor and actually read the reviews instead of just looking at the star rating, which I did not do. I'm disgusted I wasted the 30-minutes waiting for a table, and the calories on this place.

I had the chicken sandwich...really how do you screw that up? It had to been smoked or something - It was so DRY. Not to mention, it has been about an hour since I ate, and I cannot get the salt taste off of my tongue. That sandwich had enough salt for a six months supply.

I'm sure the beer the selection is good, but skip the food."}
{"text":"The steak frites was melt in your mouth delicious. Great booze selection too. Everyone was very happy with their food. Only downside is the space and the noise level is quite high. Will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Coopers. Place is 5 stars all the way. If you are only there for a drink, specially beer. Amazing beer selection, great pour by the bartender every time, and service.

The food is... okay. It's not bad, but it's not great. Cheese curds are fine, not the best curds by any stretch but still good. The mussels and fries were fine also.  They were seasoned well, the mussels tasted fresh, no fishy-ness. Fries were soggy, and not from the mussels or the broth. They weren't cooked all the way through, and not crispy on the outside at all. Seemed to be fried one time only, and any good fries are double fried, once to cook them through and again to make them crispy.

Just drink the beer."}
{"text":"The steak frites looked beautiful but was so tough I didn't even bother finishing it. Me leaving asteak unfinished? That's unheard of."}
{"text":"I always enjoy coopers!  They make an amazing Pimms cup...mmmm.  Food has always been really good as well. However, my only complaint is the scruffy looking angry male bartender who ruins the ambience in this place.  He either needs to work in a cubicle with no contact with people or have the extremely large stick up his butt surgically removed.  All other staff has always been awesome!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I went to Cooper's Tavern for lunch recently while I was in town. I was immediately impressed by the simple yet good looking menu, and had a tough time deciding between one of the salads and the veggie sandwich. 

I went with the sandwich, and it was pretty good. They give you practically an entree mixed greens salad along with the sandwich, so it was very filling, and tasty. My friends enjoyed their burgers.

What I was especially impressed by, however, were the appetizers. We got frites, my favorite, and a pretzel/beer cheese app. Both were great. We also had great service and found it to be a nice atmosphere. I could see returning for some beer one night!"}
{"text":"My Bavarian Beer Stew was dry - I don't think it could be fairly called a stew because there was no liquid in it.  On the bright side I got to watch my dining partner eat the Sconnie Egg - and it tasted as delicious in my mind as it did in his mouth.

Beer - yup, lots. Friendly eager to please waiter who apologized when our entrees were delivered right along with our appetizers. Who's running the kitchen?"}
{"text":"Came here after a drunk afternoon nap. The beers and poutine with wisconsin-style cheese curds on it, hit the spot. Plenty of space to pull a stool up to the bar and relax."}
{"text":"I recently made the move to Madison so it has been fun to try out new places. I stopped at the Cooper's Tavern for dinner and a few drinks with friends from out of town and it did not disappoint! We walked in and the place was packed since it was a Friday night.. told us we'd have to wait about 30 minutes if we wanted a spot. However, if we were interested in trying a special limited menu upstairs we could be seated right away. 

That kind of stuff is right up my alley. So upstairs we went. The atmosphere is amazing. There are big windows overlooking the Capitol square, and we were seated right along the windows. It was perfect. The waitress was very friendly and informed us that on the weekends they use these special menus to try out new recipes to see how they go over with the customers. Because of this, the prices were very reasonable. 

We got a pretzel appetizer which was just okay. But for the meal I ordered their beet salad with goat cheese and a homemade vinaigrette. It was AMAZING. My friends got the short rib and squash risotto, both of which were very good. The short rib was tender and just fell apart with a fork. Ever since I left I've been looking forward to going back!!"}
{"text":"I went here a couple of weeks ago and really enjoyed the view of the capitol building from the outdoor seating. Definitely a great place if you have people visiting for the view. 

It looked like they had a pretty good selection of beverages however I did not try any this time.

I did have the Pretzel Encrusted Chicken which was just okay. By all means not horrible but it did not make me want to get it a second time if I were to return. The service was good so I don't hesitate to make another visit."}
{"text":"Opposite of many restaurants, Cooper's seems to have gotten better over time. I liked it when I first went years ago, but it became more of a spot to grab a drink when it wasn't crazy packed and a hunt to snag the snug. 

Within the last year or so I've attended a few private events upstairs and loved the catering options. The pretzels and dip, tiny steak sandwiches, and fresh veggie options are by far some of the best bites I've had from a catering outfit. 

Inspired by those delicious dishes I hit up Cooper's for lunch. A quick scan of some photos on Yelp got me hyped up for one of my go-tos: the turkey sandwich. I'm a sucker for carved turkey and Cooper's doesn't disappoint. The meat was good quality and was definitely fresh. No deli meat here. Crispy bacon and tarragon aioli sealed the deal to make a yummy sandwich. The wheat bread wasn't my favorite, and next time I think I'll take my colleague's lead and sub in their sourdough. That looked like the perfect vehicle for this sandwich. 

An unexpected highlight was the chips that came on the side. Cooper's fries them fresh and I am so grateful they haven't gone the kettle-cooked route that so many places favor. I like kettle chips, but I've got a limit. Their perfect potato chips are crispy, a deep golden brown, and were so yummy that I couldn't stop eating them. I could stretch out my sandwich into a second serving, but those chips didn't make it to the next day. 

Service was attentive but not overwhelming, and the light brick and warm lighting make for a nice dining room. It can still get pretty crowded at night and on weekends, but if you can swing an off-peak hour it's a great choice."}
{"text":"After having a terrible experience due to bad service on our first visit, the general manager went out of his way to remediate the problem. He emailed me within a couple days of me posting a negative review and apologized about our experience. He informed me that the bartender who had waited on my boyfriend and I had been fired, and invited us to come back for dinner and drinks on him.
We took him up on the offer tonight, and were very impressed. The bartender who waited on us tonight was very friendly and provided great service. Our food (steak frites and the sweet corn Caesar) was wonderful, and we will hopefully be back soon.
I can't say enough about how impressed I am with the management's effort to make sure all of their customers are happy, and I really appreciated the effort that was made on our behalf."}
{"text":"Executive summary: salad was fantastic, seasonally rotating vegan AND gluten-sensitive entrée available, server was cheerful, helpful, and funny,  atmosphere is cool, restrooms were clean, downtown = no parking.  For my full review, read on!

I'm not usually a fan of salad as a dinner but their sweet corn Caesar salad was AMAZING!  The beet soaked hard boiled egg was a nice touch and the poblano-caesar dressing was delicious.

They have a limited gluten-sensitive menu and since they don't have separate friers the frites could be an issue depending how sensitive you are.  They do have the local herbivore which is a seasonal rotation of local produce made completely vegan AND gluten-sensitive.  The night I was there it was a north African style dish with red peppers, cauliflower, parsnips, and carrots.  Since I dislike two of those four veggies I opted for the salad instead, sans-croutons and baguette.  My friend had the local herbivore though, and she loved it.

Our table also shared the cheese curds and frites.  I've had better curds so I only had a few.  They weren't worth risking the gluten.  The frites were only ok in my opinion.  I prefer crispy and these were pretty soggy.  The ones at bottom of the cone were especially soggy and oily.  The malt vinegar aioli was delicious though.  Although, because malt vinegar can contain barley, rye, or wheat it's not gluten sensitive.

Our server was great: cheerful, helpful, interactive, and funny.  She was also patient.  She brought my friend at least 3 samples of beer because my friend couldn't decide which one to order.

The restaurant itself is long and narrow with tables on one side and a bar on the other.  It's got a cool atmosphere, all old wood and exposed brick.  The restrooms could be better lit.  And the women's room only has two stalls but I think for an old building downtown that's the best you're likely to get.  They were clean and well stocked and in the end, that's the most important.

Parking downtown is usually a hassle, especially right on the square so plan on parking in a ramp and hoofing it.

I might stop here again in a different season to check out the next local herbivore offering, or the next time I'm hankering for a sweet corn Caesar salad...man was it yummy!"}
{"text":"Had the steak fritas: sliced juicy medium rare steak with sides of cooked green beans and fries. The steak was wonderful but the fries were too salty. It is a decently sized platter and the Amy's sale loomed fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Great food for lunch. Lots of options. Service is sometimes a little cold... Bordering on rude."}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled upon this place and were pretty impressed with the menu so we decided to get brunch there. I loved the atmosphere inside, though we chose to sit outside as we had a front row view of the capital. 

We started with some bloody mary's and, well, yum. Fixin's galore and they came with a beer chaser (craft beer, not sure which) which was a nice added touch. 

Then I ordered the Scandinavian Benedict. It was pretty tasty. Part of the salmon looked/tasted a little skunky but I moved around that part and finished the rest. My friend, however--her veggie sandwich was SO good. The veggies were all chopped up, which was unique to me. And the flavors were spot on. The feta, hummus and dried tomatoes added so much.  

I would definitely go back here."}
{"text":"Honestly the beer list and service saved this from being a single star. I was so excited to try out Cooper's! Even with the fantastic location, look of the place, and what's on the menu (in theory), it was very disappointing. 

To be clear, server was pleasant and prompt, especially given the size of the group we had. The noise level got so high that we were practically screaming to hear eachother, much less the server, the poor thing.

Anyhow my true sorrow lay with the food.

Sadly they were out of the bone marrow, the dish that I had really been looking forward to trying. (Always comparing bone marrows!) So, instead I split a variety of dishes with a friend. We got the Brie en Croute, Mussels du Jour, and Pork Belly Mac.

The Brie en Croute itself was very tasty. The fruit and nuts they served it with seemed to serve more in a visual capacity rather than enhancing the taste of the dish but were amusing enough to nibble on. The bread was frustrating. It was ridiculously tough and nearly stale tasting. Nothing more fun than trying to salivate enough to be able to chew your food into submission! I ended up giving up on it all together. 

The Mussels du Jour were ok? I think? The dish seemed confused about itself. The mussels themselves and the broth were delicious. However the dish was topped with fries. Odd but not entirely out of place taste-wise. Then we got under the first layer and there were slices of plain boild potato under it! Not only was that aspect bland and unappealing, it just seemed straight up cheap. A way to make the dish seem bigger than it truly was. I was also very disappointed that we didn't get bread to soak up all the broth, one of the best parts about mussels prepared this way! (May have dodged a bullet there considering the bread from the brie)

The Pork Belly Mac had a good base. The mac itself was perfect. Well textured pasta with a slightly sharp and thick cheese sauce (I did have to carefully extract a piece that wasn't coated in the other ingredients to find that out. Why the hell would you make a good cheese sauce only to shove it under loud clashing flavors?!). The pork belly was fantastically crisp on the outside and full of deliciously melty fat on the inside, a perfect substitute for my lack of marrow. The little onion crisps were a perfect match and I could have just eaten a bowl of those like fries! Unfortunately they felt the need to add sriracha and pickled pears. I'm a bit of a sriracha sloot but that flavor of heat was incredibly out of place in this dish. It overwhelmed all the positives and let you really soak in the failings of the dish. The pickled pears solo were fun, but they were added to the dish in massive chunks. I think the flavor combination may have made more sense if the pears had been in smaller pieces. 

Overall it just seemed like Cooper's was trying far too hard to come up with some unusual striking combinations without paying any attention to the end product. There were so many interesting looking dishes but the execution is so sloppy. Very annoyed that I paid so much for small portions of disappointment. 

The good news is the beer list is fairly extensive so kill your taste-buds with a few brews!"}
{"text":"Great view of the capital.   Food was outstanding and great beer choice.  The flank steak special had wonderful flavor, fine presentation, and excellent service."}
{"text":"I came here between 5-7 times within a month's time, so I have a pretty good idea of what they have and more importantly, the consistency of the food.

Firstly, the food is freaking amazing. Probably because anything with beef and/or cheese is out of this world in Wisconsin, compared to California. My favorites were the Fish and Chips, and the Rocket Sliders (by a landslide).

Secondly, they have an ever-rotating selection of micro-brews that were unlike most of the stuff I can get back in California, especially one of the most amazing beers I've had the chance to taste - Kentucky Breakfast Stout.

Overall, this was my staple go-to restaurant, and sometimes find myself missing it."}
{"text":"Oh, the dulcet tones of RE CALL WALK ER while we attempted to enjoy our al fresco dinner.  Which isn't to say that I disagree with the sentiment - just that it interfered with the otherwise very pleasant ambiance of Coopers Tavern.

We stopped in for dinner a few weeks ago on the recommendation of our Airbnb host - when he learned we liked beer, he insisted that we try Coopers.  We were grateful for the recommendation!.  I really enjoyed the Irish Cobb salad - house-cured corned beef, oven-dried tomatoes, asparagus, hard-boiled egg, Dubliner, and scallion-mustard dressing - but we were disappointed in the beer cheese pretzels, as the \"dip\" was more like soup.

I'm not sure where to rate the service, exactly.  I think our server was new, but she was definitely enthusiastic, peppering us for our drink order before we'd had a chance to open the menu.  When my husband asked about a beer listed on the menu, she informed him that they were out but it was SO GOOD.  Very helpful!  He really wanted the beer, and now would obviously have to take his drinking dollars elsewhere if he wanted to try something that was obviously recommended.

Despite that overly grumpy digression, we'd definitely give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Came in around 6 or so on a Friday evening, but luckily we didn't have to wait for a table. The place was already quite crowded though, and the tables next to us filled up quickly. Service started off okay, our waiter was extremely friendly, although he seemed very busy. 

We ordered the Wagyu sliders to start, with housemade chips. Highly recommend this as an appetizer to share. The beef was cooked medium, and very flavorful. Served on mini pretzel buns. Very cute and delicious. 

My boyfriend ordered the pork belly mac, and I had the steak frites. My dish was pretty self explanatory - steak (I asked for medium, got it closer to well-done), and frites. Not anything outstanding nor special, but delicious nonetheless. The pork belly mac was pretty standard too. Mac and cheese was good (but then again, when ISN'T mac and cheese good??!), and pork belly, while was a little on the tough side, was decently flavorful. 

Towards the end of our meal, a waitress, who was serving the table next to us, leaned across and over my boyfriend to hand the table next to us their check. It was an extremely awkward moment for him as he couldn't move out of the way. She could have walked up to the table and handed the bill to them just fine, but reaching over someone else is plain rude and awkward. 

The food, while good, was nothing exceptionally special. I would come here again if a group of friends wanted to, but I wouldn't personally choose to come here again if I had other options."}
{"text":"Great beer selection The draft choices are always thoughtful-- good variation without being overwhelming. Good food-- the frites and burger are delicious. And the hummus is good-- I think its changed over the past year, and I wish they'd bring back the old stuff!
Always crowded-- and yet, not impossible to get a table for two. Have watched a couple Badger games here over dinner, and Cooper's affords a compromise between junky-sportsbar-eating-basket-fries and one-tiny-television-in-a-nice-restaurant."}
{"text":"Good coctail. Service was awesome. I had the polenta. Pretty good. I'm not sure how the polenta was cooked... little mealy. I would've preferred it be pan fried or something. My boyfriend had the brisket sandwich. He said it was good, especially the bacon aioli."}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoyed this place. I really want to enjoy every place I go to but this place made it hard. Initially we attempted to go to the Old Fashioned but there was a 45 minute wait and I am totally not about 'that life'.  The man suggested going to Coopers instead and I thought it was a good choice , at first.  They do have  an expansive beer selection and though I am far from a beer connoisser I found a rasberry one that I really enjoyed.  

The food at this place is a little meh though.  We ordered an egg roll dish with mash potatoes and roast beef that was okay but it was deep fried and it's hard to go wrong with deep fried.  To combat that I ordered a salad.  The salad was fine but I would have preferred a little less salad dressing on it as the lettuce appeared to be wilted from all the salad dressing.  The man got mussels, he gets these everywhere now!  I don't think he wanted admit it but he did not like them that much.  He kept mentioning that they were okay but he wished they had more flavor. 

All in all I would go back to this place, not to eat, but to try more beers on their menu.  It's kind of a shame because with more effort put into the food this place could be a real winner."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and the service is consistently great. Food is excellent too, though I admittedly stick with the burger most outings. They serve root beer in a huge mug which I also appreciate because most places just use a glass or medium sized mug or serve it in a bottle alone. The WiFi is of sufficient quality for me to watch fuller house at a relatively good download while waiting. 5 star"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch and great place for beer.  Ask to sit in the nook...it is a private booth that is a tribute to when women couldn't drink in bars.  Seriously, it cool...and the bartender servers you through a sliding wooden window just off the bar, it's a hoot."}
{"text":"Great place on the square especially in the summer when you can sit outside.  The salmon I had was excellent.  This place is definitely worth a try if you haven't been yet!"}
{"text":"Cooper's is a good option for beer and \"fancy\" bar food in a casual pub-like atmosphere. I like to take friends here from out of town because it's good, but it's unimposing. I don't feel like I need to eat a full meal here which makes it a good place to hang out and drink without being rushed. The outside seating in the summer is an excellent option. I love the fries and malt vinegar aioli in particular!"}
{"text":"I come here to eat all the time. They serve food late, and the quality of ingredients is as good as it gets in madison. I recommend the ruben soup. Huge selection of beers and ciders. Great brunch. Staff could be improved, but they've only been open for about a year."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch. Great brunch and great coffee. Unique seasonal menu...very close to hotels off of the capital. Like the outdoor seating. 

We ordered the biscuits while waiting for our entrees and have to admit some of the best buttery warm biscuits I've ever had. 

A good place to check out on a weekend."}
{"text":"i've been here a few times now. the beer list is pretty solid, but the bloody marys are just ok. the turkey sandwich is awesome (with gouda and apple-pear slaw, yum!), and they definitely get points for having poutine on the menu. i would come more often if it wasn't always packed to the gills."}
{"text":"[This review is based on two meals, dinner last year and brunch last week.]

Meal 1: Dinner

I've stepped into Coopers a few times hoping to have a beer with some colleagues but it's always been so crowded that we've gone elsewhere.  Finally went for dinner tonight with my wife and was quite disappointed.  

As many other reviewers have mentioned, Coopers has a horrible layout and always feels cramped, so we decided to sit outside, even though it was unseasonably chilly.

Service: Ok.  The waitress was very nice, though she forgot to bring us water the first time we asked for it.  She also didn't tell us the specials (although the host had when we were looking at the menu and deciding whether or not to dine there, so perhaps he told her that ) but ultimately she redeemed herself (more on that later.)

Drinks: My wife and I both ordered a mojito, even though it was pretty cold out.  Big mistake, and not just because of the weather.  The drinks were watery and the mint was wilting and brownish which made it seem like a large glass of rotting leaves.  But booze is booze and I could have overlooked this.

Menu: Coopers has what looks to be an incredible menu.  There were a number of items that sounded really good and I was already plotting my return voyage while I was making my choice.  But alas...

Appetizer: About four months ago I tried bone marrow for the first time at Graze and was absolutely blown away.  It was rich, decadent, and seemed to hold the very essence of beef in its silky embrace.  I don't know if Graze is just buying much better marrow bones or if their doing something in the preparation, but the marrow at Coopers was nothing like what I had at Graze.  It was flavorless and fatty, difficult to scoop out of the bone and disturbingly pink at points.  It came with only four small pieces of bread, so you had to slather an enormous amount on each one (which, by the way, so many restaurants do and i don't know why... bread is cheap.)

Speaking of bread-- I appreciated that the waitress warned us that the appetizer would take 20 minutes to prepare (although I wonder why this isn't written on the menu).  I would have appreciated it even more if she would have offered us some bread or something to munch on while we drained our watery mojitos.  As it turned out, Coopers has some really good baguettes.  In any case, all that is a minor complaint compared to...

The Entrees:

1. Pork Belly Mac and Cheese-
I ordered this one, and kind of liked the first bite.  But after two or three bites I just couldn't go in-- it was overwhelmingly sweet.  The pork belly sweetness would have been a good thing if it was offset by the sharpness of the cheddar.  But its not.  In fact, I'm not even sure that this was cheddar at all, though the menu claimed it was.  It tasted like the sweet ricotta filling that you get in a cannoli.  When my wife tried it she had the exact same experience.  She proclaimed the first bite to be \"delicious,\" then put down her fork after two more, gagging on the sweetness.   

2. Beef Stew on \"Dumplings\"
My wife ordered this.  It was terrible.  Really, really terrible.  A thin layer of spaetzle is not what I (or anyone) would expect by \"dumplings.\"  The beef looked like poop and didn't taste much better.

The Resolution:
The waitress came to the table when we had both eaten about 20% of our meal.  We said that we were finished and she asked if we would like our food wrapped up.  When we said no, she said that must be because we were so full.  No, I said.  The food just wasn't good.  She comped us for the entrees which was the right thing to do.

MEAL #2: Brunch

My parents were in town and we were looking for  a place to grab brunch before we left.  Again, everything on the menu looked really good.  Again, it really wasn't.  I ordered eggs benedict.  I don't know how you could possibly make a hollandaise sauce that ins't tasty, but Coopers managed it.  The corn beef hash my dad ordered was also just bizarre-- it looked like little shreds of corn beef and was garnished, rather bizarrely, with fruit.

The waiter was really fantastic and the atmosphere was nice, but once again the flavors just weren't there.

I highly doubt we'll be going back."}
{"text":"This is a review of the vegetarian offerings a Cooper's. I stopped in for a late morning brunch today and was surprised to find Cooper's was relatively empty. There was a soccer game on TV and a dozen fans sprinkled around the bar, but there were open tables galore. SCORE!

Vegetarian options here are pretty plentiful. Several vegan dishes are possible with a helpful waiter and some small tweaks. For veg heads:

Breakfast-y:
-breakfast sandwich (eggs, cheddar, spinach on english muffin)
-vegetarian scrambler (changes daily, today it was eggs and a combination of veggies and feta)
-oatmeal brulee (oats and apples with custard under a sweet crust)
-banana french toast (banana bread in a brown sugar custard served with maple syrup and fruit)
-granola

Lunch-y:
-hummus appetizer (beetroot hummus topped with olives, feta, chive oil, and crispy chickpeas served with lavash crackers)
-sweet potato chili (roasted sweet potatoes and black beans with chipotle, topped with dubliner cheddar, sour cream, and scallions. Comes with cornbread)
-several salads
-veggie sandwich (roasted zucchini, red peppers, carrots and portobello mushrooms on wheatberry bread with hummus, feta, and oven-dried tomatoes)
-grilled cheese

Today I got the sweet potato chili sans dairy toppings to make it vegan and it was really delicious. Spicy and super flavorful! I'll be back just to have a heaping bowl of the stuff. In the past I've gotten the veggie sandwich (very solid), and the hummus appetizer (great for sharing and lots of tasty items to nosh in the arrangement).

Overall I give Cooper's 4 out of 5 for veggie options at an omnivorous hangout. There are some solid ones, including a couple creative items like the oatmeal brulee. It would be fantastic to see a meat-free burger of some sort, but in the mean time Cooper's is doing a pretty good job."}
{"text":"Came to Cooper's Tavern with a group of five last week.  My friend and I were meeting the three others there. The other three hadn't arrived yet, and when the two of us came and asked for a table of five the guy seating us was like \"well okay, I guess you can take that table\".  We would have been fine sitting at the bar waiting for the rest of our party if he had told us to, but instead he sits us at the five-person table and then makes us feel really uncomfortable that we're sitting there.  He even came and asked us how much longer it was going to be until the rest of our party showed.  We were like \"um they're on their way, we just ordered drinks and appetizers...sorry?\"   Take into account that there were NO other parties waiting for a table at the time. Why are you making us feel unwelcome in your restaurant?  I think this guy might have even been the owner....middle-aged, Irish accent? Not sure.  Aside from this dude, the rest of our experience was alright.

Loved the ambiance of the place.  Granted we were at one of the large front tables and not in the tiny side tables that other reviews have mentioned.  Our waitress was super nice and helpful.  Everyone who asked for drink recommendations or food opinions were happy with what she had to say.  

The drink menu was fantastic.  Four full pages listing the beers they had.  My roommate was pumped that they had Hobgoblin which she had had in England over the summer.  And another friend was pleased with the hard ciders they carried (\"'tis the season!\")

The food was just \"meh\".  For an appetizer we had the cheese pretzels (why the cheese comes in a shot glass that is difficult to get out or dip anything in...I have no idea). Entree I had the fish and chips.  Nothing was bad, but nothing was great either. 

Go for the beer menu, not the food. And don't take any crap from that Irish man."}
{"text":"I just came home from an amazing meal at Coopers Tavern and feel that I've finally eaten here enough to not only give it a five star review, but also consider it my favorite restaurant on the square.

First of all, Coopers Tavern has great food. They serve one of my favorite burgers in Madison, which may not sound like much, but truthfully I've only found two places in Madison with burgers that are actually both tasty and worth the price (The other being Dotty's, of course). Other than that their cheese curds are amazing and their fish and chips are super good. I just came back from eating the steak frites and while I didn't love them quite as much as their burger, it was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. The seasonal vegetables(green beans, tonight) were delicious, and I could see myself ordering it again if I didn't want to try everything else on their menu.

Then we have the Brandy Old Fashioned. It is absolutely to die for. Seriously. No further comment needed.

Third and most importantly, the service here goes above and beyond all expectations. Our server tonight was Brie and she was absolutely warm and inviting from the get go. We ran into a problem with the fish and chips being a little bit too cold (not bad or anything, just a little cool) she did everything in her power to make sure we were taken care of and happy. Luckily all it took was throwing them in the deep fryer for a minute or two; we're not too difficult. The order of fish and chips was comped by the manager, but we would have honestly been happy and I still would have written this 5-star review either way just based off how great the service was.

Yes, the seating is a little cramped, but I've never had a problem hearing anyone in my party or with any other restaurant goers, so I certainly don't see it as a problem.


All in all, the food and service here are great and definitely worth every penny."}
{"text":"The beer and liquor selection is fantastic (5 stars) with a very inviting bar and dining area (4 stars). We just beat the dinner rush on a Thursday night with the dining room filling up by 6 pm. The food is just OK, really nothing that impressed us too much (3 stars). Overall, I will be back for the beer selection and fun Irish gastropub type atmosphere."}
{"text":"First the up side.  They have an amazing beer list, which features a wide range of styles, regions and tastes.  The server was attentive and responsive.  The item I ordered was a Cobb salad featuring corned beef, which turned out to be little more than an accent with about six very small cubes each measuring a quarter inch in diameter.  I guess I wrongly assumed that when you include a specific meat in the name of an entree salad, that it would have \"star billing\".   One of the other diners ordered a reuben sandwich and cup of reuben soup, each of which required no less than three beers to quash the residual salty taste.  I will probably take a chance at lunch, but if that is as unsatisfactory an experience, I will have no problem finding other places to patronize in downtown Madison."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was cramped and the service seemed kinda rushed but the food and the drink selection were decent. While I enjoyed the pork belly mac and cheese, I think the pork belly would probably be way too rich for most people. I think it's more of a bar than it is a restaurant and that might be OK for some but it was difficult for me to hold a conversation and have a relaxed dining experience here. I would maybe come back here for drinks or a quick bite, but maybe not for dinner again."}
{"text":"Myself and 2 friends were in town visiting for the first time. We checked out the State street area upon the advice of friends.

We came across Cooper's Tavern while looking for a place to eat and have a fee drinks. Sitting outside was a treat for mid-October and in the shadows of the state capitol was a bonus. 

The service left something to be desired it was our server's 2nd day on the job and the place was packed.

The food was excellent, the Reuben sandwich was delicious and they had an extensive list of both tap and bottled beers."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  I really really did.  We decided to visit after seeing that they had a unique take on different meals.  The service was okay and the prices were decent. The restaurant was very packed and a bit on the \"packed like sardines\" side.  The food was again just okay but I really expected more.  The beer selection was great.  Unfortunately, the deal breaker would be the mild food poisoning that the two out of the 3 of us received.  The other guest received a pretty bad case of it (they ordered the fish and chips fyi)  My suggestion would be to stick with the beer or not go at all."}
{"text":"I know it's just trying to be the Old Fashioned, but it does it pretty well. The food is generally pretty good, rich, fast, filling and casual. Brunch is surprisingly good, I especially enjoyed their holandaise sauce. 
   I've had a couple of misses from them, generally things like an untrained server, a menu item I just didn't care for their 'take' on, or being unable to find a seat sometimes and other times feeling like I've walked into a ghost-town bar. 
   Generally though the staff is friendly, the beer selection is decent, the food is classic midwestern comfort food meets scandanavian/germanic. 
    To sum up, a safe but unchallenging bet."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch and beer choices. Great gluten free menu and nice college town feel to this restaurant, a repeat for me."}
{"text":"The mussels due hour is their most distinctive and delicious menu item, but there are many great alternatives at fair prices. Both the bar and the restaurant tables are very popular in this great Capitol Square location. Hardwood floors and a plaster ceiling makes for a loud environment."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place on State Street or the Capitol square that has locally sourced ingredients and a decent beer selection, this is the place.  The service was friendly and the food was good.  I've gone here for lunch and dinner and was not disappointed.  There are televisions in the bar area if you want to watch a game.  It's a nice place to go with friends, even if it does feel a little cramped."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on the day after thanksgiving when all of our first choices were closed. We got in, and while seated right away, took 15 minutes and us asking the waitress 3 times before we even got water. The couple that came in 30 min after us got food and drinks before us. The service was poor, and slow. The food was just okay. 

Edited on 3/11/12 - gave it a second chance - raised it to 3 stars instead of two. This time is was much, much better service, but still 'good/okay' food. I do have to say, I was more impressed with the beer list this time. I'd consider going again for drinks."}
{"text":"Had only been in coopers for drinks which are awesome! Bartenders are friendly and offer a great selection of beer. Last time we were in here we were intrigued by the menu and made plans to come in and try the selections.

We went in last night around 9:00 for dinner. Started out with the pretzel appetizer. The pretzel was great however the Beer-Cheese sauce they served it with was lacking salt and balance. The sauce was extremely thin like it had sat in a heating well all day and broke down. 

Next we tried a bowl of their French Onion soup with gruyere and a side of mixed greens. We were a little confused why you would use fat tire from out of state when after all this is Wisconsin and we have tons of our very own local brews that fit. The soup came and we could smell that something had been scorched. Regardless we broke through the broiled cheese and dug in. It had good flavor but it finished with a bitter scorched taste...the same one we could smell. Little disappointing because Onions are cheap and every chef knows a good French Onion starts low and slow to get the perfect caramelization. The side salad was just spring mix with maybe a few drops of oil. 
Along with the soup we ordered a Veggie Platter. Not what we expected. It was 2 different types of hummus, along with 3 different pickled items. The beet hummus was what caught my eye first. Great taste but it looked like thickened Pepto on a plate...or something that comes out of Barneys mouth when he sneezes. The rest of the plate was average with Pickled Green beans, Pickled cabbage, frozen pita that was gently warmed and pickles. Not bad.

We each ordered an Entree. The beef stew with dumplings and pretzel crusted chicken. The Stew was the farthest from the description you could imagine. It was on a bed of spätzle that had been cooked long before served. The stew was tomato based with brussel sprouts and 2 small cubes of beef. Looked and tasted like it had sat in a heating well all day and reduced to a tomato paste with what resembled to once be chunks of vegetables that had been long past braised. Took one bite each and there we sat broken hearted.

Next the Pretzel Crusted Chicken with butternut squash hash and a whole grain mustard sauce. The hash was just diced butternut squash with no care to show knife skills and you guessed it....those damn brussel sprouts again. There was no salt or depth to the hash and I don't know what would classify it as a hash. The brussel sprouts were overcooked and brought back in a saute pan with oil and the squash.
The chicken was dipped in an egg wash and dredged with pieces of pretzel and panko. Then, sadly, it was deep fried. It was a good sized breast and it was moist, but way over- salted. The whole grain cream sauce was good and a good pair. The execution on the whole dish was lacking however.

The menu reminded me of bits and pieces of a few restaurants around town where I had seen these dishes before: Unami, Cadillac Ranch a.k.a Texas Tubbs West (RIP) and Brocach. The menu was intriguing and caught my eye but it had too many directions and was all over the board from Mediterranean to new American to Scottish. 


Cheers!!

P.S.- Our server was great!! However when the FOH manager was addressed with the problems we had she begrudgingly comp'd the entrees and soup; then put her coat on and left for the night. 

Don't worry we won't be returning."}
{"text":"4 of us stopped here before a play for dinner. The menu looked interesting and a bit creative online. We were seated promptly and our server was very friendly. Maybe she was new, but she was unable to answer some of our questions about the beverage and food menu. 
Our dinner was served in a timely manner. We all agreed, it was very average at best.  We decided to share some type of cheesecake dessert. It was definitely prepackaged and tasted like a refrigerator, yuk!  A cute place, but the food quality was just not there."}
{"text":"I love Cooper's Tavern and always have. I am disappointed to see that it does not have the same reputation that it used to on here because I do not feel that the quality has changed. 

Cooper's is consistent and predictable. When I go there, I know that I will be seated quickly, have an attentive server and eat a solid meal. This last time I went, I ordered the pretzel as an appetizer, the Amy salad with grilled chicken and my boyfriend had the fried chicken sandwich. 

The pretzel was a little burnt on the top, but the sauces that were served on the side made up for it. I would recommend asking for both the beer cheese and mustard sauce -- They are both worth trying. 

My salad was yummy and pretty filling but not over the top. The goat cheese medallions that came on the side were delicious! Finally, my boyfriend finished his fried chicken sandwich before I could even ask for a bite. So, I cannot personally speak on behalf of that sandwich, but based on his consumption, I would imagine it was delicious! 

Go here! Do not let the reviews deter you. The brunch is also always great and they have some of my favorite Bloody Mary's in Madison (that come with a shot of Hopalicious)."}
{"text":"I had a pleasant experience at Cooper's Tavern. I was with three other people and was seated right away. 
The food was delicious. We got two appetizers (beer cheese pretzels and croquettes) and it was a good choice since both appetizers didn't have a lot of food with them. 
I had the sliders for my main course and it was the perfect size. I was stuffed by the end of the meal. 
The overall experience was ok. It is very dark and REALLY loud, but they had a nice selection of food and drinks and everyone seemed to be content."}
{"text":"I didn't get to try the food but I loved the beer selection. I've been meaning to try the stuff out of Surly's and this was my first chance. Pro-tip: have a few and go wander around inside the state capitol building. It's just outside, quite beautiful, and is extra nice with a buzz."}
{"text":"I had a chance to grab lunch here earlier today and let me say that I am a fan. It has a homey feel, staff is very friendly and the turkey sandwich, while not the best and a bit overpriced, was decent enough. The biggest pro is the down to earth environment and the alcohol selection. One con: They had a soccer game on the TV. 

I'd definitely give this place a go, though. Especially at night or during a big sports game."}
{"text":"Love Cooper's location and the outdoor seating under the tree. Can't really ask for much more than that on a nice day.  The hubby and I ordered the bone marrow and the cheese plate to start with. I'm not one for bone marrow, but he said it was good.  The blue and one of the cheddars on the cheese plate were great, but another cheddar on there didn't taste like a whole lot. The honey drizzled on the plate was heavenly though.

He got the grilled cheese with a shot of tomato/pepper soup, and I had the lobster mac and cheese. The grilled cheese was yummy but the bread is just cut too thick. The soup was really well balanced and had a nice roasty flavor.  The lobster mac and cheese was pretty good, and they do not skimp on the lobster meat at all, but for $20 I would have thought I would get more than a little pot of the mac and cheese. Though, I ended up leaving stuffed between all the food and the beer, so overall it was a pretty good place to grab a meal."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  I've only been there twice, but both times were excellent.  Food was great and very reasonably priced.  The beer selection is huge, but I have only been there for lunch time and did not imbibe.  Overall, the atmosphere is very relaxing and best suited for grabbing one or two friends for a casual drink or meal.  Definitely a good addition to the downtown eatery scene.  I didn't see any room for large groups."}
{"text":"Not a big coffee drinker, but the coffee rubbed beef special had a hint of breakfast in every bite. It was great to take Amanda to Coopers for our our last date! Next time we will come it'll be just for dinner, since we'll be married. Although the beer selection left out a few Wisconsin favorites, we still plan on coming back for the main course. That bone marrow butter is top notch! Amanda had the steak and frites. Might have been more enjoyable with a fancier potato option but none the less the steak was perfect as expected."}
{"text":"Yum! I definitely enjoyed my brunch here this afternoon. I had the salmon lok and it was damn delicious. Anything with smoked salmon on it I have to try, and I am so glad I did. It came on toast with cream cheese and capers. Very yummy. My girlfriends tried the Coopers Burger and the French Onion soup and said it hit the spot. Decent service for the most part, and the food came out quickly, which I always like!

It was a nice enough day so we ate on the patio. I didn't get much of a chance to check out the inside, but I would like to see more of it next time. I like that this place is a little bit off state street because its close enough that you can be part of the party, but also not in the way of anyone. You don't have to deal with drunk people stumbling around your food or too much noisiness. They have cute flower decorations on the tables as well as candles."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go to on the square! It's a short 5 minute walk from my apartment so I've been here a good number of times already. I love the beer list - with my favorite being the Monk's sour beer (not the full name of the beer but my memory is terrible - sorry!). The food has been a bit hit or miss for me and I do sometimes wish there were some more options. It's more of a comfort food menu (e.g. grilled cheese, reuben, mac & cheese, etc.) but sadly without the option of cheese curds! The upstairs is great and if it is open - I would definitely recommend going up there. I also love that this is a go-to place for any soccer games including the world cup, English premier league, & Spanish premier league! It's always great to connect & cheer on with other fans :). Finally, in my experience, the service (including hosts as well) here has been phenomenal. Very attentive & knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Being a bit of a food snob this place sets the bar high and takes it higher. Service, food and beers is off the charts. Locally and independently owned (owner bought us a drink). They use 70 plus vendors with most being local. It is a must stop when in Madison. I highly recommend the Reuben and sweet potato chili. I will be back for sure. Cheers to a great meal and better time!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of The Cooper's Tavern is great. Relaxed but feels like your going to get great food and service. Well the service was good. We were seated quickly and had our food and drinks delivered quickly. But our server didn't come around after our entrees were served so there was not opportunity to ask for any additionals or corrections. The food was okay too. Not stellar but not terrible either. Everything was just rather bland. I had today's special of sirloin served with fresh veggies over a sweet potato purée. My guest has the chick sandwich and chips. All of it was just rather blah. Again, not terrible but not really flavorful either. Over all I'm giving 3 stars because the drinks came quickly and the atmosphere was chill."}
{"text":"I'm new to Madison and was hoping to find \"my\" bar; I think that this is it.  

I didn't try thee food but the couple next to me enjoyed the appetizer they were eating.

The bartender was very nice and let me have a taste test of a stout when I asked how it compared to Guinness."}
{"text":"I don't normally leave reviews, but I feel as though I'm performing a community service by urging others to avoid this place.

The beer selection:  It certainly seems robust, except for the fact that what you want is nearly guaranteed to have \"just run out.\"  Nowhere else in town do I find it necessary to pick 3 beers when I sit down just to ensure they will actually have what I want stocked.

The food... yikes.  Well it's not cheap, for one thing.  Sandwiches run about 10 dollars each and come with only a small amount of (what looks like your standard grocery store bagged) spring mix greens or chips.  Frites are an option, for an extra $2 (!!!).  The standard dipping sauce for the fries is a malt vinegar aioli, which had the exact aftertaste of spoiled milk and received universally negative reviews from my dining companions.  Let's get to the main events:

My first entree was the pork belly mac.  
Plating:  Messy, no appealing colors or garnish.  Pork belly was splash of dark on the light colored mac.  Boring.

The pork belly:  An incredibly small amount for $14, and ALL fat--no thin strip of delicious bacony meat as you'd normally expect.  It was also burned (properly cooked it's crisp, not charcoal) on both sides but lukewarm and gelatinous on the inside.  

The mac:  Sauce was awful.  The dubliner cheddar in the sauce made for a grainy texture with very little flavor.  In fact at many times the dominant taste was flour... someone evidently needs to work on their roux.  You can't be making such a sub par cheese sauce in the CAPITAL OF WISCONSIN.  C'mon.

My next visit, I got the chicken sandwich.
The chicken:  Rubbery on the inside, tough on the outside but with no sear whatsoever on this \"pan-seared\" chicken.  I'm not even sure how to achieve this texture... steaming? Microwaved?

The bread:  Toasted sourdough.  Half inch thick slices of hard, toasted bread saturated with butter or some kind of oil.  The thickness of the bread made it very difficult to eat.  Diagonal slices, please.  The roof of my mouth thanks you in advance.

The accoutrements:  While technically there, the bacon, avocado, butter lettuce and cheddar toppings were not present in sufficient quantity to contribute anything to the taste of the sandwich, really unfortunate; it was this combination of toppings that actually drew me to the sandwich.  The chipotle mayo added a nice hint of smokiness, and was the only positive part of the experience.

DESPITE the truly mediocre food, the service has been fantastic here every time I've gone.  The servers seem genuinely apologetic about the food and very knowledgeable about the beers they DO have that might be SIMILAR to what I actually wanted.

Suffice to say, I likely won't go back here again.  Maybe, just maaaybe for a beer if I'm joining friends, but when it comes to food you can do MUCH better literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"Great food - we really enjoyed \"Amy's Salad\" and the pork and mac 'n cheese.  The service and beer selection were great!  It was VERY noisy - perhaps they could add some noice absorbing bumpers on the wall - or artwork?"}
{"text":"Darn good food! Smaller restaurant, so plan accordingly. A couple of times we wanted to eat here, but it was too busy. We always have a plan B restaurant in mind, just in case."}
{"text":"This is my favorite public house in Madison! If you're looking for a fun place, full of light, laughter, and good craic, this is the place to visit. The service is top-notch and on my first visit, my server, Devlin knew their menu and could offer help for this first-timer to the Sconnie Egg and Poutine and a great Guinness. On the second visit, we had the tasty Coopers Burger and fresh mixed greens. On my third visit, I came only for the Guinness and the craic. The evening bar crew are great to visit with, and the weary business travelers who filtered in after a hard day's conferencing brought a welcome bit of diversity. Next day, I was in for fish 'n chips, which thanks to Travis, I got Cooper's first batch of the day! Crunchy perfection surrounds tender fish loins, perched atop a bed of crispy fries (with just enough cole slaw to keep a fella from feeling too guilty), all washed down with hearty Guinness pints.  On my last visit today, I met the proprietor, Peter, who took the time to \"hook me up\" (I was writing and my pad was in need of a charge-up) and have a brief chat before the noon crowd cut that short.

I'm from the South and don't often find such hospitality when I travel north of the Mason-Dixon Line. The Coopers Tavern is the place for it in Madison! (We visited Madison late May/early June 2018.)

P. S. Their T-shirts are boss! Don't leave without one."}
{"text":"I heard great things about it, but it was only ok for me. I had a chicken sandwich and it wasn't terrible, but the chicken was clearly processed. It is also VERY noisy inside. However my wife really liked her salad and they have a good beer selection."}
{"text":"Cooper's is a solid choice for downtown, Capitol area dining. 

You can't get your name on the list until all of your party is there, at least that's how it was for us tonight. It was pretty busy on Wednesday around 6:45 pm. The server was friendly and attentive, but he didn't refill waters for us until the very end of our meal. The feel and the energy in the place is fun and lively. The salmon was perfect, and you can get the Brussel sprouts sautéed in veggie oil rather than bacon fat if that's more of what you prefer. The prices aren't cheap, and the dishes aren't \"light,\" but taste and quality are up there, and when you can sit outside in the summer, it's a really sweet dining spot. 

I've enjoyed the cheese curds in the past, but tonight they were lukewarm, and that was unfortunate because we brought someone from out of town who was trying them for one of her first times. Overall, if I'm eating out downtown, I'm never against eating at Cooper's. I realize I pointed out some low points in Cooper's, but I stand by my 4-star rating on this place for all of its other upsides."}
{"text":"Thank you, kind bartender, for humoring my request for a hot, non-alcoholic drink at the bar. I swear I did not mean to leave my ID back at my hotel room. 

It was 8PM and I had already done all my research on all the bars in the vicinity of the Madison Concourse hotel. So I decided that I wanted to start my tavern hopping adventure right with a beer and pretzeled bread at The Cooper's Tavern. It wasn't until I had walked in and sat myself down at the bar that I realized that I only had a credit card and some cash in my pocket...and I wasn't about to trek back out into the cold back to my hotel room to get my ID because I knew that if I made it back to my king-sized bed and flatscreen TV, I would never make it back outside. 

SO, long story short, I ended up sipping a hot chocolate (from powder) while I waited for my pretzeled bread, pretending to be interested in whatever soccer game was playing on the TVs behind the bar. Good thing I was impressed with the pretzeled bread (I actually had a random craving for that and spicy mustard earlier last week), or I would have been a very, very unhappy camper. Sad to say, my tavern hopping adventures ended with my last drop of hot-chocolate. However, I'm glad that I made Cooper's my first stop! 

Nice try Sherry, maybe next time."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday night without reservations and only waited 20 minutes. The little wait was SO worth it because we were seated in the mini private room - complete with western swing doors and a personal server window via the bar! Super fun twist to a seemingly normal dinner. 

I had the mussels and was quite surprised by the size and quality! A full dinner plate of fresh mussels, all decently sized in medium sized shells, in a light sauce topped with fries and bread. Delicious. 

I definitely will be back the next time I'm in Madison!"}
{"text":"Went to Cooper's Tavern for lunch.

First stop, went to the bar to grab a tap IPA, bar tender was cool so I decided to eat at the bar. 

Main reason I went to Cooper's, I was on a buisness trip and was craving cheese curds. I had lived in Madison before, but never made it to Cooper's Tavern. So, I ordered cheese curds. Yum, tasty little bites. House made ranch was mm good. I love it when some thought goes into the dipping sauce.

Next up was a Cooper's Burger. Aged cheddar cheese, bacon, and that meat... it was delicious. Cooked to a perfect medium-well. Left satisfied, will be back."}
{"text":"I go to Cooper's Tavern about once a week with a friend, and we always order the same thing. I am in love with their corn caesar salad, harvest soup, and frites. As for the service, it is not great. The past few times I've gone the server lacks enthusiasm or forgets to bring us our drinks. Overall, I would recommend Cooper's though for their food!"}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch, and I was rather pleased.

I was impressed with the beer list, not just for its selection of local and Belgian beers (which seem to be ubiquitous in Madison), but for the other not so common finds (an homage to eastern Europe and the Pacific for example) and what I would call American staples (Anchor Steam, Founder's, and Unibroue - notice I said American).

As far as food goes - my ladyfriend and I had the harvest soup, which was quite good. I had the turkey sandwich with apple-pear slaw and thousand island dressing, and she had the chicken sandwich on sourdough. We both felt that the turkey sandwich won that fight, it was excellent. The rest of the menu sounds great, especially dinner. The penchant for pork products is nice to see.

View of the capital is really nice. Interior is clean and modern. I liked the light wood bar. Service was great, but the place wasn't exactly bustling. 

I held off on giving 5 stars, because it seems like this place has a bit of evolving to do yet. Still kind of new/green, and not a particularly original menu (kind of a mix between The Old Fashioned and Brasserie V). I am definitely coming back for dinner though."}
{"text":"This place was pleasantly surprising.  The fries and the aioli really stick out in my mind because they were THAT good.  Order them.  I ate the fish sandwich (I was there on Friday), and it was delicious but pretty impossible to eat as a sandwich.  Just give me the fish on the plate!  If you insist on the bread, give me a roll or three and I'll be happy.  I wasn't really upset about anything, but I did find it mildly hilarious that I had to strategize (repeatedly) about each course of action I took before a bite.

The beer selection is decent, though other places have it better.  The atmosphere is nice.  I sat at the bar, and while the bartender was good at his job, he came out on the ass end of my opinion when the back of house screwed him with REALLY slow service.  It was lunchtime, but it wasn't so busy so as to justify 15 minutes passing (along with a pint of beer) before fries arrived.  I'm generally laid back about things, but I'm honest when I write these things and it sucked having to wait so long for the fries.  I don't really blame the bartender either, though he seemed oblivious that we had waited that long until a minute before they came out.  He gave us the, \"your fries will be right up\" line, which did not resonate well with me at the time and I remember saying something to my girlfriend that was less-than-friendly but pretty damn funny at the same time.  It was my coping mechanism.

So, there you have it.

Great fries, impossible sandwich, annoyingly slow service.  

I'll admit that things may improve the next time I go there.  I'm a big fan of probability and the place seems like one that I want to go back to.  I wasn't bowled over though."}
{"text":"Stopped in here one Wednesday night after ringing bells for the Salvation Army at the Capitol square Walgreens for two hours in the cold and rain.  It was crowded as always, but that's a sign of a great place worth waiting for; right? Right!! We were greeted immediately, seated within two minutes by some eye candy of a waiter (they were allll cute and I love being served by a man;always so sweet) 
I ordered my first \"hot toddy\" of the season and it was absolutely delish and unfroze my fingertips from bell ringing.  We were going to get appetizer but decided to get the stuffed French chicken breast with mushroom risotto and it was the best I've ever had. I would take friends here, a first date, a gal pal ... Just perfect in every way. 
Thanks Cooper's!"}
{"text":"This place is a little bit underwhelming for the amount of time one has to wait to get a seat.  The beer selection is nice, but the food is really medicore.  The descriptions always sound really good, but then you get the food and it's just meh.  Compared to the other restaurants that you find around the square, Cooper's Tavern just doesn't hold a candle."}
{"text":"Cooper's never disappoints.  Great bar staff.  Always kept our drinks full.  Cheese curds were on point.  The jalapeño mule was a surprising favorite.  Has an awesome bite that sneaks up on you at the end.  Always be sure to stop here when I come to Madison."}
{"text":"I love Cooper's - the food, the staff, the owner - but i have two peoblems with it.

1. The menu is very good but never changes.  I work practically next door to the place but i would visit now often if they would change the menu occasionally.  I doubt there had been more than a couple of changes in the last 4 years. 

2.  The noise. Hard walks and floors and a crowded room make it impossible to be heard on a Friday or Saturday night. 

P.S.  Really great fries!"}
{"text":"Pros: Cool atmosphere. Great beer/drink selection. Fun location.

Cons: We waited forever for a table. There's no good waiting space. We ordered a cheese plate and it was sooooo sad. The presentation was terrible. Our friend ended up with a terrible case of food poisoning from their Flank Steak \"special\".

I like this place for the drinks and their patio is lovely when the weather is good. But...I don't think I'll ever return for the food."}
{"text":"Really love the place.   The Coopers Burger is a great lunchtime meal and if you are into soccer or World sports, this is the place to be.   This is the usual hangout for Liverpool FC fans in Madison."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Awesome food. We got to sit in the private room and enjoy friends' company. Great food and drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped here a couple of times for lunch.  Seating can be a bit limited, crowded, too.  Service was decent, had the beef sandwich, portion sizes were reasonable and the food was quite good.  Definitely recommend and will be back.

hint:  sit at the front window bar stools for faster seating, a view of the Capitol, and good people watching"}
{"text":"My favorite bar at the moment. Vanilla java porter is liquid candy in a bottle, mmmm. Definitely go upstairs if it's open."}
{"text":"I've been here twice: once a packed Saturday night and once a lazy Sunday afternoon. On both occasions I thought the food and service were fine. I have no complaints, but also nothing incredible to report. To be honest, the only reason I came back the second time was because I couldn't get in to Cento. It wasn't my first choice, but there were no terrible memories holding me back either.

The one thing that bugs me is that they tout having locally made bread and locally made beer, but then serve you butter from Ireland. Hello?"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, disappointed in the food. We came here expressly for the chips (my wife's sole goal), but they were so burnt we literally couldn't eat them. Thankfully, the order was misinterpreted  and we didn't get an extra side order of chips with our (very tasty) wee burgers...

UPDATE (7/8/11): Coopers has righted this terrible wrong and are now, once again, making tasty pub chips!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, bar needs a little help. Only has a menu of liquors the bar stocks, no cocktails or suggestions. I was looking for a whiskey cocktail with cherry and honey, they dint know how to put anything together. On a good note, our waitress, Breann was fantastic! Bent over backwards to find a drink we'd like and though the bar staff did not hit their mark she more than made up for it."}
{"text":"So...Cooper's Tavern, the new Food Fight Restaurant....

My husband and I went here for dinner on a Monday evening.  It was threatening to rain, so we opted to sit inside.  The sidewalk seating looks like it would be really enjoyable on nicer days, though.  

There was live celtic music, a group of 4 people playing their instruments in the back.  It really reminded of the celtic bars I frequented when I used to live in Brittany, France.  The volume of the music was just right- loud enough to notice, but not so loud that you had to shout to have a conversation.

Our waitress was prompt, but she forgot to tell us the specials, one of which was Mussels and fries, which I would have ordered had I known about them.  I ordered the grilled cheese and house salad; husband had the lamb sandwich and home made chips.  The grilled cheese was good and the salad mix was fresh.  I tasted the chips and thought they could be better.  They were on the dry and bland side.  (Maybe use peanut oil for frying and some more salt?)  My husband liked his lamb sandwich.

This would probably be a 3 star review, as it's a run-of-the-mill Food Fight restaurant, but the huge and interesting beer menu and live music give it the fourth star."}
{"text":"Coopers is first and foremost for me a bar. They serve food, and good food, but what they excel at is a great and varied beer list. Ive had good salads and frites there so I would recommend it for a date or night out with friends.

The downstairs is long and narrow and when its a weekend it can be difficult to drink there if you cannot sit at the bar. The upstairs is spacious and offers great views of the capital.

Outside seating also makes it a attractive place to go in the warmer months."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant and bar! Wonderful service, great food, hip and interesting menu and decor. Love it."}
{"text":"Drinks were nice.  Food was good.  Except for the pub chips.  They were burnt.  Burnt.  Not crispy, but more... unpleasantly dark, as it were."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep trying. It's like the substandard relationship that won't quit. 

Their beer selection is outstanding. The decor is good. The service is alright. But the food, on the three occasions I've had it, has been very disappointing. I would not recommend the pretzel breadsticks, the reuben (salty and dry), or the poutine (neither authentic or good). I did like the pork belly mac and cheese, although I, for the first time in my life, ate *around* the pork belly once I tasted it. I didn't actually know that pork belly could be prepared in a manner that I wouldn't like. So at least it is an educational experience.

Lesson: Stick to the beers. And maybe a scotch egg. That thing is kinda good."}
{"text":"We probably won't come back here for dinner, but definitely for drinks. Great selection and very cheap! (well, to us from the Bay Area ...) I really loved the Fox Barrel Pear Blackberry cider and Derek loved the New Glarus Raspberry.

We started off with the pretzels + beer cheddar dip ... How was that so bland? But indeed, it was, and completely unforgettable.

Derek got a burger and I got a grilled veggie sandwich. Pretty yummy but not special. We left still hungry, but at least a little tipsy!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Ca and not having the tavern/pub atmosphere, I have become a big fan. I loved The Cooper Tavern.  We had the Duck Wings and Kobe Sliders which both were awesome. We were disappointed the soft pretzels had not been delivered for the day so we didn't get to try them. Our server Chaz was nice but was just to busy visiting with the bartender and didn't spend enough time with his tables."}
{"text":"I've been for brunch couple of times, and the experience was nothing to write home about at best, or just bad.

Pros: 
-Staff is extremely nice, has a good sense of humor
-Great beer selection
-Bloody Marys are good, reasonably priced
Large, well-placed TV screens

Cons:
-Service was slow - my friend's mimosa was comped because it took so long to get
-We were near the end of brunch (I think), and there were three different menu items that we wanted, that they had run out of. If you don't have it, let us know before we make up our minds to order
-The Steak & Eggs were cold within a couple of minutes, the steak was tough, and the sauce tasted strangely chlorine-y (or soap-y?). They had run out of their duck-fat eggs, and for $15 the dish was bland
-Coffee was mediocre, had to flag the server down for a refill"}
{"text":"The highlight of coopers for me are always the specials. For example the beer mac and cheese that was on special because of beer week was fantastic. What sets this mac and cheese apart from seemingly similar dishes at The Old Fashioned or The Great Dane? At Coopers they take it over the top with the inventive ingredients. It starts with a stout gruyere cheese sauce. Next comes mushrooms, spinach, sun dried tomatoes and topped with still more gruyere. The only reason I didn't give Coppers 5 stars was because If I look at the meal as a whole the frites where a little under seasoned relying heavily on the malt vinegar aioli."}
{"text":"I thought it would be a great place to not eat too much \"carb\"age when I looked at the menu. The Reuben has a tiny bit of corned beef with two HUGE pieces of bread. The harvest soup was supposed to come with blue cheese,
Which they gave me more when I asked for more. If you have a crappy palate, you'll like this place. They are all about that bread, that bread."}
{"text":"I was meeting some friends here before the Garbage concert.  I walked in and there are plenty of seats that Sunday.   So I snag a table while I waited.  My friends were late but my server made sure I was comfortable.  The TV had the Packer game on and I had the One Barrel Brewing's Bilbo Baggins in my hand, so I was okay.  The crowd started rolling in about 15 minutes after I sat down.  I was glad I got there before the rush.

When the friends arrived, our server was helpful and quick with our orders.  I ordered the burger.  It was juicy and seasoned well.  I really enjoy having my choice of greens, frites, or house made chips.  I chose the greens and it was a perfect accompaniment to the flavorful burger.

My friends had the burger and the special.  The special that day was a chicken bacon ranch sandwich on a pretzel bun.  She said it was really good.  We were all very satisified with our choices.  We got done in time to hope in line for our show.

I have been here once or twice before and have enjoyed myself.  I like the beer menu, it is full of wonderful choices and it's hard to pick just one.  I will continue to come and try new things.  The Mussels are calling me next time!"}
{"text":"So, I ate here last night as part of the Madison Fair Share fundraiser dinner and my group was very excited. We paid $50 for our tickets which included 3 courses - each paired with a beer from One Barrel Brewing. What could be better than a menu that is hand crafted from local ingredients that were grown and brewed around Madison, right? Well, unfortunately for us it was a huge disappointment. 

We had an appetizer that consisted of shredded cucumber, a rich buttery sauce, and nice pieces of bread. Very delicious and refreshing.

The first course was braised rabbit served on a bed of RPs fettuccine with a creamy mushroom and beer sauce. This was really delicious, especially whatever crispy things they put on top. The only complaint is that it was, at best, lukewarm when we received it. The beer was very delicious - an American Pale Ale.

The second course was where things went wrong. Strangely enough, they served us salad after the main course. It consisted of a pile of pickled vegetables, including pickled morel mushrooms, rhubarb, radish, and asparagus. It was served on a bed of greens with an ipa vinaigrette. Now, I was very excited about this dish at first - I LOVE pickled stuff. I thought the idea of pickled morels was very exciting and interesting. Unfortunately, everything about the dish was absolutely overwhelming and rather cringe worthy. The vinaigrette mixed with the pickling brine made our eyes water, the anise was confusing and disgusting (admittedly, this may be a personal preference, but we all disliked it), and the greens were overshadowed by all of this. I wish this had been A. served before the main dish, B. had fewer pickles OR a less intense vinaigrette, and C. had more greens to even it all out. The beer with this one was also a loser for us - but we don't like IPA, so that is hard to gauge. 

The third and final course was a dessert consisting of a strawberry and rhubarb sauce, a key-lime curd, and a rather odd white puffy thing resembling a cham tort. None of us finished it. It was insanely sweet, the white puffy thing was kind of gross, and it was just not satisfying. The beer served with this was really rather ghastly as well - it was a wheat beer and it seriously tasted like cigarette ash. We each managed to take 2 or 3 sips to try and figure out what it was we were tasting, but after that couldn't take another drink. I would rather drink budweiser or old milwaukee, which is just about the worst insult I can give to a beer.

Final comments: I had a really delicious old fashioned (brandy, sweet), and the service was really great. The wait staff were really on top of things, and the owner was out there busting his butt, too. I will consider going back for their regular food some day, I just hope this poorly executed menu was a fluke rather than the norm. In the end, it helped support a group I think is doing really great things and I am happy I did it, I just wish it had been a little better."}
{"text":"this place has the some of the best steak frites i ever had. it definitely beat some i  had in California! the meat is just right, not over cooked nor undercooked! with the steamed veggies it just balanced out the! however the fries were very very salty. if anyone come to Madison for  vacation or just stay around for a few days, this is one restaurant you do not want to miss out. 

ps: 2nd floor has a nice view of the state capital because it is right across from it!"}
{"text":"cool place, food was ok... not great not terrible. Mussells were bland, despite the waitress doing a great job explaining how they are prepared... that cool egg , wrapped in meat and deep fried was fun, different and the mustard sauce was special.. we are a larger group so tried a lot... pretzel sticks were tasty.. service fair.. almost got 3 stars but not quite, and i would not rush back...."}
{"text":"We came for breakfast after the farmers market.  Food was excellent and beer selection was great.  Good service.  Good stop after shopping!"}
{"text":"Pork Belly Mac. Best thing on the menu. Great beer selection too. The mussels are good too!

The place is always busy and takes no reservations. The upstairs room has never been open when we go, don't know of anyone else has had that experience."}
{"text":"This bar is gorgeous!  In my two months here so far, this is my favorite in Madison and I've been to quite a few.  The servers are very nice, the menu is amazing and did I mention this place is gorgeous!  

Sadly, the only reason I cannot give Cooper's five stars is because my food today was just too greasy-I ordered the breakfast sandwich and the \"English muffin\" was nothing of the sort.  It was very greasy, with two greasy eggs and a slice of cheese. The side salad was boring, tasteless and plopped on the plate in a giant mess of a heap.  I have to say I would not order this dish again.  However, my husband's vegetarian scrambler with wheat toast and potatoes was pretty delicious.  I'll get that next time:)"}
{"text":"The cheese curds are awesome!! The house made ranch is very good and goes so well with them. 

The beer list is on point - lots of great selection. 

The waitress we had was great, very nice but didn't bother us with unnecessary chatter. Kept it professional and to the point. 

Solid spot"}
{"text":"Having worked on the square for years, Cooper's was always a spot that I could go grab lunch, appetizers and drinks after work or dinner. We stopped in here last night for an early dinner, as my boyfriend and I were still downtown after work.

To start, I always order the Frites as an appetizer. I love the malt vinegar aioli that comes with it. The fries were crispy, aioli delicious and the presentation on point (they have the paper cone now branded with the Cooper's Tavern name).

For dinner, my boyfriend went with the Coopers Burger and I decided to try something completely different and ordered the Grilled Cheese. I would normally never ever order something as basic as a grilled cheese in a restaurant, but wanted to give it a shot (no pun intended as it includes a shot of harvest tomato soup).  More on that in a minute. 

I loved that it was served on sourdough bread, and that there was a mix of cheese both cheddar and herbed goat cheese. The cheddar was oozing out of the bread and the goat cheese was spread on the bread. This was a nice contrast and worked well to upgrade what you would think would be a basic grilled cheese. On the side they served a shot of harvest tomato soup. This was also just as good. I have a hard time loving tomato soup, mainly because I always associate it with the flavorless and thin canned options. But this was a little thicker and did the trick to dip the grilled cheese in.

On the side I ordered the chips, which I could do without. You can also order a salad in its place, but I typically have salads for lunch. I ended up taking half my sandwich home, slapped my boyfriends hand away when he tried to have a bite, and ate the rest later as we had such an early dinner.

Regarding service, we actually came at a slow time for Cooper's. We were seated quickly, service was good, and we were in and out in no time. The one thing I would say about Cooper's is they do have a limited menu. But, they cover pretty good ground in appetizers, salads, entrees and sandwiches.

If you can, ask to sit in the Snug. Also, the outside area has changed from what they used to have for seating. It's more of a picnic table style, which I understand is probably easier for service and you probably can seat more people out there. But, I preferred the rounds."}
{"text":"Coopers used to be my #1 recommendation for anyone visiting Madison. I'm not sure what happened, but for the past few months the great dining experience that once was the experience of Coopers has been replaced with a mediocre experience. Food quality has dropped and across-the-board friendly, prompt and competent service is now hit or miss."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, and it was pretty good! I love that they have wheat on all the tables, such a nice Midwestern touch.

I tried the sliders and the beer cheese pretzels. Sliders come on pretzel buns and (presumably house-made) chips. really tasty! The pretzels are exactly what they sound like.

Nothing totally mind blowing, but certainly a fine option. They also have a nice beer list, and the server I had was super friendly,"}
{"text":"It's been a few visits since my first time at The Cooper's Tavern, and I'm continually so very pleased! The atmosphere inside is always warm and welcoming, and I always get a cozy, laid-back vibe when dining there. On my most recent visit, I tried the Chicken Cobb salad. It was presented well, with each topping making a little stripe over the top of the greens, which underneath were coated with a creamy garlic dressing. The dressing tasted great and was just the right amount -- it didn't leave the greens soggy or anything thankfully! I'd definitely order this salad again, however I think I'd skip the red onions since they were suuuuuper strong and I ended up having to pick them out because I couldn't handle them!

All in all, Cooper's is wonderful and they have many items on their menu that I can't wait to try out in future visits!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a casual dinner and the food was terrific.  I had fish and chips.  Great, crispy fish, perfect fries and delicious coleslaw.  Spouse loved the mussels.   The carrot cake for dessert was tasty and unique.  Good wine by the glass.  Service was good.   The place is a little noisy but I think the food is some of the best in Madison."}
{"text":"Great concepts, execution is off. Poached eggs were hard boiled, missing the gooey yellow goodness inside. Steak under seasoned. Duck drummies were fantastic, but served with greasy greens. Stick with drinks and apps and you'll be ok."}
{"text":"Met some friends for dinner/drinks before concert! 
Thought the place would be a mad house due to college graduation weekend.
Nicely surprised to have a hopping place, but not loud and crazy wait times, etc.
Place had a great selection of beers.  We enjoyed a couple different options!
Dinner... I had a hankering for chicken!
So I had the \"airline chicken\".  (Can't remember the exact name of the dish, but the description calls it airline chicken)
Was a beautiful spinach stuffed chicken breast with a flavorful crust.  Not like a breaded crust but a seared chicken skin type thing... YUM!
The chicken was served on a very nice risotto with white wine (?) cream sauce!!!
Would come back here for the chicken and great selection of beers!
Hubs had the fish and chips.  He enjoyed it.
Since my meal was so satisfying and big, I didn't sample it.

I like everything about this place!
Service, beer selection, food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on a Sunday afternoon for a burger.  They had their brunch menu, which was somewhat limited if you weren't looking for breakfast food.  We tried the Beer Cheese Pretzel for an app.  The pretzel was great and came with two sauces.  The beer cheese sauce was delicious!  I would recommend.

For my entree, I went with the Cooper Burger.  The beef tasted good but it wasn't a very big patty.  The brioche bun was the perfect choice for the.  Overall, it was a solid burger."}
{"text":"Despite being known for it's pub status, I actually enjoy the food more than the brews at this locale. When it comes to brews, I'm partial to the Magner's Pear Cider, an Irish specialty, since it's hard to find and also quite delicious.

I've been for dinner and brunch, and both have tasty food offerings. For dinner, I got the polenta and we sat outside. The entrees were all pretty stellar and the atmosphere was equally superb with the capitol lit up in the background.

When we went for brunch, I got the sweet potato chili and the poutine benedict, both with their own quirks. First, the sweet potato chili was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy for a mid-morning fix. I secretly wished that I had just ordered a bowl of that for my meal, until the poutine came. The poutine benedict offered a unique, vegetarian spin on a dish that is normally drenched in gravy. Instead, this place throws two poached eggs on top and drizzles hollandaise over the fries. Genuis!

The place is great for any occasion, but personally I'd recommend brunch for your first time."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning. I had the eggs Benedict. Yummy, but had to send it back once because my eggs had runny whites. Yuck! The second time around they were perfect. Yummy! Ham too thick, but still tasty. Super yummy homemade english muffin. Rustic to say the least."}
{"text":"I usually love this restaurant. Tonight though, the kids' meals left much to be desired. The skewered chicken, while abundant, was very dry. My daughter tried to eat it. 

I guess I thought my Brussels sprouts salad would be a warm addition of pan seared sprouts. It was only okay. 

At least we started with my fav, the frites with the vinegar mayo. Love. Love. Love. 

I think the kids meals need work. My kids won't want it again. 

Service was excellent as always."}
{"text":"The place filled up fast. It has a unique interior look. We ordered soup and sliders and asked for it all to come together. We got the sliders but then soup was about 10 mins behind. The sliders were awesome.  I can't say the same about the soup though. The service was ok. I thought the prices were on the high side. It wasn't Ooo ah and it wasn't yuck, so I rated them right in the middle."}
{"text":"This place is truly a gem next to the Capitol. 

I have been there three times with my wife and every time we're met with delicious food, and accommodating staff. 

They deserve 5-stars just for their amazing customer service. 

However, they should get another 5 for the food as well. The Cooper's Tavern doesn't suffer the same issues of unremarkable and bland, soggy food (I.E. The Old Fashioned). 

If you ever find yourself in Madison, give this place a shot. You shan't be disappointed.

Edit: Thank you, Brie! You were the warmest and sweetest server ever. I appreciate you and the rest of the staff's hard work. I will be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Continue to shine and always busy!   First, I can't say enough about the service; excellent personalization.  Food was consistent and to a high standard as usual.  The highlight was actually the kids menu!   My kids are used to go home cooking and their mac n cheese is stellar!  Not to mention, comes with fresh fruit, veggies and even a beverage!  Also, the mac n cheese is top notch; creamy, tangy and chewy!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time for lunch yesterday and was very happy with both the food and the service. 

I tried the Turkey sandwich which came with thick slices of turkey (none of that thin lunch meat stuff), crispy bacon, avocado, tomato, and lettuce. It comes with a tarragon aioli too, but I had them leave that off because I'm not really a sauce person. I also subbed the wheatberry bread that it comes on for sourdough because I have an obscure allergy and I prefer to avoid it altogether than to ask sometimes. I'm sure they would have gladly checked the ingredients for me though, had I asked.

The sandwich itself was very tasty and came with some delicious homemade chips. It was a pretty decent size though and I ended up taking half of it to go. I ate the rest for lunch today and was glad to see that the bread didn't get too soggy overnight and even the chips that I accidentally refrigerated were still on point!

I think I'll be back to try the dinner and/or cocktails soon!"}
{"text":"Great lunch-good food, good beer, and good place to watch a soccer game.

I came here to watch a Liverpool game and grab some lunch while in town for business. The tavern was recommended to me by some friends on a Liverpool supporter website, The Liverpool Offside. Conveniently, I was staying at the Sheraton and their shuttle stops there as well.

The place is not very large, but the atmosphere was nice. It has a lot of dark wood and a good \"tavern/pub\" feel. The staff was friendly. I ordered a cup of the beef chili. I liked it. For lunch I had the turkey reuben (just called the turkey on the menu). I thought it was excellent. The homemade chips were also very good. I also had a couple of their craft beers. Their selection was excellent and the bartender was very helpful in directing me to a good local brew I couldn't get back home. I also noticed a large selection of Belgian style beers.

Basically, this restaurant was excellent on the food side. The menu is not huge, but, in full disclosure, I prefer shorter menus. As for the beer, this place was also excellent. If you are into premium beers you will enjoy it here. Atmosphere and service were also excellent. Everyone I encountered was friendly and laid back without ever failing to be professional or doing a poor job. 

No complaints about this place!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, it was very crowded.
The tables are small and very close together so you can hear all the conversations around you.
The lunch menu was pretty small just maybe 7 appetizers, 10 entrees (all sandwiches and burgers), and some soup/salads. 
The price was pretty fair for lunch (~10 + tip)
I got the wagyu sliders because I've been wanting to try wagyu beef but honestly.. its alright.. I like the bun which is pretzel and it came with a salad with vingrette dressing. 
My friend got the chicken with chips and the portion was huge with that. 
overall, food was okay (a bit greasey) and the environment was alrite but too crowded. I didn't try the beer or drinks because it was lunch. but overall it was alrite."}
{"text":"Owned by a true Irishman, this place is the best for food and fun with an atmosphere that isn't trying to be something it isn't.  A great place to bring your parents, a date, or just go to by yourself for a great meal."}
{"text":"Now this is why I love Madison.

This place serves up great food made of such quality ingredients. The menu is wonderful; each option sounded so absolutely mouthwatering that it took a lot of will-power for me not to order every single item on the menu...

Ultimately, I resisted the urge and went for the pretzel chicken with butternut squash and brussel sprouts, and boy am I glad that I did. Both the chicken and the veggies were so perfectly cooked and so flavorful.
I'm always afraid to order brussel sprouts when I eat out as they tend to be overcooked, BUT Cooper's Tavern served them up just right and they were quite deliciously prepared. I loved the fact that they weren't drowning in butter as most vegetable sides are when you eat out. They kept it plain and simple and let the freshness of the veggies supply the flavor--perfect.

Not only was the food fantastic, but I loved the atmosphere/decor. It had a nice rustic feel too it that added a woodsy charm to the experience.

The service was great as well: perfectly attentive, informative, and polite.

Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, food is pretty good! The scenery is good and they have a nice outdoor seating. Parking on the street can be tricky so I recommend parking in a ramp."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go watch soccer. They always have soccer games playing, and there  are always other soccer fans around. On Saturday mornings for premiere league soccer, sometimes they open the upstairs area which is taken over by hardcore soccer fans. It's a lot of fun because you can watch soccer games on a big projector screen and hear singing/chanting/cheering from all the soccer fans. It does get pretty loud and crowded and is hard to get a table sometimes, but it's a great place to go if you enjoy soccer. 

The downstairs area is the main restaurant/bar and has a nice atmosphere. They have lots of great beers on tap, and the bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable. The food here is really good. They have a good variety of options on the menu. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good food great beer selection excellent staff that hustles to keep up- place gets extremely busy! Upstairs for events is a nice spot. The owner is a good dude that supports the community so that's a plus."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and an extensive beer list. They also have a bunch of whiskeys and bourbons. I really love the views from there seating areas. That being said, their food is often mediocre and is entirely over-priced. The best foods are the Sconnie eggs and the truffle fries. Go here to drink, not to eat."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see such mixed reviews on this place!  I am generally a fan of food fight restaurants so I went in expecting great food and service, and I wasn't disappointed!  We went on a Thursday evening so we expected a wait but easily got spots at the bar to grab a brew while we waited.  The list of drafts was excellent and I found a new favorite here....Weinstephaner Vitus which is the oldest brewery in the world and this is the only place in Wisconsin the Vitus brew is served on tap...and it's amazing!  Our wait was about 30 minutes which was nice, and we got a great table.  It's loud in here but full of energy, maybe don't bring your grandma!  We had their version of a reuben and the macaroni and cheese and both were fantastic!  We also started with the pretzels, which I could have skipped but they weren't horrible.  Our service was good and attentive and the ambiance is cozy and bustling!  Definitely looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Cooper's! I have been here numerous times now, and I have yet to ever regret a visit. The food is good, the atmosphere is nice, the servers are always on their A Game, pretty much everything is always great. 

Last night we tried the Sconnie Egg and the pretzel with beer cheese dip for an appetizer. The Sconnie Egg was DELISH! It's really big, too. Larger than I expected. Comes with greens and some pickled veggies and a sauce of sorts to dip it in. It's your basic Scotch egg, except it's made with brat meat instead of just sausage. It really didn't taste very much like a brat, though. The pretzel was great, too. Super soft and fluffy on the inside, crisp and salty on the outside. Beer cheese dip was a light but perfect flavor. 

Main course I got the grilled cheese and tomato soup with the house chips. I enjoyed everything about this. The sandwich was so good. It comes with a tomato jam that adds a bit of sweetness to it. Unexpected but very much enjoyed. 

The BF ordered the Cooper's Burger, a classic. He said it was great. It was ordered medium rare, but came out VERY rare. He did eat it but had to pull out a couple chunks of the meat. Other than that, he said it was delicious. 

A few other things I have had here and enjoyed very much include:
Poutine - So good! The frites on their own are wonderful, topped with cheese curds and gravy, it's a match made in heaven. 
Amy's Salad - Spinach, and pears, and goat cheese, oh my! This is one of my favorites. 
Cooper's Cure - on the brunch menu. Delicious peppers, onions, chorizo and eggs covered in Hollandaise. Hello! 
And, the American Breakfast - because you can't go wrong with this perfectly cooked classic. 

The place can get a little cramped at times, it's long and narrow and popular. That being said, I've always enjoyed myself, service is still quick and attentive, and if you decide to eat at the bar, the bar tenders are always great, too. And, if you're into soccer, this is a great Saturday morning soccer bar. Brunch at the bar while watching the Premier League is a must."}

{"text":"Good,  but never great.  Cool ambiance.  Always leaves me feeling like we should have chosen somewhere else.  Less flavor than the menu seems to suggest."}
