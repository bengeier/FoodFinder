{"text":"I have never taken pho to go but Saigon did a fairly good job. With a friend, I shared the grilled pork dish and pho with sliced beef. The hostess was super nice. She saw the way my friend blanched when I said tendon and gently suggested to me that perhaps sliced beef would be the way to go.   Around 10 minutes later, with a nicely packaged bag and a coconut boba tea, we were set to go. (The coconut boba tea tastes like canned coconut cream, so your own taste judgment if you like that or not.)   I had a really fun time unpackaging everything. The broth in a container, the fixings (bean sprouts, basil, lime, jalapeno) in a baggie, noodles and meat in a carton. Super easy to assemble. Taste-wise, not too bad either when you have a pho craving. There was something missing though.   The grilled pork was deliiiicious. Two big grilled pork chops juicing over rice with a big slice of quiche and veggies. Mmm.   However, I must disclaimer this review by saying I was super super hungry and I've been craving Viet food, which I had not eaten in over 3 months."}
{"text":"Finally, traditional Vietnamese soup (and more) has arrived in Champaign-Urbana! I had a delicious hot bowl of beef pho, all the meats cooked to tender perfection. Spring rolls were very fresh and good also. A standout appetizer was the fried shrimp on sugarcane skewers. Don't forget to gnaw the hot sugarcane. UPDATE: on my third visit, service was much improved, fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Food here was very good, although the descriptions on the menu are kind of vague and the vegetarian options are extremely limited to basically fried tofu or steamed vegetables.  Service could use some work.  My husband and I each ordered an appetizer and an entree.  My appetizer arrived immediately, and I finished it long before his was brought out.  My entree followed his appetizer, and then we had to wait for his entree.  They definitely need to work on their timing in getting food out, as it made our meal much less enjoyable since we both spent most of our time there watching the other person eat while we waited for our own food.  Had I been polite about it and waited for his food to arrive so we could eat our courses at the same time, my food would have been cold.    Another service issue is that they have you pay at a register in the front, but no one is actually stationed there.  It took us quite awhile to pay and leave since there was another large party leaving and a woman trying to pick up a carry out order and no employees manning the register.  After awhile, 3 people showed up and one tried to run our credit card, another took off with our ticket so the woman running the card didn't know how much to charge, and well, suffice to say, it was kind of a mess getting out of there.  So they get three stars; minus one for the lack of vegetarian options and another for the service issues.  Both of these things are easy to fix and I hope that my next visit will up them to five!"}
{"text":"Hot noodle bundles Balls of meat floating in soup And green boba tea   (The facts:  Appearance:  Not too shabby.  Clean, attractive interior is much more attractive than you'd expect given it's location in a strip mall.  Food:  High quality Vietnamese food that is prepared and presented very well.  They have an extensive menu selection.    Service:  Friendly staff who truly are interested in making your dining experience pleasurable.  Service CAN be slightly at times, and the entrees don't always come at once.  Perhaps mention this to your server if this may bother you.   Price:  People have complained that the prices are high, but considering the QUALITY and PORTION SIZE, I find the prices to be appropriate.  Not cheap, but appropriate.  Bottom line:  Recommended.)"}
{"text":"Saigon deserves about three stars, but I'm bumping it up one more because of the excellent, friendly service, the pleasant layout, and lack of other competition.  The pho was okay.  I've definitely had better, but it got the job done.  Spring rolls were tasty and well-made.  Our server was courteous, constantly present, and ridiculously polite.  I enjoyed my meal quite a bit, but one of the best parts of the evening had to be the family at the table next to my friend and I.  Their small son, who couldn't have been older than 2, was transfixed by the fro and just stared and stared.  And then waved.  And then chased another little girl around the restaurant.  It was free entertainment, although it got a bit creepy to be stared at by a toddler for so long.  You begin to feel judged.  But yes, the food is 3 stars worthy, and has a substantial number of Chinese items as well.  They also do dim sum for lunch.  And I can't fault a restaurant that makes a pleasing iced tea/fresh lemonade combination.  Well done, Saigon."}
{"text":"I was hoping this would be my new favorite Champaign-Urbana restaurant.  I absolutely love Pho vietnamese noodle soup, and I was excited because Saigon serves Pho.    When my friend and I arrived at Saigon, we waited for a full five minutes before a hostess seated us.  It's not like they were busy; it was 2:30 on a Saturday, and they had only 4 other customers in the restaurant.  Once seated, the waitress asked us if we were ready to order, as she was handing us the menus.  Huh?  I ordered the Pho with pork, and my friend ordered some sort of Chinese chicken.  The waitress brought my Pho within five minutes of ordering, but we then waited an other ten minutes for the chicken.  I was more confused than irritated.  When I finally sampled the pho, I was very underwhelmed.  Pho is supposed to have a rich taste, with bold spices and a slightly fishy flavor.  Saigon's broth tasted like Campbell's chicken noodle soup.  It was edible, but not particularly good.  When the check came, they charged $8.99 for the pho.  In Seattle's hippest pho restaurants, the going rate is $6, including tax!  With its disorganized service, mediocre food, and out-of-the-way location, Saigon really deserves 1.5 stars.  I'll grudgingly round that to 2 stars."}
{"text":"Though this restaurant is a little out of the way, it's worth a visit for fresh authentic Vietnamese food. Every entree here is huge, so while they seem a little pricey at $7-10, each one could easily feed two people. The bowl of pho I got was rich and savory, though I wasn't a fan of some of the cuts of meat included. My boyfriend got lemongrass beef with tiny rice noodles, which was much better. The fried spring rolls were crispy and tangy with fish sauce. We also got smoothies, which had fresh fruit and I drank refreshing coconut water out of a giant Thai coconut.   Overall it was a wonderful experience and the service was excellent. If this place weren't so far away, I'd come here all the time."}
{"text":"The staff is darling and friendly! But let's get to the point...great and filling-but-not-disgustingly-full food. I usually order the B1: grilled beef with spring rolls, topped with shallots and onions, served on rice noodles for eleven bucks. It's fine food with helpful staff."}
{"text":"Some dudes got in a knife fight. Apparently it made some customers uncomfortable and now this place has been re-opened under new management.  I thought the curries here were great, but the menu was flooded with options so the food quality was always iffy. They never had enough servers so everything took forever. Good riddance, I guess?"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Saturday with a friend. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the service to be quite good, though the restaurant was only about a third full at the time. The menu features traditional Vietnamese fare with a little Dim Sum thrown in.   For an appetizer, my friend and I split the steamed chicken feet and the grilled shrimp on sugarcane (Chao Tom). Both were excellent- the chicken feet had the perfect soft, noodle-like texture and was paired with a sweet and savory sauce. The grilled shrimp was the perfect mix of smoky and sweet, and the added bonus of chewing on the sugarcane was definitely a plus.   For the mains, we both had pho, which was a little disappointing. The meat was fine, but the broth lacked flavor and the noodles were a little overcooked and mushy.   For this reason, Saigon rates as a 4 instead of a 5 in my book. It's still a solid pick and I look forward to hitting it up again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place looking for dinner - I was not expecting to find a Vietnamese place in Champaign, IL!  As I drove by - it crossed my mind that just because it's Vietnamese does not mean they serve Pho - my recent visit to Viet Bistro in Falls Church, VA was a reminder of this. BUT - I see the word \"Pho\" in the window - my fears are allayed. For a moment.  I walk in and am seated. The ambiance is quite nice. However, it all goes downhill a bit from there. There is no Pho Ga on the menu. My waiter is confused when I ask him about Pho Ga. I explain that it is the equivalent of Vietnamese Chicken noodle soup.  So then he points me to their \"Pho Thit Heo Nuong,\" which is defined as: Combination Rice Noodles Beef Soup with Grilled Chicken. This does not sound right - but I decide to try it. I also order a side of Summer rolls.  The Summer rolls come out first - with a side of a peanut dipping sauce - which is a bit on the runny/watery side. I add some Sriracha sauce to it - and it seems to be that the Sriracha sauce is not as thick as it should be - it seems a little on the thin side from a consistency perspective.  The rolls themselves are good. I added squirts of Sriracha sauce to several bites of the rolls - definitely not as thick as it should be and not as hot as I am used to - I think they have cut or diluted the Sriracha sauce here.  Then the soup is brought out - a plate of sliced grilled chicken, a bowl of Beef Pho broth with noodles, and a plate of aromatics - bean sprouts, two jalapeno slices, some basil, and a lime wedge.   I taste the broth - this is definitely not Pho Ga broth. I taste the grilled chicken - it's very tasty. Just not what I was expecting when I walked in. I dumped the grilled chicken into the broth, added some Sriracha sauce and ate the whole thing.  The soup does not even come close to many of the Pho places back in Virginia."}
{"text":"4 stars simply because they're the only Vietnamese place around here. Not 5 stars because service was sketchy (yeah, everything is dropped off at your table sporadically) and the food was mediocre.  Spring rolls - very good; small is really small, though. Fish sauce -- authentic, high quality. House fried rice -- one piece of shrimp - one. Bland in comparison to Chinese fried rice, and yet I liked the rather plain taste. It was more of a comfort dish than a crazy-with-flavor food. Reheated very well when we took half of it home - huge portion.  No wait for a table, and they're bringing in new servers as often as they can.  It was interesting that our server was foreign (Chinese, maybe?) but did not know anything about Vietnamese food. My partner asked in Vietnamese if they had some highly popular sauce (which they did), but the server did not understand what was being asked. On the other hand, the server also did not understand English very well. We simply pointed to the menu when ordering. Speaking of which, the menu is about 10 pages long full of 100+ dishes. I hope they downsize that so that they're not throwing out inventory constantly as it spoils because they have too much of too many things. Ah, the joys of start-ups. I would be surprised if they stay around longer than a year, but I would love to be wrong!  We put a credit card in the bill folder/thing and paid at the table. I'm not sure if that was correct or not given a previous reviewer talking about waiting at the register, but no one even batted an eye."}
{"text":"It's sad to say but this place has gone down the drain since I last reviewed it.  From the time of my last review, the prices of the entrees have gone up...especially for the pho.  Not only is the food getting more expensive but it seems that the quality is declining too.  The summer rolls (the unfried kind) used to be filled w/ large shrimps and rice noodles but now the shrimps are smaller and the filling is mainly just shredded lettuce and hardly anything else and definitely not as filling.  The pho used to be very flavorful and taste almost authentic but now it just tastes like any old bland broth.  It tastes more watered down and pretty much uneventful.     The one positive thing left to say is that the service has improved considerably.  I think they hired more servers and also got a re-education in customer service because we didn't have to wait as long to be seated and we didn't have to wait forever to put in our order.  The servers also managed to remember to refill our drinks while we were there.  Overall, I highly doubt I'm going back any time soon...unless I'm extremely desperate for pho."}
{"text":"I liked it.  It was much nicer on the inside than I expected, and it had all the old reliable vietnamese items:  summer rolls, hugenormous pho bowls, bubble tea.  I think that the service has probably been consistently improving since the place opened, it was perfectly good for me tonight.  My bubble tea was frozen, which I've never seen before, and my pho was less flavorful than I would hope from a vietnamese soup (give me more limes, please please please!  Definitely more than three wedges for 3 bowls of soup!), but the prices were reasonable, the portions were HUGE, the dining experience was nice and relaxing, and I'm sure I'll go back."}
