{"text":"It is true that the food isn't fantastic, but I've been to my share of buffets around here and for a Chinese buffet, they have the best.  I don't care much for anything chicken unless it is breast meat so I cannot comment on those dishes.  But they have great options for kids and the regular staples - fried rice, egg rolls, spring rolls, lo mein, soups etc.  There is also a fruit and dessert bar.  Really a very nice buffet.  There would be something for everyone.  I say if you like Chinese buffet you'd like this place.  I think the prices are higher on Sundays for the after church crowd - though I could be wrong."}
{"text":"Just another Chinese food trough.  Nothing good.  Nothing bad.  Isn't gluttony one of the seven deadly sins?"}
{"text":"Great Chinese/Japanese buffet. I go here for lunch often, and I hear they have snow crab legs at night, but I haven't tried them. Cost for lunch is about $7 after tax, a little more than most, but not bad at all. It's nestled behind Fuddrucker's and once you are inside you feel so far away from the hubbub of the busy Matthews section near 51 and 74. The atmosphere is generally quiet and relaxed.

The food is great. You have the staples like Lo Mein, Fried Rice, General Tso's Chicken, but also lots of stuff you don't normally find in the Chinese take-out like whiting fish, fried eggplant, sushi (not particularly great, but hey, it's there), fresh mussels, bacon-wrapped scallops.

I do tend to eat late lunches though, and if you're anything like me, get there before about 2:30 or so because after that the food starts to decline in quantity and quality.

Overall, highly recommended Oriental buffet if you are in the Matthews area."}
{"text":"Buffet Dynasty is one of the better Asian buffets I've been to.  The quality of their product is adequate and everything tastes pretty good.  The sushi is tiny and not the best, but hey, I can stuff my face with as many tiny rolls as I desire.

The man who I believe to be the owner is always working the buffet or speaking with customers directly.  Very personable, always smiling.  He keeps the restaurant quite clean.

Go on a weekday during lunch to get the best rate for an adult buffet.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"As far as buffets go this is one of the better ones! I used to come here a lot when I worked in Matthews, but had not been back in a while. Did lunch here Friday and realized how much I missed this place.
As far as Chinese goes this is about as authentic as you are going to get at a buffet. I'm not saying it is \"real authentic Chinese\", but it is for a buffet. You have to know where you are eating.
I liked everything I had, soups were great, all the sauces I had were pretty good too! Wait staff was on top of refills, clearing the table etc.... All in all a great experience. 
Right now they are running a lunch buffet special for their 12th anniversary. My wife and I only paid 5.99 each, well worth it!"}
{"text":"Much cleaner than \"other places\" along route 74.  Some are cheaper but they are filthy with sauce spoons and food spilled everywhere. Not here. 
I go here and pay a bit more for the cleanliness and excellent wait staff. 

The food is good. Better than average. And where else can you even get hot pot."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese/Japense restaurant. They have a wider selection than most places. I'll say it looks nicer on the inside than the food tastes. I was underwhelmed by the food. 

We went in Sept of '09 and have not been back. The restaurant is set back off the road sort of behind a Fudruckers."}
{"text":"The buffet is good if you really know what to eat. They have the deep fried shrimp, korean bbq, clams, juicy salmon, and duck. I don't like their sushi. Don't eat their general tao chicken or sesame chicken. One had rancid chicken and the other had rancid sauce all of the times I went. 

They offer hot pot buffet and it's a huge deal if you're a fan. You order your unlimited ingredients plate by plate. You can choose from a long list including blue crab, snow crab, shrimp with head, mussels, shrimp paste, lamb, beef, squid, water cress, napa, spinach, etc. I can eat a lot so it's a great deal for me. The soup base can be either spicy or clear. I like the dipping sauce as well.

This is my economic version of tin tin!"}
