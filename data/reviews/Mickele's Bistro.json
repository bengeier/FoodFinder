{"text":"I come to Mickeles very often. I really love their:
Deep fried shrimp
Fried calamari 
Caesar salad 
And my fav is The Tiramisu cake (which they make in house by the way) 
Service is great, place is really nice. 
When you stop by try the Tiramisu you won't regret."}
{"text":"Michele's (or Mickele's) Ristorante is a hidden gem attached to the Best Western hotel on the Mississauga/Etobicoke border a few blocks south of Renforth.  We recently had dinner there and were pleasantly surprised.  

All of our meal was prepared in-house and was delicious.  No Sysco heat and serve in this restaurant!  We ordered our choice of 3 antipasti for two for $15 and added a pizza margarita for $10.  The thin crust pizza featured hand stretched dough and was cooked in their wood burning oven.  It was a perfect light meal for us but would also be a great starter for a bigger meal.  They also feature 5 antipasti for two for $19 and have an extensive Italian menu.  Some items are individual and others are intended for sharing like pasta for two or caesar salad for two.  There were several tables taking advantage of shared plates.

Prices were reasonable, especially considering the proximity to the airport which seems to raise the price of everything.  The staff was friendly and our waiter offered up house-infused chile pepper oil for drizzling.  It had a terrific kick!

They have a lunch menu, as well.  We would happily go there again!

{"text":"Dinner there after arriving at the Best Western Sunday night was great. Food was served very hot, tasted great, and was not an oversized portion. Staff was friendly and honest."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!  Our server had a nasty attitude that she definitely needs to change. She was very snarky and extremely rude. Completely ruined my appetite. Will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best wood fired pizza I have had anywhere hands down. They must have been on their game tonight! I was served the absolute best mushroom and spicy Italian sausage pie I have had in quite a while and called bonita whilst I was served.... You can kill me with flattery and your tasty cholesterol any time!!!! The tiramisu is excellent and worth taking a slice home not to share:) Kudos, gents, it's been a wonderful experience and I shall return upon the next visit to Toronto!"}
{"text":"I just enjoyed a classic Italian meal that was surprisingly delicious and nuanced.  The place itself is unassuming from the outside, but given that it's March and 3 degrees F outside, it's no wonder they keep the shades drawn.  Entry is through the side hallway in winter since they close the patio.

Once inside however the restaurant itself feels a bit cavernous, but very comfortable; with a split-level floor plan and small bar area.  It was sleepy at 7:00 pm on a midwinter Wednesday, with a few solo travelers like me and a few couples, and one larger family party in the corner.

The service is friendly, attentive, prompt and unpushy.  The menu is classic and simple.

I had the Caesar salad, the Agnolotti and the Tiramisu.  Each dish was very delicious and exactly what I was hoping for.  I could say something here about \"travelers should be grateful such a place is nearby since not much else is;\" but frankly, the place is good and would do well anywhere.

I also ordered a pizza to go since the Tripadvisor reviews were all about it; I was full from dinner but it smelled so good I had a bite and it's awesome.  Pizzas are made and cooked to order, thin crust, and done in an open fire brick oven right there.

I'm here for six more days, and I'll definitely hit this place again."}
{"text":"I am impressed. 
Continental breakfast was ok but wanted to try the real food which was Italian food and and their pizza.  Thin bubbly crust pizza with good toppings and I wasn't left surprised in a bad way. 

Ordered the recommended grilled calamari 4 stars yummy! 
Grilled and topped with salad greens in a balsamic reduction and fresh ground pepper.  

House salad was very good too!  Fresh salad greens and more of that yummy dressing but not a reduction like the aforementioned dish.  4 stars too. 

I could have order two of them and be happy.  

Pizza was the sausage and jalape√±o pepper with red sauce.  $15 well worth the price.  

Add a few brew and tea and I'm ready for a nap now.  

I will be back.  

This location over the years has had challenges, but I thin this is the right spot for it.  

Yeah, I'll be here first thing in the morning again because it's attached to the Best Western Inn.  But their regular food is where they really shine.  Good service too!"}
{"text":"I have now been here several time for dinner and breakfast. And I am very happy with the service the care and quality that goes into their food. 

I have been a long time fan of Italian food so I can be over critical when it's not done right. I am a strong believer that the sauce makes the pasta; you get the sauce right the rest is pasta. I like meat with my pasta and I prefer a spicy meat. All these ingredients are done right at Mickele's.  

The outside and inside of the building reminds me of the architecture in Rome. So even the building has a very Italian feel. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Located right next to a Best Western. Interior is really nice, better than expected given the reasonable prices. 

I went with a group of people for lunch - and we all found the food to be decent but not special overall. The Bruschetta wood oven pizza tasted good and had a crispy thin crust, but needed more sauce and/or cheese. Service was friendly. According to the lunch menu,15% tip is included. 

For some reason, there's a mix of \"Mickele's\" and \"Michele's\" on the signage."}
{"text":"Lame. We were all craving Italian and probably got our hopes too high. Being an American, I was used to the abdundant & oversized entrees in Italian restaurants in the U.S. I dunno about the rest of the Italian restaurants in Canada, but size of the entrees in this one was only half the size of wut I'm used to, and I'm talking dinner time. I'm a petite girl, and I don't eat very much anyway, but I was still hungry even after desserts, so that gives you an idea. Anyway, the food wasn't awful or anything. But the service was sub par. I would've just left the restaurant w/a neutral impression, except for what happened at the end of our meal. 

So on to the bill which was like, $75 something, we noticed an add-on gratuity of like $11 and change, for a party of 4, which I guess is normal over there. But as we were paying, the waiter asked my mom, \"what about tip?\" My dad said, \"it's already there (pointing out the gratuity)\", but my mom was paying and the waiter kept looking at my mom as he was entering her cc #. Again he asked, what about the tip? Again, my dad pointed out, \"It's already there.\" My mom was kinda confused and just went w/what my dad said. So the waiter just entered whatever was on the receipt, and then left abruptly. Me and my sister grab the receipt, cuz we were on the other end and didn't quite know what was going on, but when we found out, of course we were like, \"Whaaat.... pffft.\" The nerve of that guy. He didn't even refill our water, what the heck. He had the nerve to ask for an extra tip after a 15% gratuity tacked on w/o prior notice? p00! 

Maybe it's that way in Canada, but damn, at least have the decency to provide good service. The food wasn't even anything to write home about, but I just felt the need to write this to warn others"}
{"text":"I told the guy at my hotel that I was in the mood for a low key, casual pile of Italian food.  He assured me Michele's was the place.  I was bummed to see white tablecloths, fancy waiters...and an empty restaurant.  Me and one other single traveler.  So the atmosphere was a dud.  It was a Tuesday evening, about 6.  
The food was OK.  I had veal saltambucca(?) and it was good, but much cheesier than I would expect, or like.  Wine was good. Waiter was friendly, if not awkwardly bored.
A good place, a decent meal.  I would not call it a must-go."}
{"text":"The food was very good but i thought the costs were high in comparison to the portion of food that i received."}
{"text":"The place has a nice feel. The food was ok but not memorable. We had the grilled calamari which was over cooked. The pizza was nice and service was consistent."}
