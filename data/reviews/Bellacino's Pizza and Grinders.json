{"text":"Food is really good BUT the place is nasty. The floors are ALWAYS ALWAYS dirty and 85%of the time it's smoky inside. I know you don't eat in the bathrooms but they are nasty too. I go about twice a month in hopes the cleanliness will improve."}
{"text":"Love their pizza and grinders.  Always fresh ingredients; delicious! However we dined in last night and I must say they need more communication between employees and more detailed customer service training. I ordered a pizza with peppers & beef on HALF and cheese only on the other half.  It came out with beef on 1 half and peppers on the other half.  Disappointed,  but they immediately put in an order for a new cheese pizza.  And they were apologetic,  but we never heard from management. Also dirty dishes were piled high at the bins by the trash cans and I saw several napkins lying on the floor that employees passed by on several occasions.  We'll be back but only for takeout."}
{"text":"A local pizza and sub/grinder shop (as the name suggests). It's fast casual. You order at the counter and they bring it to you when it's ready. It makes for a quicker, cheaper dinner than going to a restaurant with a waiter service.   They have a long list of grinders and pizza to choose from, plenty of appetizer options, and I've enjoyed it when I've gone. I can't comment on the pizza, as I typically pick up a grinder.  Also, I believe they introduced fried banana peppers as an appetizer recently, if that's your thing."}
{"text":"The pizza taste is good might give a better review if it was at least warm by the time I got home. Maybe a new counter person but because I went to the bathroom the didn't call my name after the first time. So I sat for another 20 mins while my Pizza sat there. But I could be the exception to the rule. Pizza tastes good. I think the oven in my house is in order..."}
{"text":"Good cheese. Prefer to have circle pie cut in traditional style verses their cut, but overall one of the better pizzas in the area"}
{"text":"Let's just the best dam grinders ever u can grind many things but nothing like the grinder . Chicken cam groom the coop the coop has good chicken never go wrong bellacinos"}
{"text":"Decent place.  Big grinder sandwiches and average pizza.  Actually, some folks really like this place.  It's great for a slightly better than fast-food kind of place."}
{"text":"Really bad visit this past Tuesday! Really disappointed. Store was full of smoke. This is not the first time. Have encountered many, many times before. Did not dissipate in the hour we were there. Something is wrong with oven or ventilation system.   Also they always seem to be out of silverware and plastic just melts with hot pizza or grinders.    I also observed food preparation people walking and standing on pizza pans that had fell down.    Does not seem to be any management present.    Food is still excellent if you can put up with the other issues. We normally go here once a week. May be a while before we go back...."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food came promptly. And the pizza was delicious. My entire family enjoyed it. We highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing pasta dishes. As a person from NYC who appreciate good Italian food I found this place to be awesome."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, with their grinders being my favorite.  Their pizza is ok, but I honestly believe Papa Johns is much better.  The place is also a little pricey.  Lastly, I tried the cinnamon sticks the other day and they were terrible.  Honestly could not chew through them...just not edible.  Regardless, the House Specialty Grinder is great but not for those on a diet!"}
{"text":"Only reason I come here is for the good pizza and subs. The young girl with short brown hair working the counter is snobby and gives out dirty looks to everyone. When I came in here today, half of the tables in here were dirty and not cleaned. They weren't busy at all either. I wouldn't be surprised if this place got closed down due to lack of customers and rude service in the past year or so of coming in here. This place used to be great but has went downhill fast."}
{"text":"Great pizza cozy  place food is awsome good lunch specials one of the best in gastonia"}
{"text":"I must admit how pleasantly surprised I was!  I have lived down the road from this particular location for years but never been a customer; perhaps of my usual tendency to choose one of the large national pizza franchises OR because of the under emphasized exterior.  Regardless, the staff was friendly and the pizzas had the old school feel of a Mom & Pop pizzeria; including the slightly imperfect and charred crust.  Great taste (even as leftovers) and reasonable value.  Help support the lesser know franchises that deserve more credit that they deserve!"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  I try to go here at least 2 or 3 times a month.  Sandwiches are very good too.  My daughter really likes their chicken al credo."}
{"text":"Grinders are good. Cinnamon sticks are delicious!"}
{"text":"I used to come here years ago and they had the best pizza. Haven't had that recently but I just got the steak grinder sans mushrooms yesterday and it was really good. I ordered the half size which is 9\" and had leftovers for another lunch. They have a new steak pizza that I am excited to try.  It was 11:30 when I went for lunch and already getting pretty busy!"}
{"text":"Squeezed into a strip center with a now-closed grocery story, its easy not to notice Bellacino's.  What grabbed my attention was the word Grinder.  I though, \"What's a Grinder?\" My only point of reference was a line in Adam Sandler's \"Lunch Lady Land\" song from SNL.    Of course, I know now that a Grinder is just a sub sandwich..it just isn't a term we used back in Texas.  But this sandwich is pretty great.  The bread is phenomenal: toasted, but not rock hard.  A half-sandwich is 9 inches and plenty for a meal.    I've ordered pizza here and its not bad.    But looking around at the other diners, the grinder seems to be the choice of the majority of customers. Order one and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bellacino's overall has pretty good pizza & above average subs, & you sure do get a large \"grinder\". Their grinders come loaded with toppings & are absolutely huge. And don't get Subway sizes mixed up in your head with Bellacino's, because if you order a full size grinder you'll be in for a shock. It's right around 20\", with the half grinder around 10\". Also, all of their grinders are over toasted so expect a crispy crust unless you specify otherwise. They have some pretty diverse grinder options to choose from, but you won't be too thrilled if you love to customize (they only have a few options there).   Outside of the grinder realm, their pizzas are pretty good & greasy. Nothing too great though, but not too bad for the price & size. This is their other specialty based on their namesake, but I'd definitely choose grinder over pizza here. They do have other menu items, but I've never ventured into that realm."}
{"text":"Great food and nice staff. My work has recently brought me nearby and I discovered this pizza joint. Everything I have gotten from them, pizza or grinder, have always been great."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good. I was pretty disapointed with the chicken wings. I am from Rochester, NY so I have pretty high standards. Overall, I would say that I would come back for another try!"}
{"text":"As I sit here at 7:30am eating leftover lasagna for breakfast from Bellacino's, I thought...what better time to write a review on it. I must say the 4 stars are explicitly awarded for the lasagna because I haven't had a chance to try anything else...and take out only. But this place is always jumping...parking lot full...and people walking out with their pants slightly tighter than when they went in. I've ordered take-out twice and the crew here really works hard. No \"out of the jar\" sauce taste and the garlic bread is heavenly. When you order at the counter you can see everything prepared in the kitchen so your meal is prepared with full disclosure. Love this place and can't wait to sample more of the their menu and experience dining in.  PS...they also have free wifi!"}
{"text":"If you want a sub (called a \"grinder\" here), but don't want the usual (or an image of Jared while you eat), go to Bellacino's and you won't be sorry.  As mentioned by Nick, these things are monstrous.  Not just in length, but in width too.  The bread is probably twice as wide as a Subway sub, and it's at least 505 longer than a standard Subway sub.  Add to that a good variety to choose from, and all of them oven-baked (unless you ask for otherwise), and you've got a good meal, even at the small size.  The large are gigantic.  I can barely finish a small myself.  I've only tasted their pizza from someone else's plate, but it looks pretty good."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza. Lots of fresh toppings. No skimping here. The medium can feed 3 people easily. It's not as thin as a ny style but it's a fresh and tasty I'm from Rochester,NY and this is the Italian style I'm used to, real substantial. The toppings are fresh and plentiful. The round pizza is cut into squares so it easy to manage. The service was friendly and fast. The gent at the counter was very helpful and eager to please. We also got the house Italian grinder. Very good lots of meat. The small was enough for two or one very hungry teenage boy. The bread is made from the same pizza dough and I loved it. Not dry but crispy and hot. Plenty of lettuce tomato and mayo I'll be back for sure. I want to try their pasta dishes"}
{"text":"I think this is the first time I have gained 5lbs from a salad. Nutrition facts are online but they seem underestimated.   The garlic cheese bread was a little too buttery and not doughy enough for my taste.   The sandwiches are gigantic!! The HALF grinder is 9\"... Crazy."}
{"text":"This place makes great food, when it's made correctly. Service has steadily went from bad to worse. We waited an hour tonight for a steak sub and taco salad after being told it would take 30 minutes. After an hour wait we asked what was taking so long. It seems our food was sitting there the whole time and no one bothered to tell us. After the 20 minute drive home we discovered our taco salad had no meat. Not a happy camper. I called and the manager promised a taco salad on the house next time. I can definitely say there'll be no next time. This location is continually getting our orders wrong. The food is good but the front counter needs to get it together. They dropped the ball tonight, twice. And the girl taking our order and handing out food either had a recent brain injury or was extremely high. Super slow motion everything, slurred speech."}
{"text":"I must say they have totally improved their Reuben grinder since I wad last there 1.5 yrs ago!! It wasn't burned in any way, not drippy because the sauerkraut, and I have been back 2x since last Tues for more! The place IS busy at dinnertime always. I must say I never get anything but yhe REUBEN but good corned beef is hard to find in Gaston Co. so I keep on getting that. They have about 20 different grinders to choose from plus salads, sides, a few desserts."}
{"text":"I love the cheese steak subs here but in the past year they are less cheesy and have far less meat on them considering they are eight bucks. They are still good but were better"}
{"text":"This place just closed today while my coworkers were there.  They said another pizza type place is going in the space."}
