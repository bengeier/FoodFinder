{"text":"Great place, the staff are prompt and friendly, they have a great selection of craft beers and the food is off the hook. The Calamari Burger was one of the best things I've ever eaten. Prices are average (which can still be too expensive for me some of the time haha) and the clientele ranges from hipsters to business people. It's a casual place with no dress code but a HUGE step up from a lot of Danforth restaurants.   My only complaint is their seating. With two long cafeteria tables and one group table at the back you would think they have plenty of space, however on a busy night (Thursday, Friday, Saturday) it's impossible to be seated if you bring more than 4 people. My friends and I waited with a group of 9 for 45 minutes because they were \"waiting for the big table to open up\". Totally understandable, however, during that time they were seating smaller groups of 2-4. I feel as though they could have pushed a few tables together to accommodate us. We all had one drink at the bar then left for a larger establishment."}
{"text":"Brunch. Oh Holy Brunch. The Wren knows how to do you well! 4-words. Deep Fried Egg Yolks. DAMN. On top of the delicious daily specials, awesome burgers and a craft beer list that is the shining glory of the Danforth! Definitely worth a visit from your parched and hungry selves."}
{"text":"Okay.  I haven't been here, but I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt and toss 'em a 5/5. I lurk their Instagram daily to see what they're cooking up. I really want to go, but I'm kinda nervous to cross the Don.  The East End is a cruel, mysterious place.   Not looking for any trouble, just a good a meal a little far from home.   *sigh*"}
{"text":"Once our favorite place now in favor we came here last night with friend 11.30 pm female server ask us that last call was at 12 pm we order 2 beers on tap male server and female was putting stools on the table while customers where inside I thought it was rude for servers to put stools on the table while customers are inside we will definitely not return here we just went next door to sauce had great time there try it out ..and new place on danforth called local 1797 coxwell try it amazing"}
{"text":"This place is so good that we've started showing up for brunch just to avoid the dinner crowds. For dinner, order the brisket sandwich or the fried chicken sandwich. (If you can, ask for the chicken sandwich without the watercress relish. I feel like they're going for a chicken-and-collards combo, but the relish is distractingly bitter.) Both are exquisitely juicy, and come with salty, spicy fries that are perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside.   For brunch, I really like the eggs benedict with red pepper compote. It's lighter than the pork belly or chorizo, and the compote is tangy enough to offset the hollandaise and the egg yolk. Also, most of their brunch options come with a salad, which I appreciate. The Wren actually takes their salad seriously -- no wilted greens or pale tomatoes. I also really enjoy their guacamole -- at first I wondered about included a diced hardboiled egg in there, but it really works and makes the appetizer feel more substantial.   My secret hope is that they one day decide to pair their fried chicken from the sandwich with the brunch waffles they make on weekends. This is one of the few places I'd trust in town to do chicken and waffles right, and I bet it would be awesome. Also, if they continue to be this busy, they may need to invest in a sister space nearby -- maybe a bar on one side, and the dining room on the other?   One more thing: I really love the music they choose. It's like the one place in town I can reliably listen to a mix that includes both Johnny Cash and Radiohead."}
{"text":"Great vibe for a chill evening out with friends. Had the southern fried chicken sandwich and it was a home run!"}
{"text":"This is my jewel on the Danforth. Everything is fresh and home made at very reasonable price, a good choice of beer and very friendly staff. Love The Wren!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, wonderful staff and yummy food. A little loud and would have preferred a more private table (sat at communal harvest table) but enjoyed everything we ordered, especially the cauliflower app."}
{"text":"Like true restaurant reviewers, my wife and I ate here twice in app 1 week before writing my review,   Our first trip was a weekend brunch/lunch visit with a friend of ours.  We started with The Wren Caesar which has a touch of a homemade habanero hot sauce for some heat. I love a good Caesar and this didn't disappoint.  The heat from the habanero was just enough to give me the head sweats.  My wife ordered the Beef Brisket Eggs Benedict which was very good but when you are mixing beef brisket and eggs benedict how can it not be?  Our friend and I each ordered the Uncle Buck Burger (how can you even say that without thinking of John Candy?). It came with cheese, bacon, 1000 Island Dressing, Chipotle Sauce and a Beer Battered Onion Ring on the Burger plus fries. It was fantastic, but even for a chubby guy, too much food.  We returned shortly thereafter to have dinner with our son and his girlfriend to celebrate his birthday.   Our son had the Uncle Buck Burger (brought leftovers home), his girlfriend had the Empanada Special, my wife had the Meatball Daily Special and I had the Mr Pong's Fried Chicken Sandwich. I don't think there are many things better, in life, than a really good southern fried chicken, and this was absolutely one of them  The Wren is definitely a refer to / return to restaurant.  PS - It was shortly after eating here that we saw The Wren on The Food Network's \"You Gotta Eat Here\". You do \"Gotta Eat Here\"!"}
{"text":"Came in for a Sunday brunch, this place is definitely nothing to write home about. The service was underwhelming and the kitching took so long we thought they forgot about our order. Our group ate the eggs bennie and Hungry Wren Breakfast, everything came with overcooked eggs and was average at best."}
{"text":"You do got to eat here.  Yum. It is just freah made from scratch and filled with flavour. Don't wait. Try it. Tell me what you think."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times for food. Ridiculously good. The best cornbread I've had in Toronto. Great friendly service and good prices."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It is so comfortable with excellent service and wonderful food! The staff there are all so friendly and knowledgable! The green Chili chicken is my favorite thing and the rotating taps always have something interesting to try."}
{"text":"My wife and I had brunch here this past Saturday. She had the eggs benedict with roasted red pepper and tomato ragout. I had the huevos gringos, both dishes were excellent.   The salsa verde had a little heat, not as much as I would like but I still enjoyed it. The bean chimichanga was very tasty and the buttery croissant was great for mopping up the egg yolk. The picco de gallo was fresh and vibrant.  The eggs benedict was more substantial than the huevos, but I didn't leave feeling hungry, it was enough to satisfy. I think though, if you are a big eater or absolutely famished the huevos would not be enough.   We each had a Caesar, which had some great spice in it.   The service was quick and professional. We arrived just after it opened at 11 am, it filled up quick. If you're planning to arrive 11:30ish or later there may be a bit of a wait for a table.  There were a number of kids there, we'll definitely go back with our 3-year-old some time in the near future."}
{"text":"Excited to have The Wren open in my 'hood. Up-and-coming neighborhood, I like to think, deserving of a few great restaurants. And this is definitely a great restaurant. Fun selection of beer on tap (very necessary since you will not get straight to a table). But has always been worth the wait. Service is great -- at the bar and tables. Food is consistently tasty. Backyard Burger's a favorite main (as was Turkey Sausage and Polenta, which has sadly been retired). Guacamole and Chips to start. Anything else I've ordered has been tasty too. Need to go for brunch soon... Make sure to check out the old Coca Cola ad on the east wall uncovered during renovations... adds to an already fun environment. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Love it! Cozy, uncomplicated, unpretentious and genuine. The staff are friendly. The menu is simple, the beer local and diverse and the place is clean. I had the special and my better half the brisket sandwich; both were delicious. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love love love. Amazing cocktails, lovely people running the joint (who did so much of the work themselves, I saw the owner during construction & dude was regularly covered in paint, drywall, sawdust...) a labour of love and that fried chicken sandwich tells the tale of love right in your mouth. A welcome addition! Go Danforth East!"}
{"text":"Had the Wren burger and it was soo amazing. The male bartender was really nice and so was the server who sat us. The place is small so you are usually going to be waiting for a table but boy is it worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, staff and selection of beers.   Like others have said it is welcome addition to that stretch of the Danforth. I've been in a few times, both when empty and full of people, same relaxed atmosphere regardless."}
{"text":"Amazing friendly service. Cozy with comfort food! Good prices for creativity and taste in food selection! Would definitely recommend this for a casual date, or even some dinner and drinks with the girls!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Great food, friendly helpful staff, really wonderful & wacky specials every day, and a great draft beer list with new finds popping up every now & then.  The staff are great, very accomodating, even for dietary restrictions.  They work hard to make things work for their customers!  Great for a late beer or brunch out with the family!"}
{"text":"I had Huevos Tostadas for lunch, it was great. Very happy to find this restaurant, will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We are so lucky to have this newish spot in the neighborhood. Great food - the polenta and tofu sounds unappetizing but it's amazing. It's also baby/kid friendly for an early dinner or pint."}
{"text":"Great new place!  Nice decor.  Server Zach was helpful and made us feel very welcome.  Pork chimichanga was so good and the included guac and side salad were definitely a cut above.    We had a fun dinner and only regret is that they don't yet have any desserts or sweets."}
{"text":"Nice bar but really loud averaging 90-100db with a peak of 103.  Food was delicious but a limited selection. Nice selection of beers."}
{"text":"beautiful decor, not trying too hard, definitely a lovely space to enjoy drinks and snacks.  friendly and very knowledgeable wait staff. food is excellent and arrives quickly. not a vast menu but i prefer it that way - i hate being overwhelmed by pages of choices.  GREAT BEER SELECTION!!!  winner!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. Boozy brunch and amazing dinner! Very good beer selection and the waiters are very knowledgeable about all of them. I usually order whatever the special is and am always happy! I go for the great food and beer and I stay for the amazing service and great vibe. I rave about this place to all my clients."}
{"text":"The food's nice and the beer selection's not bad but the service STINKS! It's a local spot for us so we definitely gave it a try a number of times and every time we've been here - the staff has always managed to make a snarky remark that was totally unsolicited. Rude bunch. Used to be nicer when they first opened, but I guess that's not their priority anymore."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Great beers on tap, the playlist is perfect and the food is always so damn tasty.  I'm really glad there is a great place like this in the area.  Sometime it can take a while to get a table but the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"I realized it's been over a year since I left a review for The Wren and I've been back almost once a month since! By far my favourite menu item is the Fried Chicken sandwich. It's seasoned well and provides just the right ratio to meat. I have to stop myself from ordering it every time.   It's been a few months since I've been for brunch, but I agree with other reviewers, I think this is still a hidden gem. I live in Leslieville and it's nice to be able to get a table without standing in line for an hour on the weekend. And the food is delicious, I'm a fan of the eggs benedict.   Last recommendation is to save room for dessert. Throughout their first year they've added dessert options and I haven't had one that didn't deliver. The stout chocolate cake I think is my favourite. It's rich flavour and smooth texture make it hard to fit it all in, but I try. However, the cinnamon bun cheesecake is a close second.   The only complaint I've ever had is that it can be really loud in the place. They've added dampeners to the ceiling though and I feel that's made a difference to the background noise.   Check it out if you're in the area, or go to the area to check it out. It's worth the trip."}
{"text":"The food and beer doesn't disappoint. It gets a little busy on the weekends, but I've never had to wait for long. The food menus are always really creative. Everything I've eaten here has been delicious every single time. They have great beers on tap, too. Definitely on my list of favourite places to eat and drink in Toronto."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I love this place.  I always go with the dinner special and its always amazing. I'm sure the regular menu is good too, but the specials are too good to pass on.  Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Visited for brunch.  Food.  Excellent.  The beef brisket is amazing.  The hollandaise is up there.  The huevos were tasty with a unique blend of spices. The service, not so good.  Not a smile was cracked, and attention was definitely lacking.  Would visit again, hopefully it was just an off day for them."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, great simple food. Fantastic service!! I really loved the unique beer menu and the warm homestyle vibe the place has. I can't say enough good things about this place! I had the chicken sandwich which was delicious, crispy goodness on the outside and juicy inside :)   Just a tip for the staff though: it's pretty dusty on top of the wood paneling on your wall. Not a total turn off, but you may want to give it a wipe down!"}
{"text":"Delicious food at great prices. Attentive service. Lots of character in the setting! Relaxed decent customers."}
{"text":"The Wren gets a full 5 stars! The only downsides are the popularity and the opening hours - make sure you arrive early (but not too early, they don't open early)"}
{"text":"Had the braised steak sandwich and also tried the brisket, both were awesome! Great staff with tons of passion, no generic lame answers to questions here. Placed an order and mentioned an allergy, not only did they look into it but they went the extra mile to ensure it wouldnt be an issue. Great food, great staff, good beer selection, truly one of the best spots in the city!"}
{"text":"I'd really like to give this place a better rating, and given the multitudes of great reviews from other diners, I'm not sure if we've just been unlucky on our visits or just have vastly different standards :S. We will continue trying to come here and hopefully it improves. The area is so badly in need of a nicer place for young people to go, and this is the place.  The food, while nothing extraordinary, is exactly what it purports to be. It isn't dressed up as fancy, haute cuisine. It is mostly deep fried, cheesy, faux-South western fun, and on that front it delivers. Tried some yummy little apps that were only on the menu for Toronto Beer Week- we were not disappointed. Things could be hotter (temperature wise.) Not sure if this is just a result of food sitting in the pass, or if that's the way it comes out. Our empty plates sat with us until we ordered another round. Gross.  The service is poor, and that is being generous. Clumsy and amateur. We received 2 sets of cutlery each, and no water... for over an hour... and several different dishes... until we asked (after flagging down our server, as we'd had to each time we wanted something, by making a \"needy\" looking face and leaning forward on our stools.) We had also received no water on our previous visit- not sure what gives, as I see the tables receiving cute decanters of water made out of old Bulleit Bourbon bottles. I don't know if it has to do with being sat at the bar, but going that long without even the offer of water, even if you're drinking beer, is really unacceptable. That alone can turn a great dining experience into a poor one. Just give EVERYBODY water- problem solved. And for the love of God, keep refilling it. We asked for water and it was granted. I'm a fairly easy customer, working in the industry myself, but that point really soured me on the night.   On the plus sides for service, product knowledge was great, and, when we received any attention whatsoever, it was friendly and courteous. When we settled on sharing a bottle of a more expensive saison, our server very courteously let us know it was a little more pricey before we were surprised with our bill.   The extensive beer list is worth a visit alone. Rotating taps and a great bottle/can list. The Dieu du Ciel Rosee d'Hibiscus is to die for.  TL;DR. Service is perplexingly bad, but servers are knowledgeable and friendly, when you can get their attention. Food is well priced, yummy comfort food. Beer list has something (or a few somethings) for everyone."}
{"text":"Between the brunch and dinner, the Wren is hands-down amazing. The decor of the restaurant is very down home country and the food reflects it with the Tex-mex vibe. Loved every meal I've had there and unquestionably take friends and family when they visit."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great decor, attentive, friendly and very prompt service. Best mole I've ever had! Too bad it was served on a green plate (a little off putting) but otherwise, splendid! We will be back and we'll be bringing friends!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner with my mom around 5. The place was already packed and we had to wait for a table, about 15 min not too bad at all. It was VERY loud when we finally got seated, I can deal with a bit of noise but man it was brutal. We had to wait about 5 minutes for menus, nobody asked us if we wanted anything to drink. Tick tick time passed... finally the waiter came by and asked us about drinks/food. By that time we were pretty hungry so we ordered apps and our main at the same time, unsure when we would get service again. We ordered the buffalo cauliflower and we each had the uncle buck burger. Everything arrived at pretty much the same time. The food was excellent, the cauliflower was delicious. The burger was good but the onion ring on the burger as over cooked and the breading fell off almost immediately. However the rest of the burger was delicious, the fries were hot and were seasoned well. After dinner the waiting began once again, it took at least 15 min to get our cheque...now the servers were VERY nice, however there just weren't enough. By the time we left there was at least 20 people waiting for tables in the little waiting space inside the door. Overall A+ on the food front...D on the lack of servers. I'll try again but on a weekday when they first open."}
{"text":"If I had a choice they'd be 2.5*. 0.5 bump up for ambiance.   Overall not bad but not that great either. Had the pulled pork chimichanga, reuben empanadas, and polenta hush puppies.  Pulled pork chimichanga: Good portion size for price. Bottom was very doughy and mushy. The pulled pork was mixed with some sort of ricotta-like cheese or maybe it was sour cream... That's how mashed together it was that I couldn't even tell. Flavours were good but overall everything was too mushy with no texture. Came with salad, and beans. Salad was really good and refreshing, beans were beans so ... Haha  Reuben empanadas: They were delicious. My only gripe is that for $8 it really wasn't worth it at all.You only get 3 small little dumplings. You could literally eat each one in one tiny small bite. For context I'm a lady who eats little lady bites. So I think that's saying something. Not worth it and would not get again. If they upped the portion or made the price more fair then yes.  Polenta hush puppies: Burnt, but insides were tasty so there's that...  Overall I don't think I'd return. Everything was almost good. Had great potential but the execution failed. Maybe they were having an off day because they have awesome reviews and it was the reason why we chose to check them out. Oh well.. next!"}
{"text":"This is exactly what the area needed.  A great restaurant with a fun atmosphere and amazing food.  Service was superb even though they were very busy.  We were there on a Friday night and there was a constant stream of people.  The place was always full, but it seemed they were always able to get people seated as soon as possible.  We waited by the bar for about 15 minutes before being seated.    The place looks great.  Our server mentioned that the owner built the place himself from scratch.  There's a great old Coca-Cola advertisement that takes up the whole east wall and is a real attention grabber.  There's a wagon wheel chandelier hanging above the bar that gives the place a feel of an old saloon.  It feels relaxed and welcoming. Although they don't have high chairs I found the place seemed to accommodate children (there were quite a few there while we were dining earlier in the evening).   Now the most important part, the food and drinks.  There's a big focus on craft beer and they do it well. Just don't go in expecting Coors like and Canadian. There's a wide selection of beers on tap that should suit most needs. I'm not much of a beer connoisseur but decided to try the Stereovision as recommended by our server and thought it was excellent.  The food was great.   We all ordered different things off the menu and everyone loved it.   I ordered the sausage (which is 2 sausages in an amazing palenta) and absolutely loved it.  Got to try bits of the Chicken sandwich (deep fried chicken on a bun) and the Pork Belly sandwich (exactly what you'd expect, pork belly on a bun) and both were great and reasonably priced.  I will definitely go back even if just for the food alone.  There are some great bars sprouting up in the area, but none with this combo of food and atmosphere.  It's easily my new favorite on the east end.  They'll have my repeat business!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a craft beer and good quality food.  I had the fish tacos and they were delicious.  Generous portions.  Service was efficient and staff were friendly.   Nice decor.  Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"We went to The Wren for brunch today and it was fantastic! Everything on the menu looked appetizing, however we settled on the Boxing Day Breakfast and the Huevos Tostadas with pulled pork. Both meals were great and we loved the atmosphere - the interior is well designed and they had a wonderful playlist going.   The service was very good and we liked how although the place filled up fast, it never felt overcrowded or like you were sitting on top of other tables which is so common in other restaurants now. It's certainly a little gem in a neighbourhood that needs it - we will definitely make the trip back to the Danforth to try the dinner menu and have a few pints!"}
{"text":"So you know when you move to a new neighborhood and you accidentally on purpose find yourself at a local spot every night for a week?  Well this was that place.   Get the burger. Get the empanada. You will dream of both forever and ever until you devour another.   I promise.   Oh and they have a supreme craft beer tap selection. It's a miracle I haven't moved right into their kitchen.   COME HERE."}
{"text":"The Wren burger is good. It reminds me of a good whopper.   However their entire menu is very spicy and they never ever tell you! Even when you ask. On several occasions i've asked the if it's spicy and they've said no. Then the food is riddled with hot peppers or chilis. When you confront them about it they don't give a s$&@ either. On one occasion they charged me for the replacement dish. Which is bad service."}
{"text":"Desperately wanted a cheeseburger and a beer, and had heard this place was good. Sat at the bar, and had a great experience. Server was super knowledgeable about the food and the beer, and accommodated requests. Service was prompt and friendly. Burger and beer were excellent."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Very good selection of craft beers. Service is awesome. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this bar. Very laid back and there is usually a table to sit at ( bar still fills up though). Servers are very down to earth and the food is great."}
{"text":"An alright-selection of beer but a neat menu and atmosphere. Our server was young and with a ponytail. Had the Mexican Flat bread special of the day. The flat bread was very hard to bite through but the toppings of tiger shrimp and avocado were yummy. I'd return for the Wren burger. Service was pleasant. Purchased my Craft Beer Passport without issues. Note - it can only be purchased in cash. Or magic beans, if you encounter the right server."}
{"text":"Great spot for top craft beer on the rising East Danforth. Nice Ontario-based selections plus some very choice bottle options.  I was encouraged by others to try the food menu here; the beef burger and the chicken sandwich were both not really for me. Same operators as Lake Inez, which is somewhere I'd be glad to eat any day.  The Wren is so friendly and convivial, I'd pop in for a brew any time to enjoy the fine atmosphere and positive attitude - I guess it's the stereotypical new Yuppie East End crowd buying into the correspondingly 'upward' local real estate (E02-E03).  Nice to see good development in this traditionally somewhat sketchy area. You can still find some run-down old shops and a few scruffy joints along this stretch (more still if you venture well east of here) but it's relatively safe & well-served by TTC underground.  Check out E02 here to learn about this transforming area: http://www.moneysense.ca/spend/real-estate/where-to-buy-toronto-real-estate-2017/"}
{"text":"After trying to come twice before, once being turned away because of a private function and the other being food is not served past 10pm we finally made it.  I had the Uncle Buck burger and it was fantastic.  Price was reasonable and the portion was a good size.  The meat was fresh and not frozen and the fries were real fresh potatoes, not frozen fries.  I would have rated it 4 stars but I was dismayed at the fact that they didn't offer refills on their soda despite it coming from a fountain.    Overall amazing food and a nice intimate atmosphere.  I will be back again one day."}
{"text":"As others have stated...great decor. What they cook they do well. Good service as well. We went there for an early dinner with our 4 kids and it was awesome."}
{"text":"Great spot on the Danforth. Their daily specials are always so delicious. Every time I go I always get that along with an appetizer. I am never disappointed. Only thing is it gets quite busy and packed in that tiny restaurant. However, well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"It's so great to see this stretch of the Danforth finally coming around. Only been waiting 16 years!!  We may be over the hump on the hipster point of view, but we do like good food and good times as the lesser bars say.  The order was:  Vodka and soda with splash of Cranberry $9 One craft beer (forget name) $8 Chimichanga (sp) $15 Burger $14  The renos look great i know they worked very hard on making this a hip place to go and I will thank them for taking on the venture in the not so nice side of the Danny.  It was busy for a Friday night around 6pm and we decided to sit on the Bar, the communal table is not for me, ok in chinatown on a one off, but if your into talking to strangers and meeting new neighbours it works.  it was working many people sitting there!   The burger was just ok, it has filler.  Too much breadcrumbs and garlic.  I prefer Burgs that are just the real deal only meat.    The chimichanga could be described as  deep fried burrito because that's what they are, the flavour was nice if your into tex mex, I really enjoyed it.  The fresh guac ontop and the salsa wasn't overpowering.  The pulled pork was not dry but not a stand out it could have been chicken.  That being said i would order this again.  The price point is very reasonable on all their menu items.  Many local families and  neighbours.   This is early days for them, and they are busy and committed to making our neighbourhood more enjoyable within walking distance.  I will definitely go back.    note: i wish the owners were their asking how everything was?  the bar staff were very friendly and accommodating.  Service was above good.  note 2:  my kids are teenagers now but as another reviewer pointed out it's nice to see kids in a resto in this stretch, her idea of a kids menu before 8pm is excellent."}
{"text":"I was here recently for the Toronto Beer Week Pub Crawl and would definitely go back again. It was the first stop of the day and it was the only one I've recommended to friends after the event.  The space is awesome, very trendy looking inside with picnic-style open area seating which makes hanging out with large groups easier. Cool artwork/decor.  Even with a large crowd the staff was super friendly and attentive to everyone and stopped by several times to make sure we had everything we needed. Excellent food, great beer selection.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Couldn't even take the time to take pictures because the food was so good. Wanted to try other places but couldn't stop coming here every night."}
{"text":"Met an old friend for drinks at The Wren, and was truly surprised at how awesome the place was. Just the right size to not feel cramped, but intimate and friendly. Super staff and service and a phenomenal menu - both craft brews and food that is a fusion of Southern (US) and Mexican. I had the Green Chili Chicken and it was incredible. Hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"I want to declare my unconditional love for The Wren. From the friendly and helpful staff to the decor and music, the fine beer list, and the food - dear lord the FOOD - every atom of this place fills me with happiness.   The Wren is my favourite food and drink destination in the world. No kidding."}
{"text":"My nephew suggested I see this new happening place called \"The Wren\" and what a nice treat. Über-fun joint and the service is really good.   We had the brisket, wren salad, sausage, and loved the food! Exceptional chicken wings too, mmmm!   Didn't try the beer but tons to choose from! Good luck, highly recommended place to visit on the Danforth."}
{"text":"Good place. I'd like to give it 4.5 stars: based on only one meal there, I would say it has the potential for 5 stars. I had polenta with an extra egg, which was great. My finacé had a very good beef hash."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last week with my friends and we had an amazing experience. The food was delicious (particularly the guacamole and the quinoa salad) and the drinks were great. I loved the Mojito made with cider!    The menu mentioned \"more vegetarian options to come,\" and I can't wait! Even though I eat meat sometimes, it's nice to have veggie options.   An early reviewer mentioned that he/she'd wished that the owners had come by their table to see if they were enjoying their meals, so I should say that while we were there the chef did come out of the kitchen several times to greet everyone. We were super impressed and we all commented after our meal on how much of a difference that makes.  It's probably equally nice for him to have a chance to be recognized for what a great menu he's designed! The rest of the staff were just as friendly and one of them introduced herself and asked all of our names.   As for the reviewers who suggest a \"kids menu,\" my husband and I think that's ridiculous. \"The Wren\" is obviously a bar, in that it boasts a great selection of craft beers and unique cocktails. It also happens to have an interesting, well-designed menu with unique flavours...why should they have to dumb that down by making a \"kids' menu?\" Why ask a chef that makes interesting twists on Southwestern food to offer \"chicken fingers?\"If your kids (or you) can't handle trying new foods, then stick to the types of restaurants that already feature a \"kids' menu.\" You can't expect every new restaurant to have to cater to your, or your children's tastes.  And before anyone assumes otherwise, we actually have two kids of our own.  Not every establishment has to be \"kid-friendly.\" It's a BAR!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food - chicken wings were a high recommendation from a friend which didn't disappoint. The southern fried chicken sandwich, lamb roti special were super yummy. The guac and chips were good but the portion was small. Another place where we really appreciated the music level was not blaring like many of the west end eateries. Glad we finally tried this place - definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Our favorite haven in the city! Just please don't tell anyone so that we all can still enjoy it ;) Awesome food, best beer selection, super friendly staff! Thank you Wren folk, whole lotta awesomeness  Ps, Monday's are burger night, just say \"yes please\"   :)"}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise in unexpected area. food is delicious with great selection of beers. we also love the service here and the chef seems to have a great imagination for creating food."}
{"text":"Weird little place... Entering the place at about 3:50 on a Sunday afternoon my girlfriend and I were met with a blank stare from the barman before he coughed out a greeting that included the kitchen was closed from 3-4 but should be opening soon. We sat and waited on service hoping to at least have a drink while we waited on food... We waited and watched as the barman read the paper and completely ignored us. Finally we went to the bar and ordered for ourselves. At 4 I guess there was a shift change and a waitress came by to take our food order... Another deer in the headlights gaze... Figuring we weren't going to stay long we ordered some buffalo cauliflower to pick at while we finished our drinks... Arrived pretty quickly but mushy and overcooked. Great food pics on the Instagram page led me here but I won't be coming back ."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great: interesting, rotating beer selection, delicious daily specials (check out their instagram), and super friendly staff! Be prepared to wait a bit for a table at peak dinner times on weekends."}
{"text":"Burger was Dynamite and the rest of the menu looked great. Great craft beer selection that's always changing. Definitely would return."}
{"text":"Excellent craft beer list with a compelling selection of sour beers.  The food is delicious and the portions are filling. Great spot on the Danforth - we need more of this in the east end!  Only drawback of this restaurant is its size. It's a popular spot, so you often have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Nice place for a beer. Absolutely rammed with patrons last Sunday afternoon. All the food coming out of the kitchen looked great.   I had a Belgian Brasserie style beee that was featured. It was quite good. Service was also quite attentive. I hope to go back and try to food."}
{"text":"This is the five star review to represent the fifth time we've been here. Never ordered the same thing and never been disappointed. Love this place."}
{"text":"I frequent this spot for after game drinks as we play at Monarch Park often.  It's superb.  When I make it there before the kitchen closes (10pm) I almost always get the fried chicken sandwich.  Fish tacos are a close 2nd.  Considerable craft beers on tap ranging from ales to porters.  The beer menu is at the board on the front, in case you were wondering.  I also love the cross-stitch art on the walls.  Wonder who made them."}
{"text":"Popular Danforth joint. Always super busy...goes to show how great the food and service is. Food is great here, service and selection of craft beers is on point. We would definitely go back. Go early to make sure you can get a seat!"}
{"text":"I went to the wren with a few friends after work.  They have a great selection of craft  beer, but unfortunately they only list their options on a board behind the bar, which can make things difficult when you're seated at a table. They really should have a beer menu at each of the tables. Their food menu is flimsy and simply a sheet of paper covered in plastic, which also seems to cheapen the experience.  They really seem to have a vendetta against menus! Weird...  I had the colonel mustard pulled pork sandwich and it was good enough, but nothing extraordinary. The fries were pretty tasty though. No one from my group loved their food, but no serious complaints to report. Just keep your expectations low.  The server was pretty laid back and well informed and seemed like a pretty nice guy. He helped us pick out our beers. The atmosphere was nice with lots of wood, fun decor, and family friendly. There were kids in pyjamas running around, and they were pretty funny/entertaining - I think they might have been one of the owner's brood. They have communal seating in the middle and separate booths and tables at the side, so you can engage with new people if you're in the mood or keep to yourself if you prefer.   I thought it was a bit overpriced and not exactly a place I'd go to on the regular, but fun enough to give a shot. They'll have to up their game once more competition sets up, but the area is still up and coming."}
{"text":"Local ingredients, house made sauces, amazing beer selection. The stretch needed a place like this and ever since it launched, it has been popular - good to see."}
{"text":"Two words: Real hollandaise. 4.5*  More words: tasty taps and eats, served by genuinely nice people who rock out to wicked music.   I've been four times and each time I've found something else to rave about. First it was the fried chicken and the music,  then the brisket, the third-time the revamped beer menu and the last visit it was the hollandaise and the oatmeal stout.  I want to keep raving about this place but, at the same time, I want everyone to stay away because it's getting too busy already.  AND they know how to make a Caesar with some kick and flavour."}
{"text":"We came for a beer and stayed for the polenta.   Everything on the menu is awesome except for the wings.  They're fine wings, but they're just wings.   Whereas the polenta and tofu is almost enough to make me think about being a vegetarian, but then I remember pork.   Service is also awesome, especially Zach.  Oh, Zach."}
{"text":"Went to visit some friends in the area and tried this place out for dinner.  I was pretty impressed with the experience.  Very friendly staff who made a few recommendations.  We all had draught beer - the selection wasn't overly creative but it was good enough.  Shared the guacamole and chips to start - delicious.  I had the pulled pork sandwich, one friend had the hamburger and one the fried chicken sandwich.  All of us finished our plates and talked about how good the food was.  Overall, a good BBQ joint in the east end.  Prices aren't very high ($13 for my pulled pork) so it's nice to see places you can get good food for reasonable prices in the area still."}
{"text":"The beer selection at The Wren is always great and getting better all of the time. The staff is always friendly and \"get\" this business. AND a walk away from home."}
{"text":"Great spot on the Danforth. Take the word pub lightly, because their food is definitely more elevated and elegant than your average pub/bar. Had brunch here. The vibe is relaxed and laid-back.   Food wise: Everything we had was fresh, and delicious. I'm always on an endless quest for the best breakfast burrito in town, and theirs is definitely a top contender! Great flavours and spice level.  Service: friendly and courteous. Would definitely return to try other dishes, for brunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Food is good but not worth the service. They treat even their regulars like garbage. I live a stones throw away and every time I go it's like I'm a stranger. I don't expect red carpet treatment of course, but a polite smile and greeting will kill you? They also never answer their phone which is always a treat. Plus looking on your Facebook page gives me no info on your menu, so please include on your site so I know what's changed. Of course they won't care about reviews because they're always packed. But don't estimate the power of a bad reputation...it'll catch up to you"}
{"text":"Hubby and I have now been two weekends in a row for brunch. Last weekend there was a huge line so we started eating at the bar until a table freed up. When it did they gave it to a family behind us which we let slide because it was a family with a baby. We decided to just stay at the bar. I ordered the Polenta and hubby had brisket. We just had coffees to drink and hubby had a bear. Food was downright amazing!!! The servers are so nice and everyone seems to enjoy the food (people were coming in and out consistently). We came this weekend again and it was a bit less busy - every table full but no line out the door!We sat at the bar again rather than waiting. I had the same dish and hubby had the Hungry Wren. Loved both again. It's become our brunch go-to!"}
{"text":"I didn't eat here but stopped for a drink with my brother. I think they had a good selection and good staff. The place is small and his limited seating but I will be back to try the food"}
{"text":"This is a great little place with decent food and great drinks. On the two separate occasions I've been there, I've had the Green Chili Chicken and the Shrimp and Haddock Cakes. Both were nice, but not quite what I had hoped for. I've had dinner with friends and gone on a date here and the setting is equally nice for either type of outing. They serve Ontario craft beers here, and they do brunch. I would love to check that out. Thus far, I find this to be a good place to go for drinks and to share some apps!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food; lovely service; excellent atmosphere. I had the buffalo cauliflower bites and the pulled pork chimichanga--amazing. Price was very reasonable, too."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent beer selection, good service and delicious food."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a Sunday. Service was quick and friendly. My 7 year old son and I split an Uncle Buck burger. It was epic. Super tasty beef cooked perfectly to medium bordering med-rare. We subbed salad vs fries and the house salad was very nice and included an onion jam that was pretty much mind blowing.   Nice selection of local beers. I had the West Avenue heritage dry cider.  I am a huge cider fan and I didn't like it at all, next time I will stick with the local Thornvury in a can vs the West Ave on tap.   It's not cheap, but if you are a looking for great quality local food. Then this is the spot for you.   One hamburger with a pint of cider and side salad was $26."}
{"text":"My favourite pub on the Danforth. One of the most eclectic and interesting tap lists and the food is always awesome and changing. Be sure to have the guac!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We came here on a Thursday night and it was pretty busy. We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, but we managed to snag a seat at a bar and had a drink while we waited. Servers are very friendly and easy going.   We ordered the guacamole and chips to start. A generous portion and chunky, just the way I like it, with pieces of tomato and onion added for flavour. Our mains came shortly after our appetizer. Extra points for good timing. Our server suggested we get the fried chicken sandwich and pulled pork chimichanga. The fried chicken sandwich was HUGE! Totally worth the price. It was juicy, tender, and so yummy. The fries it came with are fresh cut and also very good. The pulled pork chimichanga was delicious, too. A good portion of pulled pork inside. The chimichanga came with a side of house salad and beans. I really enjoyed the salad; it was fresh and the dressing was light. The beans were alright. They were... beans.   Can't wait to try their brunch.   Oh, and they serve Left Field here. Extra points!"}
{"text":"Went back to the wren on labor day. Had the southern fried chicken sandwich, which didn't quite meet up to its $13 price tag. My wife had the green mole again, which was fine. The tab for the two dishes and two beers was $50 with tip, which seems a bit much for what you're getting. I really like the place--nice vibe and good service--but the dishes don't quite deliver at their price points."}
{"text":"Such a welcome addition to the neighbourhood! My boyfriend lives in Phoenix, so I've been dying for a taste of Southwest back at home. And boy, The Wren does not disappoint.   Everything I've eaten here has been on point. Do not miss out on the Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich, Pulled Pork Chimichanga or whatever the daily special i (it's almost always flawless). They have an unreal beer selection too.    My only complaint is that the kitchen closes so early! I'd love a place in the east end where I can get late night eats besides shawarma, pizza or McDicks. Guess I'll have to settle by ordering 5+ orders of guac and chips instead."}
{"text":"I popped in with a friend for the first time last night; I live right around the corner and I am unsure what took me so long to visit.    I'd like to think I know a little something about beer but my friend is a bit of a brew snob.  He was pretty impressed with the selection and really enjoyed the Moroccan Brown (?) that is apparently really hard to find on tab.  (I also had it and would agree it was one of the best beers I've had in a while, especially among winterish types of beer).      The dark lager I tried next, was not nearly as good.  But again, kudos for having interesting beers that are hard to come by in Toronto.  A pint was $7.50--totally fair for what you are enjoying.  On a Saturday evening, at about 9pm, the place was pretty lively--you might want a backup plan in pocket if you are coming out just in case you can't get a seat.  (The staff seemed on top of things and I didn't witness anyone leave without getting a table).  Highly recommended if you are in the area looking for a piece of Ossington hipness without crossing the Don or going south to Queen.  Worth coming out for?  Perhaps.  I'd need to try the food to be sure but it seems like you won't be dissappointed if you are the kind of foodie who doesn't mind a little TTC action before sinking into a meal."}
{"text":"I usually come here with my friends for drinks, and I am never disappointed. The staff is attentive and willing to answer any questions and recommend a great drink. Although it can get very busy at times, I am willing to wait for a table because I love it here. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because I wish the place was bigger!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim after driving by the area. There was a lot of people and we wanted to check it out.   We had to wait maybe 20 min to be seated (10pm on a Friday night) as there was a mix up with the seating.   Ordered the \"A Long December\" cocktail which was good on a chilly day.   The staff is very friendly and energetic."}
{"text":"Amazing chorizo eggs benny on weekends...amazing daily specials...great wings, burgers, appies, etc. A beer lover's delight."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I've been here 4 times so far: twice for dinner and drinks with no toddler, and twice for brunch with toddler.  All the food I've tried (my own order and tasting my dining partner's) has been great, and I love their cocktails. I've tried the beef brisket sandwich, the southern fried chicken sandwich, the hungry Wren breakfast (which they also made vegetarian for my cousin), and one of the daily specials (can't remember but it was yummy!).   I love the decor and the staff are always friendly and have made me feel very welcome whether my kid was with me or not."}
{"text":"Finding myself on a rarely made trip to the east end, I decided to make a stop in to the Wren as this place has been intriguing me for a while. One thing that was surprising on arrival is how small the room actually is. Pictures online make it seem bigger, so I was a bit surprised to arriving around 6pm and the place already being full with a waiting list for a table. Luckily there was room at the bar for me to saddle up alongside.  This place was on my radar as it's been known for it's craft beer selection, and on that front it did not disappoint at all. They had about a dozen craft options including options from great Ontario brewers such as Indie Ale House, GLB, Bellwoods, Side Launch, and Redline to name a few. Beers range in 12, 14, or 16 oz pours depending on what you fancy.  Foodwise, I ordered the Uncle Buck Burger which is their premium burger topped with a friend onion ring and some bacon and white cheddar cheese amongst other things. On first look, I thought this was going to be the best burger I've had in ages. It had plate appeal, juicy meat and some decent looking fries on the side. It was a good burger, but admittedly I'm not sure if it was the thousand island dressing (which I normally am down with), but something just seemed a bit off in its flavour. It was still enjoyable, but fell a bit short which is the sole reason I've got to stick with a 4 star review.  But the place is quaint and cute and the service is friendly. I've also heard the fried chicken is crazy good, so I'm already looking for a good reason to come back to this side of town."}
{"text":"Great spot. Staff is friendly and professional. The beer on tap is always good. The fried chicken sandwich is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great casual and fun atmosphere with good service. We had the pull pork sandwich special and pork chimichanga with some Canadian flars. The pull pork was smokey (a bit too much for me) and the tortilla is a bit thick, but both dishes were well prepared and tasty. We live in the SW of the US so we have different standards when it comes to BBQ and Mexican food! Lots of beer on tap which I appreciated."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, friendly staff, decent prices, large portions and my fried chicken sandwich was juicy and flavourful. Nice addition to the neighbourhood. I'll be back for brunch."}
{"text":"So great to have this fixture on the Danforth.  As a somewhat regular from the neighbourhood, I've never had a bad experience here. The food is as good as it looks on Instagram. Staff are all friendly and use great timing to make sure everything is running well. I've been here in a party of 2/3/4/6 and have always been accommodated. There is an ever-changing taps board to choose from when you come in, tho I tend to go back to my usual picks.   You may want to go elsewhere if you show up and there's a line-up for a table, so come early. It also gets noisy just because of the space."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my one visit to The Wren.  My coworkers and I were wining and dining some out-of-town affiliates of our company and we landed on this nifty little place along the Danforth. As we were all pretty amiable towards beer, all of us left this place pretty satisfied.  I'm no beer geek, but some of the coworkers are, and they had nothing but approving nods for the beer selection at the Wren. Since the corporate credit card was thrown down, I had the leisure of trying out a wide variety of beer, and all of the bartender's recommendations were spectacular. I personally liked the Ion Cannon, a breezy, summery beer from Halo Brewery down by the Junction, but I digress.  Oh! One more thing: try the barbecue cauliflowers. I'm not even vegan, but I'd take these over a pound of wings any day. Just spicy enough to wake you up and packed with flavour. I think you'd enjoy it."}
{"text":"Five stars for food and value. One star for service. Walked in waited to be seated about 10 mins before someone would even acknowledge us at the front. Servers made eye contact, but didn't even bother to ask us if we were looking for a table. I finally had to walk to the back near the washroom and ask if we could be seated. After we were seated service was fine then. Food was great. Excellent menu, great value. Love the beer menu."}
{"text":"cozy vibe wide beer selection good burgers  all ruined by a bad stout cake... it was like a left over cake from a 4 year old's birthday party. dry chocolate cake with sad colour sprinkles and cream on the side **sadface**"}
{"text":"I wanted to really like The Wren, I really did. But I gotta say, in between the mouthwatering beer offerings, the much raved grub, and the beaten-to-death laminated food menu, service can be.. uh.. spotty.  Always popular, always packed is a common theme for this Danforth diner since it opened. And it was even featured on \"You Gotta Eat Here\" on the Canadian Food Network. It's only now that I have gotten a chance to come and snag a seat and see for myself why I gotta eat here.  But I gotta say, it seems the level of service afforded to you depends where you sit. Of course you are unmissable sitting at the bar. It's when you are at the front window when staff attention drops to nearly zero. Amongst the chaos of an average Friday evening, where people do queue up inside for an open table, they actually thought for more than 10 minutes I was waiting for other people, no wonder I was menu-less for so long! It wasn't just me struggling for a server--a couple beside me took a few tries to snag someone so they can get some food finally. Maybe they need to zone out their space, I dunno--several staff were playing host, it was all over the place.  The 'Uncle Buck Burger' ($16) I settled for was stacked with a large beer battered onion ring, which had this interesting smoky caramel flavour to it. A bitty bit of Thousand Islands dressing added, it was not very effective. It was alright, not as mindexpanding as anticipated but bit of a beast to eat, and comes with some very crispy crisp fries.  The Wren has a varied patron base of different age groups reflective of one big part of the Danforth community... and maybe a few greasy foodies thrown in there somewhere. They may have a reputation for interesting grilled comfort foods, but still needs to work on handling a busy night effectively, lest I feel like a true poltergeist.  {TTC: around the corner from Greenwood subway station}"}
{"text":"Come here all the time for brunch. I've never been disappointed. People say the service isn't good but I've never had an issue. The staff here are super personable and friendly. It's a busy spot for brunch, so go in with that expectation, but nothing less.   The food is high quality, super tasty, and very creative. Unique Tex-mex brunch that sets the bar high for TO \"brunch spots\".   I suggest the uncle buck burger, cotija crepe, or the polenta and sausage. Can't go wrong (a bit salty though)! Good bottomless coffee too. I'd love to come back for fried chicken sandwich week whenever that happens again!"}
{"text":"I had a splendid time here on a Thursday night. It was busy but we were quickly seated at the bar. For drinks, I had a caesar and it was ok. And for dinner, I had the uncle buck burger and it was so delicious! The service was efficient and friendly. Overall, I had a great time here and would love to return to try some of their other stuff."}
{"text":"Was at the Wren for a meetup on a week night. The beer is pretty good and the pork chimichanga is delicious!"}
{"text":"fabulous food...fantastic decor...great service  Me and my girlfriend walked in randomly once and I'm glad we did...'tis my favourite restaurant in the city"}
{"text":"I had the brisket platter, I really enjoyed the hush puppies and the beans but the brisket was crazy dry (had to ask for bbq sauce) and the coleslaw really had no taste. We were sat at the 'harvest' table like it was an honour and man did I not like it. I do not care to eat with strangers and sit at a picnic table in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Their vegetarian entree is actually a well-thought-out, tasty unique meal, not something thrown together to satisfy the veg-heads. All the food we had was great, and a lovely selection of beers. Really nice guys too. This place has it going on."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times, sometimes with our 4yrs and 6yrs old daughters. Good food, family friendly during the day, great place for drinks at night. Like the decor and the atmosphere, plus the friendly staff."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! Good food, atmosphere, service and honest price! I'll be returning soon with my family again."}
{"text":"It was a regular Wednesday night in the big city. After going for drinks, my friend and I were hungry. This place was on social media and we were both curious.   We drove down the Danforth and spent about 20 minutes going back and forth looking for parking. There was ZERO on-street parking available. We drove down to the nearest green p lost which was kinda far. It was about a 15 minute walk.   We walked in to a very small bumping restaurant, bar stools were taken by upbeat folks and the back was loud and busy. We waited about 20 minutes for a table, while waiting we ordered a drink at the bar. Bar service was good. My only compliant was it was very squished.   Finally we got called to our table. A squished seat in between 2 other couples on a picnic bench. We ordered the Guac and Chips which were average.   My friend and I were here to try the Uncle Buck Burger; charred beef burger, with onions rings, pickles, thousand island dressing, bbq sauce and bacon. Sounds great right?   It looked and sounded delicious. I was down! The fries were also delicious; crispy the way I like it. My only compliant about the burger is the meat lacked some flavour and it was too charred for my liking. The toppings worked well.   What I didn't like is my overall experience; the seating, the small space, the no parking.   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants on Danforth. I've been here three times and never left disappointed or feeling hungry. The Chimichanga is hands down the best thing on their menu. Can't wait to come back and try some of the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars overall, but for the neighbourhood its definitely a 5+!  For months I have been waiting in anticipation for the opening of this place as I had been bemoaning the lack of nicer restaurant/bar options in the neighbourhood since moving there a couple of years ago. After what seemed like an eternity, The Wren finally opened and I went to check it out Saturday of opening week.  We arrived around 9 PM and the place was busy (it appeared to have been busy all week which I was glad to see). The crowd looked young and hip and everyone seemed to be having a great night.  The owners did a great job with the renovations in this space - a nice mix of reclaimed wood, subtle wallpaper, eclectic light fixtures and the coolest old Coca-Cola wall mural (that would have been an exterior building wall at some point, likely in the early 1900s) that they uncovered when doing the renovations and plan to seal and preserve.  We waited at the bar for roughly 15 minutes for a table to open up, though it is possible to order food at the bar as well. They had a nice selection of local beers on tap, didn't take a close look at the wine selection.  Service was super friendly, attentive and polite.  The menu is not huge but has a good variety of options, with quite a few hearty sandwich selections. The PBLT (pork belly, lettuce and tomato) sandwich sounded delicious but was unfortunately sold out for the evening.  My husband ordered the beef brisket sandwich with fries ($15), which tasted incredible. Tender, smokey and delicious. The locally sourced bread was a little too substantial, but when the owner Dennis stopped to chat with us and get our feedback on our experience that night (which I think is excellent and the sign of a business focused on succeeding) he noted that they're thinking of switching up the bread to a slightly lighter option.  Not being a huge dinner sandwich fan myself, I ordered the pulled pork chimichanga ($15), which arrived golden and beautifully plated. The pulled pork filling was a tad sweeter than I was expecting (though not too sweet by any means) but given that it was pulled pork it made sense and I enjoyed it. Like, inhaled-the-entire-thing enjoyed it. :)  The chimichanga was topped with this awesome, flavourful guacamole that I'm hoping is the same guac that can be ordered from the menu separately with chips. The black beans that came on the side were amazing. I was fully expecting to take a couple of bites of them and then ignore them, but they were so perfectly seasoned and not overcooked that I finished them all.  Not realizing how huge the portions would be, we also ordered the quinoa salad, which consisted of seasoned quinoa with jicama, watercress, charred corn and chimichurri dressing. The salad was enormous. Definitely large enough for a meal for someone looking for a filling vegetarian option. Loved the freshness and crunch of the salad, though found it a touch heavy on the red onions and light on acidity in the dressing.   The Wren is definitely a welcome addition to the changing landscape of businesses along the stretch of Danforth between Greenwood and Coxwell and I expect it will only get better with time.  Overall a very positive dining experience and I will be back for sure (with friends!)."}
{"text":"The Wren does brunch! How exciting to have a cool brunch place you might find in The Junction or on Ossington right here in Greenwood-Coxwell strip of the Danforth. Our friends suggested this place for brunch and I'm glad we came.   The decor is urban-inspired country (when you decorate a place like a barn). There is lots of seating (3 booths, four tables of four, huge back booth, and one long family-style table that could seat 20?)  We arrived at opening on Saturday, at 11am and the place was already starting to fill up. Lots of families with babies! But by the time we left at 12:30 it wasn't at capacity. I think the brunch here is still a bit of a hidden gem at the moment.  The food is traditional brunch food, but with a little tex-mex twist. They have a great take on the breakfast burrito and the heuvos rancheros were tasty with homemade salsa and pico de gallo. I was salivating over the apple waffles. I like a menu that gives me enough must-try dishes to keep me interested and coming back.  I haven't been for dinner, but was told the brunch menu was superior to the dinner menu. So definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"great gastropub. Great service and special food. I'll be back.  If you've got a larger group (5+) grab the booth at the back."}
{"text":"3.5 rounded up to 4.  I've had two visits to the Wren now, which is still looking pretty lonely in its stretch of the Danforth, so it's nice to have a good eating option prior to imbibing at The Only.  The FOOD:  Well one visit was super awesome and the other was pretty \"meh\".  Our first visit had a chill special on the menu that rocked my world.  Meaty, fiery, unafraid of flavour....simply awesome.  Others were also generally quite pleased with their food.  The second visit was much more markedly a miss.  For burger week, I had something that tasted vaguely reminiscent of McDonald's, but priced at $15 with fries.  The green chile chicken, while flavourful wasn't exactly what we were expecting, and the portion was a little smallish.  Overall, a bit disappointed.  The BEER: Their beer list is above average, focusing on local Ontario beers.  That being said, going out with a group of beer geeks, we generally could only find 1 beer at a time on the menu that any of us that was impressive. or novel, but let's not be too hard on them.    The SERVICE: Universally pretty good.  The male servers are all in the lumbersexual style.  They handled a member of our party being given a beer he ended up hating super well...simply replacing it without complaint.  That's good service, I'd say.  The AMBIANCE:  Rustic chic.  Yes, there are wooden benches and Edison bulbs.  I don't mind, it's nice and casual and has a volume where conversation is still possible.    OVERALL, I'm hoping the food was just a bit of a blip.  I'll update after a couple more visits.  After all, if you plan to sample the excellent samplers at The Only, where else are you going to go for dinner nearby?"}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch! Will try dinner next time. Ingredients tasted fresh and were freshly prepared, well presented and delicious! Beautiful menu. We had the beef hash and also the polenta. Hip decor. Good staff. I think they have acoustic tiles on the ceiling, so not too noisy either! It was brunch so there is a family style to it but the kids were well behaved and there was no goop on the floor or the chairs either!    I gave it a 5 star  for all of the above and their mid range price point, which is great for this locale. It is such a wonderful addition to the licensed, current, food starved east end and they seem to be getting it right! Really hoping they continue to do so.   Just go!"}
{"text":"Oh man, where to start... it's hard to describe how awesome our brunch at the Wren was. The Wren burger was excellent, but pulled pork polenta was on another level.  Service was fast and polite and the atmosphere is great. I live nowhere near this place but I want to go back as soon as possible"}
{"text":"The Wren has a great vibe to it and the food is unique and inventive. I want to come back time and again until I've tried everything on the menu. A must visit in my book."}
{"text":"Recommended by my neighbor, my wife and I were children free and looking for a place to fill our bellies. Ended up at The Wren on and early Sunday afternoon, place was busy but didn't mind sitting at the bar, well, because I normally sit at the bar. However we we're quickly waited on and had a copious selection of beers and other fine drinks. We decided to try their Cesar, it was excellent and the heat was modified for our individual pallets. I had the Uncle Buck Burger and my wife had the Polenta dish. Now I could go on and on about all the toppings on the Buck but for me it was about the variety of different flavors in each bite, the fries were amazing, I'm sure they use some kind of lemon pepper zest but it was to die for. My wife's meal was also amazing but I'll let her review her own. So I gave this place 4 out of 5 not because anything was wrong, but because, who gets 5 stars anyways."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to meet up here as a way to have a good catch-up, and eat food that could meet our numerous food sensitivities (between the three of us, we're non-gluten, non-dairy, and a bunch of other random sensitivities). Despite it being a Tuesday night, the place was full and we had to wait a bit for a table. Once we were seated, the server explained the specials, and asked if we had any questions. We asked about what was in which dish, and he answered honestly and earnestly, without any push back or pretentiousness, which I've experienced in other restaurants. My friends each ordered the fried chicken sandwich, which I was told was very delicious. I myself am gluten and dairy-free, so ordered a side of guacamole and chips, and dry-spiced chicken wings. Unfortunately, I hadn't asked specificaly whether these were breaded (they are!) and so was unable to eat them. Again our server was very accomodating, and sent them back without any trouble whatsoever. He then sat with me to figure out what I could eat, and then worked with the kitchen to come up with something (green salad, no dressing and a very flavourful piece of grilled chicken breast). The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was because my second dish took quite a while to come out (my friends were finished eating by the time it arrived), and we had to hunt the server down for our bill after waiting quite a while. Other than that, the place is very homey and comfortable, a great place to have a nice dinner with friends, and has good food, and great service."}
{"text":"The various burger offerings at The Wren seem to be constantly highlighted on Instagram, so it was just a matter of time before I found myself sitting down for a meal.  (Ironically, I didn't even order a burger.)  We arrived just before noon on a Saturday and the place was already bustling. After sitting down at one of the last free tables, I perused the menu and quickly decided to order the Brisket Hash (\"shredded beef brisket, potato, onion, and seasonal vegetables. Served with warm cornbread & two sunny side up eggs\").  It's a good dish, although it saddens me to say that it was not served hot. It was barely room temperature when I received it, and this continues to be one of my biggest pet peeves at restaurants. (Seriously, how difficult is it to serve a hot meal hot?)  Anyway, the food is otherwise very tasty. The hash is quite flavorful and packed with tasty elements, although the beef brisket itself was a little on the sparse side. (I quite enjoyed the innovation of using french fries in place of potatoes, which gave the whole thing a kind of poutine-like feel.) The cornbread is decent, especially for Toronto. (I don't think I've ever had cornbread in the city that even comes close to the stuff you get in the States.)  I should also mention that the service was fairly subpar, as my dining companion's water glass sat empty for more than half the meal."}
{"text":"my new favourite bar in a cool part of town. so glad that danforth/coxwell gets a trendy, popular bar with great food, a cool crowd and a fantastic beer selection. keep up the great work, especially the brunch menu."}
{"text":"Certainly one of the best bars on the Danforth. Great energy any day you go in here. Gets stupid busy on weekend nights but that's because there's not enough awesome bars on Danforth just yet. The craft beer selection is great but it's the food that really impressed me. It's not typical pub fare and changes a lot. Lots of interesting ingredients and spices you don't typically see in most pub food, and it's really really good. Bonus: they always play great music, and don't just blast top 40. You can count on a good night at The Wren."}
{"text":"I visited The Wren a couple of years ago. The food was terrific, the service was fast,  efficient and friendly. Based on my prior good experience, I met a friend there to do it again.   It was a Friday night, before 6:00. Not crazy busy. Special was shrimp po' boy with fries and that sounded good so both my friend and I ordered it. They have chimichurri fries on the menu, and I thought that would be a yummy upgrade from plain fries. When I asked the server to upgrade, she said \"Yeah... that SEEMS like something we could do but there are no substitutions.\" Uhhhh... it's not a substitution, it's an add-on, for which I'm gladly willing to pay. I'm not sure who's idea it is to deny upgrades (either the kitchen is lazy or the server is lazy) but it's a poor one, especially when it isn't busy. It also cost the server a few % in tips from both my friend and I.  Normally I wouldn't care about such things, but it was an indication of things to come. The fries were overcooked *chimichurri would have helped*. The bun for the po' boy was not soft, but not warm and toasted either; it was just dry like it had been sitting out in the open all day. The shrimp was greasy. The \"fried cauliflower\" we got as a side was limp, soft and greasy also.   I didn't enjoy the server's attitude and the food was disappointing. Not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Cool craft beers, and an interesting menu! (how many restaurants offer chimmichungas?) Nice small bar on the Danforth."}
{"text":"Went here last week for my fiances birthday with some friends as we've been meaning to try it for some time and I heard amazing things. Everything was just.. OK. I had the Guadalajara chilaquiles and the nacho chips were so soggy I had to eat them with a fork. It got too much in the end so I just left it. 2 others in the party ordered the green chili chicken, this had decent flavour but came with some very bland flatbread. Really needed some time or something for the sauce. My fiance ordered a falafel meal where all the components came separated on the plate, he wasn't a fan of it. They have some cool beer selections. Service was pretty slow, we had to wait 15/20 mins which is to be expected on a Friday night in a small venue. Don't think I'd return, if I did I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Weekend brunch is not bad. Prepare to wait if you don't come right at opening time. Staff is friendly in general. Food is a hit or miss. The potato hash is alway delicious though."}
{"text":"What's not to like about this place? I've been here for brunch, dinner & drinks. Their menu is well priced with amazing dinner specials. I especially enjoy their brunch menu. Service is always great, staff are friendly & the food comes out pretty quickly. Bonus points for their ever changing tap menu!"}
{"text":"Tasty Mexican inspired food. Good craft beer selection. Bustling atmosphere.  I had been to The Wren before for wings and beer, and it was a fine time. Tonight I went back for a proper meal, and I quite enjoyed it. I got the Turkey Sausage with Cheddar Jalapeño Polenta, and my girlfriend got the Pulled Pork Chimichanga. Both tasted great, and had a lot of flavour. Both dishes had some delicious spiced black beans, which had just the write amount of liquid. The black beans paired perfectly with the cheesy polenta, and both elements really anchored the dish. It was complimented by some pretty spicy Turkey sausage, some crispy tortillas for crunch, and some salsa fresca (tomato, onion, cilantro, etc) and microgreens for freshness. My brother had the Shrimp and Haddock Cakes which he thought was okay.  The space is fun and contains a lot of rustic charm with the walls and the chandlers containing a lot of old character. Its very inviting and so was the staff. It was pretty busy on a Saturday night, so you might want to try more off hours. Also they do a burger special on Mondays. Though their Mexican style food is good enough that I'm unsure if I'd want to order a burger."}
{"text":"Every time I've been to The Wren it's been for either a tap takeover or part of a pub/bar crawl.  I recently found myself there for yet another tap takeover, so I figure it's about time I reviewed the venue.  The Wren is small and not particularly upscale (except for the washroom).  It does, however, boast both a great beer selection and great food.  It's also in a convenient location, being not too far east of Greenwood subway station and also nearby a number of other bars, etc.  As I've only been to the venue for the aforementioned special Events, it's always been or became quite crowded while I was there but I can't recall service - either at the bar or tables - having ever been quite negatively impacted as a result.  Due to its size, I don't recommend The Wren for large(r) Groups unless you can snag at least 1 of the picnic tables in the center of their seating area.  The noise level, predictably does become quite high when the place is pretty crowded.  I definitely recommend The Wren if you haven't been and find yourself in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Their breakfast burito is not really hot.  It was still semi cold.  The polenta was kind of blend even with the toppings."}
{"text":"Good little spot.  We were there on a very cold night.  We arrived with a party of 4 and were told there was room in the middle of one of the bench seats.  We opted to wait the promised 10 - 15 minutes.  We were offered drinks and started to wait.  More and more groups showed up and it got very busy in the waiting area.  There was a table at the back of the restaurant that we asked about after we'd waited 20 minutes and  were told it was for groups of 5 or more... we were 4. After a long wait we got our table right beside the big table at the back.  The big table sat empty as we ate our dinner.  The food was good pub food and it was a cozy spot.  I was personally really frustrated with the wait and would have been more frustrated if a group of 5 had shown up to be seated before us after waiting the half hour plus for a table.  I would not rush back to the The Wren as I did my think it was anything special."}
{"text":"I have been here before for dinner and today I went back for brunch. The brunch ends at 3pm and we went in just in time before they changed to dinner menu.   The food is good but for those who do not drink, they have a very limited drinks menu, just OJ and the usual coffee and tea. The tea options are also extremely limited and they are Lipton.   We had the wren burger, eggs Benedict with pulled pork and peameal bacon sandwich. They were all good but my favourite was the eggs Benedict which came with salad and fries. I loved the hollandaise sauce!   My only complaints are the service and the fact that they didn't have that many non-alcoholic drinks for brunch. Otherwise, a great place for brunch and a few beers for dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious burgers and sandwiches. I was worried this was one of those places with gorgeous, Instagram worthy dishes that don't live up to the hype, but my fear was totally unfounded. Great fries, perfect if you love them with malt vinegar. Love the beer selection."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times.  1st time was only for drinks and it was really good. They have a lot of local beers on tap and the bar tenders know the beers well 2nd time, I got a bit adventurous and decided to order a meal along with beers. The items sounded really good on the menu and I was excited to try it. I ordered a fried chicken sandwich and was soon very disappointed. The chicken was rock solid. It was over battered and over fried. After barely keeping my teeth in my mouth from biting through the sandwich, I decided to never order food from here again. My wife had a similar experience with her meal as well (very nice description on the menu, very underwhelming in front of her).   I've Returned here for drinks only a few more times and worked up to ordering a side of fries. The portion was good and fried nicely.   Atmosphere: 5 star.  Drinks : 5 star  Food. Maybe 2.5 stars. I'm still a bit scared to try a whole meal here again.   I really want to give them a 5 star, but I still have my reservations."}
{"text":"Great spot with interesting and delicious food. Nice friendly atmosphere and staff. Quality."}
{"text":"We moseyed on over to The Wren for an East end dinner on a week night.  Arriving around 6:30pm, we saddled up to a communal table but moments later, a table for two opened up.  For grub, we ordered the Southern Fried Chicken sandwich ($13) and the special which was simillar to nachos with pulled pork and chorizo ($12).  Impressed with The Wrens long list of craft brews.  I tried the Kensington Watermelon Wheat.  We found the food very salty.  Fries that came with the sandwich got a heavy dusting of seasoning salt and nacho chips were also super salty.  Thank god for the beer to wash it all down but I'm not sure I'd return for a meal.  Giddy up, Salt Lick!"}
{"text":"Loved this spot. Not much else going on at Danforth and Greenwood, but The Wren seems more like an Ossington strip type of place.  Great tunes (lots of Beatles) pumping just loud enough to hear but not so loud that you couldn't converse.   Didn't try the food this time, just had a couple delicious pints of Amsterdam Blonde.   Place was packed on a Thursday night, so I imagine weekends are damn fun!"}
{"text":"My husband is definitely in charge of brunch spots now. He found this spot for brunch since it was closeish to our day destination of Tommy Thompson Park. The space and decor is very cute and follows the trend of most restaurant in Toronto: lots of wood, whimsical nods to the rural life, mismatched service (as in plates and cutlery), communal tables (they have booths as well).  The menu is fairly small, which I love! It makes it so much easier to order and you have a sense that the kitchen will put effort into each dish. Service was okay, not stellar but definitely not bad. We were taken care of just fine.  We had the Hungry Wren Breakfast and the Jalapeno and Cheddar Polenta. GET THE POLENTA. I love polenta for breakfast and I thought I was the only one until I saw the menu. Man this was just a treat. Creamy, cheddar infused and jalapeno spiked polenta topped with a buttload of pulled pork and a perfectly poached egg. Unfortunately, the pulled pork was a bit too salty for me so more than half went to the man. The man enjoyed his Hungry Wren with a note that the sausage was the least interesting thing on the plate. I tried some of his baked beans and tea biscuits - yum!  My few notes to the kitchen would be: less salt for the pulled pork and get rid of the tortilla chip garnish. Other than that, don't change a thing. Ever. Always keep the polenta on the menu. I will be back."}
{"text":"Waiter is relaxed yet mindblowingly quick. The atmosphere is really chill.  Friend ordered a chicken sandwich which was more of a burger. Huge and tastes great. Had the house burger myself. The beef is as beefy as it gets. Woudl definitely go again if i'm in the area."}
{"text":"tried the wren with a group of friends. it was quite busy but it was a friday night. i wouldn't recommend this place for big groups. it's a cozy little place.  for appetizers, we ordered. popcorn chicken, calamari, and guac and chips. all 3 were good but the guac stood out to me the most. it tasted extremely healthy. very fresh. loved it  my main was the pulled pork chimichanga had a salad for the side and also came with some beans. the chimichanga was topped with sour cream and more guac. i love guac so i was a happy camper but really, the chimichanga was delicious. me likey."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday and it was very special.  Zac was a really nice waiter and made sure we got our food hot from the oven.  Everything on the brunch menu sounds delicious, making for a hard choice when it comes time to order. Ultimately, it's hard to go wrong and the servings are more than generous.  Try the speciality beers on tap, just ask your server - they know what they're talking about."}
{"text":"Located on the Danforth, the Wren whipped up one of the best meals I've had in a while. It's a very hipsterish bar-restaurant with a full bar and long tables and booths for those coming to dine. The menu has a nice selection of Canadian dishes. I had the turkey sausage and polenta (boiled cornmeal) and it was delicious. My friend had the Southern Fried Chicken and it was a huge portion. The crowd was mid 20's to mid 30's and there was even a nursing mother with her husband; *somebody's* not afraid to pop it out and feed their baby! -The service was pleasant but a bit slow, but it was understandable as it was a busy evening. The decor included mismatched salt and pepper shakers, which was cute.   Pro Tip 1: Portions are huge! We had ordered the guacamole and chips appetizer - even though this was phenomenal - it was a bit too much with our mains.   Pro Tip 2: They don't take Amex.   Pro Tip 3: Right next door is a fantastic local trendy pub called Sauce. Head there for drinks when you're done here."}
{"text":"Kitchen closed so early on a Saturday?! We were at The Wren around 10:30 ish and was advised that we can only drink our beers but unable to order any food.  The saving grace though was a good selection of local craft beers for $5 a pint!   Service was excellent but sadly I could not drink more on my empty stomach... My Drinking Buddy though down 3 pints of Side Launch Wheat in 30 minute.   Will definitely be back for more beers when I am in the area, especially during special event they hosts and of course to try out their food!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer and some great food. I had the jerk chicken sandwich and it did not disappoint. The server was not charismatic, but she was incredibly efficient and quick. I swear she brought me a new beer before the words \"I'd like another\" were out of my mouth. Stellar. The atmosphere is dim, and cozy and the kind of place you can really see yourself setting down roots. Have a seat, get a cold one, and talk the night away."}
{"text":"The food was great. Had the hot chicken sandwich and my partner had the chimichanga and both were delicious.  The hot chicken sauce was super spicy but they serve it in the side.   Would recommend."}
{"text":"Veeeeery good place. The hamburger are sooooo good! Highly recommended! Good environment, nice bartenders. The service was very good. Just One thing, you had better get early to get a table."}
{"text":"The good news is that the service is really good and the room is comfortable.   The bad news is that the food was... Weird, verging on bad.  We went here for brunch today and despite being there 5 minutes before they opened, there was a line up at the door. They were great about seating everyone quickly and getting drink orders. The staff really knew the menu well and were able to answer questions easily. I ordered the huevo tostatos and my other half asked for the brisket hash.  Considering every seat was filled and there already was a line up at the door, the food came out within a reasonable time. It was plated well, too. But....   The hash was cold. Straight up cold. The cornbread was warmer.  And mine? It was closer to pumpkin pie than Mexican. I couldn't taste anything other than cinnamon and cardamom. No cumin, no pepper, just pumpkin pie spice. Ick!"}
{"text":"Good menu variety. I had beef brisket which was tasty although a little bit too much artificial smoke used the homemade pickles and coleslaw for very good the potato salad was mediocre. My friend had the chimichanga which he like very much pulled pork inside in a fried shell. However the problem is it's Extremely Loud they have speakers all over and music blaring and it was Sunday afternoon I have been there other times for a drink when there has been lots of people and that was quite unbearable to try to have a conversation. Better as a pub than a restaurant"}
{"text":"Come hungry my friend!  Massive dripping burgers, big bossy empanadas - this is a haven for the thirsty and starving!  Intimate, wood lined, skinny and loud.  The kids loved it, the parents celebrated and the after work crowd rid themselves of the day.  If you go here you are likely to never read this review because it feels like one of the anchors of the neighbourhood. Come and be a local.  Raise a pint. Enjoy the Uncle Buck burger that would satisfy even John Candy and enjoy the great service."}
{"text":"Stopped by with a friend on a weeknight. Very nice variety of beer, but not much else. The kitchen was closed by the time we arrived so I can't comment on their food, either. Note that I arrived well over an hour before closing time, and was starving having worked a night shift. So the complete lack of food costed them a star.   The service was impeccable, however. Not only did the barmaid possess a very kind demeanour, she went the extra mile to give me some extra beer when I (embarrassingly)  spilled a third of my cup. Service is what brings customers back, and The Wren has it nailed down!"}
{"text":"The owner or our Air B&B suggested this place and it was spot on. Folks were super friendly, great beer list to choose from, amazing service and the food was excellent. The smash burger was excellent and when the waitress offered malt vinegar for my fries I was in heaven!"}
{"text":"Tried this after my son recommended as he follows them on instagram.  The beer selection was excellent and I tried the pulled pork chimichanga.  I'm not a huge chimichanga fan but it was memorable with a great flavor profile and balance.  Paired with a black cream ale which was a good choice and recommended by the bartender.  Service was excellent and looking forward to coming back and trying some the burgers, which look really great.  Would definitely recommend and will be returning."}
{"text":"On our first trip to Toronto my friend and I stood in the area by chance. We ended up loving the food so much that we returned the next day for brunch. Their pulled pork sandwich is tender, and just the right amount of sweet. The potato sticks are a great add on! Great place, amazing vibe and attentive staff. A+"}
