{"text":"First time visiting this place and I must say that the food we ordered was very good!  The portions were very generous.  Too many Chinese food restaurants are closing in the Chandler area.  I hope this place is around for a while. Very kind staff and food was prepared quickly.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had a good meal with family here.  The food here was very affordable with good portion sizes.  We ordered Twice Cooked Pork (black bean sauce), Salt & Pepper Calamari, and Spicy Fish Fillet.  All the dishes were to our liking, and will likely dine again in the future.    Fair warning that this place is perhaps too authentic, so there may be a small language barrier.  All I can suggest is to review the menu and order by number / point at items on menu."}
{"text":"Convenient location and good food. Order ahead because it's made to order and they are a little slow."}
{"text":"They make the best chicken soup (Stew Country Chicken ????) and pork feet (Hunan Special Pig Feet ????) in town. I alway order these two dishes when I'm there."}
{"text":"I had been here years ago when it was under different management and had a different name so decided to finally try the new place. We walked in and right off the back the waitress let us know that food would be about 30 minutes and we decided to wait it out. I thought it was nice that she gave us a heads up on the time. I ordered chicken lo mein , my husband shrimp lo mein, my mom sweet & sour chicken, and we got extra orange chicken. Everything was delicious! The chicken lo mein was probably the best I've ever had it tasted clean and fresh, I will definitely be heading back for more soon. My husband and mom also loved their food and said they wanted to go back the next day! Oh also the place was clean and the waitress was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"My sons learning Chinese and we love to explore the food and try and order in the language.  We opted to give it a try.  Kind of wish we didn't.  I would give it a 2 due to lack of flavor however the food seemed fresh so I upgrade my review to a 3.  We ordered   1. chicken chow mein: it tasted okay and the meat was cooked nice but it was a little too greasy and tasteless for our liking.  We have a light serving and declined to take it with us.  It also came with a hot and sour type soup i think?  We each tried it and it was like a bowl of room temperature gelatin with an egg drop mixed with a few pieces of vegetables......not our thing.  2. Beef and broccoli lunch special: the broccoli was nice and the meat cooked well but definitely had a mystery flavor.    Also, The sauce was not our thing (maybe Its a Hunan thing) and we didn't eat more than two bites and set it aside.  The service was good but hard to communicate with the waitress and made for a difficult ordering.  Bottom line it was a very expensive trial."}
{"text":"Random stop at Hunan Garden. It was our first time there and saw the open sign on and said why not? So we decided to get a dinner plate to go. We were kindly greeted as soon as we walked in. And was offered suggestions from the hostess on menus items. We decided on the Kung pao chicken. Then added a hot sour soup seeing it was only an extra 6 bucks. The dinner plate was easily enough for 3 and the soup for 4. I was a little skeptical of the chicken in the Kung pao on first sight as from past experiences chicken that looked like it had an \"off taste\". If you know what I mean. But this chicken was great, no off taste. Great flavor good heat. Was a little warm in the dinning area, but it was 118 degrees today. And a little odd Simone prepping vegitables in the dining area. But overall..... Food was great. Portions large. Staff friendly. Just a little warm."}
{"text":"Not in love (yet).  But given it's proximity to my house, I'm gonna try real hard!"}
{"text":"This was the most authentic Chinese I've had in a very long while. Everything was so fresh and flavored exactly as it should be. We had fried rice that had veggies and eggs. It was so good. The portions were good."}
{"text":"While I miss Yangtze terribly, Hunan has been a pretty good for when I'm craving Kong Pao Chicken. I was in with my family yesterday for an early dinner and we were the only table there so I hope this place makes it. We had the KP Chicken, Pork Lo Mein and Hot & Sour soup which were all good. I've also had the Beef noodle soup and shredded pork with hot garlic which was also very good. The servers are very sweet but often forgetful and not very attentive. But the place is about 600 square feet so it's easy to flag them down or sadly raise your voice a bit and say \"excuse me!\"   I must say I do like the renovation they made after Yangtze closed. The place looks much nicer and is very clean, but the construction paper menu items around the kitchen window have to go. It cheapens the look."}
{"text":"Very good place to get real Chinese food, not those orange chicken American Chinese foods. 10/10 come again"}
{"text":"Tried the General \"Chow's\" chicken and was left very dissatisfied. No flavor, soggy chicken, and undercooked rice. Got through 4/5 bites before throwing away. Waste of $10"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim.  Felt like Chinese food, and this place was close.  Yelp seemed to indicate it would be pretty good.  Servers are Chinese and speak broken English. Just be aware going in that communication is a little tricky.  Service is not attentive. We got the Kung Pao and the garlic chicken.  Even with adding chili oil the kung pao was not spicy.  The garlic chicken is really more of a ginger chicken.  I was underwhelmed.  The flavors weren't bad, but they weren't really what they should have been either.  I've spent a lot of time in Asia and I know what those dishes should be like.  One positive is that they cook it fresh when you order it.  As soon as our order went in I could hear the sounds of stir frying in a wok.  It was done very quickly, and brought to the table.  We barely had time to finish the soup (which came with the lunch specials).  Very quick, very fresh.  So I'll bump them to three stars.  But the food was really only two stars.  I may or may not try them again sometime."}
{"text":"Lunch here was a rather \"fowl/foul\" experience.  Immediately on entering the restaurant there was a rather foul smell which was a little disconcerting. I chalked it up to perhaps some exotic dish being cooked up in the kitchen but later realized it was perhaps more a matter of lack of overall cleanliness. With limited time I decided on Kung Pao Chicken, a safe bet even in average Chinese restaurants.  Wrong again. Although the dish arrived steaming hot the overall taste was below average. The fowl (chicken) was tasteless and somewhat chewy. It's really hard not to be able to do Kung Pao right. So this was a big disappointment. Even the rice had a weird taste.  All in all an underwhelming experience.  The atmosphere was also not anything to write home about. Poorly lighted and depressing.  Today's restaurant choice was not one of my best moments especially since the true and tried Chou's Kitchen was only a mile and a half away."}
{"text":"Moving from the east coast, I had all but given up on finding good Chinese food in Arizona but this place nailed it. Quite possibly the best Chinese food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food. Love their menu with tons of photos. Lunch menu has good varieties and price is very reasonable. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Chiese resturant in the south east valley.  It serves great Chinese food with reasonable price."}
{"text":"Hunan Garden had its grand opening very recently. It used to be China Bistro, or some kind of Asian fusion restaurant. (Currently, there's a banner with the new name draped over the old sign. The waitress says a new sign should be up soon.)  My parents are from Hunan province, so we were looking forward to checking out this place. Their verdict: quite authentic. The cook is also from Hunan, and he came out to chat with my parents for a bit. He's very nice, as are the waitresses.   The menu consists partly of the \"usual\" dishes that you find at Chinese restaurants: orange chicken, kung pao chicken, etc. Then there are the Hunan dishes. Hunan food is known for being spicy, so if you like that and/or are feeling adventurous, go for the options marked with asterisks. We ordered the onion pancakes (makes a nice appetizer), sauteed green beans, twice-cooked pork, and beef with peppers. The pork and green beans were the best out of the four, in my opinion, but all four were very tasty.   The ambiance could use a little work, in particular the music (it was the radio, and included ads). Despite that, I think my family will definitely be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"I have liked everything I have ordered at this restaurant. My favorite is the saut√©ed green beans. The only thing I don't like is sometimes we go in during warmer weather and the temperature in the restaurant is too hot. It's as if they refuse to turn on the AC so that the customers can be comfortable.  I just don't go there when it's hot outside."}
{"text":"I was less than impressed after the new owners took over this restaurant.  While the Honey Walnut Prawns were very good, the rest was incredibly greasy.  The  Sweet and Sour Pork was less than appetizing and the fried rice was flavorless and had too much oil.  The Wor Won Ton soup is horrible.    Yangste Chinese Bistro will be missed.  Note to new owners...you should have never changed the phone number!  When we visited it was noon on a Friday and they had 1 table of guests.  I have never seen such a poor lunch turnout.  Good Luck~"}
{"text":"My family and I always come here because you get really great food for so cheap. I haven't been disappointed by a dish yet"}
{"text":"Yangste is truly missed. This  new place needs to produce way better food. It does not even compare to the bistro it once was. I'm very sad. The orange chicken used to be amazing, whole white meat chicken with a delicious battered crispy texture. Sad to say it doesn't even compare anymore. This place was a milestone in Chinese food here in chandler.... Now it is just a memory of how awesome it used to be."}
{"text":"Authentic Hunan Cuisine. Their seafood stir-fry with vegetables was amazing, not too spicy and seasoned just right.  I can't wait to try all their other dishes. It's a little place at the end of the mall, and a bit far for living out in Phoenix, but well worth the drive. Highly recommended."}
