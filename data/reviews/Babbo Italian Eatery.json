{"text":"I've been to Babbo's several times since it is so close to my house. My two favorites are the Pasta Martini and the Gorgonzola Salad. The bread is excellent, and I've had no issues with the wine, so maybe I've been lucky? I've also had their pizza, I can't recall which one, but it was excellent with peppers and goat cheese. The ambiance is great as well, and prices are very reasonable. The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the service has been sketchy at times. But, it isn't so bad that we won't return. Overall, a good place."}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided to try Babbo for lunch today based on reviews and friends recommendations.  The hostess was less than friendly when we asked about being seated at a booth.  The waitress was nice and took our order quickly. My daughter order a pasta dish and I ordered a pizza.  It took forever for our food.  My pizza was not even warm. I did not want to complain since my daughter treated me to lunch.  

I think Babbo has been the only upscale Italian eatery in the area for some time.  We recently visited Pomo Pizzaria down the street and it was soooooo much better.  I would not return based on the service, wait time and of course the food."}
{"text":"mediocre, nothing special, server was a kid who knew very little.  Food was bland, uninspired and it wasnt cheap. Probably targeted at the Rubes who come for the winter from the upper midwest.  Wont go back"}
{"text":"The service was outstanding. The food not so. My \"firecracker\" (wontons fried with fillings) were so overcooked they were hard and like rubber, the burn taste ruined the meal. Good service and great coffee but I will stick with Macaroni Grill."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night and we were quickly seated at a small table. The waiter was over with some hot bread topped with rosemary and some dipping oil promptly. The prices were decent around $10-$15 for most meals. We ordered a bottle of wine which was brought in a marble container that kept it cold throughout our meal. I ordered the chicken vegetable alfredo and my husband got the chicken parmesan. Mine was pretty good. They know how to make a good alfredo that doesn't separate.It could have had a bit more parmcheese to it or more flavor. The chicken really had no flavor and I thought would have been grilled. The vegetables were good except the shredded carrots on top were hard and dry. They softened up a bit once I stired them in the hot pasta. My husband's food was wonderful and I wish I ordered that after I had a couple bites. The marinara was great and the crispy chicken was tastey. There was plenty of food that I took half of mine home. Our waiter was fabulous and we will defiantly be back again when we want an Italian meal for a great prices."}
{"text":"Love most of the food but the service is horrible! We went for a very early dinner to use a friends and family coupon and it was apparently shift change because everyone was sitting around. We asked someone for a booster chair, she said let me get your server! The server came back and said oh we don't do boosters. That's a small indication of service, no plates, napkins, silverware until prompted. 

I do love the buffalo Caesar salad but don't bother getting the large because they  just add more lettuce. Kids love their pasta  but it doesn't even come with a drink (or she didn't offer) so $6 is steep IMO. 

We also tried the Firecrackers but be warned, you don't get Happy Hour pricing with any other offer. The steak firecrackers were very greasy, weird to be paired with marinara. 

Service is better at lunch but not by much, sticking with Nellos!"}
{"text":"So, I have to start my review by saying that I am a BIG fan of Babbo's and have been frequenting their restaurant in Surprise since they opened. However, since they changed locations, I have been disappointed multiple times, yet...i keep going back thinking this will get better! Nope, wrong! My husband and I went in a few months ago,  45 min wait, so we approached the bar. There were 3 seats open, we went to sit at 2 of them, and were told they were reserved???? I'm sorry, I thought bar seats were for patrons waiting for a table??? Manager tells us otherwise ...she must have been expecting friends??? Ok, so we like the food, so we now resolve to only order takeout. So....tonight  ( Thurs nite in July...not a busy nite) we order takeout at 6:02. Then receive an email that order will be ready in 20 min. Show up 20 min later only to wait for Another 45 min for my order. In the meantime, the poor girl who has to deal with all of the disgruntled takeout orders...because I am clearly not the only one...decides to be bitchy back to us. Never an \"I'm sorry for the wait...\" 
Good food, but awful service and management at this location...bigger isn't always better"}
{"text":"Horribly disappointed. I have never eaten at Babbo's before, but I had heard great things. For my husband and my anniversary I placed an online order for pickup the next day. Since I had never done it before, I decided to call and check if they had received the order. The woman I spoke with said she did not have the order, so I asked to place one over the phone. She took my order at 4pm for a 5:30pm pick up. My husband arrived at 5:40pm and was told that they didn't have any order placed for us. The host helping then found our order from the night before that no one bothered to place!!! They were not apologetic nor did they offer to make up for it. We were so hungry we got Subway instead. What a way to ruin an anniversary. I obviously can't speak for the food, but for customer service alone I will never try this place again."}
{"text":"Excellent food, my favorite Authentic Italian restaurant. The pasta dishes are all very very tasty and the spaghetti and meatballs are delicious and seasoned to perfection, not to mention the unlimited amount of bread you get before and with your meal. Give it a try and you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had a great experience on both occasions. The bread is incredible and they keep it coming... so COME HUNGRY. The pasta is great and I always have enough for leftovers. The servers are very energetic and will give you their honest opinions about what to order. 

We usually have about a 20 min. wait to be seated."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Dine in or take out!  The bread is such a great perk!  I think the pizza and salad combo is perfect.  Nice clean environment and the staff is always pleasant.  Would recommend to anyone who is in the Surprise area to stop for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times (old location and new one) and have always had good service,  and the food is great. But tonight we had a waiter named Mark who was terrible!  The table next to us was seated after us and had their drinks and bread before our waiter even came by. Then we never received the salad we ordered. Needless to say his tip was not the best!"}
{"text":"Great place for Italian.  The bread is fresh and delicious.  Try the spicy alfredo with sausage.  It can't be beat."}
{"text":"They upgraded the inside very nicely (a year or so ago) and it's modern and cute.

The food is ok ...not the best. I ordered the steak and blue salad (supposed to have steak and blue cheese in it as the name suggests) they forgot the blue cheese. humm?

Their wine is not worth it.  The bread is ok but every time i've been there - it took a loooong time for it to make it to the table.

The Pasta is so/so.  The Pasta Martini is inconsistent - sometimes the sauce is too alfredo-ish and it's icky.  Can't really go wrong with the Italian Sausage Pasta and i like the Pasta Rustico (add the chicken to it! )  - but they are just typical fare. 

Sandwiches are pretty tasty.  

I'm giving it a 3start rating because it's good but never sticks out in my mind that I want to go there again."}
{"text":"Have dined at Babbo's several times and generally had good food and experiences.  Last time was NOT SO GOOD as i developed food poisoning later that night and one of the worst experiences i had.  Decided to share with the manager 3 days later AND again had a poor experience.  My intent was to share AND let her know there was a problem BUT it felt like I was bothering her.  Too bad as we like going but no longer feel comfortable with management and desire to take care of customers...."}
{"text":"First time eating here, and the last. I must say the staff is friendly. They seem misguided though. The host asked if we wanted a table or booth. We said booth. His reply was let me go wipe one down for you.
So he did and that was great.  Once we were seated I noticed that more people coming in the door were given the same response when wanting a booth. Why wouldnt you just send someone to clean all the empty tables? I saw plenty of people working and the booth we sat at I could see an employee wrapping silverwear the whole time we were there. Then I noticed there was a lot of crumbs all over the floor in multiple spots. Kinda gross. Well I ordered the buffalo chicken Caesar salad. My fiance ordered some italian sausage mac and cheese. Plus a glass of wine. My salad came out and was not very large and the presentation was boring. Ive had better salads at fast food joints. The mac and cheese again was small and tasted really greasy. Our bill was 40 dollars. What a joke. I should have gone somewhere else for that kind of food. Not worth the money. Dirty, expensive and the food was not great at all."}
{"text":"Great food as usual, but the wait time to get the food after we ordered was ridiculous. It was easily a 35-40 minute wait, if not more. The wait time has been progressively getting worst since I started coming here last year. If I decide to come back I'll probably just do take out."}
{"text":"It's hard to see a what used to be a good restaurant to come to, turn into what it is now. Dirty bar, trash piled up, no one cleaning the area after customer leave. Staff that won't check in on customers. It's very unfortunate.  Used to love the service years ago. Never will return."}
{"text":"Food is good and they give you a lot. The only issue is since this is like one of the only restaurants in surprise it's always busy"}
{"text":"While I'd like to give it more stars, I just can't for two reasons:  The food was delish but not memorable and it's a chain.

Upon entering we noticed the atmosphere was a little mixed.  Meaning the decor is a little cold, but the employees were very warm and inviting.  We decided to sit at the bar.  We started out with the Firecracker rolls.  Interesting and not bad.  A little on the bland side.  We split one of the Neapolitan pizzas, which was also not bad.  The service was friendly.  This location (16th St.) seems to have quite a few regulars as they were popping in and out throughout our stay.  

If we are in the neighborhood we might try it again, but there are so many good restaurants in that hood..."}
{"text":"Went here with my mom. The Italian sodas are amazing here. My mom got a fettuccine pasta with veggies she loved it. I got plain spaghetti and sent it back. We usually have a good experience here however the last few times was less than stellar."}
{"text":"I love this place! The pastas and pesto bruschetta are amazing and best martinis I've had in a very long time! I would highly recommend it to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Pleasant decor.  Lots of booths.  Excellent service.  They have good lunch specials.  We have been here twice.  I can recommend the pizza and salads.  The crust on the pizza was excellent and it was very flavorful.  We will definitely return as it is one of the better places to eat in this part of town."}
{"text":"We went to Babbo on valentines day. There was just one more table occupied beside ours. I ordered Cacciatore Style Chicken pasta. The chicken was overcooked and the pasta was pretty much tasteless. We let the server know and he took forever to come back. Instead a girl came and spoke to us with such an attitude. We have decided not to go to this place ever again. The food was disappointing but the bigger disappointment was their attitude. Our server was not that bad but he was extremely slow even though there was just one more table occupied. But we are never coming back again to this place!"}
{"text":"I am a self proclaimed Italian food snob and am always hesitant about trying new places.  I was there with a group of friends who ordered the Toasted Ravioli appetizer, which were placed on a ladle full of their bolognese sauce. First thing I did was get a spoonful of the sauce. I am pleased to announce that it got my approval. As for my meal, I had the sauteed white bean and arugula salad with shrimp....yummy!"}
{"text":"Great food! Service was not that good. Wished we had the server the people next to us had. Their server gave them suggestions, specials and answered all their questions. We barely got a drink refill.  Next time we will make sure we get a different server. Definitely recommend you try this place :-)"}
{"text":"The meatballs are the BEST I've ever had! Since we've only gone to Babbo's twice for their $5.99 spaghetti and meatballs (Mon & Tues), I can't comment on anything else except the bread and salads and they were also delicious. I want their meatball recipe!  The staff is young and they all seemed to make a great effort to make sure we were happy. All five of us agreed we must try other dishes next time."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, one of these times was too long ago to really remember.  This time I ordered the Pasta Valducci, which was a pasta in pink sauce with artichokes, sun dried tomatoes and kalamata olives.  It has great flavor, I'd recommend it to anyone wanting more than thee common spaghetti or fettuccine alfredo, this dish has a lot more to offer. Especially when you're looking for a meatless meal, meatless doesn't have to be boring.

They also have great bread, fresh out of the oven and really soft.."}
{"text":"I love Babbo's. The first time we ate here was about 10 years ago when we first moved here and it was so-so. Well, thankfully we gave it another try a few weeks ago and it has become our 'go-to' for Italian food.

I was craving meatballs in sauce and didn't have time to make it. (I'm Italian and always make my Italian food from scratch.) So we ordered spaghetti and meatballs to go on our way home. In my mind there are 2 dishes you should rate an Italian restaurant on -- meatballs and sauce. If those 2 are good, they can probably handle everything else. And Babbo knows both!

Since then we've ordered 'to go' and had eat in. Their salads are delicious, especially the roasted brussel sprout, beet salad. I'm addicted to it. I also love their free focaccia, although it could use more toasting. There is also a wide array of pastas and a happy hour that I'm looking forward to trying. If you haven't gone to Babbo in a while, please give it another try!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite on a Tuesday night. They have a $5.99 special on Tuesdays for spaghetti and meatballs. I was so happy with my order! 3 of us all got the special and the food came out fast and tasted great. The meatballs were about the size of baseballs and I could barely finish mine! The atmosphere was awesome and I really liked my server. Overall it was a great experience and I will definitely be returning to order the special again, as well as tot try out other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"We happened to drop by Babbo's after researching restaurants  in Cave Creek on yelp Lo and behold it was Monday night. How lucky is that?
The spaghetti and meatball dinner special is served on Monday & Tues night & was REALLLLY good !!
Very decent size plate of tasty (not sour) tomato sauce, pasta done just right  and 2 huge meatballs for $5.99.
Served with hot pizza dough bread slices and dipping basmati vinegar and olive oil.
Very crowded and a favorite with the local crowd we heard.
This was too good to be true and too much for us to eat so we ended up with takeout boxes."}
{"text":"Hostess on New Years Eve was incredibly rude.  Our reservation was for 5:00, it's not like they were busy that early, food took forever to arrive.  Dessert took 15mn to arrive.  Then the hostess comes over as we are paying the check and tells us the next reservation is waiting for our table.  How is that my concern when it took so long to be served?  Trying to enjoy a holiday meal and they were pushing us out the door.  Food was decent, but not worth the attitude we got from the hostess."}
{"text":"People are so nice at this location. Very friendly and accommodating. I love the bread here. Food - very mediocre but at least you know what you get."}
{"text":"So yum! Went here with some girlfriends the other night. I got a four cheese past and a glass of wine. Cutest server John!!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place! We are never disappointed. They can make the pastas and kids mac n cheese with gluten free noodles. The biggest 'problem' is deciding what im in the mood for."}
{"text":"This is a Fabulous Italian Place hidden in a strip mall! The small bistro has a cute and easy going setting with a very nice and friendly staff. I am a big fan of Italian food and this did not disappoint. The Spaghetti and meatballs ruled as well as the bread and oil they serve. So forget all the chain restaurants smothering the Arizona land and try Babbo. I cant wait to go back to try more off their menu."}
{"text":"Babbos is a great restaurant.  It is one of our favorites, and we usually go a couple times a month.  Their food is delicious, made of fresh ingredients....and the service is fantastic.  Their bread they serve when you first arrive...is the best I've ever tried."}
{"text":"A group of my friends went here to celebrate two birthdays, one of which was mine.  The service was very good.  The food was really good.  And to top off the amazing meal we had our choice of birthday desserts...seriously?  Very generous and delicious."}
{"text":"Must try the grown up Mac and Cheese!  Service has always been good, and food comes fast.  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We have been long time Babbo customers. Last evening, when in a different part of town we tried this location and left very disappointed. It was not a very busy night yet when we asked for plates when the bread was served, we didn't receive them until 15 minutes later, after we ate our bread. We also waited over 45 minutes for our meal and watched a table of 4 that came in 20 minutes after we did receive their food first. When we asked our waiter he said they got busy with to go orders. No apology and no offer to check on our order. When I finally asked the manager Logan about it he came back with our food. Literally placed it down and turned and walked away. No sorry for the wait, etc. After that no one check in on us. This place needs to bone up on their customer service skills. We are in the neighborhood often and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious food and wonderful service! Best bread I've ever had in my life!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! The wait staff has always been friendly and fast. Prices are good and I have never ordered something I didn't like. Great pastas and salads and excellent desserts. It has a good atmosphere and the wait has never been too long. I definitely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Came to dinner for our anniversary and enjoyed a pizza and two pasta dishes. The pizza was crazy good but on the small side (wouldn't have been enough to fill either of us up as an entree on its own). The pasta was drowned in sauce, but at least the sauce was tasty. Served bread as a starter that was very good. Will definitely come back for another try soon. Service was just OK."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  Our kids love the Italian sodas and the prices are very reasonable with good-sized portions.  Service is great as well.  Their pasta dish with vodka sauce is wonderful."}
{"text":"food is great. but service was rushed. not why we became regulars a long time ago. miss you Shanna!"}
{"text":"Let me explain why I'm giving it four stars.
The bread! Oh MY stars! the free bread is amazing! it's super soft and flavorful and every time I go to an Italian restaurant I sorely miss Babbo's bread!
And the gargonzola salad is to die for. Whenever I go, I eat a TON of bread and order this salad. The salads are always super fresh and this particular salad is amazing!
Just for these two things, I give it 5 stars.
Unfortunately, I've had other items on the menu that I don't care for so I stick to this specific order:)
As for the service-- I've had good and bad but mostly great service! I also discovered that after a hard day at work, I can call in my special request and take it to go:)"}
{"text":"Love this place, great food, great service.

The spaghetti and meatballs is my steady go to.

Everything else I have sampled off my wife's place has been delicious.

Also prompt and good service."}
{"text":"Been dining here for 3-4 years and we continue to enjoy the food.  Bread is hot and fresh, servers are friendly, portions are good size and all at a decent price.

Menu was recently revised which was great to see, but still no lasagna?  Regardless, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Wife and I order the garlic hummus on Tuesday evening for dinner and it never arrives- waiter forgot to put the order in. Return the next day for lunch and they are \"out\". Is this not something made in house? Place going downhill fast since GM Logan left."}
{"text":"I miss this place, someday when I leave NY and move back I hope you are still there. Great Food !"}
{"text":"Had to wait a little before being seated but had a great menu selection and very good food.  Only issue was they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss.  The first time we went on New Year's Eve when it was extremely busy.  They had run out of bread, and were making some other type of bread sticks, which were still fairly tasty.  We also ordered the Bruschetta Romano and they brought out toasted baguettes with a side of marinara sauce.  Then when asked about it, the waiter tried to act like he didn't know, but then came back and apologized that it wasn't correct.  I had the Supremo Alfredo which was good, my husband didn't care for his entree too much.  They did have a nice bar selection of beer, wine and well drinks.  We have since been back several times both for take-out and dine-in.  I think it is over-priced for what you get.  I would expect nicer napkins and tables for the price range.  It is more like a cafe type setting, with nicer resaurant prices. Their pizza isn't bad.  We often times will get take-out for pizza.  The last time my husband went to place an order for take-out, there were a lot of people in the front area waiting for seats.  One customer had a child laying on the take-out counter which totally is unacceptable.  This is where food is being placed for pick-up?  My husband waited for a few minutes and when no one acknowledged his presence or asked the man and his child to move off of the counter, my husband decided we would do Fire House Subs instead.  
Will we try it again?  Probably... it may be awhile though.  Maybe I will chalk it up to them being a new business and needing to get the kinks worked out."}
{"text":"This place is a great and very inexpensive place to eat. I highly recommend Amy's lasagna. They also have peroni (Italian beer) on tap and it is ice cold! The tourists hit this place hard during fall/winter/spring, so plan on a wait! The bar is self-seating."}
{"text":"Monday and tuesday they have a 5.99 special spagetti and meatballs dinner.  It was fantastic the bread was great.  Well worth the price.  Ambience was upscale but very comfortable.  Had the apple calzone for desert.  One fed all four of us, it was fantastic."}
{"text":"The food here is indescribably amazing. They bring bread to your table that is absolutely RIDONKULOUS, I could eat it all day. My sandwich was really delicious as well. I don't live in Tempe but Babbo's will definitely be one of my stops anytime I'm in town. The only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service was only okay. I wasn't stunned by how fabulous our waitress was, at all. Plus she only came to the table twice, once to greet us & say she'll \"be right back\", and then once to bring us the check. Another man offered us drinks, took our order, and brought us our food. So I'm not entirely sure why she was even there. 
Overall, this place is grade A. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"consistently yummy!!! I frequent Babbo quite often..quick lunch with the hubs...take out for dinner, dinner with my ladies. Everything is always good. Bread and oil check...pasta check...MR Pibb check!! I like their special deals on monday and tuesday for spaghetti and meatballs for $6 cant go wrong!"}
{"text":"The pizza and calzones are great, the service is solid, the atmosphere is hip, the selection at the bar is great, and the price is right. I'm dying for a calzone right now (they're my favorite, hands down) but they've got a great selection of salads as well."}
{"text":"We're kind of tight on our budget this month but yet we  wanted to go out and have a nice high quality meal Tuesday nights half price spaghetti dinner for two Plus wine appetizers came out to be less than $30 what a deal great place great service wonderful location had dinner outside on the patio area beautiful evening who could ask for more I would highly recommend this great place"}
{"text":"We love this place! Quaint, clean, good food and great wine selection by the glass...must have the fried ravioli!"}
{"text":"So let me start out by saying that this placed is always packed on Monday or Tuesday's for their 5.99 spaghetti meatball special. Which is a pretty good deal for the price point. 

On Saturday night I went in with a few friends of mine for a birthday dinner and we were waited on by a really nice girl who recommended some great wine and apps. After a few minutes a manager came over and poured the wine at our table and was super friendly. We all ordered our food after a few drinks I got the chipotle chicken pasta which was to die for! My friends shared a pizza which looked really good. I had mentioned it was my friends birthday and the sever brought of a menu and said we should pick out a dessert. We all decided on getting the pizza cookie which was good just wish you got some more ice cream there was three scoops and four girls so we had to share. 

Over all great experience for our first time in there not on a Monday. The only draw back was the music was pretty strange for an Italian place. Pretty sure at some point we were listening to a Spanish guitar love song lol! We will be going back again. For the good food and price point you can't beat this place when your looking to go out and don't wanna drive into town."}
{"text":"i was at a conference last week at the pointe squaw peak and we saw this cute little eatery & decided to give it a try! I was very pleased!! i went there with some colleagues and we all ordered different things - the service was great, very quick & the server was on top of things! (funny too!!) i ordered the lunch special - salad & pasta - the salad was crisp & fresh with golden raisins and a great dressing. the pasta was perfectly al dente with a pink sauce & sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts & olives....
my co-workers were pleased also - the pasta rustico was filling and loaded with chicken, the meatball subs were just the right size on great bread with lots o meat & the caprese salad is served with pistachios!! yum!!
babbo is well priced (lunch specials are $9) and a quick bite of good (if fairly traditional) pseudo-italian eats! cant wait to go again :)"}
{"text":"Babbo's is fast becoming a fave stop for me and my husband especially on Monday and Tuesday when they have their $5.99 spaghetti special!  It is a smaller venue but we usually get there early enough that it is not an issue. Still working our way through the menu but so far everything has been great. They make their own pasta on site and you can def tell the quality. The spaghetti has a bit of heat to it which is a nice change and there are almost always leftovers for lunch the next day! Service hads always been prompt and friendly and overall its just a nice, comfortable joint to go and relax and know you are gonna get some great food consistently. What else can you really ask for?"}
{"text":"My Wife and I, who are new to town, visited Babbo last week. We both love Italian food eateries and Babbo did not disappoint. 
We went for an early dinner at 4pm and had to wait 15min to be seated, the place was packed at 4 in the afternoon, great sign of goodness to come.
The complimentary warm bread and olive oil was fresh and tasty, excellent.
I had the Margherita Pizza and my Wife had the Spagetti and Meatballs. I always order the Margherita the first time I go to a new Italian joint, to me that will tell me all I need to know about the place far as how serious they take themselves as being authentic Italian food. It was SO good, fresh crust, the roma tomatoes were garden fresh and exploded with flavor. Nothing is better when you take a bite of a great margherita pizza and you taste the cheese and tomoatoes and smell the fresh basil. Its a great combination of goodness.
The spagetti and meatballs were just as good as the pizza. Its another Italian staple that to many new diners try to \"modernize\" and just mess it up. Fresh noodles, sauce and meatballs. Just put them together and let them do their job, it was very tasty.
As much as we enjoyed our entrees the star of the evening was the Italian Sodas. Yes, this place is serious. We had the Verry-Chanilla and Dreamsicle.  Both were so cold and refreshing and bursting with flavors. Perfect for a 109 degree summer afternoon.
The hostest was very polite and friendly and as were our waiter. Great customer service.
For this visit I give 4 stars, but only becuase I plan on returning and Im sure I will be just as satisfied the next time and will have a 5 star dining experience."}
{"text":"Food was great! The raspberry whirl drink is my favorite!Our sever Juan was very good we were in a rush and he moved quick so we could make it in time!Love this place, I go here every so often and it is pretty consistent with the quality with a slips here and there. I recommend the spring mix salad and the chicken alfredo."}
{"text":"We have passed Babbo's many times and always thought it looked fancy and therefore expensive,  wow were we wrong.  The process ate extremely reasonable. 
They start out with Italian bread and olive oil,  they gave the kids some garlic butter which was awesome and we had the garlic spread,  fantastic. 
Kids had mac and cheese which was gone double quick,  garlic chicken penne was fantastic and the spaghetti and meatballs far exceeded or expectations.  My wife likes Olive Garden. .....We will never go back there after experiencing Babbo's.
I HIGHLY recommend this place,  service is fantastic,  very friendly,  portion size is just right."}
{"text":"We have visited both the location in Surprise and the location in Arrowhead on several occassions and have never been disappointed. As others have mentioned, the complimentary bread and dipping oil is wonderful. I could make a meal of that alone with a bottle of wine. ;-) 

Some of the things we have had....Bruschetta Romana = good, Firecracker Rolls = husband likes, not my favorite, Roasted Brussels Sprout Beet Salad = LOVE, Calzone = Husband loves, Kid's calzone = son orders every time, Italiano Sandwich and Buffalo Chicken Ceasar Sandwich = my adult daughters love. 

My personal favorite meal would be the bread followed by the Roasted Brussels Sprout Beet Salad and The Amalfi Thin & Crusty pizza served with a nice bottle of red wine. I have had some of their pasta dishes as well and they were all very good.

I have never tried their spaghetti and meatballs. I make those at home and can't see paying someone else to make them for me. :)

The Italian Sodas are a hit with the kids!"}
{"text":"Takes a little while to get the food out, but I love this place. Great service, friendly staff. Every tuesday and monday I belive they do $6 Spaghetti!"}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner last night, my husband & I had looked at menu on line before we went.  When we got there, one of the dishes he saw on the on
line menu was no longer available so he just picked another dish.  This nice professional young man Nick came over to our table.  First thing he did was introduce himself as our server and welcomed us in to the restaurant .  My husband asked him about the dish he saw online (penne with pesto, flank steak, mushrooms & sun dried tomatoes). Nick explained it was no longer on menu \"but we can definitely make it for you\"!  I ordered a personal size pizza.  The food was really good, but all my Husband and I were talking about was Nick.  He's a young Man who was so professional and personable.  He knew the food menu very well, and the wine list as well. It was so refreshing to have a young server go above & beyond to make our night out memorable.  Thank you Nick!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy coming here 1-2 times a week.  Great selection of personal style pizza's and great pasta recipe's that seem to be very original and fresh.  Chipotle chicken pasta is a personal favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"Very good Italian-American place in Surprise.  The bread is addicting- I cannot say enough about how delicious it is.  Warm, freshly baked, covered in herbs and dipped in fairly good quality olive oil and vinegar.  If you feel thrifty, you can easily get away spending less than $15 for 2 people by splitting a pasta or pizza entree (all big enough to split) and stuffing yourself on the bread which just keeps coming.  

Their menu has a lot of options, though, so I like to enjoy variety.  The Pasta Rustica is a favorite- with ricotta cheese and spinach.  The pizzas are also very good- much better than I expected.  On Mondays (and Tuesdays, I think) they have a special of their normal-sized spaghetti and meatballs for $5.99.  A fantastic deal because you can easily eat half (comes with 2 big meatballs that are actually very good, and I am extremely picky about meatballs since I'm Italian) and save the other half for lunch the next day.  

They have a great martini list, too, though I rarely splurge on buying alcohol (I'm one of those who doesn't understand paying enough to buy a bottle of liquor just because I'm in a restaurant).  They do have happy hour specials, though, which are only available at the bar.

We have never made it out of there with enough room to try dessert, though they all look delicious.  Overall, a great place for a casual night out."}
{"text":"Well...I'm at the new location today and so far not impressed with the hostess staff, what a stuck up snotty girl, we had seat us. Her attitude really came when I had to walk up to the bar to see if we seated ourselves or do we wait?  Our server Jacob was very pleasant. Overall the food was \"okay\" The service (kitchen staff) was slow, and not one sever that passed by the table had a smile to share. Makes me wonder what happened from the small location they moved from to their newly built one to make them not as friendly as before.  Here's to hoping they bring back their once friendly attitude and customer appreciation."}
{"text":"First time here and quite impressed with the family type service from Matt! The '3 cheese mac n cheese' was Matt's recommendation and he was spot on!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. John was attentive and friendly. Had the Cajun Jambalaya and then Tiramisu for dessert. Both awesome. Both my daughters had a calzone and a dessert each, plain cheesecake and chocolate torte. They really loved the food, they don't normally order dessert. Of course we all brought our food home, we thought we could eat it all. My husband was the only one who finished his calzone."}
{"text":"What a great local place with awesome food! By far the best in the local area."}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to Babbo's for date night. Our bill averages out to $25-30 dollars. The decor is warm and romantic, and the food is delicious! I haven't tried anything there that I didn't like. My favorite is the Tuscan turkey sandwich. We tend to eat out at 4:50, so we haven't experienced the server problems that other people have at this location."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, each and every time. I have been the other Babbo locations and have always received great service and food. The server comes around quickly to take your drink and food order. The food comes out piping hot and quick. This place is really close to my work, being able to come in and out within the hour for lunch is really important to me. Each and every time I go for lunch I was always able to get out quick. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Still waiting on their gift card hahaha this company is such a joke omg I wasn't going back I was just thinking I'd give it to Someone but still hasn't come went to the extent of asking for my address obviously. So funny"}
{"text":"The prices are good and so is the food. We always get the Pesto Bruchetta for the appetizer. Their recipes all use very creative ingredients. My favorite dish is the Napa Valley Salad, but the Chicken Limone is pretty good as well. I'm glad they are starting to expand into other areas of the valley as I am tired of seeing the same old chain Italian places on every corner."}
{"text":"Eh not sure I would go again came for lunch with my Friends and we ordered some food obv. Took a long time and plus there was meat in our food when we said we don't eat meat."}
{"text":"In the words of Randy Jackson, \"it was just ai'ight for me, dawg.\" 

I placed an order which I had placed online for pickup. The website said that it would be 20 minutes. I got there 23 minutes later and the food was ready for me, awesome, no waiting. I opened the bag and there were no napkins or utensils, which is fine because i just took it home to eat. Had I taken to work or somewhere else, I would have been pretty much SOL. The bread was piping hot and fresh. They included olive oil and balsamic vinegar, but the vinegar to oil ratio was poor. The amount of vinegar was probably 1/20th the amount of oil. So basically i was left dipping already oiled focaccia into more oil. Not cool. I had to pour out most of the oil and add my own balsamic to get the proportion correct. The bread itself was good though. 

I ordered the Jambalaya pasta which came with chicken and spicy sausage on fettucine. The pasta had a lot of flavor, but was really really greasy. By the end of the meal I had an entire layer of orange oil at the bottom of the plate. There wasn't that much sausage in the meal so it couldn't have all come from the sausage. My guess was that they went a little overboard on the oil when they made the sauce. 

I think that I will definitely give this place another chance and dine-in. I want to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Must be standard answer to bad service experience!  Send us your email address and we will get back to you. Never heard a thing!"}
{"text":"Absolutely hands-down one of the best Italian restaurant in Surprise Az Service is absolutely phenomenal even down to the manager Noel who was very attentive to us. We will definitely be visiting again"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I were looking for a quick, in and out, italian place to grab a late lunch.  Could not have been more pleased to stumble upon Babbo's.  I read some other comments saying they just opened up, but from the way it's run, I could never tell.  We got in around 3:40 and I was delighted to find out about their Happy Hour (3:30-6:00).  We ordered an assortment of wine which was surprisingly delicious.  I'm not a big wine guy but my boss is and he was freaking out about it and ended up grabbing a bottle to take home.  What made it even better was that a glass of wine is super cheap during Happy Hour.  We told our server, a knowledgeable tall gentleman, that we needed to be in and out and he assured us our food would be out ASAP.  I ordered the Alfredo Supremo With Chicken which was relatively inexpensive, filled me up, and I was able to box half of it up for the wife to enjoy later.  The waiter came back with separate checks promptly after we finished our meals as if he knew we were going to ask.  After a great dining experience, we were in and out in less than 30 minutes.  This is my new italian get away!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Came in on a Saturday night & there was no wait. I guess that should have been our first clue we were in for disappointment. They sat us right away. Our waitress came right away to take our drink order, but didn't come back with our cokes for more than 15 minutes. People came in after us & got their drinks & bread way before us.

I ordered the lasagna & the menu states it is worth the wait, the waitress told me 30 minutes. I was ok waiting, BUT my thirty minutes turned into over an hour! 4 different tables came in after us, ordered, got their food & left long before our food came.

After an hour & 20 minutes, our food FINALLY arrived. What a HUGE disappointment. The lasagna marinara tasted like it was straight tomato sauce out of a can with no seasonings. I was telling my family how it was not worth the wait not realizing our waitress was behind me. She asked me if I didn't like it & I told her no & that it wasn't worth waiting over an hour for. All she could say is \"is it hot?\" No apology for the wait, never asked if I wanted something else. 

My husband got some type of Alfredo & paid extra to have shrimp added. I think the shrimp had been boiled & had no flavor. 

We will not be back & too bad because it is fairly close to where we live. Maybe only if we want bread because that was the ONLY good part to our meal."}
{"text":"We go on Monday or Tuesday nights for their spaghetti dinner deal--spaghetti and meatballs for $5.99! It's a GREAT deal (and I do love me a deal), and it's very tasty. I'm picky about spaghetti/meatballs, and these are legit. The meatballs aren't greasy or a strange meat concoction...they are full of flavor with a slight char/browning to them. Delicious! The sauce is great and I wish I could recreate it. But for $5.99 a plate I'd rather they do it!
You get free bread which is ok--depends on the day. Some days it's really good and sometimes it's a bit on the dry side. No matter-just dip it in some olive oil and balsamic. 
I ordered a side salad the first time I went here and what a rip off. $3 something for some greens piled on a bread plate sized dish. Meh. But the main event is the spag and meatballs. GO!"}
{"text":"So yummy and good service! We went on New Year's Eve for dinner. Made a reservation, thinking it would be crowded, but we were pleasantly surprised to see we didn't need one. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We've been to Babbo's twice.  We liked it the first time and liked it even better the second time.  Luckily, we had the same waiter, Dean, both times.  First time we had pasta dinners that were great and the second  time we sat outside and had happy hour items - Dean took the time to answer all our questions about what the appetizers were - we had Firecracker Rolls and Stuffed Portobello mushrooms- both appetizers were fantastic.  To us, service is a big deal, and that was one of the best things about Babbo's - we will be back with  friends and will definitely ask for Dean to be our server!  Great to have a place like this place in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Best Salad Ever...love the shrimp & cannellini bean salad with arugula. It's a heart healthy treat that's hard to beat. Also enjoy their pizzas and homemade meatballs. They had me at hello. I love this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by Babbo for a late dinner tonight (arrived at 7:40) and our order (pasta and a salad) was taken.  We questioned the waiter after 40 minutes of waiting for our food and he was surprised that we had not been served. He checked the kitchen and found that our order had not been pulled by the kitchen staff.  There were about three other occupied tables in the entire restaurant at the time.  We decided to leave but asked to see his manager first.  She apologized but did nothing to try to make the situation better.  Probably the worst experience we've ever had with wait staff and a  manager at a restaurant.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Partner and I went for dinner over the weekend. This was my first time eating here. There was a short wait so we took a seat at the bar and ordered a drink. The bartender was very outgoing and helpful. After seated, we were served bread and olive oil with balsamic. Partner ordered lasagna and I ordered roasted Brussel sprouts, prosciutto and  Parmesan cheese in a garlic butter over fettuccini. Both dishes were outstanding and the portions were so large, we had the remainder the following day for lunch. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Even though it was my first time in, it is my new favorite restaurant! I can't wait to go back in and try more. They had so much to offer and a lot of dishes you wouldn't expect to see on a ordinary italian restaurants menu. Not to mention the service was great and the inside is beautiful (even the bathrooms! There's a chandelier in the family bath!) The prices were fair and we loved the happy hour! 

I came in the other day at about 5:30 and was seated right away. My server not only let me know that it was happy hour but also made great suggestions on what to get. My husband tried their draft beer and I ordered myself a margarita. I was so shocked to see that they had premium liquor and it was included in the happy hour. Most places only give you their well but they had almost all of their drinks with the premium liquor on happy hour! Our server even brought us over waters without us asking.

We got the roasted asparagus as an appetizer which was recommended by our server. It was so good the way they cooked it! I don't usually like asparagus but it was so good! It even came with a side salad of some sort which was great as well. 

It was about time for us to order our food and our server had again made more recommendations for us. She really knew what she was talking about and made the big menu not as scary to choose something. She even saw that our drinks were getting low and asked us if we wanted another round before happy hour ended. 

Our food came in a prompt manner and was steaming hot when it arrived. I tried the garlic shrimp and my husband had a calzone. Man was that thing huge! It was about the size of a football! Both dishes were really good and the bread that came with it was so addicting! My husband tried to finish his calzone but didn't quite. I was shocked to see that our lovely server brought over not only a container for the calzone but even a little one for his marinara. 

She offered us the after dinner menu and we took a look but we were stuffed. It looked like a good variety of \"family style\" and smaller portioned desserts for two. 

I highly recommend trying the place out if you live near or are in the area!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. We had Austin and he was more then amazing! He has such a good attitude and was always right there when we needed something. Our food did not take long at all and it was delicious. It had a good atmosphere and wasn't loud at all. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Really good fine (as I like it) spaghetti and decent sized meatballs.  Filling.
Loved the focaccio and oil with balsamic vinegar best.  
Tuesday night special is $5.99 and that's reasonable.  
Drinks not cheap.  Coke is $2.75
They're a little sparing with the napkins but an upmarket (for E. Mesa) date-night venue."}
{"text":"Absolutely crap!!! I dont understand how a place can be so busy but have such terrible food and selection. My daughter wanted Lasagna but nope! Not on the menu. My food was cold and lacked flavor, my wife had a piece of hair in hers...the wine was good and the bread was ok. But there are way better Italian restaurants out there...try it out but I am not impressed. I would rather eat at Carrabbas. Never again!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I LOVE the food at Babbo. I live down the street and have ordered take out many times and my boyfriend has picked it up. Today is the first time I have ever dined in. I am with my mother who is in from out of town and I raved about this place to her. 
   Walk in, hostess gives us a hi! I say \"four\" four with the baby or without the baby? Without. She says \"ok let me ask.\" Ask what? Are babies not allowed? She came back and said \"right this way.\" But then quickly turned around and said \"wait let me check on it\" ok. No prob. We are seated and we wait. And wait. And wait some more. 5-6 employed walk past us and not one acknowledges our presence. I was a server for 14 years and when people don't have the  courtesy to say hello it really irritates me. After about 10 mins I make eye contact with whom I assume is a busser and I hear him go near the pos and say \"you have a table. They've been here for a while\"
 Server brings over oil and asks for drink order. Says bread will be right out. 15 mins later bread comes out. Before the bread came out both of our appetizers did. The tomatoes on the stuffed portabella were literally ice cold. The rest of our food came out on time, but was pretty disappointing. My Brussels sprouts pizza had about 5 split sprouts. The chipotle pasta had no sick and the sauce was extremely runny. All in all I am so disappointed in Babbo and wish I would have chosen a different restaurant to bring out of town guests. I probably will not return. There seems to be no management at all...


****update***** 
As you can see, Babbo contacted me and we exchanged emails. They said they would send a gift card since we had such a bad experience and then never did. So now I have even worse feelings towards them and probably won't even order carry out from there anymore. Horrible business practice"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my fiance and we had a really pleasant time,  the staff was amazing and really nice. 
The food was excellent,  we'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Ordered a very spicy shrimp and Italian sausage dish, which I did not care for.  The waitress switched my order with no hassle!  Truly fantastic food and sercvice!!!!"}
{"text":"The bread was terrible. The pasta tasted like tomato soup. It should not be listed as an Italian restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great pasta and their salads are to die for.  Never had a salad here that wasn't wonderful.  Have my faves for pasta; asparagus mushroom the best in my opinion.  Spaghetti specials have great meatballs but I've had better sauce; not to worry, many other wonderful pastas available."}
{"text":"They are gluten free and serious about it.  Great food, friendly service, well trained staff.  I have recommended them to many friends."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Staff was friendly and attentive. Great place for some quick Italian eats. Pasta is always very hot and their marinara sauce has a nice acidic flavor which I like. I would recommend the classic spaghetti and meatballs. The portions sizes are reasonable but not huge. For pasta it's a great pick. Pizza's are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"We come here quite a bit and really wanted to let everyone know how much we love this place! Food is amazing, made to order. The creativity of the kitchen is awesome. The servers are extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their product. Alex is definitely our favorite, I believe he manages sometimes as well. His attitude makes it such a fun place to be. You can tell he really enjoys his job...  Anyway, babbos is great"}
{"text":"Yum.  Have never had a bad meal and they have a wonderful wine selection with fun atmosphere.  Will keep trying to replicate their 3 cheese macaroni & cheese dish."}
{"text":"Babbo Italian Eatery has the best spaghetti I've ever had!  Monday and Tuesday it is only 5.99!  Their meatballs are to die for.  If you want some damn good spaghetti go to Babbo's on Monday or Tuesday, you will not be disappointed!

The bread and olive oil are amazing too!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this establishment running errands and glad we did. Friendly staff and very good food. Had chipolte chicken pasta and it was very good. Next time I must try the pizza. Great ambience, value and location."}
{"text":"Eorth a trip for pasta or their salads. Both are wonderful. And if you like garlic they know what you mean when you say xtra garlic. They actually give you extra. Yummm. Of course you will probably not be kissing anyone that night."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. The bread before lunch was fantastic. I ordered a mista salad and it was perfect. The mac and 3 cheese was amazing. A little bite to it with sausage and bacon. Our server Andrea was superb. She was helpful with the menu, friendly, and even gave us water to go. If you are in the area make sure to stop by you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever and we go here all the time but tonight I don't know what happened first off our waiter named Alex was a rude and greasy looking like he just rolled of bed  20 minutes before he came back to take our order then we were there for almost a hour before they came out with our sandwiches. And they were not busy at all service sucked and to top it off my wife's meat in her sandwich was ice cold. Bull.... then we asked him to get the manager and he laughed what a joke alex is a bad waiter... so she came to the table and we told her we have never had a experience like this and service sucked that we just wanted the sandwich made right and a to go box....... she brought the sandwich and it was hot and a box the check she's like I took the sandwich off ... ok cool but that's not what it's about the service sucked and the hole night while we were there hope you guys can learn from this"}
{"text":"First let me say my husband had a great experience. The place was very loud - way too loud. The service was lacking considering it is a dining establishment and not fast food. I have a dairy allergy and asked for a salad with no dressing except lemon juice and olive oil. I got a Cesar salad twice and then a dry salad. It seemed no one understood the words coming out of my mouth. My husbands food was good and even though it was barely luke warm he said it was edible and good once we took it home and heated it up."}
{"text":"From the start to the end this place was pretty much horrible.  The worst Birthday dinner and service that I have ever had. (I will say that my waiter was a champ).  when I walked into the place they were semi busy but I had made a reservation because it was for a group of 12.  I walked up to the hostess stand to check in which the hostess was there but yet didn't greet me for what felt like 10 minutes it was probably closer to 5.  We were seated shortly after checking in and the waiter did come over fairly quickly and was super nice.  The part that was not good was the FOOD, a lot of the bread that was brought out was burnt, a majority of the meals that were brought out were burnt and one friend of mine did not like hers so was going to order something else but the manager was very rude about it.  The manager said the kitchen was about to close so she needs to hurry up in a very rude manner.  The checks were messed up so they had to be redone.  Had to be reminded of the desert that was ordered but the kitchen was closed by that time so we couldn't get what we had then wanted.  Needless to say bad first impression unfortunately and definitely won't be going back!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place is in Surprise. The food has been great dining in or for take out. The staff is always friendly and fast even during busy nights. I love the pizzas and Alfredo Supremo. I recently tried the Italian sandwich and it was great! You have plently of leftovers and for a great price. I love this place. You can also keep asking for more bread and they won't judge :)"}
{"text":"An Italian restaurant that can't seem to keep an Italian classic like lasagna on hand. I've gone twice with the same results. No lasagna. The only reason I went in the first place."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Awesome apps with massive entrees. Father's Day dinner and was crowded but service was on it!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed eating dinner here last night.  It was busy because they have a spaghetti special Tuesday nights.  The wait wasn't too long at the time.   My husband enjoyed the spaghetti and (huge) meatballs!  I had a delicious chicken chopped salad.  It had lots of good items like peppers, cheese, chicken and salami  -   and the dressing was really tasty, not over vinegary!  

We will go back, as it is in a good  location and the hostess and our server were very friendly.   They were nice to the elderly people who were there.   I like the atmosphere.  

It is a small place but they do have a nice patio and also can accommodate larger groups in one corner of the restaurant.  

Our bill was reasonable thanks to the special.  It's not too often we can go out to a sit-down place for a little over $20.   

I say give it a try if you haven't been there yet."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. We ordered and it was at our table in 5 minutes. Makes you wonder how it is all cooked that fast and how fresh is it.......Food was ok. Didn't taste bad but not something I would go eat again. I could see grabbing take out for a quick week night dinner from here in a pinch, but don't see myself eating there again other than that."}
{"text":"After a Lil bump in the road of waiting awhile after being seated to get served the rest of the service was awesome. 
The food is awesome the bread you get when you first sit down is so fresh and the vinegar/oil mixture is very good quality.
The mista salad is awesome. The dressing is l awrsome and a great mixture of greens. 
The entrée are great quality and nice portion sizes.

We will definitely be back..

Four and a half stars..."}
{"text":"My husband and I love the crab and artichoke dip, but we make sure to substitute the focaccia bread - we could make a meal out of that. This is why we always have leftovers from our dinner portions! The creamy mushroom and asparagus pasta is delicious, too, and we sometimes add shrimp to it. The 3 cheese mac n cheese is pretty tasty  as well."}
{"text":"Good place for pizza and pasta, staffs are friendly, good value!"}
{"text":"Babb's has fantastic italian food on the casual level. The pizza is decent, but the ultimate favorite for me has been the fettuccine...  well-made cream sauce and lots of yummy veggies.   -A glass of wine and you're set!"}
{"text":"my wife and i ate here for the first time thursday afternoon 4/18/13...our server was marshall and he did an excellent job!! the place was fairly busy and all went smooth food was great...the only dissapontment was right behind us sat a couple of owners or managers and they were discussing business at a level that was hard to ignore..i really dont want to hear about comparisons of last years numbers and their projections for how slow summer will be and champagne vinegarettes etc.etc. etc.!!! thats what they make offices for..."}
{"text":"Babbo is one of our favorite restaurants in the Valley. We have always had attentive servers and an enjoyable experience and we have frequented the Surprise location about once a week for 2 years now. They have an extensive, creative and delicious menu. I have tried 2/3 of the menu because every item can be made vegetarian. You can also substitute whole grain pasta, which is just as fabulous. My favorite meals are the Pear Gorgonzola Pizza, Sun Dried Tomato, Mushroom and Asparagus Pasta, and the new Brussels Sprouts Pasta, which is amazing even without the meat item that usually comes in it. My family loves the Curry Chicken Pear Pasta and Alfredo and of course the seasoned bread that accompanies the meal."}
{"text":"Wow isn't the word, so I recently got recommended this restaurant and came to check it out with the wife and I must say the food was awesome! But the waiter was horribly rude and had no personality at all!!! This put a bad taste to our opinion. We will try to come back another time and will definitely ask for a different waiter.. 

Who knows maybe he was having a bad day, even though it's a people and customer service business I still believe you should be 100% with every table!"}
{"text":"I met an older lady at Target last night that recommended I visit this restaurant to visit. She told me to get the lasagna. Holy moly.... It take a lot like my grandma's. I would recommend this place to.all of those who love Italian foods!"}
{"text":"Just drove by & stopped in to give it a try. Had the personal pan pizza, tomato, basil & goat cheese. It was awesome. Service was prompt & very friendly. I'm looking forward to taking my wife here because of the cozy atmosphere. Loved it."}
{"text":"We'd been watching them overhaul the new Tempe location for over a year now, and I was hoping that the time they were taking with the construction would be reflected in the quality of their food. Plus, we've been hoping for something different to choose from, as we're so burned out on all the other restaurants in the Warner Ranch/Casa Paloma area, and really had high expectations for babbO.

Alas...

Went here for Mother's Day. The hostesses tried to jam us into a tiny table against the window, next to a HUGE party (~16 ppl)... not you don't. Finally got the table that had just been sitting there, empty, for 20 minutes, while three of them debated whether to put us at the window table, pointing at us and at that tiny table as they talked. Oh boy.

Everything initially was fine, plus we had great service with our waitress - she really took care of us (I can't remember her name, but she was a tall girl with bleached blond hair, a dazzling smile, and a great sense of humor), hence the three stars. The breadsticks are to die for and so is their pistachio mozzarella appetizer. My blood orange margarita tasted more like really acidic grapefruit juice, which was a bummer; no more bar orders for me here other than beer.

The entrees were very disappointing, which is where I'm dinging them. My husband frowned after the food was delivered and muttered, \"I sense Costco grade something.\" He got pasta primavera (I think with chicken added), I got the pasta limone with chicken, and our son got meatballs off the kids' menu. We liked our food in general, but it wasn't sensational. I think my husband was right in that the chicken was precooked and frozen, because the texture and taste was off. Not horrible, but definitely not fresh. I will say our son devoured the meatballs, but he's a hungry kid, so...

The food was definitely not worth the $50 bill.

I guess we'll give them another shot when they work the knots inherent in a busy opening weekend. However, the first impression food-wise isn't really great.

Oh, and by the way, don't make a big deal that a dish has fusilli pasta (bolded and in red on the menu like it's the coolest thing ever!) - served with FUSILLI!!omglolzers kinda crap -  when it's just spiral pasta you can get in a mac and cheese box. That wasn't fusilli, guys. I know that's kinda nitpicky, but unneeded pretension is just dumb."}
{"text":"Great calzone and pizza. I also like the wedge salad. Can't get a good wedge salad at many places anymore. They give you Italian bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar before your meal. Delish."}
{"text":"The first time we ate here, we were impressed with the food and the service.  But recently, we took an out of towner guest in here and to our disappointment , the CREAMY chicken fettuccine's sauce was watery that one would need a bib to avoid splatter to your clothes. We brought this to the attention of the waiter who said that he will request cook to make sauce creamy before we ordered but that did not happen.  The chicken with artichoke came up lukewarm. And last but not least, the cosmopolitan my lady friend ordered was very diluted and you can't even taste alcohol on it.  Needless to say, we returned that drink.  The only good food we enjoyed is the hot delicious  bread we were served.  Too bad!  We thought we found a new place to enjoy a meal but this place is way off."}
{"text":"Had to wait 45 minutes, along with several other people, while there were 3  tables for four open the whole time. I love the food but horrible service.
Also observed employee putting clean silverware wrapped in napkin on the back of the booth where people's heads and hair were, while cleaning the table; disgusting!
We won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here quite a bit because it is one of the other restaurants that pay attention to food allergies. We love to split a small pizza and get the chopped chicken salad. Everything is always fresh and always delicious. They have really great lunch specials. You can get a small salad and a pretty good size of pasta. The bread they serve with the olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette is always warm and soft. Definitely worth eating. Servers are always really friendly also."}
{"text":"This is my first day in Arizona and I am beyond impressed with this place!  We sat outside, a beautiful evening where we can hear the music playing. The wine, bread, and our meals were just delicious and extremely reasonably priced based on California. We had Jimmy and a trainee server Justin. Justin was very honest with how long the lasagna would take on such a busy night. Very impressed. Amazing food and friendly service. I will certainly be back again!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could now give this place 0 stars. After my initial review of Babbo Italian Eatery I was told to contact them through an email address that they provided. I did and received no response. I then tried to contact them through a Yelp message directly, and still no response. I am now completely and utterly disgusted with Babbo for the severe lack of customer service and neglect of their customers. It was one thing to have a negative experience and state that I (may) never go back, and be contacted by someone from their establishment who \"claims\" to want to rectify the problem, only to be ignored. So for anyone who loves Italian food and wants good, quality service with delicious food at a great price, try Red Devil. Here's there website: http://www.reddevilrestaurant.com/"}
{"text":"This place always hit the spot for something tasty good. Portions are huge! 

The service seems to be caring. 

I enjoy that.

The bread- MMMMM
The pasta- great!
The 'zone - HUGE.

Great deal. Good food. Good Service. 
Easy 5 stars."}
{"text":"It was okay. Not bad, but not super great either. I can see why people like it. Edible and cheap. Most people only care about those two things, and quality is a distant if never considered quality.

Food was pretty bland in all honestly, not very flavorful and it tasted like the sauces they used had probably been watered down and reconstituted. But, it was not very expensive either, so really what can you expect? 

I ordered the garlic shrimp, and my dinner companion the bolognais. We ended up switching as neither of us was really enjoying our dish, yet we both had the same complaints about each dish. Lacking in flavor, watery sauce. The shrimp in my dish there were about 7 shrimp altogether, and it looked like the kind of shrimp you can buy in those half-ring packets at the grocery store for $5.99 a lb. 

Service was fine, environment was fine, I had a bellini which was extremely sweet but strong enough that I felt it after the first few sips. 

We also had the bruschetta appetizier, we chose the pear and walnut blue cheese which had a dried pear on top (it had an unpleasantly chewy texture), the shaved ribeye with blue cheese and balsamic (it was more like fried steak-umm meat or jerky than it was rib eye) and one with salami and pesto, which was actually really good, but the watery constitution of the sauce made the bread extremely soggy. 

The bread was fresh and the pasta was probably fresh as well, although they should really salt the pasta water or buy a better quality pasta or something because between the bland pasta and the watered down, bland sauces nothing had any flavor.

The place was also packed, which gave a false impression of being really good. We assumed since there were a ton of people, it must be a good place, right? My guess is that the place probably has a strong group of locals who either don't mind the subpar food or don't know that it is subpar. 

But, like I said, it's cheap, and it's edible, it's heavy and filling carbs which people like. I didn't refuse to eat it, but I wouldn't go there again, and although we took the leftovers with us, neither of us actually wanted to eat them later and they were thrown away."}
{"text":"We ended up eating here more by chance than anything else, and we LOVED it. Machaela was super sweet and genuine. She pretty much made our day. The food came out quickly and was super tasty. And they even sent us out with bread that had just finished baking. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant tonight for dinner. Was seated promptly by hostess. But was totally ignored by wait staff. Sat there for 10 minutes, not one person approached our table. Other diners came in and were waited on promptly. Got up and left after 10 minutes. This is totally unacceptable and we will not return. If I could give zero or negative stars.... I would!"}
{"text":"The meatballs at Babbos are probably the best around. Love the selection of salads,usually get the spicy green bean & arugula. Tonight I tried the kale & quinoa salad and it was very tasty.Quentin was our server & was very attentive even though it was a full house."}
{"text":"This place is our regular spot. Love the food and love the people. Last night was the exception to the rule. We went and they were quite busy so we were willing to be flexible. We were never even asked about wanting water. The server forgot the bread. I had to ask her several times for various items that were ordered and forgotten. I'm glad this was not my first experience with this place because if it were, I'd be unlikely to come back."}
{"text":"This is a good place...I had the spicy sausage and peppers pasta with a ceasar salad and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Great restaurant   & food!!! Only thing that could be worked on is staff acknowledging customers arriving for order pick-up. A couple times I've waited at the bar almost 10 minutes before the guy even acknowledged me. Good is always great tho!"}
{"text":"Babbo's is about as American Italian as you can get.  The food is ok and the service is usually pretty good but if you really want Italian food I would recommend you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"A trendy, upscale\"ish\" restaurant on the east side? Finally! Loved the food, loved the decor. Now just needs some a clientele under 60 ;')"}
{"text":"Delicious!  I'm new to the area and this is now one of my favorite dining spots. The pizza is the best the area has to offer. And so far the meals are tasty and light for Italian. Prices are reasonable. They have a nice \"to-go\" service and if your meal isn't ready when you pick it up you can always have a drink at the bar."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very inattentive and very slow. She never checked on us to ask how my food was and I had to flag her down every time  I needed something (I felt like I was bothering her). She literally just handed me my food and didn't come back until we ordered dessert. Desert took 25 minutes before it came out. I do want to mention that she checked on the people behind us multiple times. My biggest issue was being sat at the smallest table and the waitress never came to pick up our dishes, so basically I sat at a table full of dirty dishes, trying to eat my entree! It was just an overall unprofessional act on Babbo's end. I will not be going here again and definitely will not recommend Diana to anyone. The food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Great food, every time we eat here we're never disappointed! The pizza has a thin delicious crust and the pasta tastes homemade and very fresh. Love the olive oil and balsamic they serve with the bread. Nine bucks for the lunch combo for either pasta and salad or pizza and salad. Would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! Their service was very prompt, even with the wait. I would give 5 stars if it were not for the very uncomfortable wait. There is no where to go. Very small \"lobby\" for lack of a better term.

The Mac n cheese was awesome with sausage and bacon. Amazing. My other half had the spaghetti and she really enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"My daughters love the italian drinks and bread."}
{"text":"1st time there.  Very good service.; wait staff is very attentive, despite a very busy evening .  (20 min wait )
Bread and salads were very tasty and the pizza was excellent.
Seemed to have a robust take-away business.  
We will be back."}
{"text":"I have loved Babbo for years! The Arrowhead location is just down the street from my parents house, and we go all the time, It's our go-to restaurant for both a casual meal out and when we have company in town and want to take them somewhere that is both close to home, but not a big national chain.
All that being said, I have rarely had a wonderful experience as I did last Friday when I had dinner at the Surprise location with my boyfriend and our friends.
Our server, Dylan I think was her name, was absolutely amazing and just made the meal spectacular. She had two plates of the delicious Babbo bread at our table almost as soon as we sat down, and was quick about getting me some of the garlic butter I always ask for. Seriously-- get the garlic butter with your bread next time you go! Yum!
But other than that Dylan was super sweet, and seemed genuinely happy to help us. Her service rivaled service I've had at some of the Valley's nicest restaurants.
The food was great too, but that's always true for me. Babbo is one of my restaurants at which I always order the same thing, since it's so darn good. My dish of choice is the Tomato-Mozzarella Pasta. You can't go wrong with creamy lumps of cheese and fresh tomato in a light olive oil sauce. My mouth is watering...
My boyfriend got one of the pizzas, and our friends both ordered other pasta dishes, which they all enjoyed-- and were happy to share so we could all get a taste!
I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at Babbo tonight! Seated right away, server came to our table right after we were seated for our drink order.  Wine is good and very reasonably priced.  All 3 of the entrees we ordered were amazing! Even the bread is delicious! Nicole was our server and she couldn't have been more accommodating. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I drove around looking for somewhere to eat since I'm in Phoenix on business.  I passed this place on the way in and kind of just ended up there.  I was greeted by Nathalie who, seeing that I was the only one in my party, suggested that I sit at the bar which I was completely amenable to. 

Chrissie, the bartender was a delight.  I watched as she deftly handled many customers, both in-house and to-go, with a smile and a heartfelt cheeriness.  Everyone working there seemed to be in a good mood and ready to help.  I asked her about the \"chalkboard\" specials where you pick either chicken or portabello, a topping of some kind of vegetable of which there were many to choose from, then a salad.  I ordered chicken with beets and brussels sprouts and a mista salad.  

The salad set the tone with black olives, tomatoes, basil, lots of spring lettuce tossed in a house vinaigrette - it was an unforgettable salad.  My food came just as I finished my salad.  The chicken was cooked perfectly by Eduardo and was topped with roasted brussels sprouts and beets with goat cheese and almonds and came with a side of roasted broccoli, cauliflower, red onions and carrots.  

My brain is still very happy for having this gastronomical treat.  I got a big ole SE grin on my face while I was eating it because it was JUST THAT GOOD.  A couple came in after I finished and I wanted to tell them all about the food but they were regulars and were already well-equipped for this place.  As a matter of fact, the lady's usual was the meal I had just had!

I joined Yelp tonight just so I could write this review.  Babbo, if you need a marketing person, please give me a call cuz I just joined the choir."}
{"text":"Monday and Tuesday - 1/2 price for great spaghetti and 2 HUGE meatballs.  Atmosphere isn't fancy but service is excellent and all servers are very attentive.  Bradford from California was our server and he was efficient, polite and very fun.  Great place for families.  Salads were great and large.  Highly recommend - good value for the money."}
{"text":"First of all....the bread is amazing.
I could go there for bread and alfredo sauce and sit there for 3 hours...

I ordered the  Spicy Alfredo with Italian Sausage.
They aren't kidding, its spicy. Good flavor but the sauce was a bit thin.

Wife ordered the Three Cheese Mac and Cheese.
Good flavor but spicier then my wife was expecting.....so I had to eat the left overs.....darn it...
Very good mac n cheese.

Service was great, the waiter got a christmas dollar(extra dollar over 20%) that i usually save for December...XD

I will be back...."}
{"text":"We found Babbo on Yelp and decided to try it on Tuesday for spaghetti and meatballs @ $5.99.  The arugula and bean salad was delicious and the spaghetti was tasty. 

It was a little noisy, but the server was pleasant and helpful. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. The decor was excellent. The service was pathetic. The wait times at the table were unbearable. The waitress had no concept of customer service or appreciation. The manager was of absolutely no help. I tried to use an old gift certificate that has no expiration date. I was told that I couldn't use it because, \"we don't have the funds for these anymore.\" I pray the Federal Reserve doesn't start using that excuse for our dollar! What a shame.  It's a rare experience to have a restaurant with such a good product and such poor service."}
{"text":"I get the Drunken Shrimp Pasta (Shrimp Sauteed in a Tequila Lime Butter Sauce. Topped with  Pico, Fresh Limes and served on Spaghettini.)  It's so good !  I don't do spicy food , but this has the mildest kick to it . If I'm not in the mood for pasta, I get the Steak n' blue salad (Romaine Lettuce, Tomatoes, Walnuts. Thinly-Sliced Rib Eye Steak*, Sauteed with Mushrooms, Mixed Peppers, and Onions. Topped with Blue Cheese in a Sweet Vinaigrette.)  absolutely my favorite salad in town !"}
{"text":"Disappointing...

I have eaten at Babbo's since it opened. I like their food (salads, Pasta Martini, Pasta Valducci, sandwiches), but their management seems to have taken a slide in recent years. 

Recently, a waiter spilled four glasses of red wine and spattered a dinner companion's shoes, pants, and shirt. The waiter was obviously new and inexperienced. They took forever to clean up the mess --and the manager was at the bar --near where we were sitting. 

The manager could not be bothered to come over immediately. We had to ask for something to clean up my companion and let them know that there was a problem. We also had to ask for a manager to come by --who took what seemed about 10 minutes. --We had actually finished prior to the spill and had to sit there and wait and wait --first for the clean-up and then for the manager.
 
When the manager arrived she said she would pay our tab of about $20 for our inconvenience. My dinner companion voiced her concerns that her outfit might be ruined by the red wine. The manager said she would pay for dry cleaning. My companion asked what would happen if it didn't come out. The manager snapped in a nasty tone that she should bring in original receipts for the clothing and shoes. 

The manager then went to the bar and berated the waiter (within earshot of our table), telling him that he would have to pay if my companion had a problem with her outfit. 

My companion went home and immediately laundered everything. Luckily, it all came out. We used to go to Babbo's regularly, but haven't been back since. The food is good, but when management creates a problem atmosphere --it's just not worth it. A new waiter and an accident are all forgivable. But rudeness on the part of management to customers (and staff) really put me off.

By the way, Dolores, the manager, never apologized, but the waiter did. He may have been inexperienced, but he knew the value of being polite."}
{"text":"Drea is that best bartender around. Good conversation and always has a great smile on her face. Great food and great service. Love this place"}
{"text":"Oh Babbo. I love you, but you've done me wrong this time. 

I have been to Babbo a few times and a few different locations. The first Babbo experience i had was the one located in Cave Creek, and it was amazing. I was eating dairy then, and had the Alfredo Supreme. The bread at the table is so good. And I tried one of my sisters zucchini chips. Those are addicting. The next two times I went to the Babbo located in Phoenix. I had the chalkboard menu with the portabello with beets and brussels sprouts. It was good, but greasy. The side of vegetables were dried out and gross though. The time after that I was no longer eating dairy, so I had the Roasted Brussels SproutBeet Salad with no cheese, and I really liked it.

I had been waiting for this location in Tempe to open up for quite awhile. I drove by the space a few months ago and when it said \"Babbo coming soon!\" I got so excited. I added Babbo to my facebook and waited for the day that it opened. Well, last week we got the chance to finally go and we decided to take my mom for her birthday dinner. 

From the start, we could tell the experience was not going to be that great. It was busy, which was because it had just opened. But this location has such a small waiting area. You are almost forced to stand outside in the 100 degree heat to wait for a table. It took us about twenty minutes to get a table, which wasn't that bad. We had noticed when we walked in that there was this fat old guy in a chefs hat circling the tables. We were making jokes about how the chef should be in the kitchen, and not visiting tables. If he was the chef and wasn't cooking, who was? Anyways, we sat down and looked at our menus. I noticed the new roasted garlic hummus and we ordered that. I double checked with the waitress that there was no dairy in it and told her that I also have a dairy allergy as well as being vegan. So after we ordered that and it came out we ordered dinner. My husband ordered the Amalfi pizza, I ordered the brussels sprout beet salad again with no cheese, and my mom ordered a pasta dish. The hummus came out and it was pretty darn amazing. I wanted to order like a tub of it to take it home with me. I am going to have to go home and experiment with roasted garlic in my hummus. We seemed to be waiting a long time for our food, which also was expected because it was so busy. Not once, but TWICE, the old fat guy in the chefs hat came by to see how we were doing. He saw both times we had no food and claimed he was going to go find out about why it was taking so long but instead he just walked to the next table. 

So probably another ten minutes goes by and finally the food comes out, and before the waiter has even dropped the food on the table I already see there is cheese on my salad. Before he sets it down I tell him I ordered it with no cheese because I am allergic. So he tells me he is going to get me a new one. Less than a minute later the salad comes back and he goes \"Ok we just did a quick swap\" Which I assumed meant they had another one ready back there and gave me a new one. No, it meant he went back there and scraped off the cheese and gave me the same salad. NOTE TO RESTAURANTS EVERYWHERE: this does not fool customers even in the slightest. I have had multiple establishments do this to me in the past and I can always tell. They seem to think the customer is retarded and can't see the tiny specs of cheese still clinging to lettuce leaves. So I refuse to eat it of course, and the waitress comes back and I tell her that the cheese has just been scraped off and there is still some in the actual salad. She tells me how sorry she is and goes to make me a new one. It was another fifteen minutes before I received a new one, which at that point I just wanted to go home. The manager, I am assuming, and the old fat chef come to the table to tell me how sorry they are and how inexcusable it was. They made the excuse that the cook was new, but I am sorry, that shouldn't happen anywhere. Food allergies are a serious thing and cooks should receive training on it before they even step foot in the kitchen. 

So we eat and finish, and here is the part that makes me angry. The waitress comes by and tells us to save room for dessert because its on them. Uhhh.... I don't eat dairy or eggs, yet they are going to salvage their mistake with dessert? Makes a whole lot of sense. NOT! So instead of offering to take off my salad for my inconvenience they don't do anything, and we didn't get dessert.

And then here is the kicker.... My husband ended up in the hospital the next morning at 5am because the pizza he ate here was so greasy, it aggravated his gallstones (which were diagnosed that morning at the hospital) and now he has to have surgery to have his gallbladder removed. So thanks for that Babbo.

I am giving this one star because my experience here was just so outrageous, it felt like a bad joke that I didn't get the punchline to."}
{"text":"This place is great! I really liked the bread they give you here. Pasta here is fresh and not fake tasting like some other well known Italian places. Good run restaurant with an attentive staff. I rarely cheat on my strict diet but if I do I make sure to have some pasta from here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought home his leftovers which was one of the sandwiches from Babbo. As soon as I had it, I had to go to the place where they served this deliciousness. 

The focaccia is probably the best bread I've ever had. It's fresh, warm, soft, perfectly seasoned. It was great with just olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and also on the chicken Caesar sandwich which I had without the buffalo sauce. Zucc chips are nice change of pace but unnecessary with the amount of food that you get.

They were very, very busy on a Sunday for lunch but the staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Good local Italian, tons of different pasta dishes & they are usually good at special request orders too (like aiding or omitting ingredients & substituting whole wheat pasta) .  Salads are good too."}
{"text":"Average food, average wait service, good happy hour. Staff can be dizzy. Take-out has been a better experience."}
{"text":"okay, so i love all things buffalo so i think of myself as a buffalo connoisseur. and they had some of the best buffalo chicken i've ever had, anywhere. i had the buffalo chicken sandwich/salad (but it wasn't really a sandwich). the bread was amazing. the service was great, and we had a pretty large group. i highly recommend and i will for sure go back if i'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here probably 30x and is always a 10/10. Usually get the food to go and even after a 15 minute drive the food is still amazing. Bread and bruschetta selections are second to none."}
{"text":"This is a such a good restaurant! The service is quite friendly and the food came out rather fast (though it wasn't? busy by any means, about 1/3 full, so that probably explains it). I really like the decor also, it gives a welcoming feel. I had the stuffed manicotti with sausage, and man was I stuffed after that! It was a well prepared, savory and delicious dish. One thing to know when coming here, the portions are generous."}
{"text":"I am new to the area so I was excited to try a new Italian food place. My husband and I go in and the customer service was great we didn't have to wait to be seated. Our waiter came by a few minutes later got us out drinks and then helped my husband with his order and getting what he wants. ( wasn't on menu what he wanted) then I order some pasta. The food came out and was absolutely AMAZING!!!! oh my gosh seriously some of the best food I have ever ate! 
I will be returning and definitely trying out some of my favorite dishes. I would give this place a try your tastebuds and belly will be happy."}
{"text":"I ordered the brussel sprout and pancetta pasta. It was disgustingly greasy. I didn't even take the left overs home. It was like drinking oil. I couldn't, I can't, and I won't. I was thinking brussel spouts would be healthy, but not in this pasta. Very disappointed. 

My brothers spaghetti looked okay. 

The waiter was very attentive and nice.  One star for him."}
{"text":"This place is nicely decorated, but the service was what ever, they weren't rude, but they weren't friendly by any means. I'm 9 months pregnant with an anxious 3 year old. They took so long to bring our food out, didn't even apologize for the wait either. So I was uncomfortable, my daughter was extremely bored. What should have been your typical 40 minute lunch outing, ended up lasting an hour and half. This stuff matters with toddlers.. trust me I was close to having them make our food to go just to get my daughter home. lastly, they didn't have a lunch menu.. there were two things on the menu for lunch but what a joke. we will be taking our business back to rigatonis on Warner and McClintock for Italian food and for their lunch menu which is 10x more reasonably priced and taste better. Just thought we'd try something new.. this place is no big deal.. better then Olive Garden, I'll give them that. Maybe if I was sipping on wine, had the day to waste and no kids., I would have had a better experience.. but come on, I've been to nicer upscale places with my child and have had way better experiences."}
{"text":"BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN ARIZONA! I don't think I can ever move out of state, I would miss this place too much! Their free dinner bread is the best bread around! I don't know what they do to it, but I eat at least 3 loaves each time I go! Their adult mac and cheese is like nothing I have ever tasted. Its spicy  but ohhh so delicious. Their steak and blue salad is outstanding..I have had so many things on the menu and am never disappointed. I LOVE THIS PLACE! Oh and the prices are amazing for the quality you get!  $12 a plate on average with free unlimited delicious bread, ummmm yes please!"}
{"text":"Pretty good!  We've had take-out (their online ordering is super and pickup was really fast!) and I've eaten there for lunch.  Lunch was a tad slow, but the food was yummy.  The asparagus-mushroom penne is one of my favorites and we all love the bread and oil/balsamic vinegar to dip it in.  While I give points for being able to customize my meals (I skipped the sun dried tomatoes in my penne, for example, or you can add shrimp, chicken, or a meatball.), I got carried away the second time and ordered the pasta rustica (Boring! Not recommended!) with whole wheat pasta and that really ruined the dish.  By the time I got it home, the pasta had absorbed most of the sauce and turned it into a gluey mess.  Not so tasty.

We're anxious to try the pizza, but will probably do take-out for that, too."}
{"text":"Well I give it a 2 star review for a good bruschetta app, Everything else was sub par. Not having straws eek!, small portions -that blows, food tasting bad and bland -well atleast I tried it since I keep seeing their billboards everywhere.  Dont know why anyone would go here , I would rather eat spaghettios."}
{"text":"Went for the first time on a Saturday night. 
There was no wait & I did think the restaurant itself was clean & nice ..but that's where my positive remarks stop !
I ordered a gargazola chopped salad & goat cheese pizza .. and a coke 
My coke was warm with very little ice ..the food took 30 min to arrive.
The salad was wilted and had horrible pieces of chicken in it.
The pizza was like no other goat cheese pizza I've ever had ..terrible!
My daughter's pizza was super greasy & my husband's food was OK.
I asked for some ice & more napkins that never arrived.
I was disappointed that our dinning experience wasn't better because I've been looking forward to trying this place. But after all that & a $60 tab we won't be back."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful but the food is bad. 4 of us got 4 different pastas and we all had the exact same pre-cooked chicken that was obviously not prepared to go with anyone's dish. It was bad. I had gone once before and the pizza was decent. Too bad the food doesn't match the decor."}
{"text":"Have been here twice for lunch. The service could be improved just a little, but overall, I was pleasantly surprised with our experience. There is small slices of bread & balsamic vinegar served as you wait. The lunch special is a rather large portion and I think worth the price. You can order salad/pasta or salad/pizza combo. I have done the pizza combo both times and was equally pleased with taste and size!"}
{"text":"Amazing meatballs, each bite is full of flavor. And the bread they give you is just wonderful. They have not failed to amaze me with the amazing taste of their food."}
{"text":"Ate here the other night and had a wonderful time.  The wait staff was extremely helpful in explaining the menu items and made it easy to choose.  By far the favorite was the pick three trio bruschetta that we started with at the table.  Being able to choose different flavors was a wonderful way for our group to start.

Everyone was pleased with their pasta choices.  Mine was the spicy sausage fettuccine.  It was very tasty and the fennel in the sausage was lovely.  I will totally be back to try some of their items.  The pizzas looked really good too!"}
{"text":"I like most of what I've tried at Babbo's. I love the pasta primavera (my fav) and completely love the bread they bring out while waiting for the food. For their menu, I like the items I've tried, but my wife has never cared for any of it (she usually tries something different every time - I usually just stick to something I like). It is a worthwhile place to try, but it can be hit or miss at times. People I know either love it or don't care at all for it, don't really know anyone in the middle."}
{"text":"After dinner my boyfriend said, \"I feel like I walked in, I laid down, they shoveled amazing food in my mouth, then rolled me out the door.\" Yeah, amazing!! The meat sauce was a bit meaty for my tastes, but everything we ate was incredible, and the prices are just as amazing!! 

I especially enjoyed the bruschetta choices, as well as the apple calzone for dessert. They truly won me over by having authentic Limoncello, which is an uncommon find in the states. Yummy!! I'd recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Sorry, I thought their pizza was terrible.  Even two stars is generous.  A long time ago, before I knew any better, I had supermarket frozen pizza better than the Amalfi pizza we had tonight.  Do people know what good pizza is?"}
{"text":"This place has the best service and good food to match.  It is also affordable and quick yet has a very pleasant dining atmosphere.  It's better than other well known Italian chain food restaurants.  The bread is delicious!!  It is always served warm, soft with a little bit of crunch and so fresh.  I love the pistachio mozzarella.  It's caprese salad with little pieces of pistachio.  Sounds weird, but sooo good.  Also the balsamic drizzle that they use is slightly sweet and thick like a syrup and is very delicious!  You can't beat the $5.99 spaghetti and meatball special every Mon & Tues.  The meatballs are a good size and have great flavor (well seasoned)."}
{"text":"The only order for me- spaghetti and meatballs! So freaking good. Probably best I've had. Comes here often maybe once every two weeks for either a takeout or a dine in. They have it on special every Mondays and Tuesdays. Word of caution- you will be obsessed! Rating it 3 stars not because of the food but because of the service. I called ahead and order wasn't ready when I got here. We put in the order an hour early and it's not even busy. Good thing the food is great otherwise I won't tolerate this. It happens pretty frequently. Very sad."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Our server was unfortunately quite slow and forgetful.  Great selection of items also. Would have gave 4 stars if service was a little better."}
{"text":"We waited 45 minutes for our food. The table who came in after us was served first. It was like the local high school had volunteered to serve the night we were there. 

The Gorgonzola salad was pretty good. The chicken in it was clean- no gross grisly bits. They serve their salads on plates and in bowls that are obviously too small. So you end up spilling a lot off the sides.

The cheese pizza- the 4 y.o. liked it, the 7 y.o. and I did not.

The calzone was cool inside and undercooked.

The manicotti was \"pretty good\" (says my husband).

It's unfortunate because this place is so close to where we live and hike and go to the park and I really can't see myself choosing to go back. I'd go if others picked it but I'd only get that gorgonzola  salad."}
{"text":"Had the calazone. Best one I've ever had. Still stuffed two days later. Will be back soon and often!"}
{"text":"just left babbos and the service was SUPERB!! Our servers name was jacquline and she was Fab very attentive made conversation with us and was more like a friend than a server! Told us about the good food and drink selections. I got pasta rustica and my partner got chicken artichoke calzone both were great!! would definitely return. Big thanks again to Jacquline you really made our experience great & all servers should take lessons off you. 
Good Job."}
{"text":"We are definitely going back! Patio seating is a must and take advantage of the happy hour too. If you love garlic, this Italian eatery should be on your list."}
{"text":"Went early tonight, Wed., to beat the crowd but we beat the main cook. Salad was wilted, main course lacked flavor other than the taste of the scorched vegetables. Our previous visit was just ok but this was our last visit."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food comes to the table piping hot every time ! Staff is friendly & fun!"}
{"text":"We've only ever tried 2 items on their menu, so I'm only able to review those. 

Appetizer: Roasted Garlic Hummus. We absolutely love this dish. Even though we ran out of bread, out waitress brought us more at no charge. It's easy to fill up on this & have hardly any room left for the main course.

Main course: Three-Cheese Mac&Cheese. I'm not a mac&cheese fan at all, but I was talked into trying this dish. Since I wasn't expecting to like it, I was definitely surprised on how much I loved it!!! This dish is not your regular style thick mac&cheese, it's a more grown-up version with a creamier chipotle base. It was super delicious & I would definitely get it again."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here, but a recipe for success that seems to escape too many restaurants.  Good food, generous portions, and reasonable prices.  Don't misunderstand me--this isn't fine Italian cuisine, but is American-ized Italian food.  That isn't bad by any stretch, but don't expect something else.  Having said that, they execute on that strategy very well.  The location is nothing fancy, but that isn't why you come to eat someplace like this.  We're not far from here, so we get takeout about once a week."}
{"text":"I just don't know this place anymore. The kitchen is so slow that it really is no longer worth coming here. Perhaps ordering for pick up is an option. I am just very sad that my go to place in Surprise has fallen so low in customer service."}
{"text":"Food is good.
Service was very good.

We ordered 3 kinds of bruschetta and two pasta dishes. They were all good but nothing to go out of your way for. Save your money and get bruschetta at Postino's down the street instead.  Their bread was very flavorful and we had to ask for a second helping. The staff checked on us frequently but were not overbearing. I would return but not in a rush to do so."}
{"text":"First off, We only came here because of the Yelp Reviews.

I had a bad feeling once we walked in the door, and regretted not walking out almost 5 minutes after sitting down. We were seated right away. They were not super busy. Once seated we waited for about 10 minutes before being greeted by our server. The server was very awkward. He said Hi, I guess I am your server tonight, as if we were expecting someone else. The waiter had no knowledge of the menu. We got our salads, which were amazing, we waited a while for them too and we got them before we got our drinks. I ordered a Red Wine and the server brought me a white wine. I knew if I said anything it would just be bad so I walked over to the bar and swapped it out. We got our pasta and it was amazing. I had to ask for fresh pepper, it was not offered and the girl did not ask anyone else at the table if they cared for any, which of course they did. The food was great, but it looked like a cheap chain with great food. No candles or flowers on the table. I felt like Gordon Ramsey would be popping in anytime. I cannot complain about the food, because it was great. It looks like they hire a bunch 16 year olds with no food industry training. Their employees' need training and it should help the dining experience. Ordering out would be the best plan for this place until they get their act together."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars.  The food is good, actually really good considering the low key, almost Denny's like ambiance.  I had the chalkboard menu chicken, with Brussels sprouts and beets.  It was fresh and extremely tasty (and healthy).  We also ordered the mozza balls appetizer.  Way too big of an appetizer for two people.  But tasted good (very rich tasting).  I'd go back."}
{"text":"We love Babbo! Everything from the complimentary bread, vinegar, and oil, to the spicy macaroni and half baked cookie desserts. Great for take out too! The atmosphere inside is enjoyable and they have delicious cocktails."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, 11am-2pm time frame.  I usually order the Panzera (Panzanera?) salad with grilled chicken & balsamic dressing.  Yum!   The bread is great too.
Servers are very friendly & helpful, when it is super busy I've had a little wait to take my order - to be expected."}
{"text":"Very cute little restaurant that fits well with the neighborhood. I ordered online tonight because I saw they had gluten free pasta available. I arrive 15 minutes later as my food was just coming up. The bartender was extremely kind and seemed to have a great attitude. She was a shorter girl with brown hair. She packaged it up quickly and I was on my way. I arrived home 30 minutes later and my pasta was still piping hot! They cooked the gluten free pasta perfectly in my chicken Alfredo. I love the added vegetables. The only thing I would change is the chicken was very chewy, too overlooked. I'll be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible management. They accept call ahead reservations, get you there then tell you it will be a 45 minute wait. Food is cheap for a reason, service is awful. Buyer beware - you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Tasty puttanesca with sausage and chicken.  Waitress mentioned that it was very spicy, was I certain I wanted it?  I said yes, and it turned out to be maybe a 4 out of 10 on the spice scale.  They did forget the side salad I ordered.  Waitress used excuse it was busy, but place was only 75% full.  She was very nice and apologetic, and service was otherwise good.  Bread was tasty and soft."}
{"text":"First time here, good, sat outside, enjoyed the calzones.

Second time- asked to sit outside and was treated with shock! NO ONE has asked to sit outside in like a month.  Well, call me crazy, it's cloudy out and not hot, I'd like to be outside.  Hostess sighed heavily and took us outside, tossed menus and silverware on table and said \"I'll send someone out\"  Um, ok thanks?  So we waited outside for about 20 minutes. No one came.  Ever.  So we left.  Was looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Great food I like the all you can eat spagetti and meat balls on Monday.
They have outdoor seating and umbrellas it nice to eat outdoors when the weather is nice which is most of the time here in AZ"}
{"text":"Food was hot and delicious. Paul was a wonderful waiter. Added a to go order and it was done quickly. Definitely we will be back."}
{"text":"Honestly, I can't quite make up my mind about this place. The food is consistently good -- especially enjoy the salads -- but the service dips back and forth between being excellent and horrible. One time, we were on the patio for more than 15 minutes (yes, we timed it) without being approached, and there WERE a couple of waiters working the area, so we simply stood being ignored for a certain amount of time and left. Recently, when my husband and I were sitting at the bar, a staff member (think it was management) was on her cell phone having what was obviously a personal conversation. Then there have been times when the service was absolutely great, and our servers were extremely personable and efficient without being sycophantic. As former service industry employees, my husband and I place a high premium on good service. That being said, if you want excellent food and don't much care whether you get good or bad service, give this place a try. Hope this was helpful!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for lunch and it is outstanding.  They have great lunch specials for $9 and you cannot go wrong.  I keep coming back for their Pasta Rustico and Caesar salad.   My friend had a roasted veggie salad that she loved.  What's better?  They serve the BEST foccacia bread ever.  It is homemade and comes out warm.  If only I could have a glass of wine at lunch, it would even be more perfect.  How does this problem get solved?  Order some  bread to go and stick it in the microwave for 30 seconds before serving.  YUMMERS!!  I HAD to bring some home to my #1 to try and we froze it.  When we were ready for it, bring it out to room temperature and then nuke for 30 seconds.  Life is good with their bread and some wine.  It doesn't even need the EVOO and balsamic but pretty darn good as a nice little treat.  Okay, marinara sauce makes for some awesome dipping sauce as well.

Their parking lot is challenging during peak hours but well worth maneuvering.  You'll find the walk back to your car after a meal at Babbo a good idea so this, too, is good if you have to park across the lot.

Good service and only wished they would open a site in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best FRANCO AMERICAN In town.  Service is EXCELLENT!!!! THE FOOD.......OK.....pretty bland for Italian food.  My family is Sicilian, and this is not spiced correctly ...for my taste."}
{"text":"Food was acceptable.  Waiter was kind. We felt ignored and management was more selective and favoring other customers over us. When asking multiple times to get a workable heater,  it was given to customers who had just arrived. It wasnt about the 15 dollar certificate that we were offered and that we declined, it was about customer  service and  favoring one customer over another."}
{"text":"Great pasta dishes... Authentic Italian menu.  I leave happily stuffed every time.  Not too expensive either."}
{"text":"I love the Chicken Limone and the Mediterranean Olive Tepenade.   I can't wait to try other pasta dishes.   It is convient to order online and pick up.   If you live in the area, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great meatballs!  We love the Monday and Tuesday spaghetti special.  Probably the best money you could spend on dinner out.  Great service and atmosphere.  Small family dining.

Don't miss out."}
{"text":"We love going to this spot, good food. amazing bread! Seriously the bread is a reason alone to check this place out. Sitting on the patio is a treat with great view of superstition mountain. Salads are great and so are the sandwiches! One of our favorite lunch spots. Brett Russo"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first visit to Bobbo. Overall the food was good with a terrific selection of Pasta and Pizza. I selected the jambalaya fettuccine. It was spicy and tasty. They had a $6 bloody merry special all day Sunday that hit the spot. Our server was a young lady by the name of Bri. She was delightful. She check on us regularly and provided some suggestion on what to order. We felt the atmosphere was a bit to cafeteria style and was hoping for a more romantic setting. Food is good atmosphere needs help."}
{"text":"They say you can judge a place by how good it makes a simple spaghetti and meatballs. Well, if that it the case, then Babbo is an Italian classic that knows that it is doing. I came with my party of 6 on a MOnday night for the $6 spaghetti and meatballs. We had a reservation and were seated promptly, despite the place being packed. The nice warm bread that is served is like crack - and to make it like heroin - order the hummus dip. It is to die for. Our spaghetti dinners arrived, as did our side of alfredo sauce. We all love to mix the alfredo in with our tomato sauce - makes for a creamier sauce.It is some of the most delicious spaghetti and meatballs that I have ever had, and had enough to take for lunch the next day! I am looking forward to going back and have had the food there twice. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service. We ate late on staurday night and we were at the table visiting for at least a half hour after closing. The staff never made us feel rushed or unwelcomed. Great place!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and the service is fantastic.  You have to try the lasagna when you are there.  Special call out for Buddy, Kim, Angela, Danny and everyone else that just does a great job.  Thanks for the great food, service, and good times."}
{"text":"First time at Babbo's. So good!! Spinach and Gorgonzola linguine was creamy and very tasty. Meatball panino was very tender and flavorful. Service was fast! Waiter very attentive but not overly much. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my first time posting on yelp and its not good. I ordered the chicken limone for a 11.95 , added asparagus for 2.50 . ( you think for 2.50 I would mayb get 3 stalks of asparagus, literally I got 1 cut in half ) and for 3.95 a very very small salad. let me just say their is nothing more disappointing than when u have worked a long hard day, and u just want to grab TO GO food ,go home eat and relax. first lets start with tak
ing the food out of the bag , lemon butter sauce is everywhere but in my main dish as im unpackin my dinner which cost me $20 , i find my salad but no bread . now im mad really how can u forget the most important thing, being in the business i should of known to check my food before leavin but since they were not busy i just figured it would be all there. i proceed to call them and was informed to just ask for x bread on my next visit . I have been in the restaurant busy for many years and believed  they handle the situation poorly.  I wont ever go back there and if anyone asks my oppinion of the place i will tell them to get an Italian Banquet T.V. dinner it will be cheaper and the quality of the product is the same"}
{"text":"Delicious! Been several times and usually get the pasta puglia which is perfect. I'm Italian and grew up on the east coast so I know what the food should taste like! I did go one time and my food was cold?? I'm assuming they had a different Chef that day. Either way definitely 4 out of 5 stars. If anyone thinks otherwise I'm assuming they think real Italian food is made by Chef Boyardee ...Ketchup and Egg Noodles LOL"}
{"text":"This is not exceptional Italian food, but it is very consistent and good value for money. It is even better value with a coupon. We were seated within 5 minutes after being told the wait was 20 minutes. The server came to the table promptly to take the drink order and then followed up with the bread.  We had the pesto pasta and the Alfredo supreme both of which were good, but we really could have split one entree. With a glass of wine and soda, the total bill was under $30, with a 50% off one entree coupon, a great deal."}
{"text":"Walked in on a week night and seated immediately. Waiter was pleasant and the food came out pretty fast. Reasonable prices, great food, good portion sizes and nice staff. Babbo's is awesome!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly this place is very good. The service was good. I got the manicotti and will get it again. I would recommend this place to anyone that's working for fast Italian sit down food."}
{"text":"******This review was for my visit on Valentine's Day 2013*******

I LOVE this place! I think I visit at least once a month. It's a family favorite for sure.

Well, my anniversary actually falls on Valentine's Day so when it came to picking a place to have a romantic dinner, we actually wanted to come to Babbo's. So we both dressed up and without even a reservation, took a chance and drove to the restaurant. Surprisingly enough, it was only a 10 minute wait. We sat down and waited a very comfy couch and before I knew it, our name was called. They sat us by the wall where it was very intimate and romantic.

We were immediately served free bread and water. The bread is just amazing. It's a little addicting so be careful not to stuff yourself before dinner. We decided on an appetizer of toasted ravioli. First time I tried it and I was so happy we ordered it!! I normally order just their spaghetti and meatball but I was feeling adventurous so my server recommended the pasta martini. I almost ordered it just for the name!! The bf ordered a chicken and bbq calzone and he was a happy camper for sure!

While waiting for our food, a manager walked up to our table and explained that the pasta line was backed up and that he sincerely apologized for the wait and that he would give us an employee discount. I didn't even realize that 20 minutes went by. Our glasses were constantly refilled and the bread kept coming fresh from the oven. It was a pleasent surprise indeed.

What topped it off was the main course itself. The pasta martini was just AMAZING!!! Wasn't too saucy or too light. It was just right! We skipped dessert that evening because we were SO full from bread! They were gracious enough to pack the other half of our dinner that wasn't consummed as well as some extra bread to take home with us! What a team! The service was just wonderful! 

Thank you Babbo's for making my night!!"}
{"text":"We are new to the area and trying out different restaurants primarily due to the heat....who wants to cook at home with 110+ degree temperatures:)  The food was very good and the service was attentive and professional.  The portions are very generous."}
{"text":"You have to eat here, everything you try is amazing! Im sad that we moved away... but you can bet everytime we come to visit we are eating at Babbos!"}
{"text":"My first experience back in late 2012 was spot on.  Food was incredibly delicious.   Service was excellent.   Fast forward.  The place was almost empty at 5pm.  There was a group leaving.  The server forgot to bring us silverware after bringing out the appetizer.  She quickly walked off before my husband could say anything.  My husband went to an empty table to get four sets.  My pasta was okay.  I got the limon pasta.  I could have made it myself, I have the ingredients at home.  Chicken was dry.  Flavor just didn't hit the spot.  I think I could have made a better lemon caper sauce. My husband's jambalaya was good and so was the Manicotti.  Restaurant isn't consistent with their dishes.  Not sure if I want to go back again.  The firecracker rolls was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"We think that there food is some of the best Italian we have ever had there spaghetti and meatball (special on Mon. and Tue.) is to die for. Look folks this is a retirement area and there are also a lot of snowbirds in the winter and they are what keeps Surprise area going ,so enjoy there company. Go to McDonald's for dinner if you do not want the company of civilized well behaved adults."}
{"text":"Food was good, but I think they are a bit pricey... I personally think you are paying more the the decoration and location of the restaurant than the quality of the food.  Not super impressed, but also not turned off by it."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from Babbo several times and actually dined-in on a couple of occasions as well.  The food is good (not authentic Italian but good), the portions are generous, and the online order option for take out is super convenient.  Their calzones are my favorite!

Every time I have been in there, whether its picking up a take out order or dining in, I have always experienced super friendly and attentive service.  Once I placed an order online, had the hubby go pick it up and he managed to come home with the wrong order!  I took it back, explained the situation - they were super apologetic, found our order, and refunded our bill to boot for our trouble.  That is stellar customer service in my book."}
{"text":"Don't have any big expectations whenever you eat here.  Babbo's is neighborhood bistro, which means to me that they would be half a step above take out.  I've only eaten here twice and I've ordered a different pasta each time.  While food is nothing to write home about, the appetizers were creative and even incorporated Mid-East (hummus dip) and asian elements.  The food prices were reasonable and the kids portions were generous.  I wish they would expand their dessert menu since it only has three items.

Nevertheless, I HATE dining in here because of the wait staff.

I get it -- the wait staff is young, polite, and accomodating.  Then, they say/do something completely asinine that leaves you with such a horrible overall impression of this place.  The last time I dined inside there were annoying flies.   The waitress gave us an apology and a weird excuse - \"the area has a lot of horses so there are a lot of flies\"....ookkaay... I asked for to go boxes and she took the plates away.  After sitting there for five minutes, I find out that she discarded all the food instead.  $30 of barely touched food.  I was annoyed but in retrospect who wants to eat food covered in flies?  She was an otherwise sweet girl but next time...there won't be a next time."}
{"text":"Well, I can't comment on the food.  we went with my folks..we were seated and then, promptly ignored.  my husband asked the hostess if we had a server. she went looking ,  came back and informed us someone would be with us shortly.  10 minutes later still no one! so, we got up and left.  the hostess smiled and thanked us, having already forgotten that we hadn't ever been served."}
{"text":"We have been frequenting this Babbo location for a long time and will not be going back.  The food and customer service (manager) has continued to go down hill. Even though the prices have continued to rise the quality of the food has declined.  The chopped gorgonzola salad had always been a go-to for me, but the last few times I've ordered it all of the ingredients listed on the menu have not been in it (mozzarella cheese for one) and tonight the pear pieces were almost too hard to eat. Lots of lettuce and very little ingredients.  We ordered the roasted asparagus appetizer from the happy hour menu and received a few thin pieces of overcooked asparagus and salad with feta covering half the plate.  When I asked the waitress why it wasn't the roasted asparagus with mushrooms and parmesan that we thought we would be getting (listed under appetizers on the regular menu) she indicated it was the other asparagus appetizer.  I pointed out that there was only one asparagus appetizer on the menu.  She searched for it and commented that that was weird.  She finally found an asparagus salad under the salad section of the menu and said that was what the appetizer was.  Very deceptive and at the reduced $6 happy hour price certainly not worth it.  One of my dinner companions ordered the stuffed manicotti and it was swimming in sauce. 
 The manager at this location (blonde, shoulder length hair) is one of the most unwelcoming and rude managers I've ever experienced.  I went in last week to purchase a gift card for a friend around 11:30.  The restaurant was almost empty and this manager was behind the counter.  There was not a hostess at the door or a waitress in the room so I approached the counter and waited for an acknowledgement.  She never once looked at me or greeted me even though she was a few feet away.  Not even a \"someone will be with you in a minute.\" Finally a waitress came from the kitchen area and asked if I had been helped.  She was gracious and friendly (as the wait staff always is) and got the gift card for me.  The manager never did say a word to me.  Tonight my friend arrived before me and waited at the hostess stand to be seated.  The same manager stood at the hostess stand and never spoke to my friend.  My friend finally took a menu and sat on one of the benches inside the door. Eventually a waitress asked my friend if she had been helped and seated her. 
 I will definitely be taking my business elsewhere.  Too many other Italian restaurants to choose from!  Have you tried Fabio on Fire?  You should!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad dish at Babbo. The prices are fair and the staff is nice. It can get very busy at peak times. It is best to go on off nights or off hours to avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"Deal Chicken first time visit, and We Shall Return!  Had the roasted brussel sprouts and beet salad as our appetizer (after discussing it with the very pleasant and attentive server) and if I were to review just it, I'd have to put 6 stars-- in addition to the roasted vegetables, the goat cheese was so creamy and teamed up with the roasted nuts and balsamic dressing so deliciously.  Husband loved his Sicilian pasta. Midway through our dinner, we knew we'd return so asked to see the menu again to scout future meals.  Seems eclectic and and adventurous-- don't know if menu is online, but if you check it, you might be surprised.  Next time I want to have pizza with broccoli.    Mentioned Deal Chicken-- we had to use up our money in one visit, so we had to discuss what else to get (as \"take-out\") to round out our bill and we both thought about another b-sprouts and beet salad, but home is about an hour away from this restaurant.  Just adding that to help you understand how goooood that salad was! So we ordered a kids meatball dish for our grandson -- I'm sure he'll enjoy that a lot more that the microwaved ones he sometimes gets.  Bravo Babbo!"}
{"text":"We had take out and everything was fantastic!  Cajun jambalaya was terrific as well as the classic Alfredo. Bread was hot and fresh!  Salad was on point!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times before and the food and atmosphere is great, but tonight was more than disappointing! We walked in around 6, told it was about a 45min wait. No problem, we thought, and took a seat at the bar. Ordered a couple of drinks and an appetizer.  Drinks come ( happy), 30min. go by, no appetizer, 45, 60.. You get the picture! Turns out they are catering 2 (!) weddings and it's all take out. The only food being brought out is for take-out.. Nobody in the restaurant was getting served!! I have never heard of this happening and think it's really more than a poor excuse for management.. I felt bad for the waiters and bartender, because all they could do is apologize and keep checking the kitchen. We left after an hour and a half and the appetizer never did show up :( ... Wow!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you to all the staff at Babbo Italian Eatery!  The catered meal on Thursday, March 7 was a HIT!!!   On time and just as we ordered.  Both the Mushroom Asparagus pasta and the Pasta Rustico were scraped from the bottom of the pan.  The Spring Mix salad (my personal favorite) and Chopped Chicken salad were enjoyed by my group, and then shared with those who were lucky enough to find a little left. And add it fit into our restricted budget.  I have already been asked to put you on our list of \"keepers\" for future functions."}
{"text":"This cute Italian Eatery just lost my business.  I'm a stickler for service and this place just totally turned me off.  Let me first say, I do enjoy the cuisine at Babbo and have enjoyed dining there frequently.  However, despite how many times you gone there you must be sure to get on their email list. Otherwise you aren't part of the \"Babbo Family\". Somehow I missed the opportunity and perhaps that was my oversight.  Getting to the point... I walk in with an email promotion forwarded to me by a friend offering $25 extra dollars free for every $25 in gift card you buy (up to $100 value). Great promo, I'm thinking...I eat here all the time so why not get one for myself or gift it to someone special.  The hostess asked for my print out but I didn't have it being that the details didn't specify it was required.  Then instead of asking if the email was sent directly to me from Babbo, she takes my phone trying to investigate herself.  Then asks if I'm part of the Babbo Family.  It was a very disrespectful way of making one feel excluded.  In short, the gift card promo needs to be improved if they plan to run again.  Perhaps including in the fine print that it's only valid for the email recipient, those on the Babbo email list (aka part of the prestigious email \"family\").  Also, if printing is necessary, then say so.  I'm in the field of project management inclusive of marketing and feel like this was a failure for a place I once adored. Too bad."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!

Being half Italian - let me say this.... BEST MEATBALLS I HAVE EVER EATEN....

Don't order a meatball sandwich because it comes on flat bread (disappointing). However this is the only thing disappointing about this place. 

Babbo's $5.99 spaghetti & meatball dinner on MON & TUES. You cannot go wrong....

I will be back as usual. I will most likely be there either on a Monday or Tuesday.    :-)"}
{"text":"Everyone will find something that they love here Try it, you will like it. Wonderful  menu  and great service. Great meatballs!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  I had the new Menu item Amy's Lasagna.  It took a little extra to time to get to the table but worth the wait.  Highly recommend this if your looking for good traditional Italian food."}
{"text":"I stopped by there yesterday to pick up a couple of meals to go...
Chipotle Chicken Pasta, Manicotti and their Brussels Sprout Beet Salad and when I got home I couldn't have been happier with the food. It was very tasty, fresh and hot. 
I know where I'll go the next time I want Italian!"}
{"text":"If something isn't broken, why fix it? That's the case. Over the top attempt to make a traditional dish something it isn't. I got the chicken fettuccine and three cheese Mac and cheese. The Mac n cheese hardly had any cheese! More chipotle and sausage than any cheese. The salad and bread was the only good thing. The chicken fettuccine was okay but to many vegetables over power the traditional chicken Alfredo"}
{"text":"Went to Babbo tonight for dinner and our server Michelle was GREAT!!!! Ask for Michelle you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Babbo's late on a Friday.  Our waiter was very friendly, and we were seated right away.  I ordered a cold app and unfortunately had to wait 15 mins for it to arrive.  For our entrees, the Alfredo supremo,and the goat cheese personal pizza, the were superb.  What fantastic flavor! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why everybody seems to like this place.

We went late Tuesday afternoon and had their spaghetti and meatball special.  The service was pretty lame.  There wasn't enough spaghetti and it was swimming in way too much, very acidic sauce.  The meatballs were good, though.

What really gets me, however, is upscale Scottsdale prices in what is really a neighborhood bistro.

In summary, way overpriced for not really great food."}
{"text":"I think the picture I posted sums up my experience at Babbo. 45 minute wait for this \"stunning\" appetizer."}
{"text":"We just found this place! Love their pizza and salad... Fire roasted red peppers and sausage and Matthew was our very nice and very cute waiter!! Gonna try Happy Hour next time...2 pizza, 2 salad and 2 wines for $25!!"}
{"text":"We haven't been here in quite a while, and were treated to great service as well as delicious entrees, including the Chicken Fettuccine and the 'Chalkboard' Roasted Chicken Wild Marsala Mushroom. We love the bread, too. We highly recommend this eatery."}
{"text":"Wow, what a nice surprise.  My choice of meal the first time I try an Italian restaurant is spaghetti and meatballs.  If a restaurant can't do that right then I won't go back.  Babbo's did it up really well. The sauce had a really fresh flavor with a good touch of basil.  The meatballs were very flavorful and they were big. I'll be back for that meal again.  When we walked in we were greeted promptly and taken to our table.  Our server, Scott, was right there for us and followed up on things all through our meal.  The only thing I'm sorry about is that I waited so long to try this place.  I'll be back soon.

As I said, I would be back soon.  Last Friday evening I went there with a special friend and my grandchildren.  We were seated immediately and our waitress came right away for drink orders.  The drinks came fast and we ordered our meals.  The meals came fast and the server was very attentive. This was a great night out, everything was perfect.."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and the food was delicious, not your typical Olive Garden food. Service was a bit slow but overall I would go back, the fresh bread is amazing!!"}
{"text":"As out of town visitors we were very impressed with the food and service at the Babbo location in Surprise. Even though we had a party of 20 the food arrived correctly and hot. Our server, Will, was on top of it. He was fast and personable and we were impressed."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this location previously and really enjoyed ourselves. Unfortunately this time was horrible. The food was great but service was terrible. To start we stood around the entrance for 10 minutes waiting for someone to acknowledge us. Finally the hostess came up but had an attitude, that did not dissipate through out the night for any other families that came in. Our waiter wasn't much better he forgot the wine we ordered, the bread for the table and only checked on us once it was time to pay the bill. Not sure what management is doing but some training on customer service would be helpful.
We will think twice about going back, as I said the food was great but it's hard to enjoy your night when you can't  even get a glass of wine you ordered"}
{"text":"If you want fast food Italian this isn't the place for you, however if you want fantastic Italian food with great service (especially if you're lucky enough to get Jenna as your server) then you've come to the right place.  

The spicy alfredo with Italian sausage was simply delicious.  The spinach gorgonzola was creamy, decadent and very good.  My son who happens to be quite picky went for the steak panini and said it was one of the best sandwiches he's ever eaten.  

We had a larger party, 7 people, and we had made a reservation for 6:30 on a Friday night.  When we arrived it was obvious that the tables that they normally use for larger parties were occupied and would be for some time.  It didn't take long however and they had made arrangements to move a couple smaller tables together to accommodate our party, a very nice gesture that didn't go unnoticed. 

The food takes time no doubt, but the bread they bring out, as well as the attention they give to making sure that your drinks are full certainly helps with the wait.  When the food does arrive, thinking about how long it took to prepare such deliciousness is the furthest thing from your mind."}
{"text":"Zeb the bar tender is awesome! We maybe come once a month and he remembered my husbands drink of choice! Super friendly and always nice to sit at the bar! Highly recommend because you'll get the best service in the house!"}
{"text":"Good Italian food at reasonable prices. I've been here a few times for take out now...you can't go wrong with the three cheese mac and cheese. I'm a big fan! Also, give the steak firecracker rolls a try...something different and spicy (if you use the dipping sauce). Usually, we'll sit at the bar and have a few beers while waiting for the food and the bartender/waitresses are very friendly and the food doesn't take long. I'm sure I'll be back for take out again, soon!"}
{"text":"This was the first time that we have eaten at Babbo and we opted for take-out. No complaints about the staff they were all nice...but oh my goodness...the food...one word sums it up...blech. We both ordered the chicken marinara sandwiches which we later found out were no longer on the menu at this location...and we decided to split an order of spaghetti and marinara. I asked for some extra marinara sauce for my sandwich...I asked for it on the side as in a small container...it was on my sandwich and it made it too messy to pick up. My first bite nearly made me fall off my chair...the focaccia bread was so salty that the roof of my mouth was burning...and each subsequent bite was the same...I tried scraping it off the bottom but it was too far baked into the bread to do that. Now everyone who knows me knows that I salt salt...that is not a typo...salt is a food group for me...they really over did this spice. The chicken was tough and tasteless. The spaghetti with marinara sauce actually needed some salt...or some taste...it too was awful. We do take-out four or five nights a week and the food is always fine..we never have any complaints no matter what we order...I am watching my husband tidy up and there is a ton of food left...he asked what I wanted him to do with it and I said throw it all out...he normally eats the leftovers but he doesn't want any of it. I have a stomach ache from all of the salt and my mouth still feels weird from it. Why so much salt on bread? I have a heart condition and high blood pressure. I think if people want salt it should be their choice to add it...this was our first and our last visit to Babbo. My husband is more tolerant than I am about bad food...I told him he could probably save all of the chicken that I didn't eat and put it on a sub roll for lunch tomorrow...he said no thanks...and he just remarked that it was about as disappointing a meal as you can get. Wish I could give it a bunch of minus stars. Blech. blech...blech!"}
{"text":"Great place in the extreme east valley with class and ambience. So tired of having to drive to Scottsdale to have real italian food. Though, there are places I would still drive to, we won't mention in this review! I had the personal pizza with mushrooms, pepperoni and suasage with a ceasar salad.  I agree the little plate needs to replaced with a bowl or larger plate, it tends to spill out on to the table no matter how hard you try to keep it on the plate. The pizza tasted like it was from a brick oven it was rustic and tasted great! It was hot and made fresh. And yes the bread they bring to the table is fabulous! I love that bread buttery and garlicy, is that a word? Anyway delish!! They have an array of sandwiches, pastas, pizza and appetizers. I will be back to try more things on the menu. My mom had the spaghetti and meatballs and was pressed to   finish it, she took it home and the waiter wrapped some fresh bread for her to take with her and called her a special person! That got me, she is 82 and loves italian food! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I normally don't have a great experience here but tonight was excellent. The fools was delicious and the service exceeding my expectations. Pizza, salads or whatever you order is great!"}
{"text":"Babbo - please, please, please, pleeeaaase get a hostess who knows what she is doing! My kids and I love this place, great specials on Monday night, but we go there on other days as well....pizza is good, spaghetti and meatballs rock the kids world, salads are presentable and edible...but the calamity at the entrance is disastrous!!! lets work on this Babbo, I'll be back,,,but with two kids in tow, lets keep it legit....you guys do your job and I will do mine!
otherwise I will have to stick with take away"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch deals! 
Waiters are SUPERB!!!!!
food fast, fresh and fantastic!
its a hidden gem!!!"}
{"text":"Consider this a review based on many experiences over an extended period of time, and not a review of just one or two visits. 

We went to this restaurant when it first opened and it seemed pretty good. The good experiences lasted for a few months and then things started going downhill fast. Eventually we just stopped going there. We probably would not have given this place so many chances if it wasn't so close to our home, and our initial experiences had not been good. That was years ago. 

Restaurants are frequently changing due to changes in management and employee turnover, so after extended periods of time, we visited the restaurant again to see if anything had changed. We have done this twice now, and will not be doing it anymore. Our most recent visits were in the last few weeks. The first visit seemed like things had improved, but two more subsequent visits have shown that this place has not changed at all.

The service we experienced was so bad it is hard to comprehend. If our many experiences are anything to go by we think that maybe they don't like it when people come in their restaurant. The bizarre thing is you might think that it has to do with them being busy, but that has not been the case at all. One time it was so ridiculous that we actually sat waiting forever and eventually noticed two of the servers were standing at their podium area just talking, and we made eye contact with them several times. Eventually I got up and walked over to them and asked them if it would be too much to ask if we could get some service and they seemed quite put out that I had interrupted their conversation! On the LAST visit someone actually came to the table after an extensive wait and asked if a waiter had come to the table yet. When I told them no, they said they would see if they could find someone. The restaurant wasn't busy at all and staff were walking around everywhere. Even after this, no waiter ever came and I decided it was time to leave. 

There have also been some serious problems with the food on occasion, and there never seems to be any management around anymore. At this point I wouldn't wish this restaurant on my worst enemy."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I love the bold flavors and combinations. Their dishes set them apart from other Italian places... I felt as if I had robbed them with all the food I received. They have a Family Plan option on the menu. The family plan includes a Large 2 Topping Pizza
Choice of 2 Pastas
Large Mista Salad
Fresh Bread
Slice of Chocolate Tort or cheese cake
  
I know what you are thinking it must have cost a lot.  WRONG The family plan is only $40.00  My pasta choices were the Three Cheese Mac and Cheese and the Spicy Alfredo with Italian Sausage.  Both dishes were like a party on my tongue.  The Three Cheese Mac and Cheese has Smokey Chipotle Cream Sauce blended with Cheddar, Mozzarella and Gorgonzola cheeses. Served with Bacon and Sausage on Penne Pasta. It was so cheesy my children loved it.  The spicy alfredo w/ Italian sausage has Scallions, Tomatoes, Mushrooms, Italian Sausage, in a Creamy Garlic Sauce. Served on Fusilli. This dish had just the right amount of heat to make your taste buds dance. The pizza was had just the amount of sauce, meat, and cheese.  The salad was wonderful. I did not eat in but instead called ahead for carry out. I called the restaurant to enquire about the family deal and the staff was very friendly the order was ready in 20 minutes.   When my husband picked up the food he stated the staff was friendly as well.  When the food arrived home I wondered if it would be cold or spilled out, but they had everything packaged so nicely not one crumb or splat of sauce had even spilled.  The food when I retrieved it from the bag was smoking hot. I had to place it down quickly.  I love my food hot and a lot of times when you carry out by the time you get it home the food is cold or room temperature. This food was piping hot.I have been driving by this place for years and am now kicking myself.  I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"New area so it's super busy; however, they handled the rush very well. The food was great. Try the fried ravioli."}
{"text":"Came after the car show, people waiting which to me is a good sign, worth the wait. We were told 25-35 min wait, which was accurate. Was seated, next to friends of mine. Which was way cool. I ordered Chopped Mediterranean Salad, hubs ordered Amy's Lasagna. Both were really really good. No complaints at all, and the bread..yum! But... Husband had to ask twice for water, and even logged into fb and hit them up on messenger to please come and fill up his water.. seriously (such the jokester) they responded and asked if we'd spoken to a manager, and he said no, and that we weren't coming back again?  At that time, waitress came by, husband asked for check. She came, and he pulled out his card as to hurry to pay and leave.  Not sure if this is from being short staffed, too many tables, or the business only being open for less than a month but this needs to be looked into."}
{"text":"The worst service ever. The owner is a 3!%*# 
And Food came out cold. My suggestion eat elsewhere. Or save your money."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a couple of times because it is close by, but each time I was slightly less pleased than the time before.  Service is inconsistent and inefficient and the host (if that is what he was) was not welcoming.  Only a handful of tables occupied, so it was not busy.  I was served my wine in a glass that you could tell the dishwasher did not get the lipstick prints off from the previous user---that was a disappointment.  Server was nice enough, so I did not complain.  Pasta dish was too oily for me and the sun-dried tomatoes were all clumped in an oily glop in the center, and I wished I had ordered the salad for dinner like I had there a different time as it was much better."}
{"text":"Came here to Babbo again and the second time here was better then the last. Our server was really nice and so happy. Our food was delicious, I had the Jambalaya Chicken and my mom had the spaghetti. Everything was great!!!!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of the now defunct Macaroni Grill. Babbo's phrase, Eat Like an Italian, is a little laughable. Most Italians don't eat like this, but Americans THINK they do. 
I started with a Insalata Mista, which was good - crisp lettuce adorned with mushrooms and other veggies, the dressing was just right. My entree was the Chicken Limone (lemon chicken)... meh. Swimming in butter, under seasoned, with perfect machine cut chicken cubes tossed (?) in fusilli pasta, with three flaccid lemon wheels, artichokes and capers.  This dish could have been outstanding with a little seasoning, fresh lemon, parsley and a dash of cream.
The dishes are not inexpensive, so a little creativity and thinking our of the corporate box would be welcome.
My husband ordered a 10\" pizza with 6 diff toppings - the pizza cost $17. Ouch.
I hear the best two days of the week are Monday & Tuesday bc of the spaghetti & meatballs. No doubt we'll check that out, I just hope there's a little dusting of dried parsley in there somewhere.
Good cocktails, fair wine list.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant at the new location. Was happy to see that the restaurant is much larger and the location can now be seen from the street. 
We had a  small wait time before we were seated but it was crowded and I was glad that business was doing well especially in Surprise.
I think that service could be better.  We ordered only salads and it took quite sometime before we received our order. Our server only came by once to see \"if we were ok\"- not asking if we might like a desert or a refill on wine etc. We were seated in a back booth by the serving station/ kitchen and the whole time we heard the phone ringing. I would suggest that they move the phone directly to the front out of hearing range for customers. I turn my phone off as a courtesy to other guests in the  restaurant and I don't appreciate hearing the restaurant phone.
Overall, I think the food is always consistent and always recommend to our friends."}
{"text":"Husband and I went for a date night. It took over an hour to get our food. Terrible food. Bland. Please, don't waste your money. The only redeeming quality was our server, Mike."}
{"text":"This was my first dinning experience at any Babbos's with my family, I usually get take out for work. Over all, I knew what I was going to expect with the ambience. Very casual and small. My server wasn't very efficient, left empty glasses and other dishes on the table, needed to ask for refills and our food took exceptionally long. Of course, the day that we went at a later time and with the kids. I love the zucchini noodle option but my meal description wasn't what I received, although it was good! My kids meatball sandwich looked Amazing! It was huge! We ordered 2 but only received one, the server must of thought it was best to get one. My husband did not like his Parmesan chicken, he said it was dry and didn't enjoy it. The orange soda cream drink was crazy good! It wasn't a total fail although I won't be going back with my family. We spent over 2 hours, which wasn't a little over kill.  The manager did come over and acknowledge it was taking forever! I'll just stick to getting my food to go."}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times and the food is always good. It's always busy which shows me the food is good. Spaghetti and meatballs is a favorite along with their pizzas. They have a great Happy Hour menu so check it out!!"}
{"text":"Really upset to give this a 1* review because I love going to smaller, less known places. I've eaten at Babbo a few times and have always had pretty good experiences, but my most recent experience has made me NEVER want to go back & make an effort to tell people not to go.

First, we were seated right next to the blazing hot window. Sweat was literally pouring from our faces & we were fanning ourselves with the menus. We asked for a new table but were told it would be 20 minutes to be reseated, even though we watched several people get seated who had just walked in far less than 20 minutes. The manager even came by telling us we were sitting in the \"hot seats\" and that they were sorry that particular window didn't have tinting at the time. Seriously, WHY would you seat someone at a table you actually know is BLAZING hot? We ended up scrunching super close together on the miniscule portion of shade on the table just to get out of the sun. There were no air vents above us so we couldn't feel the air conditioning. We felt like little slaves huddled on what is known as the \"hot\" table while everyone else was relaxing under the air vents & shade. Must be nice to be on that side!

Next, the server was the worst I have experienced, anywhere. We didn't even receive as much as a smile, just muttering asking what we wanted, acting like he was doing us a favor by taking our orders (I should add that although we were upset about the table, we tried to be friendly to the waiter; we know it wasn't his fault we were sitting there & weren't going to take that out on him). It also took us a really long time to get water refills...especially miserable since our table was so hot & we were all out of water.

Now let's get to the food. When the side salads came, there was so much salad stuffed onto a small plate that the salad was literally flopping off of the sides and onto the table. It was also drenched in dressing & the combination of the salad falling off of the plate & swimming in dressing, it looked like the most unappetizing food I've ever seen. Since there was so much salad on the place, it was really hard to eat because most of it was just falling off of the plate & onto the table. When i was done I had to pick up most of the wasted salad & put it back on the plate. I should also add that the salad was a decent size for a side salad; it was just put onto a REALLY small plate.

At this point it was just miserable. Food was falling everywhere, sweat kept dripping, and horrible service that was giving me a headache. We asked the manager to come back yet again and expressed our complaints about the heat & service, but the manager made no offer to make it better. I'm not the type to complain or ever try to get something in return, but I was surprised when our check came & we were charged the full price given the manager knew how upset we were and completely agreed with us about our horrible experience. I guess service is just going downhill, but if I was the manager I would have done everything in my power to turn the situation around and make my customers happy, even if it was as simple as offering us a new table or giving us a small discount on the meal we couldn't possibly enjoy or even want to take the time to eat with sweat dripping from our faces.

Needless to say, the food is decent & I am very sad that their horrible service has ruined my liking of this restaurant. All it would have taken was a nice server or something other than the manger to simply 'agree' with us to completely turn this experience around. I will not support nor recommend this practice of business."}
{"text":"Wow, just had a wonderful lunch today - the Meatball Panino & Pizza are really great. The bread they serve on the side is very delicious also. Nice, casual place with great service.  Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"GREAT!  Have been coming here for years, since they opened, and the quality and service has never changed. (thats a good thing!)  Our favorite thing to get is the Spring Mix Salad and the creamy mushroom, sundried tomatoe, and assparagus pasta.  Very Good!  no matter what you go with, you will not be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first time this past week, and I'd give this place 3.5 stars. 

I got the kale/quinoa salad and it was just okay. It had quite the potential, but seemed like it was missing something... Something else is definitely needed to break up the salad a little bit. 

The spaghetti and meatball plates on special looked pretty good (my fiance and friend both ordered that).

I might come back to try one of the other salads, but would not order the kale/quinoa salad again. 

Service was good. That is all!"}
{"text":"We had a disappointing evening on our wives night out. Sangria tasted like diluted wine vs. wine punch. When we asked to exchange the drinks for something else, the manager on duty rudely greeted our table demanding to know what was wrong with our, \"TERRIBLE\" drinks. Sadly, replacement margaritas were not any better. We started off with the bruschetta trio and were unable to distinguish the different types apart. They all looked and tasted same!!!  We knew we had already upset the staff with our drink fiasco, so we decided to let this slide and hoped that dinner would save the evening. Dinner was good, but our waitress was nowhere to be found for drink refills, or to pay our bill.  We had to flag someone down for both. We tipped her over 20% and left."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other night for a quick bite and loved it.  Bruschetta Trio (did the first 3 on the menu) was great.  Pasta was delicious (Pasta Rustico and Spinach Gorgonzola Pasta). And I don't remember there being a martini list before but the 007 was very good.  Service has caught up to the kitchen making this place my new go to place."}
{"text":"This area is severely lacking in sit down restaurant choices, so this was nice to see a sit down place going into the old Nicks 24/7, especially because it seems to have taken them 1200 years to get this place open...I had actually thought they had pulled out it took so long.

The menu here is large.  The pizzas are yum.  The pastas are nice.  They have this italian sandwich which is absolutely divine!  I just wish the sandwiches had more side choices.  You get a bland pasta salad at lunch or fried zucchini chips at dinner which are nice when fresh, but if left too long before hitting the table they are cold and floppy.  I have found the salads to be hit and miss.  Their tiramisu is totally delish!  And anyone that knows me knows, that if the tiramisu doesn't impress I am hard pressed to come back.

The service here sways between attentive or absent, guess its just the luck of the draw.  The prices are right, and if you sign up for their monthly newsletter you get some pretty nice bargains."}
{"text":"Look bitches, I did not order my wedge salad \"deconstructed\". The wedge is structural, textural, and (the least of my concerns) presentational. It is not just chopped lettuce. Also, if I did get the horseradish ranch, as I requested, it was weak sauce. Creamy pesto pasta? Ugh. Over-cooked noodles and gooey cream sauce with green flecks.

Better than Olive Garden."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to eating at Babbo one evening after seeing a show but was very disappointed. The food was expensive and not very good. staff was rude and not very attentive. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Nice non-chain Italian. Good service and a good food. The restaurant has a good vibe"}
{"text":"I get hungry driving by this place. It is so good!

They start your meal with warm bread and olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I always try to avoid it but it's so tasty. Plus, as I mentioned just being around Babbos makes me drool.  

I try and always get the marinara or maybe bolognese with meatball.  I had a sandwich once that was good too but after trying their sauce once, I can't imagine changing my order.

Beware if you use Discover debit, however. They had no sympathy for me when their system didn't accept it - even though they take Discover credit!"}
{"text":"It's ok. Floor was dirty and our waiter seemed almost clueless. Food was good but not \"write home about\""}
{"text":"Quick service food has its own great taste very nicely surprised"}
{"text":"We had a party of three & ordered a Bianca pizza, a chicken artichoke calzone & a mushroom pepperoni sausage calzone. We shared all 3 dishes & everyone was surprised at how bland the food was. Maybe we came at a bad time? I will give Babbo's another try because service was good & will upgrade my review."}
{"text":"Food was just okay.  I think carrabas and buca di beppo serve better italian food.  It also seems pretty cramped in there.  Will not come back!"}
{"text":"food was great-service is terrible-I wrote the company 2 emails they did not reply   very poor upper management-there are plenty of good restaurants in surprise-no need  to go to this one-unless of course you like waiting at the front receptionist for 15 minutes and the employees ignore you and look at you like you have 2 heads-they do not care about greeting people at the door so I see no reason to give them my $  too many others enjoy my business"}
{"text":"We have eaten at Babbo a few times now and it has been going downhill. The first time we ate here was a few months ago when my father-in-law was visiting. We went in with 4 adults and 3 children. The food was amazing and service was pretty good. I would've given it 5 stars. We went back last month and service okay and food was mediocre. The restaurant wasn't busy. We thought maybe they were just having off night. We decided to try it out again last night. Made it in at about 6pm, and there were only a few tables seated. The host greeted us and asked how many. After I said 4 and a highchair, he grabbed some menus and walked toward a booth. He set the menus down, went to get a highchair, and as he was walking back up he told us \"it's ready for you\" then moved on to the next group of people that came in (he walked everyone else to their tables while we were there). We sat down and waited another 5 or 10 minutes before the waitress came by to take our drink order. Not that it was a super long wait but she walked past us a few times, not busy and never said anything. She returned with drinks and took our food order. We didn't see her again until after someone else brought our food and she asked how it tasted. We said we just got it, but it looked good. And it did look good. However, once we started to eat, we noticed the meatballs from the kids meals and my chicken from parmesan chicken were all very overcooked. My chicken was hard to cut through and the marinara was way too oily. We only saw the waitress 2 more times: once when we had to stop her to ask for a refill and then when she brought us boxes and the check. I don't think any one thing would have made for a bad night, but all of them together just wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"If I could give a 0 star rating and leave a comment I would! Where do I start. Well let me walk you through beginning to end. We walked in and was greeted by a cow chewing her cud. Well that's how hard she was chewing her gum. No it was not the only time I saw her doing do because from our table I could watch her all through the meal. Once seated the young lady who sat us said something incomprehensible and walked off. Then our waitress showed up and asked us if we would like a drink. We ordered our drinks and main courses at the same time. The waitress then left and shorty returned with pizza dough and said the oil and drinks we will be out soon. Next we got drink and asked if we could get salads. We then waited long enough both out glasses were empty for some time. When the meals came out we were surprised because we didn't get salads. Still no drinks. Then a few minutes later here comes the salads. I sent them back because we already had our meal. A minute later here is the same guy with the same salads asking if we were ok with having the salads right? Um as said before no! A few more minutes before our waitress comes to check and apologise for the mix up and offers to take them off the bill and get us a complimentary desert. Still doesn't look at the table enough to see we need drinks. Leaves as fast as she came. Finally we flag her down long enough to ask for a water and soda refill. She comes back with another mixed drink and a soda. Um WATER ?? Still I watch the cow chewing her cud. Once our meals were done we flaggedthe bus boydown for a box and to take the plates. He takes the main course plates but still no one has cleared the bread plate or oil plate since we first sat down! Then the waitress comes out with our check in hand! Not one mention about desert! Don't go to this place it was bad service from start to end. And every single person who talked to us spoke fast and left so fast the single sentence they speak to you each time they appear is trailed off when they turn their backs and are leaving your table. The worst experience dining out I've had in a very long time! Even Mcdonalds gets more things right and better service at the damn drive through window!"}
{"text":"We used the Happy Hour app and found this great gem. We had the most wonderful stuffed portobello mushroom! It had flavorful sausage, ragu sauce, tomatoes with balsamic reduction! FANTASTIC!!! Our top shelf martinis were only $5! The staff was wonderful and very attentive. We ended up ordering a pizza just for the sausage!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten there many times.  I often get the pasta with the Martini Sauce but substitute spaghetti for the Penne.  It is delicious.  I have tried most everything on the menu and have never been disappointed.  The service has always been friendly, helpful and quick.  One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Went there for the First time felt Like having some Spaghetti and meatballs I mean they should get that right huh?
Well we ordered the bruschetta trio and they came out the bread was all wrong it was sliced bread and it was limp and tasteless why do they try to signature a basic staple dish just serve it traditional and leave it alone then to the main coarse 
No Angel hair they did have spaghettini??
Was told it was a cross between reg spag and Angel hair w t h???? Well it still had the boiling water in the dish around 1/4 cup of it and the meatballs were COLD
Why??? On my kitchen The meatballs are within the sauce (right)?The waiter was mortified we assured him he was not the problem we paid for our drinks and gave him the price of the check as a tip they really DROPPED the meatball on this one kitchen really screwed up ooh and there was one guy that kept coming out and eyeballing us they may have had a better result if they had been eyeballing the quality of their product"}
{"text":"Where do you begin... service is awful. Awful. No one is assigned to your table. Food is so-so. Won't be back for sure. Need to ask for a place setting. Order was incorrect and was told they'd get another one out... nothing. Took it to go. Ugh... McDonalds actually may be better... unfortunately.

Son ordered spaghetti marinara... came out penne marinara. They said a new one would be brought out - never did. Had to remind and take it to go. Packed in a paper bag it leaked all over and fell out in front of restaurant. Had to remake it again and brought it in a plastic bag. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but I asked for meat sauce instead of marinara and the up charge was $5, a little pricey.  Also added sausage and that was an up charge of $5, do the Mon-Tue Special ended up at $17.  Not sure I would do that again."}
{"text":"Used to eat here often when I worked in the area and it was consistently good.  Today we stopped for ouch with friends and it didn't disappoint.  Great food and Alexis did a good job serving answering any questions.  Highly recommend   Always satisfied with service and food.  Reasonable prices and has a nice happy hour as well. Enjoy.  Bon appetite"}
{"text":"This was the most terrible experience I've ever had at any restaurant. 
My husband wanted to stay in for the evening, so we decided to get take out. I had never been to Babbo, so we thought we'd try it. I got the stuffed manicotti, which I could hardly finish because the texture and taste was so odd. It all makes sense now, considering I went to bed shortly after and woke up abruptly a few hours later violently sick. I went to the ER the next day thinking I had the flu or something, but they said it was definitely food poisoning. That meal was the only thing I had eaten that day. I was in the hospital for hours getting an IV and various medications for the nausea that was causing such severe dehydration and was told not to go back to work for a few days. I couldn't even sit up or stand without getting sick for DAYS. I called Babbo later that day to let them know what happened. I spoke to one of the managers who said she would forward the info to their GM and follow up with me. I called the next day because I hadn't heard from her. I told her I have hospital bills and I'm missing work and I still haven't even been reimbursed for my food. She was extremely rude and said she didn't have any information and nobody else had called saying they got sick from the food but that she'd get in touch with the GM that night or the following day and follow up. That was about 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard anything. I missed 3 days of work, I have $1500 in hospital bills, and I STILL payed $40 for our meal and it hasn't been reimbursed. I have never been that sick in my life and I definitely will not be going back or recommending anyone else to. 
I am only giving Babbo 1 star because I can't give it 0. They might have left a slightly less awful taste in my mouth had they handled this situation differently. If you're looking for food in the city of Surprise, go ANYWHERE but here!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the finest Italian restaurants I have experienced!!!
A complimentary vinegar and oil bread dip wets your appetite while you select from an extensive menu. 
Try this place-- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Been going to this restaurant for years and had the worst service ever tonight. Took hour and 20 mins to get our food after our order. Complained to manager. Assured us they were doing best they could do. Got bill and not a single discount for the horrible service. Won't be back. Not sure what happened to the service here."}
{"text":"Awful service. Waited over an hour to get the food. Appetizer and salad never came. Waitress was not friendly. Only came back to the table to confirm if we got another drink \"so I can make sure that I charge you.\" Kids meal came after adults were served. Never coming back for poor service."}
{"text":"Had takeout from here earlier this week.  Although my order was called in ahead of time it was not ready when I went to pick it up because they had run out of bread?  Seriously, an Italian Restaurant running out of bread?  That aside the food was excellent.  I had the Jambalaya and it was very good.  It's spicy so be ready for that!  My kids had the spaghetti and meatballs and like it and my wife liked her dinner too although I don't remember what she ordered (oops).  The infamous bread that I waited for was worth the wait though, hot and fresh and went well with the garlic spread that was free because I checked in on 4Square when I got there.  We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I am or was a regular every week. They are so inconsistent with the salads. One time you actually get a large and the next time it is less than a small however you pay for the large. They make excuses for the lack of competence. This time it was, \"we have a new salad guy.\"
The romaine lettuce in my salad was all green leafy stuff. There was not any of the good part of the lettuce at all so it was bitter.
I am really fed up! Their salads are not cheap either so at least give me what I pay for."}
{"text":"My sister dragged me here with the kids but to mu surprise everything was awesome!!!!
The valducci pasta with chicken was amazing.. it had olives artichoke hearts with penne pasta and a creamy tomato sauce!
Mmmmm my mouth is waterin wishing I kept some fr lunch today.
The service was very good.. we had 4 kis with us so that's no easy task, server was all over the bread and drink refills... 
Thank you I will be cming back!"}
{"text":"This is for the portion size in question. Is the take-out larger than the in house because today the in house it was a lot smaller size that I received today.
I know yeah yeah yeah minimum wage hike, big whoopie doo but not for me.
What is the saddest part is I asked for extra sauce it seems like I got watery sauce instead  Like Ragu from a jar you know \"Ketchup / Water\". Missing the thick stuff you can pickup with a knife and spread it on the bread. 
Bad move cutting the corners we like the corners!
Bad move.."}
{"text":"Babbo is probably your best bet when looking for a good sit down Italian establishment on the east side.  The first time I drove past it, I was thrown by the name, and wondered if I would ever eat there. Then after reading reviews on yelp, I took my girlfriend there for the first time. We drank (awesome) dark ale pints from the tap, and had the bruschetta trio to start, then both ordered pasta dishes. Both were awesome - full of delicious flavor and neither of us had any complaints. The decor is modern, and classy - but still feels comfortable ; like I don't need to dress up or pay a huge bill at the end of the evening. With three beers between us, two entrees and a appetizer I think we spend a little over $50. In my opinion, for the experience and food that is a great deal.  This second time we went in, they were not as busy - and I had the spicy Alfredo. It had a bit too much spice, but I love spicy food.  For an appetizer we had the pesto bruschetta. The pizza we ordered (Roma) was delicious, and light on the pallet.  She had the steak and pesto pasta and seemed to enjoy it as well. Again, out the door for around $55, with three delicious entrees and an appetizer & drinks. Not bad, and we both enjoy the place so I'm sure we will be back again and maybe make ourselves regulars if things remain consistent. 

I take away one star because the wait staff knowing we were a young couple enjoying a romantic evening placed screaming kids a couple of booths down with seating open everywhere. Made a reservation the first time for two without problems, but the second time they told me they would only make reservations for four or more.  Also one star because you have to pack your own leftovers - that should be the staffs' job, not mine - for that is indicative of a lower class establishment."}
{"text":"Pretty interesting concept of a comfort semi-fast Italian food.

Nice, small, comfortable setting, clean and with good friendly service.

I had the portobello mushroom menu with a salad (mista) and the mushroom topping.

Everything was good and at a decent price.

Mental note: Next time ask them to use less EVOO in my dish.

Cheers"}
{"text":"I had never eaten at Babbos and I met several friends here for dinner. I started with a Mojito and it was the BEST Mojito I have ever had! The bartender, Chrissy did a great job! My friends had Margaritas and said those were wonderful as well. The warm breadsticks with oil was a great start to the meal. (I could have just eaten those). I had Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and it was very good. Our waiter, Philip, was fantastic. I will definitely be coming back. They have a nice Happy Hour menu for food and drinks that lasts until 6pm."}
{"text":"Food and service are just OK.  I didn't give them 2 stars because you might like it.  I would rate this place just below Olive Garden."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite neighborhood restaurant. Their roasted brussels sprouts and beet salad is devine and the pizzas are amazing. Service is always great as well"}
{"text":"We stop in every now and then. The food is consistently good with a variety of tasty dishes. With Carrabas and Olive garden as the only other Italian eateries in Surprise, this is the go to place, when my inner Guido calls out for Chicken Fettuccine or a calzone. My son loves the kids size pizza pocket (Its ten times the size of a normal one he points out)."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for a midweek dinner. Tuesday they do a special on spaghetti and meatballs. There's nothing better than the bread and oil/vinegar though! Staff is very friendly and the minimal issues I've had have been immediately addressed. Wish the location was bigger as sometimes it does get very crowded. Overall, great establishment!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner with family and friends and we were seated immediately with our reservations. We ordered the Chicken Chipotle Pasta and the Spicy Alfredo Pasta. The chicken chipotle pasta was just okay, I felt like something was missing from it. Wasn't bad, but wasn't very good. The Spicy Alfredo Pasta has a nice kick to it but was very good. The bread and the dip you get was soooooo delicious. I will say it's super small inside and it feels like all of the tables are really close together. The service was great and we were in and out within an hour. They have a huge menu with a variety of options so I will be back to try something new."}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a week and order things for the entire office as well. Prices are very fair and the food is amazing. I've tried just about everything on the menu and I have yet to be disappointed. Defiantly our local favorite!"}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a week and order things for the entire office as well. Prices are very fair and the food is amazing. I've tried just about everything on the menu and I have yet to be disappointed. Defiantly our local favorite!"}
{"text":"Babbo plates consistently good dishes at a reasonable price. For my wife and me the service has been quick and attentive. Luncheon specials and coupons make for a great deal too. Keep in mind this is a neighborhood joint in a strip mall, not a 5 star restaurant. That being said, I would absolutely recommend Babbo to anyone and will definitely return myself."}
{"text":"The quality of the food was disgraceful.  Let me paint this picture for you.  Imagine you are rummaging through a dumpster of an Italian restaurant in order to compile a meal not even fit for your dog and that is what you get here. Only two customers were in the restaurant and it took nearly an hour to get our food... A pizza...  This place is the worst"}
{"text":"Always great! Never had anything I didn't like from here. Pasta rustico is one of my favorites there."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Babbo's for years now, so i finally decided to try it out. My husband and I took his Mother and family for Mother's Day, but were somewhat disappointed. While the bread that was initially brought to our table was great and the service was decent,  the entrees themselves were lacking. My husband had some type of a steak salad, but described it as tasting like a philly cheese steak sandwich heated on top of a bed of lettuce. I had the wedge salad which was alright but way over priced. We ended leaving with a bill over $100 and not satisfied with our food. This is a restaurant that we will definitely not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Best Italian in Arrowhead!
I only rate places that get 5 stars..."}
{"text":"Good solid pasta and meatballs, especially for $5.99 on Monday's and Tuesday.  Service was great and the waitress was warm and friendly.  If your looking for a decent place with a nice atmosphere and a great pasta special, be sure to try Bobbo's"}
{"text":"Great Italian food and fast service. I had jambalaya with chicken and shrimp. Very tasty and lots of flavors , they also gave us free breads with olive oil which is delicious. Firecrackers rolls are great ."}
{"text":"Perfectly reasonable Italian chain restaurant.

I've eaten here many times, and everything that I've had has been good. I haven't had or seen anything that was surprising or particularly special; but the food is consistent.

The waitstaff is friendly and accommodating.

There always seems to be a wait for a table, and there are very few chairs for waiting. It can be pretty brutal in the summer - standing around outside. Hopefully the new location (opening in October 2016) will remedy this. 

A step up from the Olive Garden, but still a chain. I would rate it four stars \"for what it is\". The three-star rating reflects my personal experience compared to other Italian places, including independent- and interesting - restaurants."}
{"text":"This is a comfortable neighborhood restaurant, suitable for families.  As a first time visitor, I tried the spaghetti and meatballs.  The portion was large enough to take home a leftover.  I especially enjoyed the homemade bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping.  The spaghetti sauce  was above average and the flavor of the meatballs complimented the spaghetti.  I finished the rest of the meal at home several hours later, and it tasted even better after sitting in a refrigerator. The tiramisu was somewhat of a disappointment, served in a large coffee cup with some type of sweet cream on top.  I would not call this tiramisu a classic."}
{"text":"A very diverse and authentic Italian menu..
The staff is very friendly and helpful with choices."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple times the past 2 weeks and I will continue to.  Their lunch special is well priced for the amount of food you get. I love their Spinach Gargonzol!  Their bread is one of the best I have had in my opinion.  Lots of things to choose from as well.  You should try it out!"}
{"text":"Totally impressed with the spaghetti and meatballs. The bread is so good I couldn't stop eating it. And what impresses me the most was the bill. I went on a Monday night for their special and my bill was like 7.00. It was excellent food and the special made it my new favorite Monday night eatery. Service was great. Love this place you should check out their spaghetti or try the wedge with the warm bacon and horseradish ranch.....awesome."}
{"text":"Not such a good experience!  Stopped to get my father that is in the hospital food and the gal at the bar was less than pleasant.  Never had some one bring me my food, check or change for that matter and not say can I get you anything else or thank you.  One would assume when you place a to go order that they would include silverware and you wouldn't have to make sure it was in the bag."}
{"text":"Honestly, I think Babbo's deserves 3 1/2 stars for the food, but a solid 4 stars for their Monday-Tuesday night $5.99 spaghetti dinner!  Not that the spaghetti is great, it is good, and the 2 large meatballs are very good.  The stars are for an affordable, filling, relatively heathy meal that the entire family can enjoy.  The breadsticks and olive oil/balsamic vinegar are very good and we have had excellent service every time we have gone.  It has nice ambiance inside the restaurant and additional, comfortable seating outside."}
{"text":"I went a couple of times for their spaghetti special. Very disappointing. Noodles and sauce were very watery, and bland.

Bob"}
{"text":"It was really good food but the service last thursday was not great and could be improved.  Would give it another shot cause the kids really liked the food, but the service needs to be much better next time, forgotten orders, waited 15 minutes for bill, and the salad was really bad..."}
{"text":"I'm mad at myself for never reviewing this place. We've been coming here for years and have always received amazing service. Always. It's clean. Always. The food is on point. Always. I wish I could name a few servers but really everyone is wonderful."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. If you are in the mood for some creamy, tasty pasta, this is the place. Sorry Olive Garden, I think you've been replaced. We started with the artichoke shrimp & crab dip. It was served warm with a side of their home made bread slices. Delicious! I ordered the creamy garlic chicken penne. It was full of flavor! The pieces of chicken were not big like in most places. They almost diced the chicken so every bite of pasta had some in it. The portions are big! Probably big enough to share one dish. I had plenty leftover for lunch the next day! Actually everyone had leftovers! My husband ordered the bacon & green bean pasta with mushrooms. Again full of flavor. The bacon gave it an extra added taste. He enjoyed it and he normally never orders pasta. Another great dish that was ordered was the creamy pesto with chicken. Omg. My niece said \"You should ordered the creamy pesto. You're gonna love it.\" I didn't. But I had some of hers and let me just say. Omg. Next time I will definitely order it! I loved Babbo and I don't know why it took us so long to visit this place! We're definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"I am surprised to see all of the negative reviews for Babbo.

I have not had a bad experience with the service. I've been to Babbo at least 20 times and have never had to wait long. The bread and olive oil is delicious and the servers are usually pretty good about keeping it coming.

The food is good, but I have only had the pastas, calzones and salads. I have not had the pizza. Most of the sauces aren't particularly overwhelming as far as the use of spices go. Even the \"spicy\" dishes aren't going to knock your socks off. However, everything has been well cooked and conistent each time I have visited (no over/unde-cooked pasta, nothing to bland, etc). They'd benefit from adding some variety to their menu and having some lighter options. 

Prices are reasonable and it is a nice change of pace from the other Italian joints."}
{"text":"Local restaurant with great prices!  The husband likes the calzones and I have enjoyed an array of different salads.  The service is friendly and always happy to make recommendations.  This was definitely a happy little find for a good lunch."}
{"text":"Whitney was a very friendly waitress. I ordered the Argentinian Rosé at $8.50 which was oxidized. It was replaced, however it arrived when I was almost finished my meal, pity. On the bill I was charged $6.00 for the Rosé, so I presume that it was not replaced by the same one.
I ordered Manicotti stuffed with Ricotta. I chose Italian Sausage instead of Portabella in the Mixed Pepper Ragu. It was very filling.
When I ordered my main course, I noticed that they had a Special on Mondays & Tuesdays so I ordered Spaghetti & Meatballs to go for $6.99. It felt as if they were short staffed tonight in the dining room. 
In the dining room, I saw an adult man lick his plate, when he thought no one was looking so I suppose that his dish was tasty!"}
{"text":"This is supposed to be fast casual there was no fast about it it took a while to get seated at least 10 minutes for the server to come outside she didn't greet us first things out of her mouth was what are you ordering we would like to order no my name is know what would you like to drink straight to what do you want to order seem like she was in a hurry to leave or something and just her poor attitude never smiled once now for the food they start out with their bread basket which is just cold red name heated up I hate that I can't remember the name of the dish I had but a pesto and cream I do believe it was pretty much flavorless didn't have that bold pesto flavor maybe too much cream didn't care for it all the only saving grace was the cheesecake it was pretty damn good not overly sweet really creamy as you said before this is not a fast casual place to me we are there probably an hour hour and 20 minutes you should have been out there in no more than 40 minutes it was more the server taking forever to come out and check on us or do anything for this I would never go back to this location again may try another one but never know"}
{"text":"This place is probably the closet Italian restaurant to where I live. The service has been good for all the times when I have gone there. Always welcoming, friendly, and available.

However the food is just 3 stars. It's not very authentic, which is fine. I'm in Mesa not Italy. But even so, it is particularly good."}
{"text":"My husband and I are celebrating our anniversary here and we wait 45+ mins to get our food just for my husband to not get what he ordered. Our waitress hasn't come to check up on us and now we're waiting AGAIN. The service at this location is absolutely embarrassing."}
{"text":"I love this little neighborhood place!!  Food is really yummy, staff is nice and super efficient.

My favorite part is one of the chefs there - he's adorable and is always smiling. Its nice to see that people enjoy what they do."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time visiting Babbo. Last night's service was TERRIBLE. It took our waitress 25 mins to bring our drinks and 45 minutes to bring 1 appetizer! Mind you, we sat down at 830 at night when the restaurant was slowing down. The waitress didn't seem interested in serving us as at all and it was almost like we were an inconvenience to her. The only reason i would give last night's experience 1 star is because the fried ravioli with sausage ragu was delicious. My fiance's dinner looked like it has been under a heat lamp for 30 minutes and it tasted ABSOLUTELY GROSS. For someone who never, ever complains, she had to send it back. My calzone was burnt beyond recognition. 

Anyone looking for an \"authentic\" Italian restaurant, please look elsewhere as the food and service is disgusting. You couldn't pay me to frequent this place again!"}
{"text":"Nice family atmosphere. Kids liked the Italian sodas. We liked the full service bar. This is our favorite meatball and pizza joint. Service was excellent. Thanks Rafael!"}
{"text":"Food not worth price. Convenient yet still wouldn't go back. Only thing decent is the free bread!"}
{"text":"For the meatball special the meatballs themselves are excellent, but the sauce is very plain and has next to no taste to it.

Overall the food is a little bit better than average, but if you go for lunch good luck to you if you get the guy server Andrew.  He does not understand at all what service is all about as my last trip there in a mostly empty restaurant and he knew I wanted my check he let me sit there and watch him wipe the bar down and talk to his coworkers before he finally got around to me. He also does not check back with you after your food has been delivered to you. And as long as we are talking about the guys in there the other one who is I think supposed to be the manager on Mondays I have never once seen him walk around to a table and ask people how their food is as all he did on my last visit was sit over on the side at one of the booths and do nothing for most of the whole time that I was there. 

My rating would be higher if I had gone on a day when I had one of the ladies as a server. The ladies on the other hand seem to provide pretty good service during the lunch time hours as that is when I normally go there."}
{"text":"I don't complain. Plan and simple. I've never complained about service, or anything related before.

First off... we were seated in the \"sunny seats\". We were told it was the only seat. Whatever... didn't care too much. Not too big of a deal. It was 113* today, and you could for sure feel the heat off the window. When the manager walked by, she apologized for the hot seats and explained that they should have a tinted window like the rest of the restaurant in no time. OK... so don't you think that the table maybe shouldn't be there?

Anyway.

WORST SERVER EVER. Yes, we were seated in the sunny seats. 4-6 waiters walked by us several times. I asked the hostess for water when we were sat (I'm not exaggerating how hot it was) and it took at least 5-6 minutes to get some water on the table. Our server brought the water, with no straws and simply walked away. Every single person in my party downed their water in under 5 minutes and I was never ONCE refilled my entire visit. After placing our order, the waiter was so rude & I was so hot... I asked the hostess to  make mine to go. 

When the manager walked by a second time we let her know how rude and short the waiter was. She observed him rudely taking our order & walked back to us and said: \"I'm sorry. He's usually really good. I don't know what's up with him tonight\". Are you freaking kidding me? His service never got better and the MANAGER did NOTHING to make it right. She even walked my to go box over to the table herself.  Here's what she needs to do right: fire him. There's plenty jobless people who would do a heck of a job compared to him. But however, after more explanation below, staff members who are bad are a reflection of a bad manager. 

She was fully aware how upset we were. We left, with not too much tip. There was no way I'd give that man a dime. 

I thought about how awful this was on the way home & decided to call once I was home. I spoke with the manager and she knew who I was. She apologized about \"hot sunny table\" & I explained my thoughts on how that ONE table should not be used. All it's going to do tomorrow is make someone else mad. Most of all, I said the table would have been NO big deal if we had a human being as a waiter. She agreed, apologized and said she was \"going to give us a free dessert but it was just so busy she didn't get to it in time before we left\". Guess what... didn't want dessert... it would have melted & we wanted to get the heck out! She offered me a free salad for my next visit. I nicely told her there was NO WAY I was going to return. I asked for her to return the money on my credit card and she said there was no way they could do that. I then said that I'd gladly drive the 15 minutes back to have my card refunded, that evening when I got around to it. 

I'm so upset nothing was done the first time we informed the manager that something wasn't right. What's odd is she agreed with us the whole time and STILL did nothing about it. Never switched waiters, never gave free drinks, NEVER REFILLED EMPTY WATER glasses, just didn't do anything. Due to this experience, I'll be contacting the owner with my experience. NEVER ever have I written a negative review on ANYTHING in my life, until this. 

Needless to say I'm very sad about this. I love their food, I think it's the best Italian on the west side. Unfortunately I don't think I can ever go back, not until some new management whips it into shape."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain, but boy is it good! From the moment you sit down and they bring you this incredible warm, seasoned bread with olive oil and balsamic for dipping you're hooked. I had the Mozza-Balls and a Mini Wedge salad and after devouring the bread, I no room for pasta. Next time for sure. Their menu is expressive. Can't wait to bring my husband here!"}
{"text":"Kid friendly Italian restaurant. Large menu which is good for a wide variety of eaters.
Service was EXTREMELY slow and unapologetic. Undecided as to whether we will spend time on another visit."}
{"text":"Food was ok. EXCEPT I ordered a caprese salad or something like one and everything but the tomato was fresh...a canned tomato...seriously guys...theres a sprouts right there within walking distance."}
{"text":"Great service and best bang for the buck. Three different orders, all with good reviews. Definitely try."}
{"text":"We got seated in the corner booth.  The waiter brought a small plate of bread and another tiny plate of oil &vinegar.  No napkins.  For this size table it would have been nice to double this because we had to stand up and reach across the table to get to the olive oil. 

Waiter then brought our drinks but forgot straws.  Food was average at best - you can get much better quality and service at other places.  Side salads came in a tiny plate that you could not eat it without having lettuce spill over.

Did not see any managers walking the restaurant.  A lot of small improvements could be done that would make a difference.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood favorite of mine. Great lunch and dinner selections.  Service is always very friendly and quick. Take out is quick and easy also!  Love Babbo's food!!"}
{"text":"The wife and I wandered in here for a quick bite and was pleasantly surprised!  The staff was great and the food was fantastic!  As I said we were stopping in for a \"quick\" bite but after seeing the menu would decided to make it our supper, we ordered appetizers and meals, leaving there pleasantly plump and a new spot found to frequent!!"}
{"text":"How the hell do you order a dish composed of chicken and vegetables, and end up finding accidental pasta underneath?...as a gluten intolerant person, im annoyed. And is honesty not the first time ive had issues with them and now decide, i am done. If I didnt know any better, id believe they cook gluten free pasta in the same water as the rest of the pastas. Highly disappointed. Place sucks."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a nice salad and had a super dining experience.  Emma was a super bartender/server. Drinks were spot on good, pistachio appetizer was delicious as was my salad.  Fresh baked bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar is awesome. You can also get it with garlic butter yum."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad but the horrible customer service from the manager makes it not worth it.  There are several Italian restaurants in the area that deliver great food and great service so I see no reason to return to this establishment again.  They apparently don't need or want my business."}
{"text":"Cute place. Our first time here.  They start out by giving you fresh bread and olive oil w/balsamic vinegar for dipping.  Yum!  Rob had a bacon and pepperoni pizza,  had a meatball calzone.  Very good, light and fresh.  The place had a consistent flow of customers, which to me says something.  We defiantly will go back."}
{"text":"I am a huge advocate of if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all, but ... 

Absolutely disappointing first time experience - hostess was less polite, the waitress was worse than the hostess, the manager was on the phone while vacuuming next to our table while we waited for our waitress to come to the table .. 

My fork was caked with the previous customers meal .. 15 minutes for drink orders another 15 minutes for our order to be taken .. 20 minutes later the food arrives and the Alfredo Supremo was so over seasoned with pepper that it could not be eaten by my daughters 

We have family / friends who have raved about the Babbo experience and needless to say I am leaving here completely disappointed and probably won't return 

... Oh the 20% discount for a meal that was not edible was not a reasonable solution"}
{"text":"Service was poor.   The food was not good.   I got the roasted chx and marsala with mushrooms.   Horrible my children and husband ordered a pizza, they said it was good so that made me feel a little bit better since I paid 70.00 for lunch.  But within a half hour they were all complaining that their stomachs Hurt, and didn't feel good. I will never go back.  Definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Special Thank-you to the entire staff from managers Ryan and Erica the cooks, waiters, waitresses, bartenders, busboys...I am not an easy customer-I know, special orders-every time, take-outs that are very customized. I am a problem customer for sure, however, you all know my name as well as my little service dog Dolly, treat me like I matter and always get these pain in the butt orders perfect! Thank-you for the awesome food you prepare as well as being so darn nice. Sooo, you all deserve more than the 5 stars I can give."}
{"text":"We used to love this place...don't know what happened. Went a few months ago and got bad service and mediocre food. Wanted to give them another chance since we like to support local businesses. Walked in tonight to find no hostess yet 3 or 4 people working there saw us standing waiting to be seated. When seated no server so we got up and left. Won't be coming back that's for sure!"}
{"text":"We love Babbo's.  We've been going since they've opened.  We usually get a salad, bread, and an entree to share.  We get out under $20 most times (depending on the entree).  This place is cheaper and way better than Olive Garden.  Service has always been excellent.  Out of the 100 times we've been there only had a problem once and they handled it very professionally-and it was no big deal.  If you want average Italian fare at a good price with nice people this is your place.  They do take out too which is nice when you are too tired to eat in.  They also have a nice patio to dine on when weather permits."}
{"text":"First time here. Start out with the bread and vinegar and oil, very tasty. Next had the brushchetta trio, Bread is good, cheese had no flavor , needed more peppers. Would not get again. Wife had brussel sprouts pasta, she liked it. I had a meatball sandwich, which was very good. Overall I will go back.  Service was great."}
{"text":"I love Babbo! This is our favorite neighborhood restaurant. It is located at the end of the Fry's shopping center. My husband and I love the free bread! I love the Garlic Shrimp Pasta and my husband is always trying new things he loves the pastas, pizzas, and hot sandwiches."}
{"text":"I really like this place. They have great Italian food and the quality is the same regardless if you eat there or get it to go. Their Brussel sprout salad is AMAZING and their fresh bread is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Not the worst ever, but not very good either. Food was fair, service was marginal. Even Olive Garden would have been more satisfying -- which should describe the level of disappointment at this place."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now, every time it's been on a Monday (Monday is one of my days off from work so that might be the reason). So with a $5 spaghetti special I thought I would try it, now it's the only thing I get. The funny thing is that I'm not a fan of spaghetti at all (the first time I had it someone had got it for me to go, manly because they were cheap). Served with fresh bread, you could make it two meals. Do yourself a favor and try this place or the spaghetti if you haven't. I might try something else someday if I'm not here on a Sunday or Monday."}
{"text":"I like Babbo when I'm craving pasta. They have a relatively vast menu with pizza, salads, and other things as well, but I always go for the pasta. It's delicious. Perfect when you're craving comfort food. The Spinach Gorgonzola is rich and creamy, and just a little tart, as you would expect a cream sauce made with gorgonzola to be. The Fresh Tomato Mozzarella is one of my favorites; it is lighter than the thick cream sauces if you're not in the mood for that. My husband loves their spaghetti and meatballs. We've always had good service too. If you're craving pasta, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I really do not understand the hype of this place. I had a pasta dish and the noodles were not cooked through. The \"fresh\" mozzarella was not melted when it arrived at the table and was obviously pre-shredded Kraft cheese. I added on shrimp for 5 dollars, which I received 5 in my whole plate and barely bigger than a quarter. My wife ordered pasta also, the Alfredo had no flavor, and the linguini was clumped together and the middles not cooked through. I felt completely ripped off and will not be returning. I should have known something was up when you order your food and it arrived 5 minutes after the server leaves. If you want better Italian go to Carrabba's, sad that a chain beats a small Italian joint."}
{"text":"The food was great and we really enjoyed our meal but what I'm really grateful for is how helpful our server was. He made many insightful suggestions on the menu and was really attentive. Can't say enough good stuff about our service. The guy was awesome. We were grateful."}
{"text":"First of all no one sat us for about 5 minutes with no acknowledgement.  Today I had the chicken protein bowl.
The chicken was processed  spongy chicken.   Truly disappointed in Babbo."}
{"text":"I came here a little ago with a couple of friends, and I really liked it! For some reason, I am pretty picky about Italian food to the point that in the rarely choose Italian restaurants or order pasta dishes. I guess I'm easily disappointed and prefer to make it myself (no I am not Italian, or a chef). I tried an asparagus and mushroom based pasta dish and I was impressed! It was absolutely delicious. I wouldn't compare it to the truly authentic dishes that I've had and loved elsewhere, but it didn't taste bland, generic, or microwaved. I was inspired to make a similar dish later that week. My friends loved their food as well (pasta), we all ate the majority of our meals. The bread served is also very good, and our service was great. I would definitely go back, and recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Babbo is a cute little Italian restaurant at 67th ave. and the 101.  

I always have gone there with a coupon, so have no complaints about the price.  They also have a great happy hour deal (I think 5-7 p.m.) - $25 for 2 glasses of wine, 2 small salads, and 2 pizzas or pastas.  More than enough food for 2 people, plus you get their delicious bread!  

Their pastas are ok, but their pizzas are delicious!  We had their caprese pizza on our last outing- pesto sauce, mozarella, and tomatoes.  Yum.

Service is a little slow, hence the four stars.  Otherwise, I'd give it 5."}
{"text":"We ordered three different pasta dishes.  All were pretty good.  We would come back if we were locals."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS! My Wife and I have eaten here many times, but today we ordered a pizza. I kid you not, this was one of the best! We ordered a 16\" pepperoni, black olive, and fresh garlic, ' I know stinky breath ', but good \". First of all, I have never seen shredded pepperoni, It was awesome. Now for the crust, so fresh & moist, it literally melts in your mouth. Great food along with great staff is why Babbo's has been one of our favorite's for many years, and is the reason we keep coming back. We love this place."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth a second trip. Dirty and bad service. The bread was great, but that was it. The salads looked wilted and were overdressed. The pasta was nothing to rave about - actually a bit overcooked. And was served way to fast - not even half way through our salads. So probably ended up under a heat lamp. Certainly would not recommend to anyone. 2 stars for the bread."}
{"text":"I had a really lovely lunch. My server, Carlos, was fantastic! I had just come from having blood work done. He noticed and got me 2 waters right away and the bread. I kinda ordered a large lunch with the intention of taking half home. I got the lunch special of pasta and salad and the bruschetta trio. I ordered the spinach Gorgonzola with chicken and the pomodoro tomato salad. I chose the pear walnut, prosciutto with fig and arugula and spicy fig gam with goat cheese from the list of options of bruschetta. The bruschetta was so good!! Very indulgent. The bread was not hard and fluffy and huge! The salad went down in 3 bites. I had 1 bite of the pasta and it was delicious. I got the pasta to go and even got a water to go as well. Well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Yummm..........You must try the chicken chipotle pasta. The service here is great. All the servers we have ever had have been beyond helpful. Stay away on Monday and Tuesday unless you dont mind a wait."}
{"text":"Our experience at Babbo has been generally positive. Good Italian (ok Americanized Italian) food at reasonable prices. This review is directed at management and owners.  We came in tonight (a Thursday) for dinner at the bar. Took 10 minutes to get a bar seat; a table for two was going to take 45 minutes. It took another 10 minutes for the lone bartender to get to us and another 10 minutes to get a glass of wine and a margarita.  Ten minutes later we were able to order.  More than 20 minutes later we did not have our appetizer.  It came at about the 30 minute mark.  At the 60 minute mark we did not have our food and no assurance that it would be coming soon.  Eventually we gave up, paid our bill and left.

Two things are important here. First, the staff was working incredibly hard. There was only one bartender.  There should have been at least two.  The lone bartender worked very hard to serve bar customers and the restaurant as a whole, but he had no support. Second, the manager on duty explained to us that they were sharing staff with a newly opened restaurant. This was a serious error.  They should have opened the new restaurant with a soft opening rather than handicapping an existing good store. 

We will return and give Babbo another chance, but not for awhile."}
{"text":"Very Good place to eat. 
Stopped by on their first night open.  
Love the pepperoni pizza and how the pepperonis are chopped up in small slices.  A very nice departure from the normal circular peps 
My wife's gluten free pasta was spot on.  

Wish this family that owns this restaurant only the best!   Job well done"}
{"text":"We went in before work so time was limited. They put the wrong order in by accident. The manager came right over and told us they would remake the order but in the meantime I could eat the mac n cheese that was made in error. It was delicious! We took the other one to go and they even took it off the bill. I was very impressed with how they handled this on a busy Friday sept 4th. Food was awesome, service stellar! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our first time dining at Babbo's. I saw them in the news doing a charity event for Phoenix Children's Hospital. 
After looking at the online menu my wife and I went for dinner. 
Great service and wonderful food. Perfect portions. No room for dessert. Next time we will plan for a dessert. 
Babbo Italian Eatery will become one of our regular stops!"}
{"text":"The new Babbo on Ray & Rural is very clean and a little on the swanky side. Very nice ambiance. Service was excellent. Our waitress was awesome. The bread was tasty. But our food was just ok. Not sure if I will go back since both meals were just mediocre. And, I don't understand why Babbo puts the salad on such a small plate that it spills over the side. If you aren't too picky & you love all Italiain food this might be worth a try."}
{"text":"The staff and management at this location go above and beyond to assure a great customer experience, making guests want to come back.
Not only is the staff amazing, but the food is to die for. Always hot and fresh at the table. My favorite is the Chicken Protein Bowl. A healthy dish with mixed vegetables, brown rice, quinoia and a spicy honey glaze. I could eat one every day, hands down. Oh, and don't forget about the delicious bread with an olive oil and balsmic vinegar dip, too good."}
{"text":"Came in here today for my wedding tasting through our venue. Everything was wonderful! The decor is so nice and intimate and our waiter was wonderful! The pasta is delicious, it was so hard to decide what to pick! The appetizers were also wonderful :) I'm excited to have them cater our wedding!!"}
{"text":"yup--- this place rocks
Monday and Tuesday night special cant be beat in this area.
staff and service is great, on line order is easy and food is great!"}
{"text":"I've yet to eat IN the restaurant, only have had take out.  I tried, the order on line special, and placed a time when I would pick it up.  It was ready more than a half hour before I picked it up, unfortunately everything was cold.  I wrote the mgmt., who took care of the issue in a prompt, courteous manner.  I was very impressed with how they handled everything.  I plan on going back again, and again, and again.  The food is awesome, the salads wonderful!  Thank you Babbo's!!  They are very service oriented!"}
{"text":"I  have never been disappointed their food is delicious good quality and huge portions,  thou have to try the Mac n cheese, by far the best dish on their menu!"}
{"text":"Definitely worthy of 5 stars. Good service, quick seating, and the food was UNBELIEVABLE! Got the spicy sausage pasta and the garlic shrimp linguine. I've never had better pasta anywhere else honestly. Simply incredible. Don't think about it. Just go"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely spectacular. The meatball special on Monday and Tuesdays is amazing. The marinara sauce is one that I will order every time. I think it is the spice that kicks it up a notch. The calzone is crusty and puffs up."}
{"text":"Trying out Babbo for the very first time and was hoping that the trip was not a waste.  I did check Yelp reviews prior to going but you know how it is--sometimes they're right and sometimes they're wrong.  
We were served sliced foccacia bread along with a dipping sauce made from an olive oil/balsamic vinegar mix.  I felt too much balsamic for the olive oil, but gave it a whirl.  But first I added black pepper, hot pepper flakes and a little salt.  Not bad, but I hate having to \"cook\" when I go out to dinner.  The foccacia and dipping sauce was quite nice.  But, but, but.... why is it that they never give you small plates so you can put your own bread on it and you don't drip olive oil from the table to your mouth??  So I asked Morgan, our server, if they have bread plates.  She says, \"Sure\" AND THEN she comes back with ONE plate (there are two of us ! Morgan).  
Hubby's entree comes with a salad. He chose, \"MISTA\" or something like that.  Small salad but delicious.  Mixed greens with golden raisins, onion and PINE NUTS.... I love PINE NUTS.  It was topped with gorgonzola cheese and a sweet balsamic-type dressing.  Really good.  I stole some from hubby so I know.  
Entrees arrive:  Spaghetii and meatballs for me and a \"chalkboard\" menu item which included chicken, marsala wine, mushrooms accompanied by veggies.  No pasta.  Pasta was $6 extra.  Really?On a $13 entree?  not even a teeny tiny bit of pasta on his plate!
Now why,you ask, did I order spaghetti and meatballs.   BECAUSE IN AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT THIS DISH TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW--that's why.   If you can't make a meatball you are DONE in an italian restaurant.  If you can't make a good SAUCE you are DONE as well.  So here it is:  the italian meatball was really, really, really good.  A little on the salty side but good enough for me because I like my food with a little saltiness.  That's just me.  The mix of spices in the meatball was great--sometimes restaurants put in too much oregano.  Not here.  It was a good mix of spices.  And now for the sauce... The question is whether this sauce could stand up to my own.  Yes, my dear readers, I make a killer sauce --the mother of all sauces; the \"capo di tutti capo\", the cat's meow; the slurpiest sauce around!  Let me put it to you this way, if I accidentally dropped my marinara sauce on my kitchen floor, hubby would say, \"skip the mop... I'll lap it up\".   No, really, it's that good.  With that, I am going to tell you that the sauce met my standards.  It was pretty good.  Better than mine.? No.  But remember this is a commercial establishment, they don't do the love thing that I do with the sauce. (Please do not let your imaginations wander).   So not to digress any further, the spaghetti and meatballs was a dish I would order again.  Hubby's dish, while he said it was good, was served on a smallish oval plate that made it look like a nothing portion.  PLUS, and this is important to the restaurant management:  The chicken along with the mushrooms looked like ALPO (the dog food) had been placed on the plate.  Now, keep in mind that he tasted it and liked it--the chicken, the mushrooms, the marsala wine and the sautéed veggies--He liked it all.  Do you think I was going to mention to him that it looked like an Alpo special??  Restaurants are supposed to make dishes ,at least, look a little pretty.  Even I do so at home.  There was no parsley garnish, nothing.  I make chicken fricassee at home and it doesn't look like mush.  Yes, mush.  That's the word I was looking for.  The mushrooms made it look like mush. Hubby said he would order it again so he liked it.  Management could you work on making this dish look more professional?  My spaghetti and meatballs was nice looking--a little parsley sprinkled atop of two beautiful Mount Vesuvious meatballs; beautiful red sauce.  Nice.  So after all is said and done I am giving this place 4 stars.  Morgan, you were a great server and very patient with us on ordering (it was our first time here) .  We forgive you for bringing just ONE bread plate.  Head on out to Babbo's.  You'll have a good meal for a good price in a family oriented setting."}
{"text":"This place has remained pretty high on my list of places to eat so here's an updated review.  It has a very large amount of pasta choices that can mostly all be made vegetarian which is pretty great. Taking people here from out of town seems to make everyone happy which is always nice. The service has always been quick and extremely nice here.  Even if they are a bit busy it isn't a very long wait to get severed and drink refills.  The break they give you with your meal is fresh and not the  overly loaded with garlic butter variety.  it's still bread, but it seems a bit better than most Italian places.  They have a great lunch option where you get pasta and a salad. It's quick and much better than fast food.

Try:

- Pasta Rustica
- Pasta Valducci"}
{"text":"Wow
Much better than the old location
Expanded menu 
Service was great and sat at the nice bar
Wife's pasta dish was excellent 
Pizza was top notch"}
{"text":"Yay! I finally got over to Babbo. I didn't know it existed until I read other positive reviews, and it did not disappoint! 

It was a random hour - 3pm this afternoon, and we weren't sure what to eat. So we stopped in and checked out the menu.  Definitely reasonably priced, so we stuck around. My dining partner ordered the creamy pasta with mushrooms, asparagus, and chicken. I had the Italiano sandwich. Salami and italian meats with oil, vinegar, provolone, lettuce, tomato, and pepperonccini. I also had an arnold palmer, which the waitress accidentally made with passion fruit iced tea rather than regular - and it was amazing. My sandwich came with the fried zucchini chips and at that point I was pretty certain I had died and gone to zucchini heaven. Worth the trip alone. I ate all of them.

Friend and I traded bites, her pasta was very tasty. The starter bread and oil they brought out was good. My other half of sandwich came home with me. Only complaint is that the staff was a little over-zealous, but we were the only people in the joint, so I guess I can't blame them. They were probably bored. Good stuff!!"}
{"text":"cute place and nice outside seating (rather new).  however, they have no wifi?  WHAT?  very disappointed.  bread was fantastic and HH specials were good  wish it was a bit past 6pm though."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch with my wife and ordered the 12\" pizza, garlic and meatball. Not the worst i ever had, but sure brought it to mind! Very dry, no oil, marinara or other lubricant... sort of like a piece of cardboard with some very dark brown meatball (about 1/8\" thick) sliced on it. Flavor not even passable, we ate only half of it and brought the rest home (for whatever reason) and promptly threw it away. Iced tea was $2.75 each, total bill close to $20. Won't eat here again, at least won't order the pizza! When we questioned the waiter, he answered that they had just changed the ingredients, was sorry but no comp or discount. $20 wasted."}
{"text":"Last weekend we were in the Phoenix area visiting and on our first night there, the mother-in-law wanted Italian. Came across this restaurant located within a strip mall next to a Safeway. Waited about 30 minutes mind you the hostess quoted 5. Okay whatever. 

First off, I'd like to let servers here know that most patrons are NOT going to be ready to order drinks when they are just sitting down. As in I just placed my purse down and she was already hovering around asking us for our drink order. Really? And she looked really puzzled when we said we hadn't looked at their drink menu offerings yet like we were supposed to know their wine list already. Sorry, I am not from the area and have never been so I'd like to read what wines are available and not be rushed so sorry, you're gonna need to come back in a few. 

Pastas are so-so. I'm sure I could have whipped up something similar at home. I think I might even chosen Olive Garden's pasta dishes over theirs. I also didn't care for their Napoletana pizzas either. I am a huge fan of Naples style pies and we have some of the BEST ones here in San Francisco but theirs did not cut it as they lacked a certain crust that is a standard on all good Napoletana pizzas. The pizza we had that night tasted more like regular, Americanized, thin crusted pizzas. 

The zeppoles were quite tasty but they they doused our plate with way too much whipped cream.

Towards the end, service was better and and our server was nice and prompt. I really wanted to enjoy this place but as far as our overall experience the 2 star \"Meh. I've experienced better\" rating rings true."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try this place out but worked all day and just thought I'd pick it up to go. Called it in and was told 30 min, no problem I thought. WRONG! Show up 30 min later and was told my food was ready but the bread was not and it would be a few minutes. 10 minutes go by still no bread. This is while I watched table after table get served bread with their entrees and for bruschetta. I was then told it would be just 2 more minutes. After 5 more minutes I got up and grabbed my food off the counter and walked out with no bread. Don't forget my food sat in a bag for over 15 minutes in plane site. Got out to the car and  called my fiancé and asked her to start the oven so we could make frozen garlic bread at home. Got home and finally tried the food. Sub par at best. Pasta tasted like thick chow mein noodles and the marinara sauce was laughable. Not to mention my fiancé was sick all the next day with stomach issues. I reached out to them that same night for a resolution as I try to give places a second chance but they have not even bothered to even acknowledge me. Save your time and money and go elsewhere. This place is a joke!"}
{"text":"We had them cater our wedding.. the food was great but they showed up late... we had our cocktail hour without appetizers for 3/4 of it and what they did bring was not nearly enough ... we only had 50 people at the wedding and they ran out after 1 round ... when dinner was served we found out that they brought items that we did not order and what we did order they failed to bring.... again the food was great and no one knew it wasn't what we ordered but still... we talked to them and they said to call manager the next day... the manager said they brought enough and argued that they brought the correct items and he was looking at the contract ... we brought him our contract which was different and he then back peddled and gave us a gift card for dinner.... would not use them or suggest them for your wedding"}
{"text":"Went here because it was new, looked good, heard good things. Also was curious as to how to pronounce the name. (It's Bab-Oh) Anyways, food was good. Service was good. Atmosphere was good. Only giving it 3 stars because for what it was, it was pretty dang overpriced. Good food though."}
{"text":"I though the food here was good, but not great.  The bread, oil, and balsamic they bring to you before dinner was actually my favorite part.  For my meal I ordered portobello mushroom with mushroom marsala.  While it was good, it wasn't really like a traditional marsala sauce which was what I was hoping for.  Overall, I thought this place was decent and I would definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"The bread they give you is so soft and warm. Amazing. Can't wait to come here again everything was delicious. I came in a big group and we all loved our pastas. I had the chipotle chicken pasta and it was packed with flavor and delicious. I added some crushed red pepper flakes and it gave it even more of a kick. We started out with the firecracker rolls (all three flavors) but the only one I liked was the steak one. Service was great and the prices were reasonable. Their menu is good for everyone, there is truly something for everybody! Definitely will be back next time I'm in Arizona"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant a few years ago and I loved it! This time not so much! First i called to check on a food allergy and talked to a female manager that was very rude and cold. I liked the food the last time so I overlooked her attitude.  Went there hoping for the experience I had 2 years ago. Wow was I disappointed so much! Sat on patio and had no idea that we would be so ignored and dismissed. I was willing to be patient with that hoping it would get better but no luck. We were ignored for about 5-10 minutes then finally a server took our drink order and then waited another 10 minutes to get them.  Ordered food in what I thought was a good manner but then waited another 20-26 minutes for delivery. My dads order was forgotten and my pasta was also not what I ordered. By the time he and I got our food our party had finished their food since we did not want them to wait for our food to arrive. My food was not what I expected or wanted and 2 others did not like their food either. Was very disappointed this time and had such a bad experience that I will never go back. I come to AZ only once in awhile and really was looking forward to this meal with family. Too bad it was so awful. Also they were not that busy being a Sunday football day so not sure why they could not get it together, but they did comp the meals they messed up but still ruined our family dinner. So sad this place went to crap. Will never go back to this restaurant. Plenty of other places to go!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, good service and delicious food. I love their spinach Gorgonzola pasta and bruschetta a."}
{"text":"went for lunch here today with Rand H. we both had the spaghetti and meatball special that you have to know about before you get there because its not on the menu or any signage. Well it was ok , nothing to write home about Rand thought it was a generous portion but I could have eaten two easily. So i will just say a-ok and give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Food and service was really good. Portions were solid and was able to to home left overs. The bread brought out before dinner was delicious. Just don't order a mixed alcoholic drink. Spent $8.00 for a very small Captain and Sprite. But overall I would go back and recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a different restaurant going in besides the regular chain types since I live within walking distance and there isn't much diversity in dining in the area.  I walked over for lunch one day and took a seat at the bar.  I decided to try a lunch special of pizza and salad as this seemed to be the most economical option.  First I ordered an Ice Tea and remarked about the cheesy plastic Coca-Cola drink ware (to me it just didn't fit the atmosphere) flippantly the bartender says, \"well that's what we always have used and no one else has a problem with it\".  As for the food it's nothing special, bland and uninspiring.  Basic salad and the pizza was mostly bread short on toppings.  I thought I would go back for another try but haven't felt the urge.  The Snowbirds seem to love the place so we'll if Babbo's can survive the summer without them, the locals don't seem to be impressed."}
{"text":"Close to my house. Great food service and prices!"}
{"text":"Love the meatballs special (why did you raise the price?!) for easy weekday takeout. Menu is creative and delicious-we haven't been disappointed yet. Not too family friendly but great date spot."}
{"text":"Babbo's is a great little neighborhood Italian restaurant. I like it because it is casual and the food is consistently good. I'm a big fan of their salads: chopped, brussels sprouts, buffalo chicken...they are all amazing! Their pasta dishes are really good too. They also have great bread with rosemary and onion that they serve with all the take out orders and fresh with balsamic and olive oil for dine in customers. Everything is tasty and worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Very good food, nice atmosphere, especially for being in a strip mall. Will definitely go back. We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast. The only problem, that was really our problem not theirs, is that they separated the bills but added 20% tip and failed to tell us that. They received a lot of money that night from all of us since no one caught it. They need to let you know that even if they split checks, any party of 6 or more will be automatically added tip. My husband got the speg & meatballs and I ate lighter with just the grilled asparagus which was also served with a delicious side salad. Wow. Bread was great, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the last time I went I was with my mother for a special girls day out and when we arrived we were seated and then several parties after us were seated and 30 minutes later no one had come by for drink orders or even to drop off water and all of the other tables that had been seated after us had been served drinks and had their orders taken. After trying to gain the attention of the wait staff who seemed intent on flirting with each other instead of paying attention, my mother and I walked out and went to a different establishment for instant seating and drinks. At Babbo we had not even received a glass of water! Shameful on them."}
{"text":"$5.99 Monday spaghetti.  The food is pretty good, but expect a crowd.  Service is OK, and not consistent."}
{"text":"Not bad but the sauce is WAY too salty. I first tried the lasagna and then came back today for the manicotti. Too bad. It looks like they use great ingredients. I wish they'd just learn how to make sauce."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!  Amazing quality and portions and the staff is always excellent and friendly, and fast.  Went there for my mom's birthday and the waiter got her dessert.   The fresh bread and oil/balsamic is amazing.  My personal favs:  The asparagus salad.  OMG, it is sooooo freaking good..  and my favorite entree is the Roasted green bean and mushroom pasta.  Its got tons of mushrooms and bacon and a really flavorful Alfredo.  I dont think they have anything bad on the menu!  Like I said, they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"I did carry out for my first try of this restaurant. Was not impressed at all, mostly noodles and no flavor. Just my opinion. I will try going and eating in to see if it is better."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for a while now.  Finally did abd it was beyond worth it! So delicious.  I had the brussle sprout pasta dish. So fill of flavor.  Bc of the butter type sauce it did pool a bit of grease, but was still so yum. Hubby had his go to chicken parma. He said it was great chicken sauce was same as anywhere else. Service was good. I can't wait to return and try other dishes."}
{"text":"My family of 4 visited Babbo on a Monday evening primarily to try the Spaghetti and Meatball Dinner Special for $5.99. Babbo is located in a strip mall on the SW corner of Tatum and Cave Creek Rd. From the outside Babbo doesn't have much curb appeal, but when you walk in it's much nicer.

After the server took our drink order she brought over some bread that was cut into small strips and was accompanied with a small plate with olive oil and balsamic. We ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and also the Mista salad which includes mixed greens, tomatoes, olives, mushrooms, pepperoncini, mozzarella, Parmesan cheese tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette.

I enjoyed the salad but the spaghetti was swimming in way too much sauce. The meatball was also good. Overall the food was good especially if you are only paying $5.99.

I am knocking off a couple of stars because Babbo didn't wow me. The service was also lacking as our waiter only visited out table twice throughout the entire dinner, once to take my order and once to bring me my bill. Our drinks were never refilled and she made a big deal about my 3 year old kids splitting the meal. I don't mind if I have to pay an additional fee to split a dish but this was never offered. She made it sound like she was doing me a favor because everyone had to have a plate in front of them or she would get in trouble.....it was kinda weird."}
{"text":"Great food...reasonably priced...friendly service. A little slow on the ticket time. If you are staying at the Hilton that is nearby this is the place for dinner without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"We were driving around the Chandler mall area looking for an Italian restaurant. When we saw Babbo's Italian Eatery in the parking lot, we decided we would stop by to check it out. We were greeted and seated promptly after walking in. We were given bread and a olive oil / balsamic vinegar dip to snack on while we waited for our meal, which we really enjoyed. The bread was hot & soft and really just good, so of course, our expectations for the food was rising.

I ordered the Chicken Chipotle Pasta which from the menu sounded really delicious ... A blend of roasted chicken, corn, scallions, peppers, etc. When I got the plate and started eating, I was a little bit deflated. It was almost like the chipotle sauce had an overpowering smokey flavor that, after a few bites, it started becoming way too overwhelming to eat. Needless to say, I went back to eating the bread between bites of pasta (and asked for more) so of course I was carb-loaded by the end of the night! My date ordered the $5.99 spaghetti and meatball special and in fact, we noticed a lot of the patrons around us had also ordered the same. He enjoyed his meal. I didn't try it so I don't have much to say about that.

The restaurant was pretty crowded but we received good service throughout the night. I'm not sure whether or not we'll return ... still undecided. On the one hand, you could definitely tell that they were trying to do something different so you didn't feel like you were eating at a chain restaurant such as Olive Garden. However, on the other hand, everything was just ok."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good.  The consistency between the restaurants here is really good.  I tend to get the same dish because it is really good.  This was my first time at this location.  The service I felt was a bit slow.  I was there around 2 ish and it was probably a down time.  The food was good and the bread was yummy.  I like the food and recommend it."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Today something was way off.  I am a believer though that if you go to a place long enough you will have a bad meal or service.   I felt the service was way slower this time than previous times.  The food took probably around 25 minutes to get to my table too.  I got here at around 1040 ish and waited in my car in the parking lot.  I went in at 10:55.  It was early and they could not have been set up yet either. 

I normally get the alfredo with Italian sausage.  That is my favourite dish here.  Today it was just off.  The pasta seem different.  It seem to be really sticky.  The sauce was way thicker than normal too. It was alright, but every other time I have eaten this dish I clean the plate off.  Today I did not.  The server asked if I wanted a box.  That was because there was some left. Not the same today.

I did ask the waiter how much longer and they could have rushed it too.  I did have to get to the office also.

Like I said above. Sometimes things do not work out.  That is the nature of things.  I will be back again.  I have a lot of good meals and service here.  I will not let this one visit change that."}
{"text":"The Italian food here is very good! My favorite is the lasagna which has a rich flavor and is always fresh. It does take a little longer but it is worth the wait. The alfredo supreme has a nice creamy garlic sauce that hits the spot. As far as appetizers, try the Mazzo Balls! 

Now a lot of restaurants can make lasagna and alfredo but what happens when everything goes wrong? I placed an order to go and it happened to walk out with the wrong customer. I was really impressed by how the staff handled this as it was a pretty big mistake! This seemed to be a once in a a blue moon occurrence and great customer service will keep me coming back again and again!

The sign of a great restaurant isn't exactly in how good the food is but how they handle their mistakes!"}
{"text":"Visiting from NC... the shrimp...& crab dip was Amazing and the bread was hot & fresh and good.  The lasagne took a while to come out but was also tasty. The calzone however was different the bread baked to a crisp bubble and I was not impressed.  Lots of cheeses but spinach and chicken was skimpy. Lacked seasonings.   My friend had the mini wedge and it was fresh and loaded with toppings! 

The service was friendly but slow and almost absent.  Think out waitress was just overwhelmed.  Other waiters and waitresses were very attentive to their customers. So I didn't take this out on my rating."}
{"text":"I had some out of town friends come and visit me. We didn't want Mexican food because they been eating that most of there trip. So I heard about this Italian place and we when there for lunch. I figure it was worth a try. They have a large menu and the food here is really good. We got seated right away but the place is not big. Prices are good and so are the portions."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. The food was very good, reasonably priced, and great service. I will definitely return. Good for kids that are young and \"active\"."}
{"text":"Great place for a family meal. Great variety on the menu, and out large family tried a variety from the menu. Everyone, without exception was delighted with their meal.

Service was friendly and everything arrived at the appropriate time.

Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"So I have heard good things about this place from my coworker and decided to try it out. I ordered take out and ordered Alfredo supremo with chicken. When I opened the lid, there was hardly any pasta and was covered with chicken. I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager asking him if this was a normal dinner portion since I have never been there, and he replied \"yes it's normal, all our pastas are pre-portioned.\" I was very disappointed before I had even taken a bite of the food. If I had known that it was that small, I would have gone to Olive Garden and gotten double the portion for cheaper prize. 

The food ended up being good, but it was a tease."}
{"text":"Glad I finally checked this place out!  The bread was fresh and delicious. I got the garlic shrimp and it was amazing. I'll get this again!  Didn't have any room for dessert but I'll get some next time!  Place was clean and service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in Phoenix I make sure I get my pasta fix here. The pesto pasta is to die for. The servings are perfect too!"}
{"text":"Tried Babbo tonight, the food was tasty, but I would have preferred that my Alfredo be a bit creamier. It was a bit dry, but still tasted delicious. I think the prices are OK, especially for what you get. I most likely will go back to this restaurant and try a few other things on their menu. Overall, the food is good. If you're looking for a causal Italian eatery, this place has what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Visually appealing decor, very clean, comfortable indoor and outdoor seating, nice for groups. The dishes are good, but a tad overpriced for what you're getting. Our last two visits we experienced rude staff. One visit we were greeted by management who seemed annoyed and very disinterested in being there. (Should've left, then.) Second visit our waitress was rude and provided terrible customer service. It's as though they feel a sense of entitlement. Both visits the restaurant was almost empty, so they weren't stressed because they were busy. Very different experience than received at Babbo's 16th St. location where the employees and management seem lovely."}
{"text":"My father had always told me, if there are a lot of older folks. Then you're at a good place. Lemme tell you. There's A LOT of older people at this place. That should tell you how good it is. Also the bread is literally like crack. It's so good. Although the bathrooms could use some toilet paper and soap it's very good."}
{"text":"Food is great but service is horrible. Arrived at 6:15 seated in about 15 minutes. Order taken promptly however, we have now been waiting over 40 minutes and counting for our order. Appears As though we should have called one in. They are getting served a lot faster."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food. I came in the door thinking it would be just another chain Italian restaurant with horrible food but I walked away thinking that I will definitely come back to try some other dishes. Not amazing but very good. and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great service, great food,lots of family quality time, and our server Kyle was amazing HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"}
{"text":"Food is always good. Servers are usually pretty good as well. I love the bread they serve before the meal. I believe it's a garlic rosemary red onion. Whatever it is, It's delish dipped in the olive oil concoction.  They had a delicious hummus at one time that I always would get to go with more bread,  it was so good I'm not sure why they took it off but they should bring it back.  
All in all good food. Oh and they have spaghetti and meatball special Mondays and Tuesdays.  Every now and the they have other specials and their gift card deal they offer a couple of times a year is amazing!"}
{"text":"I seriously love the food here, their Southwest Chicken Pasta is amazing. I'm highly disappointed in the service here. The staff is too preoccupied with talking amongst each other rather than taking care of the guests. Our waitress, she didn't bother to tell us her name, never checked on us after we got our order until it was time to bring the check. I couldn't get a drink refill or anything because she was nowhere to be found. It isn't like the restaurant was insanely busy either.. it was 7:45 on a Wednesday night. I probably won't return to this location. I'll go to the Queen Creek one instead."}
{"text":"I had a chance to eat at Babbo with a couple of old friends from high school last night and it was very enjoyable!  We met up at 5:30; the place was packed but my savvy friends were waiting at the bar.with wine glasses in hand and names on the list .  We were seated promptly and commenced to catching up. While looking st the menu.

Contrary to what previous helpers have said, service was attentive and pacing was good.  Friend 1 had penne with vodka sauce, friend 2 had pasta with a lovely cream sauce, and I had spaghetti and meatballs   All dishes were pronounced tasty and portions were large enough to take home leftovers .

I rarely eat pasta but I can happily recommend Babbo for pricing,  service, and palate-pleasing.  Everything was yummy and our party spent less than 25 dollars each including wine and tip.

Babbo is a place worth trying!"}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food with multi-cultural twists. Come in on Sunday or Monday for extra delicious pastas made personally by Chef Vic. I personally recommend  the Chipotle pasta or the Wild mushroom Chicken Marsala chalkboard dish. If you see a Fedora in the kitchen you will know your food is going to be delicious!"}
{"text":"Came to Babbo today with my girlfriend for a lunch date.  I have never been, but have heard good things about the place.  They do offer lunch specials, but I craved something a little different than what they had on their lunch menu and ordered the 'Creamy Garlic Chicken Pasta'.  Instant hit!  The sauce was delicious, the penne pasta cooked perfectly and there was an abundance of chicken.  I thoroughly enjoyed my dish.  

Babbo is approximately a 20 minute drive from where I live and it is worth it.  I look forward to trying their other dishes."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Italien food I have eaten in Arizona so far. I am from Germany and we have very good Italien restaurants there. 
Took us about 3 years to find a good Italien place. 
It's a bit on the expensive side but at least you get amazing food. 3 cheese mac and cheese is one of my favorites and so is the Pasta Martini."}
{"text":"Tried Babbo last night for date night and it was super!   The bread that comes before your meal is really delicious.  I ordered the chicken limone and added the asparagus ($2.50).  The pasta was cooked to perfection, wasn't too oily and I thought I got a good portion of asparagus that was added.  I, however, was totally out dinnered by my husband that ordered a make your own calzone.  This thing was massive and impressive!  He filled it with sausage, mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes.  DELISH!  Just the right amount of cheese and their marinara sauce (that comes on the side for dipping) is outstanding.  We will be back and I will be ordering something with red sauce!   Service was good and it looked like they had an awesome happy hour menu. I wish I had room for dessert as that menu also looked good!  This place hits a home run for family's, date nights or just hanging out with friends.  Really laid back and chill atmosphere, but still sophisticated.  They also had a really nice patio area, complete with bubbling fountain, which I'm sure will be awesome after we are below 150 degrees!"}
{"text":"Ate at this location twice first time was just ok...and my second time I got food poising"}
{"text":"Edited review - our first experience was a nightmare. We literally didn't go back for a full year. Went back and now it's one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"4.7/5 Best all around italian food in Phoenix, good prices, good happy hour, huge portions. Reccomend the Sicilian Ragu if you like meat!"}
{"text":"Bread...enough said. Okay, you probably want more info. The Pasta Puglia is fantastic and The Italiano sandwich is too. I haven't had a calzone yet but they look amazing. My wife loves the mista salad. The spaghetti and meatballs on Monday and Tuesday's are a great deal and are amazing!"}
{"text":"Have to say I was a little disappointed in my meal. This was the first time I had eaten there and we went for lunch. The waiter was very friendly and you could tell they weren't busy. We ordered from the chalk board menu and what was brought to us was beautiful. The chicken with both of our dishes was so very dry and over cooked. We asked them if possible they could make us each another breast. The manager brought it out and was not very kind when he delivered our \"juicy chicken\". It to was also dry and not appetizing.  We were told by our waiter that the chicken is boiled and then baked in the oven. So I don't think I will be back anytime soon. Very sorry to say that as it was a cute and very trendy place."}
{"text":"The service is spot on as usual from the servers. The hostesses however could really use some work. After being told that it would be a 35 minute wait we started seeing big parties that came in after us being seated. When I went to question what was going on, the girls claimed that they called us and we didn't respond, mind you we were right outside the door and we heard the person that was in line before us get called, but then they skipped over us saying we were a no-show. We frequent this place because the spaghetti and meatballs deal on Monday is outstanding, but it almost makes me want to reconsider if we are going to get skipped over because the teenagers running the hostess stand aren't going to pay attention."}
{"text":"Babbo Italian Eatery is truly one of my favorite restaurants in Surprise, and not because it's close to home. I've been here about 10 times so far and I've never had a bad meal.

They have a nice bar, but my husband and I usually get a table. I've had the house Cabernet, the Chanti, and the Zinfandel. They're all delicious. The Caesar salad is always good and the bread is amazing. I mean seriously. This is ridiculously good bread. And I'm one of those gluten-free folks, but I'll eat the hell out of that bread!

My favorite thing to get is the Couples Special for $25 - 2 entrees, 2 salads & 2 glasses of wine. It's so awesome. I've tried the Pasta Rustica, the Creamy Mushroom and Asparagus Pasta, Spaghetti Bolognese, and the Pasta Puglia. All were outstanding. The only thing that I've ordered that I wouldn't get again is the Chicken Asparagus Fra Diablo. It was decent enough but not as good as the other stuff I've tried. It wasn't bad, just not very Italian-y. 

If you go on Monday or Tuesday night, the spaghetti and meatballs are on special for $5.99. Bargain! Sure, anybody can make spaghetti and meatballs, but these guys have really raised the bar. Give it a try. You're welcome.

There are so many delicious dishes to choose from, I'm sure you'll find something to love. Don't forget to save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"My husband and I Ordered two different salads for lunch, both of them very creative and excellent!   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Long time customer, mostly take-out.  Had a horrible experience the last time and went home and drafted an e-mail to the GM as listed on their website.  Never received an email or call back.  I then filled out their on-line comment form via their website with my same issues.  Still no response!  Not sure how they think that is customer service but I would never recommend a business of any kind who can't even respond to a customer complaint!  Not worth it! See photos of how I received my food after the hostess dropped it in the process of putting it in a bag."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten at this location almost weekly since they opened. The food is great and the service has been very good throughout our visits. In fact, as regulars, we have gotten to know many of the servers on a more personal level and they are really good folks. In fact, I gotta run... We are headed to Babbo's for lunch!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Definitely beats Olive Garden any day. Excellent food and excellent service and we fully intend to come back regularly!"}
{"text":"We are currently here now. Reservations were for 6:00. It's my daughters 13th birthday. We didn't get seated until 6:25. Didn't get to order until 6:45. My father in law ordered lasagna. He was told it would take 35-40 minutes. It's now 7:35. My sister in law asked for her salad right away. It's nowhere in site. Service is just atrocious.

Update. It's 8:00 and we're still here. Our server has been nothing but rude. My father in law was actually told \"one question at a time\". I asked him about our appetizer and he told me it would \"come out when it's ready\" and proceeded to explain how their oven worked. I spoke with the manager and all she could tell me was that it's backed up in the kitchen and sorry for the server. Then she disappeared and never even bothered to check back on us. Sad thing is the food is actually pretty decent. It's a shame the service ruined this experience for my daughter."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever been any more disappointed in a restaurant. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, it tasted rancid. I could've cooked a more gourmet tasting meal using store bought canned sauce. My friend requested a plain Hawaiian pizza and received a Hawaiian pizza with no pizza sauce and bbq sauce drizzled on top. When she expressed her concern then asked for a new one to be made the waitress acted as though it was normal to have bbq sauce on the top of a Hawaiian pizza. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!"}
{"text":"Went in at 1:00 PM for lunch.  The waiter acknowledge us and told us he would be right with us.  He was in the back folding napkins.  He than went into the back, brought a bill to a table and than went back to folding napkins.  This was about 5 min and other people came in waiting also without any acknowledgment.  I found this very rude and unacceptable, since there was a sign saying wait to be seated. After a few more min. we walked out.  The restaurant was not busy.  Stay away, till they get better waiters. I saw one other waiter who went passed us but didn't make eye contact."}
{"text":"The Steak 'N Blue and Chopped Gorgonzola salads are yummy!! My husband and I have been coming here for years and have never had a terrible experience. Cameron is our favorite waiter but they are all great! By the way, the bread is always fresh and 100 times more flavorful than Olive Garden's bread sticks."}
{"text":"Great place and love the brand new location. The new restaurant is more open and there are a couple of private party rooms. We have been going to Babbo's since they have opened in Surprise, but wanted to write this review especially today to say thanks to Babbo's for donating 100% of the proceeds today to the victims of Hurricane Harvey.  We will gladly support any business that is willing to help those in need. Food is great, atmosphere is great, and the staff is always friendly and great. Kudos to Babbo's!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new pasta place, but I do not know if this is it.

My husband ordered a meatball garlic pizza which was amazing.  I ordered chicken limone (I think) and it was pretty good, but there were hardly any capers or artichokes in it.  I used to go to an old mom and pop place where they had a similar dish with angel hair pasta and it was filled with chicken, artichokes, and capers.  The pasta here was pretty good, though!  It just needs more artichokes and capers. Heck, I'd have preferred less chicken for more capers and artichokes.  

The tiramisu was disappointing.  I wish that the advertisements were more clear.  Tiramisu is made with lady fingers, espresso, marscapone cheese, etc.  The dessert was tasty, but it was not a tiramisu.  If I had known I was going to pay $7.50 for cake and a frosting like topping, I would have ordered the cheesecake.  It was good, but please do not call cake a tiramisu unless there is at least espresso and marscapone.  I could live with cake substitution over lady fingers, but gosh I want to taste espresso and real cheese.

The tea was super watery.  I should have just ordered a water, and maybe next time I will.  

The bonus was that the waitress was super friendly and the service was top notch.  Portion sizes were excellent too, so we may be back."}
{"text":"Not generally fond of chain type restaurants, however this place never disappoints. Good food, decent wine, great service. Don't leave without having the zeppoles for dessert!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner las night 9/24/2015 and was totally underwhelmed. I got an email for 20% off for friends and family so I decided to take my mom and friend out for dinner. Our waitress wasn't very attentive, an my friend had 1 glass of wine and asked for another when his entree came, after he was DONE with his pizza the wine finally came. We Wayne it sitting on the bar area for a good 15 minutes as 2 managers and the waitresses all repeated walked by.  When the manager came over and asked us how our meal was when we got the check, after we explained what happened he just said sorry, no offer for even a cookie. I don't think we will ever be back. There's plenty o good Italian restaurants nearby to go to!"}
{"text":"Terrible! Order the manicotti, told waitress I wanted something lite. Covered in a thick, strong wine tasting horrible sauce. I took 2 bites and was not able to finish.  Also ordered at our table, the spaghetti,  came with 2 burned meat ball, and very little runny sauce. We asked if we could get meat sauce instead of meat balls and was told it would be 5$ more.   Will never return."}
{"text":"A solid 4. Good flavors and the veggies in the main course are very fresh. The salad with the chalkboard menu was a good size. The lettuce was maybe not the freshest on the day we were there.  
Overall the flavors were wonderful.  The bread was awesome especially with the balsamic and olive oil with which it was served.  My wife had the great white buffalo and it was both spicy and good flavor.  
Price for size was appropriate.  
We will return."}
{"text":"We generally like their dishes to include spaghetti and meatballs and steak salad.  Service is usually pretty good and servers are nice.  Drinks are a bit pricey for hard alcohol.  They now get 3 stars due to the new tiny font menu.  If you're sight impaired, read the menu on line before you go because the menu is hard to read.  I don't use glasses for reading but it was horrid.

Guess they don't want senior citizens visiting anymore."}
{"text":"Monday is their special $5.99 spaghetti night - and there was a 30 minute wait at 5:00pm.  Once seated we were promised bread but had request it a bit after drinks arrived. And I insisted on getting bread before we placed our order.  I prefer traditional Italian loaf bread. This was something else.  Others liked it.  Our Ceasar salad ($10 for large salad) was okay but the dressing was a bit boring for my taste.  Spaghetti sauce was unsophisticated, but okay.  Meatballs were very good! Servers were friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Great food, waitress was very pleasant and helpful with helping the others that were with me determine what they would like. Awesome service."}
{"text":"We went here for a quick lunch today while waiting for my boyfriends sister to have a baby at Arrowhead Hospital. 

It was a great experience. 

Service was exceptional. Wish I remember the name of our server. He was super nice and helpful. Food came out in timely manner. 

There was seven of us and everybody liked their food and atmosphere. 

If you are in the area, I would for sure recommend this place! Lots of choices of delicious pastas, salads, pizzas, etc."}
{"text":"Good Italian Food priced about right.  Good Service and clean atmosphere.  Caters to groups. Nearby is Yogurtini for dessert - YUM"}
{"text":"WOW.. I just took the Babbo shaft!! Three Of us went for the Monday spaghetti and meatball special. 5.99 x 3 equals 17.98, no prob. Two of ordered extra sauce. NEVER, NEVER DO THIS! They charged me $9.50 for the \"extra sauce\" Had I known, or even imagined in my wildest dreams they would pull this, I would have ordered an extra special for 5.99, and pitched the meat balls and spaghetti in the garbage. Way further ahead.

Still great food, just deplorable business practice.. Any server worth their weight in tips should have told us the ridiculous extra cost."}
{"text":"Went to the new location for an early dinner on New Year's Eve and was not disappointed! Waited 45 minutes but they have a lovely patio now with a fireplace. The food was excellent! They have a Chicken Parm now that was delicious. The waitress was laid back, efficient and friendly. Everyone was in good cheer and I really liked the new decor and size of the restaurant. And the new area for take-out will be useful as I plan to pick up occasionally. Yummy; feels like a local establishment rather than a chain."}
{"text":"We went here few times to pick up our order. 

Everyone was super nice and welcoming. 

While waiting for food, they always offered something to drink. Place looks nice and clean. 

Many pasta selections to choose from. Just be aware, pizza is pretty small size and if you are super hungry,perhaps you might not want to share it."}
{"text":"We had reservations for 7 people at 6pm tonight. Walked in at 555 & hostess said sorry I gave away your table. Said it would be a couple of min 35 min later we sat down & waited another 10 min for server. I understand it's a Fri night but come on. Hostess gave us a couple apps comped did not make up for wait. This was first & last time here. Food was OK."}
{"text":"Hear lots of good things about this place, so I decided to check it out. I was very impressed, a lot  of chicken and seafood dishes on the menu. But I ordered spaghetti and meatballs, and it was more than I could eat. I kept asking for more of the bread, which was very tasty as well, My boyfriend ordered chicken fettuccine, and it was very good as well. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited the Cave Creek location last Saturday at 3:15 p.m. When we arrived at the restaurant, a red headed guy came over and never uttered a word to us. He grabbed two menus and sat us in a booth.  After waiting 10 to 15 minutes with absolutely no service, we left as we were apparently invisible to the staff. Unbelievable- we won't be returning.                  Jen B"}
{"text":"We just happened to stop in here after been shopping discovered that it's a brand new location for them.  So beautiful, it's new it's big, clean inside. Our server highly recommended the garlic shrimp alfredo over linguini and it was very very good we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Babbo at the new location on Ray/Rural, never having been. Husband and I were told that they had been open three weeks. We got there around 5:30 on a Friday night and although the bar was jammed, the dining room was way open. We sat down and perused the menu. Kasey, our server, was funny and entertaining. She recommended the white sangria from Babbo's extensive wine list. (lots of cocktails, red/white wine, some premium liquor). Nice happy hour specials for the bar/patio only, but Kasey extended them to us although we were seated elsewhere. Nice touch. 

The service was amazing fast. We got both entrees in ten minutes. 

For the record, the sangria was excellent but that's where it all stopped. The focaccia sticks that came with dinner were greasy and limp. Our entrees (chicken limone and chicken jambalaya) were just okay. We have had much better elsewhere. Since I am cutting carbs, I asked for the limone dish served on a bed of asparagus which was offered on the menu. Kasey told me no but she could get me broccoli instead. Instead of arguing, I agreed. Perhaps they were out of asparagus? My dish arrived with about five small broccoli florets. Hmmmm....is broccoli THAT expensive? For the price, I expected more. Not Buca di Beppo-sized entrees but maybe Rigatoni-sized? 

And why is there no lasagna on the menu? There is spaghetti and meatballs as well as many other standard dishes, but no lasagna, always a good test of an Italian restaurant for me. 

By the time we were ready to go, the place was packed with many poor people sitting out in the heat. So sad Babbo didn't plan for the overflow better. 

(On a side note, husband says that the men's room is nicely appointed, marble sinks and all.) 

While I might go back for happy hour for the specials, ($4.00 for a big sangria!) I would not go back for dinner. We both felt the menu was overpriced for the quality and quantity of food served. It's back to Rigatoni's for us!"}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing and the apps are great as well. Go during happy hour and the personal pizza is $6.00 as well as most apps. I have gone three times and I haven't been dispainted yet."}
{"text":"This was terrible, I have brought my gf here twice and both times the food was bleh and the service the second time was horrible. I last ate here back in August, so I don't recall our waiter's name but he was just awful. We ordered the bruschetta trio our last time there for our appetizer. We went with 2 of the meatballs and the ribeye. The meatballs were really good, the ribeye was subpar. Their free bread was very greasy and unappetizing. For our dinner I ordered the Mushroom, pepperoni, sausage calzone, it was ok, but was 70% mushrooms, so that was disappointing. My gf ordered the chicken alfredo, the noodles were dry, and stuck together. The sauce was congealed and the chicken rubbery. We will not be eating here or at any other Babbo's again. Olive Garden is better then this place, and that is sad.

I recommend going to Oreganos on gilbert or Bucco Di Peppo on Val Vista instead. A longer drive, but well worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Babbo has a great food/menu, good prices, good service and a good location.  What more to say?!  

The atmosphere is very nice, with an outdoor patio, as well.  Being on the corner of Signal Butte and Southern, it wasn't too noisy.  

They have an excellent Monday nite spaghetti special with a price that exceeds expectations!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Babbo...maybe just not this location as much as others.  I am giving this location 3 stars, but mind you the location on 16th St. is deserving of 4.  Guess it is all about the location in this case.

We arrived shortly after 7 pm on a Monday night.  The place was packed!  I really wanted to sit on the patio and eat, but apparently you can't drink alcoholic beverages outside, so inside it was.

It seemed as if they had about 4 new people starting.  Our server had a shadow and he followed every action she did in succession with her moves.  Slightly odd.

The bread was delivered to our table promptly.  What a nice treat!  I like that they sliced it up for us and brought us extras free of charge to munch on.  It was fresh, warm, and had the perfect amount of baked red onions on it to add a hint of sweetness.  Fear not, they also provide you with a plethora of oil and vinegar for dipping, to which I added mounds of pepper, parm cheese, and crushed red pepper to spice it up.

We decided to order a side mista salad to split with each other.  It was ehhhh, but not as fresh as I have experienced before.  I do really enjoy the mista salad and the variety of items that are in it.  It is not just your traditional crappy house salad that you get from many other competitor restaurants.

The food took a while to arrive, so more bread was delivered in the mean time.  I ordered the creamy garlic chicken and my fiance the southwestern chicken pasta.  For both, the sauce could have been a little thicker, but in either case it made for great dipping of the bread.  The sun dried tomatoes in my pasta were horribly sour and added a slightly funky taste to the whole meal.  I settled with picking them out and the rest was okay from that point forward.  I added in lots of extra parm cheese to give the sauce more thickness and ultimately provide more flavor.  

I decided that I preferred the meal that my fiance ordered better than mine (I HATE when that happens!).  I did notice a lack of overall ingredients such as the bell peppers and green onions, but in either case his was delicious.  He mentioned that the peppers were a little undercooked and may have tasted better if they were sauteed. 

Overall, not a bad experience, but I definitely prefer the alternate locations as of this point.  I will definitely go back and give it a second chance and hopefully bump up my initial rating."}
{"text":"Any place that calls itself an Italian eatery should have a freakin Chicken Parmesan sandwich or entree on the menu. Nowhere in sight.  Enough said. Get a clue Baboo or take off the \"italian\" part off your name please."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst meals I have had in my life. The service was suspect at best. The manager on duty was rude and the attitude in the  restaurant reflected that. The Alfredo sauce was horrific."}
{"text":"Nice looking interior space, very clean. This was our first time in this restaurant. We arrived early, but during \"happy hour\".  The waitress never mentioned a happy hour, so we thought they didn't have one. My husband ordered a chicken pompadour with a side salad. His opinion is that it didn't taste like any Italian dish but more like a concoction that someone tried to make Italian. I ordered the Chicken Parmigiana. Again, it was OK but nothing special. In my opinion it  chicken was deep fried and salty. The entrees apparently do not come with a side salad. We've been to Italy a half dozen times and have eaten in several really good Italian restaurants in the area. We will not be going back to this one."}
{"text":"Very nice selection of pasta and salads. I've tried several and loved everyone and my kids love it also ($6 kids meals). I wish they'd have smaller portions on all of their pastas for lunch because the lunch pasta and salad for $9 is great but the pastas you get to choose from is very limited.We would probably eat here alot more often if this happened. Avoid Mondays as it's all you can eat spaghetti and meatballs and the entire Sun city grand shows up ugh. Takes forever to get a seat."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday.  It's new to the East Valley, but come to find out they have 6 locations.  I was expecting an Italian fast food restaurant, but instead walked in to find  a very nice ambiance with a full bar, not to shabby wine menu, and loads of wonderful sounding meals.  The wait staff were all very friendly and attentive, which is high on my review check list.

They immediately serve you warm flatbread with olive oil & basalmic dip, it was a nice plus.  I had the lunch special with Mushroom & Asparagus pasta with a Mista Salad.  The salad was great, lots of ingredients with a vinaigrette dressing and the pasta had a nice flavored cream sauce.  I'd definitely order this again, except for the fact that there are some many other options on the menu that sounds delicious, I want to try them all.

My husband ordered the Meatball Sandwich with Pasta Salad.  The sandwich was served on a flatbread and the meatballs were very flavorful.  My husband thought it was delicious and would also order it again.

We had enough leftover to have for dinner that night.  The meals averaged $10, a great value for the money.  I'm so excited to have a new place in the area that has great food and gives you the option to have a glass of wine or beer with your meal.  Check it out, I don't think you'll regret it."}
{"text":"We really like this family friendly restaurant. Consistently good food at good prices and friendly service. We're here about once a month to share a salad and delicious pizza. Hubby really likes the Chipotle chicken entree. Then we do a little shopping at Frys after dinner. :-)"}
{"text":"Had the Chopped chicken salad.  It was great! I had the small size and it was just right.  I'm sure I would have  left over if I had the large. 
Kids ordered the 16 \" pepperoni pizza
 Also very good.  It was more then we could eat. They had three unsweetened ice teas to choose.  I had the blackberry. It was not sweet good flavor I add lemon. Looking around all the portions seemed large. Most people left with to go boxes. Service was spot on. There was no wait at seven on a Friday night. I recamend you give it a try.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Love babbos. I was a little surprised to see the garlic shrimp increase to almost  $15. But that was ok since it's so good. However the shrimp are now 1/2 the size they use to be, andcrubbery/watery indication of frozen. I hope this doesn't last and they realuze this is a misguided direction."}
{"text":"Pros:
Great service: Our waiter was awesome. He adapted to the mood of the table (10 people) and made honest recommendations for the menu.
Pleasant environment: it's a smaller restaurant but the layout makes great use of the space it has and gives the restaurant a type of great room feel to it.
Appetizer: the bread and oil appetizer was delicious. Flavorful breads. I cannot recall the names of the appetizers we ordered but they were pretty good.
Dessert: tiramisu was spectacular!

Cons:
Main course dish was a chicken and fettuccine for myself. It looked and tasted like a slightly improved Maria Calendars frozen dinner. The chicken was literally cubed....That being said, one friend of mine ordered the Macaroni and cheese and said that was delicious. There were a variety of other dishes around the table with no complaints that I heard, so maybe it was just that dish."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and have been more disappointed each time. All the pasta is pretty average and nothing stands out. The last time I went there I ordered chicken alfredo, and the alfredo sauce didn't taste right at all. The sauce was very runny and had more garlic flavor than alfredo.

There's a place called Vogue nearby I would go to any day over Babbo."}
{"text":"We have been dining at Babbo for awhile now and really enjoy the restaurant.  We come for the spaghetti and meatball night special often. This past couple weeks we went and I tried a 10\" Sicilian pizza which was great, not sure everything needs Parmesan though.  My girlfriend  had the full buffalo chicken salad which was a really good size and super tasty.  Then this past weekend we took the kids, while we did have to wait awhile as it was busy, they could use more of a waiting area.  Once seated the staff was great as always, very friendly including the bus service staff asking if we needed anything while they were cleaning off tables nearby.  My son ordered Amy's lasagna which he said was very good.  We enjoyed the Buffalo chicken sandwich remodeled, I have to say this is a good option.  We had plenty of bread while we waited for the lasagna, plenty of bread, oh my!"}
{"text":"We were celebrating a particular school success--and payday, and the holidays--and my daughter wanted Italian. I had read the review and the website, and I recalled seeing the billboard on I-17. Some of the menu items sounded good, so we chose Babbo's over some of the other Italian places in town. Smart move!

Don't expect quiet conversation here--the atmosphere is fairly noisy, with no soft surfaces to blunt the sounds. On the other hand, after a few minutes, it just sounded like people really enjoying themselves.

Then, the waiter came to take our order, and brought us bread and a plate w/olive oil and balsamic vinegar. He was prompt and polite, and took our order without writing it down. Not something I could pull off! The wait staff, each and every server, was attentive to the diners needs throughout the room. The food came quickly, and then the rapture set in!

This is some very good food. My wife ordered a calzone, and it was the size of half a basketball! OK, maybe one of the smaller playground ball, but it was huge! The dough had puffed up above the food, but it was still quite full. My daughter had some type of Italian soda that was quite good. Her stuffed manicotti was wonderful, as was my Bowl o' Bolognese.

Highly recommended. Bravo, Babbo!"}
{"text":"This a great little italian place. The decor is stylish and the ambience is romantic. The food is excellent and house chianti is very tasty and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My husband and I had pastas and tiramisu. GREAT service and  food. Favorite restaurant. Manager was great at the Surprise location."}
{"text":"A lot of people recommended this place and every time I drive by this place its always busy. So i decided to try it. The food is generic and boring. No flavor. You can go to Olive Garden and get more flavor and that's sad. The place is nice the staff is nice but the food is nothing incredible."}
{"text":"If there was a 6th star this place would get it. It's amazing how the entire staff is fairly young (early 20's to early 30's?) yet they are probably the most professional and classy staff I've experienced, anywhere, ever... They are ALWAYS on top of things, very friendly, very efficient and from the taste of the food it's no different in the kitchen. I just can't say enough good things about their service. 

The food itself is absolutely delicious and they have a pasta special, $5.99 for Spaghetti and Meatballs on Monday and Tuesday nights. It's a generous portion, very filling and very gourmet tasting.

The atmosphere is top notch and even when they're very busy it never takes too horribly long to get seated.

Other Phoenix Businesses should go spend a day at Babbo's to learn how to be successful."}
{"text":"Sorry!
Went for lunch 6 of us. No one can think of a good thing about it. Totally understaffed, and the food was awful. Service was horrible .  Prices are astronomical for what it is. They were busy too."}
{"text":"Babbo's has the best bread ever! Try one of their steak sandwiches. I usually get the \"Steak Rusticana\". We eat there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Had the roasted Brussel sprouts, etc  with the steak from the chalkboard menu. Fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Had italiano sandwich, oh my god if you could finish it you're doing good its huge. Absolutely delicious big huge chunks of fresh mozzarella, and there isn't any chips are to die for. Our server was named Amber and she did a really nice job. Next time I go I'm going to try the pizza it looks delicious"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience last night with the hostess.  We were greeted and seated by a snotty girl who made it clear to us that she didn't really want to be there.  Then to my total shock, she openly gave one of the servers the middle finger from across the restaurant.   I reported it to the manager and she offered no apology, but said she would talk to her.  Well I guess that happened sooner than later, because the hostess then gave me a quite over obvious, \"death glare\", for the rest of the time I was there.  The hostess also was slumped over the podium most of the time and loitered around with other servers at the entrance.  Social life obviously more important than work.  I have only been here twice, don't think I would return."}
{"text":"Wow awesome restaurant !! My friend took me there and i loved it! First they offer amazing bread with olive oil which i rarely see at restaurants these days... then we ordered the steak and blue cheese salad, huuge portion we had to share it and the steak tastes delicious i love how it is cut super thin. Service is good and restaurant ambiance is nice. I will definitely go back for that salad !!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite places to go when I want to grab a meal with a old time friend of even with family members. The staff is very attentive and the food is great! My favorite - the creamy garlic chicken pasta. And to top of the meal (even if I am beyond stuffed!) - zeppoli. It's definitely a dessert you gotta share because it's more than enough. Mmmm..."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and heard good things about this place. It did not disappoint! Our server Ivonne was simply amazing. She was prompt, friendly and helpful when choosing our appetizer and entrees. For the appetizer we had the Firecracker rolls (buffalo chicken and steak) for en the Mac n Cheese which was so very delicious and creamy, and the Garlic Shrimp that was very flavorful as creamy as well! Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We have been to this place several times since moving to Surprise last year.  The food is wonderful, and the service is usually great.  We have only had one issue, and it was quickly resolved by management so I won't even count it against them.  I am Italian and often have a hard time eating at Italian restaurants unless they are really good.  This place is really good!  I have yet to have a bad meal here.  This place is busy, so be prepared to wait a bit to be seated and get your meal.  I don't see this as a negative at all.  Good things come to those who wait!  Get off of your phone and talk to the people at your table!"}
{"text":"Great food, delicious freshly made bread, slow service."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and this place was recommended to us. What a great place to eat Italian. The staff is great, and helpful. Their flavors are better than Olive Garden.  We definitely recommend this place and it will become a favorite"}
{"text":"Just tried this restaurant for the first time and it was AMAZING!!! It was definitely busy which is great since they just recently moved. Our server Camron (Cameron?) was awesome! Friendly, courteous and very attentive. He even offered a vegetarian sauce for me (very much appreciated! Thank you!)  Everyone working was right on point - As soon as we finished eating someone would come by and offer to take the plates out of our way. The food was INCREDIBLE!! Absolutely delicious. The portions are well sized - we had extra to take home :) We will definitely come back!! Highly recommend this gem!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have tried most of their chicken pasta dishes, spaghetti and meatball, and some of their salads. My husbands favorite pasta is the Chick Fettuccine. I really enjoyed the Chicken Limone but I almost always order the Chicken and Artichoke Calzone with extra Marinara sauce. Placing an order online is easy and convenient. Sign up for emails to receive great offers."}
{"text":"It's sad to admit that I lived across the street from Babbo for over a year before finally trying it out...it was great, and I'll definitely be back. The portions are huge and I was really impressed with the salad and pasta I tried. The salad was made with brussel sprouts and beets - unusual and tasty. I ordered plain old spaghetti and meatballs as my entree and it was really great! The sauce was homemade and I loved it. My portion was enough for three meals which was also nice for about ten bucks. The atmosphere is pretty ordinary, but there is a neighborhood feel which is rare and appreciated :-)"}
{"text":"1st time here and thoroughly enjoyed.  Had fried ravioli and fire crackers for apps.  A mix of entries between 6 and all were good.  Surprised the tables were not as filled but I would recommend for a nice casual dinner with kids.  Travis was our server and he was great"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat tonight and saw Babbo's sign and pulled in. I have eaten at the 16th and Glendale restaurant and thought it was good. Tonight the service was very slow. Nice kid but did not even know we had been waiting quite awhile for service. No mention of a special so we ordered the $25 couple's meal. We heard about the special from other tables ordering. Food was OK not special.
Not so sure we would go back."}
{"text":"This is my by far my favorite Italian restaurant to go to, an I've been going to that one for two years. There's been a couple of times where I have done a take out order an I always order the Alfredo with shrimp, but last time I wasn't given bread an noodles didn't have a lot of sauce. The second time I did an order, an Amber picked up the phone super rude an when I went into get my food a blond hostess asked me \"what would you like?\" she had a bad attitude, An didn't smile at all. She seemed like she didn't really enjoyed her job or wanted to help whoever stepped through that door"}
{"text":"Babbo is my absolute favorite neighborhood place to eat! The drunken shrimp, Buffalo chicken Caesar, regular Caesar, pasta martini, and bread is amazing! Servers are all very nice and efficient! Katlyn and Marshall are my favorite servers:)"}
{"text":"Always good food. The complimentary olive oil and bread before the meals is an awesome touch. I usually get their jumbalaya which is awesome. Most importantly my wife has never been disappointed. See you soon."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Babbos! If you're looking for yummy Italian food and AMAZING bread, this is your place. Be sure to ask for Marshall because he'll make sure you have everything you need!"}
{"text":"We tried Babbo for the first time last evening 
The one located at Scottsdale pavilions because we were in the area and ordered two of the protein bowls - the service was good - my salmon was done right - my husband seemed to enjoy his bowl but the vegetables were hard and should've been cooked a little bit longer 
The atmosphere is nice considering it's a mid range restaurant but it was very noisy - we could hardly hear each other 
I'm not sure we'll go back because of the noise unless we go in the off hours - we were there at 6 o'clock
Since we don't eat beef or pork and we don't eat carbs we are not interested in the bread 
And we really watch our fat count so the menu was limited for us and we didn't appreciate the fact that there were no calories listed on any of the items 

With that kind of a menu there is a pretty high calorie menu - it is suggested you have a count for this restaurant - please list your calories 
I thought restaurants were going in that direction and this seems to be a new restaurant concept

Thank you"}
{"text":"The best Italian, our kids loved it too ! We had pizza - perfect crust! And the kids had spaghetti and buttered noodles with olive oil and palm cheese ! 
Perfection! We all wish this restaurant was in MN as well :)"}
{"text":"The wife, aka The Boss, had been wanting to pop in for a while. I had thought we were going to get some fish salad next door but the carb craving was strong. So in we went and we had a nice dinner.

The house bread was hot out of the oven and delicious. We also got the Firecracker Rolls which was good. I also enjoyed the salad it was served on. For our mains I got the Cajun Jambalaya and the wife got the Three Cheese Mac and Cheese. We both had excellent dishes. Portion sizes were fair for the price.

Service was good given that we came in around 8pm. I wouldn't mind giving this place another try."}
{"text":"This is my mom's all-time favorite place to eat at. I like this place a lot too. It's a smaller restaurant, but bigger than it used to be because they have since remodeled. I love the food here. I always get the Fettuccine Alfredo and it's really good. You also get free bread like at most Italian restaurants. 

The service is good 75 percent of the time. Some of the servers are a little rude, but for the most part I have had good experiences. I also like the huge soda glasses. It's nice not to have to continuously ask for a refill. 

Sometimes it's a bit crowded, being that it's not a big restaurant, but it is an overall nice atmosphere and great place to eat."}
{"text":"The service is amazing and the food is to die for. Jessica (our server) was very timely and made great suggestions on the menu and cocktail list! Great place for a family get together or a corporate meeting, they have a huge room you can rent out. Overall this is an awesome establishment I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"After many years coming here we had a terrible experience tonight. From walking in at 4:50 and being 2nd in line and totally ignored for 8 minutes then being told they needed to take our name (mind you there were 8 to 9 tables available for 2). There were then 3 people at the reception area none of who were seating us because there was a booth being cleared for the 5 in front of us. Once we were seated we ordered and our waiter came back later to tell us they were out of the crispy chicken they use in the salad we ordered. How can you be out of a menu item at 5:00. We let her substitute grilled chicken and it was okay. The kitchen didn't have their famous bread ready so we waited some time for that. When we were done with our salad we waited 15 minutes for out spaghetti and finally got up and walked over to where our server was and requested our spaghetti to go. As she went around one side into the kitchen another server came around the other side with our spaghetti. Needless to say we asked for it to go.  Then just as we were getting ready to leave a bus boy dropped a tray full of dirty dishes right next to our table.  I think the spaghetti gods were definitely not aligned tonight."}
{"text":"Food was okay.  Balding manager didn't greet us at door. All the employees seemed absolutely miserable there-especially the manager.  What a depressing mood in this place."}
{"text":"We have been to this location before and had a wonderful meal, so sad to see it drastically changed in a negative manner. We came on a Sunday night at 7 pm and it was dead. The most memorable part of our meal last time was the mozzarella balls which we drove all the way back for, they are good! We ordered them and were told they were out...major bummer. We ordered the crab and artichoke dip since they were sold out of the mozzarella balls and it was absolutely disgusting. It tasted exactly like the canned cheese dip and did not have any crab or shrimp in it at all. For entrees my spouse ordered the Mac and cheese and I ordered the Bolognese. He said his mac and cheese tasted okay..nothing special. My Bolognese was another let down. It was basically like soup, so watery. It was like they threw pasta in there without draining it prior. Not only that, the pasta was over cooked and the sauce had absolutely no flavor. Such a let down and we won't be back."}
{"text":"We tried the bruschetta appetizer and it was amazing. My entree though was not good. Waitress recommended the steak and pesto dish. Steak was really chewy and pesto was watery."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the surprise area! Love all their pizzas and pasta, and the bread they give you before you order is absolutely delicious! Awesome Italian sodas as well. The servers are always very friendly :)"}
{"text":"Deserves ZERO stars. Over priced, bad tasting, over cooked food, even worse service and rude management! Do not waste your money here! I live in the area, have eaten here approx 5 times and at the north Phoenix location.  All experiences were good until tonight, worst experience ever. Saturday night approx 730 pm, it was not very busy, most tables were done and in process of leaving. We had an inexperienced young sever, poor service from all except one server who kept coming by that wasn't assigned to our table, management was non existent and entrees poor tasting. The appetizer was good and drinks were good however. Ordered appetizer, drinks, salad and entree. Server didn't place appetizer order right away because she forgot what we ordered. Entrees came while we were eating the appetizer and they forgot the salads. Said they would remake entrees after we finally got our salads. Asked twice for a pepper mill for oil dip and the server just left the mill on the table as she was annoyed we asked for it twice. Asked for Parmesan cheese and was told it was in a shaker on the table and \"this is not like Olive Garden\". I have not eaten at Olive Garden in 20 years. Guess what? I sure will now. \"New\" entrees were obviously not new. One entree was so hot it was steaming for 15 minutes, most likely too hot on purpose, it's pasta and sauce, it should not be \"that\" hot, meat was extremely over cooked, tough and tasted bad, other entree looked like it was re stirred and microwaved, 5-6 small fishy tasting shrimp, literally 4 leaves of spinach in a \"spinach\" dish and a teaspoon of \"new\" cheese. We didn't complain until the second entrees which were obviously not remade. I tried to eat the dish but just couldn't. The server seemed annoyed and not sorry in the slightest, she did offer another meal. Said they would remove the first meal from the bill. Got replacement entree to go, opened it and it was worse looking than the first one in a tiny container and they are charging almost $14 for this? Where is the manager during all this? Absolutely no where.  We had to ask for the manager. What's his name? Who knows he wouldn't give it to us after I asked. I asked him why he didn't know about this issue and where had he been. He stated he had an errand to run or something ridiculous along those lines. What Manager leaves a restaurant with no one in charge on a Saturday night at 730-8 pm?  This manager was disheveled, rude, had no clue what was going on, didn't know what happened or what we ordered, when we stated our complaints he was even more rude and would not offer to make anything right. Not once did he apologize. Finally he stated he would remove the to go entree that I did not want and take off $5 from the original bill. Really? $5. Wow! We waited forever for him to return which of course was more frustrating. I walked behind our booth where the manager was standing with about 6 people doing nothing, I asked for the bill back and I almost slipped and fell due to water all over the floor. I took out our credit cards from the check holder where we also had originally left a Babbo gift card and walked out of the restaurant. This \"manager\" proceeds to follow us (2 females) out to our car and starts taking photos of us, our car, license plate, etc., we asked why he was doing that and he said because we left without paying and was he was calling the police. We were shocked! We said no we did not do that and that we had left a gift card in the check holder. This \"manager\" said oh I didn't see it. Of course he didn't, if he was actually doing his job he would have. WE called police, we gave our name, car info, phone info, an account of what happened and asked them to call us if there was an issue. They said they would not come down to the restaurant as it's a civil issue. I emailed the GM asking for her to call me to make her aware of the terrible service and food coming out of this so called restaurant. We will not be back, will not recommend this place and will make sure everyone knows how this place treats people."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Italian, this isn't the place. The food is pricey and not special. Although it's tasty it's far more Americanized. The place itself is beautiful, and small, but practical. It has a lot of seating inside as well as outside. Come casual during lunch or dress up for dinner, you can definitely do both here - it's a cute and classy place. I personally think it's great for everything, family, friends, and dates. :)"}
{"text":"A  new place caught my eye, so I did what any good Yelper would do, I looked for  reviews on Yelp of course! That did it, the rave reviews convinced me that this is a place worth checking out for myself! It's a sexy little restaurant tucked in an unexpected spot and lucky for me it's on my side of town, East Side! The decor was beautiful, I wanted to take the chandelier home to put in my own kitchen, but it was too big to fit in my purse, jk . 
So on with the more important subject, the food! It was fabulous, wish I could speak Italian so it sould sound as wonderful as it tasted! My daughter got the children's Mac & Cheese and it looked so good we all tried a bite. I had the Curry chicken and pear pasta, amazing.so good that the leftovers I planned on taking to work the next day I ate that same night. I also tried my son's Chicken Chipotle & pasta and his Dad's Chicken Limone, all so yummy! 
Our server was Dean and he was prompt & curteous and funny, he brought me my \"diet whatever drink with lemon\" and kept my glass full. The portions were filling and more and the prices were affordable! 
I'm definitely going back, there are so many things on the menu that I want to try. Next time it is dessert first!
 I'm  in love with Babbo Italian Eatery, it's definitely Amore!"}
{"text":"The pastas are great, the pizza is fantastic, the sandwiches are wonderful and my wife says the salads are great if you eat that kinda thing!"}
{"text":"$5 Monday and Tuesday spaghetti and meatball night is the best deal in the area and it's delicious too. They also have gluten-free pasta. Never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here quite a bit. They also catered our wedding. Salads, pizzas, appetizers, pastas are all very good. I have had a couple of things I did not care for, so tried something different the next time and was pleased. The bread they give you with your meal is excellent."}
{"text":"I really like this place, because of the service and the small space. It's an intimate setting but also has a bar and the wait staff are friendly. We take our 2 kids here and they love it because it's not too stuffy. The wine list was ok, but their pizza was really good. They also have new items added often."}
{"text":"My wife and I started with the bread and plate of olive oil and balsamic,  which was good when our appetizer of grilled asparagus arrived.  it was delicious and came with a small salad on the side.  For our meals we shared a chicken artichoke calzone and spinach gorgonzola pasta with shrimp.  Both were excellent with left overs to take home.  We could have shared one and been satisfied.   Our waitress was Mikaila was very nice."}
{"text":"Love Babbo! Their house made bread is THEE best house bread I've ever had!  The past is great, the pizza is great, the salads are great! Not sure if I can think of a con at the moment. Def love this restaurant."}
{"text":"We both enjoyed our meals. Mine was outstanding, Penne Verducci (something like that) with shrimp."}
{"text":"Came here because of the good reviews.
It took 45 minutes to get my pasta dish. The waitress served me when I  first sat down and never came back to my table?? Food was just ok."}
{"text":"No frills fast friendly service. Quick and delicious food! Portions were good sized and they have a full bar; just what you want after a long day of traveling!"}
{"text":"My husband and I order takeout from Babbo regularly. Their online ordering system is easy to use, and includes their whole menu. We typically order Babbo on a weekend night, and food is usually ready within 30 minutes.
The menu features many different pastas, hearty sandwiches, pizzas, and salads. The portions sizes are very large. Whenever my husband and I order food, we always have leftovers for the next day--part of the reason we love ordering from there. Plus, all meals come with warm bread...which tastes amazing! 
We have never eaten in, but the staff is always very friendly when we go to pick up our food. I imagine wait staff is just as friendly."}
{"text":"Best spaghetti plate since Bob's Big Boy.  My wife and I are always happy with the service and we love the food!  One of my go to spots."}
{"text":"Babbo's is a nice Italian restaurant to visit with friends. Despite its upscale ambiance, the prices here are very much affordable, especially if you sit in the bar area during happy hour. 

I ordered the pasta rustico. It was scrumptious and I got a bit of a food coma afterward - that's what happens when you carb load, but it was well worth it!

The pasta dishes are probably good for 2 meals, so the $11 price tag is really not too steep for a casual lunch out. I brought my leftovers home. The bread and olive oil they serve with it is also delicious!"}
{"text":"I was there for lunch today. The food was excellent, as always. The service was even better than normal, if that's posible!!  My mom had the Mac and cheese, and I had the creamy garlic chicken. Both were so good. Yes I tasted hers!!  We go every month or so. Next we'll try the pizza!!"}
{"text":"We decided to have our family Sunday dinner here and try the place out. The restaurant  was packed but the wait was only about 10 min. The meal portions were good sized and served piping hot. The house wines were so-so but they do have a nice wine selection and offer samples if you wish. I would also say it's more of an upscale / adult eatery, if you have small ones the menu is rather limited and none of the kids meals come with vegetables? They also don't have apple juice or other kid friendly beverages. If you get a chance to try this place out I would do it, perhaps make it a date night though and leave the kids with the sitter."}
{"text":"Have family from out of state so we took them to Babbo's for our favorite Itailano! We had to wait for awhile but it's was so worth it . The manger Kim was awsome! Hope to bring more family there!"}
{"text":"Very good Italian food! Never disappointed! More upper-scale atmosphere without upscale prices Check it out!"}
{"text":"Thank you Lindsay for being so lenient on where we wanted to sit outdoors, and for being a great server to us simpletons! We arrived on a busy evening, with a hot plate of spaghetti and meatballs in mind. Our 10 minute wait turned out longer than expected, we were a party of two ready to order, so we swooped up a free table outdoors. Lindsay was quick to take our order, and was quick to deliver complimentary appetizer bread and our fresh plate of spaghetti and meatballs! And as always, it was delicious. I don't think I will ever get enough of Babbos!"}
{"text":"We have dined here several times over the past few years. When they first opened, the food was served quickly and was high quality. Unfortunately, the last two times we have gone here for dinner we have been underwhelmed. The first round of bread was served cold, the second batch was burned. Two of the drinks ordered were pure flat or just carbonated water. My husband ordered a Margherita Pizza and it was served very over cooked. The server was very accommodating and put in an order for a freshly cooked pizza. Unfortunately, it took so long to get it that we wondered if the server had forgotten about our table. Very inconsistent overall."}
{"text":"Bland or way too spicy & Sriracha? Evoo and balsamic with no seasoning...bland. Salads served i overly small,  reidc bowls...NO procesco at all...whaaaat? Good service tho...ummmmm. Not for anyone with tastebuds.

Chef Jill"}
{"text":"It's a nice place for the prices, clean and good atmosphere.  The staff is friendly and the service is good overall.  The bread and olive oil is always a treat to get and it's hot and very good.

I went there twice to get the spaghetti special and that's the only thing I don't recommend since I'm not a big fan of red sauce.  Normally it's not a problem but their dish is swimming in sauce and there was also water at the bottom of the bowl from the pasta.  Turned into a bit of a wet red sauce mess."}
{"text":"If you're running a marathon or a 13.1 the day before, this is the place to carb load! The menu has a good list of pasta dishes. I ordered the drunken pasta with shrimp, the dish is generous and I couldn't finish all of it. But great for me, I can eat the leftovers at home ;). Plus, there is complementary of bread and olive oil dip to enjoy. The ambience of the restaurant has a modern flare. The place may be busy during lunch and dinner time. I like the take on the different pasta dishes and they're delish!"}
{"text":"Great experience an service very genuine.  I recommend the chicken chipotle.  Also want to point out how clean an neat everything was with it being so busy including the restrooms."}
{"text":"My friends  really like this place.. we were starving. Their free bread was good . Server was attentive.  Their  salad and pizza is a good deal . I ordered  their linguine  and pomodoro . The dish was flavorful  but their was not much pasta . The waitress  said sorry but did not offer to bring additional  pasta. . I left still a little  hungry."}
{"text":"They've got good food and the prices are very reasonable. Some of the dishes aren't quite as you might expect (my Jambalaya was really quite water, for instance) but it was still tasty and I enjoyed it nonetheless. All in all, great food for the price, especially relative to competitors in the area."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at Babbos! Creamy mushroom and asparagus is the most amazing pasta dish I've ever had and it never disappoints! The bread.. Mms mm.. The Brussel sprouts and beet salad it beyond! And even the spaghetti and meatballs is fantastic! And the service is always great!"}
{"text":"So far service exceeds my expectations. server is very attentive, and all I ordered was my beer. Fresh rolls and frosted glass = Great start"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant because the restaurant is comfortable and the service is excellent! I always get the pasta dishes and leave full-to-the-brim and highly satisfied. Only wish they had a loyalty program or eClub to get additional offers every once and awhile to keep the regular customers coming back time and time again."}
{"text":"Delicious italian food. Garlic Shrimp tasted great.  Chickenn parmagiana cooked to perfection. Chalkboard menu was delicious. Italian sodas were so tasty. Perfect choice for dinner in Surprise."}
{"text":"Been to the Surprise location 4-5 times and have yet to be disappointed, nothing extra special, but consistently good and enjoyable.  Both food & service is always good so don't hesitate to try them out, and don't be shy about sitting at their tiny bar if there's room... you'll get even faster service.  Looking forward to the new location opening!"}
{"text":"I came here several weeks ago, and overall was pretty impressed.  It's a very nice establishment with a huge menu, that is very reasonably priced for what you get.  My mom and I had pasta dishes, and they were both around $10 and for the amount of food I received and the quality, I was pretty impressed.  Also when I checked in on Foursquare, we received a free garlic spread.  That was sweet!!  I would have no problems going back here in the future.  Oh also, they have an open kitchen.  I love that aspect of restaurants.  You can see how clean the kitchen is."}
{"text":"Mesa Location
We placed a take out order tonight.  We waited the recommended 20 minutes before driving  to pick up our food (we live right down the street). When my wife arrived, she was told the order would be ready in about 5-7 minutes.  My wife decided to add desserts to our order while she was waiting and was assured this would not affect the order.  Staff and hostess were courteous and attentive.  The inside of the restaurant looked nice and was well presented.  

Our food experience...
Spaghetti and meatballs - The sauce was under seasoned - lacking pronounced flavor. I wanted to taste the garlic, basil, oregano.  Meatballs were unremarkable, dense and without great flavor. 

Calzone - My wife's Calzone was burned on the top.  Inside was a glob of cheese with ingredients that were not distributed properly inside the Calzone.  Quoting my wife - \"I had to dig to find the pepperoni and sausage.  The crust of the Calzone had a \"doughy\"  texture. 

Fettuccine Alfredo - My son got the Alfredo with Chicken added.  He said it was okay. Given our first experience, we are inclined not to order online or frequent this establishment."}
{"text":"Arrived at the restaurant at 8:00 pm.  We were greeted and sat right away.

Server was great but he forgot to bring me the coke  I ordered but I will forgive them for that.  For the record I use to be server as well it's all about being attentive to your customer.

I love the fresh baked bread.  I would come here just for the bread.

I ordered tAmy's lasagna and it was by far one of the best lasagnas I ever had.  From the melted cheese on top to the meat in the layers.  It was everything.

Always a plus when a server ask if you would like some dessert but I had to pass as the lasagna was a lot.

Restaurant overall is very clean and staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying the food is usually very good, the new restaurant is lovely and can handle a lot more seating. However the last 3 times I have eaten there the service has been very disappointing. Last night we waited at least 45 minutes for our food after they brought the bread. The waitress never refilled our water or checked on us during that time except to say once while flying past our table that our food would be coming shortly, which didn't happen. The table next to us even got up and left because they apparently got tired of waiting for their order. When my steak n blue salad arrived the steak was cold. I love that salad but it was obvious it wasn't served immediately. Sure hope they can improve on a few things because it is very disappointing to see a favorite restaurant going downhill.

Following up, I did respond to Babbos with email but heard nothing back from them. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I love posting great reviews-unfortunately, this isn't one. Our first time here for a fun spontaneous visit.
Weren't told about happy hour time/special by hostess or server until I saw the sign after tried ordering. When I asked what it was: was told all wines under $9 are $5. It was right in HH time. 
Was given a sample to try of a cab when I inquired about spicy and flavor. Thats great. Waitress had NO idea and seemed lost. I choose a regular $8 glass
Asked about firecracker egg rolls as in is it spicy? Server mmmm I don't know. Depends lol. So we order just asking that the buffalo stays off just in case never knowing it comes with 3 flavors? I guess. None was explained. 
Once it came half looked cooked other half was red or pink inside, looking as if raw. We also asked which was which of 2 flavors, server didn't know, called someone else over who also didn't know. To be sure found manager who explained it was cooked Italian meats. By then it was turn off although the salad in between was delicious along with excellent seasoned focaccia bread with dipping olive oil. 
We ordered pastas -over cooked. They were kind enough to accommodate my 10 year old kinda picky eater who first thought she wanted spaghetti and meatballs -which she loves, wherever we go. She tried it and couldn't eat it. They kindly brought over noodles Alfredo at her request without wrinkling a brow, thank you BTW, we paid higher adult dinner price anyway. I just wanted her to eat. Sigh. which she didn't eat either. After I finished my salad I found out why. Noodles weren't outright sticky mushy just way over cooked. Easiest thing in kitchen to ensure is right and consistent to ensure it NEVER happens.
Ordering a meal to go was trying as server didn't know there was 2 bolagnese descriptions on menu? I needed to know difference to not waste money and order it. Manager helped. Took it home along with pasta not eaten. No one wanted to eat it that night or next. I never told my husband of our experience or pasta was over cooked. He tastes and didn't eat it. He was being polite lol  
Sad servers don't know basics of menu, food is over cooked and a $40/50 is just bleh. I don't need an4/5 star. Just edible and without incident. Oh also my happy hour $5 wine was $6? Who cares but I didn't misunderstand. I paid for it as we just wanted to go home. 
? bad night perhaps? Manager Joe listened and intervened for appetizers but isn't aware of overlooked pasta. I didn't like \"complaining\" again. it's front and back house job to ensure quality at ALL times. As manager of anything- I wouldn't ever assume my team doesn't need constant on spot training and QA checks, it's why the job exists.  This is a simple fix here."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my folks today. I was pleasantly surprised. The food and service was very good. I enjoyed the mushroom and asparagus pasta. My girlfriend and myself will check out the location that is closer to us in Phoenix soon."}
{"text":"We had the couples special during happy hour. Portion was just right, small salads to start, pasta primavera, a lil caprese pizza & of wine. Super tasty! Raphael served us, he was kind and attentive!"}
{"text":"Ate here with my family for the first time.  I was very surprised at the variety on their menu.  The prices were decent. The kids and adults liked it so that makes it a winner in my book.  Staff was friendly and helpful and I loved the Italian sodas. A great alternative to other chain Italian restaurants.  I will be back with my family and with friends."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant! We come here at least a few times a month and are very happy with the food and the service. I love the brussel sprout and beet salad. The manicotti and lasagna are also two of my favorites. My husband loves the creamy garlic chicken. The bread is fabulous, served with oil and balsamic vinegar.
I bring my girlfriends here for our holiday celebration every year and it  has been wonderful for the last three years that we have been celebrating at Babbo's."}
{"text":"This was The BEST Italian food we've ever had!!! Tyler, our waiter, was excellent and Logan , the general manager, came over to greet us. Each meal was flavored to perfection!!!! Well done!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Babbo's since it opened, but I never thought to review it because it seemed like such a local staple. They provide the full range of Italian dishes here, all of it delicious and reasonably priced. In my opinion, they have some of the best salads of any restaurant. Service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"It took us a while to find Babbo's, since the mapping apps sent us to its previous location, on the other end of Bell Road.  The new location is nearer the 303.

The search was well worth it.  We split a small Brussels sprouts and beet salad (our server recommended splitting the small one -- she said the large one would be too big, since we were also getting some entrees.  She was right!). It was really good. Then we followed up with a couple of pastas, which were very nice, and then we shared the tiramisu, which was fabulous!

We wish we could have located Babbo's earlier -- we would have had a couple of other meals there -- the menu is huge, and everything looked great.

Maybe the mapping apps will be updated soon so other visitors to Surprise won't be surprised when they can't find Babbo's!"}
{"text":"Food was good, could use a little improvement on the service. Had to ask for the drinks we ordered... server forgot and checked with us once, besides bringing the bill. 

It's a little loud, but there were several large groups this night. 

We had the three cheese Mac and spicy Alfredo and sausage. It has a great kick as does the Mac and Cheese. The three cheese Mac has a great smokyish flavor. 

Looks like they have some good HH specials."}
{"text":"Really unimpressed with this place.  We went as a group of 4 and the place was pretty full.  The only table available was in the bar and the lighting was bright, extremely bright (especially for a bar area).  We decided to wait for a table in the dining room which was better.

Service was just OK, and the food was just OK.  I had a chef salad which was nothing special.  It was pretty boring to look at and tasted about the same.  Another person in the group got a sandwich which was a bit of a surprise hit (and made my salad look more pathetic).  The down-side was that they had run out of bread and that person had to wait an additional 10 minutes after the rest of us for their food.  We also got a margarita pizza which was also unexciting.  Service was a bit slow and refills on drinks were non-existent.  Our waitress was boring, especially when the waiter at the next table had that group laughing quite loudly.

This one has been scratched off my list..."}
{"text":"Good Italian food, minus 1star because the service can be really hit & miss here. The menu is large with lots to chose from."}
{"text":"Once again food on one fork.  Just left 15 minutes ago.
Took a photo this time but don't know how to attach to the review. 
Babbo, food was good again."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal!!!! Literally anything you order will be amazing."}
{"text":"I realize I do a lot of eating out when I do these, anywho. I'll first say this place great. I went with 3 others and we were seated right away. The bread is okay nothing crazy in my opinion. Our server came out and got us our drinks and considering how busy it was she wasn't able to be fully attentive to us but she wasn't bad again considering how busy the place is. Food took about 20-25 minutes to arrive and when we got it it looked really good. (I'll have to start taking more photos) anywho I had a personal pizza and it was good! Not the best pizza I've ever had but it was good. I will say their salad is the best thing you can possibly get and their portion sizes are wonderful. Overall this place is great and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service   I like the new place and the menu. I am not a big pasta fan so I really like the expansive menus"}
{"text":"First time seeing the place driving down 16th 

Vacationing from Atlanta and staying at the Pointe Hilton down the street 

Ordered spaghetti and meatballs with a club type salad 

The server was SO attentive and made sure I had plates, silverware, napkins, grated cheese, red crushed peppers 

The to go bag and containers were super nice  

Great job 
I will definitely return in 3 months 

Thank you!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow - we have eaten here for years and never had bad food or service - today for lunch was both. After sitting for over 10 minutes we had to go to the counter and ask to be helped. The salads were awful, lettuce with oil on it. Left most of it on the table - waste of $50 for lunch. Hope it was just an off day -"}
{"text":"After leaving a bad review over a month ago the owner/manager did get in touch with me.  I was pleased with their response/concern but then very displeased that they did not follow through with our conversation. Odd for a company to reach out to a customer and want to make it right but not follow through... I hope it was an honest mistake but it looks bad!!"}
{"text":"This place is a really good inexspensive dinner. On Monday and Tuesday they have a great deal for dinner, only $5.99 for a great meatball and Spaghetti meal. It even comes with a hardy warm bread.
We have come to this location about 4 or 5 times now. Each time the staff is always friendly and helpful.
 The food has been really good each time. Even their drinks are good and not too high. I have watched a bit or two or some good football games here as well.
Every time we go we try a differant anti pasta, again with this, each time really good.
Easy parking, and nice place to come for a meal."}
{"text":"This is really one of my favorite places to go now.
Lots of calories, but very good meal and for a very low price. On Monday and Tuesday they have the Spaghetti and Meatball Special for just $5.99.
Best deal in town, I think.
Bread is great, and I also really like the salad. They make it the Italian way. 
Really good! Heheee
Pizza here is really good as well. Nice crust with great cheese.
Every time we come here,I always leave happy. {Parking is a bit tight) so be careful out there. Nice clean restrooms."}
{"text":"I would have loved to give a review of Babbo this evening.  Came to this location for the first time for some yummy food, good service, and a pazookie, but we waited over 15 minutes and not a single soul came to the table or said we will be right with you.  We walked out without anyone even acknowledging that a table was was leaving without being served. Very sad."}
{"text":"It's a shame that I have to write this review with only two stars because I really love the food here. How is it possible to mess up an order every single time? 97% of the time they screw up my order. I work near by and order at least 2-5 times a month. 
The two stars are for the food alone! Their service is terrible, not sure of her name but the woman who seems to be the manager that's usually at the register is very rude! I have heard this from two other people who have experienced the same worst service from her. You cannot be rude in the hospitality business. 
I love the bread they have and most items on the menu are great. It's pricey, but tasty. 

If you choose to continue the terrible service, lower your prices so it makes sense."}
{"text":"Great Italian food!! Eaten here on a few different occasions, looooove the Italian sausage pasta! Plenty of meat and flavor in that one! Food is always hot, and always served with great service. Great place for a date with that special someone, business, or just casual. I've even done take out! (Call ahead and order anything off the menu! It's great!)"}
{"text":"While I love the food here, the service has been lacking the last 2 times we have gone. 

The food is always delicious and the bread is so good! But don't go here if you are in a hurry - the service is slow. If you are not a regular or sitting at the bar, it appears you are not as important and they will get to you when they can. 

I have not decided whether I am writing this place off yet- like I said, food is good - oh the decisions we have to make."}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant I've gone to in a long time. Our server was extremely nice however the food was horrible. We ordered the lasagna, when it came out it looked like a bunch of melted cheese on a plate. Tried to eat it and cheese doesn't even melt in your mouth. We end up ordering the spaghetti and meat balls and that tasted horrible as well. Sauce was not freshly made tasted more like Ragu sauce. Food is extremely overpriced for what you get. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Tried again after some friends wanted to go there, food was much better as was the service and did not have any stomach distress this time."}
{"text":"OK, I gotta give these guys five stars for not giving up on their customers! :) After my one star review about no communication I got contacted again by the management, a very sweet lady by the way, who offered us a gift card to come in and give it another shot, which we did.

I gotta say it was much better this time and if there was an option of 3 and a half stars that's what I would give it this time. But since 4 stars says \"yay, I'm a fan\" I couldn't go there quite just yet.:)

We got there quite early on Saturday night and got a table by the window. The waitress was there right away to take our drink and appetizer orders. So far so good. We ordered their house merlot which is actually pretty good and some waters of course. The water I got tasted awful, like dishwasher soap leftover awful so I had to ask for a fresh one, which the waitress got for me right away. She was really nice, no complaints there. 

For an appetizer we ordered a Stuffed Portobello Mushroom and that's when it got a little weird.:) A server came to our table literary 2 minutes later with a wrong appetizer. We said we didn't order that and he said \"you want to look at it? Maybe you'll want it?\" :) But then our waitress just sent him back to the kitchen and apologized, said she'll get us the right appetizer right away. I didn't think it was that big a deal though, they made it a bigger deal than it needed to be, especially since it came 2 min after we ordered, so it was clearly the wrong order. It would've been different if we'd waited for half hour but it wasn't the case so we didn't have a problem with that. The mushroom was really tasty, very spicy, but we both happen to like spicy so we really enjoyed it.

For the entrees I got Roasted Brussels Sprouts and Pancetta pasta with shrimp. Again, pasta is only $11 but if you want to add chicken/shrimp/steak you have to pay extra so mine came up to $16. It was really spicy (which I liked) but other than that didn't have much flavor. It was supposed to be in garlic sauce and there was no taste of garlic at all, and was supposed to have parsley on top and I didn't detect a single speck of parsley.:( So it was just ok. My husband got something with seafood (can't remember the name if it now) and said it was spicy too and it was ok. 

So overall, it was ok. It wasn't bad, we enjoyed our night out, and once again, the management seems to be trying really hard to work out any problems that arise, I was impressed by that. We will probably be back now and maybe next time it'll be 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great service by Mikayla! She is extremely friendly and made us feel welcomed. Please make sure to take care of her. 

Excellent food!"}
{"text":"I love Monday and Tuesday $5.99 Spaghetti and Meatball days! The meatballs are really yummy plus the complimentary bread is yummy as well! 

Monday and Tuesdays get busy during dinner time, so pick up orders may at times take longer than 20 minutes. 

Friendly service."}
{"text":"It was around dinner time on a Sunday (when you have little ones dinner is early).  We starting driving south but twin wanted spaghetti and meatballs.  I yelped and this place is about 8 miles from my house.  So we turned around and headed to Babbo's .  The big test is if the twins eat.  I am glad to say the extra star is for my little ones happy face.  My little boy specially ate all his spaghetti and meatballs.  He actually had some from his sister too.  The servings are very large.  I split one order between them.  My hubby had the Sicilian Ragu and he enjoyed it very much.  I had the Pasta Rustica with linguini.  They are very accommodating.  I didn't feel like having penne and requested the change and they didn't bat an eye.  I think they have the basic marinara for most of the dishes and they add a few ingredients to the different pasta dishes.  Like mine seemed to be the marinara with ricotta and some fresh spinach which is great, however, when you add ricotta it makes the sauce a little blander so you need to spice it up a little.  No big deal.  I added some red pepper flakes.  The place is spacious and looks clean.  I will definitely come back with the twins.  I am glad I have somewhere nearby where I can enjoy a glass of wine with dinner.  This was one of the least stressful dinners with the twins.  I know, I paint them worse than what they are."}
{"text":"I have to  tell you all ,I really like this place. I like all of them that I have visited so far.
It seems as if it is a chain, and I guess it somewhat is.
I was told by the staff at another location that it is a Husbacnd and wife team that started this place.
They serve good food and the price is really good. 
The staff is always nice and knows all about the menu.
I like the bread and I really like the salad.
The drinks are very cheap.
We also really like the spaghetti. What more could you want from a place.??

This place is a winner. I say check it out sometime, or any of the locations really. Everyone I have ever been to has been really good. Never a bad experiance at all.
Lots of parking in the lot as well.
It was a great place to stop and eat during all the Holiday drama."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for a friends birthday. It was good. The bread sticks they give you to dip was super good. Also I ordered the creamy garlic chicken, it was good. It was pretty packed. The prices aren't really that bad. They include the tip if you are a big party."}
{"text":"Waited 12 minutes after we were seated for a waiter to acknowledge us.  Never happened.    They lost long term customers tonight--after 4 years of regular visits.  This place is going downhill fast."}
{"text":"Babbos is in close location of our home so we frequent occasionally.  I love their bread that comes with every dinner.  The spring mix salads are good but a little pricey.  The pastas I have are tasty, but nothing that would make you drive across town for.  They can be on the pricey side for the quality of food you get.  Overall, the servers and managers I have come across are friendly but can become overwhelmed during snowbird season.  If you want a nice dinner they are worth visiting, just don't expect mind blowing food but good."}
{"text":"Meatballs had grizzle in them, was not treated nicely when I was there with my hearing dog"}
{"text":"I went here after reading Yelp reviews for my family birthday party. We had made reservations for a Friday night a few days earlier yet when we got there they said the table still wasn't available. (What was the point of us making a res?) We waited not too long and then got seated at a regular table (not what we had requested) and then had to move again because the previous booth party finally left. Finally seated, we had a really helpful waitress who answered all of our questions. We ordered and it seemed to take a really long time for our food but luckily we were all socializing with one another to pass the time. Everyone on here is raving about the free focaccia bread and oil, unfortunately, the bread is NOT authentic focaccia at all, but more of a soft white loaf, and really, any proper restaurant will offer free bread anyways! We ordered the Bruschetta trio and they were pretty yummy but small. I had a pizza and it was VERY average. I say average as I feel pizza can never be that bad. I think the representation of this overall Yelp review misleading and that's why I felt it was important to let people know it's not that great at all."}
{"text":"Excellent $5.99 spaghetti & meatball special!"}
{"text":"We are Marshall.   Great waiter.   He knew exactly how to space  our drinks, ordering and stopping by to see what we needed.   And I LOVED my dinner.   Roasted Brussel sprouts, crisp pancetta,in a light garlic sauce served over fettuccine noodles.   And keep the bread coming.   Yummy and chewy.   Marshall kept the hot bread coming.  Tasty chianti helped wash it all down."}
{"text":"LOVE the new location. The food is just as good as the old place, but the decor is so much nicer and makes for a better dining experience. The staff is as friendly as ever. Now if they would just take down the \"coming soon\" sign on Bell Rd since they have been open for a few months."}
{"text":"Came back with 13 of our friends for the Monday night spaghetti and meatball special.  Excellent food again.  The staff is awesome, most notably Leslie and Chris. They kept our orders straight even though we changed seats, brought the drinks and food out in a timely manner, extended happy hour prices for us for an extra half hour and were cheerful, friendly and efficient the entire time.  They even allowed separate checks among the couples.  Free enterprise at its finest.  What a find!"}
{"text":"Went to the new restaurant, it is much larger than where they moved from, a lot more booths! The lady who seated us however was very rude! We asked for booth, she offered us half booth, I said no, and it must have made her mad, cause she took us to a booth, put down menus, turned her back on us and walked away! But Food was good as always and waiter friendly and attentive! They were out of Parmesan, strange for Italian restaurant, and steak, but I guess they did not order enough! The bread served was underdone, doughy and not browned! I think we will give them more time to get it together before we go back and steer clear of blonde waitress!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Love the bread and all the pastas I've had are great. We really love their 5.99 spaghetti and meatballs on Monday and Tuesday. Such a good deal and great tasting."}
{"text":"We used to go to Babbo in Mesa at least once every 2 weeks - sometimes more often. The food was very good but very inconsistent. At one visit we will order a half a salad and get a tiny salad with hardly any toppings and the next time it is huge. The same is true of the pizzas. Sometimes you receive the right amount of toppings and other, very little toppings at all. Even the waiter commented the last time we were there that the salad was tiny and we both mentioned how inconsistent the food quality and quantity is and he mentioned that he has noticed it also. Last night was the end of all ends. We ordered a 16\" Chicken BBQ pizza with extra chicken - to go. When my husband got the pizza home and opened up the box it was cold, there were almost no toppings and hardly any chicken with a swirl of BBQ sauce. He did not see any cheese, no onions, and the amount of chicken was 17 tiny chunks of pieces only in the middle of the pizza. (This is the menu description of the pizza before the extra chicken: BBQ Sauce, Mozzarella Cheese, Roasted Chicken, Red Onions, Cilantro & BBQ Sauce.) I called Babbos in Mesa right back (20 minutes after ordering) to talk about the pizza and the lack of toppings...\"Holly\" put the phone down and we heard the entire conversation on the phone - as she complained to the manager that I was on the phone and had an issue with the amount of chicken on the pizza - they both agreed the pizza looked good and she didn't know what to say to me. We were so disgusted my husband told me to hangup and we have decided we are not going back."}
{"text":"We tried Babbo for the first time; joining two others for a very pleasant dinner. It was very busy but our anticipated wait was shorter than told. We had a quiet corner booth where we were served efficiently and expertly by Jimmy. His wine recommendation was on target for value of taste and price. Our four varied meals were hot and exactly as we ordered, delicious, and with no surprises. Our only regret is that we didn't find this eatery sooner. We will be back. Sincerely, Karen & Art (Karts) Huseonica, Sun City"}
{"text":"Visiting the area and Babbo's was recommended for Italian food and pizza. The place is attractive but feels cramped. I never get cold in restaurants (even in the winter) but it was cold in here today.
The focaccia appetizer was brought to the table first. It was OK but was cold and did not have much flavor.
Ordered a pizza and salad lunch today. Two other pizzas, a large salad, and a pasta dish were ordered at the table. It took a long time for the salads to come out and we were all beginning to get a little cranky. Once the salads, came out we figured it would not take long for the pizza and pasta to come out. No such luck. The food took about half an hour after the salads. By this point, we were all really cranky. All I could think was that the pizza had better be good. Well, it was pretty good. Hot and bubbly but a little lacking in flavor.
Service was pretty poor. The servers would disappear for long periods of time, refills took a long time, etc. They may have been understaffed (I only saw two servers walking the floor) but the place was only about half full. Three stars---third star because the pizza was pretty good."}
{"text":"Salads are good here. However ordered a a stuffed Portobello minus the meat and got lots of meat."}
{"text":"I went there on April 5, 2010 for lunch with my son. Food was good, service was slow infact a table of 4 who sat after we did got served before we did and there was only 2 of us. So just as I am getting ready to pay, I noticed a baby roach in my iced tea as I was going to take my last sip. I called my server over, who then sent the Manager over (female, dark long red hair). Her response to me was \"We just sprayed, they are probably just comming up\" Um....whaaaaat??? Needless to say...the only adjustment or appology she made for my nasty encounter was not charge me for my iced tea or my son's iced tea! I'm sorry...I used to be a server and in my opinion, especially because she was the manager...that was POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! To me customers service is #1 even if the food is crap, at least the expierince doesnt have to be."}
{"text":"Truly the best happy hour we found in the area. Great food and drink specials and good service. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I don't understand where all these good reviews come from.

The only reason I gave a 1 star was because the staff was friendly and the food was hot. 
I'm a big time foodie that loves good quality tasty food. I ordered the pasta primavera and I should of been at a cafeteria since that is what the quality was like. It had no flavor, sauce was super runny and I had to keep adding salt. \"Where's the garlic\" I was thinking the whole time. (I love garlic). Any who, I definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The service here SUCKED!!! We were a party of 12. We were all UNHAPPY WITH THE SERVICE HERE!!! I will make sure otheres are aware of the horrible service! !!.. Not only that, we were told it would be a 45 minute wait to be seated!! More like an hour and a half..!!! Very disappointed! !!!!"}
{"text":"Waiter very efficient and nice but food was disappointing. Flavorless Drunken Shrimp pasta with overbooked shrimp and whole dish was barely warm served with two slices of dried up lime. Parmesan chicken sandwich was chunks of flavorless chicken over bread with a bright red tasteless tomato sauce poured over it. Have been here before and Gorgonzola salad was excellent but have never found another good dish. Will not return."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat! Especially after a good hike on Squaw Peak. We always get the spring mix salad and some kind of pasta. Lately it has been the Roasted Brussels Sprouts & Pancetta Pasta. And don't even get me started on the bread......"}
{"text":"Amy's Lasagna is Kathy's favorite. Pizza is good, restaurant is usually very cold, service is up and down."}
{"text":"Had out of town company today and we decided to try Babbo since it's just up the street. Our Server, Addie was fantastic. Kept us in drinks and inspite of the fact she was working extra tables she was very attentive.

I had a Calzone (sausage, shrooms and Pepperoni) and I brought half of it home it was that huge. Taste wise it was great.. The Italian sausage has a bit of a kick to it, but delicious none the less.

My company had the sausage and peppers pasta and he said it was delicious.   I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Slowest service ever!!! Restaurant opens at 11 but no one is prepare to serve you, walked in along with another couple and got seated by a waiter that was barely coming in because there was no one to greet us, we were told to take a seat where ever we wanted, got our drink order taken, server brought bread took our order and that's the last we saw from our server for 30 minutes, that killed it for us, I get it's a restaurant but not everyone has hours to spare for they're food especially when you're going to be open for lunch."}
{"text":"I don't  come here in the summer because of the way I'm treated in the winter.
Snowbirds and Bluehairs take this place over, especially on Monday  and Tuesday for the cheap spaghetti... The service  really takes a hit when they are busy. However the Sarah Palin looking waitress does a good job... if she is still here. I haven't  been here in over a year.
The other thing l REALLY dislike is that they don't have a sling for my baby... really?! Spend $100 and buy some slings already!  
The food is good for $6.99 spaghetti and meatballs. The bread is definitely above average and the highlight of the meal. I've never tried anything else and only come here when someone else suggests it.
There are other Italian restaurants around, try them."}
{"text":"Food was fairly good and priced fair considering the portion size.  Except for the drinks though.  Thought it was ridiculous that ice tea cost $3+.   

Service could be better.  We waited a little more than 10 minutes before the waitress came by to take our drink orders.  Typically,  this would annoy the heck out of me and I would have complained but the weather was too nice outside that I didn't mind just chilling out.  

Food came out fast and hot.  I ordered the chicken Chipotle pasta and my sister ordered the pasta dish with Gorgonzola creme sauce.  

I would come back and try this place again.  I'll probably end up sitting inside versus the patio.  Maybe the service will be better."}
{"text":"This place is a good alternative to the usual dine in or take out places we go to. I like that their menu has sooo many options. The servers are very friendly too when you do dine in. I have to say the prices are a little high for what you're getting so it's not a place we can go to all the time."}
{"text":"We went for lunch. Several of us ordered the spaghetti special  (Mondays and Tuesdays). Delicious as always. Comes with 2 extra large meatballs. I ordered the lunch special - mitsa salad and mushroom, asparagus and sundried tomatoes over penne. The pasta dish was very large for a lunch portion and tasted fabulous. I wasn't overly impressed with the mitsa. The service was excellent. This was my first visit and will definitely return. Oh... the bread and olive oil/vinegar... YUM!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food great! Staff friendly!! Shawn behind the bar is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I really tried to like this place. A group of friends seem to like it because they want to occasionally go there. It seems like every time I go, the food is bland and the sauce is almost flavorless. I had a good appetizer there once, but that's all I can remember from the 3 times I've been there. I had the spaghetti and meatballs once, a chicken Alfredo dish, and a pizza. I'm running out of options to try so I'll probably just avoid this place. My friends drink when they go, so maybe that's why they don't notice the terrible food. I'd rather go to Olive Garden, which is pretty bad, because I hate Olive Garden. However, at least Olive Garden has good soup and salad there. If you're looking for a cheap place for Italian food and really don't want to put in any effort finding someplace decent, then this is your place. If you are trying to impress someone, I wouldn't do it here, lol."}
{"text":"First of all, I am a Babbo fan. I have eaten at other locations. I hope that the management reads this review so that the service issues can be resolved.
1. Show up at 5:45 on a Monday and are told it will be a 20 minute wait. We have not even sat down before they call our and another couples name that were told the same thing. This is good news, however, quite a difference between 30 seconds and 20 minutes.
2. I order a classic martini that is delivered sans olives. I ask the server and he apologizes and brings me the olives.
3. Wonderful fresh bread and oil/ balsamic vinegar is provided, however you are not given bread plates. You dip your bread and drip oil all over the table as you eat it. Bread plates please!
4. We ordered off of the \"Chalkboard\" menu. Your entree comes with a salad. Said salad comes on a tiny plate piled high. It is impossible to eat without spilling it all over the table. Normal size plate please!
5. Fast, efficient service is wonderful, but, one of my biggest issues is when the entree is delivered immediately after the salad, whereas you have a mouthful of your salad, with 75% left and they are standing over you trying to place your entree.
6. When the person delivered our entrees and asked if we needed anything else, I asked for a glass of the \"Babbo\" cabernet. She looked at me with an expression that indicated I was speaking a foreign language.  When Michael came by later and asked the same thing, I reiterated my wish. He told me that they are out of the house cabernet. Really? How can that be? Michael was excellent by the way.
Now, about he food:
We both ordered the \"roasted\" chicken. The general definition of roasted is \" a cooking method that uses dry heat, whether an open flame, oven, or other heat source. Roasting can enhance flavor through caramelization and Maillard browning on the surface of the food. The chicken was tender, but pale colored and appeared to be boiled, steamed , or microwaved. No color or caramelization.
The Garlic, artichokes and lemon dish was smothered in inedible lemon rinds.  I am a firm believer of nothing on a plate that is for garnish only.
The good news: The dishes were flavorful. We also had the Wild Marsala Mushrooms. It was very tasty.
The prices are commensurate with Olive Garden, but the service at Olive Garden far surpasses this. I plead with the management to correct these issues to elevate this Babbos to a 4 star place like it should be. I will return to see if there is any progress."}
{"text":"The servers here at Babbo Italian Eatery wear a shirt that has \"Babbo, ten years and six locations\" on the back. After eating here, you will understand why they had to open more than one. 

Babbo is a mostly family run business, that offers simple and very tasty Italian food. It is technically a chain, but management clearly pays attention to the details and the severs in-turn stay on top of things. 

We found Babbo to be nice change. So many of the larger places seem to lose track of you, or they are over working their servers with too many tables. Not here. 

We started with a Merlot and Strong Bow ($11.45).  After our trip to Ireland, I still have a taste for Bulmers. See photos. This was followed pretty quickly with two house salads ($7.99), which were crisp and tasty. 

For our entrées, we order the Pasta Rustico for $10.95 and I tried their Italian version of Cajan Jambalaya. Both were tasty and very good, see photos. The heat on the Jambalaya was just right and it's Italian seasoning and sausages, was both interesting and tasty. 

Btw, the portion sizes were enough for two take home bags. Nice!  Expect to pay $25 each, including drinks and taxes, but before gratuities. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Well I'd actually give babbo 4 stars normally, but I'm doing this because they messed up. I wanted to warn people of their take out because I don't want this to happen to anyone else again. 
We've been here multiple times, dine in and take out. Always satisfied, never super overly impressed, or disappointed, but always really good. Love the chipotle chicken pasta, the bolognese, and the egg roll appetizer thing. 
We'll come back again but we'll definitely check our take out once over before we leave. Even if it means opening everything up and cutting things open to make sure they're CORRECT..
Long story short, we order take out. I get a pizza, wife gets a salad(no mushrooms) and a calzone(no ricotta). She hates ricotta. We get home and of course the salad has a hand full of mushrooms on it. Cuts open the calzone..FULL OF RICOTTA!!! Seriously?! So she calls the restaurant and let's them know of their mistake, the girl on the phone says, \"oh I put the order in and I didn't see anything about no ricotta?\" LOL bs! 
So my wife had to pick around the ricotta and make the best of her dissected calzone.

So apparently from now on if we order a calzone to-go we will make sure to open the container and cut it open there at the counter before we leave to make sure the order is correct.  But hey other than that everything else was great as usual. 
HA!"}
{"text":"My first time I ever went here my mother, brother and myself waited for a little over half an hour to be seated, once we got inside (which was packed seeing it was a Friday night!) we were visited by our waiter, Sean, very quickly. He took our order from memory (and now that I've gone back a few times they always take it from memory) and brought our dinner out in maybe 15 minutes along with our second plate of bread! Unfortunately they gave my mom the pasta dish instead of the salad, which is no big deal for us since we were having a good time together and they were busy so we understood. Both dishes have the same name and she didn't specify which one she wanted. Not even 3 minutes later the manager came to us and apologize and gave my mom the salad and pasta on the house! The staff is extremely friendly even though they were packed! I recommend this place to all my friends and have will always come back here!"}
{"text":"I like their spaghetti and meatball meal deal.  I love their bread that they serve with the oil and vinegar.  yum.  I could just eat that.  We ordered a couple of their salads and they were tasty.  Service is always good.  happy hour specials are nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place.  It is so close to where we live, that when we decide last minute that we don't want to cook, we more than likely call Babbo for carryout.  It is best on Mondays and Tuesdays because they have spaghetti and meatball for $5.99.  They are huge portions too.  It also comes with garlic bread, which is really good.  Sometimes we split 1 and are completely satisfied with that.  I also had the Pasta Rustico, which was really good as well.  We've never dined in though, so I can't really say what that experience would be."}
{"text":"We have been to this Italian eatery quite a few times. We ate in a booth for 2 people in the bar area because one of us wanted happy hour drinks & food. Happy Hour is from 4-6pm in the bar area or patio. A martini is $6. and a 8\" pizza is $6.
Bread with balsamic & vinegar is served to every table and was very fresh tasting.
The special on Mondays & Tuesdays is spaghetti & meatballs for $5.99. Our server Rafael was excellent, just the right amount of checking back with us and was on top of his game.
I did see a \"guy\" who looked like a manager in a blue shirt(younger guy) there were 2 managers  in blue shirts. The younger guy seemed to be on his phone behind the bar and at the register area too often. Wasn't really bothering me,but if there is a problem with something in the restaurant I am not sure how he would handle it, as he was not really paying attention to his surroundings at work. I should never see an employee on their personal phone while I am dining.
Parking is in the lot by Fry's grocery store, can get busy at times in the parking lot, Arby's seems to have too many signs reserving parking."}
{"text":"Been here twice now the first time was out of this world. Service on point and food out of this world. 
Second visit was pretty mediocre. The server was cranky and annoyed. We had several questions about the menu most of them pretty simple but each and every one he had to go \"ask someone\". It was really weird. Servers should have the answer to super basic questions. Food came out super bland and mediocre. Added lots of salt pepper and Parm as it was very plain. Super impressed first time, second time not so much"}
{"text":"Awful, rude and we had unacceptable treatment! We have just moved here and went 2 weeks ago because we called and they said they have a dog friendly patio. We have a 3 1/2 year old Golden Retriever that does not move and sits by our feet. We were treated great,patrons loved him and we had an ok meal. We went back tonight and we're the only ones on the patio and brought our dog again. We were told he was not welcome. I stated that he was a service dog and we ate here before and we could eat inside if we wanted to but just wanted to bring our friends here because my daughter was leaving and would eat outside.  We were already seated and the Jr. Manager came out and asked if we were lying about him being a service dog? I said we have a vest in then car and I would get it. We normally go to places that are dog friendly and do not have him wear the vest because it draws attention that we really do not want. I went out and got the vest and showed the staff. We had the vest sitting next to him and 4 different times they told us we had to put the vest on him. We did...
We shared the law about service animals and what they can and can't ask but she was just getting her information from the owner and doing as she was told. We were with a man that had PTSD and but they still would not listen. My husband was so upset he left the restaurant and we ate without him. This establishment has no signs about the policy and are unaware of the laws. What made it even worse was when we went inside to order a drink the whole staff was talking about our situation and on the phone with the owner. We were very embarrassed and I hope people get the proper training. Our dog never moved and one of the servers said they did not even know we had a dog. We respect that some people do not want animals around the when they eat so that is why we eat at dog-friendly places to respect that. Why is it ok one day and 2 weeks later we are embarrassed? Service was awful, food was cold and they forgot half of what we asked for. We paid the full bill and will NEVER eat here again. Go to someplace else that knows the laws and cares about people with disabilities."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed Babbo!  We came on a Tuesday night, which is apparently $5.99 spaghetti and meatballs night, so it was super busy.  We took a seat with no wait on the patio and really enjoyed our experience.  The service was great - friendly, professional and efficient.

The menu was huge...so many great selections to choose from.  The food was great!  I tried the chalkboard menu of grilled chicken topped with tomatoes and feta with grilled veggies on the side and a side salad to start.  I ate every last thing on my plate...it was that good!  I also enjoyed a raspberry vanilla Italian soda...love that they serve these and they do it right!  

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We order take out from here all the time because it is consistently flavorful and you get a large amount of food for a relatively low price. One of my favorite things to get is the chicken fettuccine, but I order it with red sauce. Its so good and not as bad for you as white sauce. The chicken is good and there are alot of veggies too. My bf is a serious fan of the Steak Rustica sandwich. Their bread is to DIE for as well. I have liked everything that we have ever ordered. It is on our most visited list for sure. May even get it tonight. You should try it."}
{"text":"This Babbo location has significantly improved from my previous experiences. I've been here twice now with the inlaws, hubby, son and guests. Both times, our servers were pleasant, not intrusive, professional, polite, and very accurate with keeping our orders straight. Our food was very good, also improved from our past experiences as well. I'm glad I've given them another try, but I'll be truthful, I'm still not completely sold so we'll stick with a 3 star rating for now. I'm hopeful these 2 recent visits aren't flukes and there is a new standard at Babbo. I'll keep ya posted!"}
{"text":"Ok the food for all the stars for me.. I docked 2 due to Service and My Mojito. 
The food is great! They have a nice happy hour and some lovely appetizers. The pasta is great. I wish I would have taken a picture. 
But.. downside. It was not that busy and we had stacks of appetizer empty plates in front of us. Along with empty cups. Mind you I was very patient and even stacked the dishes in front of me to maybe prompt a pick up. Nothing. It was to a point where after waiting 15-20min I decided to get up and put my dirty dishes on the tray/cart. 
The server that was not well trained well. I say this because when she went to serve our appetizers rather than make room or take some dishes away she put the dang plate right in front of me. Even after I said I didn't order it..

The mojito, I could have sworn they added a bit more juice/sweetener than necessary because that's all i tasted. 

Would I go back... probably not."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've tried the caprese pizza with pesto which was amazing, and the Chicken Limone is great as well! I lived in italy for three years and have found it hard to find italian food that i can stomach here in the states. But this place surprised me! I am a big fan and cant wait to try more things off the menu,

its all at a great price as well!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The bread with oil and balsamic vinegar is so good! The salads are enormous and delicious. They have the best calzones in town as well! I'm able to go there and get a salad, calzone, and tiramisu and split it with my boyfriend and get away for under $25. I definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a really nice Italian meal at a casual restaurant with a really cool atmosphere. It's one of those places that you crave again the next day."}
{"text":"Great food at affordable prices and on Monday and Tuesdays the spaghetti and meatball special is going on, where the spaghetti is only 6.99!! That's a bargain for the quality of food not to mention all the other food options they offer. Staff is always on the move trying to keep things going as smooth as possible. Overall I would recommend coming in and possibly becoming a regular."}
{"text":"Dined at babbo the other night and had a fantastic time. The server was very attentive and kind. He was always smiling as well. Our food came out looking amazing and tasted even better. All in all we had a great experience and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We have gone to Babbo before but only for happy hour, which we enjoyed. We decided to try it for dinner and it was unfortunately such bad service. The hostess was not there and several employees saw us waiting with no acknowledgement. I ordered a glass of Cabernet and waitress returned to say they were out. What? An Italian restaurant out of cab? I inquired if they were out of the house or all Cabernet. Of course there were two other options.  Crisis averted. We asked for more bread, was told they were baking it, then saw it being delivered to another table. Food is good, but the service left much to be desired."}
{"text":"Stumbled into Babbo yesterday afternoon. Didn't really have many expectations, being that I don't often go to chain restaurants often. Met there for a business meeting and holy holy! So glad I went. We were greeted by our awesome server, Janis! As a former server, I appreciate great service, even when the food is sub-par. Can't say the same for this place. Food (protein bowl and lunch combo) and service were excellent. If you ever get a chance, stop on in, ask for Janis and enjoy the company you're with."}
{"text":"Ok yum! I was pleasantly surprised by this place I have been wanting to try it for a while and I am glad we did. I got the goat cheese and mushroom pizza it was vert tasty, but I think the star of the night was definitely the cheese calzone my son got. The cheese was so good.  My husband and other son both got dishes with the red sauce and it was a little bland. They will try something different next time. The prices were also very reasonable and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Went once after this place just opened.  Very disappointed.  Over salty pasta and mediocre apps.  Service was ok.  Will not returned."}
{"text":"Good food, a little too much sauce for both of our dishes. Nice server, but what threw us both off was how many employees were standing around on their phones. The hostess stood there playing with her hair, and on her phone the whole time. So odd! We will be back a nice little joint."}
{"text":"Service is consistently good.  Orders are right and food tastes good.  Small location so often a wait and TOGO orders there is no real place to hang out other then the bar (which is quite small) overall a good choice and love there spagetti specials for the kids"}
{"text":"I stopped going to Babbo about a year ago because of their consistent mistakes. Too many times I came home to food with missing ingredients or had a poor service experience. I was convinced yesterday to get some take out and for convenience sake I agreed to give them another shot. Sadly when we reached home (which is 3 minutes away) the pizza was cold and resembled cardboard. The Napa Valley salad, which is typically an excellent salad, didn't have the extra dressing we ordered. Also, I'm not sure what's going on with the signature bread. When this place first opened the food was hot, fresh and delicious and the service was consistent and pleasant. Another victim of the Cave Creek curse.."}
{"text":"A girl friend wanted to try the new Babbo in Surprise that recently opened up so I met her for an early dinner. Lovely decor friendly staff. I ordered Meat balls & Spaghetti which came without a small salad ($13.50) & was totally underwhelmed by it. It had a watery sauce (didn't drain the pasta enough?) as if the cook opened a can of marinara sauce and dumped it on the noodles - was tasteless. I asked for more cheese expecting the waitress to freshly grind it - instead she pointed to a shaker at the end of the table that already had ground cheese in it (like you get in a pizza parlor). The meat balls were large but than so are their competitors. The highlight of my meal was the bread they served with olive oil dipping sauce which was great. I asked for more but never got it and they weren't even busy (4:00 pm Friday). My dinner was very unsatisfying to say the least. Better stay home & have a jar of Ragu.

I feel that this restaurant doesn't know if it wants to be a high scale Italian Restaurant or a pizza joint. It needs some fine tuning."}
{"text":"OMG, what happened? Based on my visit tonight this place deserves 2 stars. I am giving it 3 overall.
Over the last year I have dined here at least once per month and was always satisfied.
The visit tonight was different. The restaurant was pretty dead for 7pm on a Friday.  We all ordered pizza and our food took an extra long time to arrive at our table. We didn't see our waitress for most of the time while we waited. I really could have used some more water. Anyhow after what felt like forever, she finally refilled our drinks and told us our food should be out soon. Apparently one of the pizzas was burned and they had to make it again. I didn't mind the kitchen's mistake, being ignored was annoying.
Our pizza was just meh. The cheese on my daughter's was in a big clump. The crust on my neo style tasted weird and my husband was not impressed with his calzone. Major bummer since we used to really enjoy the food. 
I am not sure what is going on, but our last two visits have left us sadly disappointed. It looks like this Babbo is going downhill."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised with the low ratings, I loved this place! We got there around 5:15 in the evening & were seated right away, service was lacking but the food made up for it. My husband & I both ordered the $5.99 spaghetti & meatballs special. It was sooooo good. I'm not usually very impressed by such a simple dish but man, those meatballs are amazing. They also had some really good happy hour deals until 6pm that I want to try & come back for."}
{"text":"Had to cater an event.  The delivery came on time with all the utensils, plates, napkins, and plastic forks and knives.  The delivery person was lovely, helped set up and came with a big smile!  Guests loved the food and were impressed.  Would definitely use them again"}
{"text":"From the get I was excited. I had some cold left overs from my ex one time and since then I have been trying to make it over here. The decor was contemporary and stylish and I was greeting with a not so friendly staff. 5 min for my water and a \"yeahhhhh\" waiter. 
Here is the thing. Everything about this place is cool. But if you are big on service than maybe not your place."}
{"text":"This was a very nice mellow restraunt that was perfect for girl talk and resting while helping a friend apartment search.  I liked the food and the prices.  I ordered a salad and pizza special that was very good.  I enjoyed the misto salad and the pizza was very fresh and delicious too.  My friend got a calazone that was steaming hot and looked delicious.  I will definately go back."}
{"text":"My wife, grandson, and I came to eat here today at about 230 and were promptly greeted at the door by a gentleman who I presume was the MOD. He asked how many, we said three and we'd like to eat outside. He said no problem and seated us. Once outside we waited, and waited, and waited. After 5-10 minutes we asked an employee, she was outside with another employee (getting a catering order ready?) if she could get our server, she said yes and went inside to, I assume alert the MOD. After a few moments a server came out, no greeting, no eye contact, and walked past our table to the table directly behind us. Sigh....not our server. After a short time our server came out took our drink order, and everything seemed to be back on track. If it was only that easy. Once she took our order she was gone....okay enough tea, time to use the restroom. What do I see? our food is in the window, our server is yucking it up with the MOD and I am irritated. We love this place! We always get great service!! What's going on here!?!? Guessing just a bad day, I get it, I work in this field, but come on it's slow do your guests right. Hot food hot!! Alfredo should not be clumpy."}
{"text":"So, my wife and I have been waiting for this particular Babbo's to open as it is closer to our home. We have frequented the 16th street store quite often and we were hoping for the same service and food quality. Parking is plentiful, restaurant is beautiful and the restrooms were spotless. The last two items you would expect as the restaurant just opened. When a restaurant opens the staff is typically very friendly and this was true with this location. As with any restaurant there is room for simple improvements. We waited and waited at our table to be greet by our server. While she was very nice she was not well informed on the menu. The store places a happy hour menu on the table, however these prices are on good if you are seated in the bar area. We were not informed if this, however it is stated on the menu, we just didn't see it. We assumed that the menu was on the table, therefore the specials would be honored. We ordered our food and it came out lukewarm at best. The male manager (?) came over to check on us when we told him the food was cold he was very  apologetic, removed the plates and within minutes our food was remade and brought out hot. Our server never brought more bread, this was disappointing as the bread, olive oil, and balsamic is one of the things we love. Will we be back? Absolutely, we understand opening are tough but we also expect the kinks to be gone, service to be on point, and food served at the proper temperature."}
{"text":"We used to go there a lot. I thought the pizzas were great. 
Then we had 4-5 dinners there that were not good. The chicken dishes had hardly any chicken in them. The last time we were there we entertained a party of 5 and all guests had the same complaints,no meat in the dishes. I complained to no avail. All I can say at this point in time is that it is a decent Italian vegetarian restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I had diner here in mid July 2014.  It was surprisingly good!

I had a jones for some spaghetti with meatballs and this place came to mind.  When we arrived I was shocked it had any seats available on a Friday at 5:30 PM.

They had a good happy hour menu of appetizers and a good selection of beers.

The service was friendly and prompt.

The best part of our experience is the food came out quick and it tasted really good.

The manager came to our table and asked how things tasted.  More importantly she seemed genuinely concerned.  I LOVE WHEN THAT HAPPENS!

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Disappointment with the new facility. Very hard, cold surrounding. Extremely noisy. It maybe be called an Italian Eatery but there is nothing reminiscent of Italy. Don't come here if you're looking for a romantic dinner.   The ambiance is terrible. 
The marble walls, glass windows and open ceiling all promote noise. The wallpaper is boring. The bar is open to the entire restaurant. 
The food is run-0f-the mill."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with friendly staff. 
Clean and open floor plan. 
The roasted Brussel and Beet salad was fantastic, the Anna's lasagna was a bit salty but had a nice sauce. 
House cabernet was tasty, overall a nice experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Babbos the food is delicious they could charge higher prices and we would pay.   The staff is fabulous, friendly and quick.   When we have company we run them over and buy them dinner, they have all been pleased even Grandpa.   Everyone should stop by and try them you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant couple of times and I was really happy with their food. They have specialty pizzas and it reminds me of pizza in Italy."}
{"text":"The server was friendly and efficient. 

The food... meh. 

Pasta was over cooked and sauce too spicy. Chicken parm bread crumbs seemed to have msg in them. Very salty and spicy. 

Kids didn't like the pasta. 

Hubby got the calzone. It was just ok."}
{"text":"Seen all the reviews about how great the food and service was, so I wanted to try it for myself. Boyfriend and I go to eat, we get sat quickly, drinks come snappy but we ended up waiting for 15 mins only for the server to check on us once. Another male server is walking around and doesn't even want to acknowledge us. They didn't even want to make eye contact. So they hid behind the bar and in the kitchen so we wouldn't get served. Rule number 1, never judge a person by the cover of its book especially the color of their skin or what they wear, some of US have money and we like to spend and tip GENEROUSLY because getting paid at 8.50 or less an hour doesn't pay the bills but whatever I can spend money and support a different Italian eatery elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good food decent prices thoroughly enjoyed myself up until towards the end of my meal when apparently someone started chopping something or hitting something continuously thought this went on steadily for several minutes with no apparent end in sight.  I finally had to get up and leave as it was quite annoying."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Babbo's.  While it is an average Italian restaurant, it's discount program is problematic.  I've taken advantage of it's discounted gift cards several times.  The card I bought last year was first attempted to be used a few months ago.  They told me it was invalid and I think they didn't believe that I had actually purchased it - I guess they thought I'd stolen it.  Well, after a long repeat visit, the problem was corrected (but for the longest time they thought I was the culprit) and they agreed it was their fault.  So far , so good. Tonight I visited with my wife for her birthday and tried to use the card for the tab. The waitress took it and quickly returned and said the internet was down and they couldn't take the card, but I could pay with a credit card (doesn't it use the internet?).  So much for buying a discount card.  So now I'm out for the meal and the cost of the card.  Now I'm getting concerned, I've paid a few hundred dollars for discounted gift cards that may not be any good AND there was a prominent sign on the restaurant door stating they needed, essentially, people in all positions.  Not a good sign.  BTW, the Manager was not the person who told me about the internet problems.  I'll keep you updated on the resolution, if any."}
{"text":"I will start out with the positives for this place. The food for the most part is pretty good and they do have a great kids menu with quite a few choices. Now the negative, I ordered the roasted Brussel sprout and beet salad which was pretty good. However, it was pretty small considering the $10.50 price tag. In my opinion it is too small to garner that price. Yes, I could have ordered the large size instead of the regular but that still does not equate the huge price for a small sized salad. Which does not include any protein such as chicken, steak, or shrimp. I could have added it and added another $4.75 to my already high cost salad. However, I am not accustomed to paying $15.25 for a tiny salad. Needless to say I will not be ordering this salad anytime soon. But, I will return and gladly order something else, because as I stated earlier in this review the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I often do take out here, but have dined in a couple of time. The food is always delicious, the service is usually great too, but it depends on when you go in. Sometimes I am greeted the moment I walk through the door, other times its like none of the employees care about what's going on."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is busy! The food was great, our server was great! I believe Anne was her name. We had a party of six and I suggest you make reservations because on the Tuesday at 5 o'clock there was a line out the door. Luckily we did make reservations and it made everything a lot easier for everyone. 

We had quite a few different dishes. The kids meals were simple with mac & cheese, with a gluten-free option. Bonus. I have the spicy Alfredo with sausage and it was good. We also had the Amy's lasagna which no leftovers were brought home. Apparently Monday and Tuesday nights are spaghetti and meatball nights at $5.99 a serving which seem like an amazing deal. I also had the house Cabernet which was perfect with my spicy dinner.

We visit this area often and will be returning in the future"}
{"text":"The low reviews must be ancient because we *loved* this place. Yes, it's not high scale in the ambience department. But the service was attentive, the menu extensive, and the food delicioso. 

Our server brought bread and oil and balsamic as we checked the menu. So many choices! He got the jambalaya pasta and I chose the alfredo with shrimp. After settling in to wait and chat with our cocktails, it was a surprise when - no joke - our server returned with our food in five minutes. I wanted to save half to bring home for leftovers, but it was so good. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Good food. everything tasted amazing. I was looking for the nutritional facts for the restaurant since there are a few in the state but could not find anything on their website. Since I am trying to stay on the healthier side, I got the steak and tequila salad hoping it wouldn't be over 700 calories for a regular serving. I am so glad I did. It was fantastic. I normally don't get salads going out to eat. I had a larger groups and everyone loved their food. the calzones are huge and tasty. Service was pleasant and expedient. 

since the last time I was here I think they did a remodel on the inside. It has that comfortable romantic modern look to it now."}
{"text":"So we were headed to another restaurant but they had an hour wait... Yeah that was not going to happen. We ran into this location. What a find !

The staff was very attentive and we were seated quickly. 

 It is what we ordered:
 shrimp garlic pasta ... absolutely fabulous
 spaghetti and meatballs... Was okay
 3 cheese mac and cheese... Fantastic
Crab and artichoke dip... Wonderful... Just ask for extra bread

Overall great experience.

Oh and my daughter said that the bathroom was cute!"}
{"text":"We went to Babbo's for the spaghetti and meatballs special.  5.99 for some pasta and two balls.  We went early because we new there would be a long line of blue hairs and snow birds.  We got seated right away but waited at least 12 minutes for our server to show up.  She brought over some bread but they don't give you a plate to put your bread on.  So you bite it and either lay it on your napkin or back on the plate the oil is on that you are sharing with your husband.  Seems kind of odd to me.  Plate with the bread in it, plate with oil on it but no plate to rest the piece you took a bite of.  Weir do.  Food was ok, a bowl of spaghetti and 2 meatballs.  A fair portion, but if you are hungry than not enough for a growing boy.  I had the Cajun jambalaya which was ok, chicken was a little dry.  Our server was a nice girl and came by often which was good but she 
had a very screechy voice which sounded worse than nails on a chalkboard.  We were in and out in less than an hour.  Nothing comes with the pasta other than the pasta.  No salad or veg.  I guess you have to order those separate.  By the time we left there was more gray hair in the parking lot than 12 seasons of the Golden Girls.  This place is ok, only went for the convenience cuz it was close  to home.  I bet if it had a drive thru it would make millions.  We probably won't go back.  I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Babbo since the place first opened in Tempe. I've heard wonderful things and I'm a sucker for pasta and all things Italian. We ordered a kids pizza for my nephew. It was a nice size personal pizza that was as delicious as it looked. Wonderful sauce and two HUGELY amazing meatballs for their spaghetti. The focaccia bread was yummy too! It was a busy, late weeknight for us so we had to takeout, although I really wanted to dine in. So why the 2 stars you ask?...back to the long day...I order over the phone to take out. 2 orders of the spaghetti and meatballs and 1 children's pizza. Pick up in 20 mins. Done. Go inside the wait wasn't long for takeout. I pay. Done. I drive home, a good 25 mins away from Babbo. Get home. I'm starving. Unpack and wait...where's the 2nd order of spaghetti? Look at the receipt, I paid for both...look again. No 2nd  spaghetti.  Bummer. I call and the person who helped me was very nice. I explain that I live to far to just stop in again and she offers to give me a \"free\" spaghetti. Again, very nice person but wait, you offer me a \"free\" spaghetti? It's not free! I already paid for it. Someone that works there neglected to make sure the order was complete. Ok, maybe I should have checked BUT then again the ticket stapled to my bag had the order correct but what was actually in my bag was  it correct.  I'm just really bummed because one person in my family was out a meal this night. I really, really wanted to like Babbo. Maybe if I ever go get my paid for/ free spaghetti ill have a change of heart. LONG STORY SHORT: NEVER ASSUME YOUR ORDER IS CORRECT WHEN USING TAKEOUT OPTION HERE!"}
{"text":"Best salads ever! I've also had the curry dish and it wad good too. My sons Alfredo had a not too much garlic in it but he keeps ordering it so it must be ok."}
{"text":"I am an avid Babbo's enthusiast. I have been frequenting for 10 years at the original location and come here about once a month. They have a wonderful happy hour.

Everything I've ordered is delicious. The garlic hummus is divine; pizza, salads, pasta and sandwiches all good.  All food travels well to-go. I would highly recommend!

Join their email list! Emailed specials are seldom but  are great! :)"}
{"text":"They had us @ the apps!  The only problem about this place is everybody around got bread and for some reason we got shorted. Other than that great food, great drinks, and great atmosphere.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried the $8.99 lasagna special. Both male and female Hosts/ Waiters seemed irritated when I asked for it . Female took order immediately walked away. The male 
said it wasn't available this week. I pointed out it was the last item displayed on the \"today's specials \" sign positioned at front door. He gave me the lasagna at \"buy one get one free\" but the price netted out about the same. Big deal!!.                                            
Hmm, Maybe they should stick to spaghetti specials cause I was irritated after looking at my purchase. The top lasagna was perfectly made but the second was smaller with minimal sauce. Really  Babbos ? Businesses should not advertise if it's not cost effective!"}
{"text":"Glendale AND 67th location...food is good, lots of staff but service is frequently subpar. Recently my wife and I went in and were seated.  Watched 4 staff members engaged in ongoing conversation but seemed oblivious to my wife and I lay our menus down that we got from a statff member at the door, get up and walk out after being ignored for 10 minutes...I was thirsty so we left but no staff seemed to care or notice."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! As authentic as it can get! Top notch service! Ask for Dean!

We ordered the Steak and Pesto pasta and a Margherita pizza. Had to be the best steak pasta I have ever had. Thanks Dean!"}
{"text":"Babbo... This place has been on my hit-list of places to try for a long long time. Today, I finally had the chance to taste the goodness that is Babbo! Of course I had the dish most honored here on Yelp... Spaghetti and Meatballs. I ordered my food for pick up so take that into consideration. 

Let me first say that everything I heard about the bread is absolutely true! Their bread ROCKS and mixed with oil.. WOW! It's outright delicious and could have been the mean right there! BUT waited too long and I have the plate in front of me... I dive in... spaghetti cooked perfectly... sauce tastes delicious (not too think not too thin.. not too tart, not too bland)... the meatballs are not only huge but they are the meatball bomb!! Really awesome and enjoyable meal!

The only negative is that for whatever reason I did not get the dish at the $6.99 special. I was charged full price. I was going to bring it up but it's the first time I was trying this place out and I just wanted to eat! SO.. that brings me to portion size... not cool. Way too small even with the two huge meatballs. I wouldn't pay full price for that ever again.. it's simply not worth it for that little amount of food."}
{"text":"Bad lighting and we were placed right by the door that employee's use to get to the patio. A girl started cleaning it and the chemical spray engulfed our table. Service was great, but the food wasn't really impressive. I wouldn't mind coming back but not for a very long time. As in a few years long time."}
{"text":"Good food. The Italiano sandwich is my favorite. One of the few places my whole family can agree on. I almost forgot about the bread. It's amazing and served warm. Good service."}
{"text":"Met a friend for dinner at Babbo last night. Word to the wise: Mondays are busy-- it's cheap spaghetti and meatball night! This place was crawling with snowbirds!  I was told the wait for two would be 15 minutes, not a big deal at all, I don't mind waiting. Towards the end of our wait, we did notice there were many empty tables-- turns out the kitchen was a bit behind due to all of the business they were getting. Once again, this did no bother me-- we were seated probably 20 minutes after I checked in (it did take a while to get silverware, I think this is why they were not seating). The bread and dipping oil was delicious, and the food did not take long. I had the garlic shrimp linguini- it was spicy which I was not expecting but did not mind. Service was good for a busy place. I thought that the prices were good and liked my dish, so I am sure I will be back with my husband, but maybe not on a Monday!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed the food. The ambiance waz great. I'd give them a five star, but our waitress disappeared for long periods of time to take our orders for drinks and food and to bring us our food and drinks. We thought it was a bit strange. But overall, the food was worth us going back in the near future."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how phenomenal Babbo's Italian Eatery's catering has been for our wedding. Not only is the company same-sex wedding friendly, but their excellent customer service really made our wedding planning experience so much more enjoyable. When we went for our tasting, the staff was super helpful and we got to try pretty much everything on the menu (and got to take home a lot of leftovers since the servings were full size). My husband and I brought mothers along (who both have quite the picky taste pallets since they are great cooks themselves). I lost count of the number of dishes we tried, but each one of them was so tasty, it made our decision process so difficult. My husband's favorite was the Asparagus Fra Diavolo, and I loved the  Tuscan chicken and three cheese mac and cheese. During our tasting, we were given full sized portions which gave us enough or us to make the difficult to narrowing down which delicious dishes we'd like to have at our wedding. We ended up choosing 2 appetizers (pesto bruschetta and mini meatballs), 2 salads (brussel sprout and beet salad, and the Napa salad), 2 pasta dishes (Pasta Primavera and Three Cheese Mac and Cheese), 2 entrees (Asparagus Fra Diavolo and Tuscan Chicken) and a coffee bar for our wedding which gave everyone several options to choose from (even for the pickiest of eaters). At our wedding, the guests were head over heels about how the quality of the food far surpassed their expectations to the point that they even said they will visit one Babbo's many valley locations just to have their food again! We can't wait to visit Babbo's Italian eatery again and taste even more of their delicious dishes. A++ rating overall."}
{"text":"Good food, quick service and lots of menu options. Kinda slow on the drink refills, but that would be my only real complaint. If you order the Italian egg roll trio, stay away from the chicken...both the steak and Italian meats were delicious, not so much for the chicken. Portions were large."}
{"text":"Went for dinner couple of times with my friends. Nice place to have good Italian food."}
{"text":"We are pretty regular here and love the food! The gluten free options are awesome but ordering take out can be dicey as we waited a good 15 minutes later than the time promised to get our food. I would give them a better rating except for this."}
{"text":"Love coming out here for the Mac and Cheese and for the Calzone.  Doesn't hurt they have amazing bread and oil in the beginning.   No doubt this is the best Italian food in the Far East valley."}
{"text":"Unprofessional. Food is over priced. Nothing is fresh. Staff is rude. Seated quickly, only to wait 20min for service. If you want  real Italian food in this area, try Fabio on Fire."}
{"text":"Just recently stopped in for lunch. Not very busy.  Another restaurant that I want to really like but.............
Don't take forever to bring tea and soft drinks to the table. Refills bring or ask if you see empty glass.
When you serve the bread make sure its hot or warm. Bringing cold bread makes you wonder where it came from before your table got it.
When you bring oil for the bread bring small plates with you instead of the guest having to ask and then \"wait forever\" for you to bring them. This happens in every Babbo I have been to. WHY?
When your serving more than two guests bring more than one small saucer of oil.

These are common sense things that you should be doing anyway."}
{"text":"I've been coming into Babbo regularly for a couple years (I went to the Cave Creek location before this one opened), and have always been completely satisfied.

The menu is large, with plenty of pizzas and pastas to choose from.  From the pizza menu, it's hard to choose between the traditional choices like the Sicilian or meat-a-ball, and the more interesting varieties like the chicken alfredo with spaghetti baked on top of the pizza - but I think my favorite would have to be the barbecue chicken pizza.  On the pasta side of the menu, there are a couple dozen great dishes, but the new three-cheese mac and cheese with bacon and Italian sausage may just be the best thing on the menu.

Service has always been great.  Everyone is friendly, and there's a casual atmosphere that makes you feel right at home.  There seems to be a lot more \"regulars\" here than most places I go to, which says a lot about a place."}
{"text":"The food was just amazing, they use the freshest ingredients, and even with a very busy full restaurant, the food came out very quickly. I had the pleasure of speaking to the general manager Logan, he made us feel right at home. Our server was Kylen, he was very attentive and did a great job, run to this place."}
{"text":"I have ordered the mushroom asparagus penne meal at this location twice.  Each time the asparagus has been undercooked.   I don't live close and I think I will go to the Cave Creek and Tatum location from now on.  The manager Kim doesn't seem to appreciate her customers."}
{"text":"Don't order the stuffed portobello mushroom. It's literally one mushroom cap topped with marinara, cheese and sausage for $10.50, nothing stuffed about it. Won't get too deep into my experience but Take the food to go! Still leaving 5 stars cuz I don't want to bash a family restaurant."}
{"text":"Stop for lunch on Friday 9/30. Very disappointed with the food.  Had a small pizza, no flavor at all. Hardly no cheese our sauce.    Also tired the spaghetti with meatballs, it came out very hot which was good but for the price it wasn't very good. Just was very plain tasting. Very good meatballs tho.    We have eaten their before and the food was much better. Maybe it was an off day.   Wasn't happy with the lunch specials they offered."}
{"text":"Another delicious meal at Babbo's! One f my favorite spots here in Surprise, AZ. As always, the service was excellent. (Thanks Chris at the bar!) There is something for everyone on the menu and all reasonably priced. I'll have another plate of that bread, please!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Fantastic service! Awesome setting. Roasted Brussels sprouts pasta dish was fabulous. I believe Ann was our server and we loved her. We had a part of 8 and she stayed on top of it! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I enjoy their Pasta Valducci dish with sundried tomatoes, artichokes, and olives in a vodka sauce.  The focaccia bread with olive oil & vinegar is delicious.  The Babbo's Bowl O'' Bolognese is delicious (I'm vegetarian, but tried a bit of it from my significant other's dish & took the meat off).  Pasta Rustico & Drunken Shrimp was decent, although I love Pasta Valducci too much to order the Pasta Rustico again.  

Wasn't a fan of the Gorgonzola Pear pizza--it was heavily flavored with the fontina cheese.  Shrimp & crab dip was not health conscious--I would say that it was ok.  

Love their tiramisu.  Served in a large mug, this is a yummy dessert there.

Staff has always been friendly.  If you live in Marley Park, you can show your Marley Park card for a 10% discount."}
{"text":"In February,  John (Management) contacted me about my TO GO Meal and review.  He made everything right above and beyond."}
{"text":"I have only gotten take out there but overall have been very pleased.  Both the Steak' N Blue salad and the Chopped Chicken salad are good portions and if you order a large ,it definitely is enough for two people. The bread that comes with it is warm, fresh and has good flavor. Unfortunately ,more that a few times they have forgotten the extra chicken that I ordered and i was not pleased with the stuffed portobello appetizer. 

Overall, it is a good place to grab some dinner to take home."}
{"text":"The bartender on Saturday around 5pm was legit. Made every drink amazing. Really enjoyed my time at the eatery."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone into this location many times. Before I had my son, we would sit at the bar and talk to a gentleman who was just married, I don't recall his name, but he was great. Very knowledgeable about beverage, sports and remembers repeat guests! Haven't seen him in some time, sadly. 
This particular visit , last Tuesday night, was a disappointment.  We walked in and we were poorly greeting by a shy young hostess, we could barely hear what she was saying. She seems confused and looked to the manager for assistance. He was too busy on his phone to help. We asked her for a booth near the bar , and she accommodated our request and asked if we wouldn't mind waiting until they were cleaned off.  We stood up near the hostess stand for almost 10 minutes while the dirty tables sat untouched and still the manager was on his phone! 
Once we were seated our server greeted us and got our drink order. Our server was great, very attentive and professional. Don't remember his name but he was younger, tall, skinny with brown hair. My husband ordered a salad and I ordered the baked manicotti.  While sitting and waiting for our food there were many servers standing around the kitchen window having personal conversations, which I was totally ok with, until I could hear a girl cursing! I wouldn't of been surprised if the while restaurant didn't hear her as its not that big of a place. The manager didn't seem to notice as he was now SEATED AT THE BAR ON HIS PHONE. At that point a server walked up to the manager and informed him of a miscommunication with a table. He said to her \"ugh, ok, I'll be over in a minute\". As the server walked away he complained to another server that he had to deal with the problem. The server he complained to said \" I know, I don't like to bother you with my problems, I like to handle things in my own.\" This server was extremely loud and the entire time we were there was very concerned with showing his coworkers the hive of bees outside on the patio! 
The last thing that blew my mind was, the manager had asked the bartender if she was able to take some additional tables. She replied that she would rather just do the bar top as she has many martinis to make. He seemed to get frustrated with her, and walked away, without helping her. She has a half a bar of guests and I watched her make about 6 martinis.  
As a manager in the industry myself, maybe I expect a little more when being served, but, I was extremely disappointed in our expiernce and the lack of assistance from the Manager! 
The food was great, as always, but at this point I don't know if I'll return to this location."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying this place has a lot of potential. Our waitress was very accommodating and nice. I had a kale and quinoa salad with shrimp that was just ok. My husband had the Cajun jumbolya (sp?) which was good actually My daughters had pizza which was good but took forever to come out more than 40 min. Why? It's an Italian place-  the pizza should never take that long to come out. That was annoying. My husband and I were done by the time my 8&9 year olds tiny pizza came out. The waitress came out several times to say \"any minute now \"They said they were sorry that there pizza kitchen was backed up. ????? They took one pizza off the bill- Er- ya the bill was still 50$ and there was no alcohol purchased. We were there for over 2 hours everyone was tired and cranky by the time
We left- not cool 
-MAYBE I would order take out but that's about it. bread was good"}
{"text":"I just ordered take out but the Italian sandwich was awesome and the chicken chopped salad was huge."}
{"text":"We had purchased a groupon a while back and realized it was about to expire so we'd come in for dinner. We weren't expecting much since we're always seeing billboards for $5.99 pasta on Monday's and Tuesday's. How great can a place be if they sell pasta for that price? 
Well, it was amazing!!

We both ordered off the chalkboard menu, my bf got the chicken and I had the portabella mushroom. Between my margaritta, the bread, our salads and a decent size portion of dinner, I had left overs. He doesn't normally have a hard time deciding what to get but he kept flipping back and forth since there are soooo many good options. 

I'm hoping they run another groupon soon, we're coming back regardless but it would be nice to save a few dollars =)"}
{"text":"I haven't ordered a mediocre item yet. Everything is absolutely delicious. The menu has a large variety of pasta selections. The pizza is amazing. I love the bread served with balsamic and EVOO. Our waitress was friendly and the service was fantastic. I will be coming back often!"}
{"text":"The service and their food is usually fantastic. I normally get their spaghetti and meatballs on Mondays and Tuesdays, but this time I decided to try their pizza. The pizza itself was pretty good, but they put Spam (at least that is what it looked like and tasted like) on as a topping when I asked for Canadian Bacon. It was square cubes of ham. If you are a fan of Canadian Bacon, you will be disappointed. We did let the waitress know that we were given Ham or Spam instead of Canadian Bacon and she apologized, but did nothing about it."}
{"text":"Great place for the prices. Love their \"Bowl of Bolognese\".  When you are seated they bring out olive oil with balsamic vinegar on a plate with some small slices of bread that appears to be made of the same dough they use for the pizza crust. We split a Mista salad which is perfect for the 2 of us. The place is both attractive and plain at the same time. Nice decorating accents make the place look inviting right when you get in the door. Other parts of the dining room are rather plain however with plain tables and chairs. The place always looks clean however. I'd definitely return and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Ok, Xmas dinner with some friends, first timers here. It was......good. 
Had the white pizza, I gave it a solid C+. Wife had the steak salad and she enjoyed it as well.
The bread and olive oil that they bring to you is pretty much the show stealer, we asked for a couple refills throughout our meal. We also ordered the bruschetta which was also a hit.  Staff was great, and it was SUPER packed. So expect a bit of a wait. We heard a few people rave about some of the pasta dishes, so we'll definitely be back to try them. See you soon Babbo!!!"}
{"text":"We like this restaurant but today the place seems disorganized.   No one at the hostess station.   A guy was standing at the bar texting.   He finally came over and didn't apologize for being delayed.   Was not particularly friendly."}
{"text":"The food was great!!!  Service was ok...we had a new guy that was training and he was actually pretty good.  The one training him, however, wasn't the best.  But we will be back for another try for sure!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give 1/2 star, food or should I say marinara is disgusting, tastes like 3 week old garlic that has been sitting in an old fridge with no electricity. Pathetic attempt at cheese bread,  overloaded with so much green stuff that you couldn't see the cheese. Ordered pizza after that because this is not a real Italian eatery,  Should have wasted my time at olive garden for crap food. Now with that said the service is good but I would recommend Cafe Roma about 3 miles away, Italian cooks and the owners make authentic Italian dishes."}
{"text":"Simply some of the best Italian I've had in Arizona.  We were fortunate to have some Babbo's catered to our work on Saturday, and I can tell you, it was the highlight of my day.  We had a penne pasta dish with meatballs and italian sausage, a salad, and breadsticks.  The meatballs were deliciously moist and filled with spices and herbs.  Phenomenal.

I really enjoyed the salad, and the bread wasn't laden with butter like so many other garlic bread/breadsticks at most establishments.

My only question...when will the East Valley be treated to such magnificent Italian cuisine?"}
{"text":"I was fortunate to have Babbo's at work last Saturday, catered to us by a generous big-wig there. It's some of the best Italian food I've ever had. Period. The ingredients were fresh, the dishes appeared to be on the healthy side, and the flavor was marvelous. I've never had such delicious meatballs in my entire life.  I would absolutely want their food again.

My only complaint? Their east valley locations can't possibly open soon enough. I can't wait to bring my family and friends to this establishment. 5stars."}
{"text":"I've lived just a few blocks from this restaurant for 5 years.  At first, being new to Arizona, I loved this restaurant because I hate cooking for one.  The food was excellent and the service outstanding.  I often bought food To Go or had dinner there with my family who lives nearby.  We always took out-of-town family and friends to eat at Babbo because we were confident that everyone would be pleased with his or her meal.  I would have given Babbo a 5-star rating at that time.

But in the past year or so, both the food and the service have slipped considerably.  One of the biggest draws for me and my family was the bread that comes with each meal.  Suddenly, it stopped tasting as good, as if another dough mixture was being used.  The bread is included with Take Out orders but this concoction gets dry very quickly.  Before, we could enjoy our meal while it was hot and snack later on the bread and dipping oil.  Not any more! 

A few months ago, I ordered a personal (10\") pepperoni pizza To Go.  When I got home, I discovered that there was NO PEPPERONI on the pizza!  NONE!  And this is a menu item listed as \"Pepperoni Pizza\".  How does a line chef miss the critical ingredient?!   I called in and was offered a replacement but I was undressed and comfortably at home so I arranged to come for the pizza another time.  But that night I was forced to throw something together, tired and hungry.  

A week later I picked up my free pizza but was still disappointed.  The \"marinara\" sauce - what little was thrown on the icky crust - had no flavor at all.  The pizza tasted like cardboard with cheap ketchup and poker chips in the guise of pepperoni slices.  Remember, this is an ITALIAN restaurant!   Other meal items like the Firecracker Rolls just don't taste as good any more, as if the ingredients or meat vendor has been changed.  The $9 Bruschetta Trio is absolutely horrible! The ingredients had no flavor and the presentation was sloppy - making the \"appetizer\" totally unappetizing.  And the one dessert that any Italian restaurant should be able to serve with satisfaction is tiramisu.  Don't waste your time on the Babbo version!

Recently, I ordered a Pesto Primavera with chicken from the restaurant's \"Chalkboard Menu\".  Again, it was a To Go order which I picked up.  Once at home,  I could not believe that I paid $14 for a flat chicken breast mixed/topped with several vegetables in a pesto sauce and a side of mixed vegetables.  The side looked so unappetizing that I didn't even eat them.  The rest of the meal, while tasty, was about $5.99 worth of food.  I'm a small eater and a restaurant dinner usually lasts me two, sometimes three, meals.  Especially a simple chicken dinner that cost $14. 

I really like Babbo so I gave it another chance, ordering the same meal again today.  This time, I asked that they keep that nasty veg side dish -  just add more of the veg blend (Zucchini, Yellow Squash, Tomato, Mixed Peppers, Red Onion and Shaved Carrots) in with the pesto sauce.  I also requested that the shaved parmesan be substituted for gorgonzola cheese.  WELL!  First, there was NO gorgonzola at all and rather than add more of the aforementioned vegetables, the \"chef\" threw in a boatload of  red onions and green pepper slices - as if I'd be too stupid to notice.  That tells me that the zucchini, squash, etc. is not freshly prepared but comes in pre-packaged portions, likely from an outside vendor, and shipped refrigerated or frozen.  For the price, how hard is it for the restaurant to slice and dice a cup of fresh vegetables that would cost less than $5 wholesale?!?  I stopped going to national chain restaurants like Chile's and Applebee's over a decade ago for the same reason - changing a good menu into a fast food mess. 

I'm afraid to order my favorite meals - Spaghetti & Meatballs and Three Cheese Mac & Cheese.   The recipe ingredients may have been changed or substituted.  Hopefully not but I'm not willing to take that chance.

I hate to see familiar long time Babbo employees laden with a sinking ship.  But the poor food ingredients and inconsistent kitchen has lost me and my family as customers.  I had my last meal at Babbo today!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here regularly for a couple years now. The food is amazing and the staff is even better. I've only had one negative experience ever and not only did they take care of it, but they personally apologized and offered to go above and beyond for the next visit. Couldn't be happier to have this neighborhood gem. 

Oh, and the new hummus pizza is WONDERFUL."}
{"text":"So very disappointed right now! I had thought all day about the roasted brussel sprout with pancetta. Was all set to start with a pistachio mozzarella salad and was even planning on in the zeppoli to finish. None of this however actually happened. Apparently since the location change once the hostest seats you you are not acknowledged? for 15 minutes and have to stand at the bar to ask for a Manager. I wanted to let the Manager know why he would be receiving a really bad review but I have to say he didn't seem overly disappointed. So as I sit here at Oregano's writing this I am still missing the Kentucky Mule I would have ordered. I should have spent less time waiting to be acknowledged because the employees that we're very talkative with each other at their little zone where they place orders then transformed Into blank expressionless people as they walked by my table several times as if it were the DMZ. So in the end I tried to go to the less Corporate restaurant but it wasn't in the cards. A interesting side note here is that Oregano's has now been around long enough to walk right in."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch with my daughter she had the spaghetti and I had the calzone. HUGE servings! The food was good but honestly have has better Italian. Staff was great it was a good experience will come back for lunch again."}
{"text":"the food is not as good at the new place, as it was in the old resturant."}
{"text":"Awesome food- we decided to do a bunch of appetizers and split a large salad and everything was so good we are going back next week to try the pasta.  Our waiter provided great service and so glad we found this place."}
{"text":"Last Sunday I was looking forward to a good pizza.  Well, I like my crust baked.  I tell you the pizza oven apparently was not working.  My pizza dough was not baked.  Terrible experience.  Don't order pizza at this restaurant.  At $35 for lunch, for one person, no, no they will not get an opportunity to target me again."}
{"text":"My family likes the new location. We pretty much visit this place every Monday for the spaghetti and meatballs. Best deal in town. Its quite crowded on Mondays and Tuesdays because of the deal what trust me it's well worth the wait. The pesto bruschetta and the firecracker rolls are awesome. The service is excellent but overall Ann goes above and beyond. Just wish this place had more handicap parking."}
{"text":"I always enjoy dining here. The food is quite tasty and the service is good. They have a great variety of items on the menu to satisfy all taste buds."}
{"text":"Third visit to this location. We just had cocktails and appetizers. Love the bread and dipping oil/balsamic. The pistachio mozzarella was very good, and the stuffed portobello was delicious. Service was okay. Our server brought bread plates. Mine was dirty ( oily) and it took a while to get somebody's attention to bring a clean plate. The restaurant was not busy at the time (4:30 on a Thursday)."}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian food!! Great quality, large portions (leftovers hurray!), delicious bread served with balsamic and olive oil to snack on, clean and fun atmosphere. Went for my birthday and the place was slammed. Had to wait for about 20-30 mins. No wonder they are opening another location that's twice the size! Can't wait to eat there again"}
{"text":"I love this place and every time we go home to AZ to visit family we make it a point to go to dinner here.  

The bread they bring out is so yummy we always get a few plates of it.  I (being a creature of habit) always order the Chicken Lemone.  It is pasta, chicken, artichokes, capers and lemon with a lemon butter sauce.  It's soooooo yummy.  My mom always gets the drunken shrimp which she loves.  The only thing I wasn't really impressed with was the Mista Salad.  It was made with iceberg lettuce which I thought was odd and had mushrooms in it (which I love) just not your traditional Mista salad and the dressing could use a bit more flavor.  

The staff is very friendly and we have always received great service.  Would definitely recommend to friends and family and anyone visiting AZ."}
{"text":"I'm not from this area, but with a craving for Italian food I searched for pasta close to me and this place was first to show up. As usual, yelpers didn't let me down! 

Really great service by Manny (?) and fantastic food! 

My family got a selection of pastas and everyone was thrilled with their choice. The favorites were garlic chicken, spicy Alfredo, and pasta puglia.

Free bread out first was a really nice touch! We had a little too much (; 

Overall, really solid place would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"\"You didn't think you were gonna leave Hungry did you?\"
We definitely didn't.  For being our first time we had a completely Unforgettable experience. Our waitress was so informative and so helpful she helped us with a bunch of recommendations from happy hour to drink specials it feels like we indulged in a little bit of everything that the menu has to offer. The food tasted amazing and I'll definitely enjoy having leftovers for tomorrow's lunch. I definitely recommend giving it a shot. Everyone's a little Italian here."}
{"text":"I am writing this review as I suffer from food coma. I just left Babbo after chowing down a big bowl of pasta, bread and spring mix salad. Let's say my lunch meeting went by well. 

What I love about Babbo is the variety of options to choose from. If you feel like pasta one day you can grab a bowl. If you feel like pizza they have different pizzas to choose from in various different sizes. Then if you feel like salad or adding a salad they have a nice selection of salads to choose from. 

I am a boring pasta, pizza and salad person. My order looks like something you would request for your kids. I am still hooked on the traditional marinara pasta in a bowl. No meat or cheese. Just the sauce. This is the ONLY restaurant that has ever got it right and it taste good every time. The Spring Mix Salad is my absolute favorite pick on the menu. That dressing tops it off but something about the sweet golden raisins they add. The bread well that is a whole different story. I have this theory if a restaurants bread does not taste good how can the food. Babbo has mastered the bread.  Let's say you will fight over the last piece with your guest that is how good it is. They provide you with oil and vinegar to dip it that makes the bread melt in your mouth. 

I have used Babbo in the past for catering for large parties. They have never made a mistake and the food is always looks like a presentation out of a magazine. That has only helped me look good at work. Defiantly an establishment you can trust for large catering needs. 


It has been amazing watching this Italian Eatery grow. I saw this restaurant move in to my neighborhood then had a dining experience at the Women's Expo many years ago that had me sold. They have a dynamic culture which is why there service is always great. Along with a hip menu that is mighty tasty."}
{"text":"Terrible absolutely terrible ordered the chicken limone expected a chicken breast on top of noodles instead they gave me cut up little pieces of diced dry chicken looks like it came out of a can. Wife had the Italian sausage spaghetti it was a bowl of sauce with a couple noodles and 3 pieces of sausage. Service was terrible food was terrible will not go back again"}
{"text":"Another outstanding dinner.  The food was great and We got it very fast.  The managers are on top of their game there.  I highly recommend you visit them."}
{"text":"Another outstanding dinner.  The food was great and We got it very fast.  The managers are on top of their game there.  I highly recommend you visit them."}
{"text":"The only reason that this didn't get a 5/5 is because we waited 15 minutes for anyone to actually acknowledge us at our table. This happened to two other parties as well. It was a weekday and not busy at all so there's really no excuse. But the spaghetti and meatballs special is an amazing price and the food is really good!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant.  I was here two months ago while visiting family in AZ.  While our food was good here, our service was sadly lacking. The restaurant was very attractive when walking in for lunch. The restaurant was pretty large with nice dining areas and a beautiful bar. We were sat down at a table and then ordered. Our server was nice.  We were given complimentary bread upon sitting. I also ordered a garlic spread with anchovies that was fantastic.  

We all decided to go with the lunch combos. These came with an entree and salad. For my entree I got the Pasta Valducci with penne. This had Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, and pink vodka sauce. This was very tasty.  My fiance and his mom both got pizzas which they enjoyed.  At this point our lunch kinda got frustrating.  It was like our server was nowhere to be found.  My fiance and I are big beverage drinkers while eating, and we couldn't get a refill to save our lives here. We had to ask multiple times for these. When it came time for our check and for leftover pizza, we had to seek out our waiter for those and then it took quite a while to get after we asked again. I don't know if our server was new, overwhelmed, mentally checked out or what, but at that point it was pretty disappointing.  

Looking at other more recent reviews here, I would come back hoping for an overall better dining experience. We enjoyed the food here when we were here for lunch, just not too thrilled with the service."}
{"text":"This place is delicious.  The new restaurant is beautiful.  Great lemon drop martinis! Never had a bad meal or customer service."}
{"text":"This has become a consistent favorite for us since we had the baby. They are always accommodating - giving us seats in the back JUST IN CASE - and making alterations to the recipes because of my breastfeeding (TMI, I know...) The food is great. The prices are right and the chefs are really nice."}
{"text":"Visited this location for lunch today and boy was it wonderful. My Partner and I had Spaghetti and Meatballs and was very good. The bread and olive oil mix was very good as well. Our service was wonderful and staff was very friendly. This is going to be on my must eat places."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time...had some pasta dishes and an appetizer. All were tasty and nicely prepared. Service was attentive and pleasant. Very good meal and affordable too. Worth a stop if you're in the area."}
{"text":"My wife used to order takeout from this place and I thought it was pretty darn good.  The last two times I have been here were far from satisfying.  I will only review tonight's offerings...
The lady ordered some formation of pasta in a cream base with bacon and mushrooms.  All of the bacon was of the soggy, flaccid variety amount to chewing soft fat.  I actually don't mind when that happens as I will just skip past it but it grossed the lady out.  
I ordered the pasta puglia and the pasta was either ice cold or pretty hot.  Kinda reminded me of when I used to warm up leftover Olive Garden after a night of drinking in my college era.  I possibly would have sent it back but I noticed the 6 waitstaff busting out the sidework at 8:00pm.
Oh yeah, they also ran out of bread?  What?  How the hell would you have made my sandwich if I would have ordered one since that is approximately half the menu.  I'm assuming they meant the bread that is designed to bring out the table and they do not have a competent enough chef/microwavist to modify the bread selection on the fly.

Personally, I will pass.  Feel free to give them a shot on $5.99 pasta night.  Makes you feel a lot better when you spend that than when you shell out 10x that amount on a few drinks, cold food, no bread, and soggy bacon."}
{"text":"been here before. Food is great, fresh bread. But we found a piece of metal from pot and pan scrubber in the pasta n hair in the bread this time.....but the bill was taken care n we were ask to come back with a $25 gift card.  We'll come back again just hope the chef doesnt make us chef speical again.....PLZZZZZZ"}
{"text":"East Mesa Babbo's is scratching and clawing it's way back to 4 stars. 

Not quite there ... But Close!"}
{"text":"Oh man has this place taken a nose dive, what did I expect for an over expanding local franchise concept. They rob all their best people/chefs to open yet another new location, without perfecting the current locations. 

Way-to-go Babbo ... you made it ... Right to the Heart of Mediocracy! 

You can order online,  sit/stand at the ridiculous bar, or wait in line for sub-par food & service. Hell they even delved into catering food, whats next, start a culinary school. 

Well it looks like you got-er-all-figured-out. 
Guess what, so do I. 

Babbo's  ... 3 strikes, 3 Stars ... and ... your out!!!"}
{"text":"Overall great quality and service.  5 stars to manager Marcie ... As a long-term customer I find that the entire operation is much more efficient since she began.  We eat in often and also place a lot of to go orders, and a few times that to go ordering would yield errors and inefficiencies until Marcie started.  I have spoken with her and she is incredibly polite, her customer service skills are top notch... I highly recommend Babbo and thank you Marcy for caring about the patrons.  Pizzas are outstanding"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love coming here on Mondays and Tuesday's for spaghetti! The staff is always great and I would definitely recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I give the 4 stars based on their brussel sprout, beet, and goat cheese salad because it was unique and very, very good.  And, their foccicia bread that they served while waiting for our food was warm, soft and very tasty. 

However, it feels too much like a semi-fast food chain - and the others at my table didn't enjoy what they ordered.  They complained that the pizza was weak.

I'd go back, just for that salad."}
{"text":"Babbo's has been our favorite place for lunch or dinner for the past 2-3 years.  I eat a very strict diet -- no gluten or grains, no vegetable oils, no sugar -- which eliminates 95% of all restaurants for me, within our budget. 

We've been able to find delicious salads at Babbo's, and come back here as often as we can. We would eat here more often, but we struggle to close our business before 9:00pm, so we can't eat out on weekday nights. We bring guests and friends here, and recommend, for example, the chopped gorgonzola salad (sub flank steak for chicken for $1-2 extra). 

After 3 years eating at every restaurant here in our local Arrowhead area, Babbo's remains our favorite and our first recommendation."}
{"text":"We waited to have our order taken for over 20min. No one greeted us, took our order, drink order, etc.

The manager happened to walk by so I grabbed her. She said \"Oh...she must be busy with the other group\". The largest group near us was 8.  

She took our order and when the waitress showed up she explains that \" I didn't know I was still on the floor.\"  Hmmmm we were in the middle of the restaurant. She later explain is was a BIG miscommunication that involved \"4 of us\".

They offered a free desert for the experience and the wait, which took us over 20 min to get that. 

Meanwhile I went to use the restroom. I saw the girl that was our server was going into the stall next to me with a can.... Didn't think much of it. Ohhhhh I should have. 

The handle too to the stall was all wet. The toilet seat was drenched! Both covered in Lysol. I walked out to wash my hands and the garbage was already bagged up. It's 8:40 and they close at 10pm and they're running around like they need to leave.

The manager has left for the night. Of course she has.... If I were in her spot I'd run of embarrassment too! 

The food was good but service was terrible."}
{"text":"Eat here frequently both in-house and take out. The food is consistently excellent. Service and ambience is always great. Their chalk board menu is our favorite."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant that was referred to me by Mr. Jimmy J.  Love this place and so glad it's close to home.  Had the Pasta Valducci and it was very tasty!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My friend moved on to this side of town and wanted to know where we should go for her birthday. I threw out some nearby options, and mentioned this place although I hadn't been in before. 

We arrived and had a short wait. When we ordered our food, I explained to the server I was a vegan and could not have meat, dairy, etc. and was going to get a dish without the creamy alfredo sauce and wanted garlic and olive oil instead. She gave me a puzzled look and said \"that sounds kind of... gross\". 

Cool. What do you recommend instead? The options she gave were not vegan. 
We went back to the dish I originally asked for and she said \"do you want cheese on it?\" -_-
 In the end, my dish came out without- and I was happy. 

Sadly, she never came back to give us refills or offer dessert. I wasn't wowed by the service, or the food. The atmosphere wasn't too great either. A bus boy was walking around looking for things to clean and a sassy hostess walked up and literally snapped her fingers at him and pointed at a table to clean. Just kind of sad to witness as a guest."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here after a day of spring training baseball and we were indecisive on where to eat.  This was close to where we were staying and looked nice with good reviews.  Wow, I really enjoyed this place!  The service was friendly, and quite a good menu.  I decided on a pizza with meatballs on it and my friend got the pasta puglia and we shared.  The pasta puglia was AMAZING!!!  So fresh and tasty; but we got it on spagettini instead of the fusilli.  I really enjoyed the pizza too!  Good crust, not too think and the meatballs were not dried out from the oven; the garlic was a great touch!  The bread you get to start is also quite good!

I would definately return!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here on my birthday for dinner. I ordered the stuffed manicotti with no sausage (turkey is the only meat I eat). The waitress asked if I just wanted the peppers it in then and I said yes. When it came out there was meat in it and no peppers. The description of the meal in no way says there would be any other meat in it. The waitress checked and agreed, but said all their sauces have the boulenese sauce (with meat) though it states that nowhere. She said she would get a new one out in a few min. After my bf had been completely done with his meal for at least 10 min, I saw her stick her head out the door and say nope it's not out to someone and go back in. She actually came back to our table maybe 5 min or so after that and said it's still not ready and wondering what we wanted to do. I said to just cancel it, it's my bday and I was hungry and not happy at this point. She proceeded to bring the bill with a measly 20% discount on my bfs pasta and our 2 glasses of wine for \"the inconvenience\". No dessert, real apology, or anything. I didn't get to eat dinner on my bday! She also never refilled water, asked if we wanted more wine, or anything in the middle of this. Horrendous service."}
{"text":"The food quality is similar to what you would expect with a Olive Garden or a karabas however the quantity leaves much to be desired. We ordered the 3 cheese Mac and Alfredo as well as the Fire Cracker rolls for 2 people and safe to say we will be going to Wendy's about 15 min from now. (We are both average size people who have always have left overs when we have Italian food).

Just food for thought when your picking a place to eat! (Pun intended)"}
{"text":"5 Stars. 2nd time to eat here and happy with both experiences. Trust me and get the chicken parmigiana with the white sauce on the noodles. We brought my parents tonight and my dad is not a big fan of pasta and he cleaned his plate.
So good and the service was incredible."}
{"text":"I am Sad.  This is my first review after 3 trips, and I wanted to give a 5 star, but I can not.  I went on Saturday evening at 7:30-8ish with some friends.  The kitchen had a bad day, but so did the service.  It took 10 minutes to get drinks, 15 to get bread, and 30 for the appetizers. 

The Server was obviously frustrated, but after a smoke, he felt better.  The food, when it finally came, was good thankfully.  The Calzone is great and the Pasta Poolia is my fiance's favorite. 

I will go back, but service is my #1 pet peeve, and it has been spotty before, so it may take a while.  Normally, I would rate a 2 or below, but I think it was an off night, so I will update again in a few months."}
{"text":"No flavor. Lots of potential. The layout a beautiful. But I came to eat! Going to try little Sicily today instead looks like MUCH better!"}
{"text":"I first had their food at work when they catered our lunch twice. Everyone loved it. I then went to the resteraunt on a date with my wife and we loved their homemade bread. Their salad was amazing as well as their pasta. I love that they are locally owned and not a big chain resteraunt. I will be back!"}
{"text":"You made me so very happy. With my parents in tow we came to have Sunday  Family lunch. With mature minds and needs come extra wants for eating out. Thank you for accommodating us with a smile.  Often when eating out and you ask for a particular table or need , servers can be a bit sour.  But not you, you smiled, helped , moved us and brought us fresh teas immediately. 
Your food was tasty too. Just what I wanted on a Sunday afternoon with the 'rents. Fast food never looked so good , as the quickly brought out salads you served.  
I definitely want to come back, you shine as a beacon of hope for casual easting in the Northwest Valley.  Great Service , Great  Friendly Wait Staff, and Tasty Food!"}
{"text":"Babbo's has turned into my wife's favorite local restaurant. She even has them cater in food at her place of business. The first time we went there we couldn't believe the buzz of activity near this restaurant on a Monday night. I said to myself, I didn't realize how many snowbirds live in the area. Then as we entered the restaurant it was packed and there was a twenty minute wait, WHAT? Are they giving stuff away? Our waiter clued us in that it's $5.99 pasta night. Okay, so they almost are giving away stuff for free.

Everybody in the family loves the Spaghetti and Meatballs. Me, I have tried the Spaghetti and Meatballs, Chicken Parmesan and the Calzone. I thought the Spaghetti and Chicken Parmesan were good but the Calzone has excellent after I made some modifications to it.

I order the create your own Calzone with three ingredients and ask for no ricotta cheese. This has turned an okay Calzone into a superstar. So this place is easy on the wallet and the service is usually fabulous."}
{"text":"Not a good dinner here tonight. Very rushed with entre coming before salads are finished. Our second time there but there won't be a third, sorry to say. Choices of pasta have odd combinations with little care taken to season properly. Seriously-I don't know why the place was so busy. Maybe people feel it's a bargain with the large helpings.  Was hoping it would be our \"comfort \" food place."}
{"text":"Yum!  We really enjoyed our meal here and may have found our new go to for pasta.  The Brussel sprout and Pancetta pasta is fun and different.  Love the focaccia and service was excellent.  Nice, large menu selection which means we'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"The last time I was at Babbo, my younger daughter was in 7th grade. She is now in her junior year of college. The last time we were there, we were whelmed, at best - not great, not bad - just - there. 

We went back tonight for a benefit, and the food was FAR BETTER than either my wife or I remembered. The service was good, and the food was terrific. The lasagne is worth ordering (my wife had the Greek Garden Pizza).  We split a tira misu for dessert. The overall experienced was thoroughly enjoyable."}
{"text":"Obviously from the name it is Italian food, but they do it rather quickly. Our visit was on a Friday for lunch and we took advantage of the lunch specials. I had the BBQ Style Chicken pizza and my wife had Mista Salad. As usual we ate family style and shared with our daughter who just loves to watch people moving throughout the restaurant.

The food was quick and the service was very pleasant. The salad was a full serving and sharing was not a problem. The black olives were a hit for Tara, my daughter and a great hit for my wife since she loves Balsamic Vinaigrette. The combination of greens, mushrooms, mozzarella cheese and croutons makes for a refreshing salad.

The BBQ Style Chicken pizza is also big enough to share as well. Made with BBQ Sauce, Roasted Chicken, Roasted Red Onions, and Cilantro. This really hits the spot. I prefer a sweet tangy BBQ sauces over the spicy type and this one fits into my preference.

The bill came in under $20 and we kept it to an hour. We were very happy with our visit and plan to return again soon."}
{"text":"OMG. This restaurant is amazing!! It's for great pricing and the food is so fresh. I had a few lunches here with my parents, and they never let us down. It's delicious."}
{"text":"Definitely not your traditional Italian joint, but everything I've had so far is great and the staff is very personable and helpful.  The bar is good too!"}
{"text":"Service and food was great! Wanted to let the manager know how good everything was but he stayed in the kitchen or behind the bar the whole time. It would be nice if the manager made rounds occasionally to get feedback. It wasn't busy so I don't think he was needed back there. Other than that everything was great. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here. I enjoyed my dinner a lot! Ordered the Alfredo Supremo with chicken. I ate the whole dish.... which was bad because it put me into a food coma. 
The decor is nice and the service was great for us having a party of almost 20. 

I will return."}
{"text":"I have been here many times over the years. In fact, we had our office Christmas party here one year. This is a great place to meet friends for lunch or dinner. The food is fantastic! I love the pasta rustico or the pasta valducci. Yum! Also I love the spring mix salad and the zeppoli for dessert. Their bread is freshly made and delicious. I took one star away because service can be inconsistent."}
{"text":"We love this location. The $5 Monday / Tuesday spaghetti and meatballs is a local hit and always a cheap eats good idea.  You can also sign up for their mailing list and get occasional deals on that, too.

Sit at the bar - ask for Danny, he is an awesome server / bartender.  You get instant seating, instant service and they are always on top of things."}
{"text":"We decided to try this location because we were in the area and love the Babbo in the Cave Creek area so much. It was a smashing success. As with the other location, we got there early to take advantage of the happy hour and sat at the bar. 

Our bartender Andrea was phenomenal. She was very friendly and attentive.  Our food came out hot and fresh and was delicious (as always). If you're in the area, be sure to check them out."}
{"text":"Pros:
Interesting menu (especially where located)
Super flavorful dishes

Cons:
Why is my pasta always swimming in water?  Please take 1 extra minute to drain it!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Babbo in forever.
Went w family last night.
Menu has been updated and I couldn't believe 
How delicious it was!
4/2018.  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"If this place was take out only I would give it five stars.  Every time I get takeout it's ready when I get there, food is hot, and tasty.  Eat in however is another story entirely.

Last time I went I brought a coupon which stated martinis, 8\" pizzas, and appetizers $5 all day.  Limit one appetizer and drink per table.  My boyfriend and I ordered an appetizer, a pizza each, and I ordered a martini.  When I gave my coupon to the waiter he said the pizzas were considered appetizers therefore the appetizer would be full price.  No where on the coupon did it say anything about pizza being an appetizer; it actually was listed seperate.

Every other time we have gone my boyfriend has ordered a calzone.  When ordered takeout it is perfectly cooked inside and out.  When ordered to eat there though you cut in and the cheese hasn't even begun to melt in the center.  The few times he's sent it back to be heated more it comes back burnt.  He's had to learn to only eat the edges, which isn't very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Although the food is pretty decent, there were a couple things that really made our trip tonight kinda bad....the food was not served until a full hour after we sat down (we got there at 7 pm on a Friday which is peak,but then again we were seated in less than 10 min. Also, during that hour wait, couldn't help but look around and notice the     chunks of food (seriously) that laid on the floor next to tables that were recently vacated, then as tables were cleaned the food scraps were left there in plain view. Kinda nit picky I know, but also kinda disgusting."}
{"text":"Horrible, Horrible.  Arrived at approx. 11:45 am.  Seated quickly. Waiter arrived quickly and made some kind of Mexican/Black comment/joke!  We ordered.  Bread came with balsamic/oil and was great.  Food arrived within 20 minutes.  Comments from the four of us:  Mista Salad: \"Looks like leftovers from all the other salads...not crisp, soggy.\"  Spaghetti and meatballs: \"Sauce very acidic...meatballs ok.\"  Pasta Martini: \"penne VERY al dente\".  Steak Panino: \"Ribeye - where is it?  Maybe 1 oz on a HUGE Foccacia roll?  2 thin slices of mushrooms, but 1/4# peppers & bruschetta tomatoes?  Apparently someone had tried to season the sandwich and only on one site...One bite caused me to gag & drink a lot of water.  And again, almost raw pasta salad...wanted the potato chips, but the waiter said they were \"86'd\" and I assume that meant something was wrong with them.  After eating what we could, another serving person asked if we wanted boxes and the check and we replied \"yes\".  Ten minutes later, we received the check.  Another 10 minutes before someone came to get our money.  Another 10 minutes before anyone came back with our receipts.
I took my half of the steak panino home and deconstructed it thinking that maybe the majority of beef had been put on the other half of the sandwich.  NO...On this HUGE focaccia roll, there were a few pieces of beef (not big enough to pick up with a fork), two thin slices of onion and huge amounts of peppers and chopped tomatoes. So many restaurants fill your sandwiches overflowing with beef but your beef is like the old commercial \"WHERE'S THE BEEF\".   I and my friends are very disappointed in your restaurant and can't imagine returning."}
{"text":"Love the new restaurant. We love Joey he is the best server. Always yummy and great service!!"}
{"text":"Fast seating, polite staff, quick service + attention, great salads.  I also ordered the pizza for us to share and they brought it to me.  While it seemed to be a nice size, they said it was the wrong one (too small) so was free but would bring me a correct one right away.  I would never have known.
Thanks for the honesty, tipped 25%"}
{"text":"Really don't know why it took us almost four years to come back here? The food here is great! On this visit, I had the cajun jambalaya. This dish comes with chicken, sausage, onion, and peppers. It's a spicy dish but well worth it. Mama, had the pepperoni pizza. We asked for it to be crispy, I guess we need to have them burn it? Still the pizza was really good, and another dish that was spicy. Sounds like this should be a five star review, right? Well,
The hostess needs to dress better. If I wanted to see a tank top over a tube top. I would have gone to the beach. Other workers at least are running around in black t-shirts. 
FLIES, there were flies inside the restaurant. One just bugged the hell out of us. Finally at the end of our meal, I was able to smashed it. YES PETA, I killed it!
Hopefully our next visit will be sooner then four years."}
{"text":"Given the five stars from the previous poster, I suppose I should give this place another try. I went with my husband a year ago and we both were so thoroughly dissapointed that we haven't been back. I love the concept of sitting outside on the little patio while enjoying a cool glass of Pinot, a salad and some excellent convo. 

Unfortuantely, the wine was horrible (very \"inexpensive\"  tasting and it wasn't cheap in price by anymeans), the salad was SO bland that I bitched the entire way through the meal. My husband ordered Chicken Alfredo that looked and tasted as though the chef had taken pasta and tossed it with a little flour/water to get the \"creamy sauce\" and then threw in a couple pieces of chicken for effect. Seriously it was HORRIBLE. 

The waiter was attentive which I appreciated but wasn't willing to do anything in regards to our complaints on the meal. (And he ASKED us how our meal was, we didn't volunteer that we were dissatisfied) The concept of the establishment along with the ambiance (in the evening amongst the twinkling lights on the outdoors patio) was delightful. 

Unfortunately when I PAY to eat out it has to been pretty wonderful for me to want to revisit and this place just wasn't. Perhaps it has gotten better though so I would suggest you \"dine at your own risk.\""}
{"text":"This place is always busy. .  Some plates are great some so so ..  today our daughter had the mac n cheese. . None of us could stay out of her plate. I cant wait to go back to have my own... and as for our server Joe above the best...hope we see him again too. Please just get some calamari!"}
{"text":"Well... I have to say something about this place.

I must admit , I came to this restaurant about 3 days ago for the first time, and my first thought was \" this wasn't going to be good\" 

There was kids screaming and yelling in the back ect... 
this is going to be a unpleasant experience for me . 

However, the service was great. Fast pace and nice and polite, and I orded the bread sticks with the olive and balsamic vinegar.. amazing fresh taste 


As for my main plate, I ordered the Pasta Martini and it was so surprising to me , absolutely delightful..  and the price is very reasonable.. 

At the beginning I thought \"oh boy , this is gonna be bad\" then at the end I was so surprised .. very well done . 

Atmosphere needs to be worked on , but the food and service was perfect . 

I'll be returning ."}
{"text":"Although we did come at a slower time of the Saturday, service was great! He was super attentive and not overbearing. We had the kale salad which was a great size. And the bread was delicious! Music selection was nice, ambiance was comfortable and sports on all tvs. Oh and the bathrooms were very nice and clean. I would certainly come back."}
{"text":"Delicious! The hubby and I were on our way to Phoenix and took a road out of the way. We found this place on Yelp and stopped in to check it out...great choice. The restaurant was clean and simple, the service was great and the food was delicious. I ordered a small Caesar salad, an absolute favorite of mine if done right. This one was perfect. We shared the Calzone...the perfect size for two. It was made with ricotta cheese which made it even better, the taste and texture of the cheese, sausage, mushrooms was different and delicious. I would definitely recommend this yummy spot."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 4 stars if it was cleaner first Mery tried to seat us in a seat that clearly had dirty napkins and food under the table I asked if we could sit some place else so she then sat us at a table that she just cleaned but cleaned the table off on to the seat so I had to wipe it down before sitting.. boxes by restrooms looked a bit trashy , and kitchen floor was dirty food all over i guess maybe because it was toward the end of the night but really still not ok in my book .. so other then that I was pretty good and a nice looking place if they were to clean things up would be a great date night place."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this Babbo location twice. Each time the service has been outstanding. However, the food is just ok. 

Only seconds after I was seated, I was given a huge plate of bread sticks. They were delicious, and I loved the balsamic and oil dipping sauce. I ordered a glass of Sangria. I was not that impressed with it. It tasted like it had been poured directly from a bottle of the cheap Sangria that you can buy at CVS. The Caesar's salad was okay, but as I ate it I found several pieces of wilted and brown lettuce.

I went to Babbo because I was craving spaghetti and meatballs. The meatbalsl were delicious, but the tomato sauce seemed very bland. The food was not bad, but it just wasn't anything spectacular. I will say that the portion of pasta and tomato sauce was huge. I had enough left over to make two full meals. 

I would go back to Babbo, but I am more likely to go to other local Italian places like Spinato's or Oregano's instead."}
{"text":"The food is fabulous here! I had the chicken limone and it was super light and filling. Others at our table had pizza, pasta and one had a calzone. Everything was spectacular EXECPT the service. Service was more than slow, it dragged, which made our meal awkward. Drinks took forever and appetizers came out with our meal.  It would have been 5 stars if the service was better."}
{"text":"I went to Babbo's on Friday for dinner with my wife. We really enjoyed it! Very good food and service. In fact, their freshly baked bread was too good. We pigged out and had barely enough room for our entrees. I tried the Mac and Cheese (bit of a self-proclaimed connoisseur) and really enjoyed it, though it wasn't quiet as good as Noodle's Inc. in my opinion. My wife ordered spaghetti and meatballs and thought the meatballs were excellent! I'd recommend giving it a try if you're in the mood for an Italian dinner. The menu is diverse and all the items looked tempting. We can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"5.99 spaghetti and meatballs! It was a huge portion and tasty. Service was good. Its nice to have a restaurant close by that doesn't try and gouge its customers. $31 for a family of four and everyone was satisfied. 
The bread at the beginning is amazing!"}
{"text":"It's tough to impress an Italian girl with Italian food. Babbo Italian Eatery left an impression and it was \"molto bene!\" 

The ambiance at Babbo Italian Eatery was cool and urban. It's a dimly lit restaurant; one that's good by day, but I suspect better by night. They have a nice little patio which was a bit noisy (too noisy to hear my favorite band emanating through the speakers!) but that's to be expected at a busy CenPho intersection. I imagine even cool winter nights would be pleasant on the patio warmed by electric heaters. And for what it's worth (I think the ladies will back me on this one) I was very happy to notice the restroom was clean and attractive. 

I ordered the Steak and Pesto Pasta (flank steak, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes and pesto over penne and topped with shreds of Parmesan and basil.) It was colorful, flavorful and plentful...so much so I could only finish about half. It was slightly on the oily side, but that's par for the course with pesto. The meal also came with a nearly-warm herbed focaccia along with a \"not-too-heavy\" oil and \"just-the-right-amount-of-kick\" balsamic plate for dipping. 

The service was fast and friendly; the server even chatting me up for a few minutes. He's leaving Arizona soon so I hope the other servers are just as personable on my future visits. For today's visit, Babbo Italian Eatery was \"squisito\"!"}
{"text":"A nice Italian restaurant with great food and great service in a nice and convenient location.  What Moe can you ask for!"}
{"text":"I Like The Meatballs Special @6.99 it's A Awesome Value  But HH is Just Ok as Wines Are $6 Should Have Some for $4 -$5 They Would Sell More !! Serve Wine in Cups instead of Stem Ware. Not my Favorite.. Know it's fashionable (But I prefer Wine Glass) Meatballs are Tasty Great Deal. They Have $8 Pizzas On HH Special as Well. Sign Up For Email And get Offers as Well"}
{"text":"Great food. Great prices. Great experience. Their portions are great and you will definitely have leftovers for the next day. Loved the family owned atmosphere."}
{"text":"Actually the food here is quite good the bread is really yummy the Caesar salad is well done &  I am super picky when it comes to dressing. However....there always seems to be some little issue when it comes to customer service & The staff seems to be frustrated perhaps they are not getting what they need? Not sure but today I was informed that according to corporate policy??? (whatever that means) they will no longer be able to pre-mix my to-go Caesar salads that I often order so that I can eat going from my job in Carefree to my next class in Scottsdale. I order them that way because let's be honest it just doesn't turn out the same when you do it in your car. So there I have my reasons and I'm sure they have theirs but I will be taking my business to macaroni grill Bye-eeeee:)"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Highly recommend spaghetti and meatballs. Lots of flavor. Fantastic customer service. Speedy and courteous."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Came in for first time today based upon recommendation of a friend. The service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. Their fresh bread served with olive oil & balsamic vinegar is delightful. We shared an app of grilled asparagus and mushroom. The taste was incredible!  For our luncheon had the pasta and salad combo, just enough and the price was so right. We will return!"}
{"text":"Highly incompetent at this place if you're trying to get takeout. It's a shame because we've been regulars and they frequently screw up the orders. 

Called in 10 minutes ahead of time, they said it would be 20 minutes. Well almost 35 minutes later they realized they hadn't cooked one of our meals. It was 45 minutes after pick up time that I had our food. 

The food is pretty good but the incompetence outweighs any positive."}
{"text":"Affordable but food was very bland and tasteless.  We requested fresh bread to replace the burnt crispy bread brought out by the server."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing. Their bread and marinara are perfect. Fair pricing and a really nice ambience. Better than the Italian chains and its local and family owned!"}
{"text":"WOW - this place is really cool. Wouldn't expect from where it is located. 

The food is EXCELLENT. My wife had pasta, my one kid had Spaghetti, and me and my other kid split a Calzone. I tasted all of them -- and they were all good. 

The bread is what makes this place (I am a bread lover) - quality and service only adds to the great experience."}
{"text":"Had a few people suggest I check it out since it's right down the street. Pretty standard. I was really hoping for food that popped. We had a spicy penne which wasn't anything to write about so I won't. We ordered spaghetti and meatballs for the little one and he was fine with it. Also had a pesto pasta with chicken. Once again it was kinda flat. We didn't finish because it was kinda boring. The garlic bread was alright but yada yada yada I want food with flavor. Maybe I'll ask for that the next time we stop in if we do."}
{"text":"I just love this place with the food, ambiance and service. Usually I sit down and eat but I did their carry out service this time. They were great on the phone and when I went there the food was ready and still hot. I got the spaghetti special with meatballs and it was excellent. I highly recommend this place for anyone and especially Monday and Tuesday night with their spaghetti special"}
{"text":"Great local restaurant that you can have a casual dinner or celebrate a special occasion. It is great they also hire local kids to work there. We are lucky to have such a nice neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"This certainly isn't the classy looking restaurant shown on the website.  Surprise is smaller, much brighter and noisy!

But the food was delicious.  Three Cheeses Mac and Cheese was wonderful  And my wife loved the Pomodoro Pasta.  She requested lots of capers, and she got it (fifty cents extra).
Nothing fancy - no veal, darn it - but lots of different pastas and salads.  You could go for a month and never have the same dish.  As another reviewer said, a nice little local joint."}
{"text":"Yes, I've experienced better.  Much better.  Many times.

Don't get me wrong, it isn't BAD.  It's fine.  Especially when they have a promo and you get the entree for $7 instead of $13.50.  Which we did.  For $7 it's OK.  For $13.50 I would be very unhappy.

The special was their chicken parmesan.  A standard dish in most Italian restaurants.  One knows what to expect.  Well, what we got were two relatively small strips of chicken on a bed of pasta.  They had been breaded and fried (I don't think they baked them, but I suppose it's possible).  Which is fine.  Except they were overcooked.  Not moist at all.  And where one would expect melted cheese and sauce on this...well, that's not how they did it.  They put sauce on it (which is fine) and then shavings of cheese.  So you have these shavings of cheese which fall off your fork as you're trying to eat because they aren't melted into the dish.  It might look nice when they bring it out, but from a flavor standpoint you're not getting cheese in most of your bites.  Most of my cheese ended up in the pasta that remained after I had finished the chicken.  The sauce was OK.  Nothing spectacular, but it was fine.

Also, usually I would have leftover to take home.  As I get older I find I eat a lot less than I did when I was in my 20s.  So usually I end up taking half my entree home with me.  But not here.  I finished it.  Now I will grant that I was ready to stop when there were perhaps two bites of pasta left so I just finished it since that wasn't enough to bother packing.  So I did leave 'full'.  But this tells me the portion size is a bit small.  And, as I said earlier, for $13.50 I would have been annoyed with that, especially given the overall quality of the dish (which was average, at best).

I signed up for their email club while we were waiting for our food.  But I doubt I will utilize any coupons they send me.  There are too many good options out there to spend my money here.

Service was very good, though.  The server was cheerful and sufficiently attentive."}
{"text":"We ate there last night and had a wonderful evening.  Our server recommended the chicken Parm and I loved it.  She was on the ball and never asked for a refill.  Ask for Marie when you eat there. A fine dining experience for a casual restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a toss up between 3 stars and 4 stars. Food would be a solid . However, this is the second visit where communication errors on their part kind of messed up our evening plans. We had plans to meet some clients/friends for dinner. I called ahead and asked about reservations or call ahead seating. Their hostess explained they offered call ahead seating for parties smaller than 6. Approx 15-20 minutes prior to our arrival, I called and spoke to a man and told him to add us to the call ahead list, that we would be there in about 15 minutes. Upon arrival, I went and checked in with the hostess, but she stated she didn't have us on the call ahead list. Someone forgot to add us when we called. She then told us she would add us to the list but our wait would be 20-30 minutes. Parties that arrived after us (and our call ahead) were being seated, so I inquired with the hostess as to why. She told me we were now next to be seated. After telling them twice we had a party of four, they then tried to seat for a party of two. They got that piece remedied and were seated with our clients and spoke for a few minutes. After 8 minutes our waiter finally came to take our drink order. We asked him to add an appetizer as well. About 10 minutes later he brought our drinks and asked if we were ready to order (we had been ready for a few minutes) but suggested that we \"hurry\" to get the order in as another large party would be ordering and might push our wait time back. We put in our order, since we had already been waiting to order anyhow. Approx 15 minutes went by without drink refills and now our food was coming to the table. The appetizer we ordered got \"lost\", so that ended up coming several minutes after dinner arrived.  The manager came to the table to apologize for the lost food. She offered to comp the appetizer, which we appreciated (since we didn't end up eating it anyhow.) We explained to her the comedy of errors we had encountered through the visit. This was the second visit in a row we had an appetizer go MIA and be comp'd for us. While the seating issue was below average and having to wait a little longer for drinks and service than usual, the wait staff was kind and responsive to our requests. The manager was apologetic for issues we had. The food was very good, as usual. If you reserve or use call ahead, it might be worth a call back while you are en route, just to confirm you are on the list, and your party size."}
{"text":"Stopped in at lunch time yesterday on a whim as we were hungry and needed to kill some time.

I found the restaurant to be busy with the working lunch crowd and a few families also in place.

Unfortunately, I found our service to be ill-paced considering we each ordered a salad which came after others around us, whom ordered after we did.

Salads arrived and were adequate, again however our Server seemed to be overwhelmed by her surroundings and didn't pay adequate attention to us.

That said, I would come back once again and see how dinner goes, but unless you're part of the working lunch crowd, I would consider staying away during that time."}
{"text":"Wait was horrible....service was ok.....don't order a margarita because you won't get tequila in it....they have a 2 oz company policy of tequila.  The food took long and was just ok.  Lastly our bill was $65 and the waitress asked if we wanted change off a 100 dollar bill....yeah because this service earned a 35 dollar tip NOT!"}
{"text":"I've been to both the Arrowhead and Surprise locations of Babbos, and the Surprise location ALWAYS takes care of us when my coworkers and I come here for lunch. We at least come here almost once-twice a week. They have great lunch specials - personal pizza with salad or pasta with salad. The servers know we are on a time crunch the minute we walk in and they work hard to get us our food and get us out on time. 
My go to lunch special is the margherita pizza with the spring mix salad. If I'm craving pasta instead for lunch, then I go with the Rustico pasta. The Rustico reminds me of a baked ziti. It has a thick red tomato based sauce with basil (I think) and it's covered with a thick mixture of rich cheeses. 
They always serve bread with olive oil and vinegar while you wait for your salads and food in general. The garlic paste, which is basically a garlic hummus, is only $2 and it's great for dipping the freshly baked bread sticks in. 
When I pick up dinner on the way home, my favorite is the drunken shrimp pasta. The shrimp is marinated in lime juice and tequila and you can taste the buttery richness of the pasta when it's all mixed together! I have a friend who always orders the mac and cheese because it's not your average mac and cheese. It has three types of cheese and bacon and sausage mixed in. My husband always orders the italian sausage pasta, which you can guess it also delicious. There's such a variety of pasta. You just can't go wrong with coming here. If you want to feel like a warrior, eat one of the calzones by yourself without taking it home."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! We were staying at the nearby Squaw Peak Hilton and looking for a good place to eat. We read the good reviews on Yelp so decided to take a chance and are so glad we did! The food was fantastic, and the service was impeccable. They had a wide variety of options to choose from too, which was great for our large group including pizzas, pasta, chicken dishes, seafood -- and the fresh bread was to die for! And all at a pretty reasonable price. Definitely go!"}
{"text":"The employees are very friendly and accommodating and the food is delicious!

We love this place! The roasted beet & brussel sprout salad is so good that we find ourselves craving it routinely (sans cheese, obviously)!

They are very happy to answer my questions on ingredients, omit cheese & other items from predetermined dishes and even substitute extra items (like pine nuts) at no cost. Very vegan friendly establishment!

Other food that we enjoy there: The pizza crust bread (vegan), pasta primavera using either a garlic olive oil sauce or a marinara sauce, with pine nuts added. 

If you're looking for some tasty Italian food and excellent service, check out Babbo."}
{"text":"I often tend to agree with Melissa H's reviews, some of which have led me to try some good places. But I gotta go the other way on this one. Babbo is one of those franchise places that I like to describe as eyetalian. Its way too safe and unauthentic to satisfy the urge for Italian food. Uninspired, to put it another way. The Creamy Garlic Chicken is a messy, drab confabulation. The Stuffed Manicotti is generic Costco stuff, the sausage Putanesca and Drunken Shrimp only slightly more exciting. Don't get me started on the awful pizza. Yechhhh.
The spaghetti specials are a good value, i guess, and the service has been good the three times I ate here.  To be honest, many of our friends really like Babbo, so I tag along.  But when its my choice, we go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Huge selection of different pastas and the food was terrific in quality.  We went there twice and both times had great meals.  Always busy and runs a lot of specials during the week.  Portions are ample and the service was polite and quick.  Can eat inside or out, but it is a little noisy inside.  Anytime we feel like Italian food, you can't beat this place."}
{"text":"Ok. so on the west side, people wait for hours (every night of the week) for f*ing olive garden. Are you kidding me? Come on people, if you want crappy Italian food check out the freezer section at Fry's. No waiting! 

So in that context, Babbo is really good. Cute little place in a strip wall (this is the west side after all). The food is comfort food. Nothing creative or fancy, just big portions and tasty food. 

We had the salad, pesto bruschetta, pizza and the tiramisu. Everything was pretty good (not if you are on a diet...or a pseduo diet like I am). 

Great service. Our waitress rocked. And she offered tasting of several wines so we could make our choice. Nice touch. It is amazing how good service can make a place shine. 

Anyway, I will go back.  Nice to see a good place in the 623."}
{"text":"This place is an incredible well-kept secret, until now. As good as any Italian restaurant anywhere. Unpretentious, inexpensive, awesome happy hours, unbelievable shrimp fra diavolo pasta dish. Also, I don't know who the bartender is or even WHERE he/she is, but that person makes some of the best and BIGGEST happy hour $5 martinis I've ever seen. Did I say inexpensive? Incredibly inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Delicious Italian family fare in a comfortable friendly atmosphere, who could ask for more?!  We were in a mood for good Italian food and Babbo's did not fail to deliver.

My husband had his usual pepperoni pizza, which he thoroughly enjoyed.  I decided to select from their \"chalk board menu\" where patrons can mix and match combinations of protein, vegetables, type of preparation.  I loved my meal of roasted chicken, prepared with tomatoes, basil and feta.  Lively tastes coupled with roasted cauliflower, broccoli & carrots.  The only average part of the meal was the side Ceasar salad.  

The waitress took great care of us; very attentive and polite.  She returned to the table several times to make sure we had what we needed. 

We will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"Review for pasta take-out. . .   DON'T
DO IT.  We normally order pizza or calzone which is good for Arizona.  Tonight we decided to try their pasta.  Appetizers were Crustini with Pesto and Italian Egg Rolls.  Crustini was not, They just dolloped cheese and pesto on an sliced Italian roll and melted the cheese.  Every other Crustini that I've had they toast the roll first, add cheese or whatever and then melted the cheese.  I can melt cheese on a roll in our mic'.  The Egg rolls, waaaaay over fried, black in spots.  OK, so you really need to try to screw-up spaghetti and meatballs, ta-da, they did it.  Pasta was overcooked mush, blah sauce.  Martini Sauce, we were thinking sort of Vodka Sauce, nope.  Tasteless too, with an odd surprise.  Full of chicken, oh, that should be on the Pasta Francese.  Oops again.   Order was in early, restaurant was almost empty.  Still managed to FUBAR the order.  Stick to the Pizza or Calzone.  Pasta order was wasted money."}
{"text":"I had the pasta rustico which tasted like straight up tomato sauce out of a can, could have used any kind of seasoning, very bland. The fresh bread is excellent. My boyfriend had the mac n cheese which he loved but I was not very happy with my pasta."}
{"text":"Great food! Mon and tues they have a spaghetti and meatball special that you can't beat, just be sure to go early as it's sometime hard to get a table"}
{"text":"Went to Babbo for the first time on my birthday, 02-01-17, with my boyfriend and four children under 8 years old. This was a Wednesday night, and the place was very busy...good sign! Although the restaurant was full, we waited only a few minutes to be seated. (We had to ask for an extra chair, even though the booth side of our table was clearly way too small to fit half of our party.) The kids loved their food, as did we. Service was a little bit slow, but hey they were busy! Zeke was our server and we paid using gift cards. When the receipts were returned to us, we noticed no signature was required and were trying to hustle four children out of their seats in an orderly fashion. It wasn't until the next morning we realized we did not leave a tip! We both work in food service and were appalled at our negligence. I immediately called the restaurant to apologize and ensure that I would bring Zeke his tip. The hostess who answered my call was extremely kind and lifted my guilt significantly...I only wish I remembered her name. She is great example of an employee you want to represent the face of your company ( She was taking calls on Thurs. 02-02-17 in the morning, in case the employer would like to recognize her excellent service). I didn't make it in until the following afternoon, but I wrote him a note and included a generous tip to make up for the belated gratuity. The MOD was not polite, nor did she seem to care that we were trying to make up for our forgetfulness. This made me feel bad, but otherwise our experience was delightful."}
{"text":"The service here was friendly and prompt making my family's visit pleasant. We all had the same spaghetti and meatballs dish for dinner. As for my thoughts on the dish: The sauce was wonderful and seasoned very well as for the pasta it was cooked perfectly. Now for why it didn't get a five star rating, (the meatballs) the meatballs had too much filler instead of meat & the half a meatball I was able to eat actually sat in my stomach like a rock. Would I bring my friends here when they come to Arizona, probably not. But I am a cook and make this kind of thing at home from scratch so take any criticism I give with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"Last night was pretty much a disaster not because it was \"spaghetti & meatballs\" night but because of the hostess and the general manager allow a \"guest with 8 people\" with no prior reservation just go up to the podium and empede in on the line because the old gentleman man says to everyone \"all you have to do is drop my name and you get a table just like that\". Not to mention over hearing the hostess and manager say clearly \"for parties with 6 people or more you need to call 24hrs in advance because they DO NOT ACCEPT same day reservations or call ahead seating\". I'm guessing grandpa must have missed that memo, but what pisses me off more is there's about 40 + people waiting for a table and they just up and get this party a table mind you that most of us had been waiting over 35mins to nearly an hour, WTF seriously you have to be fkng kidding me. Not mention they change the entire pasta menu with some healthy shit and take off the good plates for healthy shit. I'm really not impressed now it's just an overrated restaurant with over priced plates and worst is my pasta dish was so oily last night I haven't stopped shitting this morning and I've been up with diarrhea since 4am and few moments ago I've thrown up yes oily pasta with green beans and prosciutto, hate to be disgusting but the service and the food was much more disgusting than I can ever be..I won't be back thanks for ruining fine dining."}
{"text":"The chipotle chicken and pasta rustica are two of my favorites! Great fresh food and service!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here.  Always fresh great tasting foods.  Waiter always very helpful.  Just a great place to go go.   And on Monday & Tuesday 2 large Meatballs and spagetti for 6.99 with fresh made bread.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. 

The lunch special is delicious and the waiter was excellent and the manager was great.

Is that vague enough?  :-)"}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying Babbo changed my life. Well maybe not to that extent but it did change how I see Italian restaurants and it will be hard for any to compare (unless of course they are in Italy). We went here for my bro-in-law's birthday dinner. They gave us our drinks right away. The next thing I knew they brought out this AMAZING pull apart warm flat bread that you dip in olive oil. It was to die for and we kept getting more.  My dad got the spaghetti and meatballs, I got the chicken fetticine, sis and mom got the spicy mac n cheese, and the birthday boy got a buffalo chick flatbread. All of it was amazing. I had a piece of meatball though and it was so yummy I am def. getting that next time. All meals were very reasonably priced and our server was great! I plan on going back super soon!"}
{"text":"Great little Italian eatery in Surprise! I had the Chicken Chipotle which was incredible. So many flavors! Unbelievably inexpensive. Very friendly wait staff, full of recommendations and smiles. We sat outside which was very intimate and quiet and clean!"}
{"text":"After reading a very positive newspaper review of this local chain my wife and I decided to try it.  Since we live in central Mesa the trip to this location on the very eastern edge of Mesa on the border with Apache Junction is a bit of an effort.  We went for lunch with another couple and sat outside.  The menu is extensive but consists primarily of various pasta plates and pizzas.  Imagine my surprise to find that this Italian restaurant offers no lasagne, ravioli, veal or chicken parmasan, or saltambucca.  Hmmmm.  Our server, who indicated she was fairly new, seemed somewhat overwhelmed.  As a member of the younger generation every time we thanked her for something we got the standard under 25 response:\"No problem.\"  Really?  I don't normally think of asking for a to-go box as a problem.  Anyway, After she took our order we did not see her again until she came to bring the check; our lunches were delivered by a man who I believe was the manager.  One plate of pasta went back immediately because it was barely warm.  My wife's pizza was good, my manicotti was OK, the other two penne pasta lunch specials were just OK, too.  With tip, lunch for two came to a little over $30; seems a bit high for what we got.  I doubt if we would make the long drive to this restaurant a second time.  It would be difficult to recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tonight I was very disappointed in Babbo Italian Eatery Arrowhead.  I placed my order online at 1:00 in the afternoon because I knew they would be busy and it allowed me to choose a pickup time.  I decided to pick up dinner for Valentines Day at 5:10.  When I arrived my order was not ready yet.  It was not actually ready until 5:30.  You would think placing your order 4 hours in advance would make it on time.  Then I arrived home and began to set out my dinner and realized the dessert was not in the bag.  I decided to call and see if I could go back.  You would expect the manager to say no problem.  Well I called and was placed on hold twice for 8 minutes, then was told the take out time was 2 hours so it would be that long to get my dessert or she could put it in the comp book for my next visit, before I could respond she put me on hold again and said she was getting a manager.  I thought great the manager will take care of it.  Instead the manager offered to give me two desserts the next time I am in.  I asked if I could come in and get it in about an hour.  The manager responded negatively and was trying to get me to decide to get it another time until i finally said i would like to come in and get it in an hour.  She said she would put it in now because she didn't know how long it would take so it might be ready before I get there or after I get there.  When I arrived I was asked to pay for the dessert I had already paid for again.  I know it is Valentines Day, but if you can't handle the crowd then they need to do a limited menu on holidays so they can still be productive. Not sure I will ever return."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very family friendly ad the prices are great.  Lots of choices and tasty too.  Definitely have to come back and order something new."}
{"text":"Called in and made a reservation for father's day. Told them we were specifically going to order the lasagna and asked them if they could put the order in before we came since we know the lasagna takes awhile to cook. We were told just to order it when we come in.
When we came in we were told they were out of lasagna. ????? It was 5pm on fathers day, we called in specifically stating we were going to order it and they said they were out for the day. Ok. The service was below average as well. The blonde had a gross looking sparkly booklet she wrote down with and she didn't refill our waters often enough with only two tables inside."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! My cousin and my best friend (see above review) went here tonight and had such a wonderful dining experience! 

I think they hooked us right from the start. Our waitress brought out fresh, warm bread with a balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil dipping sauce... oh my! I knew I was going to eat waaayyyyy too much, but I didn't even care! We were trying to pick which pasta we wanted (such a large variety) and everyone was so happy with their selection when the entrees came out (but of course, mine was the best.) Try the Supremo Alfredo with shrimp next time you stop in! We also had a chocolate chunk cookie (with ice cream) for dessert and that was unbelievably delicious.

As much as I love their food, the service was even better. Our waitress, Jessica, was just a ball of sunshine. She was so so soooo sweet and constantly checked on us and made sure we were okay. Craig, our bartender, was just as amazing! He is so funny and such a delight to be around! 

I have cravings for Italian food ALL the time, but we always went to different Italian spots... never again! Best service and food I've had in a loooong time! 5 stars any day!"}
{"text":"Great place. Just get a video of them saying half price happy hour drinks because they didn't give me half price. I'm not deaf. Chicken salad is great."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this location. When they first opened, I worked nearby, and would eat here multiple times a week. 

Stopped in tonight for a meal and the quality of the food seems to have gone down hill. The pasta dishes were bland and the kids pizzas were burnt to a crisp. When a six and ten year old who love pizza won't eat it you know something's not right. 

I frequently visit the Arrowhead location and the food there is much better. 

I'll probably give them another chance. But seeing how empty the restaurant was on Friday night at 7pm may be a sign that this might now be normal."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!!  Gorgonzola spinach cream pasta......a great salad and the little one had the alfredo-fettucini....yumo!

Good service and a very convenient location!!!  God bless the entrepreneurs  that make dinner happen at 8 o'clock at night for guys like me.     Give Babbo a try....I hear their pizza's are excellent!"}
{"text":"Just had our first Babbo experience - Sunday night takeout.  It was excellent! Good sized portions, fresh, great flavors, and prepared just as we'd asked.  And they couldn't have been any more friendly! Delicious - we most defintely recommend."}
{"text":"Really like the Babbo chains a lot! Especially this location since its in my area. I have tried a couple dished at this restaurant. My favorite is the garlic chicken pasta for sure! I've also tried the cheese manicoti, which was very delicious as well. Tuesdays I used to come here for the spaghetti and meatball special. I am not sure if they still do that or not. However it used to be the highlight of my Tuesday nights. 

The atmosphere is very settle and calm. It has a really nice authentic Italian feel to it. When you get seated they will bring out this amazing bread and vinegar/ old for dipping. I can't wait to visit this spot again for the garlic chicken pasta my fav!"}
{"text":"The food was decent and came out fast. Beer taps we're down, which isn't the end of the world, but considering how long this place has been open I don't feel it should be experiencing problems like this yet/already... Also, don't give out a tap list if it isn't an option."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of an upscale restaurant in Vegas. The decor is big, monochrome, and simple. The menus IS HUGE, it took me and my family about 15 minutes to finally decide on what we were ordering. The kids menu had some of the best choices I have ever seen. We ordered the bruchetta and it was soooooo good, probably some of the best I have ever had. I got the goat cheese, spicy meatball, and a mozzarella one. Then they bring out THE BREAD, this bread is sooooooo simple but soooo good (I think we went through 3 loaves). After we were stuffed with all the bread and appetizers, our meals came. We got a thin crust spicy sausage pizza, and a roasted pancetta brussel sprouts pasta. Both were knock your socks off good. My kids ordered the mac and cheese, and even that was amazing. Overall a great experience and great food, my only gripe was the prices. Our family of 4 was nearly $100 (2 kids meals, 2 adult meals, 1 appetizer. 4 drinks and 1 cocktail) so this is a once in a blue moon kind of meal for us. But a great experience none the less."}
{"text":"Ever since I met my significant other I have been hearing rave reviews about Babbo.  He absolutely loves the sandwiches and craves them often enough to peel himself away from the pool and drive across town for Saturday afternoon lunch take-out.  

I have only been once and had a really great experience.  We sat outside on a beautiful day enjoying delicious food and great conversation.  If I could change one thing, I would place Babbo in a location overlooking something better than a sea of compact cars.

Great place for outdoor lunch, great service, great food!"}
{"text":"I really like that this place is always busy, but not busy enough for the staff to accommodate you. Every time I've eaten here I've gotten excellent service... and food! 

I've mostly tried their pasta dishes and haven't disappointed with any of them so far. If I'm on a (rare) healthy kick I'll order their flank steak salad, which is still awesome. Also love their Italian sodas - Hurricane is my fave. 

This is my new place to go for Italian and a definite must-try!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! My party of three asked for a booth, which was being cleaned. We were standing four feet from the hostess and she sat the party that came in after us at a four-top. They, apparently, were unhappy with that and came up to complain and the hostess sat there at the booth we were going told would be ours. Her explanation was that \"another booth would open soon, as a they were just served their check...\" We asked for the manager. It was quite obvious he did not want to talk to us. We had to walk back to the bar and seek him out. He seemed befuddled and confused. After we explained what had occurred he stated that he had been upfront and they had called our name, which was a complete fabrication. The entry is very small, barely enough room for six people and there were only 3 of us waiting, no one else. The hostess counter is right there. It would not be necessary for any name to be called. The manager was never in front , or even on the floor. It was very upsetting for my sister, who is a regular. She will never return. I give it one star because it looked clean and it was open..."}
{"text":"This is the worst Italian food I truly think I've ever been served. I am insulted that I left them with the $50.00 I paid, for the meal that was placed in front of me. This place is right around the corner from our house so we thought we'd give it a try. 
They were really busy when we got there, which I took as a good sign. We sat at the bar and had a drink while ordering our meals. I ordered the Parmesan Chicken and my husband ordered the Garlic Mushroom chicken. 1 hour later, our food was finally brought out. It was hot, and looked appealing. It all went downhill when we tasted our food. My husbands chicken was SO BLAND, you can tell they used frozen chicken, defrosted it, and boiled it..( there were absolutely no grill marks or browning anywhere on the chicken), very disappointing. My chicken was not much better, you can just taste the difference in fresh chicken and the flash frozen chicken that comes in 10lb bags... Yuck. The most shocking thing was the flavor of the marinara sauce on my pasta... I'm telling you, it was the WORST I have EVER tasted!! A bottle of Ragu would have tasted better.. And it had this layer of grease floating on the top of it... Lots of grease.. Seeing how my chicken was so dry I would have welcomed a bit of grease just to moisten it up a bit.... I'm still puzzled as to where that amount of grease came from?? There was no meat in the marinara sauce... Hmmmm. I am happy to wait 1hr for a great meal, with fresh ingredients. But NOT for food of this quality! I will NEVER give my money or time to this place again! I would have received a faster and higher quality meal at the Wendy's next door. I'm not sure where all these 4 and 5 star reviews are coming from... Don't be fooled, and DONT order the Parmesan chicken or Garlic Mushroom Chicken if you do take the risk and spend your time and money here! Yuck!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places.  I have had many, many of the items and have never been disappointed.  My favorite thing is the salads.  So many wonderful ingredients.  Such as goat cheese, beets, asparagus, roasted brussel sprouts, kale , red quinoa.  Oh my.  seriously this is only a few.  a small $8.50 is usually enough for me to have lunch the next day.  One of the few places that even when it is busy and full it is not too loud to enjoy.  Thank you Mr. Pollack for creating a wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Good gluten free options.  Had the roasted brussel sprouts with zoodles and italian sausage.  Food and beverages both came out promptly."}
{"text":"Stopped in while on vacation and staying at the Hilton Resort on the corner. We truly loved every thing we tried. 

We sat at the bar since it was very busy inside and there was room. The bartender was super friendly and took care of anything we needed while still running the rest of the bar and making drinks for the servers. Did really well!

We started out with some fresh bread with oil and vinegar. This bread was AMAZING so soft, fresh, warm, and just made you want keep eating it non-stop. 

The appetizers we ordered were the Toasted Italian Bread, Garlic, Mozzarella, Romano Cheese, Side of Marinara and the limited time only Panko Breaded Mozza Balls. The garlic cheese bread was with marinara was to die for.

However, the star of the appetizers was the Panko Crusted Mozza Balls!!! These are two LARGE balls of mozzarella coated in panko break crumbs and deep fried. These area INCREDIBLE!!!! Them come with a meat marinara sauce and it a great match. These are a limited time item STOP READING THIS AND GO GET THEM!

Ok now that's over if you have the strength to continue it's main course time. I decide to go traditional with Spaghetti & Meatballs Marinara Sauce, Meatballs, Parmesan, Oregano, Basil. Served on Spaghettini. This was an extremely well prepared dish and the meatballs had great flavor. The Spaghettini pasta has a little different texture if you have not tried it before. Its a little dense but tasty.

My wife had the Italian Sausage Pasta Marinara Sauce, Spicy Italian Sausage, Mixed Peppers, Mushrooms, Marsala Wine, Parmesan Cheese. Served on Penne. The sausage is actually pretty spicy and my wife enjoys spicy food and she even was a little surprised. The dish had great flavor with the sausage and pepper blend.

The deserts were the reason for going with four stars instead of five. 

We each got a dessert to go and I tried the Chocolate Torte. It was not bad a bit of chocolate overload for sure. Very rich and not something I recommend to eat all at once. There was a strange after taste from the caramel mixed in as well.

The Tiramisu was absolutely disgusting! DO NOT ORDER the Tiramisu. We have both enjoyed this style dish all over the country and this was gross. I hate to be so rude about it but I have to be honest. It was runny, soupy, and just tasted horrible! 

Overall with the exception of the deserts we did have a great dinner. I would still recommend coming here if you get the chance. Just steer clear of these two deserts"}
{"text":"Lunch special is the best deal.  Pizza with Salad or Pasta with Salad.  You should defintely try their Mista Salad and their penne pasta with asparagus and white sauce, it's delicious.  Their pizza is also good, my choice is the margherita.  Service is good."}
{"text":"Had great service last night, the bread and balsamic to dip in is awesome. I  had the new chicken parmigiana and it was great, will be back many more times."}
{"text":"I was too tired to cook and I wanted to have spaghetti and meatballs so I decided to give Babbo a try...

I ordered take out online. I ordered Garlic Cheese Crostini appetizer ($6.95), a child's spaghetti and meatball with milk ($6.00), an adult spaghetti and meatballs (online $10.95 but only $5.95 when I picked it up) and a side salad ($3.95). Total bill was roughly $26.00. It was ready by the time I got there in 15 minutes so that was good. They gave me the discount price on the adult meal, so that was good. I thought the crostini was rather bland. The spaghetti sauce was not my favorite, but the meatballs were really tasty. I grew up in an Italian family, so I know tasty balls of meat! My salad was okay. I ended up getting too much balsamic vinegar on it so all I tasted was vinegar, but it looked good before that happened. I would say the biggest issue was that they did not give me the milk that was ordered with the kids meal.

All in all, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't outstanding either. I would probably try it again in the hopes I found a dish I really liked."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy!  When it's busy it's really loud though. Food and service is on point"}
{"text":"Second visit.  Service still so-so, but the server did do me a favor when I wanted something light for dinner.  I added shrimp to the brussel sprouts salad.  Toe-wiggling yummy!  

Place was not as clean as my last visit, there was something smeary and crummy on the table and when I told our server, she ran a damp cloth over, sending crumbs into our laps.  Ick!  

But for the Roasted Brussel Sprout and Beet salad (now with addition of shrimp), I'll be back.  But maybe I'll try take-away next time."}
{"text":"I give this place a 3 because it took forever to get our food. we waited over an hour and we only had 4 people in our party. the food was very good and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Alright, my first confession is this. I've been here twice and the Surprise store once. I've ordered the same thing each time, I am THAT impressed with it! Lest you think it's but a shallow sampling of one dish, LOL, I have also tasted three different versions of their thin-crust pizza ordered by co-diners, and three or four of their appetizers. All simply delicious, w/o equivocation. 

So, what do I get? The menu choices are just shy of the Cheesecake Factory. Nearly overwhelming, LOL. Turn to the very back, they call it the 'chalkboard menu'. You pick either a chicken breast, or a portabello cap. Then you pick from a selection of about six different methods of preparation, and you pick a salad which will accompany it. I get mine with a melange of roasted beets, cauliflower, broccoli, etc. I believe the salad is 'misto' (for mixed). 
There is no pasta involved with any choice, here, which makes it easier on the belly. Plus, it allows me to splurge a bit on the 'breadsticks'. This is their pizza crust, with appropriate oil and spices for dipping. 

Give them a shot!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant and the food is so great! i brought my grandma here and she's from california and she LOVED it! the hospitality was excellent. very nice and cozy feel to the place."}
{"text":"The meatballs from this place are amazing...The tuesday special got me here, now I come whenever because I love the place"}
{"text":"I came here the other day because I love Italian food and I had to get some. Anyway I ordered lasagna, something basic to see how good this place was, and it was absolutely great and the ingredients also pretty good. I would defiantly bring some friends here for Italian food because it's one of my favorites and I'll continue to come back to Babbos!"}
{"text":"We came for the food and comfort of a local place, service was slow and lacking to say the least, food was warm not hot and not up to previous visits"}
{"text":"Came here with some co workers and enjoyed the lunch!
The bread that was served was really fresh and soft served warm and it was so good.

Food did take a little longer then expected but came out hot and fresh.
The waitress we had didn't give her name but she was very good and had a nice welcoming smile.

I will come here again!"}
{"text":"Spaghetti you won't forgetti?  Personally, I think it's spaghetti I ought to forgetti.  The Spaghetti with meatballs was not very impressive.  The meatballs are a bit dry and the sauce is lack-luster.  I also got a different spaghetti dish with seafood and a white-wine sauce.  While it was decent, it was just a bit light.

On the other hand, this place makes good bruchetta and the table bread is not bad either.

I'm not sure if I just came on an off night, since there are quite a few good reviews on Yelp, but I'm not a huge fan of this shop.  (There was also only one other table seated other than our table, which gave the place a sort of lonely atmosphere.)"}
{"text":"Great food. Love the special
On Monday and Tuesday. 5.99 spaghetti and two huge yummie meatballs. The bread is sooooo good. A weekly thing for us."}
{"text":"Great service.. We had the special spaghetti dinner for 5.99 on tues .. It was delicious and had two huge meatballs.. The bread before the dinner was so good and plentiful.. We really enjoyed dinner there.. They have so much to choose from and if the rest is as good as the spajetti this will be our italian food restaurant going forward."}
{"text":"Went to this location to meet up with friends for dinner. Seated fairly quickly and friendly fast service. Lots of things to choose from the menu both drinks and food. Decided to order from \"Chalkboard Menu\": roasted chicken with Marsala wild mushrooms and Mista salad. Everything was good except the chicken texture was odd. Had sips of my friends' peach bellini and 007, they were great. Hoping that it was just a one time thing with the chicken. Will be back to this restaurant just maybe not this particular location."}
{"text":"Appropriately priced entrees and decent sized portions. This place is a wonderful neighborhood Italian joint. We were very happy with our appetizers and entrees, service was good. We will be back!

Why patronize nasty Americanized Italian chains  like Olive Garden when you have a cute neighborhood place like this to support?"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in awhile but I love that it's in our neighborhood. Service was great. Food was pretty good but I have to say I did not like the flavor or texture of the chicken in my pasta. I ate a few pieces and non were good. Maybe it was a one time thing so I will give it another try. I do love that bread is served before the meal. Wish however a small Italian salad was included with entrees. My kids were happy with their food though my son wished his chicken tenders came with fries or a side. He wanted another flavor to accompany his meal."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favorite places. But a few off nights, cold food, raw veggies, mistakes on order and some under cooked chicken has changed my opinion. I tried several times, thinking it would be better. Tonight was pretty much my last try. Party of 4, drink order wrong 2 times. It was tea and soft drinks. Food was either so hot you burned your mouth or cold  (pizza)., the worst was the noise.  It was like a bad bar. People talking so loud and yelling you could not hear your own conversation. There was  one large group of about 8 but other tables were having to yell to be heard over everyone else. Felt like I was at Texas Road House!  My head hurt and my throat from just trying to talk over the level of noise. Horrible!   Needless to say.. A once nice neighborhood restaurant with really tasty food has changed for the worse."}
{"text":"I was at a Bridal fair last month when I sampled some pasta from Babbos Italian Eatery. The sample was god enough to peak my interest so we came here for a casual Saturday lunch. I had the lunch combo (for $9) it included a side salad and a personal pizza. I got the Mista salad which had a ton of deliciousness; mixed greens, mushrooms, olives, pepperocini, mozzarella and balsamic vinaigrette. It was a big portion size for a side salad. For the pizza I had the Bianca pizza which had ricotta cheese (one of my favorites), tomatoes, spinach and rosemary. I love Bianca pizza but some places make it greasy or put some crazy white sauce on it. This bianca pizza was delicious. This is a great deal for lunch because I barely ate my pizza so it was like having 2 meals for 1. The staff was very friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back to for lunch or to try one of calzones."}
{"text":"Bright shiny built from the ground up. Nice place for families looking for average Italian food at a decent price.
Love the look of this place and they have plenty of parking. It may be what your looking for. Maybe."}
{"text":"Friendly servers. Great atmosphere. Only downside is that when they are in their busy hours orders seem to be messed up or food doesn't taste as good as usual."}
{"text":"I love spaghetti and meatballs. I love bread and oil dip stuff. I love pasta in general. 

I cannot stand being charged over $10 for 2 meatballs, sauce and noodles. REALLY
No matter how good the price should be much less. 

I would have preferred the kids portion but the server balked at me for ordering it. So now I doubt I would be back. 

I had S.A.M.B the meat balls were good, not mushy not over firm not over spiced etc. The sauce was good nothing special. The noodles were noodles. 

The service was fine. Nothing great noting horrible. 

The kids ate their meals but neither of them were over excited to go back."}
{"text":"Freaking loved the entire meal.. spaghetti and meatballs ...simple and perfect. 

The meatball was not a pile of mush like so many other places. The pasta was cooked correctly and there was flavor to the sauce. Weird right?

The free bread and attentive service made this a great lunch. 

PS I think the pasta was like 6 bucks."}
{"text":"Here is the perfect example of a good restaurant.  This is the \"benchmark\" in my eyes...

Atmosphere - Good
Food - Good
Portions - Good
Service - Good
Variety - Good
Wait times - Good
Wine Selection - Good
Prices - Good
Convenient to my house - Good.

All aspects are \"good\" and consistently so.  This is a great place to go when you are hungry and don't want to gamble.  Meeting Friends? Go here, they have something for every one and no one can complain later.

I think it's always great to know where the hottest place in town is, but you also need that ace in the hole every once in a while and that's the beauty of Babbo!"}
{"text":"We usually eat there every Monday. I used to get the spaghetti and meatballs special, but got kind of bored with it. The mac and cheese is great; the best pizza is the mushroom/sausage/pepperoni.

I was very disappointed with the manicotti when I ordered it. And the buffalo chicken \"sandwich\" is interesting, almost like a flatbread taco."}
{"text":"Solid pasta with a good vibing ambiance. Had the chicken chipotle pasta and it was tasty and a bit spicy. Over all a good experience."}
{"text":"First, the good. The decor was very nice.

That's about where the positives ended. 

First, I don't like television, and I don't want to have to watch it when I'm out dining. Fortunately, I was able to find a table where I could position myself so I wasn't looking at a TV  - but only because my wife and I arrived before the lunch crowd. Had we arrived 15 minutes later, we might have been stuck looking at a TV.

We were greeted by a waitress or hostess who was very pleasant, and let us choose our table. Our waitress was nice, and smiled, which is more than I can say for the rest of the staff. One gentleman, who might have been the manager, was slow to smile and gave the impression waiting on customers was a burden, rather than his reason for being there. I observed as he stood behind the host/hostess stand and watched a woman struggle to get her husband, who was in a wheelchair, through the door, followed by another gentleman with a walker. The manager didn't volunteer to hold the door or do anything else to help these folks enter the restaurant.

I have a pet peeve about restaurants who give you a knife and fork (or forks) wrapped in a napkin and don't give you a spoon. What - spoons are too expensive? When I ordered hot tea, it came without a spoon so I had to stir it with my fork. My wife ordered an Arnold Palmer and had to use her knife to stir in the sugar.

The table had a jar of shake-on parmesan cheese - not fresh. This is NOT good for an \"Italian Eatery.\"

Now for the food. We started with the Pistachio Mozzarella. It was a VERY generous serving - a huge plate filled with six servings. Sadly, we only ate two because it was bland. If it hadn't been for the generous amounts of balsamic reduction, it would have had no flavor at all. And I didn't see any olive oil as in the description.

My wife ordered the spaghetti with meatballs. She asked if she could substitute capellini for the spaghetti, and was informed the restaurant does not have capellini. Again, NOT GOOD for an Italian Eatery. When it arrived, the marinara sauce was runny, and the meatballs were warm, not hot. It was about as \"meh\" as spaghetti can get. (Wait for it... NOT GOOD FOR AN ITALIAN EATERY.)

I had the Chicken Limone Pasta. To their credit, the spiral pasta was cooked al dente. But it was described as roasted chicken breast, and the chicken didn't come whole - it was cubed. And the chicken was rubbery. I couldn't find the capers they said were in it. Again, it was \"meh\" and not particularly flavorful without being thoroughly dosed with the thawed-out frozen parmesan from the jar on the table.

We won't be back to this \"Italian Eatery.\""}
{"text":"I had dinner here not too long ago. I only been to this place a couple of times . The food is okay nothing special. The service is good and everyone is friendly . It's a little expensive. My favorite thing about this restaurant is their chicken Alfredo ."}
{"text":"This was the 3rd time I have been here.  The 1st time I had their lunch special.  The 2nd time I had the jumbalya (it was horrible).  I went today and I had the Italian sausage and peppers.  It tasted like they use bottled sauce.  It was not good and that was it.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"This is our \"Goto \" restaurant!! Have been to this location numerous times in the 4+ years of living in A J . Have Never had a bad dining experience! Clean ., Friendly ., prices are reasonable and the food is OUTSTANDING!! 
The waitstaff provides a very enjoyable dining experience!! Recommend highly for any special occasion meals or just a night out! Definitely a spot to take your out of town visitors , business associates, friends and family. Beautiful outside area to enjoy your meal by the fireplace . Will definitely continue to frequent and recommend!"}
{"text":"I had the Spinach Gorgonzola Shrimp Pasta - very good. Wife had the Mushroom-Sausage and Pepperoni Calzone - very impressive on delivery! Also good."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night with our 4 kids for a quick bite. They were friendly, service was fast,  food was good, and bathrooms were immaculate. What more could you want? I'm suprised they weren't busier. I hope they get busier because they deserve it. Kids had mac and cheese (real mac and cheese) and a personal pizza which was huge and will make great leftovers."}
{"text":"It was my first time to order from here. It turned out to be amazing. I absolutely satisfied. I had Tiramisu and Calzones. They were really good. My sisters loved them."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after bragging about the one near Arrowhead.. food was good but the very bad service basically ruined the meal.. ordered the brussel sprout beet salad with dressing on the side.. no dressing.. had to flag someone down..  could not get more coffee.. had to continually flag someone down to get something.. and it was an early lunch so there were very few people there.. Waitress was not attentive at all in my opinion.. a side note.. . I do not think it is sanitary to leave plates of bread uncovered out on tables in the patio area with no one seated there.. gross. That may save the servers time but not healthy.."}
{"text":"Three of us came in for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. It was not crazy busy. The food was 5 stars. The ambiance is not romantic, but the place is decorated well and is very clean. The biggest problem I had was the service we received. The waitperson came to the table about 5 minutes after we were seated, which is perfectly acceptable. He took my sister and brothers drink orders which consisted only of water. I asked to see a wine list, which to be honest, in an Italian restaurant, should have been on the table already. Not sure if it was an oversight, but I've been to Italy, and the wine list is front and center. Soooo, after about 10 minutes, the waitperson brought my siblings water, brought me the wine list, took our food orders, and my wine selection. The next visit to the table, in about 5 minutes, we received bread and oil, which by the way, is deelish. Still no wine on the table after having been seated for about 20 minutes. In my opinion, it is a major faux pas to put food down in front of anyone at an Italian restaurant without the wine being on the table. I am not trying to be snobby, rude, or difficult, it's just that I, as well as many of my friends, like to enjoy our food WITH our wine. I'm not talking about a few minutes here, I reached the point after 25 minutes, that I headed to the bar to pay there for a glass. Entrees came and I then got my glass of wine. I don't know if this is a training issue or not, but I am a very close friend of a fourth generation Italian who operates a restaurant in my hometown back in New England specializing in rustic cuisine from the Northern part of Italy. All of his staff is trained in the importance of having people's wine of choice on the table at the time the first course arrives. I will wait a reasonable amount of time for my apps, bread, first course as long as my wine comes with it. I will definitely be back to Babbo because of the food and overall ambiance, but hopefully management will read this and take the appropriate steps to insure against this being a regular occurrence. I do like the fact also, that management is interested enough in patrons feedback that they take the time to read the reviews."}
{"text":"Went there with a client/friend the other evening.   It was rather noisy and busy and he thought we'd go somewhere else if we wanted to hold a conversation and actually hear each other.  After visiting the nearby Sprouts and doing a little shopping, he decided, nahhh.   Let's go to Babbo after all.

I was starving, so that was fine with me.   First I had to check out the bar menu.   What??  Tito's martini, $9??   I am so there!  Told the server how I wanted it:   shaken with ice, no vermouth, in a martini glass.   Perfecto!   As we perused the menu, we snacked on the warm bread (Yes, bread.  Remember?   I was starving!!) dipped in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  We both ordered the Pomodoro Tomato.   I thought it was some kind of salad, like with lettuce, but I was informed, no, it was a tomato with mozzarella cheese, just like the menu says, with virgin oil, sea salt, and basil.  Huhhh?   He's Italian.   Therefore, he explained it to me.   Yummmmm!!   I wouldn't mind making that myself.   In fact, I think I shall for the next luncheon or dinner party I have.  

I had the Great White Buffalo and he had the Babbo's Bowl O' Bolognese.   My pasta came with two big pieces of chicken.  Very creamy and tasty with the Gorgonzola Sauce.   It seemed rather paste like, as though there was maybe flour used.   I think it could have done away with that, albeit it was good.

Even though he professed not to be hungry, he did down his Bolognese and pronounced it to be very good.   I guess he was hungrier than he thought.

I would go back.   It is conveniently located.  The drink prices were perfect.   The service was friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I love going to this place on Mondays & Tuesdays for the Spaghetti & Meatball Special. It's $5.99 for delicious spaghetti & meatball with complimentary bread and olive oil/balsamic vinegar. I usually order takeout via phone, and everything is ready for pick-up in less than 15 minutes. If you're planning to dine in on Monday or Tuesday, it's best to come early since it gets pretty busy; there might be a wait."}
{"text":"Food was tasty but only a little warmer than room temp."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this place, especially since the other reviews are so good. Here's my experience..

The Good: 
Super friendly servers. 
The bread is awesome. 

The Bad:
It took forever for us to be greeted. By forever, And by forever, I mean a good 7-9 minutes. The restaurant clearly wasn't busy and there were servers standing at the bar just talking. 
I ordered a beer and my husband ordered a soft drink. His came quickly, and again, mine took forever. Again, at the very least 5 minutes. We could see the bar area from where we were seated and clearly, no one was busy. Why did it take so long? I can understand waiting if they were busy, but there were maybe 5 tables max. 
I had the pasta and salad lunch special. Mista salad was ok. Asparagus and mushroom pasta was terrible. The garlic sauce tasted like burnt flour, the asparagus was teeny tiny, and the mushrooms were super thin. Not good at all. 
My husband ordered the stuffed canneloni. Two small pieces of stuffed pasta drenched in a mediocre marinara sauce. 

All for the price of $33.00. Needless to say, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Came in last night for a late night take out order was greeted by a girl up front who directed me to the counter. A manager came up and greeted me and asked me how my day was while they bagged up my food when I got home I was very pleased to find that they included bread and oil with their take out orders because it's the best. I have had great experiences dining in before and glad to see the same goes for their take out! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I found a Italian restaurant in Chandler, where I had the BEST Mac and Cheese ever! It had a little kick to it but it was amazing!  So I don't suggest it for children. It was made with the perfect amount of chicken and sausage and creamy cheese. The croutons added a nice crunch to the dish. The atmosphere is very inviting. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill in the last couple of years. This is the second time in the last month we've come in and we have placed our order, waited then had them come say they were out of crispy chicken & flat iron steak. This time the waitress misheard my husband's bar order and argued about it when we told her that's not what he ordered. This will be the last time we visit."}
{"text":"I've only experienced takeout so far. Exceptional quality! Neatly prepared and delicious entrees. Once again, Yelp reviewers and recommendations do not disappoint. Their bread/focaccia appetizer is so good! Served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Our favorite way to enjoy a delicious bread. Everyone seemed to really enjoy each of their dishes. I should have written the review more promptly after my visit, to recall the names of each dish. Photos will have to do. Portions were just fine. I even had enough for a second meal. 

Only dish that didn't meet our expectations was the Alfredo I tried for my son. It seemed a little dry and not as flavorful as he would have liked. Will try their meat sauce or marinara spaghetti for him the next time.

Look forward to returning the next time I pass through Arizona."}
{"text":"So this little place is just precious, the staff is always friendly! My favorite bartender Rafael ,and the Manager Angel are always great! But today a newly promoted employee Jeremy really impressed me. He was so kind to an elderly gentleman who was asking all kind of questions he really did know about, but went out of his way to find the answers. It may seem like a small thing, but these kind of things are hard to come by these days! Thanks again to all of you."}
{"text":"A little curious as to why this place has the positive reviews that it does. Tried it when it first opened, but thought it was just opening jitters. Been open for a while now, and it didn't get any better.  Our waiter had zero personality, seemed completely unhappy to be there.   Glass of wine took 10 min to get to the table, and they weren't that busy.  Food was average, had the spicy sausage.  Sausage was good, but sauce and pasta was bland at best.  Pricing was fair, but seems a bit high for essentially fast food served in a nice bowl."}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing menu, amazing flavors.  Love this place!  I didn't have high expectations at first because I know this is a chain restaurant but I was very impressed.  Will come again!"}
{"text":"Food is good! Just the wait for the food....ugh....we waited 45 minutes and that was just for lunch. The wait staff wasn't very pleasant either, they acted like they weren't very pleased to be there. May try it for happy hour next time but won't be doing lunch here again."}
{"text":"We really like Babbo's. The food is always pretty good, the service is usually great (sometimes are slower than others), and the prices and drinks are decent. Not a lot of good choices in the far east valley, so when we find one we like, we tend to be frequent visitors, and Babbo's has a great variety, clean atmosphere, and great staff. Warning: they serve their bread and olive oil with vinegar. If you're like me and don't care for vinegar, make sure to ask for oil only. :)"}
{"text":"I came here just after the weekday lunch rush on my lunch break. I am always looking for new places to try, especially Italian and this is not too far from work. I honestly thought it was a fast casual kind of place but it's a sit down restaurant. Service was slow; it took a long time for someone to come up to the host stand to seat me, yes I came alone. After being seated, it took almost 15 minutes for someone to take my drink order. I was told bread was on its way but I never got it. It looked really good though because every other table around me had bread. I went with the $9 lunch special, which is a salad and pasta (select menu). My Caesar salad was very good but was hoping to be offered fresh cracked pepper, which didn't happen. I waited about 15 minutes for my pasta after I finished the salad. Pasta portion was perfect for lunch. As a tip, if you want to add meat, you're looking at $4.25 for chicken, more for seafood. I just got the pasta without the meat. My waitress really wasn't attentive and had to ask another waitress for a drink refill. She did, however, get me a to-go drink. I don't know if she's new but she seemed very nervous and jittery. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my food just not the service. I would probably come again but order it to go or even try another location."}
{"text":"First timer! 
I had the creamy mushroom & asparagus pasta added with shrimp pretty good. On the other hand we had to wait a really long time for what....pasta because it was backed up in the kitchen this place isn't even that big!! Now the bad thing is I work in the restaurant business (sous chef) this was a bad experience and waitress needed alil more training (lil unprofessional.) Maybe one day we will be back until then..not any time soon."}
{"text":"I drove from Scottsdale to meet friends visiting the area. I thought this would be good as there was a half hour wait. We sat on the patio and ordered 2 pizzas and 2 chicken caesar salads. the pizza was very so-so, dough not very good and the salads were over loaded with dressing and about three small pieces of chicken. very so-so, OK experience and good service but there is better in the valley. I picked this place based on the 4 star rating on yelp but there are much better places in this valley. Two stars is a gift."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice now... food has been excellent both times. The Mozz Ball app is FANTASTIC I would come back just for that."}
{"text":"I have had some of Babbo's pasta takeout in the past but the wife an I decided to stop in for a pizza the other night since we hadn't actually eaten there before. We got a large margarita pizza and an Italian sub. 

The pizza crust was a little on the chewy side and the sauce was very mild. The pizza was actually a little bit better cold the next day. 
The Italian sandwich was good. There bread is soft and yummy. I was impressed that the ham seemed to be more like a ham steak or a piece from a spiral cut ham. It was very tasty. 

The service was ok. We went a while with empty glasses and had to flag down a server walking buy for refills since ours seemed to vanish. 

We liked it but it's not a place would could crave to go back for but we will go back again some time for some pasta."}
{"text":"Tried this place today. Very good. Ordered the Italian sandwich excellent the pasta salad side was great. Good experience. Priced ok. Good and friendly service."}
{"text":"Do you love a good white cheese sauce that has been separated into a dry yet oily mess because it has been microwaved? Then feel free to waste your money by ordering the Brussel sprout and pancetta pasta. Absolutely disgusting! Couldn't find the pancetta, sprouts were raw and the plate was swimming in an oily mess. This was my second and definately my last visit to this establishment. My first visit was just as bad. ZERO STARS."}
{"text":"Bring a book to read while you wait for your food to come. A pillow might come in handy also."}
{"text":"Nice average Italian restaurant
Dishes are huge ,..
Had them make me the stake salad twice 
After the first time wasn't medium ( more like well well done ) 
Friendly team 
Overall very clean and quite"}
{"text":"Mediocre food. I had \"grilled\" chicken added to my pasta. It tasted like freezer-burnt chicken that had been defrosted in a microwave. However, the sauce and penne pasta were pretty decent. We went our whole meal with empty cups and never offered a drink refill."}
{"text":"Nice place in the NW valley.  Has a mom and pop feel to it.

Food is better than the Garden of Olives or the Grilled Mac joint.

Staff is friendly and the food has been consistent.

One can order online and pick up later.

Price is just north of the actual value.  All in a great place for a local meal."}
{"text":"We spent over $100 in take out, then decided to stay and dine in one of their booths. There was literally 4 other couples and 20+ tables available. Then the manager told us we could not sit at the booth and moved all 4 of us to a small table stating \"we need to save the booth for larger parties. What??!!! It seats 4 and we have 4!!!! Manager was very unprofessional and never apologized for being so rude to us. 
Don't go here! Spend your money in another establishment that truly appreciates your business.
I later complained to corporate with a copy of our receipt and the manager at the same facility apologized and would send us a gift certificate for $100..... well needless to say, she NEVER DID! They lost my business and will never recommend this establishment to any of my family or friends! Oreganos is 2 blocks south, cheaper, better food and excellent service in a relaxed atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I'm so stoked about this new Babbo location and let me tell you it's the fanciest one yet! I noticed they have a private room where you could hold a party! This casual Italian joint is relaxed and delicious. I had the steak and blue salad but subbed the blue cheese for mozzarella (win) The steak is shaved, plentiful and so good. Also tried the chicken parm dish. I loved how the chicken was served not drenched in marinara sauce- a fun twist which made it more crispy. They have their own wine brand- the Pinot noir was not bad. Beer selection is ok with several drafts available. You've made it this far in the review and now I'll tell you the best part about Babbo... THE BREAD. Omg it is good. Served warm with oregano/onion/ salt seasoning with a plate of oil and balsamic for dipping. Dangerously good and served promptly to sitting. Yum."}
{"text":"Food was alright but my pizza was cold. Service completely sucked both times I went in there."}
{"text":"The meatball sandwich thingy, in a pizza dough bun is freakin AMAZING, the onion bread with olive oil and balsamic is freaking AMAZING! The pastas are not amazing :(.  The service is always so warm and friendly!"}
{"text":"Cave Creek location 8:30 PM 4/26/2018 I wanted to get Lasagna. Would take 25 min to cook so they they didn't want to cook it, takes to long. Stuffy place, arrogant. I've gone multiple times in 2 Years. Not much out here. Same old thing. I'm pretty sure it's related to race. Sad. I will not be going back! I will also tell my friends my experiences. New location, no way. I saw how they treated their staff of color. Disappointing! The food is not worth the experience."}
{"text":"Must try the spaghetti and meatballs they are fenomenal! Seasoned to perfection, great sauce..highly recommend it! Panceta and Brussel spouts pasta was also a great plate. Ambiance is very modern casual...will visit again."}
{"text":"Service was great. Quality food cooked fresh. I had the Bianca pizza, which was delicious."}
{"text":"First time here. Started with focaccia bread with oil and balsamic vinegar. The bread is fresh baked and very good. Next was the Caesar side salad.  The dressing has just a bit of zip to it. 

Next we had traditional thin crust pizza.  Pepperoni sausage and mushroom. Fresh ingredients and served piping hot. Our friends had the meatball and garlic with fresh basil. Couldn't rave enough. 

The menu is extensive. And judging by the other diners there wasn't a bad dish served. The pasta servings are generous. 

Our server was very friendly and very timely.  Overall experience was very good."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a long time. We had attentive service and loved the new space. Even better than both was the amazing food. My mom and I shared Mozza Balls and we each had a salad. I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite to eat that is home made fresh in a casual dining atmosphere. The meat ball sandwiches and spaghetti is yummy and special salads (I love the brussel sprout and beat salad) are wonderful.
Not to be missed on your way up Cave Creek Road and points north! Prices are very reasonable for so much flavor!"}
{"text":"The food was great for the price. Upscale pizza. Their asparagus and mushroom appetizer was fantastic as soon as I added some balsamic vinegar. Their bread is wonderful and every person in the front of the house was smiling and ready to serve. Great management. Please comment and follow me for more reviews!"}
{"text":"Jessica was very professional and accommodating. Food and service is superb.
Nice ambiance and patio area."}
{"text":"So, this place is fine.  The food was great.  I had the limone chicken which was fantastic (except for it should have been served with angel hair pasta or anything other than fusilli).  The bread was delicious as was the olive oil and vinegar.  My husband's steak salad was great, and the meatballs with the spaghetti were HUGE!  Why not more  stars, you ask? The hostess was a bitch.  Straight-up - cranky bitch.  Our waitress, not much better.  She seemed bothered by our order, and this is absolutely a \"turn and burn\" establishment.  It is also loud, really loud.  Delicious food in a compromising environment.  Price is right - worth a try.  I would add this as a tip but cant because I am not on my phone -  do call ahead seating!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful! They don't take reservations, but accept \"call aheads\". They have a
great outdoor seating area (when the weather is cooler)."}
{"text":"We love Babbo. We love the complimentary bread and oil, the extensive menu and the quality of the food. It's one of our go to spots for a casual mid week date and to split a sizeable portion of salad and pasta. I can't say it enough, the soft warm bread is addicting."}
{"text":"M and I stopped in for lunch today.  The set up reminded me of a CPK.  The server was awesome...  He was there checking and making sure everything is good.  I like!

I order the creamy garlic chicken pasta (Roasted chicken, creamy garlic sauce, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes served on penne).  Very good.  And the portion is fairly large.  I should NOT have tried to eat all of it.  Now, I can bearly type or think (FOOD COMA).  

It is Friday and what the hey, I ordered a Dreamsicle (A dreamy orange cream soda mixed with sprite, mandarin-orange &vanilla syrups, and a splash of cream.).  It was good....

They also serve a complentary bread (warm, sliced, garlic, & red onions).  I do not know if we were hungry or it was GOOD, we had a second plate.  LOL!  We dipped the bread into the olive oil and balsamic vinegar mix.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, awesome food, and awesome environment!
We had a party of 18 on a Saturday night.  With our big group we had 1 server, he did a great job and taking care of us.  

I got the Creamy Garlic Chicken, my favie!"}
{"text":"We Often Frequent the Surprise location, and have been to this location a few times before meeting friends and family for dinner.  Up to this point service has been consistent.  So when some friends that just got back into town asked us to meet them for dinner here we didn't think we were in for any surprises. As usual our server was prompt and attentive, unfortunately when the food came I can't say the same.  Two out of the Four of our party had ordered calzones, we got our food and started eating.  The other calzone had the wrong ingredients and had to be remade, but by the time the remake made it out to us it was cold.  Mine was missing an ingredient and also contained uncooked mushrooms, which if you eat mushrooms you understand the world of difference in texture and flavor from cooked to uncooked.  In the end our server and the manager apologized multiple times for the food and explained they have a new chef.  She also comped one of the calzones and comped a dessert too which will make me come back.

I like Babbo and know what they can do, I just might stick to the surprise location for a short time after this.

Kudos to the manager and our server for at least being consistent."}
{"text":"A nice change in pace when you get tired of the OG and Carraba's, the appetizers are tasty recommend the pesto bruchetta or the baked ravioli, the sauce is loaded with italian sausage and at times I find myself just eating the sauce with a fork, I'm a big fan of their calzone's lots of cheese, ample toppings puff's up like a good calzone should, the wait staff has been agreeable the times we've been there though we more often than not take out. I've also had the pizza and some pasta dishes and have been pleased with most, as I recall the sauces for one of the sausage and vodka sauce pasta's is \"very spicy\" and i'm not one to shy away from spicy food, so just a warning.

a good choice for italian in surprise"}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**

Great family place with a warm welcome. Also a great place to host parties - they have a party room in the back. Almost everything on the menu can be made vegetarian, so extra points for this! 

Complimentary: Warm bread and oil
The bread is so delicious that you don't need to order anything else. 

Lunch: Neapolitan Thin Crust Pizza
Delicious! The regular pizza is more of a hand-toss, but equally delicious. 

Overall, they were very quick for lunch (we were in an and out within an hour). I highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place immensely and come in regularly. The have a happy hour 3-6ish.  I have a hard time scoring things a 5 star especially chain restaurants, so with many salads and better food than I would have expected, a 4 is ALMOST perfect.

Small outdoor seating area that I enjoy and parking can be a little bit challenging."}
{"text":"Went there last night.  Bread is amazing and the service is top notch!  The food is fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"My husband and son eat here often and brought me here for lunch.  Beautiful, tasty and huge calzone that I split with my husband.  My son loves pesto and always get a regular pesto with spaghetti and meatballs and decided to be different with creamy pesto today - I think his favorite now!  Great service and atmosphere! Sat outside today with a nice breeze and enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"This was my husband and my first time visiting this wonderful Italian eatery. We were dining with a group of friends and we were seated in the back in a cozy area near the kitchen. 
The food was fresh, hot and delicious. I ordered the personal pizza called Bianco. It was loaded with mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and fresh basil with Italian seasoning.
My husband ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were huge and the sauce was fresh with the right amount of seasoning. I had ice tea and my husband had ice water. To finish it off we had cheesecake with strawberry sauce on the side. It was decadent and the slice was enormous--perfect for two people to share.
The service was excellent.... our waitress was efficient, kind and fast. The staff at this location is marvelous. We thoroughly enjoyed the good food and the company of our friends. We will be back sometime in the near future."}
{"text":"Probably our favorite Italian food around here. Portion size is good, food is great and the environment is family friendly. We love it!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was really great here, the restaurant was not to big, but big enough for bigger party's. I'm pretty fast at knowing what I want, and our waitress was very fast about taking our order. My partner ordered the Mac and cheese and I think it was the best I've had! Very different . Although I don't think I'll be ordering my dish again, I will be coming back. 
I only give three stars because the waitress dropped one of our dishes and didn't really apologize about it. She was great though."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service, atmosphere lacks an Italian feel.  I went here on Sunday evening.  Its not a large restaurant, its clean and well lit.  First though walking in was though it was modern and minimalist.  Didn't speak Italian to me, so I figured would wait for the food.  Our first round of drinks was a little watered down, but didn't mention anything as my blue mojito seemed removed from the world of Italy.  When they brought the food, though it spoke wonderful Italian.  We had the aspargus with parmesan and mushrooms to start.  I am no fan of mushrooms, but these were great.  Buttery, not too chewy, and just right.  My ex and I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  Portions were just right and the sauce was perfect, not too thick and perfect in its tomatoess.  Food was brought out fairly quickly.  I look forward to coming again, my only impression leaving was with the interior, it felt kind of like the Pei Wei of Italian, just lacking the red trademark Pei Wei lighting.  Maybe they can substitute yello or blue and make it trade mark Babbo."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! SO happy they opened a location here! Their bread alone (which they serve complimentary) is enough to bring me back. Their portions are very large and everything is made fresh - not frozen - which you can taste the difference. Definitely stop in and give them a try!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the quick service and amazing food. The sauce though! Wow that sauce! Ask for the spiciest sauce you can get! Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Went there with co-workers for a birthday, so pretty much it wasn't my choice. Therefore I must say that I was extremely surprised they had vegan options other than salad and pasta with tomatoes! Italian restaurants are not known for being flamboyant vegans lol. It was quite good actually. I had the Chalkboard menu with portobello. I give 4 stars so they can improve on that. Service was a little slow but otherwise, everything was a-ok."}
{"text":"Danni the bartender is amazing she knows her guest ,always asks about my day, remembers my order, she is a keeper."}
{"text":"Yesterday, it was my birthday and I had been wanting to try this place out so me and my family went to dinner here. Horrible mistake. Service was very poor. Waiter's was Eric, and he was almost never around. Asked for refills, never got them. Also, by the time we were done and I got my desert, he didn't bother to clean the dirty dishes off the table and we had to put them away ourselves at an empty table. At the end, we asked for more bread to go home and he gave us it to go and it wasn't cut or seasoned!!! Food was also very mediocre for the price. Don't even bother"}
{"text":"I have been here on multiple occasions and I have had a very good experience each time. The servers Emily and Jill are very professional even when it is busy. I recommend this restaurant for dinner. The only complaint is that the coke tastes like Pepsi"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here last night for our anniversary. My husband called ahead to see if he could get a reservation and he was told they're not busy on Thursday's so it should be fine. We show up and had to wait over 45 minutes. We've heard a lot of great things about it so decided to wait. We ordered the crab shrimp and artichoke dip for an appetizer; it came out with nice crusty bread but the dip itself was not good. It was very bitter and was lacking in seafood flavor. I ordered the pasta poolia for my entree and it was bland and unflavorful. The best part was the Italian sausage. My husband had the Alfredo with crispy chicken added. The chicken was the best part of his dish. Alfredo is usually creamy and garlicky and it was neither. He said it just tasted like milk and cream cheese. We were very disappointed after we had heard so many great things about this restaurant. To top it off I spent the night sick and throwing up after eating here. Won't be giving them a second chance"}
{"text":"Large portions of good food, well-prepared, with friendly service at a reasonable price.  Not high-end gourmet Italian, but everything is done well.  My daughters could live alone on the bread that comes with every meal.  The roasted asparagus appetizer is a big hit.  The individual and family size pizzas are excellent.  Creative pastas and salads.  We've never had a bad meal here, and there's always leftovers."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious, fresh and plenty. We had them cater our daughter's wedding. Dustin, the catering manager and his serving team were excellent. The venue was far and they served the same delicious food piping hot. Our guests raved about the food. I cannot thank you enough for the great service with a smile. Your team served our guests as if they were family. We are so impressed with the Chandler Babbo!! Thank you Dustin and team for everything!!!!"}
{"text":"A favorite place for casual Italian. Spaghetti and meatball night (Tuesday) is a great deal for $5.99."}
{"text":"I love this place! Good food and friendly waitress. I love everything I've tried on the menus and the bread is so good. Just wish they took reservations for parties under 6."}
{"text":"first time meeting at the new place this time we had a birthday party of 15 the wait was not bad the waiting area is phenomenal it has a fireplace comfortable seating. Walls to keep the heat within. Out by the curb there was still benches in case there was an overflow. When we were seated the waiter took are drink orders the busboy Place bread and dipping oil on the table. did not have to wait very long and everybody was ready to orders.the order were taken all the food came out at the same time no mistakes in other words it was a fabulous night. highly recommended for groups or single and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"It's hard to get pasta wrong. Its also hard to stick out. Babbo does neither. A distinctly average yet affordable dining option located north of the 101 loop. They have lunch specials and decent pizza and wine."}
{"text":"So I've tried Babbo a few times now. To me it's good Italian but it didn't blow me away or anything. The restaurant is very close to where I live and so it's convenient and easy to go to. Never extremely busy which is a positive too."}
{"text":"The business left a comment on my review and said to email them for what I was assuming a comped meal or something. Emailed them weeks ago and no response. Figures!"}
{"text":"Got pasta take out from Babbo with my bf... The portions were pretty small.  Pasta with garlic cream sauce apparently means pasta with some white flavorless water at the bottom of the tin. And the amaaaazing complimentary bread that everyone was raving about is evidently only for dining in customers.  Won't be ordering from here anymore."}
{"text":"Decided to have my small birthday party here with a Scottsdale couple and 2 east valley couples. Made reservations and arrived 5 minutes early. Because of the recent remodel we were seated in a large booth that fit 8 people just fine. The sister and brother in law were my biggest concern he is a food snob but not in a good way. He wanted Pennie pasta and meat sauce. The Scottsdale couple got the drunken shrimp and the chipotle chicken pasta. The other couple wanted ziti which was not on the menu. Our server suggested a dish for the ziti lovers and special ordered for food snob. I had the roasted beets and Brussels sprouts salad and my wife got the artichoke and olive pasta dish. There was a pizza and a lot of their bread in the mix as well. No one had a compliant we were all very happy with our meal and even the food snob said he would come back and get the same thing again. That alone earned the 4 stars. Be sure to call ahead and get a reservation or just have your name on the list to get seated cause they are getting busy.."}
{"text":"So I come here often probably once a week and the only reason I still come is Kristine at the bar she is AMAZING. Shes great with customers explaining the menu and getting drinks and food to us fast not only that Shes just so nice! when me and my roommate come we don't waste our time getting a table the waiters suck and the manager (skinny guy who looks like he hates his job)suck. Every time I come in the Manager is rude to his employees and Doesn't respect them. Never says please or thank you he just looks like he doesn't want to be there instead helping staff he just makes small talk with guest. I'm never as happy with table as I am sitting at the bar. Thank you Kristine for the excellent service and the only reason my roommate and I still come here every week!

By the way I work for HR and Customer service and the only way to make happy customers is to keep good happy employees. To improve your business that's a good place to start!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad my friend found this place because we go here all the time now! We always come in at 4:00 which is the perfect time because we're the only ones in. The service is great, and their food is so delicious. The bread is always straight from the oven, the food comes out SO quick and the tiramisu is amazing. I love this place so much, we try different dishes each time and they never disappoint. Also I love atmosphere and music they play it's so cozy, I highly suggest this place!!!"}
{"text":"Good service. Our server patiently explained our options. The food was excellent. Recommended."}
{"text":"Everyone who knows me, knows I love Italian food. Babbo was really good. Definitely not the best I've ever had, but when you have great service, great food and a great ambiance then it is a winner. I felt so comfortable at this restaurant. I felt like I was a regular my first time. 

I had the spicy penne and Adam got the alfredo. Both were very good. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was savory. I had a bloody mary that I will say just slipped by my picky bloody mary radar. 

I would easily go back to eat here. I would eat here often if the was one in North Phoenix."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. A group of 13 of my coworkers went out to eat to celebrate three people who were moving to a different job. We made reservations four days in advance. The reservation was for 1:30 in the afternoon so as to avoid any kind of lunch rush. When we arrived, our table was not set up and wasn't ready until 1:45. They just pulled together several tables. After seating everyone, we discovered that the table had no napkins or cutlery.  It took another 20 minutes for us to get our drink orders taken and another 20 minutes before our drinks got there. After our orders were taken, it took 45 minutes before our food was brought to the table.  The food tasted good, but the bad taste came afterward.  By the time we got out of there, we had spent over two and half hours to eat lunch.  The poor waitress had no help and the first manager said she'd get the other manager to come over and address our concerns.  We waited for a few minutes and when he walked by our table without a glance our way, that was it.  I had to leave to return to work so that I could work late to make up the time we waisted. One coworker stayed so that she could talk to him. She said he wanted to wait until our hugging was over before he came over and interrupted. If we had waited we could've gotten 15% off of our ticket for our trouble but it was already too late he said. Really? Bogus!  The restaurant was not busy and there are no excuses for slow service.  There were two managers sitting at a table that could have pitched in and helped this poor waitress and make a good impression on their customers. However, they chose to ignore it and make a bad impression.   Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My wife and I have returned a number of times since my last review in March and each time we have enjoyed our meal.  Our most recent visit was 7/26/17 with four other family members and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals.  The service was great and the atmosphere is contemporary and fun.  I wish I could remember our waiter's name.  He was awesome,  unfortunately, he will be going off to Disney World to start his new career as part of their firefighter/EMT services."}
{"text":"Really good food.  The Chipotle Chicken Pasta is amazing.  Portion sizes are more than enough for one person and the bread before your meal is top notch.  

Few thingss are a little odd like platic tumblers for drinks and times when service is a bit subpar.  Overall, I like Babbo for the food and recommend it regularly."}
{"text":"We really should be giving this is 1 or 2 stars but we enjoyed Babbos before  so we're hoping it gets better.  So we sat at the bar only to realize they'd taken our favorite wine off the list, so we ordered  a bottle of American wine as the Italian wines are very limited . We put in an order for bruscatta and waited and waited. While we waited over 30 minutes for our appetizer we checked in via yelp and it said we'd receive a free salad.  At this time we got our appetizer we also showed the bartender the free salad order from yelp. We decided to order right away as our appetizer took over half an hour so we figured there'd be a wait again.  The appetizer we had ordered so many times before came out and look awful, we could only guess the kitchen was throwing food together and couldn't keep up. The pear was dried out and the entire thing was a mess.  But we did receive a very tiny complementary  (not) Cesar salad. Our free salad for checking in to YELP was not free!!   After this we waited about another 30 mns and told the bartender to just box up the food when it came because it was over 1.5 hours and we had to be home In 30 mn. The food still hadn't showen up in 15 MN so we cancelled our order. As soon as we did that she had the manager bring it out , packed ready to go and apologized and said it was complementary.   We ate the pesto cream pasta at home . There is zero pesto taste , only a heavy garlic cream sauce, not even green as pesto should be. First time I had ever been disappointed in babbos pasta. We will come back in 6 or 8 months when the kitchen catches up."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner at the bar tonight and our server was Chris. He was awesome and on top of it! We've been in a few time before but this was our best experience largely thanks to the service. Drinks and food came quick and we were never waiting which made for a refreshing dinner experience."}
{"text":"We always order pizza from here and come pick it up. The only complaint is have is they are almost always so busy because they are so good! The pizza is delicious and the bread we get with it is too! I love all the Parmesan, oil and vinegar we get with it. If we don't use it all up on the bread and pizza I use it on salad and pasta."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would. We ordered online for take out---didn't pack our appetizer or entire desert. Made second trip to get food, my food was so bland. Just gross. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"You probably won't be blown away by the food BUT if you can't get with $6.99 spaghetti & meatballs Mondays & Tuesdays then you're an outlier because everyone else hits this place up like mad when that special is going on- even the carry out counter has a long line. Glendale, even up here on the fancy north part of Glendale, loves and appreciates value and bang for a buck more than anything and that's where Babbo delivers. 

The sauce is very simple marinara- a little garlic, a little basil, a dash of salt and pepper. The meatballs are the star of the dish and they are huge. I wish the noodles were a little bit more al dente. There's plenty for leftovers and as I said before, it's $7 and it tastes like it costs twice as much. Dip some of the complimentary bread in that sauce and that's amore.

Service is friendly and attentive, but as it's always bustling when I'm dining here, they are hustling between tables so don't expect a lot of small talk. Seems like a family business and I'm somewhat of a regular here so I can vouch for the consistent good food and service."}
{"text":"Jacob greeted us with a BIG, genuine smile, and filled us in on the daily specials.  Our fresh-brewed iced teas were brought right away, along with the fresh bread and oil and Balsamic vinegar.  We thoroughly enjoyed the Chicken Chipotle Pasta and Portobello and Goat Cheese Pizza specials, both with side salads - hubby had the Caesar while I tried the Mista.  If we had taken our order to go, we might have licked our plates clean, it was that delicious!  Jacob is a fantastic server who is very accommodating and willingly answered all our many questions about Babbo, since we stumbled upon the place and had never been there.  BTW, Monday and Tuesday they serve their $11.95 Spaghetti & Meatballs dish for only $5.99.  (Jacob said it's pretty crowded on Spaghetti & Meatballs days, but the tables move fairly quickly.). If we lived here, we'd be here every week!  :)"}
{"text":"Visited here in the invite of friends. Difficult to find as are so many places in the Phoenix area since they're located the shopping centers and have little connection to the street address. The bread plate was way too skimpy for 4 people tho it was excellent bread. Hubs had the spaghetti and meatballs which was on sale. He enjoyed it. I had pasta primavera and ate all the great veggies out of it. Couldn't finish all the pasta. One of our friends had a calzone which was as huge as a soccer ball. He took half of it home. Service was so-so. One friend wasn't offered a drink refill until he was finished eating. Comfy place and pretty good food."}
{"text":"Full disclosure-I am a bit of an Italian food snob. I went here as my gf was meeting some friends and she mentioned the $6 spaghetti and meatballs deal. I have to say that I was really impressed. The bread was fresh and warm. The meatballs had great texture and flavor and were clearly fresh. The service was fine. If their mission was to lure me in with the discounted dinner-mission accomplished. I can definitely see going back to try some of the other items. Namely a meatball parm sub."}
{"text":"Excellent Food, Excellent Service and Excellent price. This place hit the ball out of the Park. Open kitchen concept with just a little urban contemporary feel to it. I didn't visit the bar but it appeared to be hopping also. Great open lay out with views of the entire place.

As for the food we had the Mushroom Appetizere, Awesome!  My wife had the cabbage and bacon dish, Delish! I had the Chipotle Alfredo and true to form, perfect! Add a couple of glasses of wine which were only $5.00 a piece and you have a Excellent meal for under $45.00. Unheard of in this day and age....thank you Babbo we will be back."}
{"text":"Was here last year and thought it was a decent place for a lunch.  On this second visit I had a Spaghetti with Meatballs; meatballs were good but the Marinara Sauce was not as flavorful as it ought to be.  My friend had a chopped salad with gorgonzola ... it was supposed to have chopped walnuts, which were missing, but it tasted good, minus the crunch of nuts.  The table service was very good, which made our experience a good one."}
{"text":"Staff have always been very kind and honest about what to expect with certain dishes. Food is always incredible, as is the complimentary bread- which always keeps us coming back for more!! I would suggest trying the iced teas and the chalkboard menu if you want something healthy, otherwise everything we've had is delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was great, but came out one plate at a time. By the time the last person got their food many others were already done. Service was spotty as we had to ask several times for refills and not everyone got a refill and had to ask for to go boxes 3 times. Tuesday they have a super special on spaghetti and meat balls so unless you like a crowd avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I am very excited to eat here because a friend told me how great it was, walked in and had high hopes. LOVED the ambiance of the decor, full bar, lots to choose from on the menu and the staff was super friendly, and they had diet coke which for us is a BIG deal.

They brought out bread and an olive oil/vinegar which was good, I ordered a pasta dish which was good but not amazing, I am not a big lover of tangy sauce but I ate it. My Boyfriend ordered a chicken and artichoke calzone which looked awesome when it came out but after cutting into it the cheese had not melted inside, so we sent it back. When the waitress came back, she apologized and handed him a clearly nuked in the microwave calzone which was now chewy and sad looking and said she had the cook make him another one to take with him. Although it was a nice thing to do, he didnt really care for this dish and after explaining that she offered him something else. Again, the staff was great so that wasnt the issue at all. They got him a spaghetti and meatball plate, he too ate it and felt the sauce was a bit tangy. 

When the bill came out, she did not charge us for his meal, and that impressed me, because I expected to pay for at least the spaghetti and meatballs for him as well as my dish. This showed me they want to make their customers happy and because of this I will give them another shot in the future."}
{"text":"Good food and nice staff. Sometimes service is a little slow but over all good place. I haven't had anything on the menu I didn't like. Prices are decent as well. I enjoy coming here for lunch, dinner or for last minute food"}
{"text":"I would say 3.5 stars. The place was nice and clean. We ordered the lunch special. Salad and pasta. Unfortunately the pasta was bland, not too flavorful. The portion sizes were generous though. Maybe you'll just have to see for yourself."}
{"text":"Our first time to Babbo , Cave Creek. We took our family from New York, hoping for a fun dinner experience. Unfortunately, nothing could have been further from the truth. Our server was friendly enough, but too much joking around, rather than taking care of us. I ordered a salad and entree, others ordered just an entree. All of their entrees came out at the same time as my salad, so they were going to be finished with their dinners before I even started. I asked the server why he did this, and he just looked dumbfounded. He said he would \"try\" to rush it. To no avail. I told the manager about this, and she just said \"ok, I'll talk to him. Then, at the end of the meal, after our wine was gone, our guest asked the server why an Italian restaurant doesn't serve bread? He replied, after looking shocked, \"Oh, I forgot. Would you like some of our famous focaccia bread?\" Laughable, and ignorant. I explained all of this to the\"manager\", who was hobbling around on crutches looking miserable. I asked her what she could do yo help us out, and she said she wasn't authorized to do anything. Really?? She's the manager. Finally, and reluctantly, she took a salad off our bill. We live in Cave Creek, but we won't ever be back."}
{"text":"I love Babbo! It is a small restaurant and therefore can get full pretty full on a Saturday night, but it is worth the wait. They have a great selection of interesting pasta dishes and everything I have tasted there has been very fresh. I also love the bread and oil that they serve to you when you sit down. One of my favorites is the Pasta Primavera because of all the tasty veggies, but I recently had the Bolognese and it was fantastic as well. Great customer service here as well. Last time we stopped in they were out of the wine my mom ordered, so they gave her a more expensive glass for the same price!"}
{"text":"We love going to Babbo, especially on a Monday or Tuesday for $5.99 spaghetti and meatball night!  Check in on FourSquare and get a free garlic hummus spread for the bread (delish).  Go for happy hour (until 6 p.m.) and get even more discounts on drinks / appetizers!

The staff is always friendly.  The have indoor and outdoor seating.  The cookie dessert is amazing also.  

We especially like to sit at the bar area since the view is better and the bar staff is exceedingly nice."}
{"text":"We just love this chain and this was our first go at this particular location, since we live closer to the Cave Creek one. Arriving around 5:15 p.m. we were a little ahead of the rush that happens on Mon & Tues since it's their 5.99 spaghetti and meatballs nights.  We sat at the bar, which is the norm for us.  

Our waitress was Andrea and she was wonderful!  She greeted us right as we sat down and took our drink / food orders shortly thereafter. The spaghetti was good as always!  The atmosphere at this location is a little more contemporary than the one in Cave Creek and is about half the size, but they both have a very welcoming feel to them and all of the staff members are friendly.

Overall: A 
Good spaghetti, friendly staff! When in the area, we will be back here without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Friends had raved about this place, so we tried it a few days ago.  The food was GREAT.  They have a large menu with interesting dishes, not just a few boring menu items.  Service was great.  Atmosphere was nice too.  Place is nicely decorated.  Some sections were more family-oriented while other areas would be nice to sit with a date.  We will definitely go back to try more of their menu.  Prices were about average for the area."}
{"text":"Thank God for Groupon.  I was fortunate enough to buy 3 Groupons for this joint.  I took my family here and we really enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  Everyone was friendly.  Here's what we had:

Firecracker Rolls - $7.95 (we tried the Buffalo Chicken and the Italian rolls, yum!)
Mushroom/Pepperoni Pizza - $10.50
Sicilian Pizza (Italian Sausage, Capicola Ham, Salami, Basil, Oregano, Mozz & Provolone) - $10.50
Mushroom/Pepperoni Calzone - $10.50

My favorite dishes are the Firecracker Rolls and the Sicilian Pizza.  The place can get packed on the weekends.  Go during the week if you prefer a quieter evening.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Everything we had was excellent!   Manacotti, Spaghetti Bolonese, Meatballs, Chipotle Mac & Cheese with spicy Italian Sausage... S cleaned the bowl!  If you know me, no one makes better sauce, in my mind, & it's not mine but excellent! Everything was so good! We will be back to try more.  Elizabeth was awesome too! ;o}"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best salads! My favorite is the Roasted Brussel Sprout Beet Salad. The bread is very tasty as well. I'd also recommend trying their Firecracker Roll with Steak. Their online ordering is very convenient. Their pasta's are alright, I've had better pasta though."}
{"text":"Steak firecracker rolls are awesome. All their salads are excellent too. Not a huge fan of their pasta."}
{"text":"It was ok... that's about it. Nice looking restaurant, decent pricing, our server was good but nothing memorable. I had the mac & cheese- spicier than I would have imagined, but I had been warned. It did not reheat well the next day, and I tried both the oven and microwave seperately. The bread at the beginning truly is fantastic, but I won't run back to a restaurant for bread (usually lol). HH looks intriguing, so I may be back to try other dishes, won't be upset if I never make it though"}
{"text":"Eat here about 1X/mo.  We like the happy hour here.  Order 2 margherita pizzas and roasted asparagus and it's a full meal for us.  We have eaten here for dinner and their pastas are fine.  The staff is all young yet pleasant."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience here. First, we order appetizer and after waiting we've been told that it is actually frozen and we'll have to order another thing. So we did but afterwards they bring the pasta and it has a long dark hair in it! We tell the manger and without saying sorry or anything he takes the plate and disappears we wait for the check another 5 minutes the waiter brings it and says although they don't have anyone with \"long hair\", it's on the house. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It never disappoints and it seems like a lot of people agree because it's always packed! 

It's a nice inviting restaurant. Mostly tables but they have a few large booths if you are lucky enough to get one.  

We started out with the garlic hummus dip. It's very similar to regular hummus but with a blend of garlic and anchovies. Lots of garlic! Don't worry, it's not fishy at all and you can never have too much garlic right? Super good, but you probably won't be kissing anyone after eating it! 

For my entree I had the Pasta Puglia (poo-lia). I have dinned at Babbo several times and I always seem to order it!  It's a combinations of Fresh Tomato Brodo, Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Sausage topped with Fresh Basil and Shaved Parmesan Cheese. Served on Fusilli pasta. The sausage in this is fantastic! 

My mother ordered a salad and pizza lunch combination. She had the Caesar salad and a nice sized personal sausage, pepperoni and mushroom pizza. She loved it. I of course had to try a slice to confirm...I loved it too!

Check out Babbo! You won't be disappointed. They also run pretty good specials certain days of the week! Great happy hour too! 

By the way, I was at a holiday party over the weekend catered by Babbo! Everything was delicious! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great value for the price.  I got 2 meals out of $15 spent.  Family friendly environment with great customer service.  Join their mailing list for awesome loyalty specials."}
{"text":"Cute place. It can feel crowded. Service was quick and friendly. My husband and I shared a large pizza. It was more then enough.
I would go back. Reasonable prices
Are server was named Emily. Thanks for the nice service."}
{"text":"I LOVE Babbo! A new location opened near my office (Ray & Rural), and a friend said she loved the food from eating at other locations, so I decided to try it. 8 visits (making me the mayor of Babbo on Foursquare!) I can say that the food is amazing, and the service is outstanding. The location is quiet, making it a great place to take business guests from out of town to lunch, or to relax and enjoy. Their crown jewel is the bread they put on the table prior to your meal arriving. I have never had better bread. It's soft and flavorful, and soaks up the olive oil and balsamic dipping sauce like a champ. The salads are fresh and bursting with flavor, the pastas are fresh, pizzas taste delicious, but my favorite is the Smoked Turkey sandwich, which comes on that amazing bread. I can honestly say that every time I have been here, the food and service have been consistently wonderful. I will be back many, many times over."}
{"text":"I stopped by last week for dinner.  The restaurant was around 80% full when we arrived at 6, completely full shortly after.

The food was great, reasonably priced, and was a generous portion.  I had a salad and pancetta.

The service was stellar.  Our server was on the ball.  Our drinks were never empty. Salads were out in under 10 minutes.  Dinner was out before I finished my salad."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered food togo tonight, neither of us have ever eaten at Babbos and we received a coupon in the mail so thought we'd give it a shot. The verdict, it satisfied our hunger but nothing more. It's not memorable and sadly we will not return.
We ordered the cheese bread (FYI it has mayo on it, yuck), neopolitan pizza, and rustico pasta. We also got the zeppole for dessert. We live .8 miles from this restaurant and when we arrived the girl at the counter let us know we were just waiting on the Pizza. Our pasta and everything else was ready when we arrived and we waited at least 10 minutes for the pizza. So, when we got home our food was luke warm at best. My husband was so grossed out that the bread had mayo on it. The menu does not list this on there. I called the restaurant to see if it did in fact have mayo and the kid had to go ask someone, he came back to the phone and confirmed, yes it's a garlic mayo spread. Well that was $8+ straight in the trash, my husband wouldn't touch it! The pizza was mediocre at best. It really lacked any sort of flavor. The pasta was room temp and grainy; room temp from being ready well before the pizza and grainy from the ricotta?. Needless to say we both thought the best part of the meal was the FREE bread, (ciabatta maybe) they gave us. That was soooooo good. The Zeppole was just OK, but I do believe if it's ordered in house and consumed right away, it's probably fantastic. I really wanted to like this place since it's so close to home, but unfortunately we'll be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've put off trying this Italian chain for quite a while, because I am super spoiled rotten - my hubby makes amazing, authentic Italian food at home, so my discerning palate is usually disappointed when trying to have it somewhere else. 

Last week, I finally broke down and came here - I ordered the flank steak salad. It was really good, although it was a bit heavy on gorgonzola (I can't believe I just typed that... there is NO such thing as too much stinky cheese!). I loved their focaccia and dipping oil, too. My only complaint was that the 'small' salad size was still too freaking big, and I wish I had tried the new roasted brussel sprout and beet salad. That one sounds really tasty... so, next time. :)"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing, We had the MAC AND CHEESE and a Buffalo Chicken Ceaser sandwich.  All the food including the bread sticks were on point.  Very flavorful and delicious.  Staff was very outgoing and friendly.  Although there were TONS of old people at this location and the wait staff was mainly younger alternative looking kids they managed to make the old people smile.  The only cons to the place is it kinda smelled like a dumpster near the outside seating.  Also the chairs out there were VERY uncomfortable.....but the food was amazing so i overlook the cons in my star rating :)"}
{"text":"We love Babbo! In fact, this is the restaurant that we have designated as the tie-breaker restaurant. 
If we can't agree on where to go to dinner, we go to Babbo.
There is something for everyone in our picky family. We always end up with a variety from the menu. I LOVE the creamy pesto pasta and the kids always get pizza and eat all of it.
The bread they bring before the meal is worthy of mention as well. It's what hooked us in the first place. 
Definitely check it out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We arrived at about 5:30pm and were seated immediately.  As others have said the interior decor is very nice.  It is a very casual and relaxed environment.  Warm bread with olive oil and vinegar is provided right after you sit down.  The bread was great!   We ordered chicken Parmesan pasta and creamy pesto pasta.  Both dishes came out nice and hot.  They tasted great but both of us agreed that there was too much sauce on the pastas.  Our server was very attentive and the manager came over and checked in on us too.  

We will definitely be back for lunch or dinner again soon."}
{"text":"Food bad salad lettuce turned brown and the pasta was dry and very saulty. I don't think we will be going back.  It took 10 min to get seated and we were the only one waiting, the bartender finally seen us waiting and took us to a table."}
{"text":"Bread is really good, pasta chipotle was decent. Prices were very high for the amount of food you get. The prices were neck and neck with a Maggianos and unfortunately it doesn't hold a candle."}
{"text":"The worst place and experience ever. The manager was sitting and talking on her phone cussing next to us, never asked if we were doing ok even after we waited for about 45 minutes to eat. The pasta was over cooked. Wow, what a terrible place. I gave it a 1 star because I had to rate it. It deserves nothing. It really was the worst dining experience of my life."}
{"text":"I called at 2 pm and asked if they had gf pasta and they said yes. I asked if I could make a res for 6 adults and 3 kids and the girl said yes, for parties over 6. I said great, let me call you back in a couple mins. I called both my parties, confirmed times and called the restaurant back..I said hi, I just called and would like to make a reservation for tonight for 9 people to which a different girl who answered the phone, told me they don't do res the same day! I told her I just called two mins ago and the other girl didn't mention anything so she said let me double check..she got back on and said ok, we can do it! Ok awesome! We get there and get told that they don't have a booth big enough for all of us, so I'm like ok, well how bout we push this table that seats 4 up against a booth that seats 6 and tada, you can fit us! Then she said it's against their policy?! You have a policy where you can't move tables? So then she tried putting us in 2 separate booths where our party would be divided...hello ?? What's the point of going out to dinner with your family if you can't see or talk to them?! So I pretty much demanded they moved the tables together cuz I was pissed that they didn't think there was ANY issue over the phone with seating when I made the res..and it's not like I could have just walked out cuz my son is gluten free and there's only so many places we can eat. The food was good, but there needs to be more organization with the person taking the reservation and if you can seat a party that large together...so we can eat as a family! It's even more embarrassing that my parents moved to az a month ago and they have to see this craziness at a restaurant..."}
{"text":"my first visit- my family goes here often for the 5.99 Mon/Tue marinara pasta with 2 amazing meatballs. Seriously great recipe and preparation as they were moist and not over worked. Fine dining restaurant rarely get this right. Also the salad mixed greens with great dressing, pine nuts, feta, raisins- very nicely done.    Service is where the delivery happens....  was not 'present' as in we asked for a cup for coffee to go. They don't have to go for hot drinks so she brought an empty to go cup/styrofoam which is fine,thought she expected for us to put the cold 1/2 cup of coffee into the cup. Also came with  a plastic lid (like for a soda which is fine if that is all they have) and a straw! Then when we asked for a box for left over entree, she only brought one for that, instead of one also for all the bread and garlic butter we had left. She was just not observant, young and just needs some good training to deliver the product you are selling- as she was basically friendly. 
Atmosphere, very nice for a place in a strip mall. 
Cheers"}
{"text":"I decided on Babbo for my birthday dinner last night 10/14. I was so please with this decision. Our server was Jessica. She was amazing. Super nice and very attentive. The food was delicious and there are never any complaints about the wine. Thank you Jessica for making my birthday dinner special."}
{"text":"We are Babbo regulars solely due to the proximity to our home. The restaurant is always clean and the ambience nice.

We primarily take out from this location to avoid the constant influx of rude elderly snowbirds. Otherwise, your meal is certainly with a degree of danger from all the oxygen tanks in close proximity to the kitchen flames! I jest...kind of.

The fare is standard. Not the best Italian I have had, but not the worst. We stick to the same items all the time: the 3-cheese Mac & Cheese, the asparagus with mushrooms and the fetuccine alfredo. We have tried sandwiches, but there is usually too much vinegar and my spouse is allergic. 

Overall, Babbo is a welcome change from the IHOPs and other lame, overpopulated chain establishments."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I haven't had a bad dish yet.  My favorite is the Pasta Rustico (and the bread!).  Good food, decent service. I will definitely continue going here."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Babbo. We eat here at least a couple of times a month, mostly takeout but occasionally in the restaurant. The quality of the food is consistent and good."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to eat there tonight and were extremely disappointed. First they were out of the appetizer they requested then they were out if broccoli (which was suppose to be included in several of their entrees).Then i ordered a personal pizza which came out in about 25 minutes then waited another 15 minutes for his pasta. The kitchen had poor timing when it comes to food. His pasta reeked of only kalamata olives to the point i was getting nauseas smelling it across the table. Even the waiter said im sorry you waited 45 minutes for a pasta you didnt like. Obviously, he was bummed as it tasted just as poor. So after sitting for over an hour i had eaten my personal pizza (which was fine- nothing negative to say about it) and my husband was hungry- both left frustrated. Informed the manager granted they comped the meal- they really didnt seem interested in the concerns- just wanted to blame a chef for calling out and having a rough kitchen. Not our problem. Would not return."}

{"text":"My mom is a serious pain in the ass. Esspecialy on dinner occasions. She's older, she rides around in a scooter, and she expects people to psychically determine what she wants. When she walked (*scootered) into this place she just made shit up and said they always served meatballs on tuesdays. Just meatballs. Always. The special was actually meatballs with spaghetti.  Which did not please her, because weirdly there was not supposed to be spaghetti with the meatballs.  That makes no sense.  But the server handled it like a champ, long story short just took it back and put the meatballs on a separate dish. Then asked mom if she wanted her to dish her some of the spaghetti on the separate plate. Suddenly mom was interested in the spaghetti.  But the server was going to give her too much at first, so she protested. Then, finally, all was well.  I sat in a state of horrified shock.........I thought our server was excellent and had remarkable patience. She was kind throughout the whole ordeal . So big points for politeness of staff. Food was okay. Our neighboring table loved the place and knew the menu by heart. Weird conversations were had. Arizona is freaky."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in tonight's service.  First the hostess sits the group that came in after us before us.  

I share with her my frustration and tell her I'll need to speak to the manager.  He comes over and states that the group was there first. This was all based on her trying to cover it up by saying the lady in the group was in the restroom when I walked in.  She lied it was the husband that went to the restroom after I moved to make room for her and an older man.  There's no way I would have to make room for them if they came in before me.  

The manager agreed to give us a 20% did outs.  Next a lady who is trying to quiet her newborn is walking around her table when she causes our server to spill all our meals. 

Our meals are delayed, and overall we only received a 20% discount.  I'm an ongoing patron, most of the time is for take out.  This was a horrible night to eat in.  The dinner experience was way to long and the two mistakes don't justify such a small discount.

I was one of their first clients when they moved in to the neighborhood.  Good thing is that there is more dining options in our area."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Will not be returning. There were excuses for food not being delivered while larger tables received their food.  Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"I ate here last night with my wife. Classy looking place with decent prices. The food was average. I would have given 4 stars, but we were given our appetizer without any silverware. After about 10 minutes of waiting for our server to come back and check on us, I finally gave up and went to the bar to ask for eating utensils. We will go back to re-evaluate in the future."}
{"text":"Time for the review! I have been here a handful of times, each visit was just as good as the last. Parking is easy and the service is always happy to help. Inside is classy and clean, nice lighting making for a great ambiance. Food has always been fantastic, especially the pizzas and bruschetta! This time I actually had take out and the food was ready in 15 minutes tops. Luckily they have take out parking spaces to make the trip a lot quicker! Ordered the Margherita and the Quattro formaggi pizza with the Pesto bruschetta appetizer. Those are my go to foods when I'm here! Great place, great food and great service. What more can you ask for? Now don't be shy, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Ordered a mid week dinner to go using their online ordering.   It was ready to go in a nice big bag when we came to pick it up and had everything we needed for a great meal at home.  We ordered a custom Calzone, a Sicilian  pizza and the Steak Panino (their version of a Philly sandwich with the special ingredient of bruschetta tomatoes!!).   Also tried the Firecracker rolls (one of each kind) and will probably order that as dinner the next time since it also comes with a salad.   Everything  was wonderfull and cleanup was a snap with that big bag!!  Will definitely do this again!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is slightly upscale (for the area) modern and clean. The staff is mostly younger, somewhat impatient and unfriendly. The bread is delicious, but wait staff seem bothered when you ask for more, or anything for that matter. Food is good, but portions are rather small for the price. We've eaten here several times and it's always the same. Not exactly what we consider authentic Italian, but it does the trick if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We have been ordering the $6.99 spaghetti and meatballs every Monday or Tuesday for the last 2 years. It's the best kept secret around. Just over $20 gives us 3 orders of spaghetti, each with two huge meatballs, and their amazingly soft and delicious onion and garlic bread. It is always plenty of food for two adults and two kids. I can't wait for next week!"}
{"text":"For the price it was mediocre. The pasta, salad, and bread were average and the service was nothing great. We had a party of 6 and this was a mutual feeling amongst all of us. The atmosphere was promising and we may have had a better experience just ordering drinks at the bar or coming for a quick lunch. Maybe next time we'll try the pizza."}
{"text":"Tonight we were first timers at this establishment. I'm SO happy we chose this restaurant, and this day/time to go. We were sat after a short wait, and greeted by Ann (sorry if I spelled it wrong). She was AMAZING, to say the least. She was basically like that one friend's mom who loves when kids come over for dinner. She was extremely friendly, funny, and just all around awesome. Oh, and the food was pretty good too. ;) If I could give 294727 stars, I would. The atmosphere of the whole place was just amazing. 10/10 will come back AND tell all our friends to check it out! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Underrated really. Good food and atmosphere. Free bread and oil. Like Olive Garden if Olive Garden had good food."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat!!  Great value!
Yes, it can get busy ESPECIALLY DURING SNOWBIRD SEASON !!! Holy cow! Brace yourself!
Their monday pasta specials are great and their service is just as good.
Their bread is to die for !!'

All i can say is BABBO gets it!"}
{"text":"Babbo
I watched this restaurant being built 
It is clean and nice inside. 
It is in a great location on Talking Stick, we were greeted and seated  upon entering by the hostess. 
We sat at our table for 10 minutes before I had to grab a server. We had no water nor bread , the temperature outside was 90. 

The food came fairly quickly and was just ok. 
I don't think I will be back to eat there. 
Maybe take out or cook at home."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and had a pleasant experience. My hubby had the Mac and cheese with sausage. I was soooo jealous because it was delicious! My dish was very good, but the Mac and cheese was so much better. The portions were substantial. We had the house merlot which was nice and silky smooth. If I'm ever so far north of Phoenix again , I will definitely give Babbo another visit."}
{"text":"We love having Babbos in our neighborhood in Tatum Ranch.  The food is consistent....great bread!  The Buffalo Chicken Salad is my favorite.  At times, the service can be a bit inconsistent.  I love their take out service.  Great little pizzas as well.  A must try if you're in the Tatum Ranch area or even just being in North Phoenix might be worth the drive."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Great prices, cool atmosphere, young friendly attentive staff... But most importantly, the food was out of this world.

The stuffed portabella w/ sausage was seriously to die for! The bruschetta was different. They give you 6 crostinies and a bowl of marinated tomatos and you basically make them yourselves at the table. I thought that was cute and fun...

We were here on vacation from CT , and looking
For a small decent priced pizzeria/italian place and we certainly found a real gem.
If you are from town or out of town, check this place out!

A++"}
{"text":"After living in Surprise this place has been on our must try list. We finally made it in last night, and will definitely be going back! 

The staff was great! Everyone from the hostess to our server, Anthony, was welcoming and super friendly!

The food was AMAZING! We ordered  Italian Sausage, Mac & cheese and the kids spaghetti with a meatball, and all of us loved our food. For dessert we shares the double chocolate chip cookie covered with ice cream YUM!!"}
{"text":"Food was really good and the bread was delicious. Had the manicotti, sauce was tasty. Good size portions, good service. The employees were nice and so was the dining area."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat especially on Monday and Tuesday for the pasta special. They make excellent drinks here, the Moscow mules are ah-mazing! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I have yet to actually dine in but I can say the take out is amazing!  The manager is always friendly.  

I love the Pasta Martini with the bread and dipping oil...simply yummy.  

The interior is quaint and there seems to be great business each time I stop by.  I like that they have a small bar area if you just want to have a glass of wine and nibble on appetizers or wait for your food to go."}
{"text":"This place opened a few months ago within walking distance of my condo.  I never ventured in until last night, when an out of town friend took me to dinner.  It was Monday night, and they had a $5.99 spaghetti special that I didn't even know about.  

The place was packed when we arrived, and the decor is quite nice.  The ambience was good as well, with muted conversations all around us.  We were seated quickly and the service was quite fast, especially considering the crowded nature of the place due to the special.  We ordered an appetizer of special egg rolls ($7.50) filled with steak, chicken and ground beef.  The steak one was the best, but all of them were great, and the spicy sauce for dipping was amazing.  The little salad on the side was a nice touch as well, along with the standard roasted bread they bring for free, served with oil and vinegar.  Yum...yum.  

We both ordered the special and it was really quite good.  The meatballs were pretty good and much better than Buca di Beppo's nasty meatballs.  There was a little too much sauce, but at least it was slightly sweet and tasty.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, and overall this is one of the better dining experiences I've had recently, much better than The Old Spaghetti Factory I went to Sunday night with some friends.  

I give it an A- and will be back with more friends soon.  Very soon, in fact."}
{"text":"Came in a night that wasn't too busy and got seated by a hostess right away. She brought us over our menus and told us a waiter would be with us. 10 min pass by and no one comes to our table. There were several people working that that night and it was apparent there were plenty of staff there that night compared to number of patrons in the restaurant. My boyfriend and I could see at least 4-5 waiters huddled around a computer counter just talking the entire time we were there. Ended up waiting over 20 min without so much as an order for drinks being taken or a waiter approaching our table so we left to find another place for dinner. Bad customer service in my book. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Horrible service, I ordered a pizza and salad on a lunch menu and waiter brought out pasta instead. Waited for about twenty minutes  for waiter to return to the table and they said they can make a pizza since it was the wrong order.  Meanwhile after a twenty min wait it wasn't realistic to wait for a pizza to be made. About ten min later a manager came to the table and asked if I was going to eat the pasta even though it was the wrong meal. I declined and the manager took the pasta from the bill but returned with a bill charging for a salad at full menu price which was the same price as the lunch special."}
{"text":"I still go to Babbo on a regular basis for the FOOD only.   This is the only reason I go.   The service is consistently awful.   I've only had one good server here (Lori) in all the years I have been coming here.  They are slow, and I mean slow.   A couple of months ago went for lunch with my husband and parents.   We waited 50 minutes just for beer and salads.   The lunch took over two hours.   Today I went again with my husband and it took us 35 minutes for a salad and water/tea.   They always use the same excuse.   \"She's backed up on the salads.\"   Another excuse we have heard \"we had a big party today.\"    The main manager knows we are regulars but never says \"hi.\"  It's a good thing the food is good.   Just don't go if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Babbo is a great restaurant I like to go to with my dad when I am visiting. The bread they give you prior to your meal is easy to fill up on, but that's alright because you can take more food home. I typically get one of the pastas, and they're all pretty good."}
{"text":"Incompetence mixed with low quality food. 

This is the final time I am attempting to eat Babbo food. There's always an issue. 

This time, I ordered my meal online for pick up to go, the email said it would be ready in about 20 minutes. My wife and I get in the car with our 2 week old baby to grab something from the pharmacy, pick up dinner, and head home. We arrive at Babbo 20 mins after we ordered to find the typical disorganized chaos that surrounds their to-go area. My wife stayed in the car with the baby while I \"ran in\" to grab the food. I sat there for TWENTY FIVE minutes before it was ready, so 45 total minutes since I placed the order. For one calzone & one spaghetti. While my wife and baby sat in the car. Was told \"sorry boss something got mixed up with the calzones.\" Huh? Ok? Who's managing anything around there?? Never saw an actual manager anywhere. 

Then, of course, we finally get home with the food to find they didn't put ANY of the side items in the bag- no utensils, no peppers, no cheese, no oil & vinegar for the bread. Awesome. 

At the end of the day, their food is simply not worth it. They're basically what taco bell is to mexican food. 

I'm out. This place is banned.

EDIT: Just cut into this calzone.. the only special request I had in the order was no Ricotta in the calzone, guess what? Ricotta!!! Yayyy!! Thanks Babbo! We got to wait 45 minutes for an order filled with cheese that I don't like! You're the best."}
{"text":"Babbo always hits the spot when you're looking for good wine, food, and service (in that order, wine over errythang). Dishes are flavorful, served hot, and well priced."}
{"text":"If I could give 4 1/2 stars I would.  This place is truly great! The food is affordable... and very tasty.... The menu has a lot to offer.  The staff has always been friendly.  We have eaten here at least a dozen times in the past 2 years. 

The places is busy... so... I would suggest ordering online and picking it up to go.  

We will be back... great place !"}
{"text":"I ended up eating plastic!  Literally, I had plastic strips in my calzone!  No one could tell me why other than manager said she was sorry.  I did get my plastic calzone for free and free desert which was not great ( tiramisu) .  My wife loves this place however after eating plastic I will probably never go back."}
{"text":"Food was awesome the first time we went and just okay the second time. Maybe it was a different chef? The atmosphere is nice, bread is good, big menu. Service is normally good. I'll still go back"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! This by far is my family's favorite Italian Restaurant! The bread is awesome the service is Outstanding!! We have been here plenty of time and have never had a bad experience yet! We recommend this place to anyone who wants great tasting food with even better prices!"}
{"text":"Awesome food at a decent price.
Stopped in today for dinner because I've never been and Olive Garden is too far to drive in rush hour. Glad I stopped by! You get a free foccacia bread (freshly baked and very light and fluffy) with a olive oil/balsamic vinegar dip. We got a side of the garlic hummus also and it was awesome. I got a calzone with meatballs, bacon and extra cheese for $11 and it was HUGE and delicious - their mozzarella is very smoky and balanced with the two meats, it was perfect. It came with a side of marinara but was also good with the hummus spread. 
Service was a little slow as the place got busier but that's to be expected. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"First, I wish Yelp would allow 1/2 stars.  I hate rating a restaurant 2 stars unless  it's really awful.  This place however should only get 2 1/2 stars rather than three.

I took my family here on Saturday for lunch.  While the food was decent, the service was sub-par.  I made the mistake of ordering Amy's Lasagna.  On the menu, it does indicate that it will take 'a little longer' but that turned into a nearly 45 minute wait for lunch in a nearly empty restaurant. In addition, the waitress was unable to get the orders straight. My dad ordered a Caesar's Salad and instead received a wedge with bacon (he's kosher so a big no-no).  Wife ordered a salad with salmon and they forgot the salmon.    

What really dropped the rating however was the attitude of the waitress.  Initially she seemed really pleasant but as issues arose, she became defensive and a bit huffy.  

Overall, the food was good for a chain, but it doesn't approach any of the better Italian restaurants in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Great food, large selection on the vast menu. Prices were affordable and a great value. Very nice atmosphere. Waiter was so friendly and made sure we all are satisfied. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Love the Bolognese with Pasta. Their red sauce, almost as good as Nani's.   Great Happy hour specials. Wonderful company and service from Aiden at the bar. Can't wait to come back for Meatball Monday."}
{"text":"After eating at Babbo, there is absolutely no reason to eat at Olive Garden.  The food tastes better, is cheaper, and the bread is much better than the breadsticks at Olive Garden.  There is plenty of pasta selections ranging from Seafood to Spaghetti and Meatballs.  And the pasta was plentiful enough for even the biggest and fattest pasta fan to feel satisfied afterwards. 

Although the prices can be a bit expensive, you can always wait until Monday and have nice cheap Spaghetti and Meatballs for only $5.99.  It's a great place to eat whether you're on a date or just by yourself."}
{"text":"If I could give a 3.5 I would.... My husband and I visited on a Saturday at around 4:30pm.  The place was pretty empty, so we were seated quickly.  
The waiter brought us out some complimentary bread and olive oil (drizzled with balsamic).  Bread and oil, eh.  
We ordered the \"Firecracker Rolls\", and I got Italian Style.  They serve this with spicy marinara, and it is SPICY marinara.  The flavor was outstanding for these, but I could only have one; it was extremely salty.  Way too salty.
I had the Italian Sausage Pasta, which is described as, \"Marinara Sauce, Spicy Italian Sausage, Mixed Peppers, Mushrooms, Marsala Wine, Parmesan Cheese. Served on Penne.\".  This was delicious, but again, salty.  Husband had the manicotti, this was his second time ordering this, so he must like it.
The service was ok, it is one of those places where your server takes your order and brings your check, that's it.  Other staff brought out the food, etc.  We waited  bit for our check, but it wasn't too horrible.  Prices were fair, for what you get.  I would have rather had a small dinner salad than some bread and oil though."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place...great pasta, good service.  Only complaint, always busy!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite restaurants!! My husband and I have driven past Babbo many times and stopped to give it a try. It was a busy Friday night around 7 but we were seated quickly and our food followed shortly thereafter. A nice warm & fresh plate of bread started us off with some olive oil & balsamic vinegar to dip. Delicious! My husband got the chicken artichoke calzone and it was amazing. What a combo & it was massive! I got the garlic shrimp pasta which was also to die for. Prices were reasonable & the service was great. 5 stars because I wouldn't have changed anything about our experience. It was a great night out. We will certainly be back again & soon!"}
{"text":"Decided to go for dinner one night just to try it and was very happy. The food was fantastic and the service was wonderful. This is a great place to go for dinner."}
{"text":"It's hard to really jack up Italian food.  Babbo manages to do it.  We are friends with a couple that have brought us to Babbo's a couple of times.  Each meal has just been a mess.  The food is bad . . . like real bad.  

I ordered, what from the menu description looked like, a grilled chicken breast on some spicy, creamy sauce and pasta.  What I got was a bowl so loaded with sauce that I thought they brought me the wrong meal, mistaking my meal for a bowl of soup.  I've attached pictures.  Turns out I was wrong and the meal was correct.  When the plate was placed in front of me it was so loaded with sauce that I couldn't see a single piece of pasta or chicken.  Turns out it was only partially because of the sauce and partially because there was hardly any actual food in it.  I spent the majority of time using two fork to sift through the liquid to find something to eat.  

Our friend's pasta dish was very much the same, just not quite as bad.  

My wife thought her plate was not season at all.  My 5-year-old son, eating Mac and Cheese said, \"Ma, I don't like this . . . it doesn't taste like anything.\"  

Bad, bad, bad . . . Service was so-so.  The rest of the place was nice and clean.  The food's just bad . . . or at least our meal was the past three visits.  When we left we made our friends agree would not be returning to a Babbo."}
{"text":"I wish I could say the food at Babbo was great but I have no idea because we never made it that far into our visit. Went in on a weeknight. They were busy but we were seated right away. The waiter came over shortly after we sat down and asked if we knew what we wanted. Having never been there before and looking at their pretty extensive menu I said we needed a few minutes. I guess we should have just picked something right then and there because he never came back. We sat for 20 minutes, tried to make eye contact with someone, anyone, but no luck. Our waiter even went to tables near us to clean plates but never looked our way. So we got up and left. Guess we can cross Babbo off our list. Oh well, seemed like a cross between Olive Garden and Denny's anyway."}
{"text":"Yay I'm a fan of this sandwich! 

Italiano sandwich - Genoa salami, ham, capicola, tomatoes, pepperoncini, provolone & Romano topped with fresh mozzarella, romaine lettuce and Italian vinaigrette served on fresh baked foccacia. This sandwich is delicious the foccacia was peppered the mozzarella is very fresh, this sandwich itself gets 5 stars! So freakin good! There is something delicious happening here. The salt and pepper of the meats and cheese blend just right. THIS SAMMY WILL MAKE YA SLAP YA MAMMY! Split it with a co-worker for lunch oh yay!"}
{"text":"great eats, even if you don't get the all you can eat spaghetti. Had the arugula and white bean salad plus two penne pasta dishes. Both very good. Good Italian food in a nice atmosphere at decent prices with good waitstaff."}
{"text":"What can i say!  I had the Lasagna, they had a \"warning\" on the menu that it would take a little longer and i almost didn't order it, sooo glad i did, one of the very best Lasagna's i have ever had.  Everyone else was happy with their food as well, but, i can't imagine it being better than what i had, still dreaming of it.  Great food, excellent staff, fun atmosphere.  Don't miss!"}
{"text":"Babbo's is a great place for lunch and dinner.  It has never disappointed us. My wife and I stopped by yesterday for a late lunch.  Lot's of folks taking advantage of outdoor seating, but we decided to take a booth inside where it was quieter.  Jacob, our waiter, sat us quickly and took our drink order to give us time to check the menu.  My wife chose Italiano Sandwich with Zucca Chips and I picked Salsiccia Sandwich with Pasta Salad.  While waiting for our sandwiches we nibbled on Foccacia bread dipped in their oil and balsamic vinegar.  This is a favorite for us and we enjoyed sharing bread before the meal.  Our sandwiches were excellent; both served on foccacia bread and large enough to take home half for a late dinner.  My Salsiccia was filled with spicy Italian sausage, grilled onions, sweet peppers, tomatoes and cheese.  So tasty.  The sausage spilled out and I had to keep tucking it back in.  Each bite was a delight.  The favors were savory and sweet and perfectly blended.  This is now one of my favorites. My wife's sandwich was equally delicious and the bite shared with me proved it.  The restaurant was quiet this afternoon, and it was easy to have a conversation and just enjoy our meal and time together.  The side benefit is that the size of the sandwiches gave us a chance to take some home for us to enjoy while we Netflix and Chilled."}
{"text":"This is strictly a family restaurant, it is very inexpensive for what you get, but the food is very generic. The service ranges from good to excellent. The Decour is comfortable and the place is easy to access. If you're entertaining out-of-town guests this is not the place to go unless you have kids in tow. You would never take a date to this place unless you wanted it to be your last date. This is strictly a corporate mass produced food place, premade food disguised as fresh food. Essentially, a fast food restaurant. The same kind of food you whip up in your kitchen if you only have 10 minutes to cook."}
{"text":"Dinner with my boys after hitting the range. Enjoying our discussion over some pasta and drinks. Love the fresh bread and oil & balsamic vinegar. Delicious pasta dishes that no one wanted to share. Service was great and friendly. Hubbin was a bit shocked his cocktail came without ice but enjoyed it anyway. Very nice dinner."}
{"text":"Enjoy eating here. Good food and friendly staff!
Every dish I have tried here has been good. I love the bread and the Mista salad."}
{"text":"Stop by on Thursday for their chicken parmesan special ,took it as a takeout, service was great, the food at Babbo's is always good. Also I recommend trying the lasagna very very good. I also suggest you signing up for their email notifications they'll send you special offers you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Love Babbo's.  Prices are great.  The Mista Salad is a favorite right along with the spicy mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I must say the bartender was awesome tonight.  We had a 15 month old and he was so accommodating and helpful!  Always had a smile on his face very personable."}
{"text":"Simply spectacular 
This place is so wonderful !! Let me start by saying the kid menu is extensive and it's only $6 per person including a drink .. Such a deal!!!
I had something off the chalkboard menu - it was chicken with mushroom Marsala and roasted veges . Plus it came with a small salad for $13 
On Mondays they do spaghetti and meatballs for $5.99 .. Best deal in town"}
{"text":"Babbo Has good happy hour appetizers and drinks. We were having such a great time drinking and appetizers on the patio we never actually had dinner - so pretty a great evening. 

Best Apps were the Firecracker rolls and the stuffed Mushrooms. 

Great place for large group, we were 15 and took up a long set of tables on the patio. 

I think you get my point...sit in the patio, have a drink and enjoy yourself. Finish it off with a nice Italian soda as a desert."}
{"text":"We love their salads and Monday spaghetti specials.  Their happy hour sangria's are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Always come here for Spaghetti and Meatballs on Monday and Tuesday.  You can't mess up noodles, and the sauce is good and the meatballs are really good.  Great place to dine out if you are on a budget or need a break from over paying at other places.  Service is good if not a little slow, but that's because the place is usually packed to the ceilings on the days we go."}
{"text":"Best and closest to homemade Italian food!  Service is always great and friendly!  Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Catching up on reviews.  Worst EVER.  My friends and I used to love this place, but alas for the last time we were there destroyed it for us all the way around.   Even this long and I still wouldn't consider going back.

It was dinner hour so there was a wait, which was fine.  We were seated in a booth area next to the front door, which was fine.  What was not fine was being ignored for a long while until we asked if we were getting a server.  We were sent a trainee that didn't know how to take a drink order and it went downhill from there.  Confusion, long wait for cold sloppily prepared food and when the trainee server offered for us to speak to a manager a 3rd time, then came back to say she's too busy we'll have to wait... that sealed it.  I even took a breath and said they are busy and if everyone is getting served like this, I'm sure she's busy so I left my number on the ticket to be contacted.  It's been long enough, so here is the review.  I can't recommend them at all due to the poor service from management down."}
{"text":"I am a Babbo fan in general, but I am very dissatisfied with my trip to this location.

I came to this location to meet family visiting from California, one of whom has eaten at some other Babbo locations. At the other locations, we had great food and service and she was excited to return.

This location did a poor poor job of representing Babbo to the other member of our party, with an excessive wait time to start our experience off, and then just very amateurish service for the duration of our visit. Not enough visits to the table at all, drinks left empty for too long, and just a totally weak response to a simple (and very ordinary) request that would have resulted in a purchase. If you are thinking that the lack of attention was due to a busy restaurant, I want to clarify that we were sat at the end of a rush. The restaurant quickly cleared during our meal.

The only salvation was the food, which was great as usual. I'm thankful for that. 

I'm so happy that this isn't the nearest Babbo location to me. I'm hoping this negative visit can be attributed to an inexperienced staff as well. If I'm nearby again, I will likely give this location another shot, but it sucks that this experience ruined what would have been a sure thing."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in surprise! Nice atmosphere, its a Italian eatery. I ordered the chicken limone and it was excellent! The menu gives you a great selection of sandwiches, pizzas and pasta dishes. Def recommend giving this place a visit. Wait staff was prompt and enthusiastic."}
{"text":"By far the best Italian food I've eaten in a long time, this is coming from a picky Italian. Plenty of options for your particular palate, gluten friendly menu items include pasta, salads, and now I'm told that they have a cauliflower pizza crust! Service was excellent and the management team seemed truly on their \"A\" game. I will return here hungry for more!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian spot! I've been coming to babbo for over ten years and I'm I glad they have tons of locations now! Great food, great atmosphere, and amazing service. Toughest part is trying to decide on what to order."}
{"text":"For what it is, this place is pretty decent, its like a fast food Italian place, only you sit down. So not really fast food...but its no upscale Italian eatery. 

We ordered the artichoke, shrimp and crab dip to start. It should just be called artichoke dip, as the shrimp and crab was very lacking...maybe 5 little bits in there. 

I ordered a Mista side salad and it was soooo heavily loaded down with crap, sometimes less is more! 

Now, the dinner was pretty tasty! I got the roasted Brussels sprout and pancetta pasta, heavenly!!! Though i wish they would have put MORE Brussels sprouts and less pancetta, but over all pretty decent. 

We enjoyed it and will probably go back again."}
{"text":"This is actually my second trip to Babbo Italian Eatery. We ventured in last night on the recommendation of a friend and we were not disappointed. I had checked out the website and saw that there were other locations, so I figured it had to be decently good, and the prices were reasonable. I was expecting it to be at least on par with Olive Garden, but boy was I wrong. It's way better, and less expensive to boot. (granted, you don't get the salad, but I wasn't missing it)

For starters, the bread they serve is addictive. It's baked fresh and topped with salt pepper, Italian herbs, and red onion. Add to it the olive oil and balsamic vinegar and I can't get enough. For my entree, I had the Italian Sausage dish, which was loaded with sausage, peppers and mushrooms in a red sauce served over penne. The sausage was spicy, but flavorful - the way it should be. The service was great, and even though it was really busy, we didn't feel forgotten. Once we had ordered our meal, the next thing we knew, the waiter was bringing us our food. That was surprising. It was piping hot and loaded with flavor. I was looking forward to leftovers the next day, even though there wasn't much.

Tonight, I had the Stuffed Manicotti, which comes with either the Italian sausage or portobello mushroom ragu. I ended up getting the Italian sausage and had them add the mushroom (I'm a sucker for both). I cannot even begin to tell you how good it was. All I can say is I have found my new home for casual Italian eating.

With their excellent food, awesome service, elegant ambiance, and great prices, I will be back to explore more of their tantalizing menu. Living within biking distance doesn't hurt either. ;)"}
{"text":"Going to have to give Babbos 1 star now. On my previous review I gave them 3. Management responded to my previous review and asked me to contact them so that they could \"make up for my visit\". Well guess what, after two lousy emails from \"management\" nothing has been done. It's been 3 weeks and they have not delivered on any of their promises. Seriously people? What a poor display of customer service."}
{"text":"Foods good, service not so much. It takes forever for them to acknowledge you and get the drink order. Then, it takes forever for them to com back and get your food order. All this at a mostly empty restaurant. I've been in busier establishments with much faster service. They can't even be bothered to refill water. Bunch of lazy servers there."}
{"text":"Always hesitant to try new restaurants, but we decided to give it a try today for lunch!  We were pleasantly surprised!  Everything is reasonably priced, fresh and delish!  I had the Italiano sandwich and substituted regular tomatoes with the Bruschetta tomatoes on it, and it was SOOOO good! My husband had the Prime Rib sandwich, and said it was awesome!  I had the red Sangria, which was wonderful!  Our waiter, a younger gentleman surprised us with his knowledge for wines, and was very refreshing, considering most kids these days could give a crap, and don't know the menu, let alone the wines!  Highly recommend this place, very clean, and well decorated.  Can't wait to return for dinner and try out the pasta, pizza, and the patio!  It's so nice to have a great italian restaurant in the area, I truly hope that it stays at the standard that's it's at now, it's so sad to see places go downhill after they've been open for awhile. My only criticism is that they had paper menus taped up on the window outside, and it looked really tacky, hopefully it's just a temporary fix until a more permanent solution is found."}
{"text":"I'm writing a review to remind myself to never come back. 

This is one of the higher rated places in the area so we decided to do a takeout. 

I ordered the portobello mushroom dish with a side of Caesar salad. 

1) it can well be a personal preference but I'd like the gills off the mushroom. It just looked unappetizing. 

2) the salad, which was supposed to be vegetarian, came with some special protein: a fly.  It was wet and looked mixed in with the salad so it probably came from the kitchen and somehow got trapped in the food prepping process. 

Not gonna go into what happened after I found the fly, but I think that's enough reason for me to never come back again."}
{"text":"Normal 25 minute wait for a table. Once seated never saw the waitress. Once we finally flagged someone down she said she was our waitress, Then she walked away. No offer of water no apology nothing!  She was not friendly at all.  We felt unwelcomed so we got up and left, went to Crust just down road and had a great dinner.  I would love to tell you the food was great but we didn't even make it that far."}
{"text":"Attentive & friendly service,  delicious food with a chef willing to try new ideas,  variety in menu,  food arrived at table within 10 min., very reasonable prices that dont break the bank... 2 full entrees, 2 glaases wine, dessert & coffees for under $60."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more. I have heard good things and I know they have been in the valley for a while but in the end it was not worth it. The pasta sauces tasted like something you would buy if you were budget shopping at the dollar store. The only real good thing was the bread as it was very soft and had a great taste but the oil and vinegar needed seasoning."}
{"text":"went here the other day. Fantastic food great service and a good atmosphere. The portions were good the flavors were fantastic. I had the spicy Alfredo and my wife had the regular both are great. The only thing I can say negative is that a side salad was $3.95 ridiculous for a 70 to 90 cent salad."}
{"text":"In all fairness to this locally owned restaurant, I won't give out 5 stars unless I have fully experienced a restaurant and for me that means apps to entrees with a desert kicker.

I will give it my highest ranking of 4 stars based on my initial experience based on service, a cold afternoon libation and having an opportunity to try one of their meatballs which was was highly recommended by a good friend.

I would like to believe that there are many others like me that long for the days of non-corporate chains, where one can enjoy family recipes and conversation that amounts to more than either \"do you want fries with that\" or some other stock phrase that the waiter/waitress use that offers nothing more than blah, blah, bla, blah.......

In sum, i would have to say that the meatball was every bit as great as my friend said it was; It was moist, perfectly cooked and neither looked nor tasted as though it came out of freezer - One of the best ones that I have had in Phoenix in a long, long time.....Kuddos!!!!!

As for service, this is another huge issue of mine, in that I think it's a dying aspect of American business from retail to restaurants - especially in the world of restaurants -- why is that?  I mean really, I can have Italian at home or take out from a restaurant, don't people still enjoy the experience of going out which includes both good food and excellent, personable staff.  Maybe it's because you rarely find people who work in restaurants for more than a few months at a time, but with the track record of the employes i met, I can only believe that the owners care and, in turn, so do the employees. 

On the service end I might even go as far to offer a 5 star rating, since service and personal experience can be rated with a 30 minute visit on a Sunday afternoon.  In fact, I will give it a 5 star ranking.  Not only was Maria fun, personable and an excellent conversationalist, but also very good behind the bar (although probably a little self-deprecating when rating her own bar keeping talents).

I look forward to visiting the Babbo location, closer to my office in Scottsdale, after work later this week to get the full experience later this week.

Keep up the GREAT JOB!!!!!  Denis"}
{"text":"Tasty food -- my family and I come here every now and then (we don't eat out too often).  The food is fresh, the right amount of flavor and simple -- the way Italian food should be.  The service is professional and accommodating; when they're busy it takes a little too long for our liking to be served, though.  Try this place out!"}
{"text":"I'd give 1-star for service, which was awful. The food was good.  I ordered LARGE napa salad, hubs ordered small Mista salad + calzone. 

We both received SMALL salads, after 15mins. They were both excellent. I told manager I'd ordered a large, she said \"no problem I can get you a large one.\"  No problem!? Is that her position to say that? But we'd waited so long and hadn't eaten all day, so I accepted my small. Figured I'd have a bite of my husbands calzone.

Wrong. The calzone never came. The manager and the server never came back to check on us. They were eventually involved in a bill dispute with a large party who was charged for a Napa salad they claimed they didn't have (it was probably mine....) 

We flagged manager down eventually, she asked if everything was good. We said no...we'd been there 55ins and our calzone never came. She said she didn't see one on order and she'd check on it; we said forget it, it's 9pm we're ready to go home (and they don't reheat well). 

10mins later she came back with a boxed up calzone. We said no, she said \"ok! I didn't charge you for it.\"

And that's when I said she owes us an apology. We didn't get our MEAL. And what they did serve wasn't right. 

Only then did she apologize. And now's that for sincere? She brought out bill and said she gave the managers discount. Um....thanks? A 10% discount...gee thanks. 

So the two salads were good though. Wouldn't know about the calzone. We just moved back to the hood and we're excited to go back to our local hangout. 

Prob won't be our local hangout anymore."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I've had the same experience as some others who wrote reviews. I thought I had found my \"go to\" place. The food, service and price were all perfect. I loved it. But then I went with a newly met couple. I talked Babboo's up to them, but we were not even waited on until we sat waiting in the patio for 45 minutes. The server argued the point saying it wasn't really 45 minutes (it was), because that didn't include the time we waited outside before being seated. We ordered and still did not get our food for at least another half hour. We were then told it was because one of us ordered something that took a long time to make. Also, when my friend asked about the heat in a menu item she was told to go hot or go home. Lovely. Odd that the level of service dropped so much and so suddenly. I think some people need to be replaced or many customers will find a less stressful and negative experience."}
{"text":"I was very excited for this location to open as it is very close to my home. Unfortunately, I had a hair in my salad AND in my pasta. My food was taken off my bill and the manager offered to have them make me something else, but after having hair in two dishes I could not even imagine eating at this establishment."}
{"text":"3 cheese mac-n-cheese is so good I can't even get anything else! And it's nice you can switch your pasta to whole wheat for no charge! Great food and nice looking place after the remodel. It can get a bit noisy though..."}
{"text":"I love Babbo. There are two locations, one at 67the and the 101 and the one out here in Surprise.

Upon sitting down you are greeted with warm bread that has a few onions and a hit of salt on top. It is good alone or dipped in oil and vinegar. 

They have a few really good appetizers. The bruchetta romana is amazing! Do yourself a favor and try it. The firecracker rolls are tasty but beware when they say spicy marinara they mean it! The toasted ravioli come in a sausage ragu which is beyond packed with sausage. 

All of the pasta I have tried has been good. The bowl o' bolognese is great and one of the best bowls of spaghetti I have had. The sauce is full of meat and is just yummy. Their fresh tomato mozzarella is nice and light with tons of fresh tomatoes and chunks of mozzarella. Their calzones and pizza is also very good.

They have a big menu and everything we have tried we really liked which makes it harder to chose the next time we come. Another great thing is their prices. Expect to pay $5-7 for appetizers, $5-$9 for dinner salads (half or full),  sandwiches, calzones, and pizzas will run you $8-$10, and I think the most pastas are in the $9-$11 range. The portions are a good size and the service is quick.

If you haven't tried this place yet and you are in Surprise, defiantly give it a try!"}
{"text":"Ambience was good, seated promptly and waited on. Waitress came back and said the diet coke was not working did we want to order. Wife ordered lasagna and she said they were out, wife said chicken parmesan, she said they were out of chicken. It is 5:30 on Friday evening, we got up and went to fat Willy's where they had everything listed on the menu. What a concept"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to another visit and sorry to say we wish we hadn't returned. They must have a new chef since nothing was even close to what we had on out first visit. The salads are now in thumb nail sized chunks. The pasta really el dente and everything has excessive amount of pepper. We got tired of waiting for the check and had to go up front and tell the person at the cash register that we didn't have a check to which he asked \"Did you dine with us tonight\". Guess he has a lot of people come up and tell him they haven't dined and still would like a check. We might go back and just stick to pizza and tell them NO pepper."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, especially since several others rave about this place.

The positive - AWESOME WAIT STAFF!  Very attentive and right there giving a 5-star service. The bread was good and the olive oil - balsamic vinegar tasted wonderful.

I was there for lunch last Friday.  I had the Chicken Marsala.  The chicken was cooked great.  The mushrooms were so-so.  I could not taste any Marsala in the chicken or mushrooms.  I am not sure if they added it or not.  The vegetables were over cooked and \"crispy\" and really did not have any flavor.

I think if I ever go back, I will stick to the basics - Pasta or Pizza."}
{"text":"Spaghetti and meatballs has always been my favorite here and it's fantastic!  I've also tried the firecracker rolls which are super delicious as well!  Definitely a big fan of this place!"}
{"text":"I had catering from here about 3 months ago at work and loved it and have literally been dreaming about it ever since.  I can't afford to eat out often but today I decided to treat myself and ordered lunch from here.  It was just a to-go order but everyone was very nice and friendly and the atmosphere was inviting.  I ordered the mushroom and asparagus pasta and loved it but the bread was over the top amazing.  The portions were big enough that I can get 2 meals out of it.  I'm literally sitting here eating leftover bread while typing this and in heaven.  I would definitely go back here again next time I can treat myself."}
{"text":"So, me and my girlfriend were looking for an Italian restaurant to celebrate a promotion and we came across this place. 

Let me just say that this place is absolutely delicious with reasonable prices. Our server was very knowledgeable and knew the items on the menu very well. She stayed on top of the complimentary bread when we were getting low, and very quick with our drinks. 

We decided to sit outside to enjoy the weather, however should've stayed inside due to 1. The amount of flies that we constantly had to run off, and 2. The lack of privacy as the tables are pretty close and the children that were playing with the waterfall next to us. I will not deduct something like that from my stars however because that's out of the restaurants control. However, I will deduct 1 star due to how long it took to receive our check and return our card back to us. Other than that this place is great and will return again. I will sit inside next time for a better experience and hopefully update my review to 5 stars."}
{"text":"My wife's birthday and she choses the best Italian good I have ever had. The toasted ravioli with the spicy sausage meat sauce as an appetizer and the Alfredo makes the most exhilarating and enjoyable time. Hats off to our server who treated like we were royalty. Thanks for a wonderful meal and keep up the great job."}
{"text":"Went again, live nearby.  We were seated, do not sit in back, a/c will leave you freezing and your food gets cold fast.  Had a young server.  The table next to us was seated 10 minutes after we were, and apparently she was not paying attention.  She got their drinks first and after 5 or more minutes, she finally acknowledged us.  Waited for a beer for another 7-8 minutes, then let her know we were ready to order.  Got our dinners, but had to flag her down as she was attending the next table for a second soda.  She never returned to ask my husband if he would like another beer.  We had leftovers \"to go\", and I asked for an extra side of sauce for my calzone.  She brought me an empty container.  Where is the management watching over the tables ?? I used to be a server, and I could not believe the lazy attitude of some of the servers.
Babbo -  you need to have better training of your servers."}
{"text":"Service was really good, and certainly no complaints there.  Tipped her well, too, cause she was so efficient.
BUT, I ordered the steak and blue salad....what a disappointment.  Steak is crumbles (literally) of some dried looking meat that looked like it was left over from yesterday, and the blue?  Well, I had about 1.5 level tablespoons of it which was really stingy since I got the bigger salad.  However, the bottom of the salad was surprisingly loaded with walnuts which I loved.
The dressing was some light light vinegarette and could hardly taste it.  One thing they do right is use romaine cut up and not iceberg....that I did like.
Overall, ok but wouldn't get it again.
My companion got the garlic shrimp alfredo and said is was just meh.  He ate it, but he wouldn't order that again.
I read thru the reviews before going here, and some rave about it and some were one star.  I can see why.  
Place was just meh overall to me, and I would never make an effort to go here again--altho in all fairness, it loaded up (and I mean loaded up) on Friday starting at about 5 pm, so somebody loves this place....just not me."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place on my way home from work. Called ahead for takeout. The Spaghetti was phenomenal, amazing tatse, great price! Next time I come in I will have to stay and eat rather than take home."}
{"text":"Babbo's did a wonderful job catering our wedding this weekend.  We got so many complements on the food.  The staff were very easy to work with and were responsive to our questions.  We live on the west side of the valley and got married on the east side of the valley so I was a little worried at first with trying to set food up on the other side of the valley, but there was no need to worry.  I would highly recommend Babbo's to anyone, from the tasting to the reception they were fabulous to work with."}
{"text":"We had a party of 6 and we decided to eat a somewhat early dinner last night.  When we placed our order of chicken breast on the chalk board menu they told of me they were out of chicken.  My husband tried to order the black and blue salad and they told him they were out of steak.  I'm not sure how in the world they can be out of 2 proteins before 6pm.  I'm not sure if this restaurant has switched hands but we most definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my boyfriend and daughter for her hour lunch break I was concerned she wouldn't have time to eat, but we had plenty of time to eat and have coffee afterwards. The food was delicious, especially that bread! YUM!! I had to take a To Go container,which I appreciated was made of quality so it didn't spill olive oil in my car. The only reason there were 4 stars, and not 5 is because my boyfriend's coffee was cold. Mine was not, so I can only speculate how that happened. They did quickly correctly"}
{"text":"Babbo's has been within spitting distance of my house for awhile now. I've seen the billboards and passed the restaurant many times. Unfortunately, from past experiences, I know what to expect when it comes to these Italian chains - and it definitely ain't much. So, why bother? Nevertheless, due a desire to stay close to home on a Friday, my girlfriend and I reluctantly agreed to give them a try. Sometimes a place can surprise us.

Unfortunately, this was not one of those times.

Okay. So, Babbo's is basically your general run-of-the-mill Italian place that falls somewhere in between mid-tier and dirt cheap. It's sit-down, but not really fancy - which means it's perfect for people seeking just a basic night out with the family. And with the way I see it, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

If you're into places like Cuciana Tagliani (cringe) or Olive Garden (double cringe), then you'll possibly be able to appreciate what's offered here. But if you've ever had truly phenomenal pasta, then you're more or less wasting your time. And no, before I get blasted for my criticisms, I'm not comparing Babbo against fancy high-end Italian restaurants. I'm talking local joints that offer spectacular handmade pasta built from the ground up for similar prices. And believe it or not, there's a great one located not too far from here - but I'm no advertiser, so I won't start name dropping.

Anyway, we started with their complimentary bread, served with the usual olive oil and balsamic. They were generous with the bread, with the server even bringing out an additional plate due to the extended wait time for our pastas. I thought it was okay, while my girlfriend disliked it due to some kind of strange rosemary-ish seasoning they use (despite actually liking rosemary itself). I don't know.

For pastas, we shared the spaghetti and meatballs, as well as a plate of alfredo supremo with chicken added. These are the most basic of basic pasta dishes. Making them is the equivalent of asking a (typical) five year-old to count to ten.

The spaghetti had absolutely zero flavor depth - and I do mean zero! The sauce was comparable to water with a bit of red tint to remind you that tomato is somehow involved - although I'm not quite sure how. We were both very disappointed, despite already having low expectations going in. The meatballs, however, were actually decent. We paid full price, but I understand there's a 5.99 special on Monday and Tuesday. Honestly, I'm not even sure if it's even worth the bargain offer.

My alfredo had similar results. It was just so-damned-bland, I just can't figure out any other way to describe it. I immediately started tracing back to some of the other places we've had pasta recently. I honestly don't get it, but maybe we've just become too spoiled in recent years. Everything, from the sauce, chicken, and pasta itself, lacked any presence whatsoever. I ate maybe a third of the plate before ultimately surrendering and accepting my failure.

For dessert, we reluctantly ordered their cookie, which is similar to the Pizookie/pizza cookie variations you'll find at a variety of modern restaurants. It's a failsafe choice and a creation that is usually consistently done well, regardless of where you go. After waiting a good twenty minutes, the waitress informed us that the kitchen burned the first one (thank God they didn't bring it out), so our dessert would be delayed. We eventually received one and will say that it was good enough for them to receive an extra star. Not quite as gooey and semi-cookied as most are, but more on par with what you'd find with a soft baked cookie with ice cream. We both liked it for what it was. So yes, there was a positive to the experience.

Overall, I can't say it's a place we'd return to, nor is it a place I'd really recommend. But like I said, there's obviously a crowd for this type of food, as the place was quite busy.

Unfortunately, we're just not a part of that crowd, I guess.

Perhaps it's time I move out of Arrowhead?"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the Monday and Tuesday $5.00 Spaghetti and Meatballs.  They have several other menu items and we've tried a few but ya can't go wrong with an easy Monday night dinner of Spaghetti & Meatballs.  The portion is big enough for hubby and I to share but I sometimes opt for lunch leftovers and get one for all of us.
One tip, if you like your s'ghetti with more than a tinting of sauce you might want to let them know.  Too often I have arrived home with spaghetti and meatballs and the pasta appeared and tasted like the sauce had been lightly brushed across.  The marinara or gravy is one of the most nutritious portions of the this dish and we all could us a couple more Tablespoons.
I really like the the Roasted Brussel Sprout Salad for a change of pace.  One time the Brussels Sprouts were over cooked which made them bitter, but even then I enjoyed the blend with those tiny veggies, salad mix, and beets too.
The Happy Hour is mediocre and I have to you that the Margarita I had last time I was there was THE worst.  My son tasted it and even he doubted there was a whole shot of alcohol in the drink and it tasted like it was made with a lesser quality mix.   Service has always been pleasant and fairly prompt too.  
We keep coming back because it has been an quick, reasonably priced, easy and consistent option."}
{"text":"For the price it is ok, but it is chain food and on par with chain quality. Service was great. Waitress was very kind and attentive. She dealt with our complaint about one of the dishes by promptly fetching an alternative. Deserved a max tip. Food is mediocre at best, obviously the product of a chain kitchen. Had a roast vegetable plate from the back of the menu. It was supposed to be pesto with chicken and roast vegetables. Was awful. The chicken was dry, and the pesto tasted like nothing more than basil in oil. Could not taste any blend of parmesean, pine nuts or anything else. Worst of all were the vegetables. Pretty sure culinary schools don't include a course on charred broccoli, but there it was. Black and bitter as can be. Anyone can make a mistake, but there is no excuse for letting it out of the kitchen. To their credit when we complained they replaced it with a meatball sandwich. Mista salad is a good mix, but subject to the sin of cut lettuce instead of shredded pieces. This is not the only place that does it and it is a minor point to some, but lettuce cut into thin strips is more like a garnish than a salad. Wild mushrooms with garlic cream sauce was ok, though the sauce is a bit more watery than the menu would suggest and there were only 5 or 6 bits of mushroom. Wild or not I couldn't tell. Chain food on par with chain quality and chain price. Definitely not a destination restaurant for us, but ok if you need to eat and it is the nearest thing that comes up on the GPS."}
{"text":"I've tried Babbo three times now.   Each and every time has been consistently middle of the road.  The food isn't bad nor is it great.  There is nothing special about any experience I had here..  I guess if you're looking for an \"Okay\" place to eat Babbo will fit the bill.  Very Pedestrian..."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food was great but it took forever to get our server to come to the table just to great us. She wasn't any faster at bringing us our drinks either. I know how busy a restaurant can be and I'm pretty patient. But this was just ridiculous. But like I said, the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Their food is fabulous! I highly recommend the \"Chicken Artichoke Calzone! Also, they have great Lunch Combo Daily Specials:)"}
{"text":"The food here is rest but he service is very slow. My wife and I have eaten here many times including their last location and since they changed they seem to be unorganized and understaffed. We have waited at the door for 5 minuets without anyone acknowledging us to even say it will be a few minuets. We have sat at the bar which no one tends most of the time so people who sit after us get taken care of before us. This place just needs to get their service up and at least great the customers and serve them faster. This does not take away their food as it does taste amazing and this is the only location we have have had this issue."}
{"text":"Once again, Lauri,and her team killed it. We Come to this restaurant at least five times per month, let alone the amazing food the service is outstanding! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This could be the single most pathetic Italian restaurant in Scottsdale.  The one bright spot was the pre-meal bread with oil and balsamic vinegar.  The service was slow and the meals we ordered tasted like we were eating at a hospital cafeteria.  Go to Andreoli or Pomo instead."}
{"text":"Monday's and Tuesday's for spaghetti and meatballs.  Doesn't get any better than this.  Nice new building and decor.  I always sit at the bar and love this place.  All the other food is great as well but can't beat the $5.95 deal for spaghetti."}
{"text":"Ugh. Slow service; lackluster food at best, and barely edible at worst... i've eaten there several times over the years, and nothing has improved... i won't go back."}
{"text":"On my way home I saw those annoying \"Spaghetti you won't forghetti\" ads that Babbo has on some valley billboards.  Although I disapprove of their puntastic ads, a cheap plate of spaghetti and meatballs sounded good, so the wife and I went to visit the location right down the street from us for an early dinner.  What a disappointment.

Location:

Located in a shopping complex near a Fry's.  Ample parking.  The exterior was ugly like the Fry's.  Inside was modern Italian eatery... like a darker, less obnoxious olive garden.  

Service:

The service was off to a good start.  We came in and were seated right away by a polite hostess.  Sadly, the service nosedived.  We sat at our table with not so much as a glass of water.  After fifteen minutes and several dozen wait staff passing by, I got up and asked the hostess to please let the waiter know we were there, thinking that it was simply a communication issue.  It was not.  We waited an additional 7 minutes before a waiter came to take our order.  Not only did he get our drink order wrong, he also could not remember who in our party ordered what.  There were only two of us.  It was not that hard.  The best thing about the waiter is that the only other time we saw him was when I handed him our card and asked him to just run it.

Food:

The food at Babbo is fine.  I had the spaghetti and meatball special.  The meatballs are big, not too anisey, and have a good texture.  Spaghetti was a little overcooked, but no more than any other casual Italian place would do.   The sauce was excellent - tangy, fresh, and with a strong hint of basil.  My wife had the steak panino.  It was not as good.  It's essentially flat foccacia bread with flank steak and cheese on top.  The bread was super soggy and the whole thing could've used more meat.  The panino came with zucca chips which were acceptable, but not as good as the ones served up at North in Scottsdale.

Price:

The spaghetti and meatballs are like a recession special.  Everything else is average priced.  Mondays and Tuesdays are apparently when the meatballs are on the cheap.

Conclusion:

Terrible, awful service which the acceptable food does not make up for.  We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Lunch was great. Got the steak and blue cheese salad.  Nice change and waiter.  A little noisy but it was during lunch."}
{"text":"Pasta? Head here on a Monday or Tuesday night and get spaghetti and meatballs for half price. What a deal. That's what brought us back for our second visit. 

Our first visit I had their version of chicken picatta.  Wow.  I love lemon and capers.  The chicken was very yummy.  This dish was so very good. My friend had the mac and cheese and all I can say is it was some of the best stuff ever. 

We've tried both the chicken ceaser and chopped wedge salads and they are both very good. They aren't over dressed and have a nice ratio for ingredients. 

This past visit we did the spaghetti and meatballs. I substituted the zoodles for pasta and I think I'm never going to have it with pasta. Wow it was good. The meatballs are giant. Like I said it's on special Monday and Tuesday. 

They have some happy hour specials as well so I'll have to head back over for that soon. They had a fundraiser for PCH not long ago and that's when we saw them on the news and decided to try them. What a great local business. Thanks Babbo."}
{"text":"Great food. Waiter needs to find a new profession. Service not good. Thank God they have good food ."}
{"text":"I really love having this place nearby. It's yummy, with nice decor and the prices are not bad at all."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant and the food is AMAZING!! my favorite is the three cheese mac n cheese.. BUT whenever I go on a Sunday and sometimes Saturday they tell me they don't have cookie dough for the giant cookies, and my food takes an extremely long time to come out and when I asked the server said \"well we ran out of the cheese sauce so we had to run to Safeway to buy some\". Little odd."}
{"text":"I guess I should update my last review because we eat lunch here often and I'm starting to feel guilty.   I love the lunch specials. Pasta and a salad.  Mushrooms and asparagus a creamy sauce. Yum.   Just enough and with the bread and olive oil, it's almost too much.  The service is good, the place is clean and the food is hearty and good.   We will be back, well, we are back and will be back again."}
{"text":"I would give more stars because I truly love the food here, however the service wasn't as satisfactory. My fiancé and I were taken to a booth by the manager, (who didn't even greet us) and she laid down the menus and without a word walked away without waiting for us to get to the booth and sit down. Usually your supposed to get \"your server will be right with you\" but she acted like she needed to be somewhere else. So right off the bat my fiancé and I felt unimportant. Usually we don't mind these types of things however we found it unacceptable because it was a manager. My fiancé and I have been working in the restaurant industry since we were seventeen and were always taught the importance of customer service, and how important the beginning of a dinning experience is. My point is, we felt like we were an annoyance instead of welcomed."}
{"text":"We wanted to take advantage of their happy hour and found the food choices to be good for happy hour, drinks not so much.  I don't see how $3 for a bud light is really a deal.  The way to go would be the 2 for $25 deal which includes 2 salads, 2 small entrees ( either pasta or pizza), and 2 glasses of wine.  

The food is really good, the service was not.  The food took over 30 min and the restaurant was empty considering we arrived at 5.  We wanted to order another round of drinks on happy hour and our server told us we just missed it. Really?  Why didn't you come remind us it was ending!?"}
{"text":"Recently remodeled, same menu.  Same good food with even better atmosphere, decor, lighting and more space in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over, and expecting a different result. Three years later, I end up going on the uber busy spaghetti and meatballs night AGAIN! The snowbirds flock (seriously they flock) to this place for a hefty serving of a Midwest fave for $6.99, so come after 6 on a mon/tues if you don't want to wait. 

I felt the need to give a star back last night. Not only did they get us in rather quickly, service had greatly improved. Everyone was helpful and I truly enjoyed my French 75 cocktail and roasted red pepper and mushroom pasta. They have a new pasta dish with buffalo chicken and gorgonzola sauce. Great concept, but it needed more. Get rid of the broccoli and add some scallions and more heat. Then again, the little lady next to me was complaining her meatballs were too spicy, so I get it **eyeroll**. We'll come back...probably on meatball night."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch with my lovely wife. We were seated right away, and server came out right after. Very polite service. My wife and I were very impressed with the food. We ordered from the happy hour menu for $25 for couples combo which included 2 glasses of wine, 2 salads, and 2 pastas. I have to say they were all really good. My wife was very impressed with everything that was served here. I ordered pasta valducci,and my wife ordered pasta Rustico. They were both flavorful. The house merlot wine was good as well. We also ordered the mista salads, which were delicious as well. Glad to dine here, and will be when ever I'm in the area :) Good job guys, keep it up and God Bless..."}
{"text":"Had a decent happy hour, $5 drinks and $6 happy hour, which is a couple dollars off. I had the chipotle chicken pasta and it was amazing. All our meals has a large portion to them. They also have complimentary bread and oil, which is fresh and truly delicious."}
{"text":"I can say that this was the worst food I have eaten in a very long time.  Horrible, absolutely horrible. I use yelp for most of my dining selections. I have never wrote a review, but this place is horrible and I hope I save someone from wasting their money and time."}
{"text":"Before going here I posted on Facebook to see if anyone had been here before and if they liked it. I had a lot of positive feedback from my friends on Facebook and I read yelp reviews which were almost all positive. So we decided to go. Let me tell you, I'm so glad that we did! This was such an awesome dining experience. The food was so good and our waiter was so great! We will be back here again and again. We have lived in the area for 13 years and I never knew that this place was around the corner. I got roasted chicken with wild mushroom marsala. It was so good! I got the spring mix salad and my husband got a giant sausage pepperoni and mushroom calzone. My daughter got the mac & cheese and it was also good. It had croutons in it and pieces of bacon. The bread that they serve prior to the meal was unbelievable! The portions are huge so we have leftovers to bring home. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for better Italian food than Olive Garden, Rigatoni's, and Marcellos which is a place in Chandler. I think it is right up there next to Carabba's and maybe even a little better!"}
{"text":"We went to the new Scottsdale location and Aiden was our server who executed exemplary service!
We ordered drinks immediately and were also greeted with fresh focaccia bread!
The Babbo-Tini is delicious as were the Firecracker Rolls. The steak flavor was our favorite.
I had the Chicken Limone, which was light and refreshing. Hubby opted for the Italian Sausage Pasta, which was simple and delicious. 
We each ordered a dessert, I had the Affogato which had s wonderful STRONG espresso, and my husband ordered the Tiramisu. I ate ALL of his, and most of mine!
The restaurant is clean and beautifully decorated, but still a very welcome, casual, come-as-you-are environment. 
We loved our visit and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time eating at Babbo. Brandon was our waiter, he was very Pleasent and friendly. He did a super job!  The food was delicious, we usually go to Olive Garden. The food at Babbo was top notch and levels above what Olive Garden delivers. We will be back. The only draw back was the restaurant was extremely warm, I felt sorry for the workers."}
{"text":"The surprise location did not disappoint in the food Babbo has to offer. The restaurant was busy and we waited about 15 mins for a seat. It would be nice if they had a few more booths. They data booth with a four top BUT only one person was present. The rest of the party showed up 15 minutes after he was seated. Note to the owner- its frustrated to see this kind of seating practice. I'm a believer of not seating a party until the entire group is present. This is the reason for my 4 star rating. 

The food was delicious and the service was good. The waiter worked really hard to take care of his tables."}
{"text":"This place is my absolute favorite we have been here 3 plus times. I live near by, their bread is delish and the staff is always friendly the wait is not long. Just a authentic taste to the food and it is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I had been reading the reviews. I finally decided to give it a try. 
I came in on a Monday, around 4:00 pm. When I walked in, I noticed the place to be clean, and orderly. There was already a decent crowd there. 
I was greeted by a waitress, who let me sit where I wanted. 
As I looked around, I noticed patrons, eating like it was their last meal. They were eating, from what I could tell , spaghetti. When I read the reviews, I saw they had a special spaghetti dinner on Monday and Tuesday.  
My waitress arrived. Very nice, and friendly (Alexandra). She took my order ( I decided on the special) and a salad. 
She brought a plate of fresh baked bread. Enough to to choke two horses. She also brought a plate of oil and vinegar, for dipping. 
The salad was fresh, and very tasty. When my dinner arrived, it had two \"great big O\" meatballs with it. The meatballs were a meal in it self. 
The pasta was made to perfection, and the sauce was also very tasty. The meatballs were moist, and very flavorful. 
I highly recommend Babbo. 
By the way, the dinner is only $5.99, dine in or take out. Such a deal!"}
{"text":"Flabbergasted at the awful service. Well actually, not flabbergasted because out of the last four times we've visited this restaurant (near our house) they have either been out of what we ordered (the first time pepperoni, the second time CHICKEN BREAST at 7pm, by the way on a Friday night!) or they have seated us and not acknowledged that we were there, or they have gotten our order wrong. Last night was the final straw. Paid $48 for a chicken parm dish that tasted like the chicken was frozen, a kids pizza, and a large salad that I had to order after being told they were out of chicken (which took them 15 minutes to realize) No silverware, no drink refills, no napkins! We had to get up twice to ask for things and best yet... no manager came over to ask how things were! Such a shame because it could be a cute neighborhood restaurant. Wasn't going to post a review, but after reading all the other similar reviews I felt it was necessary."}
{"text":"Really good place if you are looking for something different and are going with people who want the same old thing. They have the classics like spaghetti and meatballs and some creative dishes. I got a pasta with prosciutto and Brussels sprouts and it was really good. 

Make sure you get there early cause it's kinda small dining area and fills up fast, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"All thumbs up for this place, we came in before the dinner rush at 16:10 and the stuffed Manicotti the wife had was excellent and my spaghetti and meatballs was excellent as well. Recommend this place to everyone! Thanks for the great service Olivia!"}
{"text":"We just dined at Babbo for the second time (First at their new location).  We went on a Monday evening and knew it would be busy because of their Spaghetti and Meatballs special ($6.99) but were willing to wait the 45 mins for a table.  They have the most welcoming 'waiting' area, complete with comfy chairs and an outdoor fireplace.  I am one of those people who despise being crammed in a tiny waiting room where it's loud and you can't even visit.  Not here!  Nice and quiet!  
The inside of this restaurant is quite large.  A lot larger than their other locations we've been to.  By the time we were seated (7 or so) the rush had passed and the place was perfect for dining and conversation.
The service was PHENOMENOL!  I wish I could remember our server's name.  He was excellent.  All the food ordered was superb. The bread they give you to start is delicious as well.
Definitely an experience worthy of 5 stars!  And I love their expansive menu, can't wait to return and try something new!"}
{"text":"We had our wedding catering tasting here and the food is fantastic. We cannot wait for them to cater our wedding next February. Dustin was very pleasant to work with and we loved the added service of boxing up the tasting leftovers for us."}
{"text":"Wanted a table for 5.     They refused.     We are clean cut professional's.  Generally 30-35% tippers.  Looking for a nice dinner with a couple bottles of wine.   
Evidently, they didn't want our money and thats okay.  We will find other restuarants that want our money"}
{"text":"Awesome bread and meatball sandwich.  Tiramisu is more like bread pudding, weird consistency.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for several years now and they are simply the best little Italian place. The Devore is always changing and stunning. They have impeccable service and I love their food! This is my husband and I's \"place\" if you know what I mean. Try them out and if your not a fan of what you order try something else. They have food for many different tastes and I highly recommend trying lots of different stuff. Oh and join their loyalty text group for coupons and special deals!"}
{"text":"Just found out about their Mon and Tue special.  Spaghetti and meatballs for $5.99.  Large portion of spaghetti and two huge meatballs loaded with delicious sauce.  Best deal in town.  

Great service yoo.  Nicole is one of the best waitresses I have ever had.

Love it."}
{"text":"We went there for a birthday celebration and had superb food and service. They even were able to make a meal that was no longer on their menu. My favorite is shrimp valducci. Portions are large plan to take a doggy bag home!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered a small pizza and reg. Steak and blue salad online so all we would have to do is pick it up, no waiting, or so I thought. My husband gets there and the pizza is ready and they haven't even started the salad which he waited 35 min for...really? He brings it home and the pizza is completely cold.(we live 2blocks from the place) and the salad had about 1/2 cup of of water in the bottom of the container and they completely left the blue cheese off also it just looked gross. And actually tasted gross. So back my husband went. They did remake a margarita pizza however somehow they realized they didn't have any basil??!! Really?? You would think there would be some sort of apology or discount but nope nothing for my husband  having to make two trips for very marginal food. I will absolutely go to fired pie far before going here again. Besides being good tasting food the service is so great!"}
{"text":"Gotta start by I use to love babbos. The one in Surprise won my heart. I moved to city and tried this location after work today. My boyfriend and I waited almost 20 min with tons of tables open. We literally watched employees stand and chst with each other, look at us, and continue their convo like we werent even their. Once seating we did get drinks fast and appetizers fast. We order a Bruschetta board. It was pretty gross. The portions of ingredents where over powering. The strong cheese should be done in smaller portions and it was slapped together in 5 min. Just bad. I looked past it just maybe the huge catering order taken put door 10 min before had somethong to do with appetizer. Nope I order a steak sandwhich minus mushrooms. Im highly allergic. Did make sure to tell waiter looked him in the face serious. My food came back covered in mushrooms. I told him take it back dont want it plz get me my bill. It was a mess of a experience. As a foodie rule one I shpuld of known a restaurant that you can smell trash over the food I should of walked out. The manager a kind woman. Offered to make my food from scratch herself totally upset by her staff. If I can suggest anything as a customer..re train ur kitchen staff go back to basics on recipies or fire them if they dont improve. You have a veru busy location on a saturday and I hears two other customers complain of food and service. You rating on yelp is starting to reflect it."}
{"text":"My first time at Babbo, after hearing a lot of great things. I must say I wasn't disappointed. The atmosphere was okay; nothing too exiting, but it was nice and clean. The service was prompt and attentive. I dine alone quite frequently. Often times, i experience a \"set it and forget it\" attitude from my servers. One they set my food down, they forget about me until its time to pay the bill. My server made sure i had refills, my food tasted good and just a general quality check before dropping off the bill. I had the stuffed manicotti with sausage, and it was great! I just wish they had oil and herbs for the bread, because I don't like balsamic vinegar, but that isn't a deal beaker. I will definitely be back to Babbo, with friends or alone."}
{"text":"I go to the Baboo in Mesa (Signal Butt & US60). Gone several times and I am always satisfied. They have Awesome garlic bread! The spaghetti and meatballs are soooo yummy. I decided to try it since we came on a Tuesday night and that was the special. I was pleasantly surprised! The meatballs were huge and seasoned perfectly.  Spaghetti and meatballs are $7 on Monday and Tuesday nights. The stuffed portobello mushroom is yummy. I husband always gets a pizza and is very satisfied. We have had excellent service every time and the atmosphere is very charming. Perfect for date nights on a budget."}
{"text":"Great food & great service. The staff was very attentive & the food was yummmmmy. I had the Mac & cheese & my husband had the pizza and we were both satisfied. I topped my dinner off with tiramisu and what a delight it was. They have great daily & happy hour deals. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I visited the 67th ave and 101 eatery on 9/9/13. After  i asked for a second plate of the \"all you can eat spaghetti\" they said really!!!! its not all you can eat i explained that i had been told it was an hour prior to arriving via a call to the diner.  the manager said not at all. it (ALL YOU CAN EAT)  was left on the menu cause of the \"great success\" it brought to the company. Then the management wanted to argue after I said i had called and seen it on the internet. she wanted me to show her.then proceeded to blame the yelp people for the advertisement.  MANAGEMENT AND STAFF NEED TO REMEMBER CUSTOMER SERVICE"}
{"text":"It's so great that more sit down restaurants are coming to Surprise. I was never a huge fan of Italian food when I was younger (unless you count pizza), but I'm so glad that's changed. Such a nice restaurant. Looks more high end and classy to me. I loved the light fixtures and different decor. When we went it was after lunch rush and was still very busy.  It was very loud in the bar area so we opted to sit in the back room near the fireplace which was perfect. I decided on the Buffalo Chicken with broccoli and it was amazing! A little spicy for me though and won't get again. My son had the biggest plate of spaghetti and meatballs. You should've seen his eyes light up as he ate it. For an appetizer we also ordered spicy rolls. They almost looked too good to eat...I said almost. They were gone in seconds lol"}
{"text":"The food we ordered was very tasty! We got the artichoke crab dip, side salads and pepperoni/sausage/mushroom pizza. My pet peeve is when the sausage has too much star anise in it, but this was perfect; a lot of bite to it, super flavorful. The service was fast and nice, all good!"}
{"text":"Tasty food with no frills. Restaurant is clean, staff is attentive. We usually grab the lunch specials before 3 p.m., typically side salad and pasta. They bring bread with dipping oil and it is delicious. We top it off with a glass of house chianti. We've also frequented the restaurant on N. 67th just north of the 101. Also very nice. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very busy, Hostess was very helpful in opening the door for me and my grandmother that was in a wheelchair!  Our waiter was fast and efficient and our food was outstanding.  Large proportions and can split with one or even two people!  Love the free garlic bread served when you are seated! Parking lot is tricky, only one handicap spot which someone was already in so tough to unload and load someone that is in a wheelchair!  Great experience!!"}
{"text":"Ok....so it's official...this place blows. I went a second time to be sure. Yep; BLOWS! Bad sign when a good number of the reviews on Yelp reference THE OLIVE GARDEN (the quintessential example of mediocrity) as a better option.

We tried to ignore our first trip to Babbo, because they were the new kid on the block, which meant they were busy and likely prone to a mistake or two.1) We ignored the fact that there were empty tables, but we were still told we'd have to wait for a table or sit at the bar (we sat at the bar). 2) We tried to ignore that it took forever for our food to come. 3) We tried to ignore that the PASTA PUGLIA had less flavor than a wet dishrag. 4) We even tried to ignore that our server/bartender's take on our crappy food came 20 minutes after delivery and was literally, \"I didn't notice you weren't eating your food. You should've said something.\"

We waited a year to return....MISTAKE.

This time it was take-out, and we ordered a lot, to be sure; BRUSCHETTA ROMANA, PISATCHIO MOZZARELLA, MUSHROOM-PEPPERONI-SAUSAGE PIZZA, ALFREDO SUPREMO W/CHICKEN, & BABBO'S BOWL O BOLGNESE.

Our online order told us 20 minutes, which is exactly when we arrived, only to be told by a polite young man, named Raphael, that everything was done but our pasta dishes. REALLY?!? 15 minutes later (yep) we were heading home. The timing undoubtedly contributed to some of the earlier dishes being less than great, but really probably not so much as they're just not very good to start with.

BRUSHETTA ROMANA - We appreciate that the Tomato/Basil mixture was separated from the toasted bread for travel, but it didn't matter. The topping mix felt pre-made, soggy, soupy and gross. FAIL!

PISTACHIO MOZZARELLA - Interesting choice, mixing pistachio nuts with your traditional Caprese Salad, and it would have worked, if it WAS a traditional Caprese Salad. It Isn't. This dish isn't what you're expecting in that it really scrimps on the Mozzarella, choosing to drop a few cubes on top, instead of matching the tomatoes slice for slice. Also, drenched in balsamic, the entire dish turned into a soggy mess.

MUSHROOM-PEPPERONI-SAUSAGE PIZZA - Gross, Gross GROSS!!! The crust was flavorless and chewy. The sauce was non-existent. The ingredients were sparse to the point of wondering where they were, including cheese. I'm not sure what they're going for here, but, if it isn't \"REPULSE THE CUSTOMER,\" They're falling miserably short.

ALFREDO SUPREMO W/CHICKEN & BOWL O BOLGNESE - We can combine the pasta dishes because our review is the same for both. The portions are ridiculously small (c'mon guys, it's pasta), and the flavor is unremarkable. A frozen MARIE CALLENDAR'S DINNER would provide a more satisfying dining experience.

It's difficult, in this part of Chandler, to find decent Italian food. I guess, for now, countless reviewers are right; OLIVE GARDEN is a better option."}
{"text":"Went to my favorite Italian place today and I am sad to say that I was disappointed.  Previous visits food was excellent and service was too.  Today however, for starters, the server was incompetent...at least he got the orders right.  First time I have ever sat down with two ladies and been asked to order first.  Had to ask for refills on the drinks and for spoons for the espresso and cappuccini.  Now for the food...taste was fine.  However, two of us had pasta dishes with what should have been \"long\" noodles.  The cook had broken the pasta into short lengths so you couldn't pick it up by spinning the fork...definitely a no-no by my Italian experience.   I will go back but this is strike one..."}
{"text":"So we finally got to Babbo in our 'hood. I know so many people that are fans of this restaurant, particularly their Monday/Tuesday spaghetti and meatball special. We walked right in and had seats at the small bar. It's not my favorite kind of bar seating...it's small and you sit with your back to part of the dining room, but oh well. The bartender was right on it for us with water and a glass of wine (well-priced). I ordered a salad and the Chicken Parmesan Pasta. My partner ordered a pasta. Service was quick and attentive; food was promptly served. (And the bread is delicious.) Now, we understand why Babbo is always busy: good Italian food at good prices in a well-run restaurant. It's added to our list of regular places close to home."}
{"text":"Babbo is quite delicious for Americanized Italian food with fantastic service to boot.

We came in here back in August after spending the day doing maintenance + giving my ride a serious wash, polish and wax job. It was after 9PM, I was sunburnt, exhausted, and cooking was the last thing on my mind.

So Dude drags me here. 

Very cute décor inside, loved the bubble-glass lamps! 

So it looks all snazzy inside. If you feel like Babbo is a place you have to dress up . . . Don't. I was wearing a sundress and wedges; Dude had on shorts and a shirt, and the other diners seemed to reflect this theme. 

Even though it was close to closing time, our server (looked like a college-aged gal) didn't show she was ready to hit the road. Very talkative, friendly, and made plenty of recommendations to us.

In fact, made it a point to bring us freshly made and baked ciabatta bread with an olive oil and balsamic reduction. Carb heaven! 

The Caesar salads were your typical restaurant salad fare. 

I ordered the Pasta Martini (essentially a penne a la vodka) and Dude had the Chicken Chipotle Pasta. 

We both LOVE spicy food, and our server told us the chef could make these dishes extra spicy for us. And boy, did s/he bring the heat! Also, no problem substituting the chicken in my pasta with spicy Italian sausage. 

After tip, no dessert, soda or alcoholic beverages, this was just over $25. 

Was it the best pasta? Definitely not. But so much better than Olive Garden, Carrabbas, or the other garbage-y chains. 

Great to know that Babbo exists when I want a quick, affordable casual dinner."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!  
Reasonable prices, large portions and excellent authentic Italian food and wine.  Oh, and let's not forget the fresh bread!  
Our service was outstanding and our witty server made our experience all the more enjoyable.
I particularly appreciated that he mentioned the sausage dish we had just ordered is typically spicy and that we could request mild sausage if preferred, which someone in our party did do.
I'll be going back the next time I'm in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Mon & Tues special to go is the perfect way to surprise your loved one with a delicious meal without breaking the bank or a sweat. One meal easily feeds two people. If you're not a large eater,  u could find yourself in a comparable situation. I ordered two Mon night specials w bread for an impromptu dinner w 2 other women. This being their first time having Babbos, I hit the ball out of the park! After gushing & complimenting my ability to always know the best spots...haha..we were stuffed & had never opened the 2nd container. Between the three of us we were more than satisfied from one meal. But no one complained about having the extra one bcuz it was such a hit we would've hated to not have leftovers! Kudos to you Babbos for not only having one of the hardest menus to choose from while dining in (everything screams choose me!). But you are the only restaurant I know that gives equal food, taste, service, portion size, and value on your carry out items. I stear clear of take out for this exact reason yet u've shown there are still places that deserve the benefi of doubt..Thank you for knowing if a night at Babbos doesn't fit our schedule, our family is blessed to still enjoy the same delicious meal at our dining table as they would if they were there. You Rock!"}
{"text":"Had a VERY nice time here for our Zuri's Circle meeting today. We stumbled upon this quite little gem. Every thing was DELICIOUS!!! I had Mista salad & the Bianca pizza.....YUUUUUUMMMMMY! Our Very pleasant waitress Emily, was very attentive. We mos def will be returning."}
{"text":"I have nothing but compliments for this place -- wonderful food, great wait staff, flexible/creative menu with lots of options for vegetarians and vegans, handy and intuitive online ordering system, convenient locations, great martinis.....it's ALL good."}
{"text":"great place, Monday and Tuesday are $5,99 spaghetti and meatballs night, luv it"}
{"text":"Loved it! I went for the lasagna and a wedge salad. Definitely could have shared. Great portions and fabulous flavor."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience we just had... Meal was timed perfectly. Service (by Austin) was amazing, Recommendations were spot on! 
We ordered ...
Appetizer:
-Bruschetta Trio(no pic) with Pesto/Salami, Goat Cheese/Red Pepper and Pomodoro selections. All great but eat fast since the bread will get soggy. 
Entrees: 
-Spinach & Gorgonzola Pasta (I could have kicked the bowl, but didn't).
- Build your own Calzone(very large) with Bacon, Tomato & Extra Cheese.
Dessert:
Zeppoli w/Caramel Sauce & Vanilla Ice Cream, which was far better than I expected. I wanted Tiramisu but they were out so this was the recommendation of the waiter. I was hesitant thinking it was just doughnuts with topping...but it was far better; I was not disappointed in the least! So much we shared with our table neighbors (before we ate from it). Must try!"}
{"text":"So, most of my reviews are going to be based on the quality and taste of the food.  I don't find that I experience really bad service or great service that often, most is satisfactory.  
On with the review.  The bread that they bring at the begining was pretty delicious, but sad when that was the best part of the meal.  Most of us had pasta, mine was extremely bland (I had the creamy garlic chicken)  I had to add a lot of salt and I never salt anything.  My fiance had the fresh tomato mozzarella pasta and it was terribly bland also, the tomatoes hardly even had taste.  The only thing in our group of six that seemed to be good was the chopped gorganzola salad. 
I would much rather support a local restaurant than a chain, but I would have to say that I would rather eat at Olive Garden than here."}
{"text":"I say 5 stars for a great consistent Italian place that I first highly underestimated.  I have been coming here for years and would be lying if I didn't tell you that I am addicted to the Napa Valley salad....I know I dont eat salad, but when I do it is this one.  The service is always great here and the atmosphere is really nice considering it is in a Safeway shopping center.  The hot bread they bring out is always gone in seconds since my kids even inhale the bread with oil and vinegar.  I also think that their fettuccine alfredo is one of the best I have ever had.  I dont get it much since I am pretty sure my arteries will get clogged if I do but on a special occasion I will take one for the team.   I probably go here about once per month for my whole family, it is a great place for authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Friendly and attentive server. We tried the meatball sub with zucchini chips and the chicken Limon. My son had the kids meatballs with marinara. All were tasty and very satisfying.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Another great meal @ Babbo ... from the 'chalkboard' menu:  the mista salad, and the portobello mushroom with garlic artichokes and lemon. Plus - the ambiance was nice, service good and the waiter terrific and attentive.  Oh, the wine was nice too."}
{"text":"Food was good but the staff was sluggish, will just take out next time had the 12in pepperoni and bacon. Can't ever go wrong with that"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. The bartender was awesome. Food was ok. Will go back but wouldn't bring out of town guests there as the food was average. The phone was constantly ringing was my only complaint. They do have a patio which is a huge plus! They do give you bread with balsamic and oil before your meal which i am not normally a fan of , however it was very fresh. Again with out the funny bartender, who was very personable and engaging even though we were not drinking, made our night."}
{"text":"I sometimes eat here with my friends after hiking Dreamy Draw Hiking Trail.

Yeah we ruin the burned calories by stuffing our faces with pastas and pizzas at Babbo afterwards.

Is it good? Definitely!

As you sit you are swarmed with servers laying down complimentary breads with olive oil, and balsamic dip.

However, I cannot eat bread and pastas all the time, or I'll gain weight.

I have to watch my svelte figure now that I'm getting older.

They do have an interesting menu and the ones that I've had were extremely flavorful. I've had the Garlic Cheese Crostini, Bruschetta Romana, Roasted Asparagus, Mandarin Spinach, Mushroom Asparagus, and Pasta Rustico. The place is also very clean,  the ambiance is fabulous, and service is always great.

Highly recommended with a great lunch menu too! :-)"}
{"text":"Babbo is always a special treat for me and my husband since we don't live nearby one of their locations. Service is spectacular and it is genuinely the best Italian food we have ever had."}
{"text":"Decided to try something different and so glad we ended up here! By far the best restaurant experience I've had. The service was amazing, the prices can't be beat and the food was delicious! I got the Roasted brussel sprout and pancetta pasta, my boyfriend got the Spicy Alfredo and we got the pick 3 bruschetta as an app. You will never see me at an Olive Garden ever again!"}
{"text":"Increasing to 3 stars.  Went back and had a lovely dinner.  Service was great  and our pasta was delish!"}
{"text":"Love Babbo so much, that they catered our wedding! Their salads are amazing. I am obsessed with the Spicy Green Bean Salad and the Roasted Brussel Sprouts and Beet salad. Not to mention THE BREAD!! Love love love Babbo!"}
{"text":"Babbo had a great atmoshere and the food was good. The waiter wasn't as attentive as i would like."}
{"text":"Date night. We ordered the Bruschetta trio:  Tomato, mozzarella, basil with a balsamic drizzle, Salami,Fig with Argula and blue cheese, Pear walnut and a blend of goat cheese with honey. The bread was hard and not prepared properly, the fig was missing and not at all what Bruschetta is supposed to be. Appearance wise,it was beautiful,but lacked taste. I ordered the Martini pasta which was delicious! My husband ordered the manicotti with a side of meatballs. The sauce was so heavily salted and anyone with a sodium reduction should steer clear. Our server was nice. The atmosphere was great. The décor is great. The food is nothing to brag about. I will not bw back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. The new location is beautiful. The food seems authentic Italian. I would highly recommend going. The bread they bring is awesome. It seems endless too."}
{"text":"\"Meh\"

Wifey and I showed up and waited at the hostess desk for over 5 minutes while she continued to folk napkins even though she saw us standing there. After she finally decided it was time we got some help we were greated with a snarky \"two?\". Um yes obvious as it would seem there are two us. She then goes to tell us with a tone of being bothered  \"we only have the small tables for two in the back, we dont have anything else\".  Way to sell our future dining experience! She was waiting for us to answer if we wanted that table and ill give her credit for this part. It allowed me to use what ive read so much about in leadership books, the ability to quickly make decisions.  

\"No thanks\""}
{"text":"Good place to eat...they do not have soups and the layout is kind of weird because the bar is on the left and very small with tons if seating on the right. The pastas are good but the steak in the pasta was a bit too undercooked. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Had always had good experiences at the Mesa location until the evening of December 14th. Had friends in town and I picked up an order for $111 (not our first time spending that much) and when I got home about two minutes later,  since it's so close, the sauces and some of the pasta  were all over the inside of the bag and all over the containers because they had not been closed securely and properly. When I called the manager and informed him of this (an assistant manager had created this mess) he asked me to bring the food back up. Knowing I had people in town who were waiting on me and knowing I had been there for over an hour waiting to get my food. I informed him I would not be coming back. Not that night or ever again. Had to go to another restaurant to get more food that was packaged correctly and edible. When a restaurant makes it clear that they don't care about correcting messes they make or about making right an unsatisfactory experience it's time to take your money elsewhere. Won't spend another dime here."}
{"text":"This always used to be a neighborhood favorite for my family. I have always loved coming here for the delicious pastas, pizzas and the most delicious bread and olive oil/balsamic. My favorite is the Chicken Chipotle Pasta. I always come in with the mindset that I am going to try something new, but I always fall to my favorite. 

In recent visits however, while the food is still quite good, the service seems to be lacking. The last time we visited, we asked twice for plates and silverware, and ended up having to get it ourselves. Our food was taking unusually long as well and eventually the manager came up nonchalantly saying one of our plates was accidentally dropped, that they were remaking the dish and it would be removed from our bill. Once our food arrived, the supposed \"remade\" dish was cold and tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. 

I will likely return as I do enjoy the food and atmosphere, but hope they get their act together when it comes to the service."}
{"text":"The new location is great!  We were told the wait time was 15 minutes.  Not a problem with  the comfortable outside waiting area.  The stated wait time was spot on.  This time we both ordered the Cajun Jambalaya.  I added shrimp to it.  We split a small brussel sprout and beet salad.  Add their courtesy bread and a couple of glasses of wine.  A wonderful meal!  The service was great, and we had  leftovers for the next day.  So glad to have this new location in the area."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place!  The spicy Alfredo is my very favorite!  Their take out service is super fast. Always piping hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Come here every time we come to Phoenix for spring training. Love the food and the service is great they are very attentive and the price is perfect for a family of four. They always accommodate my kids well which is always a plus. Only thing I wish was that they had crayons or drawing options for the kids, they do get frustrated without that. Had the 16in pizza and their crust is amazing. And their steak and pesto pasta plate was also very well executed. Stake cooked perfectly and my favorite part the Parmesan shavings....yum!"}
{"text":"This place is delish!! Me and my hubby went there a little while ago for dinner we had received a gift card to go, I had been before but that would have been 6 years or so ago and the food than was so so. We went this time and it was great!! I got the manicotti with mushrooms and it was mouthwatering and I had some to take home. The bill wasn't bad either! About 35 for 2 dishes and 2 drinks. We will make sure to come back here soon!"}
{"text":"We love Bob us, a great little Italian restaurant near our home that always delivers."}
{"text":"What a awesome experience and the food was fantastic. We will make sure to make this a stop each time we are in the Valley."}
{"text":"Nice place for fresh Italian. I like the variety of personal pizza. Most of the time I go and eat at the bar and order a glass of wine and the pizza. They bring you fresh hot bread with oil to dip. My favorite is the pear and gorgonzola cheese."}
{"text":"Best food for the money, very consistently great food, I have had around 10 different items off the menu and have liked them all, seriously awesome taste!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy this place for a quick and easy dinner out.  The bread is super good.  Sometimes the entrees are hit and miss... I really enjoy the pizzas and the sandwiches.  My husband loves the spaghetti and meatballs."}
{"text":"I was expecting a fast casual type of place (like an Italian Pei Wei) but actually it is a full service restaurant complete with a separate bar area. They had very swanky, modern decor but still kept it super casual; most of the diners in there on a weeknight were families with kids in shorts and jeans. Everyone from the hostess to the server to the bussers were friendly but brief. Service was pretty much on par with the price point (about the same as Olive Garden).

This place has a very large menu and that is always a turn off for me since I feel that means they don't really have a special focus and so the overall quality of food (ingredients and preparation) will suffer. However, the food was pretty good. Pesto bruschetta was pretty much just cheesy bread so that got me worried that the pasta was also going to be heavy with cheese and cream sauces like so many other chain Italian places So, I opted for the beet and roasted brussel sprout salad. This turned out to be surprisingly good. All the ingredients tasted very fresh (except for the beets, ironically, I believe these were frozen since they lacked flavor) and the dressing was crisp and light. It was a very tasty salad and also very filling since I got the small size for an entree. I did also try my husband's pesto penne and that was pretty good as well. It was a thin sauce, not creamy, which I thought was very good. It did notice, however, that there were strands of spaghetti mixed in with the penne which reinforced my factory assembly line visions of food preparation in places with overly lengthy menus.

Babbo won't replace our favorite Italian places and would not be on my list of destinations for a planned dinner out. But due to the low prices and speedy service it is a good option for a weeknight supper when I just don't want to cook. I noticed they do curbside pickup so that is a big plus, too."}
{"text":"Via Door Dash, I ordered the Roasted Chicken with a side of Pesto Primavera and a Mista salad side.
What recieved was a salty overcooked 2 ounce chicken patty devoid of flavor for $13.95. Boo! The Pesto Primavera was meh, the vegetables were dripping with oil and butter either overcooked or crunchy. 
The Mista salad was delicious with my own ranch dressing. Their ranch did not taste like ranch. 
As for the bread it was stupendous! 
So over all it was NOT worth $13.95 and I will not go back to Babbo. I will not recommend it to my friends and customers. I am throwing away 95% of the meal.
Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Chicken salad, chicken and artichoke calzone, mushroom and asparagus. All extremely good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable Italian eatery. Pasta dishes are large and difficult to finish. Went in on Monday and enjoyed their spaghetti and meatball $6.99 special. Meatballs are huge and marinara sauce is rich and spicy.  A lot of food! My lady enjoyed the spinach and gorgonzola pasta.  Deliciously rich and loaded with cheese, spinach and tomatoes. Will definitely return to devour more selections.
If you arrive around 6pm, be prepared to wait 20-40 minutes."}
{"text":"I really feel like I should go to this place another time or two (and I will!) before reviewing, but I'll go with what I got for now. 

I came here for the $6.99 spaghetti & meatball deal. Babbo does this every Monday & Tuesday all day. It's a HUGE portion and it comes with two LARGE meatballs that are quite good. Honestly, I wasn't a huge fan of the spaghetti sauce. Part of the reason why though is because I just think there was WAY too much of it. Also, I'm picky about red sauce at restaurants in general (which is why I usually don't order dishes with it...I pretty much did it here because of the deal). It was still good enough that I finished the whole bowl though :) Also, the focaccia bread they serve here is fresh and tasty!

The reason I'd like to come back is because they have quite a few specials here I'd like to try. In addition to your usual drink/app HH specials they have a $25 special for two. Each person gets a salad, glass of wine, and a pasta or pizza (and it looks like there's quite a few to choose from). That's a great deal!

I also wish I would have paid more attention to when it was, but they also do a bottle of wine/bruschetta deal like Postino does. However, Babbo's was offered at an earlier hour & more days a week if I remember correctly. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Nice little place to come eat some good Italian food. I wouldn't say it is great but it had some good qualities.  

The Mozza ball appetizer was the best of our dishes. It was on a bed of their homemade bolognese sauce. It was really good.  

Penna Rusticio w/ chicken had a great flavor and the chicken was cooked really well.  The least favorite dish was Creamy Pesto Pasta with steak. It needed both salt and pepper to bring out the flavors of the sauce. After that it was only good, not great. Steak was good but would prefer the chicken on the dish for a better blend of everything. 

We will come back and try pizza and a few other dishes before we say if a keeper or not."}
{"text":"Awful service. If you want to be treated like crap go and ask for the manager Macy. Will never go there again she was so awful"}
{"text":"So we just went to eat here today for a early dinner. We got there at 345ish so it was pretty dead. They had one waiter that was also the bartender for the entire place. The waiter did a good job thats not my complaint. We sat there for almost a hour without our, a older couple walked in 15 min after us and got their food before us! Then the waiter came over with my wife's dish saying they burnt mine and they are remaking it I said OK that's fine I told my wife to start eating, after a few minutes the waiter returns with a calzone I open it up take a bite and it is basically frozen in the middle! That was it the last straw I asked for the manager and told the waiter I don't want the calzone anymore. The manager came over knew what was going on but still didn't come to our table to say anything to us. You would think the price they charge for their food he isn't even professional enough to come to our table? Anyways I was very disappointed in the cooks and the manager our server was awesome but that was about it."}
{"text":"Came here and had one of their lunch specials. For a little over $10 you have your choice of pasta with salad or pizza with salad. I went with the pasta rustica and the spring mix salad subbing balsamic vinaigrette for the sweet vinaigrette it normally came with. 

The salad came out first in a speedy amount of time. The dressing had overall good flavor but was too oily for my tastes. I did enjoy the pine nuts, raisins and red onion combined with the greens, and the feta was a good complement to the other ingredients.

The pasta came next, along with a basket or bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The pasta was al dente, with a balanced amount of marinara sauce, mozzarella cheese, and spinach. The bread was about average but I do appreciate that it was a complimentary offering. 

Service was friendly and sweet. 

I did spy the special for $6.99 spaghetti and meatballs on Mondays and Tuesdays so I will have to go again to try this out!"}
{"text":"Babbo is a very nice restaurant. The setup inside is ideal. There are many booths. They have a bar. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The food is delicious. They have some of the best complimentary bread I've ever had at a restaurant. The portions are pretty large for the price. They have lots of food and pizza options. They usually aren't super busy so you should never have to wait to get in."}
{"text":"Four of us ate at Babbo's this last Thursday.  The service was great. The noise level was okay. We had asked our waiter if we could hold off ordering in order to catch up on old times.. He had no problem with that. When we did order the food did not take long. I was the only one that wasn't overly happy with my meal. I ordered from the chalkboard portion of the menu and had a chicken (cooked fine) with pesto seasoned vegetables on top. The vegetables I felt had been sitting in warming pan and as much as I like pesto this one didn't cut it. Everyone else was very pleased with their selection."}
{"text":"Less than impressed with the customer Service after I had gone for dinner with my friends and we were sitting on the patio and found a roach infestation where their dining area is. 
When we first sat down a little girl at the table next to us noticed a cockroach and said something to the waitress. The waitress told the little girl that she was not right and must've been mistaken. That really bothers me because later in the evening, that same waitress and her manager admitted there was a cockroach problem!! So the staff knew there was a problem yet said the little girl was not right must've been mistaken. So we just let it go only to later find that under our table near the brick wall was a huge cockroach investigation and I saw dozens of them after I signed the flashlight on my phone to see why the wall up like it was moving. After being completely disgusted and we ran inside like total girls to have a manager come up to us and act like we were over reacting when this was right under our table. 
I'll be the first to tell you how amazing their food is however after seeing that and knowing that the waitress blatantly lied about it I'm pretty disgusted. Not to mention that the manager didn't want to even offer to do anything about it and I was not about to ask. 
He informed me that they spray for for the cockroaches every week and that that was enough however I would disagree since they are still there and right where people are eating. If I were you I would highly recommend not sitting on the patio area!"}

{"text":"I have had such a wonderful experience with this location! We recently had Babbo cater our wedding this last weekend and had so many compliments on the delicious food and wonderful service. I always had speedy communication, flexible payment options, and friendly interactions...not to mention how great the food is! I highly recommend this group for any party or occasion!"}
{"text":"really 3.5
About as Middle of the road as you can get. 

I went here after a friend had a negative experience and wanted to see if that was true. 

What I do like is the Food is inexpensive for you get.  It's not expensive as it looks on the outside.   This would be a great place for a date night if the food wasn't so mediocre. 

What I didn't like was the pizza just wasn't well made, (it was like fast food pizza) and the bread was pretty doughy and tasteless.  

I suppose you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Was so anxious to try this restaurant but was disappointed.  Food ok service HORRIBLE.  Probably our server only but management should have been able to see how bad it was as we were next to the hostess station.  Took forever to get our food and I'm not sure what would have happened if I hadn't almost tripped the server - Micah??"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Best spaghetti and meatballs we've ever had...seems a bit pricey except for specials they run for Babbo's Insiders. 
Sorry I had to knock a couple of stars off, the last 3 take home orders have just not been the same. The quality and care that used to be there is fading....can't put my finger on it but the last 3 orders have been incorrect and the ingredients have changed and are just not as good. Lasagna, too much cheese. Spaghetti with meatballs - not as fantastic. Still worth it though, as long as its 6.99.

Update: I ordered another take out order tonight, another big disappointment. You guys were so good for so long, what on earth has happened?!? They said my spaghetti and meatballs would be ready in 15 minutes but I arrived in 10 and immediately checked out. Two minutes later at home, I had to microwave my order. Literally, as though it had been sitting for over an hour, it was cooler than room temp. Ugh, and I even opened my good wine for it. I'm so disappointed at the decline in care/quality over the last year at this location, particularly in take out preparation. Bread was sub-par too; thinly little end piece with no seasonings. It pains me to leave a bad review but this is consistent bad prep on your part. I only hope it helps."}
{"text":"Great food and service. One of my favorite places. Unique pasta... Curried chicken and drunken shrimp! Italian sodas are awesome. Loved the atmosphere and the staff! And the free amazing bread : )"}
{"text":"Food is good and consistent even when you choose take out. I would say the only thing that they lack is good service and I'm being kind. The last time I was in for lunch it was ridiculous how long we waited for our food and our check. Server was nice but something was up either in the back of the house or with new servers or both! Anyway, it's delish Italian pasta and they have so many items to choose from. Great salads and a decent wine menu. Lunch and happy hour specials are great too!"}
{"text":"good pasta! I didn't have a bad experience there. The waiters were friendly, they had good bread and if you get there for happy hour then its a great price too!"}
{"text":"Babbo is a great date place, or lunch or dinner with a friend.  The garlic butter (which you have to ask for) is amaze.  They have a patio outside as well.  I highly recommend.  Every single thing I've tried has been good."}
{"text":"We were excited to see the new location up and running, and brought friends from out of town for dinner on January 1, 2017.  Waited only a few minutes for our table.  We were seated in a half-booth, but the air conditioning there blows directly down on your head (and food), so we asked to move to a table more in the center of the room.  

One of our party ordered a glass of chianti, and they were out.  Another ordered cranberry juice, but they didn't have that either.  Our waiter was clearly new on the job, so we gave him the benefit of the doubt on the very slow delivery of our beverages (approximately 10-15 minutes).  He was not readily available for a good part of our time there, as we were constantly looking for him, but I guess he was in the kitchen.  We had ordered our food at the same time as our beverages, and it was an hour before it arrived.  Our waiter had told us several times that \"your food should be right up,\" but later told us there had been a \"problem in the kitchen.\"  He apologized for the delay, and said he would have the manager come by to speak with us.  That NEVER happened.  We saw numerous other guests waiting a very long time as well for their food.

The 2 pasta dishes and the salads were delicious, but the calzone was burnt on top.

We'll most likely wait a few more weeks before trying again.  Hoping they can get it together, because we have always liked their food."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant, they  have excellent food. We love the atmosphere and friendly staff. Great selection for the kids. Best stuffed churros by far."}
{"text":"This is a cozy little place, set up in a perfect spot for a restaurant, for it is surrounded by a few fast food joints. No one wants fast food all the time, so this nice little addition to this busy complex in this area, it is perfect! This is not a huge restaurant; it's more of a smaller, cozy, relaxing kind of place. I never go here during the dinner or lunch rush, for it can get quite busy, coming here later in the evening is usually better. I enjoyed their chicken alfredo with a nice glass of Moscato while a friend of mine enjoyed one of their cold sandwiches. The food came out pretty quick and the service was really good. The food was decent, not the best but not the worst, I think the alfredo could have had a little more flavor to the sauce, but it wasn't bad. It's a different place to eat and if im in the area im sure ill go back."}
{"text":"Get In My Mouth Babbo! 
Best Italian place in Surprise. Their Spicy Sausage Alfredo is to die for, seriously, thank you Jesus for dying for this sinful food.
The bread and olive oil they serve while waiting is also amazing. I've eaten in and done take out, both great experiences. 
Try this place, it will not disappoint. Just don't go on the nights they sell the Spaghetti and Meatball plate for $5.99.. too many people, PACKED. Those are just take out nights ;)"}
{"text":"Great food, lovely décor, spot on wait staff.  Awesome date night!! We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Okay, where do I start!  I am so very happy that we found this place!  We had a fabulous dining experience.  The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and laid out well.  It's spacious, which makes for a comfortable environment.  We were greeted immediately upon entering and felt welcomed throughout our stay.  Now...the food.  Oh my...the food!  It is soooo good!  Everyone in our party of 5 enjoyed their meal and our server was awesome!  So, great service, comfortable environment and awesome food!  Sold!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences at this Babbo. I went with a group of friends who got a variety of dishes, including salads, pizzas, and pastas, and everyone enjoyed their food. I went a couple weeks later and this time tried their Pasta Martini, and it was absolutely AWFUL. The sauce was watery and bland and the chicken tasted like boiled or microwaved Tyson's strips- gross! I will certainly never try this dish again. However, because of the other positive experiences I've had (the wait staff has always been excellent and the rest of the food tasty), I will likely return."}
{"text":"What a great menu! I stopped in for a take out lunch at 11:30 and the waitress/hostess was fantastic! I am a vegetarian and lactose intolerant so eating creamy or buttery sauces is out of the question. The waitress offered to sub the marinara sauce on the pasta primavera so that's what I ordered, for over $10.00. (a bit pricey for a vegetarian dish I thought)

While I was waiting I scoped out the full bar and inquired about Happy Hour specials. I was very disappointed to learn that there is NO wine on special for happy hour. (except for sangria) At an Italian place? REALLY????  This is why the 4 star review. UMMM... Hello Owners? Might want to change that if you want our happy hour business.The  $5.00 apps looked great and were priced well. They also do a couples \"lunch special\" for $25.00 for happy hour which does include ONE glass of wine.

The actual lunch specials were great bit expensive to me for just lunch at $9.00. A small pasta with salad or a small pizza with salad. 

The restaurant itself was really done beautifully and probably even wound qualify for romantic at night if the lighting is nice and it isn't too loud.

I got my pasta home and was pleasantly surprised that included was some yummy warm foccicia bread with an olive oil, balsamic vinegar with spices dip! Thanks!

Oh, the pasta was wonderful and the portion was large enough so I have dinner tonight too! :)"}
{"text":"Great food and service. We went for the spaghetti and meatball special on Monday night. I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Four companions in my party for a thank you diner last week. The food left a lot to be desired. One pizza and three pasta dishes. Mine was suppose to be creamy it was more like the consistency of 1/2 and 1/2. The cheese pizza lacked any flavor and salads overdressed. Our server was cordial. Frankly the bread with Balsamic/Olive oil was the highlight. What has happened to this place ? Guess I'll spend my money else where."}
{"text":"Came here one evening for dinner to try out their spaghetti & meatballs special. I liked the look of the restaurant - pretty modern for an Italian restaurant. We started off with toasted ravioli which I really liked. The foccaccia that they bring out is also really good. I mulled over the menu for a bit and considered getting something else but I thought - when in Rome. So I got the spaghetti & meatballs and it was nothing better than what I could have made at home. Now, if they used the same marinara they used with the toasted ravioli for the spaghetti, they would have been on point. I'm not sure if that one dish is reflective of their entire menu, but I don't know how soon I'll be coming back to try them out."}
{"text":"We really liked this place. The atmosphere was good, drinks and food were awesome and fairly priced. The only reason it got 3 stars is the table service. Had great service at the hostess stand and bar while waiting for our table and the bartenders really talked up the food and discussed the menu and recommended things to us. However, once seated things changed. Didn't get plates for the bread so we were dropping the oil and balsamic all over the table. He didn't bring or ask if we wanted water and did not even ask if we wanted an appetizer or to add a salad. Did not ask if we wanted another drink either. We had to motion him over to get water. Could have sold another two drinks, appetizer and salads probably $40 more on our bill. However, great menu very unique and really  good food. Fairly priced. We will go back again. Opening one near Westgate next year."}
{"text":"An unfortunate disappointing evening... This restaurant has an opportunity to excel in an area where fine dining is very limited. The restaurant is attractive, always crowded. We usually sit at the bar and get incredible service. We sat at a table with some friends and the experience was disappointing from the get go. It took a while for our waitress to acknowledge us, even longer to actually get our drinks, the waitresses bus support was less than helpful when we asked for a second salad. I was astonished he actually said \"I can't do that\". Finally, when we were done with our meal, we sat and stared at dirty plates for at least 20 minutes until we got our bill. 
The food is excellent and the only reason I gave this 3 stars."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Cave Creek location and my experience there was great. As a result, I tried the 16th St. location today with a guest (despite the mixed reviews). My experience here was also excellent. My waiter, name Noel was friendly and there was no wait. I would go here again, and I plan on it."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, and haven't been disappointed at all!   

Servers have always been friendly; this past time there, the GM (I'm assuming) came by when we were done and took our plates.it was actually a busy Friday lunch crowd, so nice to see their attentiveness to their guests as well those waiting for a table.

I am in love with their Brussels Sprouts and Pancetta Pasta Dish, it has some spice in it as well, but it's basically brussels, pancetta, pasta in olive oil and Parmesan..yummy..

The bread served is yummy, I think it's better than Olive Garden's! And it's served with olive oil and balsamic , great way to start the meal. 

They do have an happy hour special, that's next, but it's not over priced for a good plate of pasta, salads, or pizzas..so enjoy!!"}
{"text":"The only thing I didn't love about this place was the wait but totally worth it for the food in my opinion. The bread is amazing and my son loves their Italian sodas. They have a lot of opinions as far as food goes and a good wine list."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant twice unfortunately was disappointed both times. To me for the price of the food for the portion size you get is ridiculous.  Since you don't get a salad with your expensive meal, I ordered one, figuring I'd split it with my friend.  I mean after all for $5 bucks for a side salad this thing should be huge!  NOT!!!!!!!  IT WAS lettuce on a tiny saucer sized salad plate. I almost sent it back,  I did have to complain to the server.  That was ridiculous! 
Being Italian myself,  I find this Babbo's Restaurant insulting to Italian people,  seriously!  First of all Italian food is not expensive to make and secondly Have you ever been to a true Italians house for dinner?  There is NOTHING skimpy about it,  they feed you!!!!!!
Step it up Babbo's you have a heritage to uphold and a dedicated market of neighbors who were excited about your Restaurant coming to the area.. Please don't disappoint Our patronage. 
The atmosphere is nice.  But I'm sorry the food is just average and the lack of serving a salad in the price of the expensive meal is greedy.
Thank you in advance for seeking true Customer satisfaction, your neighbors/Patrons will appreciate it!   I will try it one more time in the near future with high hopes of seeing somewhat of a change for the better. 
Thanks again for responding to my sincere and honest review.  What can I say, THAT'S ITALIAN!!! :)"}
{"text":"This place IS open on Sundays unlike what the Yelp hours say! Shame on Yelp for not letting you edit business Info from the Yelp iPad app. Lame."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm raising my rating back up. Babbo sent us a gift card to come back after our terrible experience with out last take out order. So last night we finally decided to use the gift card and give them another try. 

We got our food to go and it was great! I had the spring mix salad with mozzarella instead of feta, and the classic spaghetti and meatballs, and my BF got a Cesar salad and with his Italian pasta. They also gave us two squares of bread with oil and vinegar.

The spring mix salad was fantastic! I could have had a huge bowl of that and I'm not usually a big fan of salads. My spaghetti was also really really good. It came super hot with two giant meatballs, the pasta was cooked well and it had a really good amount of sauce which I like; I hate dry pastas. The only small complaint I had is about the sautéed mushrooms I added to my pasta. I was expecting thick slices of large mushrooms, but instead they were these tiny pieces; no bigger or thicker than my pinky nail. So it didn't seem worth it to pay extra for sautéed mushrooms. My boyfriend made no complaints about his meal and also really enjoyed it.

All in all the meal was wonderful and we'll definitely be going back now."}
{"text":"Just went here for our anniversary and it was so yummy. The bread was amazing and fresh and our meals were huge and filling. I had the chicken Alfredo which was very good and my husband had a calzone and he couldn't even finish it! Great little neighborhood restaurant to go out for a nice occasion!"}
{"text":"Seriously need new wait staff and front of house management.    Long wait times, disorganized, managers loitering around not helping to clear guests.  The order taker even said ...oh. I am sorry sir...the closest thing we have to lasagne is the spaghetti with meat sauce???  What?   Where do they train these people.   Very sad.....the place has good food but. Needs to retrain or get rid of the current staff.. ..."}
{"text":"First time here the other night. The food was really good. We both had a pasta dish and the flavors were great. The bread you get before the meal is delicious.  Not really feeling much of an Italian vibe from the restaurant but the food makes up for it. If you want good fresh Italian food at a reasonable price this is the place to go. There is no need to ever go to a chain Italian restaurant when you can go here. They also have good happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"I had never eaten at Babbo before and was craving Italian food so I placed an order online for pick up. There is a separate entrance for take out orders and well as some parking spots for take out which made it convenient. 

My order was still being prepared when I arrived but the waitress waited by the open kitchen for it which I appreciated. 

I wasn't sure how my food would taste based on the way it looked but I pleasantly surprised with my entree: garlic shrimp pasta which consisted of shrimp, creamy garlic sauce, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes with linguine. I rarely eat an entire meal and usually have about half leftover for the next day however, my meal was so delicious that I ate all of it. It looked like a dog licked the plate by the time I was done. That's how amazing my food was. 

They provided their freshly baked bread with it as well which was great to dip into the sauce. I also had a side Cesar salad which was small but tasty. I loved everything about my meal and the fact it tasted so good with a take out order says a lot. See my photos for portion sizes. 

Will definitely be eating at Babbo Italian again. Loved my meal and the service was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Best bread ever! I've never had a disappointing meal here. I did notice prices went up, but everything is good and make sure you go for specials or HH. This new location was on the ball and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place . I went to a wedding show with a friend because she is getting married and they were  there to show off the catering. When we tried samples the pasta was delicious! It was so good that my friend and I decided to eat here for lunch one day. When we went in the place it was half empty. We were surprised because of the reviews and it was a Saturday that the place would be empty. We got sat, we ordered our drinks, and looked at the menu. Our waiter was very nice and brought our drinks out quickly. We ordered our food once we got our drinks. I got the garlic chicken pasta and my friend got a garlic zucchini pasta. When our waiter brought out the bread with the dipping oil..we were disappointed because the the bread was still doughy and it was slimy and chewy. When we got our pasta we were disappointed as well the pasta was pretty much like soup. At one point my friend Said the sauce would make a better mushroom soup. I thought the same. It was very soupy. You would think it would be creamy?  I guess we came on a bad day or something because the reviews are great but sadly I can't say we have a great experience. I would have to say maybe we will try again but this being our first time was very disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been going to Babbo's for years. Only eaten in resturant a number if times. We always do take out. Yesterday we decided to go for dinner. The service was beyond slow and bad. The resturant was pretty empty for a Sunday evening. We waited over 40 minutes for our food after placing order. About  20 minutes into our wait we were told our order got made incorrectly and it would be out quickly. This was not the case. My son's food came out 15 minutes prior to ours. He had the Alfred Penne, had no flavor at all what so ever. I ordered the Pasta Puglia, which looked more like a bowl of zoodle soup.  As for service the waitress never came by to check on us before after order was placed, or after food arrived. I asked for napkins and never recieved any. I noticed other group of people arrive after we did and had their food out before us. The quality of service and food left a lot to be desired. My suggestions order to go."}
{"text":"To be honest, when H and I got home from our first (and only) dinner here, there was not ONE good thing we could say about it.

To start, when the server came over to take drink orders, she looked at me, and I asked for just tap water.  Off she went.  H wanted a beer, but not only was he not asked for a drink order, she didn't even look at him.  Weird.

We got our waters, and then H ordered a beer.  Off she went.

H's water glass had lipstick smudges on it.  Simply gross.  I know they are hard to get off plastic, particularly, but can someone check this in advance?  The manager came by at one point, asked how things were, and we mentioned the glass, and off she went to replace it.  No major apology there, and she didn't seem like this was that unusual.

Anyway, we ordered an appetizer, pasta for me, and a calzone for him.  Then, we waited.  A VERY long time.

Finally, the appetizer arrived, and less than 45 seconds later, the entrees arrived.  Not sure if the kitchen didn't make the app, it wasn't ordered, or what, but the sequence of service was horrible.

Our server came by to check on things, and we mentioned the app situation, and she said she could take our entrees back to the kitchen and put them under the heat lamp until we were done with the appetizer.  Seriously?

To the food...to call it bland and tasteless would be a compliment.  The pasta was overcooked, and the sauce was entirely lacking in flavor.  It reminded me of Chef Boyardee from the can.  A super treat when you're 4, not 40.  His calzone - same.  It was big and puffy, but not tasty, and with the same bland red sauce - phoey.

The entire experience was horrible - from the marginal service, to the dirty serveware, and the lousy food.

Oh, wait - I just thought of the one redeeming thing from the visit.  Now we know NOT to go back."}
{"text":"Feels like a traditional Italian restaurant. Greet decor and wonderful feel inside. Service was good but server was new and seemed a little nervous and it was understandable since we were a party of 10. Food was great. I had stuffed Manicotti and would get it again!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating at Babbo's until recently.  I have been eating there with my family for about 4 years now.  Great food and wonderful service.  But over the past year some of there dishes have changed.  It's almost like the restuarant has changed the vendor who they purchase their food from.  The first thing I notice was their delicious bread was different.  The bread they served before was to die for.  The bread they have changed to very lack luster.  It taste bread that you can get an any number of restuarants.

I always noticed the beef in their Firecracker Rolls and on the Steak and Blue salad are different.  Both of those were my favorites to order but not anymore.  The last time I had those meals I was pregnant so when I did not enjoy the taste I thought had to do with my hormones or something.  I had my baby in March and I tried those meals just last weekend and I steal do not like the taste.  

Please Babbo's go back to you previous food vendor.  My mom and brother have also made comments about the meals not tasting the same.  I need your original bread in my life...lol."}
{"text":"This establishment would be an EASY 5 star review if it were based solely on food and drink selection and quality. 

Unfortunately it is rare occurrence to have a positive interaction with the service, and their bar is overpriced. 

We return often because the food is great, but almost exclusively order take out/to-go now because we don't enjoy the in-dining service experience AT ALL."}
{"text":"Babbo was one of my favorite Italian restaurants when I lived in Surprise. I miss it since Las Vegas has a terrible selection of Italian restaurants. The Italian sodas, appetizer bread, and the Sicilian Ragu pasta were all favorites of mine."}
{"text":"This place was a breath of fresh air.My wife had the pancetta and brussels sprouts pasta and I had the chicken chipotle pasta. Both were deliciously prepared. The range of Italian dishes on the menu was was absolutely wonderful from pizza to pastas to sandwiches. We will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time on Super Bowl Sunday. Expecting it to be crowded, we were pleasantly surprised that there were only 8-10 people in the whole restaurant. We were seated immediately and our server brought water and warm bread with plain olive oil and a splash of balsamic vinegar. No spices, just oil and vinegar. The bread was tasty, but the vinegar overpowered the plain olive oil. We ordered and the food came out relatively fast. I had the Chicken Marsala with fresh seasonal vegetables. The chicken was way overcooked and the vegetables were actually burnt, black and crispy. There was no marsala sauce and everything was over salted. My wife had the flank steak salad, which is described as med-med well doneness on the menu. It was very well done also. She described the dressing as watery and fairly tasteless. I was so disappointed in the food after watching this place go up over the last months. I was hoping for something hip and casual in the Italian market to add to our minimal choices this far out in the E Valley......sadly that is not the case. The building is a modern design and they have a wonderful patio. I hop that they can hire a better cook, because if they don't, I'm afraid they will not be around very long. And $10 Italian margaritas?? Come on!"}
{"text":"12 of us for lunch today it was the 70th birthday party we had people from age 86 to Age 4 at the party the waitress was phenomenal however the food was disgusting I had a mista salad which I have all the time there was so much vinegar on it that I could scoop it up with a spoon at the bottom of the bowl if I choose to do so.  I also had the pasta roostica which I always have the sauce had absolutely no flavor and it was runny with water.
They took off my bill but not the point.
We almost feel like if we don't go on Monday or Tuesday for the spaghetti and meatballs we don't get a good meal anymore"}
{"text":"It's convenient and straight forward menu. A good place for a large party with variety of options. Reservation for party of six or larger (a plus). Good value for pocket spending. I've always had good experience here, just a little commercialized-feeling when I dined here. Staff are always nice and attentive. Breads is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"We went in here Tuesday, everything was great we both had the special, spaghetti and 2 huge meatballs and a side salad mista.... salad was very fresh and meatballs were tasty. We haven't eaten here in years because food was bad last time, but I was hungry and didn't want to drive too far, so we are glad we came back and will try again soon!"}
{"text":"ate here in 2008 I'm sure it's changed but the food was great and good for meeting.
they where very accommodating for a large party. 

was a little expensive for az."}
{"text":"Fodd was ok. We went to try the special, monday and tuesday all day, spaghetti and meatballs for6.99. You also get the house bread with that. Looking at the menu, the prices were okay for an upscale eatery. Lunch specials were about $10.00. Was seated quickly, waiter was prompt, friendly and our food came quickly.. Might return, im just not really an upscale type of person.. Was clean and quiet, AC was on so it was nice to sit and relax a bit.."}
{"text":"For 13.75 you get 95% buttery pasta and 5% meat. I pulled 5 pieces of shrimp out of my order. Babbo is only really worth going to on Mondays and Tuesdays during the spaghetti and meatball special."}
{"text":"The best,  like,  place to eat,  spend time and a great pave just to kick back and let the day be coming to an an end; for the food,  cs and look are great....I think that they even care so much that they have a clean, bathroom. Simply,  this place is top of the line..thank you for being a great pace to spend time with the people I enjoy in a place that us enjoyable."}
{"text":"First time here. I always wondered how this place was since I pass it on a daily basis, it does always seem packed for dinner time. Decided to give it try tonight with my family. 

At first I thought it was an Italian \"fast\" restaurant similar to sauce (which I love by the way). Its actually more of a sit down and order restaurant. Their deco kind of throws you off a little bit. We got seated pretty fast for how busy it was. 

They serve you focaccia bread with oil and vinegar as a starter. However I wasn't a huge fan of the focaccia (thank goodness I would have totally ate the entire thing!) we started with an appetizer the mozza-balls, which were delicious! I want to say they were most definitely stuffed with mozzarella and I think Parmesan, Sitting on top of their delicious meat sauce. I loved how they weren't super greasy they were really crunchy and fried to perfection! 

I ordered the pasta primavera which was delicious! My husband and son ordered the macncheese and spaghetti I had a taste of both of course! And I was envious of their dishes lol. 

Our server which I believe his name was Brandon (don't quote me) he was really nice, enthusiastic, and helpful. Very attentive as well. Their menu can get a little overwhelming for me at least. I'm such an indecisive person it ruins my life! Haha
 

All in all a great place for some yummy pasta. Next time I will try their pizza and cocktails. I was taking a look at their cocktail menu and a few drinks caught my eye and tastebuds! Definite must try if you're in the area. Order the mozza-balls please! You can thank me later."}
{"text":"This place is close to my parents house in Cave Creek and whenever I'd drive by the joint looked deserted; like and Iraqi restaurant or something... Big misnomer. I went a few weeks ago and all I can say is WOW. Fresh, tasty and reasonably priced. EVERYTHING tasted fresh and was cooked to order. The margarita pizza combined with spicy Italian sausage comes off a bit salty, but hey, that's how I roll. I highly recommend them! (yes I edited this review. I didn't like my first one)"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, excellent service from Cameron. He knows what he's doing. We had the Couples Combo, 2 individual pizzas, 2 salads and two glasses of wine (hubby substituted a wine for a beer) for $25. Will definitely go back. Large pasta selection I want to try!"}
{"text":"My initial take on Babbo after walking inside is that the food was going to be as average as the decor looked. But I was surprised. For such an extensive menu, the quality of the meals was very good.

Complimentary warm focaccia bread with oil and balsamic was a wonderful start but we still ordered two apps:

Wild Mushrooms with Roasted Asparagus (9.95) - Wild Mushrooms, Marsala, Toasted Walnuts, Roasted Asparagus, Shaved Parmesan 

Spicy Green Beans - Fire Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Sautéed Spicy Green Beans, Almonds, Shaved Parmesan

If I could only choose one app, I suggest the spicy green beans because there is more flavor and less oily. The spice tickled my tongue, there was no burn. Only flavor.

For entrees we enjoyed a regular order of Penne Marinara and 

Pasta Primavera (11.95) - Mixed Peppers, Broccoli, Zucchini, Mushrooms, Diced and Sun Dried Tomatoes in a White Wine Garlic Butter Sauce. Served on Linguine. 

There was ample sauce in both dishes and I mixed a bit with the other. Tasty! 

After having the spicy appetizer I wanted some spicy in my primavera so I had to add some pepper. On the next visit I'm going to ask if the chef will make the dish spicy too.

Tiramisu for dessert.
Not a fan. Won't order again.

 ."}
{"text":"I first tried out Babbo's at their Surprise location while visiting some friends several years ago. Since then, I've been a regular customer at this location because it's a lot closer to my work.

They have a really nice selection of food to choose from... so many options that sometimes it's difficult to pick one. What is clear is that there is something here for everyone, from salads to pasta to pizza - they have you covered!

If you are into salds, look no further. My faves are the Mista and the Steak 'n Blue. I've yet to try the Steak and Tequila Lime, but it's on my bucket list for the next visit. 16 salads in all with a lot of healthy options here. 

On the pasta side, there are countless options. Personally, I like the Pasta Valducci, Drunken Shrimp Pasta, Spicy Alfredo Pasta and good 'ole Spaghetti & Meatballs. 

In the pizza department, they offer both personal size pizzas, as well as 12\" Neapolitan Style Pizzas in both thin and crispy crust. At lunch I usually go for the lunch special - one of their personal pizzas and a Mista salad. For me, the Margherita and Sicilian pizzas rule!

If salad, pasta or pizza are not your thing, they also offer sandwiches and calzones. They also serve italian sodas and have dessert available.

Contrary to what some reviewers noted, I have never had any service problems with this location. At least at lunch time, our service has always been excellent and the servers very attentive. Definitely worth a visit if you haven't been here yet!"}
{"text":"I don't typically like chains, in fact I avoid them, but a co-worker raved about a Babbo salad. The roasted beet & brussel sprout salad with goat cheese is outstanding. My husband and I split the salad, next time we will each get our own. I ordered a pasta dish with a shrimp which was also good. They give you an ample amount of shrimp which is not the norm for most restaurants. 

The 5 stars is for the salad. Overall, I would give Babbo 3 stars."}
{"text":"Normally wouldn't give that many stars to a chain type place but I am blown away by their customer service and attention to detail.  I emailed to ask about their gluten free cooking practices and they answered back quickly and with great information!  I feel safe eating here based on what I've been told and have seen.  As of this writing, all of their sauces are gluten free.  Their chicken is marinated in a soy based sauce that may or may NOT be gf so be forwarned!  They cook their gf pasta in it's own water as opposed to plopping it into used regular pasta water (which means it's no longer gf and is a way some restaurants which serve gf pasta do it, so be careful and ASK!)

The pasta and the sauce was fresh and flavorful.  The bread smelled divine and I was totally bummed that I couldn't have any!  The service was good and our food came out fast!  I will be tripping around this menu for sure!  Awesomesauce!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and most likely the last. Arrived at 4:15pm dining room was dead and yet waited to be greeted and seated. Again waited to be greeted at the table when we finally were greeted we went ahead and ordered. 2 adult meals and 2 kids meals no appetizers. Again waited......then ordered a dessert......waited again... dessert arrived burnt. We returned it and asked for bill. After all was said and done we finally left at 6:20pm and we missed church. The food was ok nothing special."}
{"text":"Just went to the recently opened new location in Surprise. Very disappointing.
Pizza not cooked in the middle, service was horrible and since this is my 3rd try at Babbo in Surprise, I guess I will not be going back.  I hoped that the new location would have them up the game against the competition (Oregano\"s) but unfortunately the service is worse than before and the food quality is very poor."}
{"text":"Babbo Italian Eatery is a notch above casual dining.  Is that trendy on the rating scale?  At the beginning of the meal, we received some bread pieces with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping.  If I recall, some shredded cheese was also involved.  We've always been pleased with what was ordered.  I usually have a pasta.  My daughter usually gets a pizza.  And my wife orders something vegetarian.  There is a location near my house, and we visited this location on the way back from Wickenburg.    The service is good and the prices are commensurate with a trendy restaurant."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised when I walked in. I guess I wasn't expecting a nice sit down restaurant. It exceeded my expectations in that regard. The server was great. Very attentive. The Palermo pizza was amazing. Buttery great crust, lots of cheese. The Sicilian pizza was very over cooked. The crust was harder and the toppings were chewy and hard. I would get the first pizza again and will be back to try more stuff. Great restaurant."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time trying Babbo and I'm sad to say i wasn't impressed. 

PROS:  easy to go parking, friendly staff,  nice interior, and decent bread.

CONS:  They need to improve their online ordering process. The reason I picked Babbo was it was close and they did online ordering. I placed my order and got the Confirmation email saying average to go time is 20 min.  I show up 20 min later and when I got to the counter the gal (who was very nice) told me my order was not in their system yet.  She proceeded to say the company they use for online orders FAXES the the orders to them and then the team turns around and types the order into their computer.  So my order had been sitting on their fax machine until I showed up.  The gal thanked me for being patient and typed in my order so the kitchen would start making it.  Hmmmm. What good is having online ordering if you are still relying on faxes and hand keying orders in??  Talk about a gap in their process.   Sadly I had to wait another 15-20 min....which had I have known that I would have shopped longer in the area. When I eventually got my food it was just meh.  I thought the calzone was just ok.  While the ingredients seemed pretty solid, the dough was super thin.  I also got fettuccini Alfredo and it was just ok as well.  The noodles tasted a little stale (like they were sitting under a heat lamp for a bit) and the sauce was a bit bland.  

I'll try most places twice...So I hope the 2nd time is better."}
{"text":"We went there at 6 o clock on friday, with no reservations, the place was packed. We wanted to sit outside, but the girls said it will take an hour for a seat there... so we decided to sit inside instead, we got a seat at around 6:30...

Great service, great food. I ordered Pasta Valducci and my husband ordered Caprese pizza, which was just amazing... i kept taking bites from his plate... i just loved my pasta which was such a fresh change for my tastebuds. I ordered a pinot grigo, we also had a salad, minta i guess which was just great... we really filled our selves with the bread, which was such a great change from the greasy shit that Olive garden serves...

We just ate half of our food and packed rest, I know Portion control is important that is why...

Anyways we will definitely go back there..."}
{"text":"I really dislike this location! This was the second time I came here and the second time I hated it. The one on 16st is so much better! 

Anyway, we came here early in the day when it wasnt too busy so the service was good. The bread wasnt very good or fresh. I got my usual which is the fresh tomato mozzerella which is amazing at the other location. And my bf got the creamy asparagus or something like that and they came out immediately. Now, I like fast service but too fast service means the food is old. Anyway, everything was all well and then the aftermath was awful. I ended with a headache and stomachache, overall really sick. 

Do yourself a favor and go to a different location, this location has the worst rating out of the rest, so that should tell you something."}
{"text":"the first time i went to babbos was the one on 67th and the 101, and my experience was ok, not the best. But tonight, we went to the one on 16th street and it was absolutely OUTSTANDING!!! There were sooooo many choices of pasta that it became difficult to choose! You're gonna want to try them ALL. Anyway, the pastas we got were incredible, but im sure they are all delicious! and that bread and oil and vinegar they bring out is AMAZING. that was my favorite. Overall, food was wonderful.

Service, you ask. THE BEST! our waitress, Jessica was amazing. She was a delight! She was on point, checking up on us frequently, keeping up with refills, and even getting personal with us. She is SO sweet. We LOVED her. She definitely made our experience better. So if the manager is reading this, GIVE HER A RAISE!!! ;) we will defintely be requesting her. 

Want italian and great service? This location babbos is your spot!"}
{"text":"This review is specifically for the bartender Danielle on a Wednesday night. 5 star bartender! She went above and beyond to make my first trip here wonderful. She was personable, attentive and made every customer smile.

Now for the restaurant...the food was ok. I got their kale salad but it didn't hit the spot like I hoped it would. Their brussel sprouts were bomb.com tho!! Yummo. Everyone at the bar raved about their food so I'll definitely be back to explore the menu. 3.75 stars for food based on this solo experience. 

As for booze, I got their red blend wine and it was delish. Highly recommend it! This place is definitely worth checking out. (I was surprised at the number of upper-aged folks for what that's worth.)"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It is new to my neighborhood and I was glad when it opened. I have been to a few of their other locations and really like the food. I have not had a bad meal  there , the food has always been consistent. It comes out hot and delicious."}
{"text":"I came in again after a few months of being away and was delighted to see that my favorite server Zebulon was behind the bar now! He did a wonderful job, moving from bar tending and take out orders and even a few tables. He really does it all!! And we of course had the same excellent service and in our option an award winning smile from Zebulon the entire time. He truly makes this place worth coming back to! Great food and great atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Was hoping for more. It was noisy and the food was no better than fast food, but with a much higher price tag. The staff were very attentive and nice so all was not lost. The bread was nice. Overall, we like food too much to be happy with the quality of the pasta we were served."}
{"text":"My wife and I absolutely love the food and the service is always great. The firecracker rolls are a must."}
{"text":"Cozy comfortable quaintly lite a nice ambiance. Greated and sat emediatly, clean plush setting. Food served hot and generous portions. Very tasty meat balls to die for. Great service checked on frequently asked if anything need or hows it going moderstly price.      Server. jesse. Awesome."}
{"text":"Came here for take out tonight. The service was extremely friendly and the food was delicious! If I'm ever back in the Phoenix area I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Do not go yet. Moved to new bigger location but did not hire servers. Empty tables and empty booths but cannot seat you because they do not have servers so an hour wait. Think about ordering to go, think again that is a 30 minute wait."}
{"text":"I had high hopes since there were such good reviews on here, plus it was highly recommended by a few co-workers of mine. I was really disappointed...not only with the food, but with the service as well. It started with the way we were greeted...or shall I say, not greeted! There wasn't a hostess and multiple people saw us standing there waiting, but yet no one came over to seat us. Finally a guy came up and said \"have you been helped?\" Nope, hence why I'm still standing here waiting. He wasn't welcoming at all. Not much expression on his face and didn't really say much as he brought us to our table. He ended up being our server. He took our order and after telling him it was my first time eating there, he wasn't much help with the menu. They bring out complimentary bread, but our server forgot to bring us any until after our food was brought out. I could see if they were really busy, but it was after the lunch rush on a weekday and he brought the table next to us bread and they were seated after us! I ordered the Chicken Alfredo with veggies. It was honestly comparable to a frozen meal from the grocery store, even the chicken. My son ordered off the kids menu, Penne Alfredo, in which we added chicken. Then came the bill. I knew mine was $12.50, but my sons ended up costing about the same! $4.95 to add chicken to a kids meal that costs $5.00?!?! Maybe he should have said something! So we paid $30 for crappy food and crappy service. I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Owner/Upper Manager Horribly Inappropriate. Please rethink dining at any of the Babbo Italian Eatery restaurants. I visited the Scottsdale location yesterday during lunch. I decided to sit in the bar area since I was alone. After a few minutes, a man sits 3 seats down from me. He was talking on his phone loudly enough that I could hear every word clearly. He was angrily and emotionally berating the person (obviously an employee or previous employee) on the other end- using disparaging language and insensitive, unkind remarks. After 15 minutes, I became so uncomfortable listening to this conversation that I moved to a different table. My server was very apologetic. In addition, the floor manager came by and asked me how my meal was. I told him the man at the bar was having a very contentious, loud conversation that caused me to move. He sheepishly apologized and quickly left. The man on the phone noticed me changing tables but did not apologize or end his conversation. I watched the man interact with numerous staff members and guessed he was high up in the restaurant. An employee there confirmed this. My server was fabulous. The food is mediocre at best. I CAN NOT and WILL NOT spend my money at an establishment headed by a rude, insensitive, inappropriate person. You do not have these sensitive conversations in front of others, especially customers and other employees. In addition, I don't care what the circumstances were/are, you never need to speak to someone in a malicious, condescending, hateful manner."}
{"text":"We were in town for a week and ate here twice. The first time, the food was just OK but decided to give it another shot for their pizza. They messed up the pizza toppings and when you're hungry, having to wait 15 minutes for them to fix it seems like an eternity. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Italian food, this isn't your place.

If, however, you're looking for an alternative to the other well-known American/Italian eatery, give this place a shot.  It's a bit more \"snazzy\" and the food is good quality. Prices are in line with similar establishments."}
{"text":"I have been in twice since the restaurant opened and was very pleased on each visit.  Nice, comfortable décor and very friendly staff.  Menu is quite broad, with lots of choices.  First visit i had a chicken protein bowl and my friend had spaghetti - we each liked our entrees and the warm bread is also very good.  On my second visit I had a Tuscan Turkey Italian sandwich and it was pretty good but didn't knock my socks off."}
{"text":"Pleasant staff, very accommodating! Food is delicious and the bread is the best bread in the area hands down."}
{"text":"I recommend the 3 cheese Mac N Cheese; a little spicy, but delicious!

Price has increased over years and noticed the restaurant has become stingy on bread portions.  

If you're looking to sit at the bar for an alcohol beverage, look else where. It's a more family diner environment and they only have about 6-8 bar seats."}
{"text":"Recently discovered this local restaurant. When I find something that I really like I stick with it. Their special spaghetti with 2 large meatballs Mon and Tues is that something. You can't beat it. 
The first time I planned to try it I though it was just pretty mediocre but was quite surprised.  The sauce is cooked just right and not raw tasting like one other chain Italian restaurant.  I think the last name of that one is \"Garden\".  It is a good source of Vitamin C. The pasta is just cooked right and their recipe for their meatballs is one of the best. So when I am feeling like I need a little extra Vitamin C I head right to Babbo. Other times also when I start craving some good Italian food. This is real East Coast Italian cooking which is hard to find in AZ. Not many SW restaurants know how to cook Italian. 
Almost forgot the home made bread they serve there.  Crusty just like it is suppose to be. Try some of their Olive oil and balsamic mix for dipping."}
{"text":"Very yummy food.  I love meatballs and pasta with fresh baked warm bread yum. Put a Caesar salad and passion ice tea and you are pat your stomach happy."}
{"text":"I really like the food here. Wish the restaurant had more seating though. Prices are good and so are the portions. Love the fetuccini Alfredo and the lasagna was good as well. Pretty good wine selection too. Definitely worth a try of you haven't already."}
{"text":"We eat here quite often - I love the specials - it isn't typical Italian restaurant.  It is small and cozy, the food is very good and REASONABLE! They have a full bar and the service is quite good.  It gives you the impression of a strip mall typical restaurant, but it isn't.  It is very good."}
{"text":"Love the Monday night special of $5.99 all you can eat Spaghetti and Meat balls! 
Very tasty! 

We were able to get a seat pretty quickly. Drinks came fast. Food was good!
I think they cater too. 

if you are looking for some simple Italian past and a glass of wine, Babbo is great!"}
{"text":"I went here the day it opened and thought it might be just another Italian place..and now every time I go I check in on FourSquare! It's totally addictive..the restaurant...I love their inexpensive Monday-Tuesday Spaghetti & Meatballs. Their onion bread with basil is really great..they even have a little bar. I go here once a week; the staff is super nice. Say hi to Tim the Manager cause He is always a charmer!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza to go.
Terrible service.... total disregard of customer's order details, not to mention, ---zero decorum when it comes to customer attention and 'basic' hospitality.
They even sent me out the door without my Pizza in the bag: Only the salad items.
Unbelievably bad experience. Won't be back.

Where'd they find these people?, at an All-Night Dominos?
At least when you buy from Dominos, you get the pizza you paid for."}
{"text":"Calzone was huge and very tasty. Pineapple and tomatoes were fresh.  Also had the lasagna which was 3 meals worth and delicious.  Tried the margarehta pizza had a bit too much roasted garlic for our taste but was golden brown. Hubby had the pasta with roasted red peppers that he said was very good. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Love Babbo. They presented catering options at work and that was my first impression Becky is awesome. I've got food to go and also ordered in at work. Awesome food and Monday and Tuesday spaghetti and meatball special cannot be beat."}
{"text":"accidentally found this place during our AZ visit (while looking for mcdonalds).
saw that they have good Yelp reviews so hubby and I came down here on our last night of vacay for dinner.

the menu was pretty large which was good.
drinks were also served -we had caramel apple cocktail and was very glad to have 'em.

our server (forgot his name) was very nice and helpful.  made our dining experience really good.
we had the \"egg roll\" and they were good
hubs ordered the mac n cheese-- very rich but otherwise tasty
while I had the cajun pasta-- spicy yet good.

the portion size was really huge
price was good

too bad I don't live close by"}
{"text":"Tasty Italian.  Yes, there's definitely the feel of the chain Italian place that it is, but if you're in the neighborhood and you're in the mood for pasta, this place will satisfy your craving for noodles and sauce.

I had the Pasta Bolognese, and my wife had the Chicken Lemone.  Delicious all around.  Top that off with bread (perfect for dipping in balsamic vinegar or leftover sauce), and you have a satisfying meal.

Service was friendly too and the ambiance was pleasant.  I'm always in the mood for good priced pasta, and Babbo gave me what I was looking for.  If you've seen their billboards and was wondering what they were like, I can vouch for their good taste on multiple levels."}
{"text":"My family & I ate here this week and I have to say, I loved it!! I couldn't decide on 2 dishes. One with pesto and the other not. The waiter recommended getting the one without and adding the pesto sauce to it. I did and it was amazing!! The staff is friendly with great service. Definitly coming back!"}
{"text":"Great meatball sandwich! Great prices for happy hour! Great atmosphere! Great service! The speghetti was like ehhh....according to my wife"}
{"text":"Monday nights are Spaghetti Night - get it with their famous meatballs and you're in for a real treat. These guys know how to turn \"plain ol' spaghetti\" into a fabulous dinner. This place is noisy ('cause everyone is here!) and is good for families AND date night. 

Babbo has a good bottled beer selection, but I am really bummed they don't have draft beer. If they did, I would be back in to visit far more often. Craft beer is all the rage, and so many restaurants provide draft craft that we are spoiled ... and it sucks to have to drink from bottles!

I'll keep going for Spag night ... and will come even more often when I see draft taps :)

4 stars for everything perfect, minus craft beer. It will be 5 stars when they get at least a couple draft pulls."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  The bread and oil is to die for, YUM!  Sometimes service can be a little slow."}
{"text":"This was my third attempt to finally eat and try this restaurant. Average welcome...nothing to talk home about. Finally seated after a wait of nearly 45 minutes. This restaurant is very busy due mostly from the current \"crop\" of snow birds in the area which is great for all businesses. Food is generally American Italian and good. There really is nothing new on the menu but the it is all really affordable. They do have luncheon menu but the Monday and Tuesday evening special is a real deal. Spaghetti and giant meatballs is a great value. There is NO SOUP on the menu...what a shame since I do enjoy soup with evening meals. Somewhat noisy but comfortable environment. Waiters are friendly. Limited Italian wines on the list. Overall, it is an easy dining experience with standard food but of excellent value. I recommend it for casual dining with friends."}
{"text":"They handled our party of 21 like a champ! Sat us outside on the patio and our food came out in excellent time. I recommend the red pepper alfredo dish. Bonus- free bread while you wait for the food to come! Also gluten free pasta sub is FREE! WELCOME CELIACS! Also whole wheat pasta sub is also free."}
{"text":"Strip mall location.  Decent size portions. The wedge salad is crazy good. Negatives are cheap plastic glassware and high prices. $7 for a pint of beer? No way. Service was pretty good given the fact that a manager was also assisting the wait staff."}
{"text":"Been coming here  since this location opened since we live in the area.Food is always good, but lately our last few visits have had some pretty rotten service not to mention some of the negative actions or comments from the staff and one female manager in particular. I use to enjoy coming here but I'm apprehensive now. Some other people we know have had the similar experiences."}
{"text":"The Lasagna is the BOMB!!! I only had 2 bites of it and OMG... The richness of the sauce and sausage was amazing.... I had the Roasted Brussel Sprouts and it was amazing also... along with the Chopped  Wedge Salad...  This is a place you want to frequent for sure..."}
{"text":"Went for the $5.99 spaghetti and meatball special.

Was a long-ish wait, but not too bad.

Food was good. The garlic spread was delicious, and the bread was very good, and plentiful.

I'd probably go back."}
{"text":"once again some ones children can ruin a night out for dinner, and management did nothing about it.   What a shame, that management is afraid to say something to one table but allows 10 to 15 tables to suffer the screaming, and constant running of a child thru the restaurant.   i could have given them 5 stars had they just said something to these people.   Had it not been for the good taste of the spaghetti and meatballs, i would have given them only 1 star.

Wake up management, because of your in action we will not be back, and the table next to us that was ran into by this child say to us they would not be back.......      SORRY MANAGEMENT BUT I WORK TO HARD FOR MY MONEY TO SPEND IT AT A PLACE THAT DOES NOT RESPECT THERE CUSTOMERS"}
{"text":"I must say I love love love the meatballs.  On our bimonthly dinner outing with my mother, we picked Italian and she suggested we come to Babbo's as i am always reluctant to try new Italian places because of my Italian heritage has set the bar really high, and most Italian seem to disappoint.  I must say Babbo's did not disappoint me.  

We came on a Tuesday night which is spaghetti and meatball special night, and all though the restaurant was very busy, I feel the service was great. As busy as Scott (our server) was he was very attentive.  Scott was knowledgeable of his menu and of the restaurant. Great job, cause he was able to accommodate my demanding mom.

 We did not know of the special before we came, and as we where being seated I notice a lot of people had \"the special\"  I ask our waiter if it was the special and he told us on Monday/Tuesday nights that's what the special was.

What I noticed about \"the special\" was the meatballs were huge, and the spaghetti had an ample amount of sauce in and on the spaghetti  which I love, because it all about the the sauce.   which was a very simple great favored sauce.      It was so good I got 2 additional \"specials\" TOGO.

I have to be honest after finding out what the special was I did not look at most of the menu, but the pricing seemed very fair overall. And i guess i will just have to go again to try other dishes.

I gave 5 stars because my overall experience was great.

The only compliant I have is the add on salad is $3.95 and is super tiny. And it is a reach out to management to make the salad less expense or make it bigger.    

I am glad to see that they have location in the northwest metro phoenix area since we live in the southwest area of metro phoenix.   If you would open in the Goodyear/Avondale area I promise to become a regular"}
{"text":"I loved the bread and oil appetizer. I loved the service. When it comes to the food, I can say that my daughters loved the children's menu. Plus, the host was very good about making sure the high chair I received was clean for my daughter. They both got a very nice size drink: lemonade and chocolate milk. So parents of smaller children beware the drinks for kids are very big. The kids pizza and macaroni and cheese was very good according to my children, but the noodles they used in the macaroni and cheese were very big. I had to cut them in half so that my daughter could comfortably eat and that was a little off-putting.  I personally feel that if it is on the children's menu  that  but noodles should be small enough to fit into a child's mouth.  The noodles have ridges so if your child has a sensory issue they may not like it. The friends I was with  ordered two of the regular salads,  which were a very good size. They both said that their salads were delicious so I may have gone wrong with what I ordered. My own food, quite honestly, was not very appealing to me. I had the steak rusticana and it was very bland. The bread had a very nice flavor, but the steak and vegetables were very dry with very little horseradish sauce being used. It could have been what I ordered, but overall it just wasn't very good. I would rather go somewhere that has great service and good food. I would love to give this restaurant more than two stars, however the food for me just was not very good especially for the amount that was paid."}
{"text":"Food was good waiter was a little slow at first that's why the 3 stars, but made up for that as he took our food order. I am not a big pasta eater but they do have a substitute ( zucchini noodles) I had the chicken parmigiana was very fair not the best I ever had but great for the price and portion. If I had to compare it to another Italian food it would more like a 2 steps above Olive Garden. I would go again but not a place I would put on a weekly rotation."}
{"text":"I have eaten in this restaurant several times over the last 3 years. I always give it another try after a long period of time goes by. Then when I go back I remember exactly why it's been so long. Value for the price. When I go to a pizza place and order a pepperoni pizza, I don't expect to hunt to find a piece of pepperoni on it when I open the box.  I'm always dissappointed when I go to this place. especially when I drop $60 - $70 and my kids eat 3 bowls of pasta.  there's just too many other restaurants to try that will give you better value for my money. Service is ok, fook is good, (when they get it right) I give this place a 5 on a scale of 0-10.  (it's missable.)"}
{"text":"Was here today with hubby and daddy.   Food was good but not worth the price.   The salad I got mista (or something like that)  with the balsamic vinegar was by far my favorite.   Pizza was oky just really oily...  Cheese of the pizza was more gummy then stringy.   I did like the cut up the pepperoni so it wouldnt be too overwhelming and salty.   Appetizer we ordered a garlic spread which was not worth getting.   Didnt even have a garlic taste just had an oily taste.   We did like the pesto mozzarella bread.   That was pretty tasty!   Our bill for LUNCH was over $60...  and we werent even at Scottsdale lol.   Oh well."}
{"text":"Try their $5.99 spagetti with meatballs.  It's really excellent, as are the portions.   U can't miss on this deal."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Babbo's for lunch today. We were seated within a few minutes and our waitress was at the table shortly there after. I had the spaghetti bolognese and she had a salad and pizza. Our meal was served promptly and it was hot. After eating the meal I was left with the feeling it was chain restaurant food. The food was good but not what you would most likely get at a mom and pop Italian restaurant. For me I would continue to search for that mom and pop. I love Italian food and the more authentic the better."}
{"text":"Enjoying our meal.  Our server Amy knows the menu and is pleasant and efficient.  Good Italian margarita."}
{"text":"Had their Italiano Sandwich today, very disappointing! When I picked up my \"sandwich\" for a togo order I actually told the girl she gave me the wrong order. It looked exactly like a salad on top of flat bread. She checked the order and told me it was correct. She offered to refund which I decided not too. It tasted terrible! Super soggy bread, gross meat, and about 6 diced tomatoes. If I had to rate this place based on the sandwich I would give it a 0, but their pastas are pretty good."}
{"text":"I ordered the mac and cheese to go the other night. This place has the to go routine down perfectly. When I got home there was 2 pieces of bread that was really great with a small container of oil and vinegar. This was a nice surprise. I had a small Cesar salad which had the dressing packet separate so it wasn't soggy at all. There was also a container with pepper flakes and another with Parmesan. I thought everything was really good although the sausage was more spicy then I would prefer in a mac and cheese. I will use the to go service more often now."}
{"text":"Recently a friend took me out for a birthday lunch at Babbo Italian at Rural and Ray roads and we had a wonderful meal.  The pasta was amazing and the salads are great and they offer a small and large option so you can order a smaller portion which I really like!  Oh and they do have gluten free pasta for those of you with a gluten issue. They do have a bar area with happy hour specials where you could actually stop in after work close to home.

This Babbo location is in the Fry's shopping center at the NW corner of Ray and Rural and it sits towards the western end of the complex.  

The waitstaff was great and very friendly and the atmosphere was warm and inviting.  I will make this a regular stop from now on.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What an absolutely awesome place. The food here is delicious, and I simply cannot get enough of their cheese calzone. I will be back again and again and again.  The restaurant is kind of small and can get really crowded, but the food is absolutely worth it. Great for families, dates, kids. We really love it."}
{"text":"Can't beat the spaghetti and meatballs on Mondays and Tuesdays for $5.99. But, there are also several pasta dishes that are worth it; the 3 cheese mac and cheese is a favorite of my family and my own personal favorite is the creamy garlic chicken pasta dish. A great thing with Babbo, also, is that they will let you change the type of pasta for your pasta entree. Don't like penne, fine. Change it to linguine. 

Their pizza is excellent, as well. You can not go wrong with any of their pizza."}
{"text":"Had a pleasant but mostly unremarkable meal here on a Thursday evening near closing (9 pm).  The highlight of the experience was the service, which we found friendly and gracious despite our having arrived just before closing time.  The server proved attentive and acted unhurried, though I expect he was eager to wrap up the work-day.

The food was okay.  Menu items sounded appealing, but quality of ingredients and/or preparation was just adequate.  The chopped salad had pale lettuce, meat in the steak pasta tasted very salty.  We probably would not return, given the large number of better, comparably priced Italian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"The bread is the best bread I've had. The bring dipping sauce. It's pretty good too. The food is fresh and delicious as well. I got the stuffed shells with white sauce instead of red sauce. The best white sauce too! The service is fast and very kind and attentive. It had a great atmosphere as well. Great location!"}
{"text":"First experience at Babbo! 

We ordered 3 kids meals (cheese calzone, pepperoni calzone and spaghetti w/meatballs) and an item off the chalkboard menu (chicken with pesto primavera and a side caesar) all to go. The kids enjoyed the calzones but what stole the show were the meatballs! The bread that came with the order was delicious too! My chalkboard item was fine but not amazing. 

We are definitely excited to come back and try other things off the menu! The girl at the takeout counter was friendly and our order came up quickly!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try out Babbo and finally did this past weekend with 2 friends. Their menu is extensive so we asked the waiter what he would suggest. He quickly came up with different dishes that he thought we may enjoy. I ordered a salad, my boyfriend ordered the meatball sandwich and my friend ordered a pasta with a side of meatball. All were delicious! We also ordered the dessert (fried dough balls with ice cream and whipped cream). That was equally as delicious. The restaurant has great decor and friendly staff. The food was great. The prices were reasonable. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great!  On our last day in Glendale we wanted to find somewhere different to eat.  We heard about this place by word of mouth (Cleats Sports).  We are so glad they let us know about Bobbo!  The bread and oil dip served complimentarily was a great start.  We also ordered the garlic cheese crostini which was delicious.  For the main course I ordered the Parmesan Chicken Pasta which was plenty for 2 meals.  The chicken was amazing as well as the pasta and sauce.  My husband ordered Amy's Lasagna.  It was the best lasagna he has ever had.  The cheese just oozes out and the flavoring was out of this world.  Needless to say, the entrees left no room for dessert.  Last but not least, our waiter, Dominic--- did a great job.  He was very attentive and had a great personality.  We would absolutely recommend this restaurant and hope to stop back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"There are quite a few good Italian Restaurants around this area, but often they often have a limited  number dishes for a vegetarians.  I have to give these guys high marks for the variety of creative and  vegetarian dishes. We split a the beet and brussel sprout salad and a pasta prima vera dish both of which were very good. The Tiramisu was very good, but not quite as good as Vincitorios along the road.
I have been twice now in the last 2 weeks and on both occasions I was curious to see how organized they were and if there would be any service hiccups in the first week of opening.  Despite being pretty busy on both occasions - the service held up well. Decor is good and eating out on the patio is great, but i would recommend they invest in a misting system for patio before the temps rise any more.

Overall high marks for friendly efficient service, great selection of good food and nice decor. lets hope they keep the high standards up.

11/23/12 Update

Overall still enjoy coming here - wife especially loves the vegetarian options. She usually goes with the beet salad.  Must admit the last 2 times we have been they had got the order wrong  and meals had to be returned and done over again.  Marked them down a little for that. Service is always friendly, food tasty and ambiance good. Let's hope they get the next order correct?

12/1/13 - Quality of the food and service  has definitely gone downhill over the last year. Pity cos it seemed very promising at first."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here about once a month. It's one of our favorite places to eat. The food is delicious, prices reasonable, and the management is attentive. The homemade tiramisu is amazing btw. We are glad to have a great place to eat that is so close to our home."}
{"text":"Just okay, nothing to write home about, basically fast food Italian, as long as that all you expect then it delivers."}
{"text":"Yum. Only wish this place was closer to my side of town so I could eat there more often.  Babbo (doesn't this mean Santa in Italian?) is a neighborhood Italian food joint that gives you big, tasty portions of food for little prices.

My friend and I always go here with her fam when she's in town, and I always look forward to it. The menu is filled with tons of pastas and all the regular Italian fare you'd expect to find, but they also have some great, unexpected desserts.

They have this apple calzone that is so freaking good, but the only downside is that it takes forever to cook.  Order it while you're still eating your dinner so you won't be sitting there for another 30 minutes waiting on it. They also have a huge half baked cookie dessert kinda like the amazing one at Oregano's. And while it's not as good, it comes pretty close. The desserts are ginormous, so sharing is best."}
{"text":"I've passed by here a million times and finally decided to give them a try! Amazing food and service! The lunch specials that are super affordable! Fresh made food and a great vibe! I had the Cesar side salad and Pasta of the day (pancetta and Brussel Sprouts) which was amazing! Fresh bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar at the beginning of your meal is ! 

I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Their Spaghetti & Meatballs is pretty good ... certainly a large portion for a reasonable price.  Their warm bread, however, is outstanding.  We eat so much of those tasty baked goodies that we end up eating only half our meal.  Guess what.  Plenty of leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

During the winter, be prepared for lines there for the Monday and Tuesday spaghetti special."}
{"text":"We had heard great reviews about this place, so we were excited to try it. We even took advice from people that love this place on the appetizer so as to be sure to sample something that had been vouched for.

The wait to get in was fairly long. This location was quite small, so that was part of the problem, but it also seemed popular.

The service was great. We were provided with suggestions on a completely unfamiliar menu & all requests were promptly addressed. That is were the 2 stars come from.

The food was below average at best. The bread & oil was some of the worst I've had. The bread was bland, flat, & burnt. In fact, the burnt pieces had the most flavor, albeit a charcoal flavor. We had the fried ravioli appetizers. Frozen food much? Yah, they tasted & looked like they came right out of the freezer. If they weren't, then somebody is really screwing these up in the kitchen. Finally, we shared a meatball sandwich. I mean really, that is tough to mess-up, right?? The bread was odd; some kind of flat bread instead of a hoagie bun. That bread was also burnt & the sandwich was dry. We had to request a side of sauce.

The couple we were with raved about a turkey sandwich they ordered, but a turkey sandwich with deli meat requires no cooking, so no wonder that was the best thing at the table. I seriously doubt we'll ever go back. We'd go to Brio or Carrabbas first. Hell, I'd do Olive Garden before this place."}
{"text":"My family and i went here 2 Sundays ago and i really like the new place!  The waitress was great and kept our water filled and brought more bread to eat when we had devoured what we had. I ordered the lemon chicken piccata and had angel hair pasta with it. DELICIOUS! was a good amount and was nice and hot! very full when leaving! :)"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Despite the ads around town, this is not good Italian.  The value may be decent given the portions here to the price, but that doesn't overcome sub-par Italian food.

Came here with my wife.  We had the bolognese and spaghetti and meatballs.  Both were over-sauced.  Waaaaay over-sauced.  And both were extremely over-seasoned, too salty.  Appreciated that the bolognese was pretty meaty, but the meatballs were overly hard.  

One saving grace, the noodles were al dente and not overcooked.

Based on the sauce alone, it would take a lot for us to come back.  Not the worst Italian I've ever had, but it's getting close to there, unfortunately."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so classy and the food is so tasty! We came in on a night where they were only charging $ 6.99 for spaghetti and two big homemade meatballs! And the service matched the quality of the food. Our server's name was Liz and she just absolutely made us feel at home. She answered all our questions and was always there to check in on us with a smile. You really don't see that anymore these days. This place is must if you are craving Italian. Oh and get a pizza cookie for dessert!"}
{"text":"Babbo Italian Eatery has raised the bar for Italian food. The restaurant offers to substitute vegetable zucchini noodles in place of regular pasta noodles. For an extra buck fitty, I think it's worth not dealing with the gluten.

I ordered Pasta Primavera and a Bianca pizza pie. Complementary fixings included focaccia bread, oil / balsamic vinegar blend, parmesan cheese, and pepper flakes. 

Babbo's pizza crust is delicious. Nice chew and it held the pizza toppings. On my personal 10\" bianca pie came tomatoes, spinach, ricotta, parmesan, rosemary and garlic. I asked for no mozzarella, but then added peppers, broccoli, and basil.

Basically, my bianca turned into a verde. With the additions, it cost $13.45 for the pie.

Pasta primavera came with mixed peppers, broccoli, zucchini, mushrooms, diced and sun dried tomatoes in garlic butter sauce over  zucchini noodles. $15.75. The spiralized zucchini was cooked perfectly. Soft, but still had a fresh vegetable crunch that didn't get soggy in the steam. I could twirl those noodles for days. And that garlic butter sauce though! 

Gim'me a bottle of it. Yum yum. https://youtu.be/oATjH460nZ4"}
{"text":"The food is yummy! The bowl servings are pretty big, the bread they bring out (for free) is so fresh! The service is good, & food comes out fast, even when busy."}
{"text":"Babbo is a great choice for Italian.

Located next to Frys on Rural and Ray.  We frequent takeout more often then dine-in. They have reserved spaces and a special door for takeout which makes it very handy.  

If you dine in it is casual and very hip. Well decorated, trendy lights, lots of tables, booths and a bar area to the left.  

Look for coupons in the Wednesday mail.  Altbough, the prices are very reasonable.  Complimentary wRm bread and olive oil is a great start.

My dear wife likes the chalkboard menu. The chalkboard menu is an assortment of different dishes and your choice of meat.  The roasted asparagus salad with chicken is a favorite.  

The kids calzones are amazing and enormous. The choice for kids is pepperoni or cheese.  The adult calzone is enormous and wonderful as well they have a special which has pepperoni mushroom and sausage. Big enough for two meals.  

If you get takeout ask for extra marinara for the calzones. Also with takeout complimentary bread is provided which is a nice touch. They even have a small container for the olive oil balsamic dipping sauce.

I have always found service to be friendly and quick.  Last night we had Emily J as our server. She was great.  Attentive and very helpful."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch and unfortunately the food took a while to be served.  The prices seemed high for lunch time and they didn't really have a lunch menu.  I ordered an Italian sandwich and I received something that really didn't resemble a sandwich at all. 

Most likely not coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is the Pei Wei of Italian food, except you get a waiter.  No, it's not the best restaurante in town, the food is quasi-fresh but it's quick and fills you up.  They have a great menu selection, services was great and the prices were ok.  

Maybe it's me, Italian food was meant to be romantic and you want to see some Italian running the joint with a name like Luigi or Papageorgio.  This place was far from that..."}
{"text":"Good food, good friendly service and reasonably priced. As an Italian I am quite picky about Italian cuisine, especially my pasta. If you like pasta, you'll love Babbo's. Plenty of choices. I've tried 3 different dishes and they are all good. From meatless to chicken, shrimp or steak. For those who are watching their carbs, they also have a variety of salads and non-carb dishes."}
{"text":"Par Italian... with Excellent Bread

Visited Babbo's with some coworkers for dinner.  We were located on the patio and it was a pretty good experience overall.

First, the Italian bread with oil and balsamic vinegar was excellent. It set up some high expectations. For dinner, I had the misto salad with the spicy sausage and penne dish. Both were tasty and on par with one expects at an Italian eatery.

On the service side, there was gap from ordering drinks to receiving them and I had to ask our water twice for one refill. There was also a long delay before we were able to order and then another before food hit the table. That said, all the staff were very pleasant. 

One issue was that it was so cold sitting on the patio. One heater was placed where waitstaff stands and the other behind a pillar from us. That left our side of the patio to shiver together. One person mentioned how cold it was to a waitress delivering food, but nothing was done.

I wonder if our group size was just too large for the staff to manage. The folks inside seemed to have a good time and did not take as long to finish their meals as us. I watched one table turn twice in the time we finished. 

Maybe I'll go with my wife to see if it would be a better experience. She loves her Italian and definitely will not refuse."}
{"text":"Been to this place twice now; it's good, not great.

I'm married to an Italian, so I'm lucky enough to get traditional (delicious) Italian food.  I wanted to try this place because it's close to home and I had heard some great things about it.

It's not a very large, and the service is a little spotty. The second time we came the bar tender was seating people because there didn't appear to be a hostess.  So it took about 5-6 minutes to get a table when the entire restaurant was open. 

The bread with oil and balsamic vinegar is pretty dang good. My husband ate 3 plates full the last time we were there... I may have helped him with the 3 plates full lol.

The first time I tried the Spicy Alfredo with Italian Sausage.  The sausage is REALLY GOOD, definitely has some heat to it! The sauce good, it could have used a little more mushrooms in my opinion. 

The second time I tried the Creamy Mushroom and Asparagus Pasta.  The asparagus seemed a little undercooked, and the sauce was okay, a little bland. 

Everyone is very friendly and the décor is nice. I'd like to go back and try a salad; I've seen them walk by our table a couple times and they look really good."}
{"text":"This place is by far one of the best Italian places in the valley. Their food is always consistently delicious, it's quick, and the service has always been top notch. Everyone at this location always goes above and beyond to help you and they always have an excellent attitude."}
{"text":"Ordered to-go a few weeks ago and waited about an hour and 15 mins in the restaurant for my order to be ready. I ordered the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo, when I got home and opened my container there was a small amount of pasta drowning in sauce. So much sauce it was ridiculous. Very disappointed to pay $15 for a meal that was basically inedible. The bread with balsamic vinegar and olive oil was very good however. I don't think I'll be returning here anymore which is unfortunate because I used to love this restaurant."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this. I had Brussels with pancetta and my husband had a couple of salads. There were flavors! The basil lemon vinaigrette was excellent. Or server,  Rene, was very knowledgeable and helped me navigate the gluten free items. Sadly, there was no gluten free dessert. What? With such an extensive gf menu I was surprised. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"My wife had traveled to Phoenix for work and her coworkers took her here for lunch. She said we would have to try it if we were ever in Phoenix. 

So, on our way home, we found ourselves about five minutes from this location... perfect chance to try it.

She knows what I like, bless her heart, and I was not disappointed in Babbo.

They start you off with soft focaccia bread, which, when it's 2:30 in the afternoon and this is your first meal, does not last long. Olive oil and balsamic vinegar are poured on a plate for your dipping pleasure. Very good.

Daughter #1and I had the pizza and salad special. We both got the Pepperoni, Sausage and Mushroom pizza. I got the Mista salad and she got the house salad. The only thing on the salad she did not like, was the golden raisins. She picked them out and put them on my plate... I was happy to oblige. You could see them in the kitchen tossing pizza dough, so we got nice, fresh pizza. My daughter announced, \"this is the best pizza I have ever had\". I won't go that far, but it was really good.

Daughter #2 - Fettuccine Alfredo (I think she must have cream and parmesan cheese coursing through her veins by now). was enjoyed thoroughly.

Wife - Pasta Martini (their version of Penne Vodka) was her choice. She enjoyed it, but the addition of Kalamata olives was slightly odd. She said it was overkill and seemed like they did not belong.

I liked the ambience and the price was fairly reasonable. Babbo seems to be a Phoenix chain. It would be nice if they would expand into an area near us. I think I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Enjoy Monday & Tuesday spaghetti special.  A must stop when visiting the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Not sure why I gave 1 star since I didn't even get seated. We showed up 35 minutes before they closed & a waiter walks up & told me they \"aren't seating anymore\" ?!? Huh??? Sign says you close at 9pm & it's only 8:25pm?!? With an ignorant look & a shrug, he says \"we're closing up early.\"  Ok...so your hours on your website & door are just there for looks?!? What a joke. Too many other good places around where they focus on service & actually want your business."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our second visit to Babbo. The Monday and Tuesday spaghetti special is a great deal. They have a nice selection of dishes, some quite unique. My wife had a pasta dish with Brussels sprouts as one of the ingredients...very good. The bread is great."}
{"text":"This is a really enjoyable addition to the neighborhood. I used to spend my friday nights here when it was Nick's 24/7 pizza. There used to be punk rock shows all the time. Babbo did away with the old floorplan completely and turned it into a really nice little modern neighborhood spot.

I sat at the bar alone and had the penne with pink sauce, garlic, and chicken. It was a ginormous bowl of pasta for $10 and I think I may be one of the only ones who could actually finish it. VALUE. It wasn't super low quality crap either. It was decent food. They also include your before dinner bread and olive oil. All and all with an iced tea it was $14 including tip. 

It's a solid place and the staff was very friendly. I had conversation with three staff members while I was there and they all seemed happy to work where they do. Happy staff = happy customers."}
{"text":"My name is Aneasha, and I'm addicted to bread.

Thankfully I am able to fulfill my bread cravings at Babbo's! Upon entering I was greeting with warm, delicious bread along with olive oil & balsamic vinegar. This tasty introduction was just what I needed to hold me over until the main course arrived.

Unfortunately, I wasn't as thrilled with my Alfredo. The chicken was chunked and resembled something that came out of a can. I've had freshly grilled chicken before, and that wasn't it. Despite that hiccup I did still enjoy my dinner.

Now on to dessert. The The Original Big Baked Babbo immediately caught my eye. I tried not to compare it to Oregano's Pizzoki, but lets me realistic.. the Pizzoki is a hard act to follow! I had high hopes for the Big Baked Babbo but I was let down. There was no ice cream or whipped cream available (I wasn't advised of this ahead of time) so all I had for desert was a slightly burnt cookie. Needless to say.. Oreganos Wins.

Overall, my experience at Babbo's wasn't the worst, but it definitely wasn't the best either. I'm willing to give them another chance. Hopefully next time they will have ice cream on hand."}
{"text":"Wow! I am beyond stunned at the customer service I received. I want to say so much, but I am literally speechless. After I wrote my review, someone contacted me and apologized for my experience. I want to say that the food is great! I will get that beet and brussel salad 10 times over. It wasn't the food that was bad, it was the waiter who was a little strange. All in all, I will definitely return. Their customer service is really top notch!"}
{"text":"Ok... maybe I was in a \"mood' because I don't usually go out to eat mainstream Italian because I think mine is better. But we ordered the Firecracker rolls expecting spicy yummies. YUK! the overwhelming heat masked any of the other flavors. Then, because I wanted something spicy I order the Sausage & Penne pasta expecting little burst of spicy sausage every now and again. Instead, you guessed it, overwhelming heat. It didn't say \"Fra Diavolo\" so I think my expectations were in line. I really dislike restaurants that don't pay attention to the nuance of flavor. Maybe all the spaghetti and meatballs you can eat is what they're good at? My husband loved his chicken special so that's why I'm giving it two stars plus they didn't charge me for the rolls or pasta that I didn't eat."}
{"text":"Never knew this place was there. Food was great and service was just as good. Definitely a place to go for some great Italian food!"}
{"text":"It's always so nice to come in, i ordered Chipotle Chicken this time with side sriracha. It taste so well and just love it!"}
{"text":"Way to lose an online customer Babbo! We decided to order online tonight since I had gotten home late and would be convenient for my daughter to just run in and pick it up.  We ordered 2 entrees and a salad and arrived at the time promised. The food was ready but bread wasn't, they told my daughter to wait and it would be out shortly since they were busy in store and online we had to wait for bread- not our problem you didn't produce enough or give accurate times for pickup which would've allowed for bread... so my daughter waits....after 20 minutes I called her and said what's going on?? She tells me that the people in the restaurant can't go without bread so we had to wait for some, I tell her ask if it's done because if not our food will now be cold (which her calzone was) and the cheese on the salad which was bagged with the pasta was now melted too.. she left with no bread and no apologies. The only reason I gave 2 stars is the pasta was hot... that's it. In this day & age when customers chose convenient options trust me Babbo you need to up your game. Your competitors treat online and brick and mortar the same..take some hints. Who eats pasta without some bread for the sauce...not us."}
{"text":"Strip mall Italian restaurant with above average food. Great value for the price. My children love their spaghetti and meatballs. Have been visiting for quite some time and never have had a bad experience. Only problem is that they have outgrown their restaurant. Usually a wait in the evenings. Other than that, food is great, service is good ."}
{"text":"Very poor service. I tried to make things right and they got defensive and rude. Looks like new staff. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Wish I could like this place?  Being close to where I live, but what do you expect?

1. Inexpensive Italian food=inexpensive flavor.
2. Crowd=snowbirds
3. Basic ingredients=basic italian food.

I will try my hand at spagehetti and meatballs, I think I have a 50/50 chance of doing it better?  DIne here on the cheap...if thats what you are looking for?"}
{"text":"I have been addicted to this place as of late. ALL of their Italian sandwiches are fantastic. You can't beat these sandwiches for $10.  Great fresh food at a great value. I like to order online and pick up on the way home from work for dinner. The food is always ready freaky fast for take out. Not to mention they include some fresh baked bread and oil/vinegar for dipping.  My kids love their spaghetti and meatballs and I love the value, can't beat those kids meals for $6 including a drink. Great job, keep it up!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The Oven roasted Brussels Sprouts and Pancetta pasta is soo good, actually everything we've had so far has been great. Our go to Italian place to eat."}
{"text":"If Olive Garden is Italian McDonald's, then this place is like an Italian Applebees or Outback.  It's a step up because of the environment itself; it's chic, clean, unique design, and overall nice.  The people who created the menu and respectively cook the food are not, by ANY definition, Italian.  As an Italian, not an I-talian, would never set foot in this place again unless it was to drink wine and dunk the soft foccia bread in oil. Skip this if you're looking for anything else."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the service.  We arrived at 6:15 and were given 4 plates of bread because the kitchen ended up being backed up. Finally received our food, which was okay.  Then we had to wait 30 minutes to wait to speak to a manager, as their computers went down. Apparently people are incapable of creating a bill and taking them that way?  Would not recommend this place at all!"}
{"text":"Looking for something other than fast food and came
across Babbo's.  Ordered the Chipotle pasta and a side caesar salad to go, not expecting much but it was actually really good.  The only problem was that there was nothing to eat it with...Note to management;  Train your employees to include utensils with to go orders. :/"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant with inside and patio seating. Bar options are diverse as is the happy hour menu. Starter bread is top notch. Spaghetti with meatballs and Alfredo Supremo are dishes we tasted and enjoyed very much. Pasta was cooked to perfection and sauces are fresh and taste great. Only reason I didn't give a five star rating was because the waiter didn't refill our drinks as quickly as one would expect."}
{"text":"I've come to the new Bell Road location a few times now. I'm upgrading my rating to five stars because they continuously impress me. I've been here many times after the four star visit. Great customer service, efficient and delicious. Favorite dishes are: Alfredo Supremo, mozzarella balls and Amy's lasagna. The starter bread is excellent, too. The double chocolate cookie dessert is a great finisher. Very rich and delicious."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Babbo's. I wasn't expecting it to be back in a shopping center. I guess I pictured it to be more like Carrabba's. The place was packed and very noisy! We waited about 15 minutes before being seated and then waited several more minutes before anyone came to take our drink order. Several minutes passed and someone else came to take our drink order. Hmmm... confusion. Even more time passed and I started to think about leaving to go somewhere else when our waters and bread finally came. I ordered the spaghetti & meatballs. The restaurant was so loud, it was like a roar. I couldn't hardly think in there. We were sitting next to a large party of women too so it was even worse. The service picked up in the second half. Our waiter let us know the food would be out soon and apologized for the wait. We got our food at the same time as a table that was seated long after us. The spaghetti was good, but it had a lot of sauce! I like sauce, but it was swimming. The meatballs were tasty, but nothing I can't get anywhere else. When the check came, I was surprised to see my meal was only $5.99! How can I complain about that? I guess they do a special on Mondays. Nevertheless, I don't think I'll be making the drive to come back here."}
{"text":"Nice little place. We had a late lunch and it was very nice. Bread great,  service great. I have found that if you go during prime time be ready to wait. But you should expect that if the place is good. I will go there again and bring friends."}
{"text":"Food is great and priced very affordable.  Aimee is the best server and their beer is cold. Great for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and it's always been a good experience and good food. However, I had friends in town and took them there and the service was horrible!  Our server, Eric, acted like he had better things to do, and the place wasn't even half full!!  It took forever to take our order, and he didn't even bring out 2 of the items we ordered. We had to keep asking him to bring the food we ordered, and you could tell it was an inconvenience. It usually takes a really bad experience for me to write a bad review, but since the service was an embarrassment to me and my friends, I couldn't let it go. The bad part is that it probably will be a while before I go back. If at all."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and I can't say that I am impressed. I would equate it to fast food Italian restaurant. The flat bread with balsamic and oil was very delicious. My boyfriend had the super chopped Mediterranean salad which was just a bunch of kale chopped up very few Mediterranean ingredients. I had the stuffed portobello mushroom. The mushroom was very good but the sausage tasted like Sysco sausage and the marinara tasted like canned tomato sauce and was very runny. Jesse,however, was very attentive and we were impressed with his service."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday evening. Chose to wait for a bar booth and was happy with it. Spacious seating, warm atmosphere, friendly staff. The food though...AMAZING! This is some of the best Italian food I've had in Arizona. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Monday & Tuesday Special. $5.99 Spaghetti & Meatballs. Great Value. Very filling & the bread & unique olive oil dipping sauce is what's commonly referred to as \" the Bomb ! \""}
{"text":"Ive been reluctant to try Babbo but it's in the neighborhood and I heard decent reviews so we gave it a shot. We ordered Gorgonzola salad and the Creamy Mushroom, Asparagus Pasta and added shrimp for $5.95. The salad was great and very plentiful of veggies, fruit and cheese, highly recommend. We were really disappointed with the pasta dish. We got it to go and felt the noodles were half portion and we literally got four small shrimp.  I am hoping someone responds to provide us a redo on the pasta take out as it wasn't a full order and we want to give it another shot. I'd give 2.5 stars but wasn't an option. Thank you."}
{"text":"I want to like this place but I've been half a dozen times since they opened this location and the food is never up to par. The salads are never fresh and the sauces are bland. The redemption is the bread with the olive oil/balsamic dip.  How can you mess that up?"}
{"text":"Better than average Italian food, but the desserts... leave room!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service from the manager. I waited to order food to go and she just looked at me annoyed and said she was busy and I had to wait. Then she walked to the back of house. Later another staff member took my order.... only after i flagged him down."}
{"text":"This is simply okay strip mall Italian. Does it beat the rest of the suburban feedlot fare - olive garden, cheese cake, etc? Yes. But, not by much. I'd say that they ingredients used are sub-par, or - more likely - purchased at the safeway next door.

We had pizza and the spaghetti dish. Pizza was so-so. Spaghetti dish tasted like canned sauce over ordinary pasta. The menu isn't creative, but it caters well to the Glendale / Peoria market.

Oh, and the bread and olive oil couldn't be less ordinary. They have cooking-grade (or worse) olive oil. And, the bread - the night I went - was cold and fairly stale. Surely not made the same day."}
{"text":"Was our first time coming here, but I must say it won't be our last! The food was extremely tasty and our waiter went above and beyond his duties! I cannot thank our waiter and the chef's behind the kitchen enough for a wonderful experience! Unfortunately I didn't grab any pictures of the food because it's already inside our stomachs!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant in mesa. The ambience, food, service were excellent. The bread is to die for. Dean was excellent and funny.
Will be back many times in the future. A scottsdale restaurant finally in East Mesa!!
Yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"I'll never eat at an Olive Garden again! If I was on death row, I would request the Chicken Limone for my last meal. I've never had chicken so tender and well seasoned and a pasta so delightful on one plate. The Chicken Limone has capers, artichokes, lemon. All delicious. I was full about 2/3 through the meal and felt full but I finished because the flavors made me lose control. I blacked out and when I woke up I had licked the plate clean and assaulted a waiter trying to get more."}
{"text":"This place is really hit or miss.  Which is too bad, it is right around the corner from the house.  Let me address a few main things:

Service - pretty good, they always have an unusually high number of servers for a place this size...so at least they are attentive, although there are some interesting characters among the wait staff.

Price - very much affordable

Crowd - yep, pretty much retirement age.  Although my kids school did a fundraiser night there which changed it up a lot on that trip.  Went today, in 112 degrees so obviously not snowbird season, but still mostly the older crowd was there.

Food - I want to love it, but i just don't.  One trip had the Sicilian ragu and it was great.   Once had the cheap special spaghetti/meatballs and the sauce was horrible, yet the meatballs were excellent.  I've had that special several times and it tastes different most of the time.  One trip had a pizza and it was middle of the road.  Highly inconsistent.

Overall, we go back because the kids like it, it is relatively inexpensive, and it is close to home.  There are certainly better options out there for Italian, but this fits the need in certain circumstances."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I usually do not give out \"bad\" reviews. This was the 3rd time in about as many months that I dined at this neighborhood location in Cave Creek. I've ordered pizza, chicken fettuccini, and most recently lasagna and in all instances the meals have been undercooked and cold. Tonite this location was extremely busy and seemed short-staffed. Our waiter, Alec, was very attentive and apologetic regarding the wait time for our meals to arrive. But since it was one of those nights where I was suffering from food frump, I was willing to wait instead of cooking dinner at home. My lasagna finally arrived and looked good. I ate the outer edges which were cooler to touch than normal and as I continued, noted that the center was cold. I informed Alec of the situation who offered to rewarm my meal. I declined and asked for a to-go container and stated to him that I would just microwave it at home myself. When the check came, the price of the lasagna had been deducted from the total price of my family's dinner. As a local resident of Cave Creek with few dining options for decent Italian food without having to drive miles to eat, Babbo's has been a family choice. There is usually something there to eat for me and my finicky family. But cold and undercooked food? The next time I'm in the mood for lasagna, I'll pick up a frozen Stouffers from my local Safeway store and bake it myself. I don't plan on going back to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"So much better than Oregano's. They actually put sauce on their food, and the pizza crust is cooked. For a few dollars more, worth it. 
Also never had bad service here."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to get a good calzone. I had the cheese ravioli appetizer and a cheese calzone. Both were very good. I didn't get a chance to sample anything else on the menu but I hope to change that soon. The calzone alone is worth going back for. Service was also very good."}
{"text":"I've been to a different Babbo several times and always ordered a calzone. Went to this one for the first time and tried a couple different things. For a Saturday night it was pretty dead. All the various servers were all very nice and were quick on refills and bringing to-go boxes. The food was so-so. Tried the Amy's lasagna and Mozza-balls. The lasagna was pretty bland and had enough sauce to choke a mule. They seem to like covering everything in way more sauce than it needs, but if you're into that I guess it's good. The Mozza-balls were really good, and I would order those again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Surprise's hidden gem. If you love the authenticity of Italian food, this is the place to go. The ambiance, is awesome, the wait less than you'd expect. The flavor? Out of this world. Amazing use of spices, sauces, pasta's, veggies  and meat. I was shocked literally. The food is just so good, we are still talking about our Sunday evening meal. 3 pasta's and desert you're looking to spend a little more, but the freshness is so worth it. We are planning our next jaunt to Babbo and can't wait to explore the menu."}
{"text":"We love to ride our bike there and have dinner! It's an awesome place with amazing food and great service! We love the chopped wedge salad and the Buffalo chicken pasta! So good!"}
{"text":"Came here as a fluke looking for a new italian place. WOW I  sure glad we did. Wonderful service and even better food. One had garlic chicken pasta and the other a sicilian pizza... WONDERFUL!!! We will be back, perhaps tomarrow!!"}
{"text":"Service was way too slow and it wasn't that busy yesterday when we were there.  The bread was stale and the food was just ok.  Been there many times before but may have to skip this place and take off my list.  Would have given 4 stars the first time I went there a few years ago; however, it is getting progressively worse with each visit and yesterday's visit may have been the deal breaker of ever going back."}
{"text":"I saw the billboards for the spaghetti and meatball dinner for $5.99, and being a frugal bastard (A frugal bastard uses a coupon. A cheap bastard stiffs the waitress.) I thought that I would give it a try. 

I stopped in for a take-out order, and the place was packed. I ordered at the bar, and decided to start a game of chess on my phone, since I was going to be waiting for awhile. On my third move, and less than five minutes later, my order was ready. Wow! That was fast, especially with how busy this place was. 

I forfeited my game, and headed home with the goods. At the house I opened the bag to find a nice size bowl of spaghetti with two big meatballs, a couple good size pieces of bread, dipping oil, and parmigiana cheese. Not the best pasta I have ever had, but far from the worst, and better than some swanky, expensive restaurants. For six bucko's and speedy service, it's a good deal. Real food for the price of Micky D's.

Update: On a recent visit I noticed that the \"Gun Free Zone\" sign was gone. These signs are like magnets for wackadoodle's who know that the place is an easy target. OK, I'm changing from four stars to five!"}
{"text":"Reserved table for a birthday party of 10.
Pros:  
1.  Table was ready when we arrived and they offered to seat us as we arrived instead of making us wait until everyone had arrived.
2.  They brought a complimentary birthday dessert big enough for the whole table to share, with doughnut holes on the bottom, topped with ice cream and whipped cream on top.

Questionable:
The service.  Repeatedly, would ask the server for something.  He would leave, return to the table several minutes later with something else, leave again, and just when you started to wonder if he had forgotten what you'd asked for, he would return with it.  This happened 3 or 4 times, not just once.  On the up side, our drinks glasses were always filled.

Cons:
I'm sorry, but it was the food!  I'd eaten here before and enjoyed it.  This time, not so much.  I did order a selection of bruschettas for the table, and those were good, for the most part.  But my main course, the \"Amy's Lasagna\" (billed as taking a little longer but worth it) and a strip along 1 side that was about an inch wide that was inedibly hard and in some places out-and-out burned that I had to cut away with a knife.  Also, what remained was incredibly salty (written by someone who probably uses more salt than I should).  If you're doing that to one of your highlighted dishes, I can't imagine what you're doing to the others.  Also, the guest of honor said his fettucchini alfredo main course tasted \"different.\"

If I were going to go back, I certainly wouldn't order either of those things, but at this juncture, I'm not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"Have only gotten takeout previously and wish I had stuck with that. It's always been convenient, on my husband's way home from work for days I run out of time to cook. But last night we stopped in for dinner because of a coupon we received via email. Wish we hadn't! 

It wasn't extremely busy, several empty tables a little before 6 and we were seated right away. Asked for a booster seat for our toddler and was informed they didn't have any. Minus 1 star. Kid friendly to me suggests accommodating to children's needs. Most restaurants offer crayons and such. But not here. Luckily we do carry things with us for these just in case moments but not having a booster seat is just unheard of in a family restaurant! Oh and they don't offer any sort of juice for kids, or so we were told. Our waitress offered soda, milk or water. The only thing for kids here is a small section on the menu. I'm sorry but in my opinion not kid friendly.

We attempted to order an item listed on the coupon list but was informed they were out of it already! It wasn't even 6 and they ran out of one of their specials already?!? Minus another star. We ended up ordering two appetizers and two pizzas. 

Our server asked if we had a preference on order of items to come out and we said no. Thank goodness we didn't ask for appetizers first! Out came the firecrackers rolls with Misto salad on the side. They were good, but nothing to write home about. Deep fried, won ton wrapped items served with marinara sauce and a salad on the side. We don't order deep fried foods for takeout so this was a treat. Salad was overdressed and really wilted. Shortly thereafter both pizzas came out. Crust was good as always, SO much better fresh than for takeout! But the Bianca pizza didn't have any garlic on it as listed in the menu. We would have told our server but she seemed to have disappeared at this point, after having refilled our beverages. We saw her again when we were almost through with our meal and then oh yah! That stuffed portobello mushroom we ordered came out! Minus another star. It was OK. Thinly sliced spicy sausage intermingled in the sauce that drowned the mushroom and covered the plate. Way too much sauce for the small portobello that was interestingly bottom down on the plate. Guess I'm just used to a \"stuffed\" mushroom to have the cap upside down and literally stuffed rather than sauce poured over the top and topped with cheese.

We will go back again only because it's one of the few restaurants in the area that we've found to be convenient, have great salads when dressing is on the side and moderately priced for as often as I run out of time to cook during the week!"}
{"text":"Yum. This was our 1st time here. The waiter, Austin recommended the 3 cheese mac and cheese when I couldn't decide between 2 items. It was delicious and the fact that I ate it all is a testament to that. The sausage had a nice kick to it. I would like to try it baked.  My husband had the chicken/artichoke calzone. He said the artichokes were fresh and he was very happy with his choice.  Austin pointed out the calzone would take 15-20 minutes to bake and he'd make sure we would have bread to tide us over.  I thought that was nice of him to mention that it takes a bit longer than other items. Monday and Tuesday $6 spaghetti and meatballs special."}
{"text":"Great food, great price, great atmosphere and great service. I could not ask for more. I had the spaghetti and sausage, I really liked it. I returned for lunch and had a hot Italian sandwich. It was fantastic . Oh, the sauce for dipping bread is good too. I will be here more often. And, to boot, every server I've had has been very attentive. The last one, Noelle, was super nice and kept the bread coming and the cups full. No more Olive Garden for me."}
{"text":"This place is really mis managed, place packed staring at 3pm on Monday and Tuesday due to pasta special, and Every week they have many empty tables until 4:30 or so citing no servers to cover them...DA! get more in early and take the money, how incompetent can a business be??? Never again for me!! and I live here year round!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me about this place so I decided to bring my boyfriend out to dinner before catching a movie. I created a yelp account just to vent about our experience. To start, the drinks took about 15 minutes to get to the table. We ordered the bruschetta trio at the same time as our drinks which took about thirty minutes to get out. The bruschetta came out with our salads which we had ordered later than the bruschetta. Not only was the salad order wrong, 1/3 of the bruschetta order was also wrong. As noticed from the receipt, both of those mistakes were the server's mistakes, not the kitchen's. While the bruschetta wasn't bad, the salads were awful. The server asked about my salad and asked if I just didn't like it. I told her I didn't. It was bland and soggy. My boyfriend took one bite of his Caesar salad and said it was soggy as well. The server made no mention of his full salad off to the side. She just took it away. I'm shocked she didn't have a manager come by and touch the table. Terrible experience and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Main points:
-Pretty good Italian food with different menu options than your corner Olive Garden
-Extremely great service
-Nice dining room, good for groups or date
-Great tasting offered for weddings

Review:
I just came back from a food tasting for upcoming family nuptials, so I tasted A LOT of dishes.  This place definitely gets thumbs up for the array of food they let you taste when deciding for a wedding: 3 types of appetizers, 4 types of salads, 6 types of pasta, and 4 types of entrees.  The manager, Dustin, was so friendly and nice, he even threw in some delightful tiramisu.  I wish the food had been a little more in line with my taste because we had a wonderful service experience here. If I could, I'd give this place 3.5 stars.

However, after trying ALL that food, I would say it was just good. Sometimes at restaurants I find myself only loving two dishes and hating the rest; here, I liked several things but didn't love anything.  Also, am I the only one who doesn't like olives? A salad and a pasta I had tasted completely like olives which just tainted the whole dish for me.  Obviously personal preference there...they did have a good variety of salads, pasta, and entrees, I enjoyed all of the above that included gorgonzola...yum. 

Overall, great service,dining room, and decent food, so if you're looking for a cool yet casual place to grab a drink or have a meal and you love Italian food, you may enjoy Babbo's."}
{"text":"See below for my first review. We keep coming back because the food is really amazing. We try a new dish each time and are continually amazed. The service has been amazing so I am eating my words from my first review. I've changed my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars. They are my favorite, local restaurant.

\"A friend suggested we try this for Tuesday because they have a special on spaghetti and meatballs. The place is lovely and the service is great. We were seated and we were quickly greeted and offered drinks and bread. We decided on the Tuesday night spaghetti and meatball dinner. After our server left, we had another server who had a male friend who appeared to be her boyfriend, hanging over our booth having a conversation. We listened and watched and even took a photo. Ugh. And, the next table was having a great time laughing hysterically. While I'm glad they had a great time, I wasn't enjoying participating in it. The place is very noisy and needs some acoustics to absorb the sound of nearby people. Bottom line: great food, great service, but the atmosphere is lacking.\""}

{"text":"Lovely little local joint in Surprise, with a quaint atmosphere, excellent service (thanks Alex!), and superb food!  Wholly recommend this fabulous eatery! 

Spicy Alfredo Italian Sausage Pasta w/ an added Meatball: the pasta was perfectly al dente, the meatball was a bit \"tight\" (it should have fallen apart, but was a bit too firm), and the sauce was just enough spicy for a good zing... the only downer was the sauce-to-pasta ratio was off: too much sauce, not enough pasta. Still superb! 

Creamy Garlic Chicken Pasta: the pasta (again) was perfectly al dente, the chicken was moist and delicious, and the sauce was rich and creamy, with just enough garlic to make it pop.  Again the only downer was the sauce-to-pasta ratio was off: too much sauce, not enough pasta. Still delightful!

Bread: so many yelp reviews show the bread being the best thing on the menu, and while my fella thought the bread was out of this world, I just felt that it was mediocre at best.  

The Big Baked Babbo Pizza Cookie (chocolate chip): the flavor was divine; however, it wasn't cooked all the way through. Now, some folk enjoy that gooey cookie flavor, and while I do enjoy gooeyness, this was a bit much. There was just a bit too much cookie that was only half-cooked."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, garlic artichoke roasted chicken with capers and lemon.  It's one of the chalkboard menu items where you pick your choice of side salad, entree and preparation method.  Mikala, our server, was very helpful and ensured we enjoyed our meal or needed anything during our dinner.  I'm so happy this isn't another national chain 'ragu in the bottle' type Italian restaurants.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Gets worse and worse every week. Was a great restaurant five six years ago. Now it's a pathetic excuse for a meal. Brutally honest sorry. Calzones always under cooked. Food never what you ordered. They don't give you a lot of bread to go like they used to. They don't even cut the firecracker rolls on half for you anymore. Disappointing"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite restaurant.
My husband and I come from South Scottsdale to eat here.
Last couple of times the service has been awful and the food not good. This time I had to send my salad back because the Brussel sprouts were raw. We didn't get a refill on our iced tea and honestly, not even sure who our server was. Worst service ever.
We will not be back. Such a shame. Hope management pays attention."}
{"text":"I have NEVER had a bad meal here at Babbos. I enjoy their pizza with goat cheese and mushrooms (minus the peppers-they don't like me),  the pasta, and especially the crab dip appetizer. My husband has an almost unhealthy addiction to the  bread and herb/olive oil mixture but I can live with that. Service is good. Prices are reasonable, portions are large."}
{"text":"First time and we will definitely be back! Great service and they offered us a trial kitchen menu. Killer food, the pasta was perfectly cooked.

Looking forward to another visit!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!

I came here expecting an Olive Garden experience, which is to say I was not expecting much. I am happy to report that I really enjoyed the two times I have been. I would recommend this place to a friend and will definitely dine here again.

Pros:
Fast, friendly, helpful service
Great bread
Reasonable prices
Wide selection of appetizers & entrees
Full bar
Very clean

Cons:
No lasagna! (or other baked dishes)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had a great experience!

I'd been curious to check this place out after it opened, and upon walking in the building is very nice. I like the decor, it's modern but not trying too hard. We were promptly greeted at the front by a super nice guy who let us select a booth or table.

Our waitress greeted us soon after to take our drink orders. She was extremely attentive, brought us more bread and to go containers as soon as we could even think to ask for them!

The bread they bring out is delicious. I could probably eat it for my entire meal. They have lunch combos for $10.50 where you can get either a pizza or pasta and salad, and on Monday's and Tuesdays they have $6.99 spaghetti and meatballs all day. 

I opted for the spaghetti deal and we also got the cheese pizza and pomodoro tomato salad (tomato and mozzarella). 

The spaghetti was a huge portion with two meatballs. I liked the sauce, thought the pasta was cooked perfectly and enjoyed the meatballs.. and I'm not a huge pasta fan. The \"salad\" was tasty and fresh, and the pizza was decent. 

I'd definitely recommend coming here for lunch, it's got a nice vibe. The menu looked quite extensive so I will likely return to check out their dinner offerings!"}
{"text":"I saw this place being built and was excited to try it out once it opened! It has no became my go to lunch spot. The service is always spot on, friendly and the decor is casual but trendy. Prices are fair and the food is delicious. They're only local here in AZ and I told one of my waiters that they should open up a place back home in CA since they're always so busy when I stop in. My favorite dish here is the Mista salad, fresh, not swimming in salad dressing, just light, crisp and flavorful with lots of vegetables. I really enjoy coming here for lunch during the week."}
{"text":"It's been a couple of weeks since we went here, but last time the wait staff was slow as hell, forgot to bring order items and half our food was cold because they let it sit up there until the rest of the order was ready. Additionally I ordered marinara sauce with my spaghetti and I was under the impression it was just a simple tomato sauce, apparently they use the base of what's cooked off from their meatballs (which are beef and pork) I'm allergic to pork so while eating it I realized my stomach was starting to hurt really bad so I ended up going to the bathroom and was sick for an hour and half in there before leaving and I was still in severe stomach pains for like 2 days after that. I told the waitress I was allergic to pork too because I asked her what was in the meat sauce/ meatballs and I said I needed to have the regular marinara sauce. So needless to say I won't be back. I can't the risk of having an allergic reaction again to the stupidity of the wait staff"}
{"text":"Sauce. Love their tomato sauce! Mondays and Tuesday 5.99 specials are the best.  Everything I have tried there is great. Someone recommended this place to me and man I'm glad they did. Love it. 

The only thing they could improve would be the ambience."}
{"text":"Place is alright. I like how they give you olive oil / vinegar with bread when sitting down to eat here. The pizza is good but the selection for salads should be bigger."}
{"text":"My wife came here on a business meeting the other day and really liked it. So we tried it for dinner last night. I'm gonna be short and to the point as I'm ready for said wife to finish getting ready...

Manager greeted us at the door looking like he was pissed off. He slammed our menus down on the table, muttered something and walked to the kitchen. Then he went back to the bar and watched UofA lose. Dunno if he had money on the game, but it was quite obvious who he was pulling for.

Save for the MOD at the bar with five others, and two two-tops, this place was empty. On Saturday night. At 7:30. 

Server was great. Wife's miska salad was really good. My pasta dish was super salty, the cream not reduced at all, the tomatoes mush and the chicken was rubbery and gross. Wife's dish was better. 

I would go back for lunch or maybe order a salad, but I was absolutely not impressed."}
{"text":"Friendly and on point service at this location.  Pasta is fresh and comes to you steaming hot. Tuesday will be busy as it the Spaghetti Meatball special that brings in the crowds. My favorite dish is the Spicy Fettuccine with Sausage and Mista Salad."}
{"text":"I really can't say enough about this place. Food is fantastic and the service is spot on. I have been to a couple of the locations. Surprise and in Glendale.  Both are great. You have to try the 3 cheese mac and cheese"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience here! The food was SO delicious and our service was excellent too. I got a Turkey sandwich with Zucca Chips that was full of flavor and very well sized. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is probably a nice place but the service is incredibly slow.  The order was delivered after waiting 30 minutes from the order time. Unfortunately we had to send it back to the kitchen. They failed to deliver the meals as we requested. This restaurant is not vegan/vegetarian friendly.   Been sitting at the table for 1 hour now...no dinner.  Sad, this place has potential"}
{"text":"Read the good reviews on yelp and decided to try it out on a Sunday afternoon. The service was very lacking but it looked like they were short staffed. The food though was pretty uneventful. I had the Chicken Limone and my boyfriend had the Creamy Garlic Chicken. There was nothing going on with the food. No seasoning, no anything. Everything was very bland. Looked like it had been sitting in the back a while before the servers got it out to us. The appetizer we had (firecracker rolls) were lukewarm. Was so excited to try and sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"Do not miss this incredible Italian bistro! Monday and Tuesday for $5.99 you get a huge plate of spaghetti w two big met balls and fresh warm bread with olive oil and balsamic dipping sauce. We had an incredible time in this busy but very pleasant restaurant. Lots of locals order on line and pick up during the summer.
The staff is well trained and focused...a pleasure to witness. If you go once I guarantee you will be a regular!
Bon appetito!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Italian food, but I was craving pasta and pesto and my daughter wanted mac n'cheese.  I'd driven by Babbo many times so figured we'd try it.  Home run!  The bread they bring to the table was fabulous!  Nice start.  The staff was very nice and quick.  My daughter loved her mac n'cheese and I had a tasty steak and pesto dish.  The noodles were a little al dente - and I'm a mushy pasta girl.  The steak was tasty, the pesto was quite good and I had adequate garlic breath when I left!

I will go back to try something else there - their menu was quite large and had some interesting appetizers and dishes.  And their wine list looked nice too!"}
{"text":"Management is inept, appears inexperienced , and is completely unfocused on delivering an excellent customer experience.  Service is uneven although friendly. Food is first rate for price, quality and ambiance. Lose the manager, hire experienced wait staff and this will be 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place is awesome... have been to other locations around the valley and always consistent... keeps getting better each time.  Really good high quality food, reasonable portions and prices... great for a date, take-out, family night or catering.  Way to go... much needed in this little corner of the Tempe/Chandler area... thanks!"}
{"text":"I love Babbo's in Surprise. It's a great place for lunch, great prices. I love their pizza but the pasta is usually so-so. Friendly staff and we rarely have to wait long."}
{"text":"My wife and her friends have decided on a \"babysitting club\" type arrangement.  2 of the moms would watch the 3 boys while the other mom is free to do whatever she needs to do.  Today it was my wifes turn to drop off our son and have the afternoon free.  She had wanted to try this place out for quite sometime and today was as good as ever to head on down.

We arrived and were asked where we wanted to be seated.  We chose a booth.  They are really big booths here and very comfortable.  There were only 3 other people in the restaurant when we arrived.  They were seated at an angle to the booth we were in so that all 3 were kind of facing our booth.  It was a bit uncomfortable for a little bit because you could feel their eyes on you.  Not like they were doing it on purpose, just that the tables were set up so that they faced our booth every time they looked up.  Anyways..............  Our waitress came over and we ordered our drinks.  I got a water and my wife got a cherry Coke.   She dropped those off and took our order.  I went with a 12\" Meatball and Garlic Pizza and my wife went with the Spinach Gogonzola Pasta and she added chicken (Extra $4.25) .  After we placed our order, our waitress brought over a plate of complimentary focaccia bread which was paired with a shallow dish of olive oil/vinegar.  Here is how the food was..................

Complimentary Focaccia Bread-  Delicious!  It was a great start to the meal.  Some pieces had some red onion baked in.  It tasted great dipped in the oil.  We had 2 plates full of this stuff.

Meatball and Garlic Pizza ($12.95)-  This was a 12\" white pizza.  Olive oil base, topped with mozzarella, gouda, and fontina cheeses.  It also had tons of garlic and basil on it.  Each of the 6 slices had a piece of meatball on it too.  The meatballs were very tasty.  They were sliced thin, cooked perfect and tasted great.  The cheeses were good and the garlic provided a punch.  Sadly, this was all laid on top of a bland, tasteless crust.  The crust was cooked nicely and had a decent texture to it but it had absolutely NO flavor at all.  When I say no flavor, I mean no flavor.  No salt, yeast, sugar...nothing.  It was the most plain tasting pizza crust I think I have ever encountered.  Damn shame too...if there was any bit of flavor in the crust, this pizza wouldn't have been too bad.  I ate the whole thing because it's a sin to waste pizza ;-)  But I don't think I would come here and order a pizza again.

Spinach Gorgonzola Pasta ($14.75 after the addition of chicken)-  This was actually pretty tasty.  The sauce was incredibly heavy though.  It was almost like a bowl of soup with noodles in it.  My wife could only finish about half of it so I tried to finish the rest.  The noodles, chicken, spinach and tomatoes were really good.  That sauce was just way too overwhelming though and there was way too much of it.  If you order this dish, I would recommend to ask for about half the amount of sauce.

Service was friendly and thorough.  We had a coupon that we got in the mail the other day which was buy one, get one entree 50% off.  That saved us almost $7.00 right there.  After tax and tip, $32.00 and we were out the door.  Would I come back?  Yeah.  I would stay away from the pizza, and get a pasta dish with half the sauce.  It's a cool local place near our house and the prices are decent.  I'm not racing to come back, but if somebody wanted to come here, I could/would eat here again."}
{"text":"We were visiting and gave it a try.  Excellent food.  Excellent service.  I had the chicken parmigiana pasta.  Loved it.  Wife had Brussel Sprout pasta and she said it was \"so good.\"  The toasted ravioli, crab cheese artichoke dip, and 2 giant fried mozzarella balls are all delicious appetizers."}
{"text":"Just went to their new location in scottsdale and I was pleasantly surprised at the interior of this new build.  Modern but not stuffy.  Friendly staff and great food.  I really like their space planning in the dinning rooms, I didn't feel like I was crowded up to another table."}
{"text":"Never been a fan! From bad service, bad hostess, telling people 30 mins for takeout and taking over an hour, to getting food poising from their pizza. Food is not bad and that's why I went back a few times. They just suck at the small stuff!"}
{"text":"I've been to Babbo's several times.  I like the bread they bring out with olive oil and vinegar.  The red onions on it are good.

I usually get the Pasta Martini.  It has creamy marinara, chicken, artichokes, garlic, kalamata olives on penne.  
The Steak Panino is also good, but I've stopped eating red meat.

My friend had the toasted ravioli, and the sausage was too spicy for her, but she's not into spicy foods.

We tried their Apple Calzone dessert.  It was fair to good.  Portion was huge, and I liked the whipped cream and vanilla ice cream, but I thought the apples tasted canned/blah and the fried calzone dough didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"Just ordered lunch to go and OMG! The gentlemen who I spoke to on the phone (I called twice) were very helpful and polite. I had the lunch special Pasta Puglia which was a delicious combination of spicy sausage, whole mozzarella and tomatoes in an olive oil based sauce! Bravo! The side caesar was fresh and the kicker was the foccaccia bread with olive oil/balsamic dipping sauce. IN A TOGO ORDER! Very nice touch. I will definitely be back to eat in!"}
{"text":"Love this!  What a deal on Monday and Tuesday night! A big plate of spaghetti and two huge and juicy meatballs for $5.99. Cheap and delicious. We go there at least 2 times month!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to dine in surprise. Good food, friendly staff, and decent prices. I like the atmosphere and sitting on the patio to dine is my favorite spot. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick italian food hang out! great drink selection and their bread is sinfully yummy!"}
{"text":"Someone told me about this place and their all you can eat spaghetti. They also mentioned that they have great meatballs...so I had to check it out myself. 
The first thing that bothered me was the noise level...it's like all the conversations going on in this place remained within the walls. However, the staff was very friendly and the service was good. 
I had the Artichoke, Shrimp & Crab Dip which was good, but I wish it had more chucks of crab. I obviously tried their spaghetti with meatballs which I thought was good, but not  the best I've had. The sauce was a bit to watery for me and the meatballs just didn't have that \"wow\" factor, but it was good (just not the best). I had also ordered a customize Calzone and that was without a doubt fabulous! The size and flavor were definitely in the \"wow\" factor. This helped to push the rating to a 4 star plus the service."}
{"text":"Babbo's is our favorite Italian restaurant.  The Brussels Sprout/Beet  salad is delicious.  Also love the Pasta Valducci.  The Tiramisu is the perfect finish to the meal."}
{"text":"Place was swamped with Luke days, spring breakers,  and spring training fans, had a nice chicken Alfredo with mushrooms and sundried tomatoes, good pasta primavera, and huge calzone with chicken, mozzarella, spinach and tomato."}
{"text":"We hired Babbo's for our wedding catering so this review applies to that and our tasting!
We were paired with Dustin who gave us a wonderful tasting at this location and we LOVED the food so we decided to book with them.
He stayed in constant contact with me and answered my millions of questions in a very timely manner.
We fed 200 people at my wedding and I had people tell me afterwards and ask where it was from because they loved it so much. They said it was flavorful and we had a great variety for our guests.
If you are looking for wedding catering or even just dinner, this place is the bees knees. Loved it and will be back just as a regular guest!
Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I've written enough about the Spag special and the Brussel Sprout salad which is what we had again this time. It was all fabulous but what was different this time was our server. We usually sit in Rudy's section but he was off tonight. Our server was Lauren. OK, we've had a few servers here and they have ALL been exceptional at their jobs. Lauren was great. K thought she looked like some actress from a Hallmark Christmas movie. Regardless;
Great service, Great food, Great Value, clean facility. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Food soooo good ! Beyond excellent service.. Everything was flavorful, including pizza! Firecracker app was to die for !"}
{"text":"Just ate at the new Surprise location for the first time.  As other reviewers have said, it is a very nice upgrade from the prior location.  Overall, we like Babbo and have gone several times, but this time I had a sandwich and I need to write about it.

The \"Italiano\" sandwich is a mess.  It is a variation on a standard Italian sub (i.e., similar ingredients) but the chef is trying waaaaay too hard to make it unique.  It is on focaccia bread, which in itself isn't a bad thing, but the bread was not cut entirely in half, i.e., it wasn't two slices, one on top of the other.  Instead, it was partially cut open like a submarine sandwich roll, and then stuffed with an architecturally unstable combination of ingredients,  The result is that everything just falls out of the sandwich.  It is a mess to try to eat.

As to the ingredients, they are okay, except for the random globs of tasteless mozzarella cheese.  It added nothing to the flavor and kept just falling out onto the plate.  Also, the lettuce was in big chunks, so it made the sandwich ingredients taller, but once again made it harder to eat.

So, we still like Babbo, but I won't be ordering that sandwich again.  You should skip it, too, unless you like a challenge."}
{"text":"I LOVE coming here! I even had Babbo cater my wedding it's that wonderful! Ann is the best waitress Ever she totally will spoil you! The pesto is the best-o!!  Chocolate cheesecake was to die for! I recommend coming here every time you want to go out to dinner!"}
{"text":"I went to Babbo's on a lunch break. I have seen the advertisement for the 5.99 spagehetti and meatballs. I went with a coworker, we both ordered the special and with my foursquare check in I received free garlic hummus spread. The meal also came with complimentary bread and olive oil. The bread was tasty and so was the garlic spread, it was a huge portion, so i was able to take the rest to go. The Spaghtti comes in good size bowl with two HUGE meatballs. At first I didnt think the sauce was too tasty but once I got home and ate the rest it was delicious. I only ate half of the pasta and one meatball, i took the rest home. Very good deal for 5.99. The meatballs had great flavor and were very juicy. I would love to have a sandwhich with them, very good. I will be returning since a good special and close to work"}
{"text":"Bomb food! I order ten Cajun fettuccine and it was excellent. It definitely had a kick to it but was perfect for my liking. The crab dip appetizer was amazing!
It was busy during the lunch hour but the service was still great. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"We discovered Babbo Italian Eatery when some friends suggested it for a dinner. Not being an a fan of Italian cuisine I reluctantly agreed, and I am glad I did. The service was incredible and food spot on. I ordered the Alfredo Supremo with shrimp, I have never tasted Alfredo sauce that magnificent!!! We ordered a pizza the next visit, and it has now become a Friday night tradition."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant multiple times and every time I go I am amazed just how great the service and food is. Their bread appetizer is phenomenal! The restaurants ambiance is perfect for all ages. If you are looking for a place to take your family for dinner I would highly recommend Babbo Italian Eatery."}
{"text":"Babbo's, a family-owned restaurant chain, recently opened this new location down the street from where they had another location.  This newly-built location is beautiful, modern, feels much larger than the old location, and has much greater visibility from Bell Road.

And the food... is still just as good as ever!  I previously had the Sicilian pizza (multiple times) and Caesar salad, and this time ordered a calzone.  I chose to build my own calzone and added sausage, mushroom, and fresh tomatoes as fillings.  All calzones come stuffed with mozzarella and ricotta cheese as well... and come with a big bowl of some of the best marinara sauce I've ever had in a while!

The service here is almost always spot-on and quick to take orders, fill up your drinks, get you containers for your leftovers, and take care of your bill.  

Whether you're looking for a (fairly) quick lunch stop or a nice(r) place to bring the family for dinner, Babbo's is it!  

I am definitely a fan and will continue to frequent this location.

*****FIVE STARS*****"}
{"text":"I'm having such a hard time reviewing this place...I normally have a pretty good experience and the food is usually pretty good, but this last time, I had bad food and bad service.

I had the italian sausage pasta which is normally salty so I asked for less salt.  I was sharing it with someone who can't eat peppers so I asked for it on the side.  My dish was flavored right but the peppers weren't on the side.

My roommate ordered the spaghetti and meatball special but with less sauce.  The spaghetti was smothered in sauce, when we asked about it, the waitress quickly said there's normally even more sauce...hard to believe.  The pasta was way over done too.

The one constant is the bread...they have really good bread...very unique in comparison to the bread at other italian restaurants.

It was a less than superb outing this time.  I'll eventually go back to try it again but I don't know if I can justify the drive if the experience is bad again."}
{"text":"The secret is to go early. This is a very popular local restaurant with good food, excellent prices, good service and friendly staff. We all had an excellent meal and can't wait to return to try the rest of the menu. I would recommend that you go early because this restaurant is so popular with the locals that it fills up fast."}
{"text":"So nice to enjoy a great lunch/ dinner in a fun atmosphere and friendly servers ( thanks Anne)!!
Love the Monday and Tuesday spaghetti and meatball special..hard to beat!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good food.   Perhaps one of the better Italian restaurants I ate at.   I noticed that others commented on the temperature being cold.  I would agree."}
{"text":"I remember going there to eat a short while back. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and was not disappointed in the least. The portion was generous and the price was reasonable. The waiter was courteous and friendly. The food was delicious."}
{"text":"Babbo's here is Far East Mesa opened on Monday. With that being said - we arrived tonight around 6:00 to a packed house!

We were seated promptly and our waiter arrived within a few minutes for drink orders. The wine and alcohol list was long. We settled for sodas and tea. 

We were than brought a basket if bread with oil and balsamic. Wonderful, warm and fresh.

The kids and I ordered the traditional cheese pizza. The pizza was not greasy or over cooked. The sauce was flavorful but not too rich. 

Hubby had chicken fettuccine and the portion was large. See photos. He said it was one of the best he has had. 

Bathrooms were very nice and seemed well kept.

The only thing I saw that will need some work is keeping an eye on drinks (refills) when they are very busy. The manager walked by and realized 3 out of 4 drinks were empty and quickly filled them. 

Overall we will be back! I really enjoyed the dinner and service was good. Hoping they have a successful business and around a long time."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite!! I would eat here everyday if I could! Lol love love love it!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in looking for something quick, sat at the bar was served immediately, friendly waiter. Had a smoked turkey sandwich, it was huge an as an added bonus received some bread to eat while I was waiting. Good service, great food and very economical for what I had. I will be back"}
{"text":"Was looking for a Italian place that gives good food at a reasonable price. This place hit their mark with a very nice atmosphere, good food and excellent service. The atmosphere was clean and looked nice. The food was good except for the pizza which tasted great. The employees are quick and are very kind to the customers. Very good find and I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"This is the number one spot for a Spaghetti and Meatball fix. They serve piping hot chibatta bread when you are seated. Everything is beautifully done. Did I mention the Spaghetti and Meatballs....that is only $6.99 all day Monday and Tuesday!!"}
{"text":"This place kind of rocks a whole lot. They give you as much free delicious and warm bread as you want with balsamic. My brother had them cater his wedding and the food was quite good. I went there last night for my mom's birthday and the food was equally good. I got the pasta rustico and it was tasty, but would benefit from some basil or something. The BF had the turkey sandwich and it tasted very fresh which was good. My mom had the chicken in creamy garlic sauce with pesto added and it was delicious! So rich, but so tasty. Everyone enjoyed their food and the service was great. I'll definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"I recently rediscover Babbo. I didn't love it the first time, but after exhausting other local Italian restaurants in the area, I decided to give it another whirl. Tonight was my second visit in the past month. My first was good. Not great, not Yelp worthy. My second being tonight the service alone stood out to me. Our server Aiden was extremely friendly and eager to make sure my son and I were satisfied. Even while others stood around twiddling their thumbs, Aiden hustled and kept a genuine smile. The food was better than my last visit. Overall, if you order right and luck out with a great server it is a great local spot!"}
{"text":"I dropped in today to have a decent meal, tired of the bbq and burger joints in this area. Iwas so happy to find a clean and welcoming restaurant that was not blasting loud music. Instead, the music was hip but not\" bubble gummy\", smooth but not drowsy. This is important to me because ambienace and atmosphere help my dining experience. I want to enjoy my conversation and be relaxed. 
Anyway, the Manager greeted me and sat me promptly. The bar was quaint but enough. I didnt feel closed in. The wine list was more than I anticipated. Im no wine snob but there were several selections of Pinots, Reds, Chardannays etc... I had heard of from various Regions.
The Staff was attentive but not pushy. I started with an Arugula and White Bean salad, which was very good; tangy and sweet and ample sized for a salad. I then chose the Italian Sausage and Pasta; it was spicy without spoiling the other flavors in the dish of Bell peppers and spices and onions. The marinara sauce was perfectly balanced between chunky without being too soupy. 
I will definately return thanks to the very good service, the atmosphere,the variety of drinks and winer, the delicious menu and appetizers, and the potential for this being a regular spot for taking a date while in Arizona.
BTW, there is ample parking and access for all. Too bad the rest of the shopping center isn't as nicely kept as Babbo Eatery."}
{"text":"Great food is the foundation of any good restaurant, but so too is the staff and the ambience of the place. This restaurant has it all! 

Lori my waitress was very nice, offered suggestions when I asked & I settled for the spaghetti with meatballs. Not only did it come at great price but was delicious too! 

Their passion iced tea ice tea was bright and refreshing + I especially appreciated the general manager coming to each table to see if everybody was comfortable and enjoying their lunch - she added to the total culinary experience. 

My first visit was so positive it's now going to be my weekly lunch stop who knows perhaps biweekly!"}
{"text":"Very welcoming place!!!! Very organized and helpful servers as well as take out! Come about a couple times a week! Cannot stop!"}
{"text":"Came in for Mother's Day with a large party. They let us make a reservation the day before. Service was great, the food was even better. Everyone left fat and happy. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place was terrible.   Sloppy food.  The water is not purified and is straight out of the canal.  They serve there customers nasty unpurified chemical water.  If they cant even purify thete water just imagine how they prepare your food."}
{"text":"We ordered from here last week. Being new to Arizona & noticing all the peeps lined up outside waiting to get in we figured the food would b really awesome, but after bringing r food back home to eat & enjoy I about puked. The spaghetti & meatballs were worst than canned spaghetti & the price of $12 was a joke!!!!! We have a place called Bravo in Poplar Grove, Illinois which a great serving of spaghetti which there's so much u have to take home ur leftovers & it's only $5.99. Babbo's spaghetti had no taste to it & the price of $12!!!!! Lol!!!! Someone has to b smoking something really good to serve this to people!!!! Go to Bravo's in Illinois, it's worth the drive!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of our favorites since moving to the valley some 5 years ago.
Pasta plates are killers.  I always eat past the point where I am full just because the offerings are so darn good.
Yep! My stomach swells and I am sure death is near (I'm a man) and I swear I will save some of the plate the next time we go."}
{"text":"Spaghetti and meatballs.........delicious.
Bread that comes with olive oil and balsamic.........delicious.
cherry vanilla italian soda.........delicious.


Really good customer service. We requested a booth and the hostess cleaned the table off for us so we could sit where we wanted to. The waiter was on his game as well."}
{"text":"Babbo's is sort of hit or miss for me, as far as the food goes. It's my sister's absolute favorite, so I've eaten there more times than I can count. On some visits, it's only so-so, but I've ordered some dishes that have truly been awesome. The mushroom and roasted green bean pasta? A MUST!!

I love starting the meal with bread and oil and vinegar and the service is always good. I will continue to accompany my sister there with no complaints :)"}
{"text":"Had not eaten here in years and regret not doing so. Everything was excellent from the bread to the   alfredo supremo and bowl o bolgnese. Tiramisu was also excellent. Lastly, our server Eric did a fantastic job."}
{"text":"Had the chalkboard portobello mushroom with veggies and spinach gargonzola.....it was delicious. With the salad it was a perfect meal. Will definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"One of my hands down favorite places, and was actually was raving to the man who cashed my Togo order out, of how AMAZING this place is. If you are truly a Italian lover, this place is sooo cute, and tasty!
My favorite is by far the 'kids mac n cheese', the same thing as the 3 cheese adult plate, but without some spices and the meat, (I'm vegetarian). 
I have been going to babbos since the location on 67th & 101 opened up a few years ago. My mom was a waitress there for a couple months, and always brought home the fresh bread. 
Seriously amazing, and what makes it better is that it's was my current boyfriends favorite place to eat, even before we were together! Now our special date nights are always at Babbo's. 

To the owner, (blonde lady?), YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT. amazing food. thank you for this restaurant! i la la la looooove this place and all the locations. 

*only downside is the location in N. phx near cave creek is kind of a dud. Either it needs a few aesthetic pick me ups, or the staff really doesn't enjoy their job. doesn't render my feelings of the business overall, but just a tip/note, the staff really seemed annoyed customers would keep coming in about an hour before close, it wasn't even busy at all, and they all seemed young and wanting to do something else. i was a waitress for a couple years and that vibe is never what you want your table to feel. we still tipped great, just didn't really love the vibe compared to all the lovely ones around phoenix!"}
{"text":"Was there on July 28th, food was marginal, would probably be better if they tried serving food cooked all the way through. I had a calzone that was warm on the edges but the cheese in the middle was still solid and the meat was cold. My wife's ravioli was similar. My sons spaghetti was steaming hot, so he was the big winner.
Service was another issue that could have been just when we were there. There were only 2 servers working the entire floor and they were so busy that they could not give full attention to any one table.
I had lunch there about 6 months ago and it was pretty good, so perhaps it was a bad night."}
{"text":"We have been here many times and the wait period, just be prepared.  They tell everyone 20-30 mins wait but you may wait hour.  We left tonight after 30mins, watching two other groups leave before us.   We were next on list, just 2 of us, and they actually grabbed another couple!  We looked at list again and just handed them the buzzer, let them know we didn't appreciate it.  We will not go back!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC. Just wonderful. We went here on a weekday as a family of 6 - had reservations, but they more than able to accommodate us. The food was absolutely wonderful for the prices. The service - we had a lovely young gentleman who was extremely attentive and patient with my... erm... not so articulate mother. My one gripe was that our pizza that we ordered wasn't that great - I'd stick to the main dishes instead.  The brussel sprouts appetizer (and mushroom artichoke) were so delicious."}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant four stars (this has since changed) mostly based on what is available to eat in Apache junction. I have eaten here twice, the first time was shortly after the opening and the food was edible and service good. I had a chicken and artichoke calzone  which was nothing more than a glorified hot pocket. One of the people with me had a salad and paid I think three dollars extra for steak which was an excessive price considering the amount of meat she got. 
   The second time My girlfriend and I went,  We shared the macaroni and cheese along with a personal pizza. The Mac was good  flavor wise, but the price was way off the mark. I have no problem paying for food if the taste and portion are worth it. The Mac cost twelve dollars (maybe worth eight) and was a much less than filling portion. The mac is not worth it considering what it cost to make a bowl of macaroni and cheese with bacon and a few pieces of sautéed bread in it. I happily pay thirty dollars for a seven ounce steak at The Keg especially when I get a side and a salad with it. 
    The pizza was good and much better matched with its price. Bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar is served with your meal which is always good,ask for the garlic butter it is tasty. Like I said considering the restaurant options in AJ and the immediate area around Signal Butte this place gets four stars by default. The prices seem to be off and so far the food has been mediocre. I will continue to drive to Oregano's or Buca Di Beppo if I want good Italian food. 

I originally gave this place 4 stars by default but have been back since and the service has gone down hill. The three times I have been back were far less than satisfactory. Two of which were with Christie C you can read her review above and get the jest of our experience with Babbo.  Last night was probably the worst trip here, service wise. We waited outside for about forty minutes and when we went in to see why people that arrived after us were being seated before us. We were told they had called earlier and put there names on the list but had missed there times. But, since they had arrived they still had to be seated before us. That does not make any sense to me if you make an appointment and are late you lose your spot in line.  This place should pay more attention to what the locals have to say rather than giving so much attention to snowbirds as we are the customers that will keep this place going in the summer. I am not sure if I will be back to this place I have given it numerous chances. I really wanted Babbo to be a good place to eat since there is really nothing in AJ that is worth leaving the house for. But unfortunately the service has gotten worse instead of better with time."}
{"text":"Babbo is a pretty modern Italian eatery, the decor and setup make it very open and friendly. We only went in for a quick bite at lunch but we found it to be very enjoyable.  We just tried some pasta with cream sauce and had some of their bread. My husband always appreciates places that have good bread and dipping sauce and Babbo doesn't disappoint.  The oil and vinegar sauce goes really well with the bread they offer and makes for a great little taste as an appetizer. While we didn't get to try a whole lot on the menu the first time we will definitely be back to give it a try again!"}
{"text":"The food is good, reasonably price and the portions are big.  However, you need to manage the dining experience.  It is another Italian food restaurant where table turns seems the primary objective of the staff.  If you are not careful your appetizer, salad and entree will all arrive at the same time."}
{"text":"Took a shot on this place after seeing the billboard for years. It did not disappoint. I got the spaghetti and meatball plate which was delicious. They brought out warm bread, oil and vinegar as well. The service here was excellent (we did go during a slow time so not sure if that was a factor) and the server was very attentive. We will absolutely return to this place and it may become our new italian go to in Tempe. For the record, they have some great happy hour and specials on certain days."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food! My husband and I dined in on a Sunday night. The place was full but we didn't have to wait more than 3 minutes for a booth. Our server was friendly and attentive. The appetizer bread that comes free with the meal is amazing! We ate 2 plates of it. We also ordered the bruschetta trio which was really unique and delicious. One of a kind and fun to choose the flavors. I ordered the Quattro Formaggi pizza with mushrooms. It was perfectly thin and crispy. Definetely my favorite pizza I've had in a long time. My husband ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich. He loved the concept of it with the salad inside and the thick bread. He wasn't blown away by the standard buffalo sauce. We were too full for dessert because everything was so good! We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Nothing atvthis place is spectacular other then their bread. I have eaten at two different locations. Everything even salad dressing is overly salty."}
{"text":"I always love this place. And when we got the email for the special cheap spaghetti and meatballs tonight, we were there. It was insanely busy. We waited 20 mins when she said it would probably be a half an hour. Our service was fast, we didn't even have to ask for everything we needed. Our server was very attentive. He brought more bread without us asking for our son, and a spoon and an extra plate when the spaghetti arrived. I wish I could remember his name but nonetheless, great location. I only wish they would buy the building next to them. It's so small for how busy they seem to always be. Great staff, food was hot and not 'under a heater' hot. Will make our way here often on Mondays and Tuesday's on our way back from my mothers. Thanks for the good experience."}
{"text":"I went online to place a to go order. I arrived 15 minutes after I ordered. I paid my food and the supervisor did not even ask me if I have taken my food or not, all he did was just getting my money and then he left maybe he thought I have my food with me. Few minutes after that, a waiter came and told me the food is almost ready. Well it was not. I approached him 15 minutes after he said the food is almost ready and asked him if they have prepared my food before I came. He then asked the chef who apparently told him that the food was burned.  If that's the case, the manager did not even say sorry or do anything, i did not even see the manager. Oh BTW only 3 tables that were filled in the entire place, so it's not like they were busy or something. I sat there and waiting and waiting and after 45 minutes after I placed the order, I got my food. What does this tell me? 1. Manager does not care about customer yet in this economy business can survive if they have good customers based. A good restaurant I would imagine will be packed during the weekend, This place was never packed during the weekend. .2. The supervisor knew that I have been waiting for 30 minutes and yet did not say anything. 3. Just make me wonder if employee of this place even care about making this place a good restaurant/business? Food is just OK, nothing special. There are many other Italian restaurant out there that provides good food and customer service. By far the worst customer service I ever received in a restaurant. Try other place before you eat here. If employees do not care about their restaurant, I would wonder about the food too."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with a friend. And this just might be my new go-to Italian place. They have great menu selections at reasonable prices as well as a happy hour and lunch specials! The staff is friendly and fast my food came out in 10 min!"}
{"text":"Excited for the newest location to open and finally tried it out. Our initial 7 minutes was rocky...we were seated quickly, but no server came to the table until we inquired about ours with the hostess. 

Lots of menu options. The good news is our food arrived within 5 minutes of ordering (no exaggeration). Both entrees were good. Flat iron protein bowl and Brussels sprout/pancetta pasta, and the bread was GREAT!  

Good place to go for Italian fix. Nothing amazing but we will for sure go back."}
{"text":"Always fast and friendly service. They have a huge selection of your typical Italian favorites but with a yummy Babbo twist. Always very accommodating to everyone's pallet and lifestyle. Definitely worth checking out if it's your first time and worth returning for their new menu items that are added frequently."}
{"text":"Spaghetti with meatballs all around for this table. This hearty portion for only 6.99 each can't be beat."}
{"text":"I have not had Italian food this good in years! I ordered the Calzone and could not finish my meal, there is more than enough food! The restaurant was a bit small and cramped, but the food made up for it. We will definitely be returning and this will one of our choices for favorite Italian food!"}
{"text":"Blah. Based on Yelp recommendations, stopped in here the other night for a quick dinner.  Not impressed...

Service was okay, servers were friendly (perhaps overly so - we were asked maybe six or seven times if things were ok). But, the food was bland and overly cheesy (all three of us agreed), pedestrian at best.  Our server got one of our orders wrong, didn't bring silverware when we asked him to. 

Honestly, nothing special. Won't come back here again."}
{"text":"Good dinner. They have really good bread. I had the Alfredo with steak. Great Alfredo sauce and the skirt steak was tender and flavorful. On the other had, my wife had the sausage and pasta and she couldn't eat it. It was way too spicy hot. We both like spicy food but they went way overboard on this one."}
{"text":"I love the brussels sprouts and beet grilled salad with chicken, it's the best. Somewhat pricey though."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go. The waiters and waitresses are amazing. They demonstrate their happiness of working there by their demeanor and attention to the patrons' needs or requests. Our waitress tonight was Lexie. She doted over us and made good suggestions for our meal. We positively enjoyed our visit. I truly recommend a visit to Babbo's."}
{"text":"Always great friendly service and the food is always fresh and delicious. Bread is hot and my favorite"}
{"text":"First time trying out this Babbo location. We ordered our food Togo. They were out of one pasta dish we wanted so they comped us another pasta dish. That was a really nice gesture.

The spicy sausage and jambalaya pasta was tasty. Slightly on the greasy side and some of the noodles were clumped together but they were delicious seasoned perfectly.

The prosciutto & fig sandwich was delicious too. They use the same freshly baked bread they use for their breadbasket served with oil & vinegar. This sandwich would be good choice for lunch. I would pass on the zucchini chips though."}
{"text":"We went last night for the $6.99 Chicken Parm special.  It's a Thursday night and the \"deal\" was Wednesday & Thursday night only.  Arrived around 6 pm and told it would be 45 to 60 min wait.  We opted to wait because we have heard good things and this was a perfect deal to give it a try.  After about 45 min they made an announcement to all waiting outside...\"once seated you will be waiting another 60 min to get food because the kitchen is so backed up\".  Obviously people are disappointed.  Then we found out the $6.99 Chicken Parm deal was available for takeout orders as well.  What a bargain???  But stupid because most of the time when a restaurant offers a deal like that, it's \"dine in only\".  We opted to stay and wait, because at this point we might as well.  We were seated at about 60 min after arriving.  It took at least 10 min before the waiter came to take our order or bring drinks etc.  Not his fault because he was serving several tables and he was very nice and apologetic!  We ordered the 3 bruschetta appetizer which was VERY good.  Also, the Chicken Parm.  Of course it all came out at the same time.  The bruschetta was actually very good.  BUT the Chicken Parm was awful.  Chicken was dry and stringy.  Not sure if it was overcooked?    But we were so hungry at that point we just ate it and moved on.  We did order drinks and an appetizer.  So our $ 6.99 Chicken Parm turned into a $50 check plus tip, and our waiter was great so we tipped well.  Not sure if I would try it again.  I've heard such good things, but not our experience at all."}
{"text":"This is the second location of Babbo's I've been to, in comparison the service here is not as good. It's not bad service it's just slower and not as good as the one by my house. The food however is just as delicious and exactly how I expected, so that was really nice. We started with the Italian Firecracker Rolls which I had never had and I loved them, I thought it was a great selection of meats and a fun play on a egg roll.  I had the Roasted Brussel Sprouts and Pancetta pasta which is one of my favorites and it was amazing. Brussel Sprouts are one of my new favorite things this year and they are cooked just right for this pasta, plus there is very little cheese which I'm kind of avoiding for now. My friend had the Jambalya which he said was good.  The complimentary bread with oil and vinegar was as always delicious. It was a good experience, I just hope the service gets a little bit better in the future."}
{"text":"I am so glad this place is now close to Apache Junction! I absolutely adore the food. Everything I've had is delicious, I really love the pick 3 bruschetta option! The wait staff is always really nice too!"}
{"text":"Locally and family-owned since 2002.  Babbo is a clean and modern eatery with ample seating and a friendly wait staff.

* Firecracker Rolls, $9.95 - Topped with Parmesan, served with spicy marinara sauce, on top of a side of Mista Greens Salad:  We chose one of each offered flavors of Steak [steak, jalapenos, onions, provolone, and mozzarella], Italian [Italian meats, provolone, and mozzarella], and Buffalo Chicken [Buffalo chicken, mozzarella, and gorgonzola].  They were all pretty tasty and were a pretty substantial appetizer for two.  I really enjoyed the spicy marinara sauce that comes with it.

* Three Cheese Mac & Cheese, $14.95 - Smokey Chipotle cream sauce blended with cheddar, mozzarella, and gorgonzola.  Topped with bacon, sausage, croutons on penne pasta:  If you know me, you know I tend to eat like a 10 year-old because once I see \"mac & cheese\" on the menu, it's hard for me to see anything else I'd rather order.  They do their mac & cheese justice!  The smokey chipotle cream pairs well with the salty bacon and sausage.  Then the croutons bring on a nice crunchy element on top.  Penne pasta is also one of my favorite pasta shapes because it traps all the cheese inside.  YUM!

* Cajun Jamabalaya, $14.95 - Cajun chicken, spicy sausage, mixed peppers, mushroom, onions, roasted in a light garlic Cajun sauce.  Served on fettucine:  The Cajun jambalaya was tasty with a slow steady burn that intensifies the longer you eat it.  

* Dreamsicle, $4.25:  A play on Italian soda!  Nothing super extraordinary and I probably wouldn't feel the need to order this again.

All in all, this was a great dinner. I would love to come back to try their lunch specials! 3.5 stars easily."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good Italian food at reasonable prices.  Features spaghetti and meatballs for only 5.99 on Mondays and Tuesdays.  The sauce is superb which is the key to Italian food.  Extensive menu that includes amazing salads, pastas, calzones, and individual pizzas with hand tossed crust.  Great place to bring friends and family without spending a fortune.  Full bar and very nice house wine."}
{"text":"I'm baffled when I drive by Olive Garden and see tons of people waiting outside.  It's just pasta... overpriced pasta (I mean, how much can you charge for spaghetti) and it's not great food.    We really enjoy Babbo.  I like supporting local and family owned business PLUS they aren't just a spaghetti and meatballs kind of place.  They have many unique dishes.  I can make spaghetti at home - If I'm going out, I want the Asparagus and Mushroom Pasta and the Chipotle Pasta, etc.  Their roasted beet and brussel sprout salad is superb.  Good food.  Good prices.  Nice atmosphere.  Check it out if you haven't."}
{"text":"Just a great place.  Food is consistently spot on - no matter what you order.  Pastas, pizza, salad.  It's incredibly difficult to decide because everything really is 'that good!' You can't beat the prices either and the wait staff has always been great.  It's nice to know that no matter when you go or what you order, that you're going to have a pleasant meal.    Can't decide?  The roasted brussel sprout and beet salad is something that, once you have it, you'll CRAVE it!  The spicy green bean salad is pretty awesome too.  The Asparagus and Mushroom pasta, pizza, bread, rustica, chicken limone, ... all pretty darn good."}
{"text":"I am not a big Italian food kind of guy but my wifey is so I go with her. I have to say that the place looks great on the inside and the service is the same. I order the garlic chicken, cant complain. Great place I would definitely comeback. Try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We haven't had a bad dish. Atmosphere is perfect for a small Italian restaurant. I'd highly recommend it - great happy hour!"}
{"text":"Hate their advertising but their food is good and weekly special is a great deal. Happy hour as well.  First place after a decade in AZ I found somewhere that makes something like vodka sauce.  Great for fancier date night and family friendly.  Very nice wait staff.  Sometimes really fast service, and sometimes a long wait for the food (never for a table).  Large outside patio and bar seating as well."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to update my review for Babbo after a negative experience.  Seeing as how I don't make it up in that direction much, and I had to go up there today to run an errand, I was very excited about stopping at Babbo to pick up a salad for lunch.  I eagerly went to their website, picked out my perfect salad -- the Chicken Chopped Salad, which is new to their menu -- and placed my order.  I stopped by to pick up my salad, paid and came back to work.  To my dismay, once I opened up my salad, I noticed there were things in the salad that I didn't know came in the salad and that I don't eat -- like black olives and mushrooms.  Hmmm, I thought, did I make a mistake and order the wrong salad?  So I went back to their website only to learn that they actually gave me the WRONG salad!  Seriously????  I called the restaurant and the guy who helped me while I was there had already figured out his error and was apologetic for it.  He offered me a free salad the next time I come in, which is fine, even though I don't go there often.  However, considering he had my phone number from my online order, he could've at least tried to call me before I got all the way back to my office.

I had my mouth all ready for a good chopped salad and instead was given some crap I couldn't enjoy.  Although I was able to pick out most of the mushrooms, the salad I received was basically inedible for me, because there were so many black olives in it that it was hard to try to pick them all out.  

I'm so disappointed."}
{"text":"Things seem to have gone downhill. Ordered the chopped wedge, which might as well have called  bacon with a side of lettuce. Bacon was very fatty. I had removed it all and barely touched the rest of the salad. Waitress never even asked if there was an issue. My drink sat empty for the last half of my meal. Again, waitress never asked if I'd like a refill. Best thing about the meal was the starter bread."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty italian food... interesting pizza flavors (good, though!)... HUGE sandwiches... tasty salads!  The service is pretty good - a little slow when they are crowded.  Good for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We gave this place a 2 trys today was the 2nd time. Last time food was amazing but our meal had a huge dark hair in it and I'm blonde. We did not notice till the end so we just said yea that sucks but whatever. Then I wanted to try again with my wife. And she was a little worried but we said let's try again. We told the waiter very nice like hey just so you know last time this happened and it sucked so we are just saying we are givin this place another try let's make sure it's a good one to him. He laughed said well we have all blondes today like you so don't worry about it. It was funny. Then half way through my meal I have a huge spoon in my food they brought and put into the food and it was dirty with food still on it old sauce and this was jumbalia. So we told him hey look now this. This is not a good start. He said at least it's on the handle well it's dirty and in my food with my food all over the actual spoon part how do you know the other part was clean? We let it go and just said we won't eat here again. He did not take anything like a discount or any thing. Do you have to bitch to get something as a discount for 2 issues with our food with 2 huge issues of cleansing."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Italian foods and Babbo knocks IT out of the park! The server did a great job. Highly recommend the pesto bruschetta. Chris the manager was very welcoming and you could tell he wanted all of his customers to receive excellent service.  We will be returning again most definitely!"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed by this restaurant. I've had calzones and pizza, and it's all been amazing every time. I came here with my entire family to celebrate my birthday, and not only was everyone really happy with what they ordered, I was also given a free slice of the best chocolate torte I've ever had.

The complimentary bread + olive oil and balsamic vinegar is SO good, and the wait staff has always been very friendly, and this place is just really great. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Babbo Italian Eatery is a cute little Italian restaurant. The restaurant itself looked modern and cozy. The service was awesome. Our waiter checked up on us numerous of times and was very friendly. Now for the food, OMG what can I say. I love Italian food and love pasta. I could eat any type of past for one week straight! It was my very first time eating here, I was really hungry and didn't know what was good on the menu. I decided to play it safe and order the \"Alfredo Supremo\" which was a white wine, garlic cream alfredo sauce over a bed of linguine with chicken. It was filled with flavor and was yummy to my tummy! The bread that's served as a complimentary appetizer was awesome as well. I really recommend eating at Babbo's if your in the mood for tasty pasta dishes!"}
{"text":"Babbo is an amazing Italian restaurant.  The food is fresh and delicious. The manager Chris is very friendly. The staff is attentive and knowledgable. The restaurant was very clean. The overall atmosphere was very welcoming and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Good food, tasty.
Great bread, garlic spread and garlic butter.
Ordered pasta rustica with a meatball.  Tons of cheese, meatball very tasty.
No mistakes on carry out order.

Onky negatice is waiting 10 minutes for bread but it was worth it."}
{"text":"So, after sitting for 15 minutes, our waiter came and told us he forgot about us. I hope the wait was worth it! And, the restaurant wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Consistently horrible service.  Food is very good.

I used to shun corporate chains and opt for local offerings, but Babbo changed my mind.  They seem to hire servers who have little to no experience as servers, and frankly have no idea how to provide good service at all.

Just order it to go and you'll avoid this restaurant's downfall."}
{"text":"Service is no better than the Glendale location.  It's as if they're completely opposed to a training program that works so well for many of the corporate chains with much better service.  Sorry, but your food isn't THAT good to make us endure the untrained teenager service experience.

Food is quite good though, especially the personal sized pizzas and the complimentary bread (for dine-in).  

Parking is good."}
{"text":"This little place is great for a quick work lunch.  You get in, you get great food, you go back to work full but ready to finish the 2nd half of your day.  The salads are HUGE and last time I went, I split the regular sized salad with my friend & we shared the tiramisu for dessert.

My faves:
Mandarin spinach salad--tons of spinach, mandarin oranges, tossed with a light dressing
Steak and blue salad--loaded with thinly cut steak, walnuts & blue cheese
Quattro formaggi pizza--4 diff cheeses, thin crust, & excellent re-heated
Steak panino sandwich--tons of thinly sliced steak, bell peppers, onion, on their signature focaccia, served as an open faced sandwich.  

Tiny but decent bar, good wait staff, quick service (even for groups), and reasonably priced food!"}
{"text":"There is something in the menu for everyone!

My pasta was fantastic. I chose the Steak & Pesto Pasta, the flank stake was delicious and it complemented the pasta very well. Lots of pastas to choose from. The service was very attentive and the location is nice. The prices are very good too!

I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience. Lovely food/Lovely service.  It's pretty casual here also, which I appreciated.

The flavor profile of each dish was spot on, and the prices were exceptionally reasonable. One thing they do right: The meal is timed appropriately. I cannot abide food coming out at the same time, or shortly, after one's starter. Also, I didn't feel rushed at all, but when I needed to wrap the meal quickly, our server made accommodations.

The person who served us was a younger gentleman with glasses (if Management is interested in praising/promoting/training).

We started with the Garlic Hummus, which was VERY flavorful (don't plan on a full make out after this stuff).
I ordered the Portobello Mushroom with Brussel Sprouts from the \"Chalkboard\" Menu which also came with a nicely dressed salad of pine nuts, cheese and a sweet/tangy vinaigrette.
The Chocolate Torte was a LARGE portion, and very decadent. I also really enjoyed the cappuccino. Again, a large cup here - Enough for 2 to share.

41 dollars for 2 people - Which included 2 entrees, the app, dessert and coffee. Not bad at all.

I will definitely be coming back. I noticed some of the more negative reviews come from those that \"take out\" food...so I have no input there. Maybe go into the restaurant, sit down, and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Italian eateries in the West Valley. Great customer service! Our first visit had some hiccups with service but they went above and beyond to make things right. We have been coming back ever since. I would highly recommend the calzones; its one of my personal favorites."}
{"text":"I don't normally like Italian, but this place came highly recommended. It was amazing. I love the bread and dip too. Service was kind of shotty on Valentine's Day, but what can you expect when everyone and their mother goes out to eat in the same day. The calzone was amazing and the staff is super friendly too.  I'll be dreaming of this place tonight for sure."}
{"text":"I got here my family was already here ready to celebrate my nieces 1st birthday celebration. It took several minutes to place our order (almost 45) . My one niece had already finished her drink beforehand e the order was placed and it sat empty until we asked even after our meal was out. We did see the gentleman with spiked hair  I guess he was a manager behind the computer at one point then at the bar when we left. That was it. This was my first time here and a huge disappointment. I did let the server know how bad I thought the experience was and he apologized and said they were short staffed. There was no bread for most of the visit the gentleman waiting on us said they ran out and it was in the oven and brought it after our meal. 
Not sure I or we will return and it's a shame because it's right around the corner and I was really looking forward to going.
The food was good though but did not make up for the great lack of service."}
{"text":"Their food is precooked. Our waiter told one of my guests that she couldn't have her steak well done because they receive it cooked medium and that they wouldn't, \"couldn't\" cook it anymore for her. Seems fishy!!!! Too pricey for premade food! Yuck!"}
{"text":"Lunch here is great!  Nice \"patio\" in front to eat in when the weather is beautiful!  The bread, to die for!  Nice lunch spot for pizza and a salad!"}
{"text":"This place is always great..
And truly love Aaron .. we've had him as our waiter 3x now.. and truly love his service"}
{"text":"UPDATED:

We were sent a gift card in the mail and asked to give them another chance. We've been back several times since then and the service has improved tremendously!! Happy to see the changes made and we will be back!
Good food most of the time (when they actually get the order correct). The service is terrible and gets worse every time we go. This last time the waitress was awful. There were maybe 5 tables occupied in the restaurant so they obviously weren't busy... she got 2 out of 3 of the orders wrong, never refilled our drinks (we got up twice and did it ourselves. They saw us do it and nobody seemed to care. Too busy socializing.), we had to ask the manager for our check because she was nowhere to be seen, then she rang it up and dropped it off at the table. We finally get up to leave after an hour and a half and she chases us into the parking lot yelling that we have to come back because she charged us for someone else's bill. Seriously? Get some employees who actually want to work and not just sit around around on their phones and talking to the other staff. If this location woulbetter service we would go way more often!"}
{"text":"3 Stars but let me explain.... Food is Great, employees who are generally high school students in the evenings are wonderful, and for that it would be a FIVE STAR!  HOWEVER, every time I go in there there is a female manager or owner, not sure what she is but she is SO RUDE!  Not really rude to customers but I cannot stand the way she speaks down to the employees and has no problem critiquing them in front of customers.  I generally just get an order to go so I do not have to see her, it is so rude and really not being a good manager."}
{"text":"Good pricing. Good service. Good food. This is a great little neighborhood restaurant and we will definitely be back. The spicy Alfredo with sausage pasta was VERY good. Just the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"I've eaten here more than a couple times, and I always go back because of the food. I always order the Alfredo Supremo w/ the Italian sausage (spicy). It's the best and will always return for it. 

My Parents and I dined in today, waited to be seated for about 1.5 minutes. And it was nice that when we got seated, she took our beverage order. We understood that she was not our waitress and she reminded us that our waitress would be with us as soon as she finished with a huge order in the back. Which was understandable. 

One waitress came over and asked us what we wanted to drink. We informed her that our beverage order has already been taken. From what we understood, she was supposed to be our waitress. Annnnd, that was the last we saw of her. We were being waited on by another lady. 

Our drinks were brought, then our food. It was awesome because weonly waited about 10m until our food came. It was very quick and very yummy!!

What My Parents and I didn't like was that the waitress only stopped to, NOT ask us if we needed anything else, but dropped off the ticket and some to-go containers. We looked at each other like... ya know?

My Dad was looking at his empty cup hoping that she would have took a considerate glance around our table to see if any of us needed a refill or anything else. It's always weird how they quickly come-and-go when you're chewing. 

We flagged her down for the refill. She took his glass, THEN finally glanced around our tables only to see that we've in fact nearly finished our plates... and then took the to-go containers back. 'Uh... maybe that's why you should wait until towards the very ending of our meal instead of the beginning.'

My Folks and I enjoy tipping big. But with how no one checked on us to see if we needed anything else, any refills, to-go boxes, ect.; of course we would tip more. In this case, it didn't happen. 

I dine here more than My Parents and I'm most of the time being left unnoticed. I get seated first and have my order taken after a big crowd that I was way ahead of. Very, extremely annoying. No acknowledgement. 

My favorite dish, My Parents satisfaction of the food and ONLY the food is getting our (4) stars. The service gets zero. And I hope that any of the staff reading this will get, acknowledge and accept this discipline, and take better action to make it better. 

It's not personal. Just do better next time for everyone."}
{"text":"Some of the best pasta I have had yet. Fast and friendly service. Glad I wanted to try something new! The mac & cheese was INSANE!"}
{"text":"YUM!  I love this place!  It's decorated nicely, and the menu has lots of choices.  My favorite dish is the Curried Chicken and Pear Pasta.  It's a nice blending of Asian and Italian.  Delicious!  My alternate choice is the Chopped Gorgonzola Salad.  My friends swear by the Steak 'N Blue Salad, but I haven't tried it yet.  I have been there many times with my family and have hosted parties there as well. The service has always been prompt and helpful.  I'm so glad we have this restaurant nearby; it's one of my favorites."}
{"text":"So the whole family came here for the Great PaPa's birthday. This is his favorite place. I had never been here and had been told that it was a mediocre Italian restaurant  and that I probably wouldn't like it. But it wasn't my birthday decision.
There were only two servers and they were both working hard at keeping up. They were nice and personable. The service wasn't uber fast but there was always a smile.
So now to the food. Everyone enjoyed what they ate. This is shocking based on the variety of people that were eating, and the variety of temperaments. Just know that the food comes out really slow so be prepared. You are getting what you came in for. 
Would I come back?  Sure.... The price is good and the family was happy."}
{"text":"Great food!! The bread, the salads and the pasta was all amazing. Great flavors!

Service was good!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all!!!!  Artichoke crab and shrimp dip.....ummmm where's the crab and shrimp???  A fairly good amount of dip with a very small amount of garlic toast.    pizza was good even though they screwed up the order!  Service was slow.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"My favorite pasta place in Phoenix. There is a great variety of pastas here, not just the \"typical\" spaghetti, lasagna, etc.  I think their pricing is great too, with the average dish price being $10.  I personally love the brussel sprout and panchetta pasta, and can't get it enough. The decor of the place is very nice and contemporary and the bathrooms have always been very clean. I can't wait for the Chandler location to open, then I'll start going ALOT more! ;)"}
{"text":"Second visit. Great neighborhood restaurant feel. Outstanding service. My wife's pasta flavorful, my chicken mushroom dinner a bit too salty. Looking forward to a third time."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious. Consistent great service. No complaints about ANYTHING. I hate recommending it so highly because we'll have to wait for a table. 8-)"}
{"text":"Good food, not great, terrible service.   When I sat down at the bar not one employee greeted me.  The hostesses(at the bar not the door)  and two servers walked up right in front of me and said nothing.   The only one who said anything was the bartender and all he said was\" can I get you anything?\"  Not even a greeting.  These employees really need a lesson in customer service,  at least a reminder that they work for tips.  I do have to say that the bartender did get more pleasant and more attentive."}
{"text":"Where to begin... I LOVE this restaurant. I've been many time and have never been disappointed with neither the food nor the service. I've had so many dishes I couldn't possibly list them all. My favorite would have to be the Roasted Brussels Sprouts Beet Salad. It may sound a little strange but is absolutely delicious. My husband always gets the good ol' Three Cheese Mac and Cheese. It is so good he refuses to get anything else, ever. But enough about the food. The staff is polite and knowledgeable. The atmosphere is also great. The restaurant is a little on the small side so it fills quickly; plan accordingly. Do yourself a favor and try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Food is always consistently good.  This is s family favorite restaurant.   The atmosphere however is s bit loud and their music makes it worse. Some background music is nice but what they play does not work for the setting."}
{"text":"Ordered the Italian Sausage Dinner which had some kick to it as far as spice is concerned. Almost a little bit more than I would generally want in spicy-ness is concerned. 

Bread is sliced thin and comes with a blend of Italian Oils which was a good combination. They brought out more bread as we ran out and made sure we were taken care of. 

Service was very good with them filling up the drinks quite often.

Pricing for their meals were average to lower end ranging from  $9 - $13 which is good on the pocket book.

Menu is pretty extensive with pizza, pasta, salads and calzones.

First time here and certainly not the last, will be back another time."}
{"text":"Spaghetti... meat balls.  

I stopped in here with a friend because we were both hungry and this place was convenient for us.  The service that I received was nice and I enjoyed my server very much.

I was really sad that the place that advertises \"Spaghetti ... meat balls\" didn't nab at least 3 stars from me.  I suppose it is an uphill battle for any Italian restaurant because I don't eat pasta.  *gasp*  I know.  I just don't eat it.  I think pasta is a bunch of empty, tasteless calories.  Yikes.  So, when I go to Italian restaurants with friends, I always order any pasta dish w/o the pasta sub a veggie or lettuce.  I don't mind paying extra for what I want.  This is the first establishment that I've been told that wasn't an option.  I just don't see why not if you're making the ingredients to order to put OVER plain pasta or tossed with plain pasta.  Why can't I have it \"OVER\"/\"with\" anything I choose if I'm willing to pay?  I would have loved to have ordered the roasted asparagus with the Bolognese, I'd imagine if the Bolognese is half way decent, it would have been awesome with that bread.  IDK.  But, that's the way they choose to run their business and I was fine with that.  The server was kind enough to point me to some other options on the menu that did not have pasta in them. Great, I can work with that.  I went for the Asparagus Fra Diavolo with roasted chicken and the Mista Salad.  The Mista Salad was delicious.  I believe I had it with their house dressing.  YUMMY house dressing.  I also dipped their bread in the salad dressing.    

Oh wait.  How could I forget the bread.  Wowzer!  Their bread that they serve prior to the meal is simply divine.  Warm, moist, soft and tasty.  Very good.  

So, back to the Asparagus Fra Diavolo with roasted chicken.  I just simply didn't enjoy it.  It didn't taste good to me.  :-(  My friend ordered the Jambalaya and that tasted pretty good to him.  I have heard the east VAlley location was good, so maybe I can give that a try some day.

Sadly, this was likely my first time and my last time here.  I didn't get to find out if Spaghetti enjoyed \"meat'ing\" Balls or not... So sad.

BTW, they have a very nice patio dining space."}
{"text":"So, it was Knife's first night on the town for 2016. Had a hankerin' (yes, I said hankerin') for some pasta and wasn't sure where to go. Had seen Babbo's next to the grocery store, but it didn't originally come to mind. Buca di Beppo and Carrabba's did...but no Babbo's. So after zooming past Carrabba's, I decided not to circle back and instead give Babbo's a try...and boy am I glad I did! Babbo's has quite a few locations in the valley and it is easy to see why. The place is YUMMO (yes, I said YUMMO)! I went on a Saturday at about 6:30pm and there was a wait for a table. No problem, since I was \"Fork\"less, Knife decided to sit at the bar. The bartender, although very busy, quickly greeted me and took my drink order. Warm and wonderful  focaccia bread, oil/balsamic quickly followed. I then placed my order of the Italian Sausage pasta dish and dove in to the bread. Very soon thereafter my entree arrived. It was great! The sauce was perfect. So many times in chain Italian places, you get a flavorless, \"meh\" type of Ragu . Not here! The sauce was flavorful and I mopped up what was left after my pasta with what was left of the focaccia (not much of either). The Italian sausage was spicy (as advertised in the menu) and the pasta cooked to perfection. Another thing I want to mention is that although I was clearly done with my entree (my dishes had been promptly removed), and the place was hopping, there was no push to move me along. Knife does not like being rushed when dining. So, although this place has paper napkins and serves water in plastic cups, this is pretty much \"fine\" and fun dining. Knife is one satisfied diner and will be coming back to Babbo again and again...you should too.

{"text":"We went to this location due to having a gift card and a 3 star rating sounds about right as the food was ok, best part was probably the bread in the beginning and the pasta dishes we had weren't as creamy as other Italian dishes I've had, but it was flavorful.  It was busy, but not to where it took more than 5 minutes to get seated.  Waitress was nice and did her job.  This is a good alternative to a mid-range restaurant such as TGIF or Chili's with an Italian focus"}
{"text":"Other than waiting 45 min for a table that was promised in 25, it was amazing.  The manager did come out and apologize and comped an appetizer.   

It was a great meal and wonderful atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal with a fantastic waitress, Meghan.  She has only been serving for 2 weeks, and did an amazing job.  Be sure to ask for her section when you come.  Chicken parm and pizza were both good. Meghan offered bread to go, drinks to go.  She even boxed up our garlic butter and brought us oil to go.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Babbo's food is quite good and the menu is big enough to come back over and over without a repeat (if you choose that strategy).  Take-out here is speedy and the food travels well to be served at home which is always a plus, granted we're only 4 minutes away.  My only gripe is the dining room comes across a bit too \"cafeteria\" which could be solved with very small tweaks!  Overall, a staple in our household."}
{"text":"I went here for the mon/tues 6.99 spaghetti and meatballs special and it was surprisingly delicious. They serve warm focaccia bread with oil and balsamic to start. The prices are very reasonable and you can't beat the 6.99 spaghetti and meatball deal! Definitely worth a visit for someone watching their budget."}
