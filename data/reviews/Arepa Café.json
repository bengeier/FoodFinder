{"text":"I love this place. The variety of Arepas is great! Which makes it hard to decide which one to indulge in. So I usually go for the Arepa sampler. Which is 3 mini ones, a meat, chicken and a veggie. The side sauces are great. Go easy on the red sauce, that one has a kick! They pair well with a cold beer. Service could be better."}
{"text":"So, I was intrigued about what Toronto (farthest north I have been so far in the Americas)  would have as arepa's.

Me and my wife both had the Pablellon, and we both loved them.  Great authentic Venezuelan arepas.  We generally don't buy arepa's from a restaurant.  I personally think she makes the best arepas.  So we were very surprised."}
{"text":"A gem. Went there with a large group and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Try the sugarcane lemonade - yummy. Loved their quinoa salad - light and fresh. We tried six arepas and enjoyed all of them. The standouts are the roasted pork, carne mechada, and pabellon. Both the tostones and empanadas are good. Loved their spicy sauce. For dessert you must try the tres leches cake."}
{"text":"the food was great and the server was very kind. The three sauces they provided with the arepa were quite a nice touch.  My personal favorite was the garlic mayo"}
{"text":"Reina Pepiada was cold, tasteless, and overpriced. Service is also terrible. They're obviously understaffed. Would not recommend! Never coming back."}
{"text":"Great environment and design. Delicious arepas. The Reina Pepiada was perfect.  Fresh juices - passion fruit was tart!  I wanted to try the entire menu!"}
{"text":"I visited this place when it opened and was underwhelmed but it's fine for a five dollar sandwich . Went today and was charged over $10 for TINY sandwich that was vegetarian! What an unbelievable rip off. I thought I would get two for that price. Never going back"}
{"text":"I'm a repeating customer at arepa Cafe. However the last experience I had rubbed me the wrong way. I was greatly disturbed by the female lady that was attending the tables. I don't believe one of the cooks knew an inkling of Spanish and it looked as if he may have been running a bit behind in orders. Which was completely fine by me, I really didn't mind waiting.  However the female and cook got into a mine verbal disagreement due to his lateness and I wasn't happy with the way she was dealing with him in front of customers. When I thought it was dropped she then went to the other employees who did speak Spanish and started talking about him to them and I could hear. I work in the serving industry and deal with people all days everyday. In my eyes I saw this as bullying and was very upset by her lack of professionalism. They need to find a new server. Other than that the empanadas are BOMBBBB! literally to die for"}
{"text":"I've never had an arepa before coming to this place, so I can't comment on the authenticity on their product, but whatever it is, it's pretty tasty...

...and combine those South American flavours with a clean and modern interior and very friendly service (everyone who works here is strangely warm and fuzzy), and this place is a definite pick for a quick and reasonably inexpensive meal.

I first wandered in on a Saturday morning not quite understanding the whole arepa-thing and expecting a more traditional brunch, but these little sandwiches actually go quite well with their very good coffee."}
{"text":"This place is great

The service is attentive and the food is excellent

The tequenos are probably my favourite appetizer, probably because I love all 3 side dips you can use on them, 

Arepas are very good and filling as well. I always leave feeling full"}
{"text":"Arepa! 

I love the concept of dedicating a restaurant to these venezuelan cornbread sandwiches! I think it's a great idea considering how many people are looking for gluten-free options. Our waitress was very knowledgable about what an arepa was and made sure we were thoroughly taken care of :)

So onto the food, I ordered the pulled pork arepa with a side of coleslaw, my bill came to 12 dollars I believe (don't quote me though). The pork was rather chewy and dry, (not the expected over sauced, melt in your mouth kind of deal). I wasn't too pleased with the filling however the cornbread part was nice and toasty. The coleslaw was literally served in what looked like a take out sauce container, it was maybe a table spoon. It kind of threw me off because it promised a \"side of coleslaw,\" and coleslaw's cheap I thought you may as well add more for the same price. 

My friend ordered the fried cassava I believe dipped in a guacamole, she informed me they were good and the sauce was fine as well.

So yeah, not the best value for what you're getting, but if you've never tried an arepa you should at least once!"}
{"text":"I am confused as to all the positive reviews. My salt cod arepa was well seasoned but leaked fishy juices through the plastic basket it was served in all over the table. I had to get myself a plate. The arepa then disintegrated and I finished with a fork. My companion had the ham and cheese which was ice cold deli ham and cold shredded bagged cheddar. For seven dollars! - I would have been embarrassed to serve it at a school cafeteria. The best thing about the place was the hot sauce.  I'll never go back."}
{"text":"This is a weekly regular for me, always delicious and always smiling servers. Arepas are so tasty, and this place serves knows how to get them right. Great americanos. Tasty, and some gluten-free, desserts. Amazing sauces to go with arepas...try the garlic mayo!"}
{"text":"I have been to Arepa Cafe three times now since last summer. I decided to give it a try after my friend showed me pictures of the  arepas online after she discovered the restaurant from BlogTO- they are as gorgeous in real like as they are in all of the pictures! Each time I have eaten there, I have tried a different arepa; I have tried the grilled chicken, pork (wasn't shredded when I asked for shredded, but still delicious), and the plantain and black bean one. All were amazing and it's hard to pick a favourite since they are all so different, but I think if I had to get one of those again, it'd be the plantain one. 

They are very generous with their toppings and the corn-based flat bread is amazing, great for those on a gluten free diet. Also, the sauces they bring you for the arepas are great too. The aioli and the red hot sauce are my favourite (the hot sauce is extremely spicy, and I love spicy food!). 

I highly recommend this place if you are looking for something different and have never tried an Arepa/Venezuelan cuisine before. It is especially nice in the summer time when the front garage door is open!"}
{"text":"Sometimes it can be difficult to find a delicious, inexpensive, quick meal on Queen West these days, but stumbling upon Arepa Cafe just west of Spadina provides just that. 

The décor is inviting, with exposed brick walls and soft lighting, less a restaurant than a café, per its name. 

The menu is simple, featuring a number of Latin American starters, salads, breakfast options, and of course dessert, but let's be clear: you're coming here for an arepa!

With nearly 15 varieties of this traditional Venezuelan street food from which to choose, there's something for everyone, and only one prices above $10. The best of the bunch is surely the reina pepiada (curvy queen), a mouth-watering mixture of roast-chicken, avocado, coriander and red onion, stuffed into a cornmeal sandwich. The cornmeal arepas seem to always be freshly made; they typically have a just-out-of-the-oven feel. The adobo roasted pork is not to be missed, though \"la llanera\" beef tenderloin has a slightly overdone taste to it, and is not worthy of the $10.50 price point.

All arepas are served with condiments: a mayo, a green pepper sauce, and if you can stomach it, an intimidating scotch bonnet hot sauce (word of warning: not to be taken lightly, one dab will leave a fiery hot trail from your mouth to your stomach). A small ramekin of fresh coleslaw is also provided. It should be mentioned that although this coleslaw can be downed in one spoonful, it should not be overlooked as a mere garnish. It is a refreshing complement to one's arepa. Even coleslaw-haters will appreciate the freshly shredded cabbage and robust dressing.

A few alfajoles can be a good finisher, but unlike the fresh arepas served, the desserts are not freshly made. The dulce de leche and shortbread can be a bit hard, near stale, and the same can be said for the Venezuelan tres leches cake. Still, after a dollop of scotch bonnet hot sauce on one's arepa, the cool and ultra-sweet dessert might just be what the doctor ordered. 

The relaxed nature of the cafe combined with outstanding Latin American fare at a wholly reasonable price means multiple return trips. Everyone who frequents this area must stop by and try an arepa...you'll never want to eat that gordita at Taco Bell again."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Service was friendly if you choose to dine in.  They'll make modifications with a smile (I wanted my meal sans Arepa Cornbread).  Fresh ingredients and a great combination of flavours!"}
{"text":"The place itself is nice, convenient location and good environment overall but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm Venezuelan so I know exactly how everything is supposed to taste like and Arepa Cafe is a 7/10. 
They add ingredients that some dishes are not supposed to have like lemon to the \"Reina\" which is the most famous arepa and the meat from the pabellon lacks a bit of seasoning. 
I heard that they trademarked the word Arepa which is a cheap move so I rather not support them anymore. It's like trademarking the word Burger (So nobody else can use it as part of a name). 
It's a shame..."}
{"text":"The foood was OK but the portion size was insanely small. I ordered a side of coleslaw and had less than 2 forkfulls. The box it came in was about 5% full. 

This is just plain insulting. The place is a rip off. I strongly reccommoend against it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is moi caliente! What's an arepa? Don't worry about it, just eat it. They're delicious! Reusable Tupperware! Your welcome earth (loooove yooooooooou, don't know where I'd be without you). Come here if you like eating in a funky garage amongst the paper air planes."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great arepas and love that they're gluten free and surprisingly an awesome chai latte"}
{"text":"Yum. I've been going to this place for about a year now and it never lets me down. The arepa's sandwiches are always fresh and tasty. They eve sell the corn four so you can
try your hand at making your own arepas at home! The deserts are also very good and 
made in house."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I love this friendly cheerful place. Big screen Tv for sports, or chat w your friends or the owner as you wolf down these delicious, warm, crisp arepas."}
{"text":"Tasty food from Venezuela, and amazing service. We came to Arepa for lunch and were amazed at how friendly the establishment is. I had the first chicken Arepa with cheese and I highly recommend it. The bread was unique and the Arepa itself very satisfying. Their wonderful espresso coupled with their alfojeras makes for a great dessert. Good value as well!"}
{"text":"A casual place where you can find authentic Venezuelan snacks and some traditional meals. Being Venezuelan, this place definitely reminded me of back home with their tequeños, guarapo, and arepas!!"}
{"text":"The space is open with high ceilings and exposed beams, the staff is very friendly and we were served quickly. The arepa sandwiches are authentic Venezuelan, and overstuffed, so be very careful or wear a bib!  I had the sugarcane lemonade and it was superb, just the right mix of sweet and tart. They also have Malta, which I remember from South America too. Overall excellent and the only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because, I had the fried cheese stick appetizers, and while they were also yummy and authentic (I've only had this kind of cheese in South America - it's white, unaged, moist to the point of being slightly watery - sort of like ricotta), one of them had a coil of metal wire stuck in it! They comped the appetizer of course, and it happened to be the last one - I'm assuming it was accidentally left from when they were formed or breaded or something, but yikes!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Tried it for the first time on Friday night and get wait to go back. Good atmosphere, good service and delicious, nutritious food! Also their sauces are a major bonus."}
{"text":"Regularly visit because I seem to be addicted. Good food, fairly priced. I ordered the Domino - they are really flexible about substituting ingredients within reason. They are quick and friendly. But watch out for the hot sauce - its hot but also delicious. A little too hot for me but they do warn you in advance. Most people love the heat :) 
All-in-all, if you like Latin American Food, this is a must visit!"}
{"text":"Oh So Satifsying! Came here the other day after my boyfriend and I heard about this place and decided to give it a try..We used to frequent an arepa place in Kensington market before it closed down and was quite sad that we wouldn't find another place just like it..and we were amazed to find a place that exceeded our expectations!
Its a good size place with quite a few tables and seats..you can dine in or take out.
Our waitress was very friendly and since it was our first time here, she helped us with the menu..She recommended the reina pepiada (chicken, avocado, red onion, coriander)-which was their number one selling arepa and the pabellon arepa (flank steak, black beans, mozerella cheese and sweet plaintain). She sold me on the pabellon arepa and my boyfriend ended up getting the adobbo roasted pork..we also ordered tequenos..Our tequenos arrived first with 3 different sauces to accompany (hot sauce, green pepper sauce and a mayo/aoili)..The hot sauce was REALLY spicy (well according to us anyways) and the green pepper and the mayo ended being really nice accompaniment to the tequenos..oh gooey cheesey fried goodness! It also came with guacamole..mmm...guac..

Our arepas came..and my gosh they looked yummy! I really enjoyed mine and thought it was savoury and oozing with flavour..We were both stuffed after our last bite..I had to give the rest of mine to him cause I was so full..But before leaving, we had to try the beet root brownie..it was quite nice, it wasn't as sweet and not as gooey but still had good texture and a nice cocoa taste to it
Overall, we thought the service was great, food was delicious and we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. It's a great place to go in the afternoon and read or work while you eat a tasty meal. There are always a few people so it's not dead, but never too packed.

The food is always tasty and a change from the everyday flavours in my lunch meals. Fresh, compact, but very filling. I usually get the arepa with black beans, avocado, plantain and cheese. The cassava fries are great too, as are the desserts if you have room."}
{"text":"3/5! We went with the waiter's recommendation and tried the Ilanera - beef option and it was okay. We ended up using a lot of the hot sauce and garlic mayo to improve the taste. I am not sure I would go back but the Good news is that there are gluten free options and lots of variety to choose from."}
{"text":"Sooo good. Yuca fry things blew my mind. Very cute environment and great service. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Arepa Café is destined to become one of my regular hangouts..
The food is fresh + flavourful.
The service is very accommodating + laid back.
The ambience is loungy + funky. I love it.
The prices are also great and it's one of the very few, if not only, Venezuelan cafés in the city.

For an appetizer (and believe me it's a must-have) I tried the tequeños-basically an amazing version of cheese sticks...
For the main portion of my meal I tried the avocado and fresh cheese arepa, a type of venezuelan corn bread bun filled with fresh cold/hot ingredients. It was lovely. 
I also tried the sugarcane lemonade. yum.
Some of my friends tried the desserts. They looked so good.
I'll be back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"We were 3 people who shared 2 salads (watercress and quinoa) and we each ordered an arepa. The salads were both excellent and really upped the healthy and fresh quotient of the meal.

I had the 'Domino' arepa - beans and cheese. It was my first time eating arepa and I was happy to try a delicious new food. The arepa 'bread' was excellent and there was loads of filling. You can also add sauces - 3 different ones are brought to the table so you can enjoy as much or as little as you prefer.

We didn't have dessert but they had some yummy-looking cheesecakes among other choices.

Service was fantastic, friendly and quick - our waiter was a young Venezuelan man whose name I didn't get but who went out of his way to accommodate our every request and who was attentive without being obtrusive. Thanks for making our experience great!"}
{"text":"I've been curious to try the Arepa cafe on Queen since I've moved down to Queen West mainly because I had no idea what an Arepa was.  Being the food-thusiastic curious person I am, I needed to figure that out.   The thing about the cafe is you can order at the counter to take out your meal or wait to be served.  
Arepas are small cornbread sandwiches mainly sold in Venezuela and stuffed with a variety of fillings.  There are over 10 kinds of Arepas at the cafe to choose from with fillings such as meat, pork, steak, chorizo, octopus, beans, plantains, avocado and cheese just to name a few.  There is also a fresh juice bar which I will have to try next time and some other entrees, salads and desserts.
It's a good place for a small meal or snack."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this cafe randomly while shopping on Queen West. I was sceptical at first, as a) I was craving a big greasy burger and fries (which this place obviously does not have) and b) I had no idea what arepas were!

I wasn't disappointed. I ordered the 'curvy queen' arepas with chicken, avocado, coriander and red onion and it was very good indeed. The chicken was flawless, as fresh and well-cooked as you're ever likely to find. The abundance of avocado in my arepas initially worried me (there was a lot!) but it worked perfectly, helping calm somewhat the powerful tastes of the onions, spicy chicken and coriander. Hot sauce and garlic mayo were offered on the side and the combination of both made my arepas even more delicious.

Prices were reasonable. Portions look a bit small but honestly my arepas kept me full all day. Service was speedy and very friendly."}
{"text":"There is something that is so effortlessly cool about this place that you can't help but just want to hang out here all the time. The space is very bright, clean and modern and on a warm summery night (or day for that matter) they open up the giant window at the front so that a cool city breeze comes in an mingles with the stylish young patrons as they enjoy the evening and eat their Venezuelan corn pockets.

But this place is more than just style, the food is also really great, and after trying my first arepa earlier this year in NYC, the arepa Cafe has become a once a month staple for me.

I have now had the flank steak, marinated octopus and adobo pork arepas and they were all great. The corn pockets they are served in are freshly made an nicely crispy on the outside and fillings on the inside are uniformly tasty and well prepared. 

If I had to pick a favourite I would go with the octopus as a) it's a nice change of pace from the typical meat based sandwich and b) and because this particularly tender mollusc was marinated in just the right amount of citrusy deliciousness.

Other useful things to know about this place:

1) My gluten-free friend is able to eat here which is a huge plus.
2) For best results, the garlicky white sauce should be squeezed generously onto your arepa throughout your meal
3) The vibrantly orange habanero based hot sauce is actually f'ing hot - but if you like spice you will have a hard time not dabbing (seriously dabbing is all you need) drop after drop of nose running, sweat inducing zing onto every bite
4) It is not possible to eat this without getting at least some of it on you
5) Don't forget to jam some of the coleslaw they give you into the arepa as well
6) The portion sizes aren't huge (but not necessarily small either), which on the bright side means that you should definitely make room for dessert. They have a fried plantaine, cheese and honey dish that is hits all the right notes while being deceptively simple which I highly recommend.

In terms of price, the last time we went (and dined in) my wife and I each had an arepa and a bottle of Mill St. Organic and we ended up paying about $32 all-in, so you're getting reasonably good value. 

What more can I say, go check this place out."}
{"text":"What a disappointment

Ordered the reina chicken arepa - it was described as roast chicken with red onion avocado and cilantro.

Guys be warned! It's a COLD sandwich! Here I was on a cold day, excited to tuck into a warm sandwich and all I got was a cold filling, which was beyond bland! :( no zing of red onions or the Taste of cilantro.

Great concept ... Boring execution!"}
{"text":"I have quite a few allergies and the staff at Arepa Cafe are always knowledgeable and willing to work around my allergies. Mine and my husbands favorite go to place for date night. Did I mention it's gluten free."}
{"text":"Service was slower than a moving continent. Chicken was dry. Adobo roasted pork was just pepper pork chops in cornbread. Trusted yelp reviews and you guys have no tastebuds lol. Overpriced beer and just everything was mediocre to meeehhhh. Not coming here again"}
{"text":"Fantastic Arepas 

South American cuisine in Toronto has had it's ups and downs and in the past it was mostly due to ingredients. Now with global trade it is getting easier and Arepa Cafe is trying to certainly take advantage of that. First Areparia I have found that gets it close. Missing the proverbial SPAM Arepa but that may just be because it is tastier at home with the F1 race going on in the background. 

Super friendly atmosphere, food tasted delicious and on the mark. It was served fresh and properly and the dessert was great as well so all in all. Fantastic place to visit. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Clean, quick service and good food. Worth a stop by if you're looking for something casual and have never tried arepas before. It's nice to see something new in Toronto. I don't think I've come across any other arepas in Toronto. However, definitely not as flavourful as other Arepas I've had."}
{"text":"I really love Arepa Cafe and I'm happy it's close to home. It's clean and inviting inside with a good streetside view of Queen.

The portions are not huge but it's a good midday snack with a beer kind of place. Some would call that lunch but I just won't. The beef, avocado, cheese and tomato arepa is fantastic. I've also tried the pulled pork one which was equally tasty. All the arepas come with a couple forkfuls of slaw to help calm down the heat of the accompanying sauces. The food comes with 3 sauces which they bring on the side. The green sauce is nice but the yellow sauce is freaking hot.

Pricing is reasonable."}
{"text":"SO FILLING.

I had the Adobo Pork and it was delicious and more than enough food. Especially liked making use of the green pepper and spicy sauces. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is great! Food is amazing, especially the Tequenos! Some people might say the the food is overpriced but it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Pros:
Generous portions for a good price
Unique, fresh food
Great(est) espresso
Good atmosphere and design

Cons: 
Hard to see from the outside (needs more signs)
1:30 and it's still packed, talk about popular

Would def. go back ... four people had four different things on the menu and we all enjoyed it"}
{"text":"It was a sunny and \"warm\" afternoon in February when we decided to have late lunch at Arepa Cafe'. After reading other reviews we were excited to eat some arepas!!!
Ambiance 4/5
I love the brick walls and the decorations, it feels very modern yet classic. the owners are very welcoming. I didn't really like the tables (in-between cafe' and restaurant style) and the counter looked very old. We were sitting close to the door so everytime someone was entering/exiting there was a gust of cold hair.
Food 4/5
Food is delicious, everything seems traditional with few items that add a more fusion twist. We had the yucca fries as appetizer. It was crispy  and perfectly cooked (well seasoned). The order comes with an avocado sauce (not much different that guacamole). They also offer you 4 other sauces, one better than the other!!! We tried 2 different arepas but I don't remember the names. I have mixed feelings about them: the ingredients are fresh and in large quantity compared to the arepa itself. It is difficult to bite it and taste all the different flavors together. The arepa is filling but it come with a very small side of slow (it was ok). If you want a \"real\" side you have to place a separate order. 

If you are in the neighbourhood and you want something different, this is a good place to go!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Arepa once before, but prior to my yelping days.
My first experience was a good one, I got the Beef Tenderloin, packed it on with some hot sauuuuce, life was great. The day I had happened to go, it was somewhat empty, I presume due to the rain and the odd Friday afternoon timing.

The GF wanted to try it this time so we went to Arepa for lunch yesterday around 1pm. It was somewhat packed, but not overly busy. 

The place itself is a cool space, I mean whose not a fan of exposed brick. 

The menu is simple, the speciality being the Arepa sandwiches. They make the Arepa's fresh and have different fillings.

I thought id be a little more adventourous this time and got the Cod Fish. I have to say I wasnt very impressed. It was shreaded codfish in a sauce with some onions and peppers. It was tasty, but not as tasty as the beef tendorloin I had my first experience.  My gf decided to get their flagship chicken arepa. In a nutshell, it was grilled chicken mixed in with avocado, a little underwhelming I'd say.

Also, the service was fairly lacklustre, it is a cafe so I am not expecting the world, but our entree's came before our sides of Yuca and Empanadas and I had to ask twice for a glass of water. Normally I wouldn't mind but I felt the waiters were their to save us the effort of getting up to the counter rather then taking care of the patrons. 

All in all, good eats but to sum it up its regular sandwiches in a fresh corn meal bun. Its good not great."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night, and it was very good. Lots of different options for dinner, and some great homemade beverages (the lemonade is especially good - not too sweet). The servers were very friendly and efficient and the restaurant itself was clean and well-kept. 

The only knocks on the place are that the arepas themselves were overstuffed to the point where they were overflowing with ingredients. It may seem odd to complain about getting too much food, but it actually did make it difficult to eat. Maybe 10% less would have made it more manageable. Also, the a la carte / \"make your own\" option was not viable because the prices were too high. In some cases it seemed like you'd pay as much for 3 items from the a la carte menu as you would for 4+ similar items from the standard menu. I know it's a premium for the staff to make exactly what you want, but paying $3-5 extra for them to swap out some veggies seems a little steep. 

Overall, though, this place was great. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended to me as an \"authentic Latin American cuisine\", and I had a great time there. Ice tea was amazing, and fresh arepa was delicious. Also had a bite of my friend's guava cheesecake - heavenly :) 

Will definitely come back for dessert next time"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Toronto.  Order the Reina. Be careful with the hot sauce. I always like to have mine with a mocha, chayote salad and plaintain desert. Bring a friend so you have enough room try everything!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last few months.  Love the arepa sampler, which with the soup of the day is a full meal.  Very filling. This is a great place and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Thanks to Gloria B. I was introduced to a Venezuelan sandwich - essentially cornbread filled some delicious stuffing of your choice. I ordered the bacalao special on the board....sooo much food. Don't let the size of the sandwich deceive you, I couldn't even finish it.

The fun part is the sauces you get to put in your sandwich - there's a ranch one, a relish one, and a freaking hot sauce. So hot, so delicious, though expect some sweat and tears.

Great quick place for lunch for $8."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, just solid well priced food and service every time

Good alternative to your everyday burrito

Personal favorites: la llanera, and pabellon. Mmm green pepper sauce...."}
{"text":"It's just ok, decent but not authentic. Had 4 beef empanadas: 3 of 4 didn't have any beef in them. Also had an order of cachapas: the cheese was more like mozzarella and the cachapas were good but Americanized. Had some papelon con limon: tasted good but more like lemonade. Quesillo was more like flan, not the thicker, cheesier version we make in Venezuela. Ordered mine through Uber Eats... No napkins or utensils. Seriously? Really wanted to love it--ended up just liking it. And it was too expensive, too, for what you get."}
{"text":"Had  llanera and sifrina arepas for lunch and quesillo for desert.  Good service, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"GENERAL NOTES
An arepa is a Venezuelan corn-bread like pita thing stuffed with delicious meats and veggies. The meat is generally the kind you'd scoop out of a chafing dish with a large ice cream scooper. You can get lots of different things on the arepa but the most common inclusions are beans, plantains, cheese and avocado. They are moderately sized and delicious.

The arepa itself is just the cornbread thing and you can get it one the side of a platter which just contains the toppings on a plate. These are bigger and also delicious. 

The also apparently offer breakfast arepas. Most likely delicious. 

MENU RECOMMENDATIONS
Pabellon Arepa - shredded flank steak, beans, cheese, sweet plantain

It's a small wet baseball of delicious shredded meat with the listed toppings and although sort of messy, this is a big win. I was a little dissatisfied in paying $9.50 for this and I didn't get $9.50 full but it was very tasty. 

I'd be tempted to try the Pabellon Caraqueno (platter) version of this for $12.50 as you get that much more of everything...except the arepa! (you only get a 1/2)

LOCATION NOTES
North side of Queen just West of Augusta. Cafe style seating for 15-20. 

SERVICE NOTES
I always feel like I'm getting something authentic if the person serving me has what I believe is an authentic accent. Our server was great, very knowledge and helpful and said everything in a wonderfully difficult to understand Venezuelan accent. It was a little slow for a cafe but her helpfulness more than made up for that. 

HUMOUROUS STORY
Our server had that weird, extra terrestrial-looking hotness to her that made me flash back to being really weirded out by myself as a 14 year old for sort of being attracted to the women of Star Trek. Is it wrong to like aliens? I mean, they're not humans and I was under the impression that everything non-human was off the table, at least in terms of social acceptance. Ah...sexual discovery..."}
{"text":"Service was quick, place is bright and clean and the arepas are a-okay.  My only complaint is the size, more like an appetizer than a main course.

An arepa is a small bread made of corn flour with various fillings.  I had the Carne Mechada - shredded steak, tomato, garlic pepper & cumin.

The place was busy on a Tuesday night - a good sign on a cold, wintery night."}
{"text":"I ordered Vegetarian Arepa and tres de leche. They are very delicious. I always like arepas. The atmosphere is very casual, trendy, friendly, and clean. They have many latin Amerian things like empanada, alfajores, and plantain. I want to try all of them someday. I thought tres de leche $7.75 was overpriced, but it was very tasty. I will definitely come back and I am happy to find Arepa cafe."}
{"text":"This is my second visit in a month or so and I think its one of the best South American - Venezuelan food places in the city. It has a great ambiance, friendly and warm staff and of course the food is great. The first time I tried the Pabellon Veggie Arepa which was great value for money as it was flavourful and filling. Today I ordered the Cazon (cod fish) Arepa and Green Plantain Tostones. Really enjoyed the Green Tostones. Nice and crunchy which was complimented well with the sauces that they provided. The Cazon Arepa is good, but the only suggestion is to add some more veggies or greens to it so that its not purely fish that's filled inside the Arepa. Overall, I highly recommend this place. Hopefully this quality is maintained in the future."}
{"text":"Best Venezuelan restaurant in Toronto. Tequeños are to die for - chef's creations are the best. Arepa of the day - grilled pork loin, sunny side egg, arugula and chilli aioli was awesome!!! Service too always friendly and impecable....."}
{"text":"Arepa Cafe is the one of the most awesome chill out spots, with the best soul food I'm the T-Dot. The dining area is a chilled out heaven, clean and trendy. The service is friendly and spot on. Great tunes at a comfortable level, great for conversation. I ordered La Reina Pepiada, the most delicious Arepa with tonnes of Guacamole, roasted chicken, chopped onion and coriander, the sandwich comes with a side of fresh coleslaw. I topped it all with a pint of Tank house Ale. Delish! One of my favourite Toronto spots."}
{"text":"My fav new find, great alternative to the usual fast food fare. I dropped in after a late movie and experienced my first aprepa. Tried the carne mechada and loved it, was very filling and a good size portion. 

Looking fwd to trying the chorizo and roasted chicken on my next visit. Very happy to have some variety in the neighbourhood besides Subway and KFC"}
{"text":"They no longer use two whole pieces of pork. Instead, they put some sort of shredded pork. Still yummy but not quite."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place whilst enduring Queen West one night and was ecstatic to find a wide range of traditional Latin American and specifically Venezuelan fare.

Their alfajores are pretty decent and filling, and the dulce de leche cheesecake was great. My friend had the carrot cake, which was a huge size and without raisins or nuts (a different take, but still it was great).

I will definitely be back to try their traditional cornmeal \"taco\" sandwiches."}
{"text":"Deceptively filling sandwiches - had the La Pelua and was totally satisfied. Very casual vibe, clean, and friendly. Would definitely recommend ."}
{"text":"Great authentic South American restaurant. Their arepa with avocado and cheese is fantastic. Besides they have a lot to offer and a lot of space to seat."}
{"text":"We visited Arepa Cafe on my sister's recommendation.  Our party of 4 gladly found a table in this open, lofty cafe.  The atmosphere was laid back with neat art across the brick walls.

For those that are not sure what an Arepa is, it is a Venezuelan sandwich of sorts.  Instead of bread, they were a puffy small corn tortilla, think polenta meets tortilla.  They have various filling from chicken & avocado to adobe pork. 

I order the cod platter with black beans and rice while the rest of my party went with a different stuffed arepa. **disclaimer if you are watching your sodium, avoid the cod. It is marinaded in salt, very good but can be quite salty for some**
My platter was delish, the black beans was perfect cooked with the right amount of cheese.  The also include sweet plantain and half a unstuffed arepa.  The rest of my party enjoyed their arepas.

The best part of the meal were the three sauces they provide you for your meals.  The green pepper sauce is absolutely yummy, so refreshing, I literally was pouring it on my rice.  The garlic sauce was also yummy.  If you like spicy, the orange sauce, it is a habenro (sp?) pepper sauce.  I tried a pea size drop and my mouth was on fire.

They also had some lovely desserts but we were all too full from dinner.  The portion sizes look deceiving as the meals were quite filling.  I would go back for dessert.

For the 4 of us, four meals and an appetizer (cassava fries and guac), the bill was $50 with tip and taxes!

If you are in the mood for some latin inspired eats, Arepa Cafe is definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch. 
The arepa was perfect and the hot sauce had a good bite. 
This is a great spot for the gluten free person in your life as there are a ton of options!
I will def be back."}
{"text":"I think I've eaten here 3 times in one week because this place is so good. I always get the Curvy Queen which is avocado and chicken inside a toasted but soft cornmeal bun. It's always a ton of food and is delicious and filling. I can't give it 5/5 because it is a little pricy, but if it wasn't for that I definitely would because it tastes so good! I am so happy the meal is gluten free as well."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience with \"la llanera\" steak arepa. Took a long while (25 minutes) to be made - and when it came the the steak was burnt outside and bloody red inside, literally with blood, couldn't eat more than a few bites.  Looks like they forgot about our order and then they did it in a rush.
On the other hand, the Pulpo arepa was really good, my gf dixit."}
{"text":"Been here twice already. Loved it both times. I had the Reina Pepiada and my boyfriend had the Adobo Roasted Pork. I would have prefered if mine was a hot meal like the La Catira I had the first time, but still good nonetheless. A little heavy on the avocado in the arepa, it kept falling out of the sides making it hard to eat. But you can never go wrong when you add one of three homemade sauces! Go big or go home, that green spicy sauce is damn spicy. And I'm Korean. 

The Roasted Pork came with a stackfull of meat. I like to think of it as a guy's meal. Maximum meat, minimum everything else. Tons of juicy sauce and flavour pouring out of it at each bite though. I love the corn meal bread used to make the arepas. I would go just to order a side of \"bread.\" Who would've thought this engineering between cornbread and sandwich would be such an awesome combo! 

We also had the fried empanadas. Not so sure what my take is on this one because it was my first time trying these. Nothing terrible but I just thought it was mediocore. Just basically a fried dumpling with either chicken or fish inside. I just ate it with a lot of the green sauce to amp it up a bit.

I also tried their sugar cane lemonde. Definitely tastes like lemonade with a ton of sugar! Very sweet, very sour, very good (at least in my opinion) for people with a heavy sweet tooth. 

Overall, I love this place, the feel of it, the decor, the staff, the food. I would keep coming back until I tried every one of their arepas."}
{"text":"Visited Arepa Café for the second time recently and left underwhelmed. The cod fish arepa was soggy and my partner's had too much salt. Charming café ambience but overpriced for the quantity and quality of food you get."}
{"text":"Really good! I wish there was more yucca in the order and overall the prices are a little high, but the arepa itself is very filling. I had the pabellon arepa and it was huge! It was also full of wonderful flavors. Don't forget the sauces either, they're awesome. The red one, I think, is very spicy though. Service was good and I was actually surprised it wasn't busier considering it was Friday evening."}
{"text":"My friend and I were excited to try them out. It's a nice cozy place. We were greeted well. We ordered 2 arepas a chicken one and a steak. Both lacked flavours especially the chicken it was blend and cold. Mixed in avocado and loss of cheese. Basically there was no flavour in it. 
Very disappointed ... not sure how authentic arepas taste but definitely not going back"}
{"text":"Brought a Venezuelan friend here, and she loved it. The tequeños are a must-try with the garlic mayo, and the arepas were pretty good too (I got the arepas platter). 

While the beef in it was a bit dry, the black beans and guacamole chicken arepas in the platter were pretty decent, but the tequeños was definitely the highlight. 

There seemed to be a lot of Venezuelan locals eating, so it seems like a good place to check if it's your first-time trying Venezuelan food, or if you miss it. 

The service was friendly, and gave great advice on the food, while the atmosphere was relaxed and cozy, perfect for brunch, afternoon tea or for drinks at night."}
{"text":"I made my own meal and it was absolutely delicious! Eggs, fresco, arepas, arugula, eggs and caramalixed onions! So good, will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"Now that Arepa has fully taken hold and people all over town are talking about \"that arepa place\", I have been back to see if things have changed. Shari's comment about a drop of coleslaw is correct- so for the price you get a small arepa and a tablespoon of coleslaw. That's still not gonna fill me up. The most recent trip there, I tried a different variation of the seafood arepa and got the octopus. Amazing- ceviche-like flavour. The empolyee advised me that it was cold- which is good to know in advance. But, i was really impressed with the quality of the octupus- texture and fresh lime flavor were great. To fill up, I also split the cachapa again. Not so special, really- corn pancakes that get cold fast. This is still not the place I'm going for a quick take-out dinner. But when others suggest it, I know what I'll be eating next time (2 octopus arepa)!"}
{"text":"What the heck is an arepa?

Let me tell you, it's a delicious cornbread pita stuff with yummy fillings.
The menu here is pretty lengthy with lots of delicious treats.. but let's start with the arepas. All come with tasty coleslaw, an array of dipping sauces, and of course, a vast sea of fillings. For example...(brace yourself)
-Chicken, avocado, red onion and coriander 
-Roasted pork, anatto & caramelized onions
-Flank steak, garlic pepper, cumin
-Grilled chicken, tomato and herb mayo
-And the list goes on....and on (including vegetarian options)

The arepas range from $7.50 - $9ish, and are also offered as a combo. Drink choices include pop, coffee or beer (yes it's licensed).

Other dishes include salads (watercress salad, chayote coleslaw, beet salad with parsley), finger foods like tequenos (stuffed cheese pastery) and empanadas, and platters to share.

The icing on the cake? Literally, because they have cakes and sweets, but you MUST try the dolce de lece cookie. A shortbread-like cookie covered in icing sugar and filled with a soft caramel center. To. Die. For. 

For a picky eater, I'm a big, big fan! Also great for grabbing a tea of espresso! Yay for Venezuelan food!"}
{"text":"Awesome arepas!

Pricey, however filling. 

Definitely will visit again. It seems like really good drunk food."}
{"text":"Walked into here randomly, but I already had read about this place briefly on yelp before.

The vibe as soon as I walked in was warm, I enjoyed it.

I ordered the carne mechada arepa and although flank steak already is a tough meat I found the steak very very very very dry and hard to chew. It' was unnaturally shredded/dry. I don't think it's a good idea to shred flanksteak. I almost choked on the meat.

With that being said, the flavour was not there either. Maybe it had been laying there for a while, maybe it was from yesterday.. i'm not sure.. 

The actual arepa and the sauces are what makes this place amazing though.

The arepa is perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.. the garlic mayo, cilantro sauce and hot sauce are deeeeelicious.. 

the cabbage they serve on the side is tasteless without the garlic mayo doused on top

A+ for serving sauce on the side 

the filling is what makes a sandwich and i was disappointed with it. but i will go back again to try something else. so i'll hopefully change my review then."}
{"text":"This place is more of a snack or lunch spot don't plan for filling up if you are hungry hungry. The arepas are great but the apps were a bit pricey for what it is, like $7.50 for cassava it was delicious but damn. They give you three sauces bell pepper, mayo and hot sauce(i put the mayo and hot sauce on everything!) I would definitely go back if i was in the area and not really hungry but skip the apps and stick with the arepas."}
{"text":"Arepas are Venezuelan comfort food (apparently). Having never visited Venezuela and admittedly being ignorant of Venezuelan life I took the internet's word for this definition. One item that did seem fairly obvious, upon learning of arepas, is that there are several common variations but not much as far as being vegetarian. This had always been a bit of a deal breaker for me.
Arepa Cafe on Queen however, turns this misinformation upside down and knocks it out of the park on delicious comfort food and includes several vegetarian options. Updated j learning this it was clear I had to get my butt down here and eat their food. Arepas Cafe did not disappoint either! Everything was prepared quickly and arrived fresh and while not complicated by any measure it was simplicity done very right, while incorporating some foods I wouldn't always have available - such as a cornmeal bun and fried plaintain.
Bonus points for the cool vibe. They were busy but everything felt the perfect combination of easy going and attentive.
Double bonus points for the homemade garlic mayo and hot sauces. While I'm not typically a fan of mayo this stuff was bursting with garlicky goodness and is a perfect addition."}
{"text":"Excellent low key restaurant. Very clean inside, friendly staff, awesome food, and good prices. It's a must try !!!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with a group of work friends based on a recommendation from some fellow foodie friends. 

First off, let me start of saying I've never had Venezuela food before so I really had no idea what to expect. I looked to fellow Yelp members for their reviews and they had rated it pretty good (avg. 4 star) so I was excited to try it out. 

The restaurant is clean, modern and \"fresh\" when you walk in. The exposed bricks and party pictures around Arepa give it a cool and young atmosphere. We had 9 people in our party and were easily accommodated (we did call ahead though to make sure). The waiter was polite and our water glasses were always being topped up. 

For drinks I decided to try the sugar cane lemonade it was AMAZING! Soo good. It wasn't your typical lemonade as it tasted more like half and half (that being half lemonade half iced tea). Will go back even for the drink ! lol

As for lunch I ordered la llanera-beef tenderloin, avocado, fresco cheese, tomato. It was good but the cheese really threw me off. I was not a huge fan. However that being said, the arepera was actually pretty good, much better then I was expecting. The small side of coleslaw that came with the meal was very good and light, and I never really like or eat coleslaw.

I gave it a 3 star because while it was good and I really enjoyed my lemonade, the cheese in the la llanera made my stomach feel off for a while and I felt super full (not in a good way) all day. While the rest of my table said their meals were good, I would not order the la llanera again.

P.S. I posted a pic of the la llanera"}
{"text":"I was thrilled to find a place that serves arepas as it's been so many years since I've had one.  The place has a nice casual ambiance and the service, while somewhat confused at times, was polite and friendly.  The food overall was solid.  I had the adobo roasted pork arepa with caramelized onions and it came with a small cole slaw and some sort of mashed avocado mixture (I don't think it was guacamole as it tasted like it had mayonnaise in it - I could be wrong about that though).  The pork was juicy and tender but it could've been a little hotter in terms of both the temperature and spice-metre.  But our server gave us 3 sauces for the latter: garlic mayonnaise, green pepper, and habanero.  I tried both the green pepper and habanero and both were great, the habanero packed quite a punch.  My only real complaint about the food was with the arepa itself as I prefer my arepas to be slightly thin and a bit more crispy.  But that's just a personal preference as I know many who prefer theirs to be plumper and softer.  But even if, the arepa itself wasn't terribly hot as it was kind of lukewarm.  Who knows though, maybe that's just another personal preference but I prefer to eat arepas a bit hotter than lukewarm.  

My friend had the americano coffee with her arepa and she said it was incredible.  We were going to try one of their desserts but didn't in the end.  Looking back, I wish we did because they looked fantastic in the display.  The prices are a bit high for what's basically Venezuelan street food but nothing overly outrageous.  Overall, I'd say this place is a nice addition to the food scene in Toronto."}
{"text":"Authentic food. The Arepas are nice size and the flavor very very very good. The Tequeños are delicious. If you are looking for a good Venezuelan restaurant this is the one for you."}
{"text":"Roomy space. Good service and friendly staff. The food is quite pricey for the portion they served but expected for anything on Queen West. The arepas were delicious and unexpectedly filling. I had the chorizo and egg arepa and wished that they put more chorizo in there. They had a super spicy orange condiments for all you spicy lovers.

They do Ritual btw."}
{"text":"With an extensive arepas menu I will need to come back often to try them all but the two I had were fantastic (ESP 'Queen'). Wish there was apple pay but they take debit so on a bike pit stop it was great"}
{"text":"Really good selection of quality Arepas in a fun part of town. The tequenos are a must, as is anything that has avocado. For a place that is more a lunch or snack venue, the service could be faster, however the servers are very pleasant."}
{"text":"Went here twice during my stay in Toronto. I had the Llanera beef arepa and my friend had the pulpo arepa and both were absolutely amazing. The steak was perfectly done and the octopus was marinated in a citrusy-sauce. Their herb-maya is fantastic. 
If you aren't full after the arepa, try the tres leches cake. You won't regret it! 
Thought little pricy but worth a visit and the staff is super nice!"}
{"text":"I love the food here! My staple is the pabellon (vegetarian) but for the first time I tried their hot chocolate to go and it was so good I actually came back to tell them and order another to take home to my husband. Seriously the BEST hot chocolate I've ever had. And I got it with almond milk. I am always hesitant to order hot chocolate because most are watered down and too sweet. This was all chocolate and all divine."}
{"text":"I was starving, so I saw this Arepa Café and got in just wanting some food, it was a great choice! I had the 2nd arepa on the menu, it was really good, great choice."}
{"text":"when one door closes, another opens

I woke up on the Saturday of the long weekend really happy.  My sister and I were heading to BMB aka Banh Mi Boys.  So you can imagine my disappointment when I walked by it and saw that it was closed for \"kitchen repairs\". Tear.

I dried my eye and messaged The Scotsman for ideas of where to go.  He suggested Arepa.  I'd never been but I was down with \"Venezuelan urbanity\".

Arepa Café is a Queen West joint that's urban hipster meets chic café.  It's bright, narrow and casual.  An arepa is traditional Venezulean comfort food of homemade cornmeal pockets stuffed with stuff.  And at Arepa, they are generous in their stuffing.

Their menu is pretty extensive, but as I looked around, it seemed most people were munching on an arepa of one kind or another.

My stuff was adobo roasted pork ($8.50).  Flavourful and meaty.  The Scotsman ordered the pabellon (shredded flank steak, black beans, sweet plantains, mozzarella, $9.75).  And my sister (accidentally, I say accidentally because she meant to get what the Scotsman) ordered the vegetarian option.  When hungry our brains only use the minimal amount of energy necessary for average cognitive functioing.  Put another way, we not so smart. 

I should warn you - their hot sauce is hot.  Think throat closing, mouth on fire, red-face hot.  It's no joke.  I made the mistake of thinking it was and slapped it all over my arepa.  

The three of also shared empanadas. Big mistake - it was weird.  Slightly sweet and a dry bland filling.  But again, I was hungry so not so smart. There is still no empanada that holds a candle to Las Palmas.

Overall the arepas were delicious, very filling, and messy.  Since I'm not one to shy away from a mess I would go back, but I would definitely skip the empanadas.  Sidebar: If it hadn't been for the empanadas, I would have likely given this place 4 stars.  And don't yell at me for being an empanada snob - I dare you to go eat at Las Palmas and tell me otherwise.  Double dare."}
{"text":"I was roaming downtown around the Queen Street West area and came by this place. It looked cute and nice from the outside and so I decided to give it a try. I went here on a Monday at around 6-7:30pm and it wasn't that busy. I was seated pretty quickly and didn't have to wait long for a server to come take care of us. 
I looked at the menu only to realize that I was at a Venezuelan restaurant which was a first for me. Never tried any type of Venezuelan food before which made me more excited to try the food. The food seemed simple and leaned more so on the healthy side. For the most part, the prices for the each item was averaging around $15 or less. 
I tried the la catira. It came with chicken breast, shredded cheese, mayo and tomatoe (I might be missing some other ingredient which I can't remember) with a small spoon of coleslaw. 

My opinion: the coleslaw didn't taste the greatest. Definitely was not creamy as I thought it would be. They put a ton of shredded cheese so I had to take some/most of it off. What made this sandwich was the sauces our waitress provided us with. The green pepper sauce, garlic mayo which is their most popular and the hot sauce -- where only a little bit of hot sauce will go a long way (and this is coming from a person who is from India). 

Would I come back? 
No, although it was interesting to try, I don't think I would want to. I feel like the food was pretty enteric like you could get anywhere. The flavour was okay but nothing to rave about. 

Why I gave it four stars and not 3 or less?
Because of the sauces"}
{"text":"My belly was bursting with joy after eating here! I never took notice of this place as I've rode my bike past it countless times but it's on my radar now. 
Staff were friendly and told me how to pronounce \"pabellon\" (my memory is as good as my ability to master a foreign language). I ordered the Pabellon Veggie Arepa (avocado, beans, cheese and sweet plantain) and split the tequeno (stuffed cheese pastry) with my friend. The arepa doesn't look that large but it's quite filling. I thought the arepa would crumble apart since it was made with corn but it had more of a texture of an english muffin (not  the same taste though). 
They provide you with an herb mayo, green mild sauce and a hot sauce. That mayo concoction added a nice flavour to the sandwich. 
The tequeno's are like a wad of cheese wrapped in pilsbury dough. They were delicious!
This was all washed down with a mill street organic beer. The meal and drinks came to about $22. Not too shabby!"}
{"text":"While I agree that the staff were extremely friendly, the service quick, and the decor wonderful, the food itself was horrible. I paid over $11 for a can of coke and an English-muffin sized cornbread bun filled with schredded chicken (looked more like tuna, actually) and traces of cheddar cheese. It was akin to an Egg McMuffin from McDonald's, except that those are priced accordingly. A total disappointment especially after such anticipation."}
{"text":"Arepa is one of our favourite places to hit up for a weekend brunch/lunch. 
It's named after the dish: an arepa is a Venezuelan (and Columbian) flatbread made from ground cornmeal filled with all different kinds of filling. Basically a sandwich (gluten and dairy free) made from corn.

We've been going for years and while there have been times that the filling didn't seem as generous as it could be, it's now settled into providing huge portions that leaves no one feeling hungry. We've tried so much of the menu and really you can't go wrong- just pick whatever filling you most want and go with it.

Things can get a bit slow, especially when it's busy. Very much recommended - I've taken most of my family and friends to Arepa at one point or another!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for Venezuelan/Latin American food this is the place to go. I love the arepas here, and of course the taqueños!  The staff is friendly, the sauce is spicy and the price is right."}
{"text":"Woke up this morning around 10:30 and decided to go grab breakfast.  Where to go around Queen and Denison?  We decided to go to Shanghai Cowgirl, as they have an all-day breakfast menu.

Well, it turns out SC doesn't open until 11:30 a.m.  Not super helpful.  Now as we wandered back, defeated, I saw Arepa and said, \"I've always wanted to try this place, let's go look.\"

Inside, the place was empty, but we were greeted warmly by a man who asked if we wanted breakfast.  He handed us a menu and told us to sit anywhere.  Within seconds, a female server arrived with two glasses of water and a hug pitcher for the table.  

We ordered coffees (cappuccino for me, Americano for him) and each had an arepa - although neither from the breakfast section after all.  Mine was shredded beef in a sweet bbq sauce, with plantains and beans - delicious! The sauces come on the side, so if you don't like sauce, it's perfect.  My dining companion had the steak with avocado and cheese - also good, but mine was better.  

Service was always pleasant.  It's a wee bit expensive but it was filling enough that I didn't feel ripped off.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very excited to discover a place with Venezuelan food, while walking along Queen st. I must say that this place is one thats worth trying, even if you've never heard of an arepa. Service here was good, not spectacular; food took a little long for my liking (about 20min), but staff was very helpful for our first time. Thr venue otself was nicely decorated and spacious, and a big open window for a nice breeze on a hot summer day. 

Now for the food itself. We got the ceviche and green plantains to start, and both were amazing. The ceviche had a very powerful sweet and acidic taste, and the plantains were crisp and had tje typical plantain bitterness that complements any type of sauce (they also give you 3 different sauces to go with your food). The arepas themselves were also very good. Some of my group said theirs were a little dry but mine (the pabellon arepa) was not. But all had a unique flavour and were very filling. 

All in all, this is a place that I would love to explore more of. They had a large menu, that is very reasonably priced (9-15 per dish). Definetely reccomend and will be returning."}
{"text":"Very yummy chicken sandwiches with alot of avacado and a really nice bread. The fried Casava with guacamole, and three different sauces was also tremendous."}
{"text":"I swear, this place surprised me to no end! What an amazing and adorable place. I enjoyed the vegetarian pablito sandwich (aged cheddar, tomatoes, avocados, demi-baguette, done in a panini press) and had a white gazpacho on the side. The white gazpacho was nice, cooling on a hot day. The servers are fabulous and kind, and I loved the hot sauce on the side! So good. I've been back at least 10 times since the first time I went last year. 

Love the free-wifi, the great decor (funky and awesome - the wall art is just so hip, speaks to the area). I love it in the summer when they open up the front and you can sit next to the street and people watch."}
{"text":"Wandered into this wonderful place in Toronto called Arepa Café with my wife and daughter and decided to have the daily special, Pork Loin arepas with a mango glaze and the fresh tomato gazpacho that was served with a half an arepa on the side. The food was delicious. There were hints of cilantro and balsamic vinegar in the gazpacho that gave it a sweet and tangy flavor that was simply sublime. And arepa was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside which delivered a clean corn flavor to my taste buds. The pork was perfectly cooked and well matched with the mango glaze. I washed it all down with a local IPA craft beer. If you ever fund yourself in Toronto, do yourself a favor and stop by Arepa Café. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great little gem. The arepa is quite filling. Love the sauces especially the hot sauce, it packs a huge punch."}
{"text":"Stick with the basics here, the Arepas are great (carne mechada and chicken are our faves), the Emepanadas are good."}
{"text":"Amazing dessert like nothing I've ever had before. I think it was called tres leches, and with my poor translation that's either very milky or triple milk... either works :)  Anyway that dessert was like a sweet bread pudding with a marshmallow-like topping. 

The dinner platter had steak and sausage, neither of which I was quite fond of. We weren't even asked how we like our steak cooked, and it came well done. Stick the the arepas, I guess."}
{"text":"Tried this place out while we happened to pass it while strolling by on queen. We ordered the first two items on the menus, I think chicken arepas. 
We had never had arepas before so we were unsure of what to expect. It's like a cornbread sandwich and is not heavy at all but so very filling. 

They were filled with chicken and avocado and my husband added beans to his. They were so good! 

The whole time we ate, we barely spoke because it was so delicious. We also ordered the empanadas, both chicken and beef were great. We highly recommend the sugar cane lemonade as well.
Nice casual place for a Sunday afternoon. Friendly service as well. We will definitely return and we both admitted we would crave these arepas."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place I found thanks to my fellow yelpers. I have passed this restaurant so many times without even realizing that it was there or the delicious menu that lay inside. I've never even heard of Venesuzlan sandwiches before. I had whatever it was that was first on the menu. Chicken. Avocado. Sold! The arepa was stuffed to the brim with the filling and the avocado, my absolute favourite, was generously mashed in. I was expecting a skimpy thin layer on the green stuff like most other places, and I was so pleasantly surprised. The creamy coleslaw on the side was a very nice touch. Hubby had the special of the day that happened to be flank steak. The man loves meat and even he was saying that the mount of shredded beef inside the delicious cornmeal bun was more than enough for him. He also loved the crazy hot orange spicy sauce that he finally admitted was actually very spicy, just the way he likes it. I adored the garlic sauce they had. So garlicky. So good! The chill atmosphere in the restaurant was very easy goung and made for a very relaxing experience."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and it was great both times.  I enjoyed the sirloin steak arepa much more than the cod one I had however, but that was just my taste.  Be warned-- these sandwiches are meaty.
Love the  green pepper sauce, I kept putting it on every bite of my arepa.  The food is very fresh here, good value for money, nice staff."}
{"text":"Very cute cafe.  Industrial chairs, minimalist decor.  As per Toronto protocol - bathroom downstairs.  Note that it is single washrooms and if you close the door behind you - it will automatically lock and you will need to get an employee to unlock it.

Back upstairs to the food.  My friend and I each had an arepa.  Small sandwiches packed with goodness slammed between cornmeal patties.  The side slaw is one of the best ones I have ever had.  Very flavourful.  Wish they gave me more than just a drop of it!  If you are really hungry, you are going to need to order one of their platters.  The arepas are small if your tummy is empty.

Be cautious with their red sauce that they will bring to the table.  The little wee sticker that said \"very hot\" was not noticed by my friend and I until after our faces were beet red, we were crying and fanning our faces.  I have had some hot stuff in my day, but oh dear god...this stuff is hell in a bottle.  Gillian K suggested it be called the mind eraser as we were in agony for about 10 minutes and could not remember what we were talking about beforehand.  That sauce should come with its own waiver.  I felt like I was punched in the face and my lips went numb.

Red sauce aside, I had a good time at Arepa and will be back to try one of their platters and dessert.  

Their coffee - really good - and hot - as it should be!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had Venezuelan food (to my knowledge...or memory), so I was excited to check out Arepa Cafe's highly-touted arepas... sandwiches made of cornmeal baked into pita-like tortillas stuffed with anything from pulled pork to octopus.

We split the Octopus arepa and Shredded Flank Steak arepa. 
I love octopus and this was done pefectly; not overcooked or too chewy. 
The shredded flank steak was almost perfect- very flavorful, tender and juicy. We wanted to check out a cheese (queso?)  arepa, but were suprised by how rich those 2 seemingly small arepas were. 

I laced my arepas with the red (habernero) and white (garlic) sauces. The green one was a little too grassy for me and i felt like a cow after tasting it with my yucca fries
I didn't think the red sauce was That spicy...certainly not to the extent of drowning yourselves with water as some other Yelpers have expressed. 
Besides, if you were a seasoned hot sauce user, you'd know that dunking water is the Worst solution if your mouth is burning...milk and bread, folks! Works every time!

We also shared a side of yucca fries. 
I usually really enjoy a plate of yucca fries...where I've had them crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. 
Disappointingly, these were not fluffy. 
They actually tasted a little undercooked? Not tasty.

We split an alfajores after inhaling our arepas;a cookie sprinkled with powdered sugar and stuffed with chocolate creme in the middle. It was lovely and although not huge, was satisfying after the 2 arepas. 

I'd ventured back to Arepa Cafe for lunch..."}
{"text":"Provided no customer service and charged my group of four 18% tip. Food was alright in my opinion wasnt worth the price. There are plenty of other restaurants on queen street."}
{"text":"We stopped by this Venezuelan cafe for a little snack during our stroll down Queen West. It's a great space - modern vintage with exposed brick, LED lighting, and an art display of paper airplanes hanging from the tall ceilings. The menus self-describe the cafe as a picture of Venezuelan urbanity.

We shared an arepa sampler, the perfect size for one person, but since we had been eating all day, we split them among 3 of us (2 vegetarian, 1 pork). Of course, the sauces that they give you make the arepa. In addition to our sampler, we had coffee (cortado for me) that was very strong. All the cookies that they have are vegan, and my favorite was the cashew cookie, very similar in flavor and texture to Chinese almond cookies! But fresher.

We sat here for a while resting and reading the paper. It's a great place to just relax and have a long conversation with a friend. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"A little bit of avocado heaven. 

Even with the positive reviews before mine, this was still a refreshing experience in so many ways. 

Freshly painted interior on Queen W? Very refreshing! 
Fresh-tasting avocado? Refreshing again! 
Friendly and efficient service. Three-times-a-refreshing! 
Clean restrooms? Quattro refresho. 
My bladder? Fiiiiive golden rings! 

This was my first sampling of an arepa and it was a pretty cool sensory experience. It's doughy and crunchy and buttery all at once. (Yes, refreshing). I'd like to dunk that bad boy into a big vat of gravy and go to town. 

And the arepa filling choices were aces all around. 

In the end, I was in for $16 for a beer, an arepa, tax and tip and that's alright in my books. My only beef: the portion size. I could easily tuck back three of them without blinking, so bring a second lunch if you're planning on eating here. That, or a big vat of gravy. 

Mmmm ... vat of gravy."}
{"text":"So I really like this place. Arepas were crispy on the outside, perfect amount of chewy, cheesy flavor. I had a trio, which I recommend. The meats were all fantastic, the black beans I wasn't a fan of (too sweet). Maybe it's a cultural thing? Great variety on the menu, custom and non.

We also had plantains split amongst the table, very well done (as in yummy) with fantastic dipping sauces. 

It did get crowded and they were a bit understaffed, so come during non-peak hours and wash it all down with a pretty tasty mixed drink or coffee.

I highly recommend checking it out.

NOTE: Yes, they're gluten free, but my friends, who are very sensitive to gluten, ordered items they were assured were cooked separately from the gluten-containing dishes. They were not and as result, they felt the effects. Sigh. Be careful people with celiacs!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for somewhere to eat we walked into Arepa knowing nothing about it.  No research, not even a look at the menu and it was a great choice. 

Two of us shared 4 dishes - some arepas and a couple of empenadas.  I remember some shredded beef and some grilled plantain.  And some perfectly ripe avocado.

Service was perfect as was the food.  

The spicy sauce is just that, very zingy and the rum drinks were generous.

I wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"This was the first time that I have ever tried Venezuelan food so I wasn't sure what to expect. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. I went with a couple of friends, and we decided to order a couple of things to share since we wanted to try everything.

For appetizers we tried the Tequenos, which is basically a pastry filled with cheese. When you have a deep fried pastry and melted cheese you can't go wrong. We also had the Cassava and Guasacaca, which are deep fried cassava fries. The fries had texture similar to puff pastry and were really yummy. The avocado sauce that accompanies the fries was delicious. The 3 sauces that come with the food were great too. I loved the hot sauce, which is quiet hot.

The mains we had were the Arepas, which are grilled corn meal bread sandwiches with different fillings. We tried the Adobo Roasted Pork, Pabellon Arepa, and Carne Mechada. My favourite had to be the Pabellon Arepa, which has shredded flank steak, black beans, sweet plantain, and cheese.

For dessert we had the Alfajor, which is a cookie with caramel filling sprinkled with powdered sugar. The great thing about this is that they weren't too sweet, and small enough that you can still eat a dessert after all the other food.

The atmosphere in the place is casual and urban. I love the artwork on the walls; there are some cool necklaces showcased. It's a great place to chat with your friends and hangout and I would definitely go back and visit."}
{"text":"It was a real treat to try something completely new to me: Venezuelan food.  I'm a fan and will definitely return for more as the Pabellon Arepa was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is the first place where I tried an arepa and I absolutely fell in love. The interior is cute and the Arepas are amazing. I can't wait to go back there to try more variety on the menu."}
{"text":"Yummy. These are so stuffed, they are good. They are not cheap, and they look small, but they are pretty packed in so it really is a small meal.
Delicious options, both meat and veg."}
{"text":"Great find in Toronto.  Authentic Venezuelan food and great service.  Has the mini-arepa sampler, which is great fun, and tostones."}
{"text":"Excellent Venezuelan food, everything very delicious. Service as well was very good."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the black bean avocado arepa - SO GOOD.
I'm a vegetarian, so cannot comment on the others. But this one is too good to switch up my order :)
Had the lemonade as well - quite sweet, but nice on a walk day of walking around"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service good. We tried the adobo arepa, Venezuelan chips (plantain), build-your-own platter with flank steak/fried plantains/tomato/avocado and sugarcane lemonade. The stand out was definitely the flank steak which paired excellently with fresh tomatoes. The arepa bread was fresh and crispy, made to order. 

The only downside was the price, as a small lemonade was almost $5 and a side order of tomatoes cost $3 but came with very few pieces. But then again, for queen street west, you can't expect much price-wise.

Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"When the Arepa Cafe first opened, I was invited by a good Venezuelan friend who makes her own arepas and raved about the Cafe's.  That was then. Not sure what happened during the past few months. Although the ambience is still upbeat and fun, the arepas were not quite the same.  Had a huge chunk of avocado with little else in my arepa. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for a Saturday or Sunday lunch. The food is always good and fresh. The staff are really friendly. Highly recommended the La Llanera."}
{"text":"Los he visitado un par de veces, mi recomendacion es 
Entrada: Tequeños / Patacones.
Main: Un Pabello Criollo.
Postre: Aun no he probado! :(
Bebida: Papelon!

Aunque si esta apurado y no tienes tanto tiempo.

Una Arepa de Pabellon y/o Una Reina Pepeada.
Con Un Papelon!"}
{"text":"I love when a place that could survive as a hole in the wall has amazing ambiance and elevates the experience. It doesn't take away from the authenticity of the food.  I only had room for a snack so I ordered the guarapita (passionfruit cocktail) and an order of tequeños, which are like a Venezuelan version of mozzarella sticks, but better.  They came with multiple amazing sauces. I couldn't finish them all (comes with 4), although now at 2:30 AM at the peak of my insomnia induced starvation, I am regretting throwing that last one away. There was a massive list of arepa filling choices and I hope I get the chance to come back and try one! There are definitely some interesting choices, however I appreciate the creativity.  It's always nice to have some vegetarian and seafood options for the non-meat eaters out there."}
{"text":"First off: they really need a new system for their front door.  This is Toronto, where it is cold for about 8 months of the year, so a door that opens freely into your restaurant where people are trying to enjoy their meals, doesn't quite work.  Luckily it wasn't too cold the night I visited - but seriously, a curtain, a double door, something.  

Other than the occasional interruption from the December wind, I really enjoyed this place.  I was a little worried when I heard this was where we would be having our most recent dining group meeting, because I'm not usually a big fan of cornbread.  Something about it...the vague sweetness perhaps?  It just doesn't mesh well for me.  I decided to be bold anyways, and order one of their arepas rather than a platter.  We also got an order of Tequenos to share, which were cheese pastries.  They were basically mozzarella sticks, but with a very different pastry, and I believe they were baked.  They were served with a green pepper sauce, which was quite tasty even though I don't like green peppers (I swear, I'm not a super picky eater!)  I would definitely get that again.  In fact, I'm pretty curious about all of their appetizers.  

I chose the Pabellon steak arepa, which came stuffed full of meat and black beans.  With the garlic sauce and the green pepper sauce, it was very tasty.  The hot sauce though...I love spicy.  But this stuff was lethal - it actually had a \"warning\" label on it!  I tried just a drop on one bite, and I still felt the heat.  I didn't find that it had much of a flavour though, which is what I like spice for.  The other girls were quite happy with theirs as well, although the one person who had been there before preferred her previous choice of the veggie pabellon to the la llanera she had this time.  

I also had the dulce de leche cheesecake, but I was a little disappointed.  I love cheesecake, but I like creamy, rich cheesecake.  This was the crumbly variety, which just doesn't do it for me.  I wished I had ordered the plantain dessert that one of my friends ordered a little later, or had one of the stuffed cookies.  

I have to talk about the server.  She was a very nice girl, but really shouldn't be a server.  She didn't offer advice or even the dishes of the day.  She couldn't keep any of the orders straight when she was delivering them, including the cheesecake even though I was the only one who ordered dessert at that time!  Three ordered beer and one didn't, she gave a beer to the one who didn't.  And when we went up to pay, she was splitting the bills right there with us telling her what we each had.  But she still mixed them up, and we had to make up the differences between ourselves because she really just didn't GET that she wasn't getting it.  She wasn't rude by any means, and she wasn't apologetic, she was just completely unaware.  It took us about 20 minutes for 4 people to pay.  

All in all: really tasty generous arepas, yummy appetizers, disappointing cheesecake, and completely aloof service.  Considering the low price point, I enjoyed the food enough that I'll definitely be back again.

I should mention: the arepas, while delicious, are not easy to eat.  Definitely not a place for a first date!"}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to Venezuelan food and this is where she takes me. I love it, I had the platter and it's wonderful. It's filling and delicious. I recommend the mozzarella cheese sticks, it's the bomb! They also serve  drinks and wine. They also have mini arepas to try. Staff are nice and very welcoming. Also, brunch is till 4PM."}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing, if you live in TO and you love sandwiches, look no further.

Had Reina pepiada and watercress salad, delicious!

Thank me later!"}
{"text":"Over $10 for this... that's just sad. The arepas are normally great, but this is a massive let down."}
{"text":"Let me start with the service: very friendly and helpful. And they were very sweet to our little girl.

We ordered the chicken empanadas and tostones to start. The flavor of the empanada filling was good, although we felt there was a bit too much masa. The tostones were good, although they were slightly more done than we would like. There wasn't that bit of chew we were expecting towards the center; it was all crispy--but not greasy. And we enjoyed the guacamole that came with it. 

The red sauce was quite spicy, which was nice. The garlic mayo was good. The green sauce we did not enjoy. It was bitter. I think a traditional mild verde (tomatillo) sauce would serve them better. 

I had the pork with tomatoes. The pork was good. I had thought it would have a bit more sauce, and flavor, to it. But the mayo and guacamole helped with that. The tomatoes were mealy and not an improvement. My husband had the carne mechada which he thought was fine. Overall our feeling was that it was a lot of meat and felt like it could use some vegetables or something.

Now on to the alafjors. These are wonderful. If you enjoy caramel or dulce de leche, these are not to be missed. Five stars for these!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Loved this place!  This food is different and delicious!  They have dishes that aren't common everywhere which was a nice change of pace.  Don't forget to try the garlic mayo.  If I'm ever back in Toronto I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm ready to come back anytime! What's an Arepa? A latin american snack (that can become a small meal), of goodness slapped between two crispy corn flour crunchy things. Okay, I don't know much about the food, but I can tell you it was awesome. 

Not the neatest thing to eat, as I bit into my avocado filled roasted chicken Arepa, and it spewed out the side of my side mouth, causing me to wipe after each bite, and hoping my DP didn't judge me. She too was reaching for a napkin every so often. There were lots. 

I forgot to add the three different sauces they gave me! I have to go back. 

It's a nice cafe, open, and big - with a garage door that I assume would let some summer air in. I could spend longer time here. Lots of nice looking cakes in the window too. 

I like places like this. So much on the menu, and I want to try more. There's more than just Arepas."}
{"text":"The arepas are pretty good here. The first time I tried an arepa was at the Caracas Arepa Bar in the East Village Manhattan and they were so mouthwateringly delicious, greasy and crispy and sooo filling from such a tiny little sandwich. I was addicted. I can't help but compare the Arepa Cafe to this place. I thought the arepas at Arepa Cafe a little modest and dry. One day I'll have to try them in Venezuela."}
{"text":"It's certainly the most refined Arepa I've ever had. It's not bad by any means, but I was hoping for something a bit more soulful and perhaps cheaper. 
The staff are super nice. They took my order, and brought me my food quite quickly. 

I got the steak arepa - which was very good. I've had better ones with more flavour, but if you are looking for something fresh and simple - I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"I ordered the la pelua which had the flank steak topped with shredded cheddar (10.5). As simple as that sounds, the flavour was popping. The corn meal bread was soft while the steak was well seasoned. What I also loved about this place is the place itself! It had great decor and very comfortable vibe. Lastly, arepa cafe had a good selection of beverages. Definitely try the guava juice (5.8) or the house mojito(12)."}
{"text":"I am a regular here and bring as many people as possible to experience the deliciousness. 

I used to live in Colombia where their arepas are slightly different. When I first walked in I realized that these Venezuelan arepas would be *stuffed*! I have been back like a dozen times since. 

To back up a little, an arepa is a corn cake, and then at this cafe they'll add things to it. Usually along the lines of cheese, avocado, beans and sweet plantains. (Actually that is the contents of precisely my favourite arepa - the vegetarian Pabellon.) 

They offer them up with various sauces (I die for the garlic mayo) and you can also order fresh juices which are the perfect companion to an arepa. 

For first timers, arepas are quite filling. Come with an appetite!

Also, this is a judgement free zone. Sometimes the arepas are so stuffed they are hard to eat. But totally worth the mess! 

The staff is also super lovely and helpful here, whether you eat in or dine out. I'll probably be a regular here as long as I live in Toronto. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? For reals? I've eaten 4 arepas here this week. They're heavenly... Run, don't walk. Texture is unbelievable, they're gluten free, and you feel comfortably full after devouring the packed (!) corny package of avocado/chicken/queso happiness"}
{"text":"Not many people are aware of Venezuelan cuisine but man this place is great! The service is on point and the restaurant has a nice laid back atmosphere to it as well. The arepas are always fresh and really filling. My go to is the carne mechada - it might be a little non-adventurous for some, but it's loaded with beef and when combined with the three house sauces (salsa verde, garlic, and hot sauce), it's amazing. Would also recommend getting the sweet plantains, empanadas, or tequeños if you want any side dishes. Love this place and am so glad that there is a good Venezuelan restaurant downtown!"}
{"text":"I expected to be blown away by the $10+ price tag for my chicken avocado arepa. The presentation was sloppy, the avocado chicken mixture was brown in colour and the arepa (or something they spread on it) was ridiculously salty. Since I took my sandwich as takeout, I'm venting my disappointment here. This was my first and last visit to this mediocre establishment. If there are amazing arepa sandwiches anywhere in Toronto, I'd love to know about it. I'm missing the arepas at Sabor Latina in Montreal. Their authentic Columbian homemade goodness puts the fast food at Arepa Cafe to shame."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Toronto.

I love the Arepa's and the alfajores, nothing better in my opinion.

Fantastic, also very friendly and the lady with the tattoos is really pretty."}
{"text":"Great food and drink. Had the chorizo and egg and was blown away, so good! Definitely will come again!"}
{"text":"Really disappointing food for the price you pay. Food quality was pretty average . My husband ordered the fish arepa and the fish was too salty/ chewy (not a good choice of fish for an arepa which is already chewy) and I ordered the pabellon vegetarian - which was really basic and nothing special. Their sauces were just OK too. I was really looking forward to trying arepa Café but am disappointed - we definitely won't be coming back"}
{"text":"As a venezuelan I can say that this place is amazing, the tequeños are the best ones I have tried in my life (not as good as the actual Venezuelans).
Arepas are amazing, would recommend the reina pepeada.
Don't leave without trying the tres leches or quesillo"}
{"text":"King of a flight waiter, but we didnt let him effect our ex
Experience  
I had a Venezuelan mojito.  Yum!!  I loved that they used lemons instead of just lime.  It was very tasty.
We shared The curvy queen and Domino.  Really loved the curvy queen--highly recommend this, as you see from other reviews too.  The domino was disappointing for David because this was his favorite arepa growing up and he remembers it differently.  The beams are a bit on the sweet side, I admit.
We shared cachapas with quest fresco.  Good, but not cooked enough.  Either way, I was thrilled to finally try the closest we've had so far to Venezuelan food.  I'd do it again!"}
{"text":"We had delicious vegetarian arepas, tasty plantains and the tres leches cake - can't get any tastier! Also, the staff was super friendly, helpful and accommodating."}
{"text":"I order the exact same each time I visit, this time the Llanera Arepa came with chorizo and beef. As someone who tries to avoid pork I wasn't thrilled, but as the wait was 25 mins for the meal I didn't want to send it back and have to wait any longer as my friend was in a hurry to eat and leave. When the bill came there was an additional $4.50 charge for the chorizo. I advised the waitress who I believe was the owner of this error, and she claimed I asked for Chorizo. Completely false as I didn't want pork in the first place. She was unwilling to accept that it was her misunderstanding, no apologies at all, and in the end I paid the extra charge for her mistake. Completely disappointed, will never return."}
{"text":"Arepa cafe is a fantastic spot for a hearty lunch. 
The arepa are all loaded with steak or chicken or sausage, even fish. All cooked fresh to order and placed in this special sandwich with delicious fresh fillings like tomato, lettuce, onion, avocado, and cheese. 

Accompanied by a plethora of adult beverages to please anyone."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to Arepas generally, and this place doesn't disappoint.  I'm pescetarian, but this time I had the vegetarian one with plantains in it. I'm curious about the fish one -other places I've had fish it's been not so flavorful, so I went for one with a nice combination of fillings. It was pretty tasty! I love the arepa \"bread\" - kind of like a cross between a tortilla and a pita, made from corn it's chewy and grainy with a nice crust.

I had a fresh juice which was tasty but a little expensive - but the arepa was moderately priced so it worked out ok. I didn't have dessert but the baked goods looked nice.

Very nice vibe in there.service was very friendly and chill. Even though they were closing, they didn't rush me at all.  I wish they were open later!"}
{"text":"Having never had an arepa before, this was quite the nice experience! The service was friendly and had a very genuine edge to it, as if the people there were really excited to be serving arepas to us. My arepa was perfectly warm and filled to the brim with cheese, avocado, and beans. I loved it! I'm not usually a fan of beans but they were cooked to just the right texture -- not too soft. The three accompanying sauces they provided -- garlic and hot sauces, I believe -- were also delicious and I had a good time dabbing just a little hot sauce onto each bite. 

I think the hardest part of the meal was just trying to be neat while I ate! I would definitely go back. It's not very expensive and the meal will fill you up. (I'd also suggest grabbing some alfajores for the road when you leave.)"}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't left a review of this place yet because it is definitely one of my favourite places to go in the city! 

The variety of arepas you can order is amazing. I try to make sure to order a different one every time I come (but the carne asada is always a good choice). Everything is made fresh and comes to you piping hot. I usually also order the tostones (deep fried plantains) as either a side or an appetizer. The three sauces they give you are great to use especially the garlic mayo. Warning: when they tell you that the hot sauce is hot... it is! 

Note: Bathrooms are not accessible because they are downstairs."}
{"text":"On a day where I was thinking \"this world needs more avocado\" I discovered The Curvy Queen: It's basically an avocado chicken salad - emphasis on the avocado that replaces the mayo in a chicken salad. Heaped between a Venezuelan pita made of corn meal, you have yourself one sando that any gluten-free warrior would be happy to call their lunch. And it is huge. A suggested way to eat said sammy: first forkfuls, then, for the brave, bite in. Servers bring three salsas table side. The two I tried were habenaro and cilantro. 

A tip for the lemonade lovers amongst us, don't skimp on the cane sugar lemonade. It's divine."}
{"text":"Very tasty arepas!! I really enjoyed each bite. It has a lot varieties. Very friendly staffs. Very good place to come with friends and family. Muy Rica La Comida aqui."}
{"text":"Went here for a group dinner. It was a nice experience. The service was great. Staff were friendly and made great recommendations. The food was delicious. The salads were fresh with excellent dressings. The arepas  were very tasty and we recommend getting dessert. I ordered a subpar caesar, which was the only downer in the whole experience."}
{"text":"First time trying arepas and I enjoyed it. The place is pretty casual although there is table service.

I ordered the Pulpo arepa: octopus, sweet pepper, onion, coriander, and lemon. Pretty tasty and messy to eat. For dessert, I had the tres leches sponge cake which was super rich and satisfying. 

Definitely pricey given the portion size though. The arepa on it's own was $13.25 and you need an appetizer and/or dessert to be satisfied."}
{"text":"The restaurant look is good, clean, modern, and well presented, now, the food: we had some very good Tequeños (cheese stuffed bread sticks) , then followed by one Arepa with stake, tomatoes, cheese, and avocado (avocado was bad, it had black spots, I asked for a replacement and got a very thin slice of \"green\" avocado,\"green\" as in not ripe.) my wife had the Pabellón diner plate which had Shredded Flank stake (extremely salty, she has lo blood pressure and normaly eats with extra salt, this was very salty for her), slice of ripe plaintain (not fully cooked), beans (plain seasonings), rice (served two times, first uncooked and burnt at the same time, second just undercooked). All this with a soda and a beer was with tip $56, which i can tell you is a lot of money for that, we are Colombian and Venezuelan and we know what takes to make it, we have also visited othe Latin restaurants that serve this food, and they are a lot better for a fraction of the price. Not likely to go again, maybe for the Tequeños."}
{"text":"Got two arepas (La Sifrina $10: roasted chicken, avocado, red onion, coriander with cheddar cheese and Llanera $11.95: grilled beef tenderloin, avocado, fresco cheese tomato) delivered using Foodora. Seems like it is not just me based on other reviews. It is pricey. If you get one arepas with a side (one arepa will be not enough) and a drink, it can cost close to $20 with tax and tip included. 

Taste? there was NO roasted chicken in my La Sifrina. Just cold chicken cubes bedded in mushy avocado (I am assuming red onion and coriander are in this mush? but I could not taste either of these two ingredients). There was way too much cheddar cheese (yes, I never thought I would be complaining about having too much cheese in my food). All I could taste was cheddar cheese and just mushiness from avocado) Can't believed I paid $15 including tax, delivery fee and tip for the driver. One arepa was about 13cm in diameter (not too big, I had to snack on some chips after). They give you three different sauces: two hot sauce and one creamy sauce and coleslaw (literally one bite). If I didn't have these sauces, I wouldn't have been able to finish mine. That's how tasteless my La Sifrina was. 

Llander was slightly better except it was still way over-priced. Not much flavor in the meat either.

Overall, do not recommend this place. I would rather get fast-food."}
{"text":"I've never tried Venezuelan food, but I'm glad I did. I've been to this place twice now and I think it'll become a favourite of mine. 

An arepa is essentially a cornbread flatbread, filled with various things- vegetarian or non. I chose the Domino, which was just black beans and cheese. While it sounds kind of boring, it's actually really good, especially when you have it with their sauces. When you order an arepa, they give you 3 bottles of sauces: garlic mayo, green pepper, and a hot sauce (be forewarned, it's really hot, so just a drop or two will do!) The arepa comes served with a small side of coleslaw, which I find helps to cool down my mouth after having some hot sauce. The arepa may look small at first, but it's actually pretty filling. It's also really messy to eat, especially if you have multiple fillings in it. (My bf ordered the Carne Mechada, which was pretty much overflowing with meat and vegetables, the cornbread pocket didn't seem to hold all the fillings well).


They also have some sides that you can order, my favourite so far being the green plantain tostones. They come served with a side of garlic mayo. I've also seen some platters and desserts listed on the menu, but I haven't tried any of those yet."}
{"text":"Delicious- service was charming, food was cooked to perfection, reasonably priced & fantastic flavors.  I have a gluten allergy & the staff was super-knowledgable and almost everything on the menu was GF- a wonderful treat!"}
{"text":"Solid arepas and great vegetarian options across the menu.  Lots of attention to freshness and flavor.  Sauces at the table were great as well.  With the time and I recommend, especially for lunch."}
{"text":"My first and definitely not my last visit to arepa cafe. Grabbing a quick take out lunch, the first bites of my cornmeal vegetarian sandwich were fantastic. It came with four small containers of which I was excited to try...WARNING!!! Be wary of the red sauce and use sparingly. I love pepper and hot but I think this is concentrated habanero!! The food was full of flavour and the service was nice and reliable given how busy it was at the time. A second visit is a must for me and friends next time."}
{"text":"Started out for lunch with all intentions of hitting up TO's newest burger addition, Oh Boy, only to discover they were not flipping the patties due to a technical glitch with their grill. So we crossed the street to the other newest addition to this section of Queen Street, the Arepa Cafe. It opened only yesterday so that means I'm scooping the FTR on this joint! 

The menu at Arepa is focused on Venezuelan food so we just went with the flow. My SO and I ordered up a couple of Arepas which are the Venezuelan version of a sandwich. They look like a large English muffin and are made of corn meal. They are cooked on a griddle, then moved to a grill and then slit open, pulled apart and stuffed like a pocket. I ordered the pork & caramelized onions and my SO ordered the Cod with sweet peppers & onions. There are about 9 or so options of how you can have your Arepa stuffed from Tuna to Chicken to Cheese & Avocado. The Arepa is hot and freshly made to order and the average price is about $7 each. 

For the most part we enjoyed them although I would have liked some condiments on the tables because my pork and onion sandwich was screaming out for a splash of Kozlik's mustard or something comparable. My other comment would be that they would really do the Arepa justice to side it with something, either some salad or some Venezuelan cole slaw (which is on the menu) because if you have any sort of appetite you'll be left wanting for more. Which is exactly what we found.  The Arepa comes in a basket all by its lonesome self.  It needs something to keep it company.  

We also ordered a platter (all the proper Venezuelan names of the platters etc. is escaping my brain!) of flank steak with rice, black beans and fried plantain. The flank steak was delicious. It was shredded and mixed with some red & yellow peppers, onions and some sort of sauce. The only problem with it was there just wasn't enough of it. This platter was $11 and like the Arepa, my SO and I agreed, these were small servings. 

My feelings about Venezuelan food is that it doesn't have the flavour pop of Thai or Indian foods. I like food with an attitude and I'm not just talking about heat, but foods that have truly distinct flavours that make you close your eyes and brings on the mmmmmmmm factor. The shredded flank steak was there but its meager portion disappointed us. The soup of the day was a butternut squash with honey and almonds. I didn't try it but I did ask the couple next to me about it and they really liked it. It did look like it had the consistency of a veloute. 

The cafe itself is lovely. Bright, airy, spacious and spotless. The staff were super friendly and quite chatty. They also have some lovely little desserts and coffee which might make this a sweet spot for an afternoon cafe leche and something to tame the sweet tooth. I brought back some cookies for my office which were like two layers of thin shortbread with Dulce La Leche slathered in between holding them together. These were exquisite. 

Pics to follow. I'd like to wish Eduardo Lee all the best at their introduction to what he calls \"Venezuelan urbanity\" to the Queen Street core."}
{"text":"Had their beef tenderloin arepa and I really love how they use fresh slices of avocado. The combination of textures is really good and I like how they don't over season the fillings as it gives me the opportunity to douse my arepa with their amazing garlic mayo. FYI - they give each table three sauces (a crazy hot sauce, my fav garlic mayo and a green sauce which I can't recall what's in it but it contains a lot of herbs) for you to use at your heart's desire.  We also ordered their cheese pastries, which were like mozzarella sticks and their cassava pieces (the latter was not that impressive).  Wasn't impressed with their guava cheesecake though - wasn't smooth at all and absolutely no guava flavour."}
{"text":"This place is so, so good. The arepas, the tequeños, and the lemonade is amazing. Makes me miss Toronto."}
{"text":"Being from Venezuela, this place brings back childhood memories, just fancier and cleaner, authentic in taste.

The coffee is smooth... Arepas are stuffed with goodness... Queso Fresco, one of my favourite cheese!... and Malte Polar, which is like a malt soda... *drool*

I love how many variations of arepas they serve here. The desserts are great too! Prices are not exactly cheap, considering arepas in Venezuela are like \"doughnuts\" in Toronto, you can pick them up in the corner neighborhood cafe. 

I would definitely go back. Yum!"}
{"text":"This the 2nd arepa place in Toronto and the first formal sit down restaurant. The other one is in Kensington Market - a typical treat as I do my grocery shopping.

I find arepas a refreshing meal in the sea of pubs and other unappealing restaurants on Queen West. They are healthy and filling. I typically order the veggie ones.  For some reason, I cannot fathom mixing beef and corn dough, but I do eat tamales (albeit chicken ones).

The service was so so. The male server was friendly and efficient. The female server was was full of excuses, ~sorry I don't speak Spanish~ ~how dare she?~"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of arepas so when I found his resto I was soooooo excited! 

Rating breakdown: 

4.5 stars - ambiance, decor, super cool spot - only criticism, table for 4 is a bit tight if you order lots of items... plus a bottle of water. 
5.0 stars - service was excellent! Attentive and prompt.
3.5 stars -food was salty! We ordered arepas w chorizo and flank steak, they just seemed overly salty.. arepa was dry and tasted a bit burned (I guess due to char markings), coleslaw was great and so were the tostadas! Lemonade costs 4.50 per glass, we found it too sweet.. 
Overall, a good experience for the most part, but we will search for another areperia to see how it compares."}
{"text":"A friend picked this eatery as a starting point for brunch on a weekend food tour of the Entertainment District. 
The inside is pretty spacious and it seems to be an exclusively popular spot with the locals in the area because every table was occupied about half hour after our group of five got there. Service is also friendly without being over-the-top.
The name of the eatery is representative of its main feature, the Arepa, hamburger pattie shaped dough made out of ground maize (corn) and browned on each side. They are prominent in the cuisine of Venezuela and Colombia.
I also got a cortado coffee while waiting for the rest of our group to arrive. I really have to get used to savoring it properly because I still prefer a regular coffee beverage :-)

At Arepa cafe, the dough patties are plated like a different take on a sandwich. The amount filling placed between an arepa makes the entire ensemble look slightly larger than a baseball.
For my meal, I wanted something that wasn't heavy and of all days I decided to go for one of the vegetarian choices, the Perico consisting of scarmbled eggs, tomatoes and onions. I also added an avocado to it because it looks so good in the picks. The green color of the avocado gave it a strickingly healthier touch to the rest of the filling. Each of our orders came it small side of coleslaw. 

The arepa sandwiches for me feel rather light, maybe it was because I got there very hungry. My sandwich wasn't heavy even though filling but it doesn't keep your stomach filled for more than a couple of hours. Maybe the ones that have meat in them would be more hearty.
I would say that it's good if you want a nice brunch if you're routine for the day keeps you on the go. I'll say it's a good place to come to for a late afternoon coffee break or a meal before a movie or a theatrical show."}
{"text":"Ever since I saw Bobby Flay do a Throwdown episode with a woman who makes these amazing arepas - I have been on a hunt to find an establishment that sold them.  Had to find out what all the buzz is about.

I have to admit I was a little disappointed. Ok. Maybe I was expecting the same kind of people working and making those arepas like I saw on TV. Lame, I know.  

It is overpriced for what you get.  This I can`t comprehend because the essentials of making an arepa are so easy, cheap and quick.  I can make them lick-ed-i-split. 

That aside, I`m going out to eat.  The portions are small and the `side`salad it came with - which was incredible - was literally one tablespoon size.  Seriously? Give the people more!

I had the gentleman behind the counter choose which arepa he felt was there best (chicken with guacamole/avocado).  I think if my arepa was not burnt I would have liked it more.  I was so disappointed by that. I could not shake that charred flavour out of my mouth.

With my cafe con leche, the bill was almost $14.  I have to admit I was floored.

I think this worthwhile to try. It`s different. Another plus, it`s gluten free."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to lunch places being a short walk from my workplace. Their arepas are seriously loaded plus they have lots of chicken/beef/pork as well as veggie options in their menu to suit your taste buds and cravings. They also give you three types of sauces to try along with as you are biting and strugging to keep all that stuffing from falling off, :) but be careful with that red sauce for it's really really hot! Also, you may want to give their fried cassava and \"bottled\" coke a try! Neat decor and friendly service,however, at times your food may take a while to arrive at your table!"}
{"text":"2.5 star. Just not really feeling this place.

Went with a friend after kettlebell class and we were starving.

Arepas range in price from about $8-$11. I got a cod arepa which sounded healthy, but when it arrived it was a mass of stir fried battered looking type stuff. I'm not sure how they heated up the arepa but considering it came out within 3 minutes of ordering, I'm assuming they must have microwaved it. My apera was BURNING HOT, there was steam coming out of it and I pretty much burned my hand trying to pick the damn thing up.

The sign said it came with a \"side\" of coleslaw, which was actually a tablespoon of coleslaw put into a tiny plastic cup meant to carry sauce. Hrmmm.

Can't say I'm overly impressed. My friend tried the roasted pork arepa and said the meat was very dry. 

Came to $12 with tax and tip for what seemed should have cost $5-$6. 

The decor inside was very nice and the server was friendly enough, but was not a fan of the food."}
{"text":"First time and last time here. I had many arepas in the past. 

This place lack of taste. The sauces are ok, but both the chicken and the chorizo were taste less. At a normal pricing, it is not a good deal. 

Also one of the arepa was already cold when served :(

I recommend trying a different place in Kensington market."}
{"text":"Good food and service. The place is very clean and had a great location.
The staff is Venezuelan, so they know what they are selling."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  Their arepa is definitely something different in Toronto.  Basically you put anything you want inside a corn bread. I liked the adobe arepa.  The meat is really soft. Get the guava juice. It's really good with the arepas.  Nice and clean place. Desserts are just amazing. We had the Plantain with honey and pistachio and I don't remember the name of the other dessert but it's really really good. See my pictures.  Next time I'll come just for the dessert."}
{"text":"I first noticed Arepa Cafe as I was walking down Queens St. Growing up in Latin America, I love all South and Latin American food and jumped at the chance to try this place. The menu gave me nostalgia and I wanted to order everything on the menu. Eventually I decided on the   Pabellon Caracas. This dish was authentic and full of flavor. The beef was well seasoned and complemented beautifully with the arepa. The black bean, sweet plantain and rice reminded me of comfort food from back home. I recommend this place to anyone who is interested in South American food and I know that I will definitely return again."}
{"text":"This was my first Arepa encounter and will likely remain my only for the near future. I was a little underwhelmed. Not to say the food or experience was bad, but it was just kind of blah. Are Arepa's generally pretty bland? I'm not sure because I don't really have a reference point, but they were here.

Following all the hype, I was a little disappointed. It was just ok. Nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly, location is ideal and the food is delicious. It was my first time eating an arepa, a Venezuelan sandwich that is the base dish of the restaurant. It was amazing. They accept credit cards, so another good thing there. I definitely recommend it. Highlights include the empanadas, the arepas and the sugar cane lemonade."}
{"text":"Perhaps I was a little too hard on this restaurant in my last review, as evidenced by the fact that I returned today after an intense craving for their adobo roasted pork arepa...it's a good one. The caramelized onions are perfectly done and the sweetness balances out the arepa and the pork, and the arepa is so fluffy and warm and just delicious. So no, it's still not \"authentic\" Venezuelan food and yes, the prices are still a bit high, but this place is still pretty darn good."}
{"text":"I've never been the biggest fan of arepas - the cornmeal flavor is and always will be a distraction - but I'll admit the Arepa Cafe does this Venezuelan specialty about as well as I could envision it being done.

We arrived in the afternoon on a weekend and quickly grabbed a couple of seats by the street. (It's not quite a patio but it was close enough to make me happy.)

We decided to start with the Green Plantain Tostones (\"Deep fried smashed green plantain served with herb mayo\"). I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this dish but it pretty much blew me away. The plantains were perfectly deep-fried - i.e. they were crispy on the outside and delectably creamy on the inside - and the accompanying herb mayo was a perfect complement. The plantains were maybe a little too salty but this is an awfully minor complaint.

For my main, I went with the Carne Mechada arepa (\"Shredded flank steak, tomato, garlic, sweet pepper, cumin\"). It arrived to the table piping hot, which is always a plus. And although the shredded flank steak was indeed quite tasty, it was so plentiful that it essentially turned the arepa soggy. I gave up trying to eat it like a sandwich and wound up eating more than half with my fork.

I also want to single out the three sauces that were provided with the meal. They were all amazing and ideally suited for the arepa. (And the spicy one is knock-you-off-your-chair hot but also impressively flavorful.)"}
{"text":"This Venezuelan cafe is delicious. Before arepa I had never tried arepa but have fallen in love with it. My go to is to is avocado with queso fresca. The garlic sauce is a must add. They also have fresh passion fruit juice, which is my absolute favourite. I've also tried their empanadas, but they're not the best."}
{"text":"Mmmm arepas! Their food was delicious :) We got La Safrina and the chorizo & egg arepa. Very tasty! The service is a little slow, but the people are friendly & the food is awesome--definitely recommend! Very nice interior too!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, cozy and chic ambience! Definitely recommend Arepa Cafe for lunch and dinner. Love the Adobo pork and Pabellon arepas!!"}
{"text":"Cozy little cafe,a small casual place to chill out with friends.

The menu is quite short but the food is delicious and the prices are decent. I had the pabellon caraqueño platter and my friend ordered the pabellon vegie arepa,both of which arrived quite quickly.

Our waiter was really friendly and always with a smile on his face. Would no doubt come back."}
{"text":"Although a unique experience having never tried venezuelan dishes, I didn't find the arepas too tasty. I felt like it was a bit pricey for what it was as well. I found both our arepas sort of bland. The sauces on the side were great but I wasn't too fond of just splattering a ton of pre-made sauce on my arepa to make to taste good.

Restaurant is set up fast food style, and has a nice open store front for outdoor sitting in the summer.

Worth trying but I probably wouldn't visit again for a while."}
{"text":"Awesome Venezuelan sandwiches! I had the Reina Pepiada which is sort of like chicken salad but way yummier and more flavourful, served on a perfect round bun (crispy on the outside, dough-y and soft on the inside). If you like avocados, this is the sandwich of your dreams. 
The sandwiches come with a variety of sauces from mild to spicy. 
The place itself is stylish and spacious and the staff are very relaxed and friendly (they actually seem to like their jobs, always refreshing). 
Prices are reasonable and the sandwiches are very filling! 
I really want this place to do well:)"}
{"text":"The food was well-made, the atmosphere was very calm and laid back. Service was fantastic. We ordered multiple arepas and beef empanada. The empanada, once dipped in the homemade hot sauce, was fantastic! First real time eating Venezuela, and it was better than I anticipated. Would recommend if you are on the fence of eating here. You never know until you try it!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating arepas - so I have little-to-no point of reference for my experience at Arepa Café. 

With that said: I can absolutely say that I enjoyed my meal here. 

I ordered the pabella arepa, and my $11.50 afforded me something that kept me full for most of the day. 

The bread here was key - I've always been partial to corn, which makes for savoury taste that is impossible to replicate through other grains.

All-in-all: good experience, and well worth the visit."}
{"text":"I got the Curvy Queen (chicken, avocado, red onion and coriander) for $8 and I also tried their dessert which was a dulce de leche cheesecake (I asked the cashier, and she said they make their own desserts).

I absolutely love this place! The Curvy Queen was delicious and what's great about this place is that they made a variety of sauces (not hot to mild to very hot) to accompany your arepa.

The cheesecake was also very delicious and wasn't overly sweet even though there was the dulce de leche on top of the cheesecake.

I had the pumpkin cheesecake here and loved it. It reminded me of the pumpkin cheesecake I had at Bier Markt which was also very delicious. There was a lot of pumpkin flavor and the cheese taste wasn't overpowering. Unfortunately, I think this is a seasonal dessert.

I highly recommend this place for a nice snack!"}
{"text":"Went there with 6 co-workers for lunch.

Food:  We ordered a bunch of different Arepas, when the portions first came out we all thought they were really small.  But the size was deceiving, the portions made all of us full.  The taste was very good and unique 


Locale: A bit worn down, but very homey.  They got music playing and a projector showing spots.  

Service: Friendly staff

I would recommend going there if you are looking to taste something different, or if you have a gluten allergy (most of their stuff is gluten free)"}
{"text":"Had the lunch special arepa with pork loin, avocado, arugula and onions and it was pretty tasty. The three sauces that are on the table to use are also good. The hot was a little hotter than I expected but thankfully I like spicy food. The orange gazpacho soup I tried, which was the soup of the day, had a nice flavour as well.

I had been meaning to try this place for a long time, and finally got around to it
The food was tasty, but is a little pricier than some of the places surrounding it. So I wouldn't come here often for lunch. But if you haven't tried it, its worth checking out just to taste something a little different."}
{"text":"For a café, this place has the same prices as any restaurant.  Alcoholic drinks are around $10-11/ea, arepas (basically a sandwich) are $10-ish, and desserts are at least $5.  \"Cheap\" by Toronto standards, I suppose.

Setting itself is pretty nice, a great escape from a somewhat grungy stretch of Queen W.

Now food was all great!  The Reina arepa basically tasted like guac with chunks of chicken.  The corn bread is very subtle tasting, with just a hint of corn.

Mojito with brown sugar cane - Just hit the spot for a warm afternoon, after a stressful morning.  It was also a great, albeit temporary, escape to a tropical island!

Tres leche cake - Came in a rather small ramekin, as opposed to a slice which I've had before at another Toronto eatery.  Size was rather small for $6.50 price point, but well presented.

Service was patient and friendly.  Would definitely visit again especially to capture that \"vacay\" feeling!"}
{"text":"Amazing food - great staff. We're regulars here and there's absolute reason for it. Great ambiance, food is quick and man, I can't live without that garlic mayo!"}
{"text":"my whole family is obsessed with this place.  we were lucky enough to happen upon arepa cafe while visiting toronto from texas.  all of us eat GLUTEN FREE so this place was a dream.  the arepas are so fluffy and substantial and all the goodies they put in the sammies.... omg they are just so fresh and tasty and heavenly.  
this place is fantastic, whether gluten free or not!"}
{"text":"Wow. 
I'd never tried an arepa before, but that was absolutely magical. I got the Carne Machada (shredded flank steak), it came with a delicious garlic sauce that I couldn't get enough of. Light, but surprisingly filling. 

Will definitely be returning. My wallet is afraid."}
{"text":"I love the carne mechada arepa (however watery/messy it may be), as well as the habanero and green pepper sauces that you have the option of slathering your arepa in.


Some warnings, though...

- Once I ordered an egg and chorizo arepa in the morning and it took over 20 minutes

- The orange habanero sauce is very spicy (as they'll tell you - trust them). I usually can't even tell if something is made to be spicy because my tolerance is pretty high, but a drop of this in a bite is enough for me to start feeling it. If you want something mild just go with the green pepper sauce (I thought it wasn't made to be spicy but other reviewers have made comments on it being spicy?).

- The arepa is super hot when it gets to you so if you have hands that are sensitive to heat (like mine), I suggest eating it with the fork instead or waiting a few minutes before biting in."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm a little surprised to see all the good reviews about this place.  I thought this place was OK but it's definitely not worth a 4.3 and up.  The food was tasty but I thought it was way overpriced for what you get.  All the aprepa cost over $10 and the sides cost additional money.  The service is very mediocre and I had to walk up to the cash register to get my cheque just bc they ignored me most of the time. I might go back but will be trying other restaurants in the neighbourhood first."}
{"text":"Arepa has delicious warm, comfort food. We always order the carne mechada (shredded flank steak) it's  so so good! If you like hot sauce they make some great ones that go along with all the dishes. 
The owners are great people that make you feel welcome"}
{"text":"A-ree-pa? A-rape-a? I don't know. 

VIBE 
Located in the old Tequila Bookworm space, this is a haven for those who love Brick walls and a drafty breeze.  You can wi-fi to your heart's content and have a beer as well. All kidding aside, we had great service and the space is light and airy. I like the space. And um, who knew there was Venezuelan food in TO? 

WE ATE 
They have some pretty awesome combos here - arepa of the day + beer for $12 so I got the carne mechada -shredded flank steak, tomato, garlic, pepper, cumin - wrapped in two pieces of dense corn bread paired with MIll Street Organic. My dining companion had the vegetarian arepa. Not my cup of tea to be honest.

The steak lacked flavour and it was a good 3 portions of meat. So yes, hearty, but no to lack of toppings. And the hot sauce is HOT. Like mouth-on-fire, get me a glass of milk stat hot. Caution on the hot sauce. As much as I wanted to love the food I was not impressed. 

My friend seemed to like her vegetarian one but the consensus was this was a lot of food, even though it doesn't look like it. 

I topped it off with an alfajore. It was nice but I think I was in the mood for something more chocolatey. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK
Great space; meh food.  If you want a catch up with a friend, I'd come here for beers or coffee but I'd try something other than the arepa."}
{"text":"I was introduced to  this spot by a Venezuelan boss and he stands by their authenticity.  Says it's just like the street food back home. I've been  here a couple times and this laid back cafe dishes out some fine eats. My favourite is the curvy queen (which is supposedly the original arepa!). I prefer the Argentine style empanadas but these cornmeal ones are pretty delish too. Great friendly service.  Definitely stop by if you ever get the chance! Give their malt beverage a try if you're up for it. I like the taste of the polar but not every does!"}
{"text":"Was craving a good ole tres leche cake, yelped it up, saw Arepa had one on their menu...

And the verdict...

Extremely disappointed in their attempt of a tres leche cake. It was served in a Tiramisu container, extremely runny at the bottom, almost like your eating a pudding...with torched up whip cream on top---- tres Leche (three layers) there were no layers in this pudding thing--- this is not how an original tres leche Cake is suppose to taste, look, and feel. It's a cake not custard!

Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pros:

The food is very good, ingredients are of high quality, and the portions are large but not obscene.
The items served are unusual but not inaccessible.
The room looks very cool, and the ambience is casual.
Prices are reasonable.

Cons:
The service can be a tad distracted.
Hard to spot from the street.
Arepa Café uses a brand of arepa corn meal that is commercially available in markets but which cannot fully guarantee that it is free from gluten, according to the label. So if you have celiac disease, you may not wish to take the risk, even though items are advertised as gluten free. Chances are you'll be fine, but if luck is not on your side... frowny face."}
{"text":"Wow! What a hunk of a sandwich! 

Came here for the first time after years of telling myself to try it out. I had la mechada arepa with shredded flank steak, garlic, tomato, cumin, and pepper. Ordered at the counter and had it to stay, but they will take your order at the table too if you decide to sit down and enjoy it. Not too long after ordering, the server brought me my sandwich which was hot, dripping, and oh-so delicious with a little side of creamy coleslaw. She also brought me a trio of sauces to have with the arepa as well; a creamy white mayo-based sauce, a green salsa, and a red hot spicy sauce. I tried the white, green, then the red one last. The white was probably my favourite as it complimented my rich meaty arepa in a great way, and the green was not half bad. Considering that the green salsa was not spicy at all, I thought the red one wouldn't be too spicy but I was in for a huge surprise! It started out slow in the middle of my tongue and spread outward like a blistering spitfire. I could feel it sizzling all the way in my ears! Thank God for that creamy coleslaw to soothe the burn but I had to down quite a bit of water to cool my mouth down enough to continue eating. Phew. The sandwich was a good size for a small person like me, wonderfully meaty, and I loved the corn-based bun. Super yummy, I'll definitely be back but I'll be staying away from that red pepper sauce... 

Service was friendly, and the food is just great! The only thing I didn't enjoy was the paper-lined plastic basket it was served in. The piece of waxed paper needs to be bigger or the container needs to have a solid bottom because that guy got messy! I used up a solid stack of napkins wiping off the juices dripping all over my hands (a sign of a damn good sandwich). Can't wait to come back and try something else!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were visiting from out of the country and this was one of the worst customer service experience I have received. Never in my life have I been treated so poorly and disrespectfully, the server there was rude to all of us and began using illicit language. One of us were in line to get some coffee and the rest of us took a seat, the waiter came over and told us we couldn't stay there and prompted to kick us out into the cold weather. We even informed her we would buy some items off the menu and she became very rude towards us. Never will I go here again or recommend this place - the customer service was horrible and ill-mannered."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and pleasant staff. It's exposed brick and a bit artsy.  We came in for coffee and dessert on a Sunday night and based on recommendations had the très léchés which was excellent. If you are familiar with Indian dessert, it's similar to raas malai. I want to come back and try brunch here."}
{"text":"Arepas lacked seasoning and flavour. (I tried a beef and a pork one) I don't think this place deserves 4 stars but the space was lot bigger and nicer than I had imagined for a shop on crowded Queen Street West.

I also tried the yucca fries which didn't taste anything special.

The garlic mayo was great! Unfortunately, I had to depend on this dressing for flavour on the arepas.

At $10-$14 per arepa, I thought it was pretty pricy for the size."}
{"text":"Not entirely impressed with Arepa Cafe. I had la reina pepiada (chicken + avocado) and it was quite bland. Yes, I know, arepa is generally bland but the filling should not be.
If you want serious Venezuelan comida (food) try Gordo on Bathurst (I don't work for Gordo I'm just trying to help y'all out)"}
{"text":"Iys oretty dam good food. Try the froed plantine. So sweet and nice. The sauces are made inhouse and arw all soo good. The sandwhiches are dence. Tasty and very satisfying. Also had the sugarcane lemonade and it was amazing. Really good food. Nice athmosohere. Its a must go place."}
{"text":"The space itself is very inviting.  I appreciated the generous space between each table.  For the first time in a while, I didn't feel like I was sitting in my neighbouring table's lap!  We ordered a beer - $5 for a bottle of Mill St. Organic, totally reasonable while we checked out the menu.

We started with the tequeños which were a bit greasy, but so good!  I tried the scotch bonnet sauce with it and it kicked my butt!  Our server had warned us that the sauce was spicy and he wasn't kidding!  So yummy but beware!  A little goes a long way!

I had the beef tenderloin, fresh cheese (which the server suggested I have slightly grilled which I think was an excellent call), and avocado arepa.  The corn- flour bun was a little bland tasting, but I really loved it texture.  Everything was tasty, but I couldn't eat more than half of it; it was simply too much for one go!

At the end of the meal, our server came over to talk to me to make sure I liked everything.  I appreciated his interest.

I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"This place is just fine. Not excellent but not bad either. Service was good and friendly. We ordered the Chicken Empanadas, La Pelua, and Pabellon Arepas. The space is incredible, by the way!

The Chicken Empanadas were good but not like classic empanadas. Instead of a flour pastry it was made with a corn pastry (kinda like the arepas). The filling too was not authentic - or at least what I consider to be authentic as I usually eat Venezuelan empanadas. The arepas were also just good. The flank steak filling is something I make at home, just a little dry here. The arepas were very messy to eat. The salsas -sauces - were fantastic. The red one is VERY VERY VERY spicy. The green pepper one was refreshing and the garlic mayo was delightful. We also had the alfajors, which again were different from the usual variety I enjoy. The dulce de leche was a lot sweeter than I expected.

It was nice to try something new, I'm a little sad it didn't wow me. I would come back here to try out some other varieties of arepas but only if I had a craving.

Side note: On the east wall you can notice what I think is a bricked up old timey loading dock door or doorway. Pretty cool."}
{"text":"I have found Venezuelan food heaven in downtown Toronto! The best Venezuelan food I've ever had outside Venezuela. I tried the cachapas, tequeños and arepa de carne mechada. Divino! Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Solid 4-star. 
I was looking around for place to eat on Yelp and the description for the food at this place intrigued me. To be honest, I had no idea what I was expecting. I had thought this place was near Ossington too, only to drive past it and realize it's even east of Bathurst. I walk by this strip almost every week and I have consistently missed its existent. 

The first thing that impressed me was the decor. Small cafe with waiter services and soft lighting. The window seat is perfect for people watching. Our server was extremely attentive and checked on us every time we got something new.

The food was great, although the cold-hot mixture took me off-guard. The cornmeal is piping hot while the chicken avocado was super cold. The flavour was very lime-centric and a lot of onions but overall the taste was great.

For dessert, the tres leche was fantastic, a sponge-cake with condensed, evaporated, and normal milk. Very coconuty. 

The price is pretty reasonable too. A little less than $10 for the sandwich and a little more than $10 for the platters. 

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Having only ever eaten the wonderful arepas a Pica Pica in San Francisco (featured on DDD on the Food Network), I had pretty high expectations of Arepa Café in Toronto.  Plenty of great reviews on Yelp, so we headed there after a book launch.  

The vibe / ambience of the place is brilliant, old red brick walls, funky \"paper plane\" installations, and modern seating.  We started with the plantains and the yucca and all ordered the Arepa Sampling plate - three 4oz arepas - one with chicken and avocado, one beef, and one bean and cheese (these are obviously not the actual technical terms for the arepas, but you get my drift). We were told there would be a 20 minute wait, so we order a couple of pitchers of sangria to pass the time (maybe this was their excellent sales plan all along?)

The yucca came out steamy, hot and delicious, but sadly the plantains were limp and stone cold :(  However, they quickly whipped them away and brought us a fresh, hot plate which was delicious.  The best part was the sauces - three of them! One was a green, mild, cilantro sauce, one a red hot spicy sauce, and the other a garlic mayo.  I passed on the mayo, but the other two were unbelievable.  I honestly just wanted to covet the whole bottle of the green one to myself then secretly squirt the herby deliciousness straight down my throat...you'll be glad to know I refrained :)  

Moving on to the star...THE AREPAS! I started with the black bean, for me it was seriously under salted, but that was quickly remedied.  The corn arepa was good, but just seemed a little heavy and dry.  I felt like it needed a gravy of some sort - so I piled on the sauces.  So, I went for the chicken and avocado next - same - under seasoned.  This was definitely my favourite. Finally, I had the beef.  Not impressed - it was dry and chewy and I really couldn't face more corn meal.  

I'm glad I had the sample, and I would recommend Arepa Café, but I would probably try something else next time.  The price of the food was very affordable, but $30 for a small pitcher of sangria (which in its defense had a boat load of fresh fruit in it) was a bit pricey.  Maybe I'm just a tight-arse when it comes to paying for drinks :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years for lunch, dinner, meetings and even ordering over the phone and having them give the food to an uber drive to drive it to my home since they don't have uber eats and I live in Etobicoke! Tequeños and la llanera are a must. If you have a sweet tooth you have to get the sugar cane lemonade and Tres Leches."}
{"text":"The food here is FANTASTIC. and the staff are INCREDIBLE. We went here during our queen street walk and being sensitive to gluen - i wanted to give it a try. Omgod. The arepa's are amazing. we had the guacamole.chicken one and the most popular one...with meat and beans and cheese. omgod. Im salviating remembering them. The warm bun, the well stuffed filling ooozing out. The staff were incredibly helpful friendly and even let me have a free gluten free ducle de leche cheesecake for my bday! My fiance ordered a Alfahores for dessert. Although it wasnt as good as my moms makes them they were still very awesome. 

We cant wait to come back and try more of their Arepa's!"}
{"text":"If I closed my eyes while sitting here on a sunny Saturday afternoon, I almost felt like I was in Venezuela (disclaimer: I have never been to Venezuela). Bright and welcoming, a friend and I specifically planned our day around trying this place, and I'm glad we did. 

Upon entering the cafe, we were a little confused with the ordering process...there's a counter with a menu board behind it (for take-out, I assume), but they also do table service so you can sit down and look at a menu before placing your order. I ordered the tequenos (I learned that it's pronounced: teckenYOS), a veggie arepa, and a 1/2 pint of Mill St. Organic. The tequenos were SO GOOD, and came with a generous dollop of guacamole. Ultimately, my eyes were bigger than my stomach, as after I gobbled down all 4 delicious tequenos I could hardly finish half of my arepa. The arepa \"pocket\" was a little bit unexpected for me in both taste and texture...kind of sweet and kind of crumbly, yet kind of savory and chewy at the same time. My friend ordered lemonade, chicken empanada and some sort of beef arepa whose name eludes me at the moment - the empanada received raved reviews, but the arepa, not so much. 

To be honest I'm a bit on the fence about arepas. Maybe they're an acquired taste. But would I be willing to go back and try another? Definitely. With a 1/2 pint of Mill St. Organic, please."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying an arepa and I was happy to see that the menu had a large variety of different arepas. Chicken, steak, pork, vegetarian options with tons of different toppings and sauces. I went with the steak and cheddar arepa after some tough deliberations. 

My arepa was huge and stuffed with a great amount of steak. At first it was very hard to eat but you end up figuring out a way. The steak was juicy and tender with great seasonings and the arepa shell itself was soft with a little crisp. It was a great combination of flavours. 

For dessert I tried the tres leche cake with a latte. Both delicious! 

This is a really great lunch or dinner spot on Queen west, definitely worth checking out for some Venezuelan eats."}
{"text":"Over the summer, my friend and I were in Toronto and had the challenge of finding a restaurant that was nut allergy friendly (for me), and vegan and Celiac friendly (for her). Given the number of restaurants in this city, you'd think that would be easy. But it wasn't. Luckily we stumbled upon Arepa Cafe during our search and were overjoyed to find out it had food to suit both of our dietary needs.

We both had the arepa with black beans, plantain, and avocado, plus I had mozzarella on mine. I originally wasn't too keen on eating here, but my expectations were far, far exceeded. It was delicious, but very messy.  Next time I'm bringing a bib and some wet naps!"}
{"text":"I tried arepa once in my life at a Colombian friends house and ever since I've been craving for them, but failed in finding or making them. Finally I heard of Arepa Café so when I had the chance I immediately visited this place.
Arepa Café is located at the prime restaurant location. 
The decor was very trendy and hipster, as most new restaurants seem to be these days, and most tables were occupied.
We were immediately attended to and were asked if we needed any help or questions regarding the menu. 
My eyes went straight for the Pulpo, which was an octupus filled arepa. My brother on the other hand, having a larger appetite, chose the brunch platter, which consisted of beans, cheese, scrambled eggs, avocado, and arepa. 
The food took around 15ish minutes to make, which shows that they make everything fresh. 
The food, once it arrived, looked great, but the serving size was pretty tiny, including the platter. 
My octopus arepa was very messy to eat as the arepa was overstuffed, but the stuffing was delicious and fresh. I finished feeling like I've eaten something healthy, which I pretty sure it was as the octopus was boiled but seasoned very well with a citrus marinade. However, I also felt like I only ate an appetizer as I was still quite hungry. 
My brother seemed satisfied and enjoyed his meal too. 
So, all in all, I will definitely return and may order the same thing as it was really good, but next time I'll also include a side along with the arepa."}
{"text":"Arepa Cafe is a nice place to drop by having a light snack..... 

If everyone is still hungry eating that Arepa just like me? I definitely felt the same after eating my Arepa and that half a mouthful of coleslaw..

Arepa+Juice ($10.50)
- I always have problem decide what to eat because I just like eating anything? so I told the waiter the Special and did not even ask what that special is.. (as far as I know, none of the Arepa has raisins inside so I am A-OK)
- End up the Special of the Day is Shredded Pork and Tomato.. not bad tasting at all... and the pork is nice and soft and I love tomato too..
- That sauce!! oh I love that mind blowing, mouth numbing hot sauce!! Now that's what I call spicy!! (hot hot hot!!)
- The guava juice is quite nice...but I think I will need the beer combo to put out the hot spicy sensation! :)

The arepa itself is really good.. but a little pricey... I have still hungry, but lucky I am at Queen St West an area with a lot of other food choices to fill me up! NEXT!"}
{"text":"I'd give this 3.5.  

I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who commented about the hot sauce!  I think its colour (thousand-island orange) is misleadingly creamy because I didn't do a mini-taste test first before pouring a bit on my arepa and my mouth turned into the centre of the SUN for a good five minutes.  Serves me right!  

This place is really cute, good atmosphere, especially in summer months.

Anyway, to the food: The arepa flatbread is really tasty, like a cornbread English muffin.  I got the veggie arepa, which had so many black beans I couldn't finish them all, but the plantain and avocado were really tasty.

Boyfrond got the cod, which he wasn't too impressed with--I guess the fish was pretty dry.  Everything was served, as others have mentioned, with three different sauces, service was decent as it can be when it's hopping busy.  

I'd definitely give this place another shot--it's a perfect go-to for a casual bite on queen west."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Meh, just okay. Nothing stood out to be remembered and nothing was bad tasting. The portions are small. Alright spot."}
{"text":"It's fair to say that every country has made at least one lasting contribution to the global pocket food scene. India has the samosa; Turkey the schwarma; Canada can be proud of the Pizza Pocket, and Venezuela has the Arepa (uh-ray-pa): a soft round corn-flour oval stuffed (and I mean stuffed) with tempting and delicious innards. There are many ways to fill an arepa, and this Queen West eatery (just west of Spadina) has figured most of them out.

It's a lovely space. Long, slender and pretty colour-crazy inside. We decided to start out with an order of the tequeños, which are like gourmet mozzasticks. Instead of a deep fried breaded coating they have a tender flaky coating and the cheese inside is oh-so-gooey. I'll get them again.

For dinner, Crystal and I shared an arepa. It must be said that this dish is virtually unshareable. Even though we tried valiantly, the process was messy. But that didn't make it any less delicious. We tried a vegetarian option with beans, cheese and avocado. It was pretty amazing. The toppings are fresh and the corn pita is soft and delicious. At $7.50+ some would consider arepas a pricy snack, but for me they are actually quite filling. Sharing an app, you could easily call it dinner. 

There are too many options on the venue to end this story here, plus I hear they have killer desserts. I will definitely return.

Obligatory Title Pun: Tramping out the vintage where The AREPEs of wrath are stored.

Menu Readability: I remember it being like the restaurant: bright and narrow.

Need to mention: You can order beer here.

What this place teaches me about myself: Like people, arepas hate being bisected in two."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great sandwiches! I was in an odd mood and craving a fish sandwich at 11:15am. Thankfully Arepa Cafe came through and delivered for me (not actual delivery but they are on foodora) Anyway, the saltine cod sandwich was very satisfying and the sauces they provide on the side are great. My americano was excellent and the service was very fast. 

Did I mention the sandwiches are GLUTEN FREE!! Holy moly what a treat! I love not being bloated after lunch. They also have delicious 7% alc KW Craft cider on tap to cater to the gluten-free crowd. I'll be back here soon."}
{"text":"Im a vegetarian and was excited to find this place. Our group of three were never waited on and left. We saw waitstaff literally bypass us the entire time we waited. We initially thought they were just busy and trying to catch up.  

After about 20 minutes of no service or even a \"be with you shortly\" my group had enough and wanted to move on."}
{"text":"The arepas are delicious! They also serve americanos The staff is friendly and welcoming and the owner is really nice."}
{"text":"I'm officially in love with this place! I came here for lunch one day because Shanghai Cowgirl had a 45 minute wait, and I'm so glad I did. I'm quite fond of these grilled cornmeal sandwiches for its dense, crumbly texture. 

My boyfriend ordered arepa of the day- ham and cheese, which came stuffed with an incredible amount of shredded cheddar. I would prefer all of the cheese to be melted, but the combination was delicious nevertheless. 

I went for la llanera with beef tenderloin, avocado, fresco cheese and tomato. The meat was nicely charred and tender, and I loved the combination of the creamy avocado and fresco cheese. I wished that the filling was distributed more evenly within the sandwich. By the time I got to the bottom, all the avocado and beef were gone, and I was left with only cheese and sauce (which was still delicious). 

The arepas come with three types of sauce: garlic mayo, green pepper sauce and hot sauce. The hot sauce, however, was spectacularly spicy! I'm normally quite tolerant with spicy food, after a few generous squeeze, I was in tears! Now that is what I call spicy! That said, it was really tasty, but next time I'll be more light handed with the hot sauce. My boyfriend particularly favoured the garlic mayo and he slathered it all over the sandwich between his bites. 

Of course, we had to finish the meal with my favourite Dulce de Leche cheesecake. I'm officially proclaiming this cheesecake as my favourite in the city! It's just so good! Even my boyfriend, normally a cheesecake hater, really enjoyed the cake. It was delectable!

In addition, I also sampled the pumpkin cheesecake and alfajor cookie. I was actually disappointed with the alfajor cookie, as it had too much icing sugar on it. It was not nearly as delicious as the one I had from Aroma Espresso Bar. The pumpkin cheesecake was also delicious, but for $5, the portion seemed a little small. 

All in all, I really love this place- the vibe, the people, the food. If I lived near Arepa Café, I'd be coming here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Friendly staff. Very good arepas (that thing isn't easy to eat!) The sugarcane lemonade is awesome, and they have pretty good desserts. The small patio aka terrace or whatever you call it is a good place for people watching at night. All kinds of people, very entertaining. Beware of the red sauce. I like spicy (I put Sriracha on my eggs in the morning), but that s**t is dope. Very good, nice nasal taste, but very spicy!"}
{"text":"Before writing this review I popped my head up and asked my friend \"what are those sandwiches called at Arepa?\" Her reply? \"Ugh. Idiot. Arepas.\" Blush, nod and giggle. Blush, nod and giggle. 

So I enjoy the arepas at Arepa very much. If you haven't tried on before, they are dug out monsters that require utensils. Any one that comes with avocado comes with a lot of avocado. Too much avocado. Chicken salad? Avocado salad is more like it. 

They also have free Wifi. And you know what goes great with free wifi? Deep fried cheese. They have that, too. And deep fried cheese goes great with their three hot sauce options. When you give a mouse a cookie... they're going to require three hot sauce choices. 

PEPPER'S PISSED: Avocado is overrated. Period."}
{"text":"Been coming here for awhile now. La IIanera is to die for. I ask for raw red onion with it. As mentioned before, the servers are all very warm and welcoming and the food is fantastic especially for gluten allergies. No compromising taste to accommodate dietary restrictions here. These sandwiches pack a punch and are very filling. I'm so glad this place isn't too far from home!"}
{"text":"Staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Love the people who work here.

These arepas were delicious and they felt healthy: The ingredients were very fresh.  Even the shaved cheddar was real cheddar, not the fake cheddar I'd expect.  They were cheap, there was a lot of it, it was delicious, and it actually felt like I was eating healthful food.  It's the perfect place for lunch.

My only \"complaint\" is that it was too much food.  I don't know anyone who can finish that amount of food for lunch.

Oh, also, they don't take credit cards.  That's a second complaint (actually, the only real complaint I have.)"}
{"text":"I only tried arepas for the first time in October and they quickly became one of my favourite foods! The first time I tried them was on a food tour, so mine was ordered for me and I just kind of went with the flow. It was a chicken and avocodo arepa. It kind of looked like that gross chicken salad you can get at what a bagel, but instead of mayo, they used avo. YUM! 

When I decided I needed to fullfill my arepa craving following that one experience, I discovered this little gem very close to my apartment. My bf and I went there with a couple we're friends with, and the guy is actually Venezuelan so it worked out nicely. He gave us the scoop on what was good, authentic, etc etc. Well surprise surprise I got the same type as last time and it was just as amazing. I love how they use corn bread for their bread, but it's not like that corn bread that you get as a side with ribs, it's like yummy, pita-ish, polenta tasting, fluffy, deliciousness.

Ugh, all this arepa talk has made me hungry! Who's down to go for one??"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe I haven't been here! it's the most unnoticeable restaurant ever if it wasn't for Yelp. I have been walking by this so often and didn't even realize there's something here.

The restaurant is bigger than it looks (from the outside), there is actually waiter service. It's not just a sandwich shop!! The staff here is very nice. It takes about 15-20 minutes for them to make your food though. They try to prepare everything fresh.

The cafe is modern looking, red brick walls, adorable furniture. In Jan when I visited, it was featuring an exhibit called MIGRATION (paper airplane structures hung from the ceiling). You can definitely read more on their blog!

Although it's \"bigger than it looks from the outside,\" the maximum number of people per a table is about 5. Mostly 2-person tables. Very crammed.

la llanera $10.75 (customer favourite) is beef tenderloin (thick), avocado (two large chunks), fresco cheese, tomato. Your first impression would be, \"How do I eat this thing?\"

la pelua $9.50 is carne mechada (this is Venezuelan shredded beef), and cheddar cheese. This one was mmm-mmm delicious. Very flavourful, and I much prefer this over the \"customer favourite\" above."}
{"text":"My Venezuelan boyfriend was in heaven! We ate here 3 times in one weekend. The servers were so nice and the food was great. You must get the tostones and the passion fruit juice! We ended up both leaving with tshirts and we will definitely be back next time we are in Toronto!"}
