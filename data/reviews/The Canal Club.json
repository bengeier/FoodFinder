{"text":"Kinda hidden away inside The Scott resort, bit definitely worth a little searching for. Stopped nearby at the Mercedes dealer for a quick service and decided to kill the time with a good breakfast. 

And got one. A really good one. 

Had the Peruvian Hash w/ braised pork and a side of fruit. The hash was straight heavenly, not overly heavy, bursting with the smoky flavor of the pork which was cut beautifully with a nicely acidic jalape√±o hollandaise. The potatoes are diced and nicely crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. And the fruit was fresh. 

Looks like this would also be a fantastic spot for some relaxed drinks before dinner. Definitely filing away as a date stop as well."}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM ALERT  Seriously... what used to be an extension of the  Firesky Resort has now transformed into an intoxicating Havana Night atmosphere known as, The Scott. Where else can you be late to a standard  happy hour and still get an hours worth of discounted craft cocktails  ( I had the salt river) and apps?! Yes, happy hour is 4-7 + live music. But don't sell yourself short with the HH menu (I recommend the plantains and or ceviche) ... you'll want to stay for entrees. Specifically the 24 Hour Short Rib and Goucho Steak!

The atmosphere, service, and food exceeded our expectations. You need to experience this transformation for yourself!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with a fresh and lively atmosphere. Staff were pleasant and friendly. Food was a Cuban fuse wit the Cuban sandwich being the only item that resembled Cuban.. Dessert was ok.. not the best 3 milks I've had."}
{"text":"My review began as a 2, but as dinner progressed the rating improved.  Like many others recently,  the wait is ridiculous. After waiting 10 minutes and the bar tender yelling that the hostess would be back soon I had to walk in the kitchen and ask of they were open.   WE WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE THERE!  

The drinks came out petty fast and tasted good. They should for $13 a pop.  The crispy pizza appetizer and ceviche were both very tasty. 

Had the Cobb and Fresca Ensalada as mains.  Both were very good. The Cobb was probably the best rendition of this salad that I've had. The tres leche jar is absolutely delicious.

Our server was pleasant and attentive.  I'm glad (and relieved) our experience on arriving wasn't the way dinner turned out."}
{"text":"The Canal Club is a trendy restaurant in the Scott hotel. The decor gives off an island vibe, while still remaining sophisticated. 

The service was very awkward. When we arrived we approached an empty hostess stand and waited five minutes or so until the hostess returned. No other employees offered to help us during this time. We had reservations and the hostess told us to \"wait one moment\" and then walked away. She didn't come back for a few minutes so we ordered drinks at the bar. We had to tell the bartenders our drink orders multiple times because they either didn't hear or us or didn't care to hear us (which I assume is the latter because they hardly looked our way). They did not seem to be very busy at this time. I ordered the Helen & Maude cocktail which is a coconut mojito and it was divine. I would go back just for this cocktail alone! 

The hostess came back to tell us she was getting our table ready and then left again. When we saw her again a few minutes later she was picking up drinks from the bar, looked at us and said \"I guess you can just follow me.\" Um, what? 

Our server was incredibly sweet, but seemed to be a bit unprepared. He did not know much about the menu and did not know anything about the Restaurant Week menus placed at our table. We also had to ask repeatedly for extra silverware and menus- though this was probably the hostess's error and not his. We had a party of five and they had set the table for only three guests. 

We ordered the tuna tostada, shrimp ceviche, and the chimmichurri steak. Everything was just average, and a bit salty. The one dish we did really love was the strawberry pie. It was nice and light with a flaky, buttery crust. 

Although we were a bit disappointed with our experience, I wouldn't rule out trying the Canal Club again in the future. Especially for another Helen & Maude cocktail!"}
{"text":"Loved!! The atmosphere was fun- very Palm Springs, Havana, Cuban & trendy. The restaurant is half indoor, half outdoor with bistro lights outside to set the mood. Food was great, I tried the Scott burger. It is a little on the pricey side, especially for what you are getting, but the friendly staff and ambiance make it a good eat!"}
{"text":"Food, restaurant ambiance, and service... If two out of three are decent it usually makes for a good night.  I thought I was safe taking my wife here for her birthday after seeing all the good reviews and the cool pictures of the restaurant... unfortunately, that was not the case.  Don't get me wrong, the restaurant looks as cool as the pictures and it definitely sets the right vibe for a special occasion but everything else failed.  

When we first arrived we walked up near the bar to where it appears there is a host stand but not host was there.  The restaurant was pretty empty as it was a Wednesday night.  After a minute or two of standing awkwardly one of the two bartenders asked if they could help us with anything or something to that effect... then they said we can seat ourselves wherever.  Fair enough, we sat down were greeted fairly quickly to see if we wanted something to drink.  To be fair the drinks we're decent, my wife got a drink that tasted like an orange cream hard candy... it was quite good.  My drink was called a letter to a friend or something like that, it was okay but I didn't think either drink was really worth the $10-13 per drink we spent on them.  

I got the vegetarian pizza which was one of the cheapest items on the menu ($10 I believe) and french fries. It wasn't really pizza however, more like a tostada with white bean spread on it and arugala I believe.  It was okay but the bean spread flavor pretty much over powers everything else so it's nothing I'd ever order again.  My wife got the salmon which I believe was in the $25-$30 range... she said it was very bland and ended up eating a majority of my fries.  

The food was not the worst part about our experience, it was definitely the service.  Our waiter kept saying he would make sure we get water but it took forever for the other lady to finally bring some.  Not a big deal, just a little annoying... The more annoying part happened when we wanted to get our bill so we could leave and go to another restaurant that serves cheaper drinks but our server was nowhere to be found.  Finally about a 1/2 hour of waiting later he shows up with an upside down cake in hand (for my wife's birthday).  It was definitely a nice gesture and while it was mainly whipped cream it still tasted good.  However we now felt bad about asking for a check right away so stupidly we didn't bring up that we wanted the check and yep... had to wait for about another half hour before we finally saw him again.

I think I'm done trying to find good higher end restaurants to eat at.  I'm willing to pay $20-$30 for my plate of food but it at least has to be decent and good service should be the easiest thing for restaurants to figure out."}
{"text":"I agree with the hidden gem alert title people are putting up. The scott is one of the most picturesque hotels I've seen I love the Cuban style look. The place is jaw dropping and the bar is perfect with the theme. It has many good tropical options and coffee drinks very Havana. The visit we had couldn't have gone better we went on a late Saturday night am hour before closing. The service was perfect. The bartender made us feel so welcomed and the conversation between us and everyone else at the bar was so cool and it was a good  time with great drinks.  The staff was polite and I loved how even after it was closing time they kept the place open because people from a wedding had just arrived. Instead of kickcing people out they kept serving and the good time continued. Everything on the menu we tried was good the bartender even made us a couple off the menu drinks with coffee to keep us going lol. I love the atmosphere here and I could go here everyday have a good drink and sit anywhere inside or out in this stunning place. Nicely done scott and canal."}
{"text":"We went here for our office Christmas lunch and were very impressed. First of all, if you ever visited the previous restaurant in this space, Taggia, this is nothing like it. They have completely remodeled the lobby and restaurant of the hotel and given it a tropical, Cuban, Ernest Hemingway vibe. It makes me want to come back in the summer and sit at the bar while wearing my classic Banana Republic safari shirt and guzzle some rum drinks!

However, being a work lunch we weren't drinking, but we did try the food and everyone was very impressed. I had the Cubano sandwich while my co-workers had the Pulled Chicken Torta, Scott Burger, Cobb Salad, and an order of Plantains. For dessert, we shared an order of the Tres Leches Jar,  Churro Donut Holes, and the Cajeta Cheesecake. Everyone was very happy with the food and my boss even liked it so much that she went back the following week and had Green Chile Chicken Oaxaca Pizza which she also said was excellent.

Service was on point and we were all very happy. This is definitely a place to which I will return!"}
{"text":"Great place on the patio of the Scott Resort. We had a family of 6 for an early dinner and it had both an upscale and relaxed atmosphere that was perfect for our family. They had a nice selection of Cuban influenced items. Our server was very accommodating and helpful. The food was delicious."}
{"text":"''This is a cool, vibey place in the refurbished \"The Scott Hotel\" I felt like a modern day Lucy Ricardo in this fun Cuban atmosphere. The patio seating was lovely, service was warm and attentive and the food was delicious--I took so many photos (design inspiration) that I was waiting for that subtle tap on the shoulder...\"ma'am, please vacate the premises\" but thankfully they were quite accommodating--I assume they are used to this!"}
{"text":"New to cuban food but if this is what it is about
I want more!  The place is small indoor outdoor seating options. Perfect choice for a brunch!!"}
{"text":"The resort ambience is great. The food and prices are mediocre. The service is terrible. Slow, with an unconcern for customers more reminiscent of the DMV. Drinks took about 25 minutes to arrive in a mostly empty restaurant while the manager kept walking past. The problem seems to emanate from the management all the way down."}
{"text":"A set 4 course meal due to it being Valentines Day. The food was fabulous. The service was great also. I will say that the atmosphere is mediocre at best. Not really a Cuban feel. If they could redo their decor I think this restaurant could be a great place to dine on more than just special occasions. I would like to try it again when they have the full menu to order from."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful evening sitting outside on the patio at the Canal Club. I can't remember our servers name, but he was beyond amazing! We tried several of their magical cocktails, shared the asparagus appetizer, the Cuban sandwich and the churro donuts. All very flavourful and fun!"}
{"text":"This place was beautiful! The decor was like being in Havana, or Miami. Outdoor seating by the pool with umbrella to block the AZ sun was perfect. Decent food selection, avocado toast was good but not too much flavor. The hash was delicious and was a large portion."}
{"text":"This place was gorgeous! Great drinks and delicious food! I had the chicken torta and shared the banana waffles with my girlfriends! Caitlin was our server and she was the sweetest! The 1930's Havana theme is awesome. It's like stepping back in time. The decor of The Scott Resort is so lush and tropical! I will certainly be back for a staycation this summer!"}
{"text":"This place's decor is very aesthetically pleasing and it's a great place to get drinks. The food is mediocre, and extremely overpriced. $20 for a steak salad. The cocktails are delicious but otherwise, this place is not the best pick for food. It's also pretty hot inside even with air conditioning. I would recommend coming and sitting at the bar for only a drink. Also, the waitress took forever to refill our waters and check on us and the restaurant was half empty."}
{"text":"Really nice setting and great vibes, we loved the atmosphere! We were there on a Saturday night and the restaurant was super quiet (only 2 other tables seated). Despite other reviews saying service was slow, we were served very quickly, our waitress was attentive and super nice.

Menu:

- Really good cocktails
- Ridiculously small ceviche for $15
- Very limited choices (only 3 desserts)
- Not really Cuban

Please get a more inspired chef and add a few choices to your menu, don't change anything else!"}
{"text":"Who else tried to make Mother's Day reservations 5 days in advance and had to call about 15 place before finding a spot that would take you? ARGH. I've now learned to never procrastinate this task again! BUT The Canal Club, being the awesome place that they are, saved the day! 

We came here with a party of 6 for Mother's Day brunch and had a delightful time! The ambiance is SO fab, with tropical decor and hip touches. We had a great table in the corner next to windows with natural light. Our server was very friendly and compared to other resort brunches in the Valley, the prices are very right here! (No $75 per head like most resorts!). You just pay for what you eat/drink.

I ordered their avocado toast to start (with no eggs) and it was so so tasty! The bread was pretty dreamy. It would be fantastic with eggs, I just wasn't feeling them that day. I loved the pickled onions on top. For my entree, I ordered their Cobb Salad and it was so filling. The dressing was amazing and definitely homemade - a ranch with some added zest. I love a good hearty salad and The Canal Club cured that craving! I also sampled their purple potato hash and oh my goodness, so yummy!

I will definitely come back for brunch or dinner another time soon. :) I would also love to try some of their fresh cocktails, they look amazing!"}
{"text":"Walking into The Canal Club is like falling into a modern Cuban dream, and I never want to leave.

But I did, because I'm sure they would've accused me of squatting at some point. I mean, I'm not Tom Hanks and this isn't the movie Airport. Oh, wait, that movie was apparently called The Terminal. What?! Really? I could've sworn it was Airport. Maybe I switched places with another dimension's Morgan? I walked into this swanky bar, and boom, everything I know is just slightly wrong. 

Whatever, the Cuban sandwiches are the same. Or are they?

Take your hot date or your old friend, and let your minds wander together. You can get lost in projections of old Latin films while pretending you're on vacation and living in an alternative reality. One where you don't have to work tomorrow. You're welcome. 

¬°Buen viaje!"}
{"text":"I had a business lunch here last week and really enjoyed the experience.  The resort is under new ownership and they are completely transforming the entire place with a Cuban theme.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated and makes you feel like you are in Miami.  The service is professional and efficient and the food was quite tasty.  I thoroughly enjoyed my cubano with a side of fries...I'll definitely be craving this again and again!  Excited to come back for drinks and enjoy the great bar too!"}
{"text":"Got the castros Cubano and it was amazing! I love the food and atmosphere here! It's such a lovey place for dates or hang out with friends with such a great food. Everyone is super friendly and helpful which makes the experience memorable!"}
{"text":"This isn't a steak place but it had the best steak I have ever had..... i split the posted picture with my wife. Also just so happened to have the best Cobb salad I have ever had as well. Place was amazing... couldn't believe the quality, and how delicious the food is."}
{"text":"The canal club is a modern, swanky hang out that gives you the feeling of being on vacay.  Seeing by and use their wifi anytime.  They welcome you for a sip of coffee or your favorite tropical delight."}
{"text":"Horrible service ok food. 

Should've known when we stood at the hostess desk for 5 mins without seeing anyone but the bar tenders, who were not helpful. (Only one other table occupied)

They were out of the ingredients to make their signature drink. They brought out three out of four dishes our group had ordered.  so, the fourth person sat without eating for 15 mins longer. By the time they brought out the last entree we were half way through our lunch. Awful. 

And don't even think about getting a refill on tea/water or soda. 

They added a $13 drink to our bill that we didn't order. 

We wanted to try desert but we waited 15 mins for the waitress to come take our order. By then we were done with place. 

Food that we tried was ok. Will not be back, sorry I wasted so much time here."}
{"text":"The Canal Club is such a little gem! I love trying new places and this was a great find. The service was great, the ambiance is amazing, and the drinks/food are delicious! Definitely worth the price, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"1) Decor is gorgeous!
2) Bar was extremely sllllllllowwww!! ...and although tiny, didn't acknowledge my presence by saying they would get with me or ask if I wanted something
3) Service at table was sssssllllllllow as well. We had a table of drinkers and eaters. If the waitress was on it, (cuz she had no reason not to be- the restaurant was empty, and I now know, personally, why it would be!) we would've ordered 3x more drinks. Food was slow to come out also!!!!!
I won't be back. Wayyyy to many food options (COMPETITION) in the Phoenix Metropolitan area to put up with poor customer service ESPECIALLY AT A HIGH END RESTAURANT IN A FANCEE PENTS HOTEL. (Disappointed!)"}
{"text":"So we walked over to Roaring Fork from Postino's. Just look at my review of them to see how that worked out. So we tried to salvage our evening by coming back across the street to Canal Club.  Thank God for them. Made us feel welcome on a Wednesday night. Great drinks! Had the gaucho steak! Amazing. There were some great people and great times. Thanks for that!"}
{"text":"Went last night with my husband and two friends. This was the first time there for all of us and we were excited! We made reservations for 7:30pm and showed up a couple of minutes prior. Beautiful bar area outside of the restaurant proper, gorgeous lobby at the hotel. There was no one at the host stand and we waited...waited...waited. A line of other diners formed behind us and someone finally came over. That's when we were informed that it was going to be a twenty minute wait *with* our reservation. Okayyyyyy.  There appeared to be about three tables inside with customers, lots of empty space. We were not given any reasoning for the wait. We stepped aside and watched as the groups behind us were told about the same, and they walked away looking confused as well. 

When we were seated outside, water was brought and drinks ordered. Drinks came, we ordered a couple of starters for the table. Food was ok, nothing remarkable. We put in our dinner order and I was told they were out of my choice. Cool, a heads up would have been nice when our server had come over the first time. Picked a different meal and moved on. 

Here's where it went off, water was never refilled and it was a warm night. Server never offered to take orders for another round of drinks. When our meals came out, they were brought by another staff member who noticed our drinks were empty and offered to put in an order for another round. We all said yes and ordered, also asking for more water. Water never showed, nor could we find anyone to ask. A group was sat behind us and at one point one member of their party went inside to grab a server. Our drinks came after we had completely finished our meals. After about ten minutes after finishing the drinks finally showed andIt was our server stated that round was in the house.  we asked if they were short staffed and she said that they were and that they hadn't expected so many people as there were only four reservations on the books. The hell?? It was a Friday night, the restaurant sits off a hotel lobby with a great bar (and the bar was busy), and the restaurant is understaffed??  Time to get it together people. Honestly, not sure we will come back. Decor is beautiful, but the food was just ok and service lacking. Honestly, if they had just stated up front that they were short staffed, not a problem. However, with no communication, barely there servers, and basic things like refilling waters, it wasn't that great."}
{"text":"We wanted to explore some new brunch spots and this one stood out with the unique decor and ambience. Turned out the design of the restaurant and the hotel in general lived up to our expectation. 

I ordered the Peruvian Hash with purple potato hash, over easy egg and green Chile chicken. My friend had the same dish with pulled pork. The dish was great, especially with the crispy purple potato hash which adds texture to the dish and also a little sweetness in order to balance the salty chicken and spicy sauce. I wish the egg was taken out of the pan two seconds earlier so the egg yolk would have more liquid which could add more moisture to this whole dish. 

We shared the churro doughnut holes which tasted great with the whole chocolate anglaise and guava jam. One sweet and one sour. Both sauces are good. The rum+coconut+mint was so refreshing - highly recommend! U need to order from the bar since it was not on the brunch menu.

 The only issue was customer services. I had to ask the waiter to add water to my glass for three times. They were not that busy (only abt 3 tables) so they should be able to see my empty glass and add water accordingly. 

Overall, I would go bk to this place and try other dishes!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a relaxing feel, I'd recommend dining here and staying here. Their food was good and their drink is a must. Came here for a Yelp event and enjoyed every minute of what the place has to offer!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the most
Amazing experience at The Scott this evening. What was a happy hour double date turned into an incredible three course meal. We were pleasantly surprised to find that we were still enjoying happy hour prices on craft cocktails and apps until 7 pm. We loved the ceviche app and the rum cocktails. YUM! We then had the short rib and steak. The churro donuts were a must. The staff was amazing about catering to my husbands gluten free celiac needs. The atmosphere is romantic and tropical. Multiple seating nooks and fire pits throughout. We loved it and will be back soon! Can not believe we have my frequented this hidden gem! It is a new hot spot on our date night list!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  A succinct menu but enough options. I had the Vegetable Paella. Several items I would go back for.  I'll definitely be trying their breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"The newly opened Canal Club at The Scott Resort is swanky cool. If you expect the Scott to be anything like the old Fire and Sky Resort you'll be pleasantly surprised. The $15 million renovation shows. Imagine Key West or Miami in Scottsdale and you'll start to get an image in your mind. 

They have a largely Latino influence throughout the restaurant and menu. The Cuban sandwiches are delicious and hands down the best Cuban sandwich I've eaten in the Valley of the Sun. The ceviche is delightful and yummy with a complex variety of flavors that explode in your mouth. Their signature drink The Hemingway was delightful and hit the spot after a warm day in the Arizona sun. 

Their desserts are rich, flavorful and yummy!  

This is a new must enjoy place in Scottsdale. I'll be back soon and I'm sure I may find a cubby to work from during the day."}
{"text":"Solid. Balanced cocktails, on point with tropical vibe. Food good, but sandwiches slightly pricy for south Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Started with ceviche which was served with plantain chips. Cocktails were excellent. Main course- Chicken was excellent the vegetable paella was very good. great ambience by the pool with lighting just right."}
{"text":"This is based on the service and lack of staff, we came for my best friend's birthday and had previously made a reservation for 15 people. You'd think they'd have more staff right? They had one poor waitress (not that it's her fault) for both inside and outside guests by the pool as this restaurant is inside a hotel.. Also to add to that they had ONE of the slowest bartenders ever literally took me about 30min kid you not for ONE cocktail. I get it they're fancy cocktails and take more time, but if you know you have a group of 15 guests (who would've spent a lot more $$$ drinking) why only have ONE bartender working for the inside and entire outside pool guests?!! Also it was really hot in he building itself, the food was good, I wish I would've been able to try more cocktails. They need to hire more people!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night to try out what I have been told is an awesome beverage program.  I was definitely not disappointed.  We sat at the bar for a bit (which had a super cute pink neon sign btw), and had a Salt River Society, Mmmmm...mezcal, and a Green Bird, Mmmmmm...gin.  I'm not easily impressed, so I was thrilled to see that the bartenders knew what they were doing.  We wandered around the lobby a bit after receiving our next round, and found out that they were hosting a game night.  Not many places in AZ are embracing the Backgammon and Dominoes come back, so it was cool to see that they offered a pretty cool place to learn and participate...with HAPPY HOUR PRICING extended to those who are playing!  Wednesday for the win!  I'll be back.  Thanks guys."}
{"text":"We stopped in for brunch and had a great experience. I had the avocado toast and a Helen & Maude (rum, coconut, & lime) cocktail. The food was delicious and we love the decor, it feels like a mini vacation break right here in town."}
{"text":"Resort and hotel have been redone very nicely with great decoration and nice pool. Perfect for visitors who want to experiece Scottsdale on a great location. Cuban restaurant has a great setting and view, but i was not too excited about the brunch food.. not because of the menu, but because it the food wasnt really cuban or close to it."}
{"text":"I've already planned my return. 
It made my whole weekend to come and enjoy a few hours here. The hotel. The aesthetic, it's beyond beautiful. It's relaxing yet romantically casual. My review is based on food, service and drink. There is slight room for improvement on the mechanics of service, a few kinks to work out and discretion of employee conversation. 
However, the food and drink make up for whatever mishaps we noticed. 
The Cubano sandwhich is mouthwatering!!! 
Hold the phone...... 
If you are reading this, order the Cubano!! 
The pickled onion and pork is heavenly!!! 
*smacks lips*
If we weren't running errands afterward I would have taken one to go so I could enjoy at home later on for dinner. 
The drinks were deliciously strong, just how you would enjoy them in South Beach. We ordered 3 different cocktails and all were impressive and did not lack in taste. 
The churro donut holes complimented the end of meal and he two dipping sauce options were nostalgic because the guava jam they brought out reminded me of Miami and ordering Guava every and anything I could find. I have a true love for all things Guava."}
{"text":"Good food and good ambiance but horrible service. Waited close to 45 minutes for our drinks. We received cocktails with our food which is unacceptable. Our waitress expressed that it was really busy but... did not look busy,  maybe under staffed, there were empty tables everywhere but not sure what was going on. The only reason I am giving this place a 2 star is because the food was really good."}
{"text":"Really nice place to hangout with friends or impress a date. Love the atmosphere and the waiters are great too. Ask them for their favorite drinks and don't be hesitant to try them out."}
{"text":"Food overall was really good! Wife had salmon and I had the steak! The potato cakes were awesome. We each had a couple of the specialty drinks which were tasty. Service was good. Donuts were a great way to top off our meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant has some great Cuban sandwiches 
From the Castro's Cuban to the Pulled Chicken Torta Sandwich....Fantastic! They also have Cuban inspired drinks which were great tasting. Clean environment, indoor and outdoor seating with fireplace and pool views. The service was also Great!"}
{"text":"Fabulous cocktails and ambiance saved this hotel restaurant. Food is very overpriced and server is subpar. Came in just for dinner expecting a lot more out of them."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good but not the best for Cuban food. The atmosphere was great though! If you are chilling at the resort then it is a good place to eat at!"}
{"text":"We love Canal Club and have been here multiple times. It's the place we got engaged and we love the decor and ambience of the resort. The resort is really beautiful, but it's such a shame that somewhere management is lacking.

Today's visit was the 2nd time where we've had subpar service. We have tried really hard to ignore the slow service on multiple occasions but after today, we aren't sure if we will come back any time soon. 

In the past, we've been in for drinks and brunch, but because of AZ Restaurant Week we thought it was a great opportunity to try the dinner menu. Unfortunately, when we were seated the hostess told us that they had run out of the Bass that was on the set menu for AZ Restaurant Week. No problem, we weren't even going to order the bass. We asked if they were still honoring the event menu and she said we'd have to talk to the server. We waited for the server for 10 minutes just for her to tell us that they were out of the bass and we could order the other menus A La Cart but that they weren't honoring AZ Restaurant Week because they had run out of bass. 

First of all, the past couple of times we can tell that they are understaffed. The wait times for ordering and food are so long and that is something you can't do when your entree prices are over $15.  

Second, the management should have just told us they weren't honoring the event menu and pricing instead of using the bass as an excuse. We didn't even want it.

Today was very disappointing as we have been consistent returning guests."}
{"text":"After having attended a Yelp Elite Event at the Canal Club a few months ago, I decided to celebrate my birthday here. I was so impressed by the trendy Cuban decor and hand-crafted drinks, that I couldn't wait to find a reason to come back with my friends. Needless to say, I think my friends were equally impressed.  

For my birthday celebration, we reserved a table for 9 in the dining area for dinner.  Because I am trying to watch what I eat, I ordered the Gaucho Steak Salad. As I watched my friends drool over their Cuban sandwiches and fries, I thoroughly enjoyed my salad and didn't feel extreme guilt  afterwards. After feeling proud of my somewhat healthy entree selection, our wonderful server Will, brought me out a surprise dessert for my birthday, the Tres Leches Jar (AMAZING coconut goodness). It was well worth the added calories. After dinner, my friends and I headed to the super chill lounge area for drinks.  It was a great place to sit, relax and chat with friends without the loud, crowded atmosphere of a bar/club. Did I mention this place is located inside The Scott Hotel? You would never know it's here unless you heard about it from friends or Yelp. I feel like The Canal Club is a little hidden gem in Scottsdale. 

The only minor negative to the night was that the service was kind of slow. However, I sense the staff really takes their time to make sure your food and drinks are perfect.

P.S. Ladies, make sure you check out the restroom. There's cute wallpaper in there begging for you to take selfies with it."}
{"text":"The Canal Club is the new hotel restaurant at the Scott, formerly FireSky resort.  An extensive remodel throughout the resort has made this a beautiful but intimate place to stay in Scottsdale.  We ate breakfast here twice, and both times enjoyed attentive service on the patio, and delicious meals with a slightly Cuban flair.  You'll find avocado toast, a delicious vegetarian farro grain bowl, and of course, bacon. The egg dishes came with either a purple potato hash or tostones (fried plantain.)  Egg sandwiches, including a cuban version with smoked brisket also make for a hearty meal.  Alas, we did not have time to eat dinner here, so I can't speak to that side of the menu.  The bar in the lobby makes delicious cocktails; this would be a great place to come for a drink even if you weren't staying here!"}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant inside the Scott resort! Stopped in for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. The ambiance is wonderful, some live music would make this place  a great hangout. Service was excellent, and our food came out quickly! I ordered the pulled chicken torta sandwich (no bread, or cheese) and loved it! The chicken was flavorful, and the simple arugula salad was dressed to perfection. Also happily shared the plantain chips with my hubby - delicious. We enjoyed our first time in and will be back! The brunch menu looks lovely!"}
{"text":"We are in Scottsdale for our 1 year wedding anniversary and are staying at the scott.  I saw that there was a restaurant on the property and after a long day of travel and Cubs game we just wanted to sit down and eat.  We ate on the patio and it was a little chilly so a server sprung into action and pulled over a giant heater for us! So awesome!  The food was amazing! Service was on point!  I absolutely recommend the Canal Club!"}
{"text":"So my best friend got engaged at the Scott resort & we decided to have brunch at the Canal club after. First and foremost the food, service, and quality were all a 10/10. I got the Castro Cubano & I was so happy that I did because it was extremely delicious and they give you A LOT of meat. I usually worry at places because they don't give you enough meat but the sandwich was huge and it was worth all the money. Definitely was a great end to the engagement & the space they provided for us was wonderful."}
{"text":"Food was good but not great.   Portions were just right.  Not too much not to little.  What made me give this place 4 stars is the service I received from Rubi.  She's outstanding and came to our table several times to make sure we were ok.  I think she's the manager.  Our server Brie was also excellent."}
{"text":"The drinks were good the service was awful, my girlfriend and I came in when it was, how do you call it..slow. Not sure if it was our servers fault or miscommunication between the bar. Took roughly 30-45 minutes for our drinks, we weren't asked what we wanted to each within that period of waiting for our drinks it was until after our drinks were delivered that we were asked what we want to eat. We figured since it took so long for our drinks the kitchen would be the same with all of the miscommunication. There was no accommodation at the end."}
