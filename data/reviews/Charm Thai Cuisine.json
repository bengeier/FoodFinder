{"text":"Very nice place to eat great thai food! The food is always good and the thai iced tea? AMAZING! They can get very busy! So if you can, make a reservation, but they have always been able to get me a table even without reservation, for valentines day, they were kind enough and gave us a complimentary cake after our meal!"}
{"text":"The place is nice and cozy. Food is very good for the price. Service was good as well. My wife had the drunken noodles with jumbo prawns and I had the spicy gra pow fried rice with chicken. We both went with medium spicy, which was perfect for us. Both dishes were really good."}
{"text":"Exceeded our expectations.  Ordered the chicken basil leaf, pad thai, panang curry, and veggie fried rice.  We asked for no fish sauce and for the first time, ever, at a Thai restaurant, there was no hint of fish sauce   food was excellent, a little sweeter than we like it but still fantastic.  Sooooo delish!  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"The food is decent but it in no way compensates for the unbelievably slow service. I just came here for lunch and it took them about 15 minutes to even ask for our order. (There were only about four other parties in the entire restaurant. ) By the time we were able to order we had to switch from dine in to take out because of the delay. After 30 minutes the food still had not come. They did not apologize, did not ask if we wanted to order drinks, etc. I am pretty patient but this was completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Ive done take out at this restaurant but it's very good and consistent every time.  The staff is nice and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Not only is the food enjoyable but you can feel the pride with both service and in each dish.  Everything tasted so fresh.  We will definitely return time and again."}
{"text":"Charm Thai is a great place for a fresh and healthy lunch.

I'm hooked on the drunken noodles but love their curries also.

Definitely worth a stop. (and the check-in deal is greatly appreciated. Thx. Charm Thai)"}
{"text":"A few family members and I came to this restaurant today at noon.  There were two tables filled in the front section and possibly 2-3 more in the side area of the restaurant.  I believe there were only two servers.  We got water and waited 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order.  We waited and waited and finally asked the male waiter where our waitress was and he said \"she's busy\".  We asked if we could please have our drinks.  We eventually got them.  We then placed our order and one of the appetizers was not available so we opted for just the spring rolls.  We then waited another 45 minutes for our food.  My entree was OK, my daughter's was mild when she requested medium heat and my grandson's was too hot to eat and he had ordered mild.  We elected to just pay the bill and leave because we really didn't want to wait another 45 minutes to have anything redone.  We also cleared our own table (actually moved stuff to the table next to us)  since we were getting the entrees when we still had the soup cups on the table.  We had empty beverage glasses and had to flag the waiter down to get a refill.  

Your food and service has been slipping over the last year.  My daughter and I used to come there regularly, but unless we have lots of time, it's just not going to happen.  I can't help but notice that you don't have anywhere near the crowd at lunch you once had.  People in that area are all working folks and if they can't get in and out of there in 40 minutes, they're going to make a different choice.  There are so many good restaurants downtown to choose from.

You've lost our business."}
{"text":"We've come here often, and the service is always a little slow but worth the wait because the food is tasty. Tonight though was a disaster. We were seated after about ten minutes of waiting, despite a number of empty tables (we had a reservation which we were early for, so understandable). Servers were really friendly but incredibly inattentive. After being seated, we waited a good twenty minutes plus for someone to take our order, watching the servers prioritize taking orders from tables that came in after us and didn't have a reservation. We had been here for nearly an hour before we got our food, and it came out nearly cold. We still haven't left as we are again waiting on slow service. If you're reading this, we may still be stuck here, waiting for our check..."}
{"text":"First time here and had the pad see ew with shrimp lunch special.  Also ordered a Thai ice tea to go.  The portion was very filling and a great deal for the price.  I've had lots of experience eating Ono to not so Ono Thai food and Charm Thai is up there I have to say.  Bringing the wife to enjoy their food very soon!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food! Truly is a charming place to have a meal too. Excellent service and in a fun part of town!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a Saturday night. It was a complete disappointment, mostly cause of their horrible service. The server seemed very frustrated and didn't care about providing a decent service.

We ordered papaya salad and it just \"looked\" like papaya salad. The taste was completely off with almond pieces instead of garlic. It seemed like they had probably seen a photo of the papaya salad somewhere and thought they could make it. 
Besides, we ordered it with no prawns but it was served with prawns on the top. The server said she could take it back, remove the prawns, and bring it back. Appreciate the honesty, but we did not need to hear that.

Drunken noodles and duck curry were alright, but I have had better."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, but quite poor service.  Will probably give it one more try due to the fabulous coconut shrimp, but based on yelp and google reviews it sounds like they are not responding to the repeated reviews of poor service.  It would be a shame for them to fail simply because their waiters are incompetent."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to Charm Thai because of all the great Yelp reviews.  Six of us came in for dinner at around 6:30 PM and one joined at 6:40 PM.  There were 6 other people in the place when we arrived.  Our waiter took drink orders and came back about 5 minutes later with the drinks.  Our 7th person had arrived by then.  Our waiter took his drink order but didn't return for well over 15 minutes.

He set the drink down and as my wife was saying we were ready to order, he turned around walked away.  We finally flagged down a different waiter about 10 minutes later and said we were ready to order.  Our waiter arrived after about 5 minutes and took food orders, but didn't ask if anyone wanted more drinks.

Nearly 15 minutes later, the appetizers arrived... as did my wife's meal.  We all encouraged her to eat while it was hot, thinking the remainder would be out shortly.  Another 10+ minutes went by before the rest of the meals arrived, except for mine.  Now I encouraged everyone to eat while their meals were hot.  They said the food was good, but not great.

Another 10+ minutes goes by.  No one comes by to see if our meals are ok, we need more drinks, or notice that I didn't have anything to eat.  We finally flagged down a different waiter that we were missing an order.  About 5 minutes later, our waiter says he doesn't know what happened but the kitchen is starting my order.  Starting!  By then, everyone else is nearly finished so I told him to cancel it.  He said \"Ok\" and walked off.  No attempt at \"We're very sorry,\" or \"We're even the slightest bit sorry.\"

Everyone had finished their meals when the other waiter came with a to-go box containing my meal.  All he said was \"No charge.\"  Still no apology, and no attempt to ask if we wanted anything else.

Another 10+ minutes went by before we were able to flag down yet another waiter to ask for the check.  By then, my to-go dinner was stone cold.

After the pathetic service we had received, I intended to leave a 5 cent tip.  Imagine my surprise to find that an 18% gratuity had already been included.  By then, I was so disgusted that we paid the bill, but as we were leaving, my son went into the kitchen to discuss the automatic 18%.  They said it should not have been included.  We gave them my credit card and I signed the receipt for a refund of the tip ($32).  Two weeks later, still no refund on my AMEX.

Food: Meh
Service:  Horrible
Integrity:  Nonexistent
Summary:  Epic Fail"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time to eating Crab fired rice and Pa tai. The meals were so good. I liked the spicy smell. So surprised, the crab was big and chewy. Undoubtedly, you could feel the real crab. They were awesome. Besides, I also liked the service here."}
{"text":"My wife and I walked by last night and saw this spot, so we decided to try it out today. The decor is pretty nice inside but we sat on the patio because it was so beautiful outside. We tried the fish cakes and they were great! I love the presentation of them. We also ordered to Prik King Salmon and the Spicy Holy Basil Eggplant. The food was very well prepared and tasted great! We will definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant after the Tumbleweed tree lighting festivities for dinner based on the reviews. The food was fine but the service left little to be desired. There were five tables filled including ours, and our order didn't get placed until the table after us was seated. When we asked for our leftovers to be placed in two boxes it was placed in one. One of us happens to be deathly allergic to crab. Honestly we have had Thai food that was about the same quality but cheaper and faster."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever had! My boyfriend and I are new to the area and have been looking for local restaurants to eat at. We found Charm Thai on Yelp, it came up as #1 in our area! We were not disappointed! I had the Pad See Ew, it was incredible! My boyfriend got the Coconut Crab Fried Rice and neither of us could stop eating it! Service, from Christian, was excellent and fast! We will absolutely be back here! Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Certainly, one of the best Thai food I had. Prices are reasonable and service is great."}
{"text":"I've had take-out from here for lunch several times.  I call my order in and I always give them more time to get the food ready since it seems to take longer than they say. The quality of the food tastes yummy.  The prices are a little high compared to other Thai places around town. I enjoy the food and it's a nice option for downtown Chandler lunch places."}
{"text":"This Thai Restaurant is awesome!!! I eaten here a number of times since moving to Chandler with my wife and it has never disappointed us, they always bring their A game. The staff are fantastic and so are the lychee martinis! Delicious Curry's and the Pad Thai is my favorite. Charm is so worth a visit!"}
{"text":"So happy to have find this place. Our favorite coffee joint is next door which is how we discovered Thai Charm. We have been twice and each time we have ordered the Prik King. Delicious. We look forward to eating our way through the menu. If you've never had fresh coconut juice, may we suggest ordering one! You will love it!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite Thai places in the Valley!

Be forewarned, their Hot is most restaurants' Superhot!

Our favorite dishes are the Yellow Curry (especially with additional vegetables), the Massassman Short Rib Curry, the Summer Rolls, and the Pad Thai (our kids' favorite).

The service is always super friendly and the menu is reasonably priced. Its a great place for a semi-nice dinner with family and friends."}
{"text":"I LOVE IT! Trust me. I'm a Malaysian living near the Thailand border so I'm used to dining with Thai cuisine. And this place serves the best of it. My recommendation, the Red Duck Curry. Taste the lychee in the curry. It is amazing. And of you are adventurous enough, go for Drunken Noodles with Thai level's spiciness. 


And that male server with glasses, he's cute."}
{"text":"Great service, Great Food! I've been to Thailand 7 times and trust me, this place will scratch the itch for Thai food in all of its unique flavors! So glad to have this place in Chandler!"}
{"text":"This the best Thai Food in the Phoenix area & I've eaten at many. I love  Thai Food & have eaten it restaurants all over the country. I especially like that they use such fresh ingredients & you can really taste it in their dishes. They are especially accommodating to special dietary restrictions. I love  Charm Thai."}
{"text":"This place is a charm indeed! Our service was excellent and the food fresh and delicious. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food fresh and fully cooked great service good value
Love the yellow curry with chicken big portion also you will not leave hungry best Thai iced tee"}
{"text":"Had 5 people in our party on a rainy Friday night. Place is very small so waited 20 minutes just to be seated.  Service was slow and not attentive even though there were lots of empty tables.  Food came out in spurts rather than together for the group.  Food was hot but tasted marginal at best.  Some items were more spicey than we expected.  When server asked how things tasted we told him but he said OK and walked away.  Now I don't expect anyone to give me anything for no charge but at least ask if you can get me something else to eat.  We will not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place for Saturday night dinner.  After driving by about a 1000 times I finally gave it a try and wish I would have tried this place much earlier."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 portions of pad Thai and 1 yellow curry to go. I'm quite disappointed in the quality of chicken that was given in the dishes. They both tasted as though the chicken was OLD, It should have been thrown out. A person can taste a difference between the two. I'm really disappointed as I was looking forward to finding a local Thai place close to home."}
{"text":"Very cute little place in downtown Chandler!

I've seen Charm Thai several times, but I only recently made it inside.  We opted for takeout since everyone was exhausted and the baby was headed for a meltdown.  The restaurant had barely opened for dinner when we sat down, so it was pretty empty still.  A server happily delivered menus and was very knowledgeable about their dishes.  He made recommendations and answered questions, and was very patient with my very tired mommy-brain.  If that's any indication of dine-in service, we're in good shape!

Once home, we dug in to our coconut wraps, pad thai, spring rolls, sticky rice and pumpkin curry.  Everything was fantastic and flavorful.  The coconut wraps were a little bit spicier than I'd prefer but the flavor was so good that I powered through.  Everything else we asked for \"mild and a half\" and I noticed zero heat.  We could probably go up a level next time.  

The only reason I'm holding back on the 5th star is because I haven't dined in yet.  Don't worry, I will do that as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"I love their food here. A little more on the pricey side but totally worth it! The staff is friendly and quick to get your drinks and food. One of my more favorite places to go :)"}
{"text":"First visit to this restaurant in downtown Chandler. Arrived around 6p on a weeknight and had choice of seating, inside and patio.  Decided on the exterior and glad we did. Very pleasant evening temps, but traffic a bit loud. Also quite close to sidewalk but had some small planters as a buffer between pedestrians and our table, although we got to visit with some cute puppies strolling by! Waiter was attentive and food was prompt. Ordered the six crispy spring rolls as an appetizer which were small but tasty and the afore mentioned crispy! For main course, chose drunken noodles with shrimp, medium heat, and pad see ew with vegetables, mild. Both selections perfectly sized portions, not too much, not to skimpy. Medium heat selection brought some tears while the mild was flavorful without much heat. Also tried the Thai tea which was pretty and yummy!  There was music inside and out to enjoy. Very pleasant restaurant and nice experience. We will return and look forward to different selections!"}
{"text":"This is the first time here and we'll definitely come back but, my meal could have been better. I had the 5 Spice Pork and requested medium heat. It wasn't as spicy as I was expecting. There was ample pork but the amount of veggies could have been more because I ran out of them and was left with half of the pork and broth with rice.
My wife's Yellow Curry with Salmon was good. She requested Mild and after tasting my pork she thought her's was spicier. Maybe they mixed up the spice request.
Overall, not bad. We'll be back to kick up the spice abit."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but the service that I received today was horrible!!!! My party and I came during the lunch rush and expected to have slower service. We didn't prepare to be completely ignored for the first five minutes. The hostess finally acknowledges us, after walking past us 3 times, and ask us how many people are in our party. She walked away and kept us waiting for another five minutes and we finally told them where we were going to sit. After we took our seat we were handed our menus and water and our order wasn't taken for another 15 minutes. When we received our order, 20 minutes later, they forgot to bring out one of the entrees. We waited another 15 minutes for the final entree. Another 20 minutes later and we're all done eating and no check so I ask for the check. When no one came back for the payment I walked up to the front to pay and to be told that they rung up our order wrong and it would cost more than what was on the receipt. I payed and waited for my card and asked for boxes. The waitress told me that she would have to box up our meals. 10 minutes later and we ended up walking out without our leftovers. I really wished that our experience was better because the food was great. I'd recommend coming during a slower time."}
{"text":"We tried this place I and thought it was the best Thai I ever ate.  Service great.  Atmosphere is very relaxing.  Its a but pricey but reasonable for the quality.  We will go back.  Nice place to take a night out with friends."}
{"text":"Have been here several times, but today's lunch experience was awful. Sweet but understaffed servers, both had filthy tennis shoes and struggled to explain what has to be the most confusing menu ever written. Overheard one couple getting the wrong dish after waiting 20 minutes, and another trying to understand the menu as we did. Soup that comes with lunch essentially clear liquid with a boil lion cube waived over it. yuk. Hope they get their act together as they once did!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times, food was OK...not the best.

Slow services...even though they're not busy.

Pricier than other Thai restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Horrible service! After drinks were recieved, food order was taken. Took awhile for app to arrive. Then after a lengthy wait, asked how long for food. Told just about done. Waiter came back a minute late to ask what we ordered.....Not good! They forgot the order. Was told patio was busy, that was why the delay. Not! Watched others get food that ordered well after we did. Tell me the truth! Hardly saw waiter the whole time. Horrible horrible service. Never again!"}
{"text":"Disappointing! Nice presentation on the food, but absolutely no flavor at all. Totally unimpressed. However, I do have to acknowledge that the place was cute and very clean, the location is great and the service was good. When we told our server we didn't care for the food, she kindly apologized and took an entree off the bill."}
{"text":"Many gluten free options!

I waited till I've been here twice so I could try more dishes.  This restaurant really understands gluten free.  We had the Massamun Curry (with beef) and it was so delicious.  Also have tried the Green Curry with eggplant and tofu.  This was also very good and we couldn't decide which one we liked better.  Everything is made from scratch and you pick the heat level.  There was no problems due to allergies changing different ingredients.  They are very accommodating.  For starters we tried the summer spring rolls with shrimp which were on the happy hour menu.  Those were so good we almost ordered a second round.

The atmosphere is very pleasant and the whole front of the restaurant is glass so nice views and very open.  The service was very good for us both times.

We will definitely return and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to friends.  Keep in mind it's one of those restaurants that closes between lunch and dinner.  It doesn't open until 5 pm for dinner."}
{"text":"It was my husband and I's first time here, and we'll defiantly be coming back. Although my only disappointment was the fact that I ordered shrimp in my pad Thai and received three pieces of it - and was charged 4$! So next time, we'll stick to chicken haha."}
{"text":"Food was tasty, great ambience. Service could've  been better, our waitress wasn't very attentive."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Intimate dining spaces as the beautiful aroma of Thai food cooking drifts through the place. The appetizers were delicious and everything was very fresh and delicious. We got our favorite, yellow curry and it was amazingly good. I will go back many more times. Staff was friendly and courteous"}
{"text":"Food is very fresh and tasty. Tom Yum soup is excellent. Mango salad with fish is very fresh. Thai Basil is very good too. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Food was generally ok, not fantastic.  Service was really slow considering that there were 3 or 4 parties of customers in the restaurant and 2 waitstaff.  We asked if a dish had shrimp because of a shellfish allergy, and were told that it didn't.  When the dish arrived, there were clearly shrimp/prawns in it, and when we asked about it, we were told that they were prawns, not shrimp, and that they were actually considered meat (really???).  After an awkward stare-off with the waiter, I proceeded to cut the spring roll in such a way that my wife could have the portions that did not have prawns, with my pocket knife because they don't have knives that can cut.  The dishes that came after were ok, and we waited a very long time to ask for the check.  I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I have tasted anywhere.  They have a great lunch menu with reasonable pricing.  They also have 6 taps for fresh and delicious beer on draft including Sapporo!  Service was excellent. They do have outdoor seating for when the weather is nice.  Spiciness is custom to your order - I prefer medium hot."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. What a disappointment. Very bland food. Gross molded rice glob. Heat level 1 thru 5. Asked for a 3. No heat at all. Very clean. Server was polite but not very helpful. The only reason I didn't rate it ZERO!"}
{"text":"Food is very good and service was quick!   A hidden little gem in downtown Chandler!  If you like Thai food, you need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Good was fabulous. Will come here when're I'm in downtown Chandler. Ordered green curry w/ chicken, papaya salad, spring rolls & coconut wraps (the best things I've eaten in a long time. Those raps are AMAZING!! Tom was our server. What a pleasant polite & efficient server. He was very knowledgeable about the menu. Charm will not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch! Food was very flavorful & presented well. Service excellent. Nice atmosphere with calming music. An experience worth repeating."}
{"text":"Ok food, poor service, unfriendly staff and way too pricey! We definitely will not be back!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, the pricing reasonable and the service is always with a smile and good Costomer service"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that my wife and I stumbled into one Saturday afternoon; it was mostly empty at that time, so we weren't sure if that was any indication of quality or whatnot, but we were shown to a table, ordered, and had a wonderful meal.  Charm Thai is one of the only places we've been able to find locally that have these delicious fish cakes (as an appetizer) which we love and we introduced to in another Thai place (which sadly closed); and that's primarily why we've gone back.  The entrees are good, though I'll admit we haven't experimented too much with their menu and have gone for largely items we've some familiarity with.  Prices are reasonable, especially given the location and portion sizes (pretty good), so they're definitely on our \"go to\" list."}
{"text":"After a disappointing experience at Thai Rama found this little gem of a Thai food spot in downtown Chandler. My new fav Thai place. Everything was so tasty! Pad see Ew, Pad Thai, comp soup broth to start. Thai Tea in a mason jar. I could use less mason jar cuteness and more Thai Tea in a bigger vessel but I suppose I'm just a greedy little bastard! Lol!  Fried Rice was really good !!  I ate the whole thing I took no food prisoners! This place has a nice clean, modern look. I liked it. I liked it. Good work! Keep it up cooks and staff."}
{"text":"Very long wait for lunch time, it took them
10 min to acknowledge me and 45 minutes to bring my food. On top of that they forgot to give me my egg rolls and soup. Very unfriendly people."}
{"text":"Wow! The food here is spectacular! This location has free parking off the street two doors down. This place has a great vibe too. The staff is friendly, efficient and sweet. The food was spectacular and the portion size was ample. The food presentation was terrific and they have a good happy hour!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for early dinner after shopping trip. Atmosphere is casual, nothing to remember.Definitely recommend the Happy Hour 5-7PM almost half price certain appetizers and wine. House Riesling was fresh. Coconut shrimp was tasty, large and fresh. Fried Calamari made fresh but a bit tough. Shared Thai fried rice with salmon. Salmon well prepared. Rice nothing out of ordinary. On waiters recommendation ordered \"spicy # 2\". Would suggest at least a 3 if you want to experience some bite."}
{"text":"I was visiting from the San Francisco Bay Area to catch up with old friends.  Was in the mood for Thai. My friend said there is a place in Chandler we can go to. Sure why not, local people should know right? Sorry, no offense or not trying to be a snob but the flavors did not come to par with what is expected of Thai food. Cooking flat rice noodle is a good gauge to the skill level of the cook, so I ordered Pad Kee Mao Moo or Drunken Noodles with Pork. Let's just say it was just average. Got a free drink for checking in. My friend ask, that is cool how you can get a free drink! My answer is if they need to give a free drink, it is indicative of the business that it may mean it not so good and need a lure. My overall review is it is not a bad place, not a good one, but if I can find a better place, there I will go."}
{"text":"Amazing vibe! Food was so tasty and fresh. Green beans were amazing in the basil chicken .love the soup too !"}
{"text":"Great service from the moment we called to make dinner reservations. The menu was diverse and the wine was reasonably priced. The food was delicious, especially the sticky rice and green tea dessert. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here last weekend. I LOVE Thai food and I am always on the look out for great new places. Charm was amazing. We were greeted by our waiter Christian and received our drinks promptly. Christian let us know that Happy Hour was now being offered on Saturday as well. I ordered one of their signature drinks and my husband Thai iced tea. My drink was soooo good and my husband said his tea was the best he had ever had! We ordered coconut shrimp and summer rolls for appetizers and they came out quickly and were really yummy. For entrees I ordered yellow curry and the hubs got a sauteed veggie and chicken dish. Let me just say, when ordering my curry I asked them to kick up the heat and OMG, it was AWESOME! It was so good I have been thinking and obsessing about getting back to Charm to have it again. The ingredients of all the dishes were fresh and lovely. The presentation above and beyond. Service a ten! This is my new favorite place for Thai food."}
{"text":"We had dinner there with some friends.  The service there was outstanding! I have a severe food allergy and the staff was very aware and made the dining experience a pleasure and I had no worries in regards to my allergy! The food was amazing and we will let everyone know that this is the place to go for exceptional food and service!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Love the food and the location. The only problem is deciding between the yellow curry and the basil fri d rice."}
{"text":"This is Thai kicked up a notch. Expect great service, food that is well presented and garnished, and a personal and elegant atmosphere.
Great for a date night, or an impressive place to become a regular.
The family who owns the restaurant runs the restaurant and staffs the restaurant. You're essentially a guest, eating in their home. From speaking to them, most seem to be from an engineering or highly educated technical background, and that attention to detail shows in their product and service.
It's one of the coolest place to know about - get to be a regular before all your friends do!"}
{"text":"5 stars all day. We love charm thai. Great service and amazing food. Yellow curry chicken is amazing. Have had that dish many other places and it never compares. We eat there at least once a week. It's that good."}
{"text":"Excellent time, the food is extremely fresh. Small place that's allows u to actually hear each other talk. So don't hesitate to go and enjoy a evening or lunch. They have almost been there a year   Check them out!!!!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place, especially since they offer a celiac-friendly menu. Our waiter was an inexperienced high school kid who took about 30 mins to bring us water and menus. I ordered a large soup and he brought me a small after we'd been sitting for over an hour and half. The waiter apologized for the mistake and ran back to the kitchen to correct it before I could tell the poor kid not to worry about it, that I did not like their soup anyway (it was extremely sweet for some reason). My boyfriend's entrée wasn't bad. None of the food or service came close to justifying the insanely high prices."}
{"text":"We ate here a few weeks ago and it was surprisingly delicious! The new owners have made the atmosphere more hip and modern!  Meals can be ordered with wild two tone brown rice or jasmine rice. It's great to have that choice. The waitress was also so nice and accommodating to families. Will go back!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of any rice paper rapped spring rolls. I am so happy they have so much more to choose from here! I have never been disappointed in the food or the wine list! A must to in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately our experience here was not favorable, although there was not many customers, service lacked a sense of urgency and the 3 meals we purchased were mediocre and overpriced. Likely not a place we will return to."}
{"text":"Sweet Birthday Cuisine for Our Sweet 24 yr old Princessa Joelle Thank You Charm Thai.  
Love our Thai tea"}
{"text":"Just moved from Minnesota last July and have been missing the good Red curry from my favorite in MN. This is really good and is my new favorite, also got a free Thai Tea just for checking in which I would anyway. Free soup, quick service, and great environment, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely charming. Lunch specials or happy hour is a must. Drinks are delicious and overall presentation of their dishes is flawless! Very cool, swanky atmosphere. Have not found good Thai food in Chandler until now. Everything I ate was a win."}
{"text":"Been there couple of times for lunch.  Good selection for lunch menu.  Ordered green curry and it was tasty.  The atmosphere is good, but service was a little slow.  It's right in Chandler downtown, sometimes it's hard to find parking"}
{"text":"We love this place! It has a cute little atmosphere and the servers are amazing! I have had that curry soup and that pad Thai which are both delicious! Everything seems to be made with the finest ingredients and to your liking..."}
{"text":"Delicious & affordable. And the staff were very pleasant. Awesome quaint downtown restaurant. Family friendly as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here for lunch randomly as we were walking around Chandler. Not a \"lunch\" spot necessarily as it seems to be much more geared toward intimate dinners. A bit cramped as far as space goes, but overall excellent Thai food and good pricing. We will be going back"}
{"text":"The broth soup is the perfect starter dish. My daughters love it! She asked for more soup. We shared the panang curry with chicken. Yum yum."}
{"text":"I love this  place. I get take out here all the time. The service is really good and the food is obviously good too. They have spicy levels 1 through 5 and for once I actually think that they are pretty accurate for how spicy the food actually turns out. They'll also do steam tofu but you have to ask for it. Overall I would recommend it it's good for a date night."}
{"text":"I had dinner here on a Friday night around 5:30pm. I was seated right away and everything from the drinks, appetizers and entrees were AWESOME! The happy hour prices are good and the overall menu prices are fair. I would highly recommend giving this place a try if you like Thai food."}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant with good service. We have been there twice now and I've liked my food both times. I've had the lemon grass soup and the ginger vegetables. Both had a ample serving size and food was fresh. Reasonably priced and we love to sit outside with the downtown Chandler vibe. Especially now that the weather is cooling off! You won't be disappointed by eating here."}
{"text":"Stopped into Charm Thai for dinner, had the coconut shrimp as an appetizer and it was amazing! Probably the best coconut shrimp I have ever had, not to bready and cooked perfectly. We also each had a rice dish with chicken, ordered it 'medium heat' and was still pretty warm but very tasty! Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to stop in for some curry on our way back to Tucson the other night because I was desperately craving some Kang Karee. We showed up about an hour before close and were the only patrons at the time. The atmosphere is modern and clean.

Our server was very nice and helpful and also attentive. He also gave us space when we needed it during our meal. Really impeccable in that way. We ordered Thai Iced teas which I found to be just right for my taste, my wife would have preferred hers to be a little less sweet.

For our meals, I of course went with the yellow curry with chicken since that was what I was craving in the first place. My wife on the waiters recommendation went with the red curry with duck which was a special. It had cherry tomatoes, red pepper, lychee, pineapple, and basil. She went kinda back and forth on it liking it, then not so much. I thought the duck was cooked nicely but she thought it was too fatty. I thought my yellow curry was honestly very good, but it wasn't the best Ive ever had either. 

Altogether, there's really nothing wrong with this place, and the food is good. It's very good in fact. We're spoiled, though with Sa-ing Thai food in Vail which is more of the little old Thai lady cooking in the back with magic kinda place. We're starting to realize that we just tend to like the more hole-in-the-wall Thai places as opposed to the more upscale. This place is more upscale. Not that there's anything wrong with it, it just doesn't quite do it for me. I would, however absolutely recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Love,love,love their lettuce wraps great spice to them I will say some of the best I have ever had. You will not be disappointed.the Tom yum soup is amazing too. I love both of these so much that I can't break free to order anything else. Great date night place lunch or dinner it's a small intimate place with a little bit of seating outside also."}
{"text":"One of our favorite lunch spots.  Split the chicken wraps (although this time they were a overly juicy).  Vegetable panang curry - hot - with brown rice is a perfect serving size with the right amount of heat.  They have added a bar area that makes smart use of the space.  Glad to see them succeed in an evolving DC."}
{"text":"Ordered for takeout last night through Yelp. Very easy to order and pay. The Summer spring Rolls were excellent! Fresh tasting rolls and the peanut sauce was wonderful! I ordered the pad Thai. I do not like spicy so I ordered it mildly spicy. Came out exactly how I wanted it."}
{"text":"1 star because the food was edible and didn't make us sick. Also...it's the lowest rating possible. :/

minus 4 because the flavor was bad and it was waaaaaaay overpriced. 

I LOVE LOVE LOVE Thai noodles. I travel a lot and always hit up the Thai noodle joints around the hotels. I've had them at some places where the flavor is so amazing that I get absolutely addicted. So when a coworker told me that he got great Thai food right around the corner from my neighborhood, I was excited. I finally got around to ordering from Charm Thai Cuisine a couple of days ago. It was sooooooo disappointing. 

The guy who took my order over the phone was nice enough. I believe he was also the person who gave me my food when I picked it up.

When I called to order, I said that I didn't see pork fried rice as an option for my boyfriend's fave, fried rice. The kid told me he thinks they can do pork fried rice for us. Oh, awesome! Yeeeeah...so \"pork fried rice\" to me, means fried rice with little bits of delicious pork cooked in with it. No...this was an additional $4 (So $15 for fried rice) and turned out to be squishy rice, flavored kind of like fried rice, with a big grilled piece of pork chopped into about 4 pieces, and plopped on top...did I mention it was $4? Ugh. It would've been nice for the guy to have mentioned that it would be $4 extra for pork. 

The noodles were bland, and although I ordered \"Thai hot\" they weren't even very spicy. Most drunken noodles (Pad Kee Mow) I've had were very flavorful and saucy...these were dry, bland, clumped together and I threw 80% of them out. I just couldn't eat them. :(

We paid over $30 for crappy fried rice and gross noodles that went into the trash. 

One more thing...the parking situation is pretty terrible. There's no parking lot for the restaurant. You just parallel park in one of the 4 or 5 spots nearby, or drive around the block and into a pothole filled dirt lot nearby and walk over. Not great for ordering carry out even if for some reason you like the food here.

Needless to say, we won't be returning to Charm Thai."}
{"text":"So, being a fan of a Thai food, my experience here fell way short of any expectations I may have had. The Summer Rolls, listed as gluten free on the menu are served with sauce that is not (we are glad we asked). The owners don't appear to understand the importance behind this mark on their menu. Aside from that, the lettuce and other ingredients were warm, not chilled as is customary. Stay away from the \"crisp\" calamari also. These came out soggy and inedible. Obviously a cheap frozen product. Last, the Thai lettuce wraps were served floating in cold brown water. Weird. Needless to say, there are far better places to eat good Thai food. They could have just been having a bad night, but we won't risk eating there again. Shame. They did, however remove the calamari from the check, which I appreciated."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai I have had in the Valley! Sooo good. Great Happy Hour from 5-7 with premium beer and wine. The yellow curry was rich and flavorful, I opted for medium heat which was perfect for me. My husband had the Thai basil chicken and coconut prawns, both were outstanding. I cannot wait to go back, service was prompt and attentive. Our waitress made great recommendations. I think this is a wonderful addition to Downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"This food was not really for me. I came in for a pick up order and there was a few people ahead of me waiting on to-go orders but there was definitely some chaos and confusion on where to go and where to stand just to talk to talk to a waiter. I ordered the pad thai with beef with level 4 hotness. The dish was more sweet than spicy and I had to put it a ton of sriracha at home just to tame the sweetness level of the sauce. I got no utensils no napkins no soy sauce no slice of lime you'd usually find on the side at \"other\" thai restaurants. I'm comfortable saying tonight was my first and last time here."}
{"text":"Very tasty. Ordered chicken yellow curry to-go. Food delivered promptly when I arrived. Heat levels range from 1-5. I got four. 4 usually destroys me at Thai places. Based on this 4 I think I will go 5 next time and really turn up the heat. Food had great flavor and seemed very fresh. Will come back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Crab Fried Rice, and it was good but it was a little pricey for how much they gave me.  This place was OK.  Eh."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the food is bland. I'm a vegetarian so I always taste for flavor. If a Thai restaurant cannot bring flavor to vegetables then it's not worth it.  Just because they add red chilies to make it spicier doesn't mean it has flavor - now all three of my dishes taste the same - red chilies.

I took my order back to my hotel. The hotel doesn't have utensils in the rooms, and neither did my to go order (I guess the Charm is to use my hands?!)

I should have waited for my order to arrive and verified it BEFORE I paid my bill.  
Welcome to the CURSED Thai Restaurant."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Elvis Presley - Good Luck Charm)

I want a 5 star restaurant
I want some old Thai food
Want your food cause I just can't miss
With a place called Charm like you

Come on and join me a little bite at Charm
Uh-huh huh, you spicy delight
I want a place like Charm
a-hungry man like me
To have, to have, to try, to try tonight


Charm is in the prime real estate in the heart of downtown Chandler.  I love coming down to this part of the town during the weekends, and rather prefer it over Scottsdale.

I came to Charm for a quick bite with a buddy of mines.  The place is still the same from the original Thai restaurant from what I remembered; modern furnishings with traditional Thai decors.  

They start you off with serving a vegetable broth here which I didn't really care for.  I thought it was tad bit too salty but my buddy drank all of his and mines!  I ordered the Drunken Noodles for my entree while my buddy shot for the traditional Pad Thai.  Overall, my noodles were good, but I wish they used more of the glass noodles which I'm accustomed to, but instead I got the large flat noodles like Pad See Ew.  The noodles were still good and I did order a medium spice; but boy did it kick my in the booty.  I guess my weak ass should have ordered mild haha!  I had a taste of my buddies Pad Thai and it was pretty solid and not spiced as he ordered haha!

In the end, Charm is a delight and welcoming atmosphere.  My expectations can be high at times, but Charm will do just fine for a quick bite and drink! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was surprised by how good our meal was here.  My Thai standards are very high after living in Portland, Or.  We enjoyed the green curry, shrimp fried rice, and lettuce wraps.  Everything was really good.  I generally like things quite spicy and have found that Thai hot is hotter than American hot.  I ordered medium spicy and everything was very spicy.  Keep that in mind as you order."}
{"text":"Pretty good... but more expensive than other options in town.  Spice level was great.  Pad Thai was really good.  The staff was also really nice, but would treat this as more of a dine-in than take out joint due to location and cost."}
{"text":"My fav place to eat Thai Cuisine. Coconut Shrimp is fantastic . Crispy calamari is delish! Of course the service is hospitable and welcoming. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my fisrt time here. Service could be faster, but we really enjoyed dinner. The pumpkin appetizer was yummy and gluten free! The pineapple fried rice was also very good."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is really good and they are fast during lunch time which is pretty  surprising for Thai food, which I think is usually slow food. I'm giving 4 stars because they always err on the side of being not spicy enough but then sometimes I'll g wet the hot and it's to hot! They are inconsistent on this one thing so I just order medium now and ask for Sriracha to adjust in my own."}
{"text":"Delicious! Kambucha appetizer, tom yum soup and salmon panang curry were all amazing! Absolutely delicious! Just a tip for the restaurant: ask the customer if they would like their food coursed out. We would have preferred each dish one after the other. Rather the Kambucha and soup came at the same time. A few minutes later the salmon entree came. It would have been better if these dishes were spaced out. Also it took them about 30 minutes to take our order."}
{"text":"After going here 5 or 6 times with different groups it has been a hit every time. I believe this is the best Thai food in the east valley."}
{"text":"Love this place, the atmosphere is really eclectic and relaxing. The food selection is great for any dietary constrictions from gluten free, to paleo, to parasitic cleanse (my friend). 
Christian has been my waiter two times and he is great, and very tentative. I ordered the pumpkin curry with tofu and scallops so good, medium heat was pretty hot (FYI)
The coconut shrimp and coconut wraps were sweet and savory a must try! 
My friend ordered the lemon grass soup and sticky rice and said it was amazing. 
Definitely coming back and enjoying the delectable delights!"}
{"text":"We always drive/walk through this restaurant but never really have a chance to try this it out. Until yesterday, I feel really want to have Thai food as dinner and this charm thai cuisine came to my mind. We arrived this Thai restaurant at around 7:15p.m. but there were only 2 tables having customers. It made me worry about the food quality and taste. However, curry and pad see ew we ordered are BOTH good and we got a free drink(Thai Tea) because we checked in on yelp. Thai tea is a little on sweet side but acceptable and actually tastes good. 

Besides, the restaurant is clean and the service is good. A new hired gay is really helpful on deciding the food and very polite. It was a really great experience to have dinner there."}
{"text":"Moved from Washington to Arizona searched all around for good Thai food 
Stumbled across this place and now I'm hooked 
Great spices and great food"}
{"text":"Walked in because of the lunch special. The food itself was just okay, the purple eggplant stir fry dish was definitely overly salty."}
{"text":"Charm, The name suits the restaurant perfectly! After leaving The Perch due it's extremely rude staff, my parents and I moseyed on over to Charm. A woman greeted us warmly, the server answered all of our questions about the menu patiently with a smile on his face. The lettuce wrap appetizers were a perfect mix of tangy & zesty. The green curry the perfect consistency with a superb flavor. My only with is that the curry was spicier, I didn't specify so that's my own fault. The food arrived promptly and our waters were always full. Thank you Charm Thai Cuisine, you saved our night! I strongly recommend dinning here!"}
{"text":"Excellent Penaang Chicken.  They cater to gluten free and of course can choose the best level of the dish... mine was super tasty and flavorful yet not spicy hot just how I like it.  Whoo hoo. Big serving and so tasty on a chilly day.  Wish I'd have made it over sooner.  Lovely people as well. Nice family owned establishment.  Already made plans to meet s friend for lunch next week.  They do open at noon, so don't be like me showing up at 11:45 lol. Can't wait to try the lemongrass soup."}
{"text":"Super delicious! Great service too! I ordered the pumpkin curry but they brought out the pineapple curry on accident (was a close second choice) I decided to roll with it, I'm not too picky and it was still great, but the waiter brought out a bowl of pumpkin curry for me so I could still try it. SUPER WORTH IT. Really pleasant nice staff. Very timely too!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food. This place was pretty good. It tasted more modern to me then traditional. Decor was also very modern. My go to Thai dish is the chicken pad Thai. I also like it spicy. I tried the number 4 spicy out of 5. Was just the right amount of spice. The speed for the food to come out was longer then expected, but the service was great. All around a pretty good little Thai place for downtown chandler."}
{"text":"Excellent food waiter and waitress very professional.   Amazing food.  The aroma is heavenly."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and each time was a great experience.  First I had the Yellow Curry (level 4 spice) and then I tried the Pad Thai (level 3 spice). Each time I inhaled my food and didn't want to stop when I was full.  

My husband had the Drunken Noodles the first time we went and then the Crab Fried Rice. He loved both of his dishes as well.

I also highly recommend the lettuce wraps!! Sooooo soooo good.

The first time we went our server was a little slow - especially when it came time to bring us our check (why do I hate waiting for my check so much?). But the second time we had someone else who was much more attentive and redeemed the restaurant for us. 

We will definitely go back. It's great food and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Try this place. They have on beatable lunch specials. I am so picky about eating out. I have eaten at the best places in Arizona, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and more. I used to work at a restaurant owned by a chef. I understand the restaurant industry. The owner here is so on top of it and the staff is so reflective of her attitude that even if the food wasn't good I would show up. With that being said, The food is incredible. I've had green curry and pad Thai. I literally woke up in the middle of the night one time dreaming about it. They're so attentive to how you like your food, how spicy you like it, or how spicy you don't like it. I highly recommend trying this place. If you think I'm not picky just check out my other reviews. I tell it  like it is."}
{"text":"Thai food with a Charming twist! The taste will have me coming back and doing the twist as it was pretty remarkable. The dishes have a different style of Thai infusion that works well. Additionally, presentation is phenomenal and makes your eyes feast first and then...attack!

We were a party of 4 and it was great to order a bit of a lot and boy! we ordered  quite a storm! We ate family style with dishes centered where all could serve themselves as needed; Ordering appetizers, main courses, and dessert. At this point I must make reference to the wine selection which is pretty darn good. They also have a full bar ;) tropical drinks and a good beer selection. I chose Singha beer ;)

Please Note*Everything was ordered medium spiciness*

Appetizers- Summer Rolls, full of great fresh veggies, shrimp and a side peanut sauce that was divine, truly a hit! 5
- Bangkok Wings, came out Hot, Crispy, and Spicy, luckily we had a sauce to blow down the heat- very delicious 5
-Papaya Salad, not overly tangy (as some places do) with a good amount of spun papaya, shrimp and peanuts- all I can say is when I looked down to get more, it was gone! Another hit! 5
Main courses- Tom Yum noodle soup, was a miss. It lacked depth and the chicken was somewhat overcooked and crumbly (pic)
Off night on this dish perhaps?
-Drunken noodle w/ seafood, tasty with plenty of seafood but the noodles seemed bit dry; still it was ok. 3.5
-Green Curry w/ grilled pork, another great hit! Of the 3 curry dishes, we all raved over this one! 5 stars...
Yellow Curry w/ chicken, also very delicious with a great curry sauce that made our rice soupy good! 4.5 
Panang Curry w/ beef, lots of tender beef with full flavor, a little different but with a good taste. 4.0
-Dessert was shared but it was suppose to be ALL mine as everyone else said they were way too full. So I ordered the sweet sticky rice with mango- please see photo!
This was AMAZING! Feel free to drool! :)
Everyone took a taste (wish it was a small taste) and in a matter of seconds, it disappeared... magic I suppose. 
Christian and Sean were excellent servers at the ready without being obtrusive. Their great service was the reason behind 4 stars for this place. Good Job!!
Altogether it was a great meal and this is one place we shall return but next time no sharing the dessert; Get your own!
Parking is not an issue as there are several lots within a short walking distance.
Please note the restaurant address shows Boston St. but actually faces Arizona Ave.

Try this place yourself, see what you think

{"text":"Fantastic lunch here that was very fresh and affordable. Pad thai was a bit spicy, so make sure you ask for mild if you can't handle the spice. Nice presentation and quick service. Coconut shrimp was fantastic!!! Pad see ew was my favorite!  They did not skimp on the prawns!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. One of the nicest Thai restaurants - clean & modern on the inside and a nice place to go for a dinner out. They have gluten free marked on the menu. Shared the gf crispy rolls, large tom yum soup and green curry shrimp. Very good."}
{"text":"We live in Chandler so we frequent this establishment every 2 months or so.   Always very fresh food. My husband says it is the best chicken and broccoli dish ever.  I adore the lemongrass soup, though I always ask them to remove the mushrooms and chili.  I can't handle the spicy hot.  I am a veggie so this soup is easily the best thing on the menu for me when I have them add lots of veggies and tofu.   So fresh and wonderful.   The desserts are different but not bad. We tried the fried banana, and the mango with rice and both were unique. 
The place itself is very cute inside and has a nice relaxing quiet vibe.   Good job!"}
{"text":"Good Thai food. I ordered the Thai fried rice with chicken. The dish had a nice flavor and the rice good texture not too sticky nor too dry. 

Good food for a decent price."}
{"text":"Did their yellow curry lunch special and it was excellent. Definitely coming back for a dinner!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place based on its reviews but was quickly disappointed a few minutes after being seated. After 30 minutes, the server finally asked if I would like anything to drink. It was also not very busy. The servers were not too attentive. They forgot my order and were not too apologetic. The food was not that great but the bad service was what made my experience an unpleasant one. I would not be coming back."}
{"text":"We went there during the weekend lunch hour. It was not too crowded. The grilled shrimp was delicious and there were a lot of vegetarian options for my husband. Would definitely go back there."}
{"text":"Went around 7pm on a Saturday. Nice place. Ordered the pad Thai with the flank steak. The portions could be a bit larger. Overall good place though."}
{"text":"Wife and I came here for a Friday night dinner, arriving just before happy hour ended. The deals for happy hour are quite good, $3 beer and $4 wine plus a handful of starters at the $5 mark. 

The place wasn't full at all and the service was somewhat slow but acceptable as it wasn't bothersome either. Our server recommended some dishes one of which I ordered and loved. Something about short ribs and curry made it amazing! 

The atmosphere is nice and open and not too loud. I would come back here again as the food was great!"}
{"text":"Food decent but they offer \"free chai tea\" for checking in, but conveniently for them, they are \"out of tea\"...."}
{"text":"AHHHH- MAZ - ING!!!  Trendy and neat little Thai restaurant on the corner. Very delicious. Flavor combinations, and presentation is ridiculous. Hands down, one of the best Thai places I've ever eaten at. The food tastes so good, you would never know it was Gluten free."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and had the yellow curry with chicken. It was very good!  My friend had the Pad Thai which was also very good!  I brought an order of Pad Thai home for my daughter and for some reason the take home order was not nearly as good-there was no flavor. Perhaps because I told them to make it mild.?   I will definitely go back again for lunch and will also try their dinner! The portions are pretty large as I took home leftovers!"}
{"text":"It's fine, standard Americanized Thai. Bit of a cramped space but overall solid. Thai iced tea is great!"}
{"text":"So happy to have found a Thai spot near home. The ambiance is perfect, so mellow and welcoming. The food is awesome! Christian was our server and he was great. 10/10 would recommend! We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, staff was great, food is very attractive in presentation but lacking in flavor. Our party of six agreed that Pei Wei has better Pad Thai noodles."}
{"text":"Started off my journey looking for a different Thai place, but my shuttle driver was a bit lost, I was hungry, and I saw Charm. Glad I stopped the driver and gave this place a chance. My excellent server had perfect recommendations for drinks, appetizers, and entree. He was spot on. Everything was delicious, perfectly spiced, and quick. I usually avoid places that are in a high tourist area, as it looked like this was, but I'll be back here next time I'm in town.

I had the Miang Khum appetizer, which was excellent, followed by the seafood panang curry, and washed down with a cocktail and a beer.

 Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went to Charm last night based on a recommendation from a friend and we had a great time. It is in downtown Chandler and the restaurant is quite small in the inside but it wasn't too busy on a quiet rainy night. It was the perfect atmosphere.

Our waiter was very nice and gave our group of three girls plenty of time to catch up and talk and laugh and look over the menu. We decided to start with the calamari and coconut shrimp which were both delicious. I am not usually a coconut shrimp fan because I usually find it to be too sweet, but this was perfect. Just the right amount of sweet and savory. The calamari was battered just right and the perfect consistency, I also enjoyed the sriacha cream sauce it was served with.

For dinner I decided on the ribeye thai basil, cooked medium rare. It was delicious! I had it prepared with hot seasoning which definitely crept on me over time but it was not overpowering or too spicy. I would recommend going with medium heat if you are not as big of fan of spicy. The white rice that it was served with was great and soaked up all of the spices. My friends had the crab fried rice and the seafood pad thai. The crab fried rice was out of this world! It was probably the best fried rice I have ever had (aside from the fried rice that my Cambodian friend makes but that's another story). It was tender and served with jumbo lump crab meat on the top, it tasted buttery and melted in your mouth. Yum!! The seafood pad thai was not really something I would order but it was still very good. My friend loved it. It was very unique because not very many restaurants put a variety of seafood in pad thai. It included clams, scallops, tilapia and a few other seafood items. 

At the end of the night my friends and I asked for a picture and our waiter was really nice and took a couple of great pictures of us lively ladies lol. He was a good sport.

Overall it was a great night. I would highly recommend Charm Thai for a unique and delicious Thai experience in Chandler."}
{"text":"After our favorite Thai restaurant in Chandler closed down, we were forced to drive quite a long way to get to another favorite. Now, with Charm Thai in downtown Chandler, we have another favorite close to home.

We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon, so it was pretty quiet there with only a couple of other tables being served.

We had the green curry with tofu and veggies and the Thai fried rice with chicken. Both dishes were excellent! Portion sizes were generous as well, so we had enough for a light dinner later.

The service was excellent as well, so it made the whole experience superb!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in Chandler. Their pad Thai is excellent, along with their coconut shrimp appetizer.  We ordered pad Thai and pineapple curry with jumbo prawns and both were very very good. Portion size is generous as well. 

I'd recommend going during happy hour 5-7 every day. Beers are $3 and appetizers are $5. Be aware that if you order your dish spicy, that it will actually be spicy. I really like spicy food so this is right up my alley. We will definitely be coming back to Charm Thai."}
{"text":"Great place! Recommend the chicken satay and calamari for appetizers and pineapple curry with prawns for an entree. Thai ice tea good but needs a little more \"tea\" flavor. Nice location (right in downtown Chandler) and ambiance. Do eat here and enjoy!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. They are awesome at catering to vegetarians and are always friendly. The food comes quickly which is awesome when you're in a hurry for lunch. The green curry and pumpkin curry are our favs."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to Charm twice. Both times, the food was excellent.  My wife had pad thai, I had chicken panang and my kids ordered appetizers. The restaurant itself is very nice and modern.  We had the same waiter both times - Christian. Christian was extremely friendly and  knew the menu well.  

I've been to quite a few Thai restaurants in Phoenix, Charm is definitely one of my favorites.  Looking forward to going back to try the braised short ribs."}
{"text":"This place knocks it out of the park!!

I was there once back when it was latitudes and it was good, just very pricey. They now have a lunch menu with choices starting at 8 bucks going up to about 10
We had 2 dishes: Grilled prawns and yellow curry

Grilled prawns: wouldn't quite call them prawn but rather large shrimp. They were excellent! Perfectly cooked and actually grilled on a skewer with a sweet'ish glaze

Yellow curry - medium heat...one of the best tasting curries I have had in a while. The heat level for medium was perfect...what medium should be (hot)

Some of the severs are new and not familiar with the menu and this the reason for the 4 stars...train servers!!...they should have eaten everything on the menu at least one and know everything there is to know about a dish.

Bottom line is; great food, great atmosphere (hip modern (not streets of Thailand look like most)) great lunch prices!!"}
{"text":"Good Thai food located in the middle of the bustling Chandler downtown .
Service is friendly 
Tried the pumpkin curry which turned out to be pretty decent."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Ordered take out, Thai fried rice with tofu and pineapple fried rice with chicken. 

The part that I'm confused/irritated about is that I don't see an up-charge for adding protein under their dinner menu. Nor did the email that I received confirming my online order total up-charge me for protein. So why was I charged for protein? If this is what they charge, they should update their menu because it's misleading."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here a couple of weeks ago on our way home from Wickenburg, and we were both feeling Thai food.  Yelp lead us here, and after driving around the block a couple of times trying to find it (it's really not that hard to find.  I don't know why it took us so long), we came in and ate.

I got the red duck curry and the husband got the yellow chicken curry.  What I think is funny, is that he liked the meal way more than I did, I was not a very big fan, and we both, independently, gave it three stars.

I would just like to have it noted that I LOVE duck!  It is my favorite of all the birds.  This duck was alright.  It was served with lychee, pineapple...lots of sweet stuff.  My husband thought this was a delight, while I thought it was just too sweet.  The chicken curry was fine, nothing special, but not hideous.  There was not a ton of spice and flavor, so maybe for someone who is a first time curry-er this would be good?

We came up with this: we are just spoiled by a couple of Thai places in Tucson that knock food out of the park, where there is a Thai nana in the back whipping up recipes from her childhood to serve in their hole in the wall restaurant.  We enjoy these places a bit more than the fancier, cloth napkin, candles on the table places."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! I get the yellow curry with vegetables only and it's so yummy. The Thai tea is really good. The value is awesome. Nice amount of food for not too high of a price. I'm really addicted to this place. Wish they were open on Sundays!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Charm! The food is high-quality and delicious and there is always enough for two meals. We have enjoyed the indoor and outdoor seating as well as delivery. I highly recommend Charm Thai Cuisine."}
{"text":"Ordered take out, but the spicy eggplant garlic and drunken noodles. Both were good and tasty, the order was quick and ready when I arrived."}
{"text":"I grabbed some yellow mild curry with jasmine rice and thai tea. The food was great, will definitely be coming back! The Thai tea is awesome!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were out for date night on a lovely Friday evening in downtown Chandler.
We both spotted Charm Thai Cuisine at the same time while strolling around looking for someplace cozy and upscale to have dinner.
We both love Thai food and neither of us had dined here before so we decided to give it a try.

We started by sharing the Crispy Kabocha Pumpkin appetizer followed by Lettuce Wraps and Panang Curry with Salmon.
The portion sizes were perfectly appropriate for this style of dining and were plenty for the two of us.
I've dined at other Bistro style Thai restaurants and this was by far the best experience I've had.
Every dish was delicious with the right amount of sweetness and spice.
The delightful pumpkin appetizer was tender, slightly sweet, with a light crunchy coating and quite satisfying.
The filling for the lettuce wraps was fresh and very tasty.
For us the salmon was perfectly cooked and the curry was yummy with good depth of flavor and it complimented the fish nicely.
My girlfriend was was especially pleased with the delicate preparation and the visual appeal of how the dishes were plated.

The service was prompt and courteous, the prices were very reasonable for this setting, nice atmosphere, and the perfect spot for a weekend dinner date.

{"text":"Hidden secret on the menu is their Thai Coffee! It's amazing!! So refreshing and just the right amount of Sweet vs. Caffeine. In fact, it's almost like being in Thailand again!!!! #ThaiCoffee it's better than #ThaiTea and Charm is the ONLY place in a 30 mile radius that serves it!!! Get the coffee, it's nice"}
{"text":"Tried Charm Thai for the first time tonight.  Haven't had much good thai food for a while as we have just moved here from Los Angeles where good Thai food is abundant. Enjoyed the food very much. Tried the pad Thai, duck curry and coconut shrimp. All were excellent.  Will make this our new \"go to\" place for Thai food.  Very good."}
{"text":"I wish I could give negative stars. I tried to place an order thru grubhub. I ordered my food at 9:15 pm I didn't get a message until almost 10pm that they canceled my order. Charm told me it was because they sent their kitchen staff home. Grubhub said it was because charm was too busy. They're both lying and won't accept responsibility for this huge mistake. It's passed 10pm I have family in town and no dinner. Tim who I spoke with on the phone was a joke. Said I have no business threatening a bad review. Even tho he was rude and clearly could not care about customer service at all. He argued with me for over 10 min. The worst case of deflecting Ive ever experienced with a restaurant. I will never ever eat at this place again. Horrible horrible customer service"}
{"text":"Great little find in downtown Chandler! Have not made it for happy hour yet, but definitely plan on doing so!

The Goods: 

*THE FOOD! OMG, THE FOOD! Quality ingredients and authentic flavors. Many gluten free choices. Howevwr, if you suffer from Celiac disease, do not order the fried items noted GF as they're fried in the same oil as non-GF items. We have tried several items. My favorite being the summer rolls, Thai lettuce wraps (not your basic wraps. They do pack a little kick and a phenomenal citrus flavor. Think Mariscos mixed with PF Changs and then taken up a couple levels in awesomeness), and the Massamun curry (those short ribs are AHH-mazing, and the curry sauce...my mouth is watering just thinking about it). And I LOVE that they custom spice your food! \"How hot do you want it?\" Oh, VERY hot, young man!   

*Nice but casual ambience. I wore a nice dress for dinner because we were going out afterwards and I did not feel overdressed. However, I've also been here before with jeans and sandals and was equally comfortable.

*Friendly, unpretentious service. Waiters are very nice and genuinely helpful.


The Bads:

*Chill, maybe too chill service. While very nice service, do NOT come in if you're trying to eat and run. They do sometimes take a little long bringing you drinks or taking your order. But if you're in good company and not starving to death, the time passes quickly. Oh, and fair warning, if you order something spicy, do ask the waiter for extra water because waiting for them to refill your glass while your mouth is on fire may not be too attractive if you're on a hot date! Once, they fine tune the attentiveness of they're wait staff, this will definitely be a 5-star type of place!

Tip: Stop in for an after dinner cup of joe next door at Peixoto. Sometimes they have live music on weekends. Their cascara tea (cold or hot) is good too!"}
{"text":"So we were looking for something different to eat, and we stumbled into this restaurant! Nice atmosphere and the staff was super friendly. Service was good and for the most important part, the food was delicious. We had a curry beef plate, and for dessert we fried banana ice cream! The presentation of the plates were amazing as if we were in a 5star restaurant. My wife Laura Mercado took the photos. Definitely will recommend and be back!"}
{"text":"The interior here is quite charming and they have reasonably priced lunch specials. I had Charm Thai bookmarked for quite some time. I actually tried to come here a year or so ago but we couldn't find the restaurant (Hint, it's around the corner from Boston St. and next to Peixoto). Since we were at Peixoto for coffee, we figured let's try Charm for lunch afterwards!

The menu offers several dishes and Thai favorites for around $8. I decided on the eggplant garlic with tofu and tried some of the Bangkok wings. They both came out in a short amount of time. The eggplant garlic had other veggies such as bamboo shoots and green beans, with a small vegetable spring roll and mound of rice. It was decent, and everything on the plate wasn't overly remarkable but it was a good amount of food for $8. The sauce was a bit of a generic tasting \"Asian\" brown concoction. It was so generic that my husband thought the leftovers I took home was quickie take-out Chinese food when he ate it lol. I had requested it medium spicy and I thought they delivered well on that end. It had enough spice to assert itself in the meal but wasn't an overpowering amount of heat.

The Bangkok wings had a delectable crispy crunchy coating and tasted really similar spice-wise to Buffalo wings to me. It's a pretty potent amount of spice and saltiness though so I probably wouldn't be able to eat a whole plate of them.

Service was friendly and we had no problem splitting the check for our meals. 

Since there are other delicious places to eat in downtown Chandler, I'm glad I tried Charm Thai but I'd probably only eat here again if I was in the area anyways and really craving Thai food."}
{"text":"Amazing Chicken Red Curry!!!!! First time here and was very pleased with the food and service. Definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My friend and I had our first visit today (lunch), and it will be our last.  When we arrived, we were quickly greeted, seated and brought a hot cup of vegetable broth - very tasty - by a friendly smiling young woman.
But then it went south.  Our server - another young woman - was neither friendly nor smiling.  My friend ordered eggplant stir fry and it arrived hot and steaming, loaded with vegetables, certainly worth the $8.  However, my order of grilled chicken and vegetables ($9) looked like most of it was missing: 5 pieces of equal size (3\" x 1/2\") chicken with identical grill marks (you know the kind; pre-cooked and you just heat them), 6 small pieces of assorted veggies, a tiny spring roll and a large ball of white rice.  Nothing hot, nothing steaming. When the server finally came out of the kitchen, and I got her attention, and told her nothing on my plate was even warm, let alone hot, she sighed, looked down at me and asked if I wanted anything else.  Her expression was one of total indifference; she did not even offer an apology!  I replied that I would have what my friend ordered, and she sighed again (as if doing her JOB was boring her) and walked back to the kitchen. When the new dish arrived (in an amazingly short amount of time!) it was hot, and steaming and the flavor was good.  Based on this experience, I am inclined to think that most of their food is pre-cooked and just heated.  Better to patronize a Thai restaurant that actually prepares and cooks your food to order, and also understands customer service.  How hard is it to apologize? 
Even I can do it: Sorry, there are no photos. I rarely write reviews (I have only written 2 before - both positive) and I was not intending to write one today, but after thinking about it for an hour, I felt compelled."}
{"text":"I went there today and tried Drunken Noodles - the taste was good, but it was luke warm and some parts were cold. It looked like it was not freshly cooked and just microwaved. The spices were really good, but I expected better food for $12 also quantity is not enough for a meal."}
{"text":"We haven't been back since the past review I did. We had a craving for Thai and wanted to stay local so back we were. This time sadly to say the food has lost its charm a bit and yes we experienced the one women show with waiting for our order to be taken, drinks to be served, and there was only 2 tables filled one with a single diner, the other a party of 2 just finishing up. There seem to be take out orders that were taking presidence as we just sat and waited.

We had the lunch specials of Pad Thai, Panang Curry and an order of Tom Kha (coconut soup). The owner seem to be pushing the chicken for every dish, have no idea why. The soup was good, but hardly any chicken, the Pad Thai was good but there was hardly any chicken and 1 shrimp. The Panang Curry was tasteless, again hardly any chicken, a lot of beans and red peppers.

I'm sorry to say thai restaurant competition is high, take note."}
{"text":"So delicious! Lots of options for meat eaters and vegetarians! They mixed up my order but quickly fixed it and it was very good. I had the kabocha pumpkin curry with tofu and my husband got the Tom Kha soup (it was a big portion and good for an entree) service was friendly and pleasant."}
{"text":"Very  nice little Thai eatery in the heart of downtown Chandler.  Public parking is easy as irs right met to the building.  Ample options on the menu.  Most important, it's overpowering with music or the strong spices smell.  We enjoyed it, Christian the waiter was a great waiter."}
{"text":"When this reataurant first opened I got every meal I expected from restaurant that wanted to survive. Fresh, flavorful...correct. Recently it almosts seems like it could be different ownership. Quality and quantity has changed for the worse. Ive eaten both in house and taken out since this place has opened. Not only did I get the wrong order entirely tonight, but the pad thai chicken i got was bothing but overly sauced soggy noodle and sparce pieces of chicken. In my opinion it is way overpriced for the quality/shot in the dark."}
{"text":"Amazing food and reasonably priced! My teenagers love it too!  The restaurant is small but cozy and very charming"}
{"text":"Wen there on a mother-daughter date. Food was amazing. Service was good. Just wish they didn't share a bathroom with the bar. That was a little weird."}
{"text":"I wanted to treat my mom on mother's day, I had the roasted duck red curry and my mom had the pineapple fried rice , there must have been something wrong with the place that day because the food was inedible... We wanted to return the food and so did some other folks at other tables. I love Thai food but that was such a disappointment."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Chandler. Every single time I'm there each good experience is even better than the last one. All the dishes are so light, fresh & flavorful. The atmosphere and ambiance is very simple & relaxed. All the staff members are very kind."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and great! The location is clean and in a fun area. Perfect for a date night or ladies night out.

Food was great! We got the free Thai Tea which was delicious. Also had red curry and  drunken noodles. We got to choose our protein and spicyness level. Waitress was great and attentive.

Please note that they respectfully decline substitutions and changes. I would suggest this place for vegetarians/vegans as, even with the changes stipulation, you can still have a great meal. However anyone who dislikes certain vegetables will have a harder time. 

I still think this place deserves a 4/5. I was not blown away, but it is still a very good restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food! We come
here quite often. The food is incredible! He only reason have it four stars is because the front of the house staff are not as attentive to their tables as they should be. We have had to flag down a waitress before to get drinks and to take our order. Not all the front staff are inattentive they do have some great servers up front such as Christian. He is awesome and very good. We ask him to surprise us with food and he comes through every time. My fiancé and I will continue to come to this restaurant. You must try the coconut shrimp!!"}
{"text":"The service has gotten much worse than the last time I was here. We waited forever for our drink and food order. It was like they only had one waitress serving 6 tables. Love your food but you really need to improve your customer service. We got no apologies either."}
{"text":"The food took an eternity to arrive. There were 4 tables, myself included, and it took an hour to bring out 4 dishes to our table. 

The food is pretty good, but don't come here if you don't have 2 hours."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed with this place. The Panang Curry w/ Salmon is just delightful!  Today I went for lunch with a friend. We were pleasantly surprised with their lunch specials and all they include. I had the Basil Chicken, and it came with a vegetable broth and mini-eggroll (see pic). Portion sizes are just right, and so are the prices. Quaint atmosphere, friendly & prompt service, and fantastic location. Every person I've brought says he/she is definitely going to return. I know I'll keep returning"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Charm.  The food was excellent.  The presentation was beautiful.  The staff were friendly, knowledgeable of the menu. and professional.  I hope it stays this way."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great happy hour menu (drinks and food from 5-7pm), good food, and our server Tim was top notch. The calamari and summer rolls were a a tasty appetizer for my wife and I.  I had the chicken in green curry and my wife had the panang salmon.  The chicken was great and the salmon was alright.  Definitely be back for an overall satisfying experience."}
{"text":"Really good pumpkin curry! When they say mild, they mean American-palate mild. The pumpkin was a bit dry and needed more curry broth, but the taste of the plate was amazing! Nice atmosphere, prices medium to high, which is typical for this type of \"Thai classy\" restaurant, and very reasonable for the downtown district."}
{"text":"The curry here is absolutely delicious and the appetizers are also yummy. The portions are huge and the atmosphere is really great. It is so nice to have a good Thai place right in downtown Chandler where there is lots to do. The cocktail list is interesting and they have sake and beer to complement the food."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, nice little wine selection plus a full bar and very reasonably priced! Perfect for date night or appetizers and drinks with the girls."}
{"text":"So....I was really looking forward to our lunch here.  We had been to its predecessor Latitude 8 a few times and it was a good spot in one of our favorite parts of Chandler.  After reading the reviews I figured the food would be great and the service would be 'relaxed' ...but good.

Allow me to preface this with the fact that years ago, serving tables and bar-tending was my livelihood, so I am a pretty good judge of when a server is swamped vs when a server that is just not skilled and is drowning...unfortunately we experienced both today.

We were seated almost immediately when we waked in and expected the waiter to bring waters back and take a drink order...or at least come back...when he didn't and after seeing three other tables be seated and have drinks already, I waved him over and asked if we could have some waters w lemon and a beer ,and that we would be ready to order once he returned.  I gave him the benefit of the doubt as it WAS somewhat busy, but not too busy to serve the tables that came in after us...but I digress.  About 15 minutes later he came back with the water....no lemon...no beer, we placed our order and I politely asked him to retrieve the missing items and he said he would.  Another fifteen minutes pass and I stop his counterpart to let him know that perhaps his waiter buddy was too busy and asked if he could get the lemons and beer.  He was quite apologetic and said he would and also asked if we had ordered...I told him maybe we should re-order as the other waiter didn't seem to grasp everything, so we did.  This guy came right back with the lemons and beer, apologized again and said that he would be taking care of us from now on.  Our appetizer emerged about 15 minutes after that...along with my lunch,  carried by the original waiter.  He paused when he saw the look I gave him and asked if he should take my meal back to the kitchen...aggravated at this point, I told him to just leave it.

The food was pretty great!  Everything very fresh and flavorful.  Summer rolls(Fresh rolls) were just ok and I would have expected a little more creativity, but like I said they were fresh and their peanut sauce was pretty good.  I had two other fresh items: Miang Khum (coconuts wraps) and the Lettuce Wraps.  Both had great flavor but very cheap on the meat...the \"prawns\" were finely diced and maybe had a total of two tablespoons for the entire plate and the ground chicken, while seasoned correctly, was quite grisly.  My GFs meal showed up just as we finished sharing the Summer Rolls, she ordered the Paht Si-io (Pad See Ew), a dish she orders at every Thai place we go and unfortunately was not impressed.  She ordered hot and this was barely mild.  Also it was really not seasoned very well at all...and the \"Chinese Broccoli\" was nothing more than run of the mill broccoli florets.  

Our meal ended up getting discounted which was appreciated, and the 'good' server was again apologetic.  However we were left once again waiting 5 mins for someone to take our card to pay.  Overall not the best experience, but perhaps we will visit again in the evening to see if it gets better."}
{"text":"It was a little more of a modern twist on Thai.  Fresh and delicious too, we had the pad Thai and the lettuce wraps. We were at the hospital with our our new born and ordered off Yelp. The food was done quick and when I got there it was hot and ready. The guy that got it for me was happy to help and made sure to ask if I needed chili sauce, which I did. I would go back."}
{"text":"It's a sick joke when you order Thai food to go and request yours to be mild while your boyfriend requests medium spicy but you get home to discover your mild with a smile is actually medium spicy. My mouth was crying.  It was good but I couldn't taste it much due to my chugging of water and pain of the spice.

However, this place has amazing Pad Thai filled with tons of flavor and great portion size. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I try and come like once a week. The food is great. Better service in the evening I think. I come with the lunch crew from work and the Thai women who serve are awesome and teach you how to say the words but there is one guy with the earrings who is always overwhelmed and spilling water. Watch out for him. But the food is delicious. Order the summer rolls."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Charm Thai!  Very nice decor and welcoming atmosphere. Came here for lunch with friends. 

The crispy kabocha pumpkin was delicious. I loved how it was served in a glass with greens. Great presentation. 

I had the tom kha soup medium spiced. Perfect!  

Their lunch specials are only $8. I had the yellow curry with chicken also medium spiced.  It was excellent. 

This is a great little place for lunch or a date night dinner. I can't wait to go back and try more things. There are also a lot of vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Charm Thai Cuisine on a Saturday evening and shared some apps at the bar and took some entrees to go. We were seated right away and it was very quiet and inviting. The staff was very friendly and they had sports games on the TVs. 

We checked in and got a free Thai Tea and we shared the fish cakes and fried veggie rolls, which was delicious! The dishes are smaller, but a great way to enjoy different flavors and not get full by your entrees. 

We asked what the most popular entree dishes were but the waiter/bartender was not familiar with any of the dishes. We asked him his favorite and he couldn't speak to much but recommended the veggie delight. We took his recommendation and ordered the chicken pad see ew and the ginger veggie delight (Spice level \"hot,\" right before \"Thai hot.\" The pad see ew was amazing! We enjoyed it so much we wanted to go back and order it again! Although the pad see ew was great the veggie delight was not as thrilling and would recommend trying something different. 

Overall we enjoyed our experience and think this location may be under appreciated and not get as much credit as it's owed. There is a lot of competition in the downtown chandler area but this would be a place I would definitely check out again!"}
{"text":"So.... I underestimated this restaurant. I thought it would be super americanized and have no heat. I ordered a curry and asked for it to be very spicy..... OMG it was VERY spicy.... Which I appreciated. The curry was fairly tasty and came in a huuuuge plate, but contained not that much in the way of sustainence... Just a little bit of chicken and veg and a fairly small amount of rice as well. For their fairly high prices, I was hoping to get a little more. At least the chicken seemed to be of high quality. Additionally, we ordered their sticky rice dessert with mango because they said it was amazing.... It was.... Not amazing. It was pretty to look at (as was all the food here), but the flavor just didn't compare to other mango sticky rice dishes I've had elsewhere. Anyway, if you're in the area, this place certainly isn't bad and has some nicely presented dishes, just expect the cost to be a bit on the high side."}
{"text":"Came here today for a surprise lunch date for my daughters birthday.
Had the worst service and the food was ok.
Shawn was our server and in a rush to take our order. (Understandable it was busy lunch time rush)
After going over our order twice, because his Ipad tablet thing froze.
I told him I want to order and extra side of white rice and then sticky rice for dessert for my daughters birthday.

When the food came out another server bought out our dishes.  I reminded her about the extra side of white rice we ordered with the entrees.
She brings it out and also brings out sticky rice.
I clarified with her that it is my daughters birthday if we can have that come out last with a candle or something and that i wanted mango sticky rice for dessert.

She said she will see what they have.
2 seconds later Shawn charges out of the kitchen  saying \" just so you know. You said sticky rice not jasmine rice\".
I said im sorry you misunderstood me i meant sticky rice for dessert and a side of white rice with the entrees\"
Then he goes \" then i guess your right\" and charged back into the kitchen.

Totally inappropriate behavior my husband who usually gives people the benefit of the doubt was even shocked and surprised at what just happened.

We didn't even mind that their was a mix up.
We understand things get misunderstood.
However Shawns response and behavior was inappropriate and ruined  a nice birthday lunch for my daughter.

We will not return due to service and food was ok."}
{"text":"I'm constantly using yelp to locate places to try. I love Thai food and have been unsuccessful in finding a place I liked. Charmed was wonderful flavorful & the service was great. I loved this place. Thai tea was awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Was my first time here. Food was really good! I would recommend people here. I do think the food could be a little more spicy but that's the only thing. I love how they dress up the plate they make it very presentable. Can't wait to come back and try something else. The dessert omgggggahhhh  delish! I got the mango with white sticky rice. We will be back try it people!"}
{"text":"Location is terrific, plenty of parking. The store front faces Arizona Ave and is a relatively small interior. The style is fairly modern and sadly there are TV's a plenty.

The food is wonderful. Over the years that Charm has been open they have done a great job of changing and adapting. I love the current iteration and the well priced lunch specials. The curries are tasty but tend to run a little low on the spice scale - on the other hand the non-curry dishes bring the heat very nicely.

The service is quick and efficient. No muss, no fuss. 

The bottom line is that the name Charm Thai is appropriate for this charming little restaurant that offers great food at a good price."}
{"text":"We are tourists here for spring training baseball.  We went to Charm Thai because it was a short walk from our hotel.  It was fabulous!  Some of the best Thai food we have had.  My husband had the Penang Curry with salmon.  It was rich, slightly sweet yet spicy. Wonderful!   I had Massamon Curry with short ribs - delicious!  And coconut- pineapple ice cream for dessert - perfect!  We highly recommend Charm Thai."}
{"text":"Great little place with friendly service. Sit outside near traffic or inside in the intimate setting. There is live music at certain times. I eat a lot of Thai food wherever I go and this is among the best tasting. My baseline is yellow curry chicken and Charm Thai Cuisine has consistent quality whether it's lunch or dinner. 4/5 is hot so be sure you order correctly."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other day on a work lunch. I was incredibly impressed by the cleanliness and style of the place...easily one of the nicest Thai restaurants I've been to. The food was great, service was friendly, and, overall, it was a great place for a work lunch.

I ordered the chicken pad thai for my meal. The portion was perfect (I'm a big eater) and every bite was loaded with flavor and balanced. I've had my fair share of pad thai with too little chicken or too much of something else...this one was great.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, cute place but small portions of okay thai food.  Not worth the price.  Much better Thai food at La's Thai Northsight Scottsdale, AZ."}
{"text":"This was a delicious restaurant that we were invited to on Saturday night. What a find!  The wait staff was efficient, friendly, and helpful. We were trying to get to a show in Gilbert, easy to do. The food was amazing! I ordered the yellow curry with shrimp, it was perfect. We ordered the purple sticky rice and mango...perfect! Would definitely recommend this restaurant. Small, with a great vibe and food!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, atmosphere is good, water and waitresses are cute! I went here at 2:30, almost close, so come here early for lunch. I like Thai curry, soup, Thai tea, and green tea ice cream. I would love to come here again."}
{"text":"Charm has some super solid Thai food! 

I am at Peixoto a ton and much of the time I end up getting hungry so charm is a perfect option right next door! 

The Pad Thai is great and the Satay is pretty good as well! 

It's a good place to get a meal in under an hour and have great conversation with friends!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here with a friend for lunch and was very pleasantly surprised. It feels brand new in here, maybe a change of ownership?? Good service and a lovely lunch selection. You can spice things up as high as you can take it. Everything was delicious and I can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"I thought it was okay. The food was meh.  I had the crispy spring rolls and pad thai noodles. It was my first time eating pad thai noodles and I will not order them again. The spring rolls were not crispy. I waited a long time for my food and was not offered water.  
I won't return."}
