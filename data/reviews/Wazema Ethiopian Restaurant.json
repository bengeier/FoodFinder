{"text":"Came for dinner as a group pf four and had the most delicious dinner-veggie platter for four plus an order of shiro. We ordered gluten free injera as one person in our party is gf. Food was outstanding and service was great. To add to an already perfect night there were four dancers: two male and two female, who performed many excellent dances complete with costume changes. The music was fantastic and the dancers incredible. They brought patrons up onto the stage to dance with them and it was just wonderful. As we were leaving (very reluctantly, but we had an event to attend) we were greeted by a man who I assume was the owner who asked how our dinner and our night was. It was a nice touch and a great ending to a perfect dining experience. We have been here a number of times but this is our first time since the renovation and we are eager to return!"}
{"text":"My mom discovered this place by chance and couldn't wait to take others to taste the goodies. It's an unpretentious food and drinks place for the neighbourhood, very relaxing atmosphere. The menu is nearly all traditional Ethiopian. If you are vegetarian there's a lot to eat. The beef dishes are fabulous. Each one uniquely spiced but not overwhelmingly hot. Didn't get to try the lamb this time. We ordered the Wazema platter which is a sampler of meats and Veg's and a kind of cottage cheese made from buttermilk, all served on injera. There was more injera on the side, both the brown and the white. And it's gluten free. And the fermented flavour is so good. So much food we had to take the rest home. The two young ladies serving were so gracious and accommodating. It's all made fresh so you have to wait once you've ordered, so we drank some of their spiced tea. I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"The food was good and the chicken tibs was quite tasty, but seemed overpriced for what it was compared to other Ethiopian restaurants. Unfortunately, service was very slow considering the restaurant was only half full and servers did not seem very coordinated."}
{"text":"Food was ok.

Service was horrible. People working there were friendly but that is no excuse for horrid service. Even the bill took over 20 minutes. Just couldn't wait to get out of there and even that took long."}
{"text":"Welcome to the world of unbelievable inconsistency in dining experiences. my first visit was on a very busy Friday evening and it was fantastic, last night on a not-as-busy weeknight, our experience was very different. On the Friday, the owner was there, last night she was not, I can only assume this was the difference. 

I came with a couple old friends for dinner. I was raving about how amazing it was. The food retained the tastiness, but the service was really really bad. My SO asked for water twice and never got it. When they did bring water, she put a glass in front of everyone BUT him. His food was served well done when he asked for rare, the meal took 45 min to come out, and other tables that arrived after us were served their food before us over and over and over again. The servers never came to us unless we flagged them down. Really disappointing, and I felt bad for my friends that trekked so far out there. 

I don't know what else to say, I'm a little disheartened. Ethiopian families kept wandering in the entire 2.5 hours we were there, so I guess they don't need Yelp to generate business, I'm just super disappointed."}
{"text":"Very very poor service. 

Restaurant is too dark inside. They do not believe in lighting or at least they don't want to bring attention to the dirty dated dining area. 
We waited 20 mins before the lousy waitress even took our order. At which point she made us feel like we were bothering her. We even saw another patron go behind the bar and serve herself. 
There were only 3 other tables of customers. 
We waited nearly an hour for our food that was awful. The shiro was watery and the doro wat was burnt. Being East African we are very familiar with the food and know what to expect. They took advantage of my young family thinking we didn't know better. 

To top it all of the waitress was rude, inattentive and quite frankly really miserable.

NEVER GOING BACK!"}
{"text":"I loveeee Ethiopian food! Specifically, I love the Wazema platter for 2! It has the veggies basics and 2 meats- tibs which is cubes of beef sautéed in spices; and kefto which is ground beef cooked with spices. We ordered our kefto medium. The platter came with salad in the middle and various vegetables all wonderfully spiced and soooo tasty! 

The price and and size of the platter for 2 was just perfect for the 2 of us. I ordered a mango juice too to compliment one of the spicier veggie dishes. Don't get it twisted though, the platter is not spicy. It just has a wonderful mix of spices that always makes me feel like there's a party in my mouth with each bite! My fiancé always reminds me of how much I love this food when he hears me making groaning noises when eating. He says it sounds like I'm having foodgasms! Lol

I'm finally  writing this review after regularly coming to this place probably every 3 months! If you're adventurous and want to experience what a foodgasm is then try this joint our for sure!"}
{"text":"Hmm let's see 
1) service was 4/5 star - friendly , quick 
2) ambiance - 3 
3) food - 3 
4) price - 3 little higher than what I've seen at other Ethiopian joints in town 
They got what looks like a well stocked bar ... worth checking out."}
{"text":"I went to Wazema with some friends to try Ethiopian food and we were surprised to learn that some things were delicious and others a little bit different. They serve you a type of bread called Injera. The good news is Injera is gluten free. The bad news is, it is a bit on the sour side.  I found I could only eat so much of it. The good news is, it tasted less sour when you place all of the dips and meats onto the Injera.

After eating at the restaurant, my friends and I concluded it would have been a better idea to order a big platter so we could all try everything. We all shared our food but we leaned towards some dishes. 

I ordered the Wazema Platter for one and really enjoyed the Kitfo, split peas, lentil, and mild split peas.

It was really good and I would recommend getting the dish again. 

The weird thing is, we asked to have Ethiopian coffee and our waitress told us you can only have it on a Friday and not on a Saturday as Their kitchen is too small to provide this service. That seemed pretty odd to us because typically Fridays are just as busy as Saturdays. 

Anywho, it was a good experience and I think I could eat Ethiopian again."}
{"text":"My fav Ethiopian restaurant on the Danforth!
Excellent service.
Excellent cultural dance shows.
Excellent food.
Excellent delivery.
No complaints about this place! Try it!! The platter for two is our go to staple."}
{"text":"We have tried quite a few Ethiopian restraints on this strip.... Lalibala (4/10 And very inconsistent), Randevouz (7/10) and I can't remember the rest of the names. We had been here before but my last trip there was after awhile and I just say both my husband I and were shocked that we didn't  back sooner. They were super busy but the food arrived in perfect time and the service was 10/10 and everything was so fresh ! The dulat was the best!! I will never go bak to lalibala again especially the queen st w location ( that's another story!). But wazema is a must!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the fourth Ethiopian restaurant I've tried and this ranks at the top for quality and quantity! The atmosphere of this place is more like a bar/lounge and apparently there is live music in the evening at 10pm, but we simply came here for the food.  Service was decent, but can be more attentive considering it wasn't that busy there. No need for reservations on a Saturday for dinner unless you're planning to be there for the live music.

If you're unsure what to get and there are at least two of you, get the Wazema platter for two, three or four! You get a mix of flavourful meat and veggie dishes plus a salad in the middle.  They give you plenty of injera as well."}
{"text":"I'm trying to understand why so many Ethiopian Restaurants are so red? It's really unexplainable to me - the predominant choice of this particular colour...

So yes - Wazema's interior is extremely...red.

Food wise, it's a decent spot. The food is quite nice, around a 3.5.
The drink list is priced well in terms of value, but they don't actually carry Ethopian beer as the menu states."}
{"text":"They are very generous with the portions, always enough for the next day. Amazing food quality, and friendly service."}
{"text":"Best ethiopian food I have ever had (I used to live in DC and New York -- this tops them both)! My husband and I shared the veggie platter and an order of kitfo. Everything was flavorful and perfectly seasoned. Service was friendly, although communication was limited (I got the sense that not all the wait stuff fully spoke/understood English). On the night we were there, they also had a beautiful cultural performance that showcased dances and music from all over Ethiopia. The place also had great ambiance -- a good date night spot for adventurous eaters. Would definitely go again."}
