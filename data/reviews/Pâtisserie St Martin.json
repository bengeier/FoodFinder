{"text":"My family went to the bakery to get a cake for Father's Day. I asked for a lighter cake, the clerk recommended the short cake with strawberries. It was delicious and light! The store carries seasonal products such as Natas Pastries, Zeppoles, specialties such as grilled hazelnut cake, mimosa cake. I suggest joining their Facebook page for the latest news."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! I usually leave with too much stuff because everything is just amazing and it's impossible to choose. They have a good selection of cold salads and pizzas and bread. I usually get my birthday cake from there and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I love Patisserie St-Martin! They have a large assortment of things you can buy such as freshly baked bread, deli meats, cheeses, pasta, etc. They have a lovely section of pastries for all kinds of events and I'm sure you can order one for your event.

You can get a sandwich made and even eat it outside. Fantastic.

My only qualm is that the staff is unable to smile, throughout the years I have come here, they all collectively looked pissed off. Sometimes they also tend to keep pastries on show that aren't fresh and on 1-2 occasions wasn't very good...."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have it all! Pastries, Cakes, Pizzas, Sandwiches, cold cuts, bread... and its all fresh! You must try the lobster tails. they are purely amazing. The Pizza is to die for! You got to try the \"Arugula Pizza\" its no where close to bitter.

Ask them about the catering service, you won't believe what they have on the menu. It is all to die for. Don't forget if you need a quick lunch, you can come here and they will make you a sandwich or a hot meal.

I am here quite often, just to get Pizza. Forget about Pizza Hut. This pizza is fresh and its really good."}

La boulangerie, patisserie, traiteur et l'endroit pour des repas express par excellence à Laval.  Tout est frais, tout est bon!  À essayer:  leur Canolis frais avec de la ricotta!

The best place for fresh bread, deserts, express meals or for catering.  Everything is fresh and delicious.  Must try:  their Canolis with ricotta!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this bakery besides I'LL TAKE ONE OF EACH. It's really how this place makes you feel! You want it all because it's already prepared and it smells so good! Pizza, breads, pastries, desserts... All top notch.

I've been coming here for years and it's one of Laval's best offerings.

During the holidays, I had to pick up some desserts for various family dinners, and instead of getting pricier pastries for such a large group, I decided to get some lemon cookies and biscottis instead. These guys are sold by the weight so I thought about 2 dozen of each should suffice for the amount of people and still be pretty affordable. I was wrong on the affordable part. 18 biscotti and 24 lemon puff cookies cost approx. $60. Was I taken aback? Sure. Angry? A little. But gosh darn - they were the best F'n lemon glazed puff cookies I've ever had. They were like little sweet clouds of heaven that had to have been freshly baked and glazed. 

So there you have it. Sure, certain items can be pricey but it's worth it."}
{"text":"ah une bonne pâtisserie boulangerie proche de chez soi j adore leur gâteau le pain et leur pizza froide hummmm ,les prix un peu élevée mais je dois dire le choix est la très occupé preuve que cest bon oui je le recommande mais je dois dire que le sourire manque un peu du personnel je sais pas pourquoi oh moins ça ne reflète pas la qualité des produit"}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for over 20 years. They make the most incredible cakes. Whatever design you bring them, they will conquer.
Memorable: diet pepsi can, ocean cake + boat, super-sized Pocahontas poster.

Not just the desserts, the salads and meats are glorious. We always leave with 5x the number of items we walked in for."}
