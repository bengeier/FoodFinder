{"text":"1st time to this place. My coworker highly recommended it & best part was they have great  happy hour sushi menu & great price. Great service & ambiance defdefinitely will be back :)"}
{"text":"Although this is a very good restaurant and have been here often I found it crazy that my wife could not order off the child's menu.  She wasn't hungry but wanted a small portion.  We were told that it's only for kids.  Was a bit perplexed.  I would hope that no matter what the customer wants they should accommodate especially when it's not a request to do something that isn't on the menu.  This will increase loyalty and word of mouth.  Service industry. I hope that there is some flexibility in the service in the future."}
{"text":"v"}
{"text":"The food has been consistently good here. Everything else is hit or miss. This evening we waited over an hour for our food to arrive while freezing our bottoms off. While they clearly had short term heating issues, I've had enough inconsistent experiences with quality and speed of service to think twice next time we're in the mood for sushi."}
{"text":"Went back again on a Saturday night. The place was doing decent business, which is great to see. I hope it stays open.  This time I tried the Pink Lady Roll (highly recommend) and the Angel Roll."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! Very nice hostess! General tsos chicken amazing! Want to try other things but can't pass up the general tsos!! A few times they told us 1/2 hour wait and got seated within 5 minutes! I'm a regular now!"}
{"text":"Awesome! First I am not a sushi or roll fan but after having the Spider Roll, AAC Roll, Boston Roll and some roll with peanuts I am a fan. If you are not a fan because of the fishy seaweed taste give this place a try. Great flavor on the rolls. Dinners were excellent. I have had the S&S chicken and General Tso's and both were good size and excellen taste. Even my son who isn't a Asian food fan liked it. If you want great Asian and not a buffett this is the go to place."}
{"text":"As a Chinese tourist passing by the city, I should say food here is great even under Chinese standard. We are lucky to have such a wonderful restaurant near our hotel."}
{"text":"Great service. Great atmosphere. Amazing food. We ordered the Cheese flower and the Pink lady roll. The meat was cooked well and the food was delicious. It has become one of my favourite spots for dinner ."}
{"text":"I love the online ordering! Food is great. And I had great customer service! The sushi was great as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently moved to Parma from Seattle, WA. We had a tradition of getting sushi about once a week, and were thrilled to discover Blue Ginger after we moved here. It's about as good as any sushi I've had in Seattle. We go every week for the 50% off sushi. It's an incredible deal! Not all of the rolls are included, but it's a large enough selection that I haven't gotten bored yet.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the amount of sauce they put on the specialty rolls is excessive, but it's usually easy to scrape off. This place is not perfect, but it's about as good as a restaurant gets in my book, so I give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The sushi are very good here with a nice selection. Server was nice and attentive. However, the chicken in the stir fry dish is, let's just say very interesting looking and taste. Flimsy texture and does not taste like chicken or legit meat for that matter. Pad thai tastes like Chinese stir fry, not very authentic. They are new though so hopefully will be better"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. Thai calamari, spring  rolls, spicy scallop roll, and wonton soup were all really tasty. Pad Thai was quality but could have used more heat. My daughter really liked the pan fried noodles. Atmosphere was very nice."}
{"text":"Small place, but very modern looking and clean inside.  Some of the freshest tasting sushi I have had rivaling more expensive places (Parallax in Tremont and Pacific East in Coventry).  I always test sushi quality by ordering a rainbow roll at restaurants, this way they can't cover up old/non-fresh ingredients with loads of mayo/tempura.  The fish here (tuna, salmon, snapper) has a fresh non-fish nutty taste which is very good.  Their appetizers are also very tasty and fresh.  Lastly, the staff is very friendly, welcoming and never forgets to come by and check to see if you need anything else.  Great place, I would definitely check them out."}
{"text":"Blue Ginger has a great sushi special on Monday and Tuesdays. Love the peanut avocado roll as well as the tiger and pink lady special rolls. The wait staff is friendly and remembers you and sometimes even your order if you are a regular. The place is always clean and the service is polite and prompt."}
{"text":"New Asian Fusion Restaurant in Parma. Acme Plaza between Acme and TJ Maxx.  Had business box lunch specials takeout. I had the Shrimp Thai Basil. Shrimp was cooked great. Veggies were cooked but still crisp. Bonus sushi pieces we weren't expecting were very good. Sauce was delicious. Fried rice was a little bland until I mixed it with the leftover sauce.  Others in the family had Tempura Shrimp, Chicken Thai Basil and Shrimp with Garlic Sauce. Everyone was happy with the food. We got the salads, but saved them as we were full from the rest of the meal. Spring rolls were crisp and tasty as well.  At $9 each for lunch is was a little pricey. The current 15% off promotion was a big help.  All in all, we will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Stopped by in the late afternoon for a quick light dinner after traveling all day and just getting home.  I ordered a salmon roll and hot and sour soup may wife had pad tai. All was very good and served quickly (we were the only customers at the time).  The hot and sour soup is unlike any that I have had before with some tomatoes mushrooms and shrimp and lemongrass and cilantro floating in the bowl.      We also wanted some vegetables so ordered the hibachi vegetables without sauce. They were lightly seasoned and crisp tender, perfect for sharing for two.  We have even here several times in the past and will continue to come.  Never disappointed."}
{"text":"I've visited twice on the half-price sushi nights.  The first visit was with family, and the service was slow and our waitress was rude.  This place is definitely not child friendly.  There is no kids' menu, no changing tables, and the staff did not hide their displeasure at having to accommodate my two young, noisy, messy children.  The food was good, and the value was exceptional for the half-price menu.  I said I would come back, but never with the kids.  I did return without the kids, and my experience was great.  I would recommend the seaweed salad and the jalapeno roll."}
{"text":"The family and I enjoyed our meal late on a Sunday night. My son's tempura shrimp was a big plate and he loved it. My daughter had Lo Mein with chicken and she was ok with it. My wife loved the large sushi selection. Tons of rolls to choose from. The dynamite roll was fantastic. I had the General Tso's chicken and it was very good.   So it's sushi and chinese food, but with a higher quality plate. Good portions and very tasty.  Blue Ginger is tucked into a strip mall location, next to a TJMaxx. The decor is modern and clean and the food very good. We will repeat especially since it's so close to our home. Definitely a nice place and good food."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars because since I have left I have thought about how delicious their sushi is pretty much everyday! I cannot wait to go back and eat more sushi!  This review is based only on their sushi and nothing else as I did not try anything else.   My date and I ordered 5 rolls: the Shrimp and Asparagus Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Unbelievable Roll, Blue Ginger Roll and the Sunday Roll. Let's start with the Unbelievable Roll- I can't explain the cream cheese but it is not the typical cream cheese used at other places. This cream cheese is soft and wonderfully paired with the sushi roll. The other great thing about this roll is the red snapper. You don't see very many places with red snapper on the menu let a lone in a sushi roll and boy oh boy was it fantastic!! The Blue Ginger roll is the most expensive because it has both filet and lobster but every bite is worth the splurge! The Sunday Roll was more like a dessert roll to me because it is topped with Mango with a mango sauce. It was not overwhelming and it was a great roll to split up the flavors of the other rolls we ordered.  This is a sushi place worth checking out! The prices are right and the flavors are powerful and every bite is delicious!  *Note: Show your waiter/waitress the coupon online and you can get 20% off your entire bill"}
{"text":"Came in here with the family on a whim when we needed a close place for dinner. I knew this had just opened and briefly reviewed their extensive menu online. I thought it sounded like a good mid road kinda of place, not fast food Chinese or full on hibachi like Wasabi. We were pleasantly surprised!!!  The menu may be expansive but they do an amazing job on all of it! We had edamame and lettuce wraps for apps (awesome!), general tsaos chicken, pan fried noodle chicken, mango sauce shrimp, walnut shrimp and seafood treasure soup. Every single item was spot on. My brother and mother said the General tsaos was by far the best they ever had and I can say I would have never expected sweet pralined walnuts to go well with shrimp but it's was phenomenal. Even the broccoli and stringed beet garnish were prepared to perfection! I can't wait to return and experience their outrageous sushi/sashimi menu and hibachi. Our server told us the owner is the chef and she forwarded on our compliments :)   WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE IN THE AREA! Great low key date night spot with a beautiful bar and a great and knowledgable staff. (Mia, our server, was so sweet!)"}
{"text":"Warning... the service is really bad in here. My husband and I came here for the first time from Maryland. We ordered a seafood salad and we got a seaweed salad instead, than we ordered sushi we don't like fried one the sushi taste really bad when we complained. The manager treated us really bad she said if you don't like it the server will pay for it. we said no in the menu you guys didn't mention that it's fried she was like no temporary means fried. When I told her the server is new she doesn't know she said we're lying, she was rude to us. That's not how we treat new people"}
{"text":"Husband and I came here last night for the first time and was not disappointed!  Service was great and the food was even better!  We had the cheese flowers aka crab rangoons best we've ever had!  The general tso and hibachi combo was very good also.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times.  Here are the main takeaway points:  - AMAZING BEAUTIFUL FOOD PRESENTATION - Delicious saucy non-sushi dishes - Decent Sushi  The first time I went, it was on a whim with the husband, trying to find a new diamond in the rough... it was a diamond!  I got the chirashi, which was displayed pretty in a large oblong bowl.  The husband got a shrimp dish that had a yummy sauce on it.  It seems they do half-price sushi on Monday. They also have coupons on their website: http://www.bluegingeroh.com/  The worst thing about this place: - Their outdoor sign.  It's BLUE and it's impossible to see/read at night from the road because it's that weird blue color."}
{"text":"Walking in I was very impressed with the decor which is very upscale!  Hit happy hour so discount on drinks some sushi and entrees. Hubby had his favorite spicy tuna rolls which he said were really good, he also had the wonton soup that was steaming hot as it should be and tasty to boot. I had the Malaysian Samba with chicken. This is the first time I ever had this and it was beautifully presented and tasted delicious! Came with soup or salad and I asked for the salad they came with fresh ginger dressing. My meal was excellent! This is flagged as spicy on the menu but for me I will ask for it to be spicier. 2 blue Hawaiian cocktails to top it off with fantastic service!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and really enjoyed it.  I had the lunch special of 3 rolls for $11 or $12.  The sushi was very tasty.  It also came with a tiny salad or a miso soup.  My dinning partner ordered the lunch bento box with teriyaki chicken.  That had about a 1/2 cup rice, 3/4 of a cup chicken mixture, a small spring roll and four pieces of a California roll.  Everything in that was very tasty too.  It also came with the tiny salad and was $9.  Two of the staff that served us was friendly.  The only draw back was that the floor by us was wet from our boots and their tile has no traction.  So I was slipping my way out even with foot wear that has extra traction for winter.   I'll gladly go back here, but not to often due to not getting the most for your money.  For the prices they charge, you can find places just as tasty but that give you more."}
{"text":"I decided to branch out and try sushi from somewhere different, and I'm so glad I did! Blue Ginger blew my expectations out of the water. I tried the Parma Roll, spicy yellowtail and seaweed salad. All three things were so delicious! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Blue Ginger is a new Asian restaurant in the SE Corner of Parma in the Acme plaza at Pleasant Valley and Broadview Roads. They have been open three weeks. We came in at 5:30 PM on a Saturday and there were about 20 people - some couples, some groups including a few families with kids. We were greeted and seated immediately and our drink orders were taken quickly. The menu covers a broad swath of Asia - available are Japanese soups and noodle dishes, sushi, Thai curries and Chinese entrees. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and the staff was courteous and attentive. We ordered two pieces of sushi and a spicy tuna roll and they were delivered to the table in short order. The salad from our also-ordered sweet and sour chicken and the tempura shrimp for an udon bowl came shortly after. The sushi and tuna roll were very good and the tempura shrimp was perfectly cooked; crisp panko and tender juicy shrimp. I should point out that I rarely comment on salads in Asian restaurants; salad is never great in an Asian restaurant and is such a western addition to Asian cuisine that I think it should be avoided in favor of soup....but that wasn't my order. The sweet and sour chicken came with the sauce on the side and perfectly fried chicken served with flash-fried peppers, onions and sweet pineapple. All of the dishes were presented well and tasted fine. There was no new ground broken in the presentation, preparation or flavors and everything was quite good and just as one would expect. No disappointments but no stunning revelations either.  The price was agreeable, though. Two pieces of sushi, spicy tuna roll, sweet and sour chicken, Udon bowl and drinks came to $35. My family is such that we could easily order a Thai dish, a Chinese dish, a Japanese dish and some sushi were it only possible.....and now it's possible for what we consider a pretty affordable price, with good quality food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Food is fresh, service was great!  What a hidden gem in Parma!  We will be making regular appearances in the future!"}
{"text":"Gave this a try on a Wednesday (Jan 14th)  with 2 friends. Came a little later, after 8 pm, was  quiet.   Calvin, the manager, was very attentive, and helpful. Restaurant itself was clean, inviting We wanted to try a little bit of everything- Started with deluxe sushi dinner- Fish was very fresh, generous portions- Very pleased with the quality. Next, Calvin recommended a special dinner, Chilean sea bass over asparagus- Again, all 3 of us were impressed- Fish cooked just right, excellent sauce ( had some nuts in it)-was light, complemented the fish well. Last, we had a green curry with chicken, beef, and shrimp- Perfect! We tried a bottle of sake, and Calvin offered us a sample of a few others, all excellent Finished the dinner with assorted ice cream- green tea, bean, and vanilla-  Very impressed with food and service ( Waitress was Amy) Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Over the past 2 years I've been at this restaurant about 5 times and each time I say \"never again.\" Every time we go it's horrible service and lack luster quality of sushi. Tonight I felt like I was at a playground while trying to eat. There was a party of 10 there with 4 kids that literally ran laps around the place the whole hour we were there. I wish I was making this up. How do the parents just turn a blind eye like they own the place? So rude. And nobody said anything to them either.  Granted, the server did apologize to us about his lack of service while giving us the check. After tonight's debacle, I wont be spending anymore money there."}
{"text":"Today I ordered pick up and I was impressed by how quickly it was ready. The staff was incredibly friendly. I love that you are able to order online here!   My food was amazing. The mushroom soup is a must try! It is so delicious and is exactly what I crave when I feel under the weather. The salads that they serve with their entrees is amazing. They have a creamy ginger dressing that is unlike ginger dressings I've tried elsewhere!   Their steak pad thai was phenomenal. It was a large portion and is amazing!! It's tangy and delicious."}
{"text":"I met a friend up here today for lunch. They don't serve on Sunday's yet so be prepared for that. The calamari was good, crispy and not too chewy. The avocado salad was very good although the dressing was kind of a mayo consistency I didn't care for. I got the dragon roll, awesome and the Special roll, fire cracker and it was HUGE. Both were huge. When I saw the server carrying it I thought for sure it was someone else's. All in all a great place. I would return."}
{"text":"Not as impressive as most of the other Chinese restaurants in town.  It's not BAD, but also not the best.  I had the hibachi and a few different appetizers."}
{"text":"The family and I love this place. Staff is always friendly and great customer service. Inside is decorated nicely and very clean.   This is not your typical hole in the wall Chinese. I usually get the General Tso's Chicken which is always tender and juicy (no mystery gristle) and if you like Sushi they have dozens of options. Sushi is always fresh and made to order. Half price Sushi on Mon/Tues...  Haven't tried their soup yet but the ginger dressing that comes on the salad is fantastic. Hibachi seems popular as we'll but haven't tried that either.   Full bar but not many beer sections which is disappointing. Full cocktail menu. My girl and I had the Volcano Bowl for Two last time which was pretty much a fruity Long Island with 151 rum that knocked us on our asses."}
{"text":"I think I've had the best spicy salmon roll ever here. There food is also superb!! Everything I've had here is delicious. I love going here on Mondays or Tuesday's for half off sushi ALL DAY! Even if your not a sushi person I would recommend getting it here cause it will change the way you think about sushi!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Got a carry out for 4 on my husbands birthday. 4 dinners sushi, crab ran goons and calamari. All the dinners were great.  We ordered on line. Food came out fast and hot. I will be going again soon. The only item a little disappointing was the calamari. Small amount and tough for the $10. Our favorite was the Hawaii five o. I will try the XO seafood delight next time. Garlic shrimp just right."}
{"text":"Hibachi style food, excellent quality, service and atmosphere at very reasonable prices.  Sushi rolls are always well done and with great presentation.  You will not be disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"We decided it was time to try and find a decent Asian place in the Parma area.  Blue Ginger definitely is going to remain on our must go to places.  The ambiance was very welcoming.  All the servers were very friendly.  Our server crystal was great.  We never ran out of water and she constantly made sure we had our food in a timely manner.  My husband got the rainbow roll and said it was delicious.  We shared lettuce wraps and they were about on par if not better than PF Changs.  The Szechwan beef was slightly disappointing since it wasn't very spicy.  But the general tsos was delicious.  The pad Thai was great too.  Highly recommend if you're looking for a decent priced Asian food place and sushi.  Just remember that they have coupons in their website."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. Comfortable booths and tables with cushioned chairs. A large full service bar is in the back. Great tables for large groups. The food was fantastic!  Very fresh and delicious. The presentation was excellent. We had Shrimp Tempura, California Rolls and Crab Rangoon. All superb!  Entrees we ordered were Bacon Wrapped Scallops, Red Snapper and Teriyaki Chicken. All great and not a bit of food leftover. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Oh we love this restaurant!  We have come numerous times and have always had delicious food!  We are big-time sushi lovers...and I can't say enough good things about this place.  Delicious, delicious, delicious!"}
{"text":"So far, take out twice. Scottish Salmon (yes, i know, it really IS an Asian Bistro though) is to die for. Love the veggies and the sauce. Last trip ordered hibachi salmon and scallops, served with soup salad and fried rice, also delicious seafood. They also have sushi. If you go before 3:00pm except Sunday, there are many lunch choices/deals.  The menu is extensive and I will most definitely return."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places in the area I've found that has that crazy honey walnut shrimp menu item that is ubiquitous on West coast menus.  I literally know of one other place that has it.  Yes I know it's pan fried shrimp in condensed milk and mayo. But when you tasted it for the first time at 16 while vacationing in San Francisco you kind of associate it with that magic feeling of eating some \"exotic\" in an exotic place.  I get nostalgic sometimes, this place fills that niche, and for that I'm grateful. The only thing it's missing is the insanely hot little peppers that came as a garnish at the place I first tried the dish. Also the sushi is pretty top notch.  All in all give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a great find! I'm glad we were finally able to try out this place. It did not disappoint. Awesome sushi and good service, very attentive. We came on a Sunday, no deals on the sushi, but domestic beer was $2 and imports were $3. Not bad. Regular prices are decent for food and drinks alike. Our server even informed us of the half price sushi on Mondays and Tuesdays, including the special rolls!  We ordered the Spider and Parma Rolls to start along with a couple of import beers. High quality sushi and our beers were served in chilled glasses. Next, we ordered the Sweet Potato Crunch and Dynamite Rolls. The portions were more than enough.  I can't wait to check them out on Mondays!"}
{"text":"We have been here 4 times in 3 months and love this place.  The curry & Pat Thai had good flavor and our kids liked the fried rice options.  Sushi was also good.  Great Asian options for a good value in a comfortable sit down environment.  Service was attentive.  I ate at the sushi bar on one of my visits and found the chef to be fun to talk to in addition to preparing great rolls.  We plan to make this a regular place to eat."}
{"text":"Ok, I've been looking for a quality Chinese restaurant in the parma/seven hills area for three years. Every place has a short coming. Lack of quality, too salty, too little food etc. I see the massive sign for 15% off this place and give some carry out a try. Finnnnaaallllyyyy a nice meal. Top rate chicken and breading for the sweet and sour. All white meat general sooooooaaass. Excellent spring rolls. The place is brand new and clean. The prices are a bit high but the quality is there."}
{"text":"My aunt and uncle were in town from Arizona and we wanted to go out to dinner for her birthday.  She was craving Chinese food since she was pretty sick of Tex Mex out west, so we tried to find a sit-down place nearby that happened to have Chinese food.  This restaurant kept popping up in our search so we decided to try it out...  Driving by the shopping plaza with Dollar Deals on one side and TJ Maxx on the other, it would have been easy to miss Blue Ginger (definitely not somewhere I would have just walked in to).  Once you walk in the door, however, you forget that you're in a strip mall; it is very clean and decorated in a modern and comfortable way.  The hostess was friendly and we were seated right away.    We ordered a pretty big selection of appetizers (cheese flowers, chicken skewers, lettuce wraps, and egg rolls), and were very pleased with all of them... they were very flavorful!  For my meal, I order the general tso chicken, and it came with either soup or salad and your choice of rice.  I opted for the wonton soup and was very happy with my choice!  The broth was flavorful and the wontons were soft and full of delicious filling.  The chicken for my entree was also scrumptious; it had a definite kick to it (one member of our party found it too spicy but I love a little spice in my food so I was very happy).  The fried rice was full of flavor as well... they certainly aren't afraid of seasoning the food here!  I cleaned my plate (even after those appetizers) as did the rest of the table!    I'll definitely be coming back again!    Don't forget to look for coupons on their website... we got 20% off our entire meal!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here for a few years.  It's truly one of the best.  I've tried many dishes.  Sushi rolls, Wok entrees, etc.  never had a bad meal (or lunch).  Mia is awesome.  My grandson is 18 months and she and her staff are always so kind.  We go there all the time and plan to keep in going."}
{"text":"I apologize if this review is a bit harsh but when you put down \"toro\" aka fatty tuna in your menu, you've set some expectations. While the toro was unfortunately unavailable when I visited, we tried the other offerings. Sadly the sushi rolls were a disappointment, but spicy mayo can help save the day.. And they had a lot of it. American sushi at its finest. Surprisingly, the salmon was actually fresh and had a rich/buttery flavor. My bland salmon roll might have been the best thing I ate that night.  Ah well maybe next time I'll end up getting to try some toro and recant my words."}
{"text":"It's a shame there isn't a 10 Star selection on YELP, because Blue Ginger deserves it! You must try this fantastic place out!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi for a decent price.  Friendly service and great Happy Hour!  We go as often as we can even though it's a thirty minute drive with no traffic.  They even have riceless sushi rolls which is great for keto or persons with diabetes like me!"}
{"text":"I've gotten carry out from here multiple times and each time I'm more and more blown away but how amazing the food is. Not your typical Asian restaurant! Quality food, every time. Not too expensive either. Definitely worth every penny, every time."}
{"text":"The sushi here is absolutely wonderful. We also tried the Hibachi and the scallops were amazing. My family and I believe this to be the best place for either type of food in the greater Cleveland area."}
{"text":"After eagerly searching for a place to go for my sisters birthday dinner we decided to try our this new Asian place only minutes from our house. For a strip mall Asian restaurant we were pleasantly surprised by the nice modern decorated interior and quality and presentation of the food. The only thing is that the hibachi isn't performed in front of you like a normal hibachi place it's in the kitchen but the food is the same. They also have a nice sushi menu. The service was great and everything was pretty affordable I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Big disappointment. The Hibachi is cooked then covered in teriyaki sauce which is not on the menu. The chicken was cooked plain then dumped into the teriyaki sauce. The waitress forgot the soup and salad. When I told her that the teriyaki was not on the menu and is not typical for hibachi. She came out with the more traditional sauces and said dip in that. I would not come back here maybe try the sushi. The mixed green salad was only ice berg.  They have us 10% off. Would give zero stars."}
{"text":"Horrific Service (Peter)  Dined here with a group of friends. The server Peter was unwelcoming, short tempered and definitely felt women were beneath him. No recommended or explanation of meals, no beverage refills, snotty answers to women and the restaurant was not busy so he had the time to serve the table properly.  The dinner was delicious and presented well from the kitchen.  My order was missing items that were to come with it. He knew this but, did not correct the situation when asked.   A total Asshol#.  He made the dinner which would have been fun & delightful a nightmare!  I will not be dining here again.  NOT recommended"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Blue Ginger about 10 times since I moved to the area, and I'd be lying if I said the food was anything short of great. I can't speak to the sushi, because I haven't had it (yet,) but there's a reason I keep going back. Some of my favorites:  Shrimp Shumai: if I could only eat one thing for the rest of my life, this would be it.  Cheese Flowers: your take-out joint calls them Rangoon. What I like about these is that they're topped with a mango sauce.  Rock Shrimp: giant prawns with a sauce I'd like to take a bath in.  Mango Sauce with Chicken: a different sauce that what comes on the cheese flowers - a nice balance of sweet and heat.  Four stars because I believe there is always room for improvement."}
{"text":"The people running it are awful. The lady stood behind our waiter just watching him as orders lined up. They mistreat their wait staff and have super slow service. We had to wait over an hour to get served food. It was in our lunch break and we ended up having to take it all to go. So much for lunch. Pass going here!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Blue Ginger. Food was excellent with Four Treasures and sweet and sour chicken. The four treasures had beef, chicken, scampis and shrimp . It was excellent as was the sweet and sour chicken! As well, the mushroom soup, not your typical, was very good. Service is excellent with server Wendy. And finally the bar menu is extensive. Dirty martini was made well! This is not the typical Asian restaurant. The attention to detail and presentation of food was above standard. We will definitely frequent Blue Ginger! Don't let the fact that it is in a shopping center keep you away. Definitely a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Many thanks to fellow Yelpers. Would not have found this place if not for Yelp. Would not have tried without your accurate and fair reviews recommending. Great service. In an older plaza but remodeled very well. Very clean and modern. Broad menu. Sushi and sushi rolls were excellent.  Reasonable drink prices. Will go back."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland on business and I had a craving for some sushi. I was considering going downtown but Blue Ginger was closer to my hotel and had really good reviews, so I took a chance. I'm so glad because it was awesome!   The restaurant is tucked away in the back of a rather unassuming strip mall next to a nail salon. I almost drove by it. Once inside, I noticed it was really modern and clean. They did really nice things with the space they had (the restaurant is not really large but they made it seem more spacious than it is).   I had a seat at the bar and was given a menu right away. Their wine list is not extensive but the wines are decent, good price too, ranging from 6-8$/glass. On Mondays they had half off many rolls so that was nice, some rolls were only $2.50. I decided to get the nigiri because that typically tells you how good a sushi place really is. Now, let me say I typically never eat at \"Asian restaurants\" that serve multiple cuisines, i.e.- Chinese, Japanese, Thai, etc. I think it's hard to do them all because while they do have overlapping elements, each cuisine is an art form of its own. But the pictures and reviews got me in the door.  The nigiri come one piece in an order, most nigiri are cheap on their menu. I think they should raise the price for the quality of what they offer. I got the salmon, yellowtail, and tuna. I also got a spicy California roll and an order of gyoza. The gyoza were cooked perfectly and were handmade. The California roll was well done, the roll was full of ingredients that were all fresh and it didn't fall apart or anything like that. The nigiri- yum! The pieces of fish they use are simply gigantic. Really great quality to the fish too, very fresh, it was cut well, just the right amount of wasabi and the rice was also on point. One of the best nigiri I've had outside of Japan. I was still hungry because I eat a lot so I ordered a dragon roll. It was also delicious. The avocado on top was like butter and the eel inside was very well cooked, soft and flavorful.   I wish I lived closer because I definitely would eat here all the time."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great sushi and incredible value - especially their half-price sushi night!"}
{"text":"We had been here 4 times before and were pleased by the quality of the food and the pleasant sit down atmosphere (although the air conditioning tends to be too cold).  On Sunday August 28 we were the first customers there.  The waitress had difficulty with English.  The delay was longer than usual, but eventually two of our three orders came out, they were ice cold.  When we managed to get the waitress's attention she told us to feel the bottom of the plates (???).  Sorry, but this is the last time that we are coming here."}
{"text":"The service and the sushi here is fantastic. Their 50% off on Monday and Tuesday are the best sushi deal in town. You have to give this place a try."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good sushi place in Cleveland and this was one of the first places I've tried, based on good Yelp reviews and the 50% off days on Monday and Tuesday. This is the best deal ever!  There is a special \"Up to 50% off\" menu that has a wide variety of sushi rolls, special sushi rolls, and a few appetizers. Most of the rolls are in the $3 range for regular rolls and $6-$8 for special rolls.   We ordered 10 rolls plus 3 appetizers for 3 people and it was a ton of food. We could not finish everything. We took almost 2 full rolls home. We tried a variety of things and it was all very good. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because all of the sushi is overpowered by sauces put on top. Eel sauce, spicy sauce etc. With that, you could not really tell if the fish was of superior quality or not. Most of the taste was coming from the toppings rather than the fish itself.  Everything tasted very fresh, but none of the fish stood out as the highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"I found this place right here on Yelp. It was packed when we got here. Wait not long at all. Food is phenomenal. You can tell that the food is cooked by a chef, not a cook. My sushi was to die for and hubby's Mongolian Beef was wonderful."}
{"text":"Half price sushi Monday and Tuesdays,  fresh, inventive and best deal in town.   Tastefully decorated,  fast service and they remember their customers.  Can't wait to come back next week."}
{"text":"This place impressed me. It is in kind of a bad location not noticeable from the street on Pleasant Valley and Broadview road however through word-of-mouth I've heard about this place and when I went... Wow. Some of the best sushi I've ever had, The Chinese food on the menu was much better than 90% of the Chinese places in the area.  The quality of the food was exceptional. I keep on craving this place but just haven't got back yet. I will be back for sure.   UPDATE: I have been here since and had the worse service expierence of my life. First we got our food which with it a doubt is delicious, but no utensils. So we waited over 10 min after asking for them. I recommended this place to friends so we went and they were disappointed. I rarely tip under 20% and I'm pretty sure I tipped less than 15%."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Super fresh, great staff, phenomenal presentation, attention to detail. I highly recommend hitting this place up. Perfect for lunch as well."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love 2 for 1 sushi two days a week? Let me rephrase that... Who doesn't love 2 for 1 sushi that is great? Presentation, flavor, freshness all A+. Newer gem in Parma that's worth the trip even at full price."}
{"text":"We had a so-so experience. The unbelievable roll, or any roll with cream cheese, has way too much cream cheese in it. I suggest ordering light cream cheese. The service was good, but there was nothing special about the sushi or the food we ordered."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this restaurant while shopping near by! Our server Kyle was awesome! Very attentive and had great suggestions with the menu! Coconut chicken soup was delicious! The blue ginger roll (surf and turf) was simply awesome...it was like a whole meal rolled into one!!! Definitely recommend that and the fried cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Awesome food great place half price sushi Monday and Tuesday nights. I recomend the walnut shrimp and the hibachi is great too."}
{"text":"Kind of a strange place. It's Asian modern, however it was super warm, no A/C.  We got here arounnd 2:50 pm. We asked for lunch menus, and in very broken English the waitress said lunch was over.  I asked when is lunch over? Server advised 3pm. I looked at my watch and  advised it was not yet three. She said it is 50% off sushi day. I advised I wanted lunch and after a little bit of bickering, we got lunch menus. 2 sashimi lunches.  Salad dressing was a fabulous ginger dressing. Perfect consistency not like mayonnaise glop that some places serve.  Miso soup was a little watered down.  Sashimi, was good, tuna was deep red and melted in the mouth. Escolar was fresh. Salmon was the best of the 3 as it unusually is on the north coast.  I would come back again"}
{"text":"I guess I have an unpopular opinion here but the sushi was not good. We ordered like 8 special rolls between the two of us and I couldn't find anything I liked. The rolls were average. Everything was drenched in sauces. I'm not opposed to that if pulled off right but it was not right in this case. I couldn't taste the ingredients. Just the sauces. Might as well just give me the sauce bottles and I'll go to town on them, Harry and Lloyd style.   The place is nice and clean and the service is friendly and attentive, but I just didn't enjoy the food."}
{"text":"This is such a great sushi place. We go a few times a month and have become regulars. Always fresh and very clean."}
{"text":"Went back on a Tuesday to try the special Sushi menu.  This time my experience was more Like 3-4 stars.  The regular rolls were between 2-3$.  Speciality rolls were between 6-8$.  The regular rolls were very average - the best was the sweet potato tempura.  The spicy tuna was decent and the spider roll w soft shell crab was not very good.  My friends mexican maki and crazy tuna were much more creative and flavorful.  This place is quite a drive for me but I went because my previous experience of thai and chinese food has been good.  I think if in the area its worth a try but not worth a thirty minute drive on its own."}
{"text":"Let's just say - clueless manager and a hostess that cost the manager a six top and most likely a $110 plus tab.  We were told by the hostess, after she spoke to the manager, if we eat quickly then they will let us sit down, otherwise, no.  I can accept, \"I'm sorry but we are full tonight\".  But to say, \"if you eat fast then I'll seat you\" in other words, pay me to rush you and your family out of here, is unacceptable.  It is understandable if they have large reservations set up already but the way we were talked to was beyond ignorant and the worst we have been treated at a restaurant.  Blue Ginger, you are a service industry business.  Buy a clue.  This was our first time walking in the door and most likely our last by the way were treated.  This is what happens when a manager (don't know if she owns the place) lets a hostess run her mouth.  Wake up, Blue Ginger!  Rude is not in en vogue!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this a 4 and 3/4 star! I was very excited to try this place and was worried when I couldn't locate it off the main stretch of Pleasant Valley. When I learned that it was located in the strip mall, I was skeptical - Boy was I wrong!!! We started with the spicy garlic edammame, vegetable dumplings and spicy tuna roll - All three were THE BEST I've ever had. Fresh, tasty and a perfect ménage to the start of a family dinner. We then all had the clear broth soup and ginger dressing salad - YUM!!  By this time I was almost full, but my warm tea helped me make room for our main entrees! My mother got the chicken with mixed vegetables wok, looked so amazing and tasted equally as fabulous. My fiancé order the Blue Ginger Roll and Trio Sushi Sampler - The Blue Ginger Roll was $16 - but included lobster and filet and was WELL WORTH it! He enjoyed it very mush! (That is a little too much in one roll for me) My sister and I split the vegetable hibachi and it was OK. The ginger dipping sauce was incredible and a little spicy, which I love - and the shrimp sauce was too mayonnaisey and sweet. All in all, we would return, the service was impeccable and they offered us a 15% discount for no reason - We will most definitely be going back and recommending this to friends. I'm so happy to see a sushi place in this area!! I took some great pictures and can't wait to upload them!! (Blue Ginger Roll came with a  cool display!)"}
{"text":"First time here, and it was a joy. Great food, great presentation, and service.... I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere! The food was good. It definitely seemed like it should have been downtown and not in Parma. My boyfriend is vegan and some of the vegan type sushi had yum sauce (?) on it which is mayonnaise based so we sent it back. It came out quickly and he really enjoyed it. Sake wine was good, too!"}
{"text":"The sushi and drinks were good but, I think the server gave us chicken based soup even after we made it clear we were vegan. Gave me cream based dipping sauce for hibachi. I looked up the soup I was given, the closest thing is chicken based. Very upset by that. To have a guest specifically ask about vegan food and bring non vegan is wrong. Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Blue Ginger is a hidden gem. Most people think you need to downtown CLE to get good sushi... But not if you know about Blue Ginger. The Mountain View Roll is delicious and huge! The rice is soft, sticky and yummy. The rolls are no doubt fresh. The sweet and sour chicken crispy on the outside and tender and juicy inside, our kids love it. The daily happy hours help the price. Our family of four costs about $60 including a glass of wine. (Does not include gratuity). We over ordered by probably one roll, but we still ate it because it was so yummy."}
{"text":"Wow!  Beautiful food presentation and incredibly flavorful food!! We got the cheese flowers...and they were wrapped so delicately they were practicAlly art! The seaweed salad was the best ive ever had! The sushi was picture perfect and melt in your mouth quality! The bar is impressive is well with affordable draft brews as well as some really funky  expertly crafted cocktails. I keep it simple with a glass of plum wine, which was a generous pour for the price and was perfectly sweet. Decor is very chill and lighting is soft and romantic. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So awesome. They have amazing lunch deals every day but Sunday. I got three rolls for $11. The spicy tuna, spicy Kani and eel w avocado. I went with two of my friends. Service and food was speedy and tasty. I will go back as much as possible!"}
{"text":"very impressed with the quality of the food and service. I sampled the saba nigiri (mackerel) which was fresh and firm.  The Thai Sweet and Sour soup is spicy. Not dumbed down for gringos and flavorful. The Thai Basil Chicken was very good... I just wish they would offer an authentic version of it with ground chicken instead of large pieces of chicken.   I stuck with a solid vodka martini, instead of \"cocktail\" from the list. They did a good job with that too!   I'm looking forward to trying their Monday and Tuesday Special Sushi Night."}
{"text":"I love Blue Ginger. I've been a loyal customer for over a year. My favorite menu item is Sashimi regular. The fish is always fresh and the portions are always large! Their sushi rolls and fried rice is also yummy! If you'd like to visit Blue Ginger for lunch, you're in luck! They have lunch specials that are cheaper and more tasty than all the competition in the area. If you're in the area and craving sushi stop by Blue Ginger. Your taste buds will thank you!!"}
{"text":"We love this place and just keep coming back!! Monday and Tuesday's for lunch they have 50% off sushi special!! Found that out yesterday and we took advantage. Always great food and service!"}
{"text":"Just left this restaurant for date night with my husband. Everything was wonderful! Our server was attentive and friendly. The food was wonderful! We also ordered the volcano bowl for two drink. So delicious! I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a date evening with friends/ family. The waterfall wall that changes color is a nice touch ! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Changing to 4 stars because I found some special rolls that were actually pretty good. Would recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"The dinner was very good and the service was outstanding also. I had the teriyaki chicken box and soup my mother had the sesame chicken and the salad. Every thing was fresh. And it was $8 a meal at lunch time."}
{"text":"Sushi is half off Monday and Tuesday here! That's when I come eat at Blue Ginger. I  usually come here with my mom and my sister. The sushi is fresh and there's a lot of variety! So good,  :)!"}
{"text":"So I usually come here just for the cheap sushi fix but I believe this will be my last visit here.. I'm not new to the menu or the people that work there from when they opened.  The sushi has been very inconsistent lately and the fish is not as fresh as it used to be.  I came here with some friends to get some sushi for half off but we sat at the bar because one of my friends wanted to drink as well.  It was pretty busy when we walked in too so we thought sitting at the bar would cut the wait time.  There was an older gentleman there who was the bartender and I couldn't catch his name (probably because he didn't give it t me).  He was pretty slow with his service even though we were the only ones at the bar and the other 2 couples were waiting for their checks.  We waited a good 10 minutes before he asked us what we wanted to drink and a good 30 minutes for our sushi which isn't so bad since we ordered a lot.  When we were ordering the bartender thought it would be funny if he made a joke about his coworkers to me and stated \"They don't speak English.\" When I'm pretty sure the Caucasian bartender just spoke English to these sushi chefs to give them our orders.  So it already gave me a bad taste in my mouth that this guy continued with the Asian jokes when I'm clearly Asian and not laughing.   My sushi wasn't that great as well.  I ordered a sushi roll with the word \"smokey\" in it and so did my friend but of course his was cooked and mine wasn't which tasted different and not satisfying.   I also ordered a spicy tuna in which they gave me a spicy salmon instead. He charged me extra for having my sauce on the side but didn't charge my friends.  Also the soft shell crab doesn't taste fresh or good for that matter.  Even though they cooked it you could taste the frost bite on the soft shell crab roll.  Overall horrible experience with the food and service.. And I just wanted to say that if you decide to work at an Asian restaurant you should probably hold back on the Asian jokes especially when your customer is Asian."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Great service, great decor, and amazing Sushi.  If you want to stay away from the raw side, try the Dragon & Phoenix under the Chef's Specialties. So good.   Dine-in is great, but I love the online ordering abilities for carry-out.  Have to drop it down a star.  Literally 15 mins after my 5 star review, I placed a to go order.   Got home to find the salad and sauce for the cheese flowers was missing.  Mistakes happen.  My fault for not checking the bag.  But I can't go 5 stars.  Maybe another update after a few more successful orders.  :)"}
{"text":"I've been going here close to a year now, it's a good neighborhood Asian restaurant with a good selection of stir fry, Chinese, teriyaki dishes.   Good selection of appetizers.  Good alcohol selection. Good customer service."}
{"text":"Great food , great service and reasonable price . Local owner , Mia is a pleasure to meet and a wonderful host - Zeny provided outstanding service , friendly and very attentive . I will most definitely recommend this to all my friends !  I'm from NY / NJ area and have eaten at some of the finest Asian restaurants , Blue Ginger has surpassed all .   Congratulations Mia !   I will be back ! Mike"}
{"text":"Great service and awesome dishes!  The vegetarian sushi combo is amazing and has even turned my husband on to sushi!  The atmosphere is very nice as well"}
{"text":"Came upon this sushi spot by accident and was deliciously surprised. We ordered edamame as an appetizer on a Tuesday when they were doing up to 50% select sushi rolls and apps. Our 2 year old loved the little soy beans. We got a little side of fried rice and the yaki soba noodle dish. Both delicious. We also ordered the the Magic roll, Naruto roll, spider roll, parma roll, and the smoky roll. The presentation was beautiful and our meal cam out relatively fast. It was super busy for a Tuesday but worth the wait. Amazing spot for sushi in the cleveland area."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Had steak hibachi; cooked perfectly as requested. My boyfriend had Sesame Chicken, also delicious! All the sushi that we have tried was delicious! Better flavor and quality than some more higher priced places around town. Service was great. Drink specials yummy! Would soooo recommend."}
{"text":"I went here with my family on a Sunday afternoon for lunch, the waiter was rude, and everything we got was inedible. I got the pad thai, and it was terrible. The chicken was deep fried, and 90% fat. I can safely say that Giant Eagle's pad thai is eons better. My brother got the hibachi, and it was slightly better than mine, but still dismal. The vegetables were mush, and the fried rice was burned to a crisp. One star is generous for this place."}
{"text":"Over an hour wait for two sushi rolls and one stir-fry dish. Waitress claimed the kitchen was backed up but that was clearly not the case as at least two other tables came in after us, ate, paid, and left before our food arrived. There was also no sense of urgency from any members of the staff that I could see. An in-experienced server is something that happens, but the fact that management didn't notice or care that a two-top sat for 70 minutes without food or drink refills is unacceptable. The food when it arrived was extremely underwhelming considering the wait."}
{"text":"Great food, lovely presentation. Nice surprise for a shopping center restaurant. Ordered way too much food though :-)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the sushi, they have a great deal with the 50% off! I would love to try this place for dinner! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"It's very good on Monday and Tuesday here because of their half price sushi not only sushi but also rolls and some other stuffs  I have never been there other than Monday Tuesday but should be okay place to eat casual sushi"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. Fast friendly service.  Great value and lots of options. 3 rolls and soup for $11.00"}
{"text":"We love to go here for lunch or on Tuesdays for half price sushi. Today I had the 2 sushi roll lunch special for $8. Loved it. The rolls were great & the service was quick. Haven't tried other meals here, but the sushi is on point!"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out based on the reviews with a girlfriend after work. Love this place. Our waitress Wendy was so adorable and kept the conversation going as the night and wine progressed. Thought the sushi was fantastic. The pot stickers were great too. Wine is only 5 bucks a glass too!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and we had a great experience. We had 3 rolls and all of them were great! Service was great as well. Not overpriced."}
{"text":"I was planning to meet a friend for Sushi at another restaurant - Charm Thai (delicious, by the way). But their sushi chef was not in attendance today. So, i did a quick search on Yelp for sushi nearby. Blue Ginger came up. Neither of us had heard of it. But it just happened to be located in the plaza across the street, so we headed over.   The inside is beautiful and we were sat and served beverages immediately. To our delight, we were given a 50% off sushi menu. This menu is active every Monday and Tuesday at lunch. The descriptions were clear and the special rolls looked delicious!  So we ordered, and what came was some super tasty sushi plated beautifully. The dynamite roll was....well....dynamite. Fresh, flavorful, and wonderful. Looking forward to exploring the menu more next week.  They also have other dishes inspired from different countries throughout southeast Asia. You can just tell right from the beginning that everything on the menu is going to be stunning.   Delicious sushi in Parma? Serious? YES!! GO THERE!!!!"}
{"text":"I am so tempted to give 5 stars bc everything was near perfect. The atmosphere was just a pinch off key for me. Most of the menu on mon and tue is 50% off! The sushi was fresh and creative - a steal at 50% off! The cocktails  are perfect, service good, and staff friendly. A must try!"}
{"text":"It's a great spot to bring guests.  They don't usually expect to find such a gem of a restaurant in Seven Hills/Broadview Heights"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It was a lot nicer than what I expected. They have a great selection of sushi and other Asian dishes. I got the spider roll and it was delicious. My boyfriend got the chicken with mango and fried rice which was really tasty, it was different than what we expected but he really enjoyed it. You can order online too which is cool. I would have given five stars but they took about 15 minutes to seat us even though there was barely anyone in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh, with nice presentation. Love the General Tso's chicken, Sesame Chicken, CA roll, onion soup, and salad w/fresh ginger dressing. Restaurant has a nice trendy contemporary style and always clean."}
{"text":"Still my favorite place to get Asian Cuisine in the Cleveland/Parma/Broadview area IMO. The food is great and the sushi rolls are reasonably priced. Go here all the time. Generals chicken is the best I've had in town, yet all the food is great."}
{"text":"Great food, great environment, great place. The first time I came here was with my parents, sisters, aunt, and uncle when my aunt and uncle were in town from Arizona. My aunt was craving Chinese food so we were searching for a nice sit down place that had some sort of Asian cuisine online.   At first we were a little skeptical of coming here because it was a little Asian bistro in a strip mall with TJ maxx on one side and a dollar store on the other.   To our surprise, the restaurant was very nice and modern inside. The hostess was friendly and we were seated right away. Our waiter was friendly and served his purpose.   We got a variety of appetizers including dumplings. Everything seemed to be pretty good. For my entree, I ordered General Tso's chicken that came with your choice of rice and either clear soup, wanton soup, or salad. I decided to get wanton soup and fried rice. The soup was very good with good filling and the chicken and rice was very, very good. The portion of chicken was huge and I was able to take a lot home.   Since then, Blue Ginger has been our go-to Asian take out."}
{"text":"Sushi is fresh and great portions.  Cooked food, such as hibachi and Thai curries are very tasty   They also have good deals.  Finally, the service is amazing. I have been a customer now for more than a few years.   My favorite Sushi/hibachi place in this area!"}
{"text":"So happy we found this restaurant.   Have been here 4 times in the last 2 weeks.   Food is fresh and wonderfully prepared.   Love the coconut chicken soup. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi! Can't beat the seaweed salad or the Kani salad. I recommend to all. Chef special rolls are all unique and delicious"}
{"text":"Great fish here!  Ordered the sushi and sashimi combo dinner and the quality and freshness was awesome!  The tempura shrimp appetizer was not nearly as good as it is elsewhere otherwise this would have gotten 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I look forward to coming here! Abundance of food and reasonable price, I have always left satisfied."}
{"text":"Excited to have a decent sushi place in my hood. Go to the website and print out a 20% coupon! Monday and Tuesday's are 50% sushi and Wednesday thru Saturday indulge in happy hour 3-5:30pm for cheap alcohol and sushi. Big selection to choose from. Ginger dressing on the salad very fresh. Miso soup was a bit watery. I had sashimi lunch, got 9 good size pieces. No sushi rice on the side just plain rice. Lots of parking. Cute clean and trendy inside. Would have given it a 5 stars but our waitress ruined the experience"}
