{"text":"Where to begin? 

        First, this place offers exceptional customer service. The bartender, Stephen, was on top of it all night and made sure I never sat with an empty beer! The servers Mikeal, Misty, Kelsey, and Jen were phenomenal!!! They were all sweet, helpful, and personable, which is something that is too often missed with businesses these days. The GM and owner were not only present, but also serving the clients and both came to talk to me individually and ensured everything was going well!

         Second, the food and the beer they had on tap were excellent!! I requested recommendations from the employees and each item was great; (philly fries, fish and chips, Stone IPA and Raj)!!!! 

          I will be traveling to downtown Phoenix frequently for business and they have earned a loyal customer each and every time I return! 

P.S. They also have free wifi! 

Thanks again, Kettle Black!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, good drinks, clean and inviting atmosphere. 

Soft pretzel w/cheese and mustard was very good. Above average for bar food appetizer. Crab cake was light, fresh and good portioned.

My husband had the fish & chips and the fish was one huge fillet, lightly battered, fresh and flakey. But the house made tarter sauce was the belle of this ball. It was tangy but sweet, and hit all the right notes with the fresh fried fish.

I had the chicken caprese sandwich and side house salad. Portions were good and while the salad was nothing to write home about, the seasoned chicken, fresh mozzarella, and ripe tomato on the sandwich made up for it. Yum yum yum!

Our server received a nice big tip for constant (but not overly) attentive service and regularly refilled mimosas.

When visiting downtown Phoenix make this a stop on your agenda."}
{"text":"Service- not attentive and forgot orders 
Food- mediocre plenty of other places downtown that offer more Of a selection and tastier. If you're just going for beers n chit chat it's fine ."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Had one drink and checked out! The guy bartender must be new cause not even the server could get his attention. She told us \"he must be really concentrating\"."}
{"text":"Looking for something new? Then this your spot! Start off with priorities staff is great and attentive! Thank you Cassie! Our party was huge and poor thing took it like a champ running circles as well ass serving a full house! 
Food was amazing everything we tried to sample the menu was a hit! From crab cakes, battered chicken strips which were one of my faves where just the right of tempura like batter meats tender white chicken breast with a yummy dipping sauce! Should I go on? Ok the Rueben! How bout the best thing between two slices of marble rye since I don't know when!!! 
So in a nutshell Kettle Black is a new presence with great energy, music, food and drinks! 
I wanna be Norm from Cheers here!"}
{"text":"Food and service were fantastic!  I mean it's a pub/bar but one of the ladies I was with made a face normally seen in a much more private setting with the first bite of her burger."}
{"text":"Burger was great.
Bartender offered a good scotch recommendation.
Great service.
Definitely go back."}
{"text":"Me and gf came here from Southern California. The waiter wasn't attentive, not pay attention whenever we needed to... we are tourists, asking for taking picture all of us but he denied to do so also  :(
Let's talk about food we ordered... fish & chips; chips were old and saggy. 
Steak salad was good enough. 
Over all we decided to rate 1 stars... to be honest, wanted to rate half star."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. Great reviews and heard good stuff from friends but when we went we were literally told \"we are not making that right now\" when we tried ordering craft drinks on a Friday night at 11:30pm.  So just FYI that when bartenders deem themselves \"to busy\" only beer and wine will be served. I will try to go back during the day maybe than service will be better."}
{"text":"AMAZiNG fish and chips. Great liquor selection. Corned beef was delicious like bacon. Keep it up and you'll be here a long time"}
{"text":"Our waitress was great! Very attentive and helpful. Pretzel is delicious. I enjoyed my chicken sandwich but some friends didnt love their food. Overall a good place."}
{"text":"The bacon onion burger was great. Truly a phenomenal burger masterpiece. Service was mediocre, no fresh drinks and waited way to long for checks."}
{"text":"Tom (i think he is the owner) was amazing. We came in while in town on a business trip. He accommodated our party even without a reservation. The food was good, the drinks were good,  and the service was great....my only complaint was that the food took an hour to come out but the quality made up for it.  We had the crab cakes,  ahi tuna salad, mac and cheese and it was all excellent."}
{"text":"Great! We had such a wonderful experience! Had several different people checking on our table and we never needed anything! Our server,  Misty,  was great. She could recommend beer that was similar to the one we wanted but they were out.  It's not easy for us to go out and have a good experience in a restaurant,  as there are so many with crappy service and we are ex-restaurant people, but tonight was exceptional! Food was great too!"}
{"text":"Great service from Kelsey, she rocks! And the food, ambiance was great also, had the chicken kabob and the salmon both great!"}
{"text":"Stopped on a recent Sunday and was definitely impressed by the place.  Food was very good, my companion was pleased and the only suggestions that I'd have is perhaps for a bit broader beer selection.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Exemplary staff and great food make this a must visit spot. I was in town for a conference and ate two dinners here, one solo and one with a group of 8. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Great atmosphere. A little noisy, but nothing beyond a normal pub with people. Definitely consider the pecan crusted chicken with mango mustard sauce, so good. One of my colleagues had the reuben and said it was very good. I had the fish and chips one night, fries were a little soggy for my taste, but still tasted good. Overall, great spot."}
{"text":"What a treat!! The atmosphere was fun and the food and service were great. Recommend the 1st Street burger, outstanding! But the bread pudding is to die for. Michael, our server did not stear us wrong. We will be back."}
{"text":"Cool environment.  Service at the bar is absolutely terrible.  Painfully slow and completely indifferent.    Food was average.  Nothing terribly exciting about the menu."}
{"text":"Food was good but not great. Environment was clean, server was pelit and attentive. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We eat downtown very often and this is one of our favorite restaurants. The portion sizes are perfect for the price. The food is always prepared perfectly and we've never been made to wait too long. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive to the customers. You have to try the bread pudding!"}
{"text":"Sexy, young, and downtown!  I would give this place a six-star rating if I could; alas, five will have to due.  The bartenders are the friendliest and cutest guys downtown.  Ask for Harry, he'll take great care of you, with a nice smile.  As for the food: amazing!  The mussels are delectable and the spicy chicken sandwich (pictured here with a house salad) is so tasty!  The best part (besides the friendly bartenders and staff) is the environment with the cool tunes.  You'll leave agreeing the music is en-point: Fugees, OutKast, Kid Cudi!  

I can't get enough!  If you're dropping by my hood (#DTPHX); stop by The Kettle Black."}
{"text":"Please try the crab cakes.  The service is great.  They treat you like old friends.  I will be back for my next concert pre-party"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Clams were some of the best I've ever had, we ordered another."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place to open up and, sadly, I've only been able to go once so far. I was going to wait to write a review until I got to go again and watch some live music...but I don't know when that will happen, and I already know I'll enjoy myself five stars' worth, anyway. So, why wait?

I made it on one of the soft opening nights (along with everyone else and their mothers), and it was definitely not lacking for patrons. Luckily enough, my friend and I were just early enough that we caught one of the bench booths by the door, but I don't think we would have found a seat much farther in (good for them!).

The staff had to have been pretty ragged from the full Friday before, all day Saturday, and anticipating all day Sunday...but our server was friendly as ever and just a cool chick. You know...like when you're exhausted from busting your ass, but you're appreciative of all of the people there...that's how it felt to me.

I ordered a Smithwick's and the Southwest Chicken Wrap (my favorite at TF). The waitress actually thought I had said Blackened Chicken, so that's what I received...but I attributed it to my lack of a booming voice and viewed it as a chance to try something I might not have noticed otherwise, so I kept the Blackened Chicken sandwich and...oh my, was that serendipitous. The chicken breast was juicy and flavorful, the avocado was...avocado (yum), and the ciabatta was buttery and squishy and just pretty much perfect. I found a secondary favorite to switch off with the Southwest Chicken Wrap.

The waitress took great care of us, and every staff member/owner that I happened into was friendly and wonderful, but I expected no less in that arena.

If I get to move closer to the area, this is going to be my go-to spot, hands down, and I will happily spread the word. I love these people.

Oh and the look of the place is just beautiful...I will make it a goal to sit and enjoy every area of the joint at some point, including the adorable window seats looking out on the sidewalk. I don't know if there's a proper \"architectural\" term for those, lol...I'm sure someone on this site will be able to put me in my place in no time. :)"}
{"text":"Highly recommend 
Definitely a place to visit. Food drinks and service incredible. Steve, at the bar, is incredibly knowledgeable and very friendly. True Irish Pub with great service great prices and incredible flare...
A True visit to not regret."}
{"text":"With a nice hip hop vibe and a modern look, this little pub is certainly a great place to spend your time. The drinks are incredibly good, I'd recommend \"Dear Prudence\", and the food!! Especially the fish and chips are delicious as well as memorable! The staff is welcoming, quick, and cheery, and the boss, Jay, is so enchanting! You'll absolutely feel comfortable as well as at home in a place like this! I'll definitely be coming back here soon"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon.  Excellent food.  Excellent service   Excellent music. Excellent ambiance. I wish I had taken a photo of  (the owner) Tommy's Nana's bread pudding before the plate was scraped clean.  Tommy works and chats with the customers.  If you have a concern he will make it right and then some.  We'll be back, soon."}
{"text":"Billy the bartender is awesome! Great service and knowledgable. If you happen to come on a night they have the Guinness French onion soup, it is a must have. I come here al the time and it's always a good time."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. Everything I have ordered has been delicious. The staff are all friendly and professional. This is one of the better places to grab a quick bite downtown. 

Five stars for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in before the symphony. Close by friendly atmosphere. Chicken wings were delicious.  Fish and chips classic and tasty. The steak salad was pretty good the flat iron steak was cooked to a nice medium/rare  a lot of lettuce and ratio of corn and roasted red peppers were good. Our server was friendly and gave me some insight to craft beers. Had me taste a couple to get an idea of what I was looking for.  The bread pudding was great and our.waitress made a fresh pot of java to make it complete. Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch a couple of weeks back with a friend from work. Really liked the place. I had the hamburger and it was really tasty. The fries were home cut which are even better. My friend had the chicken sandwich with a side salad and really enjoyed her meal. Service was really friendly and the prices were reasonable to me."}
{"text":"Steak was awesome and the service was great. It was a pleasant experience. Steve is a great guy and we are very happy with the way he has served us."}
{"text":"My husband and I and good friends from OC visited Scottsdale again in January for the many car auctions. Our 2 OC friends treated us for dinner at The Kettle Black one night. It was their first time there and they were as surprised as we were at the variety and the quality. It is much more than a pub. Good job Jason and great to see you and that The Kettle Black is thriving."}
{"text":"Yowza!!  Great job with this joint. Atmosphere top notch. Service superb. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We went in first the waitress got my drink wrong then I ordered  I got the crab cakes, husband ordered a sandwich. I found a long thick hair in my crab cakes. My husband had only 1/2 of his sandwich and after seeing that lost his appetite. I was not going to eat my crab cakes.  The waitress argued that my husband had eaten all of his sandwich. Why should we pay for food that has hair in it.  Clearly they showed that hygiene is not a factor in the kitchen how could he have finished.  I am a restaurant owner, if this had happened in my kitchen someone would have been fired and to be argued with is ridiculous. I have not ever not tipped but because we were argued with yeah I'm sorry but......"}
{"text":"The food was amazing ! What is even more refreshing was the wonderful service from our waitress Kelsey ! She is a pro and is an asset to The Kettle Black . Knowledgable about drinks and menus . I love when the recommendations are on point. Kelsey was polite and genuine she definitely represents the brand well. Our entire group was raving about the food and for the first time in a while the service too! We will be back thanks again !"}
{"text":"I want to start out by saying that when I heard about this #pub opening I was so excited to try it. When I finally stumbled in this weekend I was thrown off immediately when I saw the menu. While the new decor reminds you of a minimalist twenty first century mod pub... there is absolutely no cohesive pub theme on the menu. 

I noticed steak, fish and chips and Guinness however none of these were highlighted, they have them near the bottom. This American #pub offers a variety of starters, salads, burgers and entrees however, vegetarians beware...  you will probably only be able to choose between fries or a pretzel. 

I chose the blackened chicken sandwich which had great flavor between the chicken and avacado. It was delicious however it cost around $13 for the sandwich and a small portion of fries. Wasn't worth going back just for the food in my opinion.... 

In addition to southwestern American menu choices mixed with English pub faves like fish and chips... The service was spotty. I had to remind the server what I ate in a party of four and then correct her when she confused the items on our checks. After pointing out the error the server gave an excuse as to it being a whole new systen.... unless the computer is randomly separating checks that is a human error which would have been okay with a simple acknowledgment rather than blaming the establishment. 

There were no drink specials nor drink menu in this #pub.  Since this is a soft opening I suggest putting more emphasis on the #pub atmosphere. They have the kitchen part down. In addition, offer a vegetarian entree for the animal lovers out there! They are people too.. 

Thanks Kettle Black. I hope the smell of new wood wears off soon. I felt like I was in the lumber section of home depot."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Great beer selection and hospitable wait staff. They took a reservation 30-minutes out for 11-people on a Final-Four & opening day (baseball)! Very nice of them to accomidate. The food was good. No complaints by anyone at the table. Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"Great new spot downtown. Pretty darn good fish&chips!"}
{"text":"While on a business trip, we decided to try out this place since it was close to our hotel and had generally positive Yelp reviews. While the atmosphere was interesting, the food was pretty average for the price (at our table we had the 1st Street Burger, the Reuben, the Corned Beef and Cabbage, the Soup of the Day, the Ballpark Pretzel, and the Chicken Wings). For what you get, I definitely feel that the portions should be larger and the prices lower."}
{"text":"I had the burger last night, a couple hours after leaving I became violently ill. I'm assuming the meat was the cause. It could have been a coincidence, who knows, but I wanted to let everyone know, has anyone else had a similar experience? It was very traumatic, I will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"I just wanted to provide a suggestion. We really wanted to go here but couldn't find parking at all and we stopped searching after 15 minutes. There wasn't any information on here nor their website. I think that would be extremely helpful. Especially since this restaurant is in the heart of downtown and there are frequent events. We'll give it a go another time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite additions to downtown!  From the drinks to the food to the service, everything is exceptional. It's a great place to watch some sports with plenty of televisions. I highly recommend the burgers, fish & chips and the pretzel. The mustard served with the pretzel is outstanding!  

The menu is pleasantly simple and I haven't had a disappointing dish. Prices are reasonable on food and drinks. 

Service has always been amazing here. Everyone makes you feel welcome and makes sure you're enjoying everything. 

If you like a chill pub in a relaxing atmosphere with good food and drinks, definitely head to The Kettle Black!"}
{"text":"Husband and I were looking for a sports bar to watch football before flying out of Phx. Came across this place and could not have been happier. Unassuming from the exterior but so warm friendly and inviting once through the doors. Ordered the Bavarian pretzel DELICIOUS  follow by the Bacon onion burger which was equally amazing! Plenty of great beers on tap and of course football all around. The best part of our visit was Gill the bartender. Amazing service super friendly ridiculously funny and knowledgeable of the beers on tap. Cocktails are available too but we were in a brew mood this day. Definitely make a stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"My friend arrived before I, and specifically asked what was on draft. The bar tender pointed at the chalkboard list. The first thing he ordered was out of stock. He then ordered a second choice, which was on the list. The bartender brought him a bottled beer. I then arrive and am quickly greeted by the bartender, my first question is \"What do you have on draft?\" I was pointed to the chalkboard, but my friend forwarns me that not all are draft. I see a beer I am interested and ask if it is on draft, and am told no it's a can. I realize this bartender is not going to put any effort into helping me find a draft. So then I peak around the post that the chalkboard is on and see that Magner's is on draft and just order that. He then shows up with a can of the first beer I asked about. I don't think we could have been any more obvious that we were interested in a draft beer. I then tell him I ordered Magner's, which he quickly pours, as at this point I'm annoyed that he isn't listening and was going to cancel my order all together. Additionally the beer that was out of stock remained on the chalkboard, and was never erased for other to order and be disappointed.
In the mean time our third friend is arriving, I meet her outside and tell her we will chug our beers and be out in a minute that this place is terrible and we are going somewhere else. We then get the bill $15 total, $8 for a bottled beer (what really $8 for a bottled beer!!!) and $7 for a Magner's (not as steep for the product, at least a draft beer). I will never go back, horrible service.h"}
{"text":"Sorry Kettle Black.  You won't ever see me again.  

An \"Irish Pub\" that offers Philly Cheese Steak?  Didn't want to even try it.  

My friend ordered a Rueben Sandwich would have sent any true Jew running into the streets screaming.  Gordon Ramsey, where are you when we need you?   Want a really good Rueben?  You can find it in the most unimaginable and unlikely place in town - Village Inn.  A great Rueben sandwich.

I ordered fish and chips.  Dreadful.   At least it was cod.  The lump of fish  should have been sliced thin before battering and frying.  The batter did not stick to the fish and it was a chore just to try to get it into my mouth without it falling off my fork.  I think this is also an indication that the frying oil was not being hot enough.  The fries were good though after being doused with salt and malt vinegar.

One of our group ordered Crab Cakes and loved them.  OK, one brownie point.

Another ordered the Ahi Tuna salad.  It seemed OK but was nothing special and could have been duplicated in over 100 Phoenix eateries.

Did they offer a large selection of craft beers?  Yes, but after the mediocre food who cares?  Not me."}
{"text":"Well stocked bar, great food. I really like their soft pretzel! Lot's of TVs, friendly staff. Everything I want in a bar"}
{"text":"PHENOMENAL!!!! The food was awesome! Service was great too. 

Buffalo chicken fries were amazing!"}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday night craving a steak and ordered the peppercorn steak which came with seasonal vegetables (garlic green bean) and fries for $21. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and was nice and juicy. The sides were fantastic as well. Considering I wasn't at all hungry to begin with, the meal was impressive. Would definitely come back to try some drinks and more food."}
{"text":"I met my girlfriend here for lunch a couple weeks ago and I was blown away! They get sort of busy for lunch, but not nearly as busy as they should be for the food they're slinging. My friend had been there once before, ordered the steak salad, loved it, and ordered it again when we went. I dipped my pinkie in her dressing and it was divine - she was done when I did that.

I ordered the ahi tuna salad. There are few restaurant salads that impress me - particularly at a self-proclaimed \"pub,\" but this one definitely did! It was so delicious, and, long story short, I could eat it all day, every day. I tend to order the same thing when I find something as delicious as that salad, but I hope I can convince myself to branch out the next time we go there for lunch."}
{"text":"Super yummy food! The burgers were flavorful and fries were fresh tasting. After trying to go to a nearby restaurant and not wanting to wait an hour our group of six stopped in and was easily seated . The waitress was happy to accommodate our requests and was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"My server, Mikeal, was spot on with his recommendations for both drink and food. The signature burger, the First Street, was prepared correctly and was very satisfying. Venue is a bit touristy for my taste but understandable given its location."}
{"text":"I live downtown and always walk by here and we finally stopped in. Such great service by Mikeal. We got the Philly cheesesteak fries to start which were unbelievably good. I had the California club and my friend had the fish and chips. Get it all! Great atmosphere, definitely coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Didn't thrill me, sadly. Atmosphere was a little on the generic side. We wandered in (there's no hostess stand so we shrugged and seated ourselves) and it took a few minutes to get acknowledged so that was a little annoying. Our server was good though, friendly and attentive.

The mussels were bland and the beer selection our server listed off was kinda boring. :\ I do want to come back and try their fish and chips sometime though."}
{"text":"The service is excellent. Food is awesome and fresh. The beer selection is fantastic. Try the mussels as they are different and tasty. Best fish and chips around."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! My fiancé and I tried to appetizers for dinner which were phenomenal. I could only finish half. I asked for a box and they had to go ask the restaurant next door for a box because they'd run out. Awkward! The only reason they're not a 5 star is because we sat at the bar next to where the waitresses ask for drinks. There was an angry blonde waitress every time we turned around complaining about how busy she was and how mad she was. That was so unprofessional."}
{"text":"Well they don't keep the beers in stock, and they seem to be understaffed. Enjoyed my food , but beer selection and service a disappointment"}
{"text":"Great cocktails and awesome food ! Crab cakes at midnight far exceeded my expectations !
Misty and Harrison, y'all rock !"}
{"text":"So cool- nice place to hang out and drinking beer! Delicious foods and beer - you cannot miss it ! We fall in love when we stepped into the place. Last couple of months are so good - fresh beers and good foods. Last three times, beers are not available and quality of food are going down. So salty you cannot eat. We decided to drink beers but no food because it is cool place to hang out and we love the bartender Steven. After going through the other pubs, I feel tHt kettle pus is a way better than other . 
I am updating my review after four times I went after initial review. It is so hard to park and during four times of visits, they told me Heineken was out and my friend beer was out too. They only have less than 6 draft beers and every time we went they are out. We went early and also late so it is not acceptable as a downtown bar their main business is selling beers. No more this place for beer. Sorry four times of out of beers don't give them any excuse."}
{"text":"Visiting friends in Phoenix from California and I can definitely say I'll be coming back on my future trips. Everything is a 10 from the solid drink list to the ambiance to the food etc etc...Our favorite part of the whole dining experience was our server Jason K! He was super knowledgeable on all of the food items and drinks and made us feel so welcomed! Thank you Jason! We'll see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Terrific service.  Veteran run business.  Service best I've seen.  Eat and drink local and stop in here.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The kabob chicken was tender and vegetables were very fresh. Pleasantly surprised by the quality of food."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!! After a disappointing experience at the bites and brews festival we found this little gem. The food was outstanding. The Buffalo chips had the perfect blend of heat and blue cheese. The Philly chips that my girl friend had was outstanding as well. What topped it off for us was our server Kelsey, she was fun, personable and attentive. Definitely a must for anyone that is headed downtown."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was exceptional. A really cool find. Hip hop magical pub, nothing like it."}
{"text":"I really have enjoyed this place several times. There is a great beer selection and a great whiskey selection. The menu has a very good selection for foodies. But I do miss the battered chicken. It was awesome. Very good service from the staff. The truffle fries are great also. My friend that came on our last trip says the chicken club is great. I recommend a trip."}
{"text":"It's amazing how fast we were served and got our meal. Between the awesome fish and chips and the pub atmosphere i could have sworn we were in Great Britain or Ireland. Can't say enough good things about this place"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good beer and whiskey, really good food, and the owner is the nicest guy I've met in Phoenix. I tried out this place based on previous reviews and since it's right next to my hotel. Great choice, I'll be back"}
{"text":"Limited beer selection but the food was good. A good place for a quick meal ahead of a game or concert. First time we sat at the bar and service was quicker than the secretary be time when we sat at the center shared high tables."}
{"text":"We went for lunch today, when downtown Phoenix was pretty much empty. Happened upon this place, and wow! The Philly cheesesteak fries are off the hook! Best fries I've ever had. Waiters were attentive but not over-bearing. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Random find using Yelp. This place is amazing!  Highly, highly recommend going if you're in Phoenix. Small place but huge attention to their environment and product. The waitress was extremely helpful in giving recommendations. We took her recommendations and weren't disappointed. The Buffalo Chicken Fries may be the best conglomerate of ingredients I've had for fries and the wings are better than any chain restaurant you'll spend your money at. Definitely a place where you have to go when in town."}
{"text":"I hope I caught them on a bad day. Arrived at 12:45 at the end of their lunch rush. Waited about 10 minutes for a table. No problem. By the time we were seated five minutes, empty tables were all around and they never filled up again while we were there. That is to be expected for the time of day. What wasn't expected was the scattered service. I'm not sure if they were understaffed or undermanaged, but the wait staff was struggling to get things together. A table near us waited quite awhile to get an order in. Our food took about 25 minutes. When ordering a second beer as the food arrived, it sat at the bar and never arrived at our table. The waiter seemed surprised when I asked him to take it off of the bill. He did the right thing by taking the other beer off as well. The atmosphere and food were great. I'd try the place again because I'm hoping this was a one-time problem with the wait staff."}
{"text":"What can I say about the Kettle Black?  Nice prompt and friendly service .  Cold beer. Can't review the food as we have not eaten yet.  Low key atmosphere. Good hangout after work."}
{"text":"Cool vibe, excellent music choice playing at perfect volume (clearly audible without hindering conversation) and great food. Perfectly reasonable prices, too. Nice to have a great place like this so close to the convention center."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, visiting my daughter at ASU. Service and food excellent, great Irish pub atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hands down the best service ever! Harrison may be one of the most positive and happy people I've ever met. It's rare to find good drinks, food, and the passion that this place has! Must try!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was unbelievable. Plus in-house aged bourbon is worth paying so much more. Can't say enough for this place!!!! So good."}
{"text":"The fish and chips is far and away my favorite dish here. The burger is a solid choice, and the pork belly sliders are perfect both in their honey glaze, their fresh crunchy coleslaw and the crisp-yet- 
chewiness of the pork belly.  The french fries are thin, and not super crisp but they're seasoned perfectly and I usually demolish them first off my plate. 

They offer a selection of craft brews in addition to standard fare at the bar.

Inside it's cozy like an old British pub. There are several big tables for groups, and the place is usually quite full. Yet somehow it never feels chaotic, nor insanely crowded. It seems to me the crowds here tend to be older, in the 30s-40s-50s bracket. It feels laid back. 

The staff are kind, attentive but they leave you alone to enjoy yourself too.

I am from out of town, and I probably end up here every other visit. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is great! Little place looks like a regular bar but the food is great! Had the mussels and the braised roast and they were both super delicious! Bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable. We will for sure go there again!"}
{"text":"Great bar with excellent food, just in town for a few days and would highly recommend stopping here !"}
{"text":"Went to dinner here with some business associates on a Tuesday evening and we were all very happy with the choice.

I had the scallops, which were fantastic. Normally I would not order seafood in a Phoenix pub, but the dish was really good.  My associates both had burgers (one bean) and both said their burgers were great.

Service was very good, though I would note it was not busy.  Was impressed how the food was delivered by three people who each set the plates down.  I don't know if that is usual or not, but it felt upscale.  Pretty good beer selection, including local beers, which everyone was happy with."}
{"text":"Friday night post event find- right across from hannys.

Decorated like a dark \"gastropub\" this spot has a little patio area with a bar & booths inside.

The prices are reasonable for wine all under $9.  I also try the kebobs which are homemade yummy goodness.  Served over green beans the chicken kebobs also have onions, peppers, mushrooms, and tomatoes.  This dish is served with a corn salsa.  I would make this at home!  The food was served hot but I would have liked a minute or two more on the green beans.  Most of the chicken had a nice light char.

Our server Karen was very nice & helpful without being overbearing!  This is a gem in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Uninspired gastropub food in fresh from the catalog \"authentic\" pub space. The 1st street burger was the least flavorful hamburger I've yet had in a restaurant containing many differing textures but remarkable only for its lack of flavor. The food reminded me most of the grub one would get at a casino diner at 3 AM: The Kettle Black is better than going hungry but only just."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot downtown to grab one; and pretty good on weekend too as long as one's there early.
Music can get awful; actually downright stomach turning later, particularly if dj there.
ghetto hippidy hoppitidy went out with the hula hoop, btw."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Reuben critic and this Reuben is spot on! Paired with fresh, tossed, greens and their house citrus vinegarette you can't go wrong! Aaahhmmazing! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were passing through Phoenix, where my sister lives and tried this place. I really really wanted to like it. We had to pay for parking $12. Since it seemed all the street parking at that time of day is for loading only. When we finally get there, the restaurant is almost empty with 3 other tables waiting for their food. We order two beers. They were literally overflowing as they were brought to the table. When they were sat down there was beer everywhere. They didn't even bother to clean it up. The food we ordered took 40
minutes. We asked for a coke, no ice, and it was brought with ice after we reminded the waiter twice for the drink. The food had obviously been sitting for a while as it was cold. It shouldn't have taken that long. It was a California club and fish and chips. I wouldn't return. Food was good. But it doesn't out weigh the bad service."}
{"text":"After an espically long day, Traveling  via Las Vegas. This place was an excellent find. The food selection was outstanding. We opted for crab cakes and pork belly sliders, delicious. It was a very peaceful comfortable pub. Nice choice of beers,good service and excellent hours for weary travellers. Open till 2 am Sunday. We got there at around 1030 pm. Great service."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place.  Cool atmosphere and food was amazing.  Very friendly staff!  Our meal took a little long to come out. We didn't notice the wait, but were comped a few drinks.  Will defiantly be returning!"}
{"text":"Was here over the weekend with a large party for my birthday. This place was one of the few places that could accommodate our group size and they were incredibly amazing. Great selection of food and drinks. I had their onion burger which was so tasty. Our server was on point. I really enjoyed our time here and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food with fun atmosphere. Need to get there early as it gets crowded fast. I sat at the bar as there was no table space but the bartenders were friendly. I ordered the turkey burger and my friend had the fish and chips. We both enjoyed our food and the salads were great.  They have a huge variety of beers on tap. I recommend this place but it's loud so not  for a quiet night but a fun one!"}
{"text":"1st Street burger was deliciousness the meat was well seasoned and the bun was just a bonus! Handout fries - deliciousness my husband enjoyed his chicken sandwich! This place was inexpensive and delicious! Would definitely return! Thomas the bartender pours awesome drinks!"}
{"text":"Beer glasses were warm like just pulled out of dishwasher. Food took forever to get here. Limp fries. Not very big selection of drinks.... waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Good vibe, food was on point, I'd come back. I got the Fish 'n' Chips per the waiters recommendation"}
{"text":"This place has a great burger and the booze selection is great. Definitely a good place to enjoy a meal if you're visiting from out of town or wanna watch a game."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere once inside. You will be pleasantly surprised and rewarded. The Bar selection is framed by picture like frames of various shapes and sizes. The picture effect separates a serious display of whisky,Rye and bourbon 
Ahi salad was perfect size,great flavor and crunch all topped with comfortable and professional service."}
{"text":"Searching for GF food options late on Friday after an evening Dbacks game is tricker than one would hope in a metropolis like Phoenix. Thankfully, Kettle Black popped up with the best Yelp! reviews around. After perusing the menu online, I gave them a quick ring to confirm that their kitchen was open late. From the moment we arrived to the time we left, we were treated as true guests. Despite walking in with six and the place being quite full, they were able to seat us quickly in a corner booth. The menu offerings are an inspired step-up from your typical pub-grub with reimagined flavors and delicious sides which really hit the spot! Don't miss their full bar and impressive draft selections. We're already looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, fresh salad and crisp white wine served up with friendly service. Inside I felt like I was back in England with the dark, country pub feel. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great Fuckin service! Its the little things that make a place successful and thia place does it. Great cocktails and bombass wings. the kicker is that has excellent atmosphere, it really captures Arizona culture. Fuck hard rock cafe and go to this place"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back to this pub! Delicious food, great service,  authentic irish pub feel! Kind of pricey but understandable for the delicious and high quality food. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I had the California club sandwich. The bread had been pan fried with butter. When I was eating the sandwich, it was pretty greasy and I was constantly wiping my hands on my napkin. I was offered a choice of a side of either cole slaw or french fries. I had the cole slaw and it was good. The California club sandwich came with lettuce, bacon, avocado, and chicken (besides the bread).

I also had the fish and chips. The chips are actually french fries. I didn't think the french fries were quite as good as some others that I have had before. The fish was pretty greasy, but the coating was light, which I liked. The tartar sauce was good too.  The fish was just one giant piece - it was well cooked but kind of strange to get one big piece instead of a few smaller ones.  Also there were no crispy bits of batter.

There was live entertainment, where a person played the guitar, which made the atmosphere quite loud, so it was difficult to talk with my other dinner companion. I would usually pass on the live entertainment but that's personal preference.  The waiter reminded me of a pirate."}
{"text":"Really great pub style! Waiter kept sitting next to me repeatedly...like 6 times. But I enjoyed the place and food very much"}
{"text":"Great service , awesome beer and best of delicious food. I was lucky enough to come in during the North Mountain beer and food pairing. The steak with the scotch ale sauce was spectacular!!!"}
{"text":"Imagine sitting at a bar, asking for a menu and being refused a menu. Then asking for a beer and receiving a warm beer. Imagine paying for your warm beer then being told to leave because you want a cup of water. That was my second experience at Kettle Black on March 28th. Steve was the bartender. He actually refused to bring me water. How would you respond, what would you do? I told him I was going to write a review then he changed his mind and he brought me water in a to go cup. It was the only thing he did right. My first experience at Kettle Black in October I ordered a burger, it came with a twist tie wire in the burger. If you like the chance of death by twist tie wire then this is the place for you. I imagine you can find 10 to 20 other great places to drink within 3 blocks of this place. I suggest the Copper Blues, Hanny's or the Nook."}
{"text":"Stopped in to check out this place as it was highly rated. It didn't disappoint. Hipster crowd, cool pub atmosphere. Service was great. Ordered the crab cakes! Yum! Next time I'll order the fish and chips, looked amazing...apparently they use a tempura batter!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this joint for some time. Three of us hit up the place before a Diamondbacks game and the place was pretty dead. but that did not stop
Us from receiving great service and great food. 

My friends both had wings that they said were very good. The hot sauce appeared to be homemade and was delicious. 

I ordered the chicken wrap and was not disappointed. They use this jalapeño mayo sauce that is fabulous.  

Only downside was the server forgot to add my friends soup to the order so it never came."}
{"text":"Went to the kettle black kitchen twice in one day. It was very good and close to my hotel. Good atmosphere and great bartenders."}
{"text":"I rely wanted to like this place I live the atmosphere I guess that where it stops the beer was room temp at best I want a nice cold beer so that was disappointing corn beef and cabbage was pretty dame good mash potatoes were not hard and just did not that good wife had the burger she said it was OK I tried it I think it was the bun it was dried out maybe to our the fries where soggy not crispy the server was friendly but a little slow"}
{"text":"I have been here about 3-4 times hoping for a better experience but I keep coming up short. It's just not that great the food is ok the atmosphere is great and so is the service. 

We ordered Fish Sandwhich and french fries and both were really salty. 

My GF ordered Buffalo Chicken and it ended up making her sick once. The Indian fries is a really poor attempt and fusing two styles of food."}
{"text":"This is the spot in downtown Phoenix. Don't even waste your time going to the Tilted Kilt. If you want great food and service, then head here. Unfortunately, my friends and I wasted our time and then found out about this place. 

The kitchen is open late, which made our decision a lot easier. We just left Dodgers Stadium East, AKA Chase Field looking for some places to hit up. There are not many places around like Tempe but some cool spots. 

There are about 10 different beers on the rotation. I went with a local microbrew. I had to order the pork belly sliders. Oh yeah, delicious! I couldn't say no to the mac and cheese with pork belly either. My friends and I just shared it. 

Cool place to hang on a weekday. Walking distance to the courtyard Marriott and residence inn. Not sure how it is during the weekends. Service was great. Plenty of booths and tables. Give them a try. Happy eating/drinking!"}
{"text":"Wandered in on a Saturday afternoon after a downtown event & found this pretty little gem. Still smells new aka paint etc. Cute patio that was already full. The place was filling up quickly for a Saturday early evening 4:30p.m. (great sign). The bartenders were so helpful & quick. We got the pretzel for a snack & it was delish. Loved the cheese sauce & mustard. I really love me a good mustard so this was great to me. The pretzel was really good all by itself. Soft, warm & fluffy on the inside with a slight chew on the outside. Just like a pretzel should be. Definitely not a reheat. I'm so going to have to go back & try the steak salad & fish & chips. They were ordered on either side of me while sitting at the bar. They looked really good too. Maybe this will be a 5 star review after I try more than a delish pretzel. To quote Arnold \"I'll be back!\"."}
{"text":"Very nice staff however the drinks and food that i had were not that great....I had the worst mojito ever, just tasted bland. The chicken wings were not seasoned, bland without the sauce...very dissatisfied after reading the reviews claiming that it was great. I did not complain but will not return!"}
{"text":"My wife and I loved this place - excellent food, wonderful service, and funky atmosphere.  Very close to Talking Stick, Comerica Theater, etc.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We got in late and stumbled across this place.  It was great.  The bartender was friendly and easy to work with.  Food was really good.  We got burgers, wraps and a Caesar salad with grilled chicken.  Would I go back .... yes!"}
{"text":"In town for a workshop and the reviews lured us in! (Well, that and the thought of Irish fare and possible awesome local brews to taste!) each of us ended up ordering the fish n chips, after much contemplation. This was an excellent choice !the crisp batter was delectable, French fries were delicious and there was an okay slaw on the side. I ended up ordering a Stone IPA, even though it is not local, it's a well know craft from one state west. We saw other plates come out, burgers look like a great choice and we also witnessed the \"pretzel\"- wishing I had tried that. It's a casual atmosphere, open to the outdoors (you can eat outside too). Very welcoming staff, including a manager or owner(?) who stopped by to ask about our experience. It's a must stop if you're in the downtown area , out for a b-ball game, etc. Fresh, delicious, cozy."}
{"text":"Great urban atmosphere with a number of nice craft beer selections among porters, hefs, and ipas."}
{"text":"Great service and drinks were on point. Bartenders had personality too! Service was quick and efficient when we sat down. Thumbs up guys!"}
{"text":"Really giving 3.5 stars. We came in for dinner before a concert on 6/28/17. Service was a bit slow but friendly. I had the scallops which were delicious, and my husband had the fish and chips with garlic fries which was pretty good. The fries were very limp and soggy but the flavor was good. Decent beer selection, love the ambience. We would return."}
{"text":"Came upon this place while walking to another restaurant. Saw a small place and it said \"kitchen and pub\" and we thought oh maybe this is a hidden hole. So we decided to check it out. Soooooooo glad we did. It's far from a hole. Loved the atmosphere, music, service and the food was AMAZING. So glad we stopped on our walk to the other place."}
{"text":"This place was new to me and i went because of Yelp reviews.  The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was comfortable.  It is dim on the inside and booth tables are limited due to the width of the room.  

food is good. 

Apps was philly steak fries, hummas and wings.  The only one i didnt like was the fries. The home made fries themselves was aweaome but the toppings were greasey.  The wings were on the smaller side but still had a great flavor.  Hummas was my favorite.

 Dinner was fish/chips, burger, steak salad, corned beef/cabbage & vodka pasta. Everything was great except the vodka pasta.  Tasted like rague sauce with pasta.  The corned beef/cabbage was devine as the corned beef was think cut and moist. So good!  The steak salad had great flavors and the dressing was the bomb.  I suggest to get it on the side. 

Dessert was bread pudding and that is because they had nothing else. It was still really good.

Drinks was your tipical bar though they were sub par on cocktails. I liked that they muttled fresh fruit/veggies but not for all their drinks. There was one drink they made i really liked but that is because i had the alter it a little."}
{"text":"Interesting looking bar.  It has that Irish pub feel with the wood dividers and wooden bar. Looks of liquor options and a board naming the craft beers.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Fast service and a great southwest chicken wrap. It was busy with conference goers and business people, but I managed to snag a spot to enjoy my time there. Cool decor, clean restrooms. Win win"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place, while in downtown phoenix turned it out it was their soft opening. It's just so happened to be the weekend of the National championship. Great weekend to open. I asked for an old fashion and then bald headed bearded man didn't even have a muddler but he still made it happen. Best of luck it looks like this place will be a good hangout with friends"}
{"text":"It's hard to give a bad rating on alcohol. My friend and I only stayed for one drink. The bartender was moving extremely fast and it affected his customer service. It got to the point where he was all over the place and he accidentally spilled a drink on my friend. Yikes. If you do come here, the Maui Brewing coconut beer is delicious!"}
{"text":"They were so nice!! This place is the best! I went before my Kill the Noise party to grab a beer! I will definitely be back for the food it looks great!! The staff is great! Customer service is amazing here!! They treat customers as part of the family!"}
{"text":"We took a small group here for dinner and really enjoyed the ambiance, the food selection, and the friendly and attentive serving staff. Would definitely come here again. The black bean burger was great!"}
{"text":"Just let me start by saying this. Everything I like about about pub and tavern food was served up perfectly here. While traveling, I ventured out to this place on my second to last night and man am I glad that I did but let me break it down a little better.

Pro's: 
-great bar with an abundance of craft beers but not so many as to be daunting.
-menu is streamlined. Meaning, it WASN'T  twelve pages of poorly prepared items. It was short list of very fresh well prepared items.
-manager was very present and visible. (Nothing worse than a lazy absentee manager to make feel like no one gives a crap)
-Service staff while WERE busy, it seemed like there was good teamwork, and food arrived hot.
-was a good happy hour crowd.

Ok....now on to the Con's

- back to the service. I felt like, if you serve craft beers you should know a little more about them other than \"its good\", or \"its popular\".
- I felt as if they were working short staffed, that or it was just a very busy happy hour crowd.
Other than that i cant think of anything else negative to say. This review of food was based on an order of

-fish and chips= amazing!
-short ribs with creamed spaghetti squash and bacon Brussels sprouts=   very good(more like pot roast in my opinion).
-hot wings= amazingly crispy!
-mussels in white wine sauce with toasted herbed toast= amazing.(a meal in its own rights).
-and wait for it..............the omg bread pudding with house made salted  caramel sauce. (This alone is worth making a trip to this establishment).

So if you find yourself in Phoenix AZ, you cant go wrong by coming to this place."}
{"text":"Nice trendy atmosphere. Get the pretzel. I wasn't sold on getting a Bavarian Pretzel in Arizona. I was wrong. So darn good! The pork belly sliders are recommended, so we got em. They were not like a pork belly slider you would get in Nashville but really good.  If your there for a convention stop in here for dinner."}
{"text":"Food very good. Service very bad. They charged us wrong after waiting forever for check. Manager did right thing fixing bill and giving us a discount. Just disappointed in service."}
{"text":"Stopped in on the Urban Ale Trail. Friendly place good drinks. Love the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Came here after a diamond backs game - love the pub atmosphere ... private booths and long community tables ... super clean and well decorated. Amazing service!!!!! Server and busser were on top of it .... and really good wings"}
{"text":"Food was awesome!. Live music tasteful.  Crab cakes phenomenal! Service exceptional.  Go!"}
{"text":"Service wonderful, very friendly and efficient.  Food, both of ours - short ribs and fish and chips just okay.  All though the fries, chips were a soggy, greasy mess - yuck.  
I will come back for a cocktail and the fun energy but, likely not for the food."}
{"text":"The owner Tom is so down to earth and friendly. He made it a point to talk with us and make us feel at home. The food and beer were amazing!  The servers were super friendly and personable. I would definitely recommend making this the place to go in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"This place is me and my co workers \"to go\" spot for lunch and or a drink! Friendly staff, awesome bartenders and great food! (Always have the best soups). Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A colleague and I had a lovely lunch here. The service was good. The fish and chips was okay. The dessert was, according to her, blech. I'd probably give it another go, however."}
{"text":"Really solid pub in downtown Phoenix- sit at the bar for great entertainment. Food is pretty good, service is slow. 

Bartenders are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I met up with a dear friend tonight for dinner & drinks.  We get together often and it was her turn to choose.

We arrived at 6 and the joint was jumpin'!!! We found a booth and settled in to get caught up.  Our waitress helped make choices from the drink menu.  I chose a bourbon-based concoction and my friend opted for something gin-based.  Both were delicious.

We ordered main courses; I went for the fish & chips and she chose the skewer with veggies.  Both dishes were yummy and nicely prepared.

This place is nicely laid out with lots of wood and metal accents. There is ample parking snd the prices are reasonable.

We met one of the owners outside.  His name is Harrison and he is lovely, as are the staff inside.

I'm looking forward to going back for poutine! This is a nice little pub and I wish them great success...."}
{"text":"Any spot where the owner comes out to greet customers in the middle of a Saturday afternoon is off to a good start. Great whiskey selection, world-class Reuben, and friendly staff... I couldn't ask for more"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Friendly & attentive staff. The fish was crispy, fries were fresh. Cole slaw was what you would expect. Stella was cold. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Good food in a good downtown location.  The service was great and the appetizer pretzel was superb!"}
{"text":"Obviously a new restaurant still getting into the groove. Great service great food. Not many options on the menu (the menu pictured on here isn't correct) ***hated that my food was served on a \"cutting board\". It was cute visually but my food was falling off the sides on to the table and that's gross to me and made a mess. I just personally didn't like it. 
I ordered a bacon onion burger cooked medium and it came out well done however it was really good even though it was over cooked the bacon onion mix was so so good!  so I would give them another shot because they are brand new."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night. The food was amazing, long wait but totally worth it. The owner passed out free shots and took money off our bill due to the wait. Now that's good business! We will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for dinner after both not agreeing on what we wanted to eat. The menu here seemed to offer some things we could both be ok with. We sat at the bar like we do sometimes. The bartender was super friendly and helpful. I ordered a local beer, which I do when we travel, and my wife got some wine. I ordered a black bean burger and fries with their curry dipping sauce. I asked the bartender if their black bean burger was any good and he assured me it was, and he was right on! My meal was excellent- hit the spot. My wife had their 1st street burger and she enjoyed it as well. The house made hummus appetizer was also pretty tasty, with a bit of a different texture and taste than I am used to. The atmosphere was cool, with some Deltron 3030 playing on a lower volume in the background for optimal digestion and conversation. Upon leaving, the super cool bartender shook both of our hands and thanked us. If I was from this area I'd totally make this place one of my spots."}

The Kettle Black is located within a short walk of the light rail at 3rd/Washington.  It is adjacent to Cartel coffee and the signage on the sidewalk will allow you to find this gem easily.  Location:  5

The lunch menu has diverse selections for most any palate including vegetarian fare.  The bartender, Gil, recommended a few of his favorites.  I went with the Southwest Chicken Wrap (with a side of buffalo sauce) and the soup of the day (it was tomato basil).  The food was served swiftly and the taste and texture were excellent.  The presentation of the dish was fun.  I didn't even touch my soup until after I devoured the wrap.  The mellowness of the tomato basil soup wonderfully complimented the spiciness I created on the wrap.  You can also swing through and catch happy hour from 4-7 daily.  Menu:  5

The laid back, pub style atmosphere invited me to seat myself when I arrived after lunch rush.  I sat at the bar as this was an excellent location for my service dog to chill out while I ate.  The staff did not acknowledge my service dog and served me, the customer!  This is not a common trait across the valley and I GREATLY appreciate their professionalism.  The food came out quickly and Gil ensured all of my needs were met throughout my meal.  Service:  5

The overall vibe for me was professionally chill.  The staff worked well together to ensure every customer had a great dining experience and didn't incessantly hover.  The artwork on the walls was among the more unique that I have seen in a restaurant.  The woodwork created an old pub feel.  The service made things fresh and fun.  Some of the booths would work well for a small team to have a working lunch.  Environment:  5

Overall, The Kettle Black is a great place for someone wanting to catch a quick bite from a diverse menu or that person who is wanting to take a break from downtown life and escape to an old pub with a fresh feel.  Be sure to ask the staff about some of the artwork or history of this fairly new pub in Downtown Phoenix.  Overall:  5"}
{"text":"The Kettle Black is terrific! We went with a huge group and we're treated warmly and our server was very attentive. The food and drinks were equally amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"So happy the fiancé & I checked this place out last night. Absolutely feel the British vibes immediately. Big plus if you're a big HP nerd like me. Bartender was warm/friendly & made our drinks nice & stiff. Will be sure to have dinner next time. The food looked amazing."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch while visiting for a conference and grabbed a seat at the bar.  The place has a very \"pub\" like feel.  I really wish I wasn't in the middle of work because it seemed like they had a pretty extensive drink list.  At the bar, they had several outlets (which for a solo traveler, I really appreciated- not something I would traditionally take advantage of if I was with someone else).
The bartender was friendly and prompt.  I ordered the grilled chicken club and fries.  I must have had \"midwest\" girl written all over, as he asked me if wanted a side of ranch for my fries.  I definitely didn't decline! The food came out pretty quickly and it was a generous portion.  Everything about the sandwich was fantastic- crisp bread, juicy chicken, crisp bacon, all topped with avocado & a nice aioli. The fries were a little on the cooler (than I would have wished side), but still good- especially after craving fries for nearly 3 weeks without having them!  I would definitely recommend if you are in town & need a quick lunch, or a casual spot to hang out."}
{"text":"Great bar!  Some different cocktails and a nice whiskey collection. Had the cheesesteak fries and they were so effing good. Saw some of the other food which also looked tasty. Friendly attentive staff. A definite stop next time I'm downtown."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the scallops are to die for, they were so good we actually ordered an extra entree just so we could have a few more! Out if this world! The crab cakes not as delicious, not bad but a little mushy, hence the 4 stars. Will definitely go back for the scallops."}
{"text":"This is the best place we ate at while visiting downtown Phoenix!  We came in for a big conference on Wednesday morning and I had an awesome Black Bean burger. Our waiter Alex was just the best...giving us suggestions on what to drink and eat. More friends made it in Wednesday night so I suggested this place. This time our waiter was Michael.  Again just fabulous service.  We came back 2 more times.  We had something different every time. Awesome food - thanks chefs!! Awesome service even when packed full. They always smiled and took great care of our needs. 

We will be back when we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"seriously the best pub in Phoenix....great food, atmosphere and service...our server was Alex and he was fantastic...and so was food"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Stopped by on Friday and grabbed a couple of seats. The 1st Street burger was juicy and tasty and the fish and chips cooked perfectly. Great pub atmosphere and reasonable prices. Will be coming back,"}
{"text":"I got the feeling of a real life pub when I walked in. Tons of beers and liquor choices. Nice decor and cozy. 

The food was really good. I went in for the 1st Impression Burger but it is only serviced at dinner. 

The menu was full of choices for you to choose from and everything everyone got, they really enjoyed. 

The menu was fairly priced about $12 per person. And the portions were generous. I hope to get back in before I live AZ to try out the burger I wanted. Lol"}
{"text":"This place was the perfect place to come in on a very cold night. We were hungry and we're at the suns game and decided to go have a quick meal and get out of the cold. The service was amazing. I first ordered the bread pudding and after looking through the menu further I switched my mind and wanted to go with the buffalo chicken fries. I asked our waitress it was too late to change the order and she said she would go check. She came back a minute later and said that mine was next and we caught it just in time. I was happy I was able to switch, the buffalo chicken was on the spicy side but certainly a good choice on a cold day. You get a huge bowl of fries with buffalo chicken chunks and cheese sprinkled on top. Next time I'll add in the bread pudding. Overall, I was impressed with the service, the food quality and portion size. Very good indeed!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to stop by here. If you are looking for a great selection of food and drinks, this place delivers. Gastropubs are a great place to find some really good food. 

Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Bartender was very attentive. Plenty of seating at the bar and tv's to watch sports. Restaurant had a nice decor and was clean.  

The bartender recommended the Pork Belly Sliders with fries. Excellent choice! The Pork Belly Sliders are honey sriracha glazed with Asian slaw, and wasabi mayo. A ton of flavor and filling. Comes with two sliders. 

The fries are amazing!! I highly recommend them. Hand cut, cooked perfectly (crispy) and salted. You can order them as an appetizer. Comes with either house made curry or garlic aioli."}
{"text":"Nice place in downtown Phoenix. Great local draft beer. Irish pub feel. Busy Saturday night so sat at the bar. Very friendly bartender took great care of us. Had the Ruben and my wife had Mac and cheese. Will go there again."}
{"text":"Ah man I was real disappointed in this place.  I've been wanting to come here forever it feels like.  Finally popped in on a Saturday evening around 8-9ish.  The place was packed and although a lot smaller than I had envisioned it had a dope feel to it.

We were seated near the front by the servers POS (odd spot to put it right where customers walk in but who am I to judge).  Our server was friendly and helped us with drinks right away.  

I ordered the Kettle Black drink and fish n chips.  The drinks took a long time to come out.  We sat around forever.  Unfortunately, the table next to us were 3 20 something year old ghetto catty girls and an older boring looking dude looking to score.  The ghetto talk went on and on about how one of them left the other one at some sports event and how drunk she was and couldn't believe she left her with her other friend that she introduced her to in the first place.  On and on and on.  I was ready to leave both of them in the desert by the time our drinks finally arrived.

The drink was tasty but short and jam packed with ice.

The fish n chips came out shortly later.  The fish was tasty but one small piece.  The fries were soggy and limp.  The coleslaw was super sweet.

We ate the fish, some of the soggy chips, ditched the candy coleslaw and heard the rest of the conversation unfold.  We honestly couldn't wait to get the hell out of here.

Check finally arrived and we bounced out as quickly as we could.  Perhaps it was the fact we were smashed against the other customers and they wouldn't shut the hell up and that accounted for some of the disappointment. 

Not sure but wouldn't come out of my way to return and not a recommend at this point."}
{"text":"Sara(h) our server was very good (we had 7 people at our table). Irish stew and pork belly Mac and cheese were really good.  Yelp reviewers didn't disappoint again."}
{"text":"Service was really slow. Ordered a bowl of soup. The bread served along with the soup was too small ( half the size of a sandwich bread.) that too just one slice. I asked for more bread was 1$ + for another slice. After 30 minutes it was time to leave and noticed the order of bread never came. We were done with food and asked for check. She brings check, kept the bread wrapped in foil on table didn't say a word and walked away. I haven't seen such a terrible service in my entire life.

The food was terrible too. We ordered southwest chicken wrap and blackened chicken sandwich. Both were bad."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 bacon onion burgers. They all came with no visible bacon that we could see or taste. Served said its somewhere embedded in the onions (??).. also the medium well one was cooked rare. The side order of fries came late, and were also some of the worst we've eaten (small, over cooked and oil dripping).. not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"My husband took me here as a surprise for my birthday because we had been meaning to try this place for ages! Overall, I would definitely go back and it was enjoyable. The food was above average for a pub. I did like that they had options other than the typical fish and chip fare most pubs tote. The dishes were creative and tasty but still affordable and they did have the fish and chip fare still if that's what you wanted! The ambiance was relly enjoyable and I liked the lower ceilings, darkened feel and the way the booths and tables were situated. This place honestly is great for dinner and it would be great for a happy hour or start of a night out with friends. The only suggestion I would make would be to beef up the draft beer list. The only craft beers on tap when we went were Sculpin, Racer 5, and a San Tan IPA. I could have just been unlucky, but I was definitely expecting more draft beer depth."}
{"text":"*heart eyes* is all I can say for this pub. Ironically I didn't get anything to drink here, but the food and the service were outstanding. We ordered the mussels, Philly cheesesteak fries, and the salmon entree. The mussels were so good with the fluffy grilled ciabatta bread slices, and the Philly cheesesteak fries came in a huge portion for only $10 (we actually had to take it to-go in the end). The salmon entree came with a butternut squash risotto that was probably the best I've tasted, and the dried cranberries gave a great sweet flavor that went well with everything else. But best of all, we were constantly checked upon and made sure that we didn't need anything. Judging from the menu, they have a long selection of beers and cocktails as well."}
{"text":"This Irish Pub/restaurant is okay, just okay. Nothing special on the scale of places to eat lunch in Phoenix. 
We dinned here three days while staying across the street at the Renaissance Hotel. The first two meals were good. The third day I ordered an arugula salad which was brown and tasted old. I ate a few pieces of blue cheese and candied nuts then pushed it aside and shared my husband's lunch with him. When the waiter took the full salad away I mentioned the greens were brown, limp and old tasting, to which he replied \"oh\". So I repeated myself. The greens in that salad have gone bad. So he said \"okay I'll let him\". When he came back with the bill I asked him if he had told the owner/chef and he said \"yes\" and started to walk away. I said \"what did he say, too bad\"? The waiter said \"yes\". 
Suddenly I was reminded of the show \"Bar Rescue\". Grossed out completely, I wondered how complaisantly the rest of the kitchen was being managed. 
Let me say, the greens on my husbands side salad (not arugula) looked very fresh. Upon making the salad, I don't know why the cook didn't offer me the fresh greens in place of the arugula. Funny how a restaurant/bar owner can get so hung up on himself that he would risk a bad review and \"surprise kitchen inspection\" just to save his 3 dollar cost of goods in making it right with the customer. We will not return on our scheduled trips to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Downtown has been needing a bar like this for quite some time.  A smaller Irish pub with Very good service and pretty good food.  I had a burger and a bunch of us shared some appetizers (pretzel, chicken, philly fries) and it was all good.  I wouldn't mind stopping in sometime after a ball game and having a few beers.  What Irish bar doesn't have shepherds pie? Maybe it can be a special they run once a month or so - I would definitely stop in and try it."}
{"text":"Have walked past this place plenty of times, only to usually end up at Majerle's. Turns out that passing this place was a mistake because the food and service were great. Arrived during happy hour, but the drinks are only a buck off as my Guinness was now down to $6. They did have some good happy hour food deals, but we went straight to the main course. The burger, which I tried, was terrific (1st street burger?) with lots of quality toppings, but the Rueben might have stolen the show. They hand brine the corned beef in-house and then slice it and that is the start of the rueben. Usually, corned beef is chewy, but in this case it almost melted in my mouth and the blanket of saeurkraut and swiss cheese made this a very pleasant eating experience. The waitress with tats was very nice and also the fries are handcut and tasty. Small patio for people watching is a bonus. Good stop pre-game or pre-show."}
{"text":"Great service! Very attentive and quick. The ambiance was nice too! Me and my wife were on vacation passing through and this was a great addition! The beer was good and my wife said the turkey burger was amazing!"}
{"text":"The Good:

- Great location

- Authentic pub feel

- Wooden floors or faux wood, either way, very nice touch

- The build/construction of the actual bar, the liquor display, the area where the bartender works just screams pub.

- Curb appeal doesn't get better, opened red wooden shutters onto sidewalk café is warm and inviting.

- Liquor menu is no nonsense, relatively small but carefully selected varieties of bourbon, whiskey and scotch. The mixed drink menu was not available, I understand it is being reworked. 

- This place just opened and it has great promise if they can work out some of the bugs.  I expect to write another more glowing review in a few months.


The not so good:

- Flat screen HD TV's all over the place showing basketball.  Nothing and I mean nothing kills pub atmosphere more quickly and thoroughly than TV sports.  You can go anywhere to watch crap sports, it would be nice to find a watering hole where you could escape sports.  People tend to disengage from each other and look up at the TV.  Instead of strangers meeting and having conversation, they just look up at the TV like they are in a dazed state.  Even couples who enter together often do the same, and if they do try having a conversation, the TV's are so distracting they can't keep a single train of thought.  If you have to show sports, why not something different like rugby, Irish hurling, Aussie football, professional darts do something to set yourself apart from every other sports bar out there?  If you want to turn a bar into an instant ghetto, put up a bunch of TV's and play the big four, NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB.

- The music was awful.  Such care and effort went into designing and building this wonderful space  just to have it ruined by (I will be kind here)  \"urban\" music.  It's a pub, why not play more traditional anglo Irish music?  Again, Majerles and any number of  other sports bars are just around the corner.

- The menu mirrors the music and TVs, too busy, too much and incongruent with the space.  Turkey burgers, kabobs, Southwest chicken wrap, wasabi Caesar wrap, black bean burgers ....  My advice is to keep it simple and keep it authentic, if you try to be all things to all people you end up being nothing to anybody.  A menu like this stresses out the kitchen, leads to waste, spoilage and does little to enhance the atmosphere or reputation.  The \"Across The Pond Fare\" on the menu was not available as it also is being reworked.  The menu should consist of ONLY the \"Across The Pond Fare\", Irish Breakfast, rashers, Pastys, Shepherd's Pie, Cottage Pie, blood sausage, black sausage, white sausage, fish and chips, corned beef and cabbage.  If you have to serve burgers, keep it simple.

- There is a bit of confusion at the front gate.  The iron fencing around the sidewalk café is black and so is the gate.  I saw several groups of people having a little trouble locating the gate as they tried to enter the pub.  A nice coat of red paint that matches the shutters or a decorative piece attached to the gate would help people find their way in.


In closing, the Kettle Black has everything in place to become a great success, something on par with the pubs of D.C., N.Y. and Boston."}
{"text":"Excellent whiskey and delicious food, even if lacking more authentic options.  It's not very spacious and can get crowded quickly.  I'd happily return."}
{"text":"They have an excellent tap list and I think they're definitely finding their niche in the Phoenix gastropub market.  The buffalo chicken fries weren't exactly what I was expecting.  They aren't \"chicken fries\" a la Burger King but buffalo chicken on top of actual potato fries.  I enjoyed them but felt the menu description was a bit misleading.  

Bread pudding was good although not the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"yup. ok. Friendly staff, small, cozy & loud. Not a bad place. $7 for a basic draft seemed spendy. Crabcakes...nice horseradish flavored topping. Comfortable place to sit at the bar solo and enjoy."}
{"text":"Irish pub.  So it is loud.   Even on a Sunday night.  Good service. Good burgers and bread pudding"}
{"text":"First time in downtown Phoenix and had lunch here after reading the favorable reviews.  If you want a tasty burger, try the Bacon Onion Burger.  Delicious!!"}
{"text":"The crab cakes with wasabi aioli were the BEST I've ever had! The staff was also really attentive - we loved the relaxed, friendly vibe. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We came in with our baby around 5:30pm and we're greeted by the owner. He helped clear space away for our stroller, which was great. 
Another nearby restaurant turned us away because they wouldn't let us bring a stroller in, so we appreciate Kettle Black accommodating us!

Great service & good food!"}
{"text":"Had Atlantic salmon with mango salsa and avocado dip. Was very delicious and filling.  The food came out pretty quick. The place is quaint and the service is good. A little pricey but worth the extra bucks for the quality and taste."}
{"text":"Where to start?! The bar is filled with beautiful wood and cool ceilings the bartenders are so nice and helpful and the food is amazing! We ordered the pork belly sliders with truffle fries for only two dollars more. I got a gin and tonic my bf got a Paloma each were only $5!The cocktails do get a little on the pricey side if you order from the menu we got a rose and pablano cocktail that was $12 pretty good but wouldn't order it again. This place played really good music and we lived the vibe definitely will go back."}
{"text":"What an awesome find! They've only been open 6 months. This bar has so much character. It looks like something out of the 40's, and the food was fantastic. The mixologist there, Jesse, is also super cool and has worked at prestigious bars in New York. So he knows what he's doing! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We came while there was a special event going on but were still able to get seated right away. 

Started with the fries.. This was definitely the highlight of dinner!  They are a must try!  The curry sauce and garlic aioli are both fabulous and it's hard to choose which one to dip from..

I had the black bean burger which was yummy but slightly dry.  I didn't sense the sriracha sauce that comes on it.  It's nice that salad and soup are both side options for the sandwiches and the side salad didn't disappoint.  

Typical upscale-ish Irish pub sorta vibe inside.  Good and friendly service."}
{"text":"The Kettle Black is a new restaurant that recently opened on 1st street in downtown Phoenix. When I initially saw the menu and photos of the place I was excited to try it out. I thought it would be a nice addition to the restaurants in the area.

Unfortunately I was not impressed with anything here. The staff was very nice and the atmosphere was accommodating but I found the food and vibe to be extraordinary boring. I think a more succinct way to summarize this restaurant is: generic. There is nothing particularly interesting or different about this place, which means I will not go back.

We visited on a Thursday night and the place was surprisingly busy. There were only a few tables available which I took as a good sign. The music was... strange. I heard several 90's alternative techno remixes, this is a detail that may or may not be useful to you (it certainly is to me).

I can overlook a restaurant being boring or uninspired if the food is really good, however, this was a let-down also. I ordered the 1st Street Burger, it was served on a small cutting board... I'm not sure why, this \"fun\" idea became immediately impractical as I had to contain all of the drippings on a very small/localized area. The burger itself reminded me of something you would order at a chain restaurant such as a Chilli's or Applebees and that may be the crowd they're targeting with their proximity to the stadium. 

The one bright spot were the truffle fries, if I were 4-5 drinks in I may be convinced to return for another round of these. 

The Kettle is Whack, stay away."}
{"text":"I have two words for you... French fries. OM good God. Wow - the Philly version is ridiculously delicious, and the wait staff is delightful."}
{"text":"I literally never write reviews, but this bar was one of the best I have been to. The steamed mussels were some of the best I have ever tasted. The owner was in the bar genuinley making sure everyone was doing ok. Great food, great atmosphere, excellent service."}
{"text":"Very good little spot for lunch. I had a salad and it was good. The service was slow, and sitting inside is a little claustrophobic, but all in all it was good place for lunch. The food is only average however."}
{"text":"Forget the packed corporate spots down the street. Better food, inviting atmosphere, tasty libations. Family friendly and TVs if you want them."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best black bean burgers I have had. The curry fries and garlic fries were so amazing you would not stop eating the entire basket.

Anyone who is staying or visiting downtown Phoenix should absolutely visit this place."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, good service, good atmosphere. There are so many great pubs in Phoenix that they tend to blend together after a while, and this place is another great pub. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We will definitely be back! Hubs and I had dinner here before a concert. We got in at the right time! We had the Philly cheesesteak fries...  holy moly they were so good. Also got the pork belly sliders which hubs liked. The California club was also delicious. My only complaint? The cole slaw was warm. Not sure if it's because it was served on a hot plate? The place started getting busy but we never felt rushed by staff to leave. Oh, and good beer selection!!"}
{"text":"Go for the beers, not the food. Service was great, but our meh meals left us regretting our choice for dinner. Even the fries... how can you go wrong with fries? So many other places nearby will leave you better satisfied."}
{"text":"Cool Bar and Crowd! Great choice of beers and drinks, had fun with friends there. Must try the pretzel and soft cheese!

Reason for 3/5 rating is the execution of the food options. 

We tried the fries: over saturated with oil and salty.

The pork belly sliders: had a sweet honey sauce but was very dry which may be from the overcooked pork belly. Usually theres so much flavor and texture to pork belly, wish this was the case.

The 1st order burger: which had a great look but the final taste lacked seasoning or flavoring  in the meat. Bread and meat patty was breaking apart pretty easily which made finishing it harder. 

Not to say all the food choices were bad, friends tried the grilled steak salad and mussels, didn't try this but they said it was good! Overall, we had a good time and would stop by again for drinks!

Thanks for reading, hope it helps!"}
{"text":"Great food, service, and atmosphere.  I highly recommend the fish and chips. So good.  The pretzel and sauces were outstanding as well.  Thanks Brooke so serving us   You are awesome"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sat night and got lucky with a table for 4. We waited no more than 20 min. There staff was super friendly!! I had the Reuben sandwich..I just needed to add more sauce but it was yummy. Hubby and daughter had the scallops...really good! Son had bacon burger with fries. He liked it! Will visit again if every in downtown Phoenix and try their pork belly."}
{"text":"I'm an out of towner who was in town for Rangers Spring Training and the Viva PHX festival. In between the baseball game and the music festival we wanted to find a spot we could chill at until it was time to go hear some music. I had looked for good Yelp reviews in the area, and this place came up. 

When we got there, it was super crowded. I almost said let's go somewhere else, but a couple ended up getting up from the bar so we snagged those seats. 

The bartender was friendly. We ordered wine here and an order of buffalo chicken fries. We were debating between the Philly Cheesesteak fries or these, and the bartender said we should definitely go with the buffalo chicken fries. 

I ordered bleu cheese on the side because my girlfriend hates it, and I'm only a fan of a really tiny portion on my buffalo saucey stuff. The fries were good. We split them, and that was plenty of food to hold us over. We were going to order more food as well, but we had to get going to the festival. 

Overall, it was a nice environment. Crowded like I said... So you may be in for a bit if a wait. Sitting at the bar is one good tip I have for this place."}
{"text":"Always welcomed with a smile and a heavy pour of Jameson to go with my Guinness. The fish n chips are a nice size cut of cod. You won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"In town and selected this restaurant based on the 4.5 stars. Very good, service a little slow for lunch. I had the chicken club, table mates had the fish and chips, Rueben and a burger, all said were good. Great music and craft beers, its a place to revisit."}
{"text":"This is the only place downtown offering happy hour on a Saturday night for folks like me visiting and staying downtown. I called Steve's grill right across the street from my hotel, the Hyatt to ask if they had happy hour, they hung up on me."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a while! We popped in here for an after dinner drink and had a great time! The ambiance was fantastic, drinks were inexpensive, friendly service, and late night eats were on point. I had a good ol' gin & tonic and the fiance had a great beer. We also split the pretzels and cheese because we were a tad hungry. And lets be honest, pretzels and cheese are always a good idea! We'll definitely be back when partaking in shenanigans downtown!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places to eat while on business in Phoenix.  It is a gastropub with pub God and good service.  The hamburger I ordered was one of the best I've had in a while.  The service was efficient and food came out quickz"}
{"text":"Brand new! Great locatjon, atmosphere, food, drinks and service! Try the fish and chips and paid it with one of the many scotches available"}
{"text":"My wife and I and 2 friends decided to try out the kettle black for a quick dinner and a few drinks before the Stevie Nicks concert. We arrived roughly 1.5 hours before the concert was to start. We were seated right away which we didn't expect because the area we were in in Phoenix was busy due to the concert. Our waitress was friendly and got our drinks to us pretty quick. She took our order and we explained to her we were in town for the concert so we had to be ready to go by 6:45ish.  The food seemed to be taking a while but our waitress came by to top of our drinks. Later, the manager stopped by, without us saying a word about the long wait for food, and offered us free drinks and a discount on our dinner. He did say the restaurant filled up very quickly and unexpectedly and was very apologetic for the wait. Needless to say, the food was excellent and our dinners were highly discounted.  Great, great service!!  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great pub in downtown.  Stopped in for lunch before dropping family at the airport. Excellent fish & chips, Ruben and burgers.  Reasonable pricing, great location and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Reuben and a pasta salad in downtown Phoenix for lunch. 

Getting set for the Final Four...PUMPED !!"}
{"text":"Looking for something easy and appealing for an overnight in Phoenix with an early morning plane flight. We got in a little later than we'd hoped and a couple of the Mexican places that looked good close at 8pm. Waiter recommended a very good local IPA (brewery is on 16th St he said--we didn't have time to check it out). I had the Turkey Burger---greens, avocado, etc. on an onion bun and my DC had the bacon onion burger. Both were excellent--and a nice comparison of flavors (not one of those places where all burgers taste the same except for a central patty of some kind). There was a nice crowd at 8pm on a Thursday, and they were REALLY good about refilling our water glasses w/o even asking. YAY."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Atmosphere was good!  Come here and hang out.  We were not in a rush. Food was fantastic. For AZ, the crab cakes were good!!  Philly cheesesteak fries were great. Fish and chips tasted fresh and light. We spent the night in one of the pub style Windows looking out and had a great time. Bathrooms were clean"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant walking distance from the sports fields.  We stopped in after a Diamondbacks game in a Sunday, and the restaurant was pretty quiet.  We sat right down and serving staff was friendly and prompt.

Wife ordered the pork belly Mac and cheese - fairly basic recipe.  I would have expected a bit more flair, which takes away a star.

I ordered the pork belly sliders - two reasonable sized slides with Asian inspired slaw - very good.  

The place has a nose atmosphere, but it seems to be caught between wanting to be an American inspired bar and an Irish pub.  Still, I would recommend if in the area."}
{"text":"Hands down best Bar food in downtown Phoenix. 
The Ruben is the best I have ever had and the peppercorn steak is delicious. Fish and chips and burgers are awesome too. 
They also have really fresh Guinness. 
Bartenders are friendly and this bar/ restaurant is my absolute favorite when visiting Phoenix. 
Try it and see"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The food is amazing and the service is even better. Ask Harrison (I hope I got that right!) about local beers (I'm from out of town) and talk to Billy about the food. I travel a lot for work and I don't usually go to the same place twice but we are considering a THIRD time because everything about this place is great. The atmosphere is welcoming and comfortable. The food and drinks are spot on. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"First time to this place. Taken there for Fathers day by my youngest daughter. Normally takes us to eclectic far out joints. I was more than pleasantly surprised. Atmosphere was that of an Irish Pub without being overly done. The food, Scallops in a special sauce that I can't remember,  was excellent. Others at the table had fish and chips, and pork belly sliders. Didn't try there's but they said they were both great. The scallops were large enough and very meaty. Appetizers of crab cakes and Humus were also very good. This spot is now on my radar. Very convenient to Talking Stick Arena, Chase Field, Convention Center. One of the few places downtown that stays open after Suns and Diamondbacks games."}
{"text":"How to describe The Kettle.  Its owned by a couple of Irish ex-pats, but its not an Irish pub per se.  The contemporary Victorian style interior might trick you into believing this could be a British pub, but no its not that either.  There's plenty of TVs at the bar, so is it a sports bar?  However you wanna describe The Kettle, its most certainly a pub unique to Downtown.  I had the The Kettle on my to do list for awhile and I figured I'd come in the middle of happy hour on a Tuesday, expecting a light crowd and a chance to soak it all in.

The Kettle is located next door to La Piazza PHX (an excellent Downtown pizza joint) just north of Washington on 1st Street.  When I came in just before 5pm, I had expected to grab a seat alongside a light afternoon crowd.  To my absolute astonishment, the place was packed.  Kettle's convenient location to much of the Downtown work crowd would at least partially explain this, but a full house in a restaurant that seats upwards of 80 people?  On a Tuesday?  Before 5?  With no concert or game scheduled that night?  Holy moly.  I actually arrived just as a seat at the end of the bar was opening up so I fortunately didn't have to wait.  Once planted in the corner, I went to work.

As I said, the place is owned by a couple of Irish ex-pats (Jimmy Culleton and Tom Montgomery), and they clearly were looking to put their own spin on a European-style pub.  No bangers and mash or corned beef and cabbage here, no sir (okay there is fish and chips, but I digress).  In fact the grub here overwhelmingly American in influence.  With bar food classics like pretzels, wings, and fries with different toppings, as well as main dishes like burgers, chicken sandwiches, and even mac and cheese.  The beer selection for the day is on the chalkboard up front and their cocktail list is available upon request.

I started with the The Kettle Black's signature cocktail.  Appropriately named...The Kettle Black.  Bushmills Whiskey (from Ireland of course), Cointreau Noir (basically an orange flavored French Cognac), Orange Juice, Lemon Juice, and Cinnamon.  Refreshing drink with no almost aftertaste, though I'll admit the strength of the alcohol slowly became pronounced after awhile.  For my main dish, I said burger me.  Given the options at my disposal, the Bacon Onion Burger was simply too tempting to pass up.  Swiss cheese, bacon, caramelized onions, a bacon-onion marmalade, garlic aioli, lettuce and tomato.  Served with fries and a side of ranch.  I will say the burger wasn't as huge as I thought it would be (other Yelp photos I saw of this burger made it look ginormous), but a really good hearty burger and I loved the marmalade on this thing.  The fries were a nice compliment too as they were cooked well done on the outside, but retained a nice chewy texture inside.  For dessert, I went with the Apple Crumble.  This version was topped with vanilla gelato and a cranberry gastrique.   The portion size of this dessert was quite large and could easily be shared by two.  The soft, warm crumble soaked up that gelato just right and the combo of apple and cranberry flavors worked perfectly.

Total cost for the cocktail, main entree, dessert, tax and tip came to about $40.  The food itself was pretty reasonably priced, though the cocktail was a little bit pricey for the size at $12.  I will say the service I received was a little bit slow.  There were two bartenders working the front and it was pretty clear the one I got was still learning the ropes (didn't catch his name).  His counterpart by comparison was a machine, cranking out drinks, conversing with the bar patrons, and keeping his station organized with almost military precision.  My guy had a little bit of trouble keeping organized which meant I had to wait a bit in between meals.  Not a huge deal though as I'm sure he'll get the hang of it.  The front bar was full of regulars (primarily Downtown workers) from all age groups.  Great pub atmosphere for conversation, people watching, and to let your hair down.  Call it a pub, call it a sports bar, call it a lounge, call it whatever you want.  I call it a welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Stopped in knowing nothing about it but it was close to where we were staying in downtown Phoenix. Super ecclectic? and comfortable vibe. Mainly burgers, fries and salads, Ali g with full bar menu. We enjoyed our salads.. fresh, perfect side, well priced. Would come again."}
{"text":"First time at the Kettle Black Kitchen and Pub. More of a pub than a kitchen. Very dark, deep booths, long bar and Manchester City banners. 

We arrived at noon on a Saturday and there were 12 in booths and tables plus four at the bar. 

I ordered Buffalo Chicken fries and a California Club. My son-in-law got a Bacon Onion Burger and a coke. It all came to $39.64. 

fries arrived in five mins

Our meals arrived eight mins later. The bread on my Club was toasted and as long as you have avocado on it, it will fall apart, which it did. Good potential for this meal but the side dish (fries) was better than the entree. Sad. 

Service: a big party came in so we virtually lost our server."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner in Phoenix. Cool place with a relaxing atmosphere. Reminded us of the East Village in NYC. Curried chicken soup was amazing. Chicken wing portions are large and tasty (went for the Sweet Chili). Nice beer menu and craft cocktail list. Friendly staff. Definitely coming back next time in Phoenix. Thank you Jay for the hospitality!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere in was pretty laid back and seemed to have a large variety of beer and hard liquor. Turns out I'm not a fa of bear but still my friends have liked it. I was bar hopping when I discovered this place. The selection was great. Although they did have a full kitchen which was the main reason for my stop unfortunately it wasn't open."}
{"text":"Server was nice and attentive.... food really tried.  The look was there,  displayed nicely on the plates; however,  taste was lacking. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"This is the size of the shot they provided us. It is .25 oz. that is a nickel beside it. For perspective. you get charged $5 for that. Fak this place. GO TO BLISS REBAR ON 3rd & GARFIELD AT LEAST THE DRINKS ARE FAIR. Included photos of their beer size, cocktail size and shot size. Omg."}
{"text":"Amazing!! We got right in and food and service was absolutely incredible! Everybody was so helpful and you could tell they all worked together to make our experience wonderful! We are here on vacation and this was by far the best stop so far! Must revisit! I had the braised short ribs and my husband had the fish and chips, both were fantastic."}
{"text":"I'm slightly surprised by all the rave reviews on here. Granted, we didn't have an awful or terrible meal but this establishment wasn't anything that I expected. 

First off, this is a bar (perhaps even a dive bar), not a restaurant. On a Thursday night, it was loud & rowdy, and the majority of people there were just drinking and not eating. When I see \"gastropub\" listed on the category I expect craft beer, good cocktails and good food. Sadly, it seems there are none of these things here. 

Beer - average selection
Cocktails - ALL very sweet (but strong)
Food - Meh.

I ordered the crab cakes and they were deep fried, which I think is a sign of a bad restaurant. My friend got the flat iron steak, which looked most unappealing on the plate but didn't taste horrible. Both dishes were very blah but what did we expect in a sticky counter type bar?"}
{"text":"The service was excellent and friendly. Unfortunately, the kitchen was closed so they were only serving appetizers.  The Pretzel and beer cheese was great, although the pretzels was drenched with butter (too much for our preference). The buffalo chicken fries were SOOOO greasy!! The flavor would've been good but the grease was overwhelming. We would probably come back to try some dishes, and maybe the pretzel and cheese again but would ask for light butter."}
{"text":"Drink was perfect! Truffle fries were good. Chicken salad was below average and service was extremely slow. I'll be back for drinks and appetizers only."}
{"text":"I was a tad disappointed in this place only because it's parent restaurant had all the menu items listed as this place did on the website, but in reality most were not available at this location. The Corned beef and cabbage was too salty...almost ruined it. However, this place has tons of potential, we can right when they first opened up and staff, beer selection and location make it worth another shot. I'll keep you posted. I gave 3 stars because it was good all around, but failed in some execution, but by no means bad."}
{"text":"We had intended to go to Hanny's but the wait was 45 minutes. We stepped outside, spotted this little place and thought we'd give it a try. I am SO GLAD we did! What a gem in downtown Phoenix! :) 

This is not your typical bar food at all. It's got style, class, pizzaz! Our server was fantastic and super friendly without being overly involved with our conversations. He kept drinks full, asked us great questions, and gave great recommendations.

We started off simple with the Bavarian Pretzel and they had a charcuterie sampler that was outstanding. I think it was a special because it's not on the regular menu. I had the Southwest Chicken Wrap and it was outstanding. The sauce had a lovely jalapeño kick to it and the chicken was perfectly done. My husband had the peppercorn flat iron steak. It was excellent. The potatoes on the side were AH-MAZ-ING. One friend had the Bacon Onion Burger which was out of this world and the other had the Reuben which was the best we've had in quite some time. 

Prices were quite reasonable, service was excellent and the food was really worth the trip. 

I'm really looking forward to going back the next time I'm downtown! I hope you'll give it a try!"}
{"text":"Walked over from hotel for quick late lunch. Split sliders and fish and chips with my husband. Both were excellent!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a group of coworkers and we all agreed this place will have repeat customers! The food was amazing; from the pretzel with mustard, to ahi tuna salad, philly cheese fries, fish and chips, and chicken wings. The mood in the pub was relaxed, slightly dimmed and our server Wes was nothing short of excellent!"}
{"text":"I was surprised at how much I didn't like this pub. 

I was there for dinner and sat at the bar. I ordered the mussels, a side of truffle fries, and the bread pudding for dessert. 

The mussels were fine, not spectacular, not terrible... Really just unmentionable. 

The fries had two drops of truffle oil on them, and I had to have them bring me the oil so that I could do it myself. 

The worst part of the meal was the \"bread pudding\" it's a joke. It's a very creative way for the restaurant to use all of their stale brioche rolls from the burgers that don't sell, but it was awful to actually eat. One of the rolls had grill marks on it from it being heated for a burger! It was stale, and really just lazy. 

Bread pudding is baked, made with love, and a pretty important historical Irish cuisine. It was insulting to eat it, and they should be embarrassed. 

I give it two stars for beer, and for being downtown."}
{"text":"Nice find. Beer was cold, but if you have to order a mix drink ... make sure to order from the drink menu. They have a good selection of craft beers, but a limited selection of beer on tap. 
F'n good tartar sauce with the yummy fish and chips. Unfortunately, the coleslaw was room temp. 
Delicious reuben. Not greasy. Good fries."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere if you like a chill place to enjoy a drink with friends.  Good local beers!"}
{"text":"Way to exceed expectations! The fish & chips were some of The best I've ever had & I grew up on Cape Cod so I know my fish. Excellent mussels as well"}
{"text":"We were staying in downtown Phoenix, and got in at a dinner-time so we picked a place close by. 
We ordered the chicken kabob, arugula salad, blackened chicken sandwich and garlic fries. 

The chicken was good on both entrees. 

However everything else was pretty terrible. The salad was wilted and had clearly been prepped and sitting in the fridge for at least a day, the green beans tasted like microwaved frozen green beans, and the fries were drowning in oil.

The gentleman that served us was pleasant and did a very good job."}
{"text":"We came here to have dinner and drinks with family. The drinks were good. Decently strong. Food was just alright though. 2 of us ordered pasta which unfortunately would fall apart on our fork. But it was still a nice little spot to come into and enjoy your company"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now. It nails that pub feel just right. Service and food has been great every time! I'd probably drive down from my north Phoenix home to have the garlic butter wings. Not many places where you can find good wings that aren't covered in spicy sauce and these are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Nice pub.  

The people are nice, but the service and food was hit or miss.

Ordered a sandwich some chicken tenders and several martinis.  The sandwich was very good.  The chicken tenders were good but had been sitting under the lamps too long (as had the sandwich) and the first martini was warm.  However the server noticed the inadequate martini and had one properly prepared.

Pretty sure that the problem was staffing levels.  Will be back."}
{"text":"The mussels are to die for. Great food, great drink, amazing environment. When I'm in Phoenix I always go!"}
{"text":"Walked here from the Westin before the Lord Huron concert at the Van Buren. Took a little while to get service but once we did everything was good. My boyfriend and I ordered the fish and chips and pretzel to share. Both were awesome. Actually we agreed that the fish was probably one of the best we've ever had. Cool place to definitely check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The Chicken Kabobs were quite good! Nice environment to meet up with friends! Plenty of parking, but be aware that during an game at the stadium parking prices are $$$$$"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm from Los Angeles so I have to admit I'm a tad pretentious when it comes to good food. I've had plenty of burgers here trying to find the one Phoenix beefy, gourmet masterpiece that is a GastroPub burger and I've finally found my edible Unicorn. Rehab Burger, Delux and Rocket Burger have been my top until now and they do a fairly awesome job (top mention to my Main Slab Rocket Burger) but this place blows them out of the water. Tender, juicy, flavorful and complimented by the freshest toppings, this burger is THE BEST BURGER IN ARIZONA. If you feel differently, feel free to message me because if you know one better than here I have to try it to believe it. 

For those from Los Angeles think along the lines of Father's office, Black Sheep and Vaka burger. Yeah, that good. 


My boyfriend had fish and chips and I was surprised at how delicious it was (I don't usually like fish). It was ridiculously fresh. And the soup of the day (corn beef and cabbage) was magnificent. Honestly, not one thing we tasted was even kind of a dissapointment. Everything was so flavorful. 

As for everything else, the ambienece was great, the beer was fresh and hoppy and the waiters were sweet as hell. Our waitress didn't even seem bothered by my constant indecisiveness (everything looked so delicious I changed my order a couple of times). 

This is going to be a new regular spot for us. It cures my case of the homesick and then some."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner during a conference with some of my colleagues. We were told they don't make reservations for less than 10 but there should be seating when we got there. However, we were told to wait at the bar when we came because everything was full (although it wasn't). Then we sat at a table and about 5 mins later, we were told there was a reservation for that table (which sat less than 10) in the next 45 mins so we could either sit there and have to move when the reservation comes or we could move to another table now. We moved to another table which actually was someone else's & they ended up leaving because their space was given to us. The service was very slow. We seemed to have to flag our server down when we needed something. 

The food was really great though. Our table ordered the Philly cheese steak fries and hot wings. They both were excellent. I ordered the wasabi chicken Caesar salad, which was also great. I'm a Caesar dressing snob and they definitely delivered. 

We came towards the end of happy hour and were able to get some drinks in, which ended up being pretty good. Our server was not very knowledgeable of their drinks or that it was even still happy hour! 

The prices are fair. The restaurant itself is pretty small. Overall, the food saved this experience because otherwise I would have left due to the poor service."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the black bean burger and my colleagues loved the ahi tuna salad. Beer list was great!"}
{"text":"For a place that hasn't even done a grand opening yet, they are definitely putting out a great 1st impression. Went there for happy hour and its got a great vibe and some awesome snacks/apps. The Giant Pretzel with dipping cheese and house made mustard is amazing. Friendly and attentive bar staff just adds to the experience. Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with great pub food and drink. The pork belly mac and cheese has generous portions of pork smothered in a glob of decadent cheese. The dish is classic comfort food 101. There no shortage of Jamesons and Guinness; a great no frills pub to wash down the worries of work and friendly locals."}
{"text":"Wow - I love this new bar in downtown Phoenix!  We stopped in this past Friday night and couldn't believe how busy it was...clearly the word has already spread about how great this place is.  The staff was extremely welcoming, the atmosphere was great and the menu looked pretty good too.  I only gave it 4 stars because the beer list was somewhat limited...hoping that will expand as time moves forward.  This will definitely be a \"go to\" place when heading out for drinks in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"I ate there with a friend on 2/28/17. I had the fish and chips and asked that the chips (fries) be the truffle fries. My dish was fantastic. One piece of fish, but good sized and the fries were soooo good!!  I loved the truffle oil and they smelled wonderful. My friend had the same thing and liked it too. The waitress was friendly and attentive. I am only here for 2 weeks working. I hope to go there again before I leave."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of pubs in the UK. Quaint, colorful and inviting from the street. I loved the red shutters with bar stools that open out to the street. The iron gate outside is also a pub-by little touch. Inside, wood floors and a simple, yet good menu for noshing whilst enjoying good craft brews both on tap and in ye bottle. Guinness and Magners on tap too.. ( I'm a girl and I think that's special ). Happy hour is 3pm to 6pm but also comes later from what our waitress mentioned. There are also several, well priced  wines on the menu too. Cocktails are there, but there wasn't a cocktail menu to go from.. and that is okay.. I like that they keep it simple. My hubby and shared the mussels that are fresh, steamed and bathed in yummy, garlicky, wine sauce that comes with Irish brown bread for soaking that yummy goodness up with. The Reuben is authentic and good! A pub should always have a Reuben! This sandwich was thick with fresh cooked corned beef, just enough saurkraut, Swiss cheese, thousand island dressing all on marbeled rye bread. This was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time.. sometimes a Reuben can be salty, because corned beef is so salty.. it just is! This wasn't ! Now this was my hubby's sammy, so I could only snag a bite or two.. but I had a bit of order envy! I had the Blackened Chicken Sandwich, which was also very good. A good portioned chicken breast filet, blackened, topped with peppered crisp bacon, Swiss cheese, an avocado and a really good limey, peppery mayonnaise on a ciabatta bread. I had a side salad with my sandwich and my husband got the fries. Speaking of fries... LOTS of fry variety on the menu for drink noshing! Truffled fries; Garlic and Rosemary fries; Curry fries.. BUT also, more extreme fries like : Buffalo Fries that come with shredded chicken , blue cheese crumbles and dressing ! Totally reminds me of a night out of pub crawling in Ireland.. they love some fries over there when the drunchies hit:-) I was looking forward to more 'Pub' fare and had perused the menu prior to our stop into Kettle Black. I didn't see the , ' Across the Pond' part of the menu that has all day Irish breakfast and Veggie Pasty and my fav from the Irish lads: Shepherds Pie. They did have Corned Beef and Cabbage on the menu and the Fish and Chips.. so hopefully when we get back, this part of the menu is back too, as a real pub , should have some real pub food! That said.. I like this place.. A lot! The owner strolls around and says hi to everyone and the bathrooms are clean. I love that this is a new great place in downtown that isn't clubby and has more of a trendy, quaint feel. I would love to eventually see live music come in for a night or two ! Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First time here! Great restaurant, friendly staff and great food. Fish and chips was excellent! Wrap looked good as well."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and location. My table got the mussels, wings, and pretzel, respectively. They were all excellent. The fish and chips is excellent, as well (I got that last time). Best in town, I can honestly say. Great food for a bar. They have stone ipa on draft, a big plus for me, an ipa lover. We were in a hurry to get to a show right after our meal and the service gratuitously was expeditious with our bill. I'll be back many times. Walking distance to anything downtown."}
{"text":"I just wanted to say how surprised I was when I asked where the bathroom was and one of the servers literally walked me over it although he was clearly going somewhere else when I asked him about it , that's what I call VIP service ! 
The bartender was fast , friendly and took really good care of me and my girlfriend . I like the selection on music they were playing too .I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Was in town from Minnesota on a Business Trip and we decided to give this place a try.  This was an excellent place, great service, incredible food.  Had the Fish & Chips and it was amazing.  Very glad we tried this place!"}
{"text":"The Kettle Black Restaurant was really good. Nice, chill atmosphere to enjoy burgers and beers while catching a game. I highly, highly recommend the Philly cheese steak fries (this coming from a person who typically only eats fish, chicken, turkey) and the 1st Street Burger!!!! Delicious, delicious, deliciousness!!!! Their Jerk sliders were really good too. Also their wings were really good with the mild or their sweet chilli sauce. All in all if you're looking for a place to chill and get a quick bite either during a layover or to watch a game this is the place. Less than 10-15 minutes from the airport. Quick Uber ride and worth it!!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Sweet Chile Wings were probably the best wings I've had. Great service despite being packed due to the Final 4. Chicken sandwich was also good."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food and service were excellent!  I was on a business trip and met some friends at this gastropub for dinner.  I had their braised short ribs and salmon!  Wine selection is great!"}
{"text":"I live downtown, so I have a lot of choices for bars, but the Kettle Black is rapidly becoming my favorite pub in all of downtown.

Everyone is incredibly friendly, from the bartenders to the owners to the servers to the patrons. This is what keeps me coming back, and recommending it to others. I've pulled in regulars from other bars, various local friends, my daughter and her fiancé, and even friends from Tempe who took the light rail just to try it. Everyone loves this friendly place.

I've only tried a couple of menu items - the fish & chips and the Philly cheese fries - but both were quite good. The food prices are reasonable and a very good value.

My go-to drink is Jameson rocks, but they don't even pick on me when I back it with an Ultra instead of one of the real beers they have on tap. Drink prices are normal for downtown, and service is always quick.

I like bars, and I've visited this one well over a dozen times since it opened a month or so ago. Downtown needed a place like this: just a cool, friendly, relaxing place to hang out. Doesn't matter if you live downtown or are visiting for a game, show, convention, whatever. Hit the Kettle Black. You won't regret it.

And if you see a guy with a beard sipping a Jamo rocks and an Ultra, come say hi."}
{"text":"We just had some food at their soft opening and it was what you'd hope for fish and chips. Staff was friendly and enthused and the place was cool. Exciting for more places downtown that aren't right in Cityscape. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Friendly service, nice beer selection and a very large happy hour menu.

The food is a combo of on bar classics dressed up a bit -Philly cheesesteak fries - with some old standards thrown in for good measure - soft pretzel with grainy mustard & fish and chips. 

Our waiter was super friendly, explained/knew the menu well & - had we not been to full- nearly sold us on the dessert."}
{"text":"A British-style pub. Good drinks. Good food. Cool decor. At least 5 TVs. Great place!"}
{"text":"Great! Interior, food and staff. Menu had plenty of options. Spinach salad with chicken is what I got and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Love the small town atmosphere with great food and wide variety of drink. Been here and few times and will be back plenty more."}
{"text":"Walked into such a good vibe. Michael was our server and he was on top of it! Always came through and gave us amazing service with a smile on his face. He recommended the Hop Rising and if you love IPA's it's a must try. We ended up ordering the steak salad; definitely one of the best steak salads we have ever had! Epic service with a great vibe!"}
{"text":"My coworker highly suggested the Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna Salad. After spending a week eating various types of pub food, it did me good. It was actually a slaw of cabbage, broccoli, and kale with just enough dressing. I would get this again even if my body wasn't begging for vitamins and fiber."}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed, great food, attention given to special needs like allergies. We had Alex as our waiter, he was excellent. Kudos to the chef, obviously takes pride in his/her work."}
{"text":"But pricy, decent drinks, fish & chips was the frozen kind.  Recommend it for the drinks, and maybe a snack. Not really for a meal."}
{"text":"Hardly ever write Yelp reviews but if you are in the downtown Phoenix area the Kettle Black is an absolute gem & must visit. Food is one of the best in the area & Harry the owner is an awesome guy who takes care of his patrons. Was in town for a week & visited here multiple times during my visit, highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Food was delish. The Buffalo chicken French fries are insane and the service was great. We will 100% be coming back here. So many beer options."}
{"text":"Holy hell. What a nice staff they have. From the bus boys to the manager, Jay, everyone was incredibly friendly. (I work in the industry so I know how important these good reviews are to some people) Brooke our server was extremely outgoing, friendly, informative, helpful, and suggestive. We had some delicious food; apps and entrees. Brooke was considerate with timing all our food out perfectly considering there were some larger parties at the same time as us and if our food ticket got stuck behind theirs, we might have had to wait a little while longer. She knew her stuff and I really appreciate that. This place is also a soccer bar (ManCity) so talk to their owner and get yourself in early if you're into that. Highly recommended for anyone looking for casual pub food with a fun atmosphere and a welcoming staff."}
{"text":"We just stopped in for drinks and dessert and were very impressed! Great atmosphere, music and service. Very friendly staff and the Brioche Bread Pudding was to die for! We will definitely be back again to try lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This is a super fun place to eat. The decor is pub like (think Cornish Pasty but with IMO better seating). I ordered the turkey burger with fries, and my friend ordered the club without any bread or cheese as she's gluten free and dairy free. The staff was more than willing to accommodate her dietary restrictions. I thought my turkey burger and fries were very tasty. My friend thought her food was quite tasty as well, especially her coleslaw. Warning though, the garlic mayo is VERY garlicky. If you're in a date, maybe skip that bit. 5/5 Would come again."}
{"text":"What a nice gem! Fantastic service and carefully prepared meals. The staff doesn't look stressed, but busy and engaged. I'm glad we chose this place among the other brewery/bars. As a bonus they had a fantastic selection of seasonal IPAs!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend! Their food is delicious, fast service and everyone is so sweet! Great environment, it's the perfect place to hang out and have some drinks. The customer service is great!! I had the the California Club sandwich and it was perfect. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Awesome. We came in to watch a basketball game, and got really attentive service AND comped drinks when the owner asked if we wanted to sit at the bar instead of our table to accommodate a large group coming in. The place is clean and the staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"Disappointing service, average food and screwed up our orders.  No thanks again, lots of better options everywhere around you."}
{"text":"The best bar/pub you will find in Phoenix. Aside from the fact that the owner is amazing and good looking  the food and the drinks are absolutely made to perfection. Trust me, you want to come here when in down town Phoenix. But come early because it fills us real quick!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go downtown for lunch. If I don't have time to eat there then I'll call my order in for pick up. Being downtown, the service is quick and accommodating because people have to get back to work. I usually sit at the bar because it's so aesthetically pleasing and uniquely designed. The menu has great variety of foods but I've only ordered one item. I've been hooked on the seared sesame ahi tuna salad. It has a bit of a kick to it and I'm addicted."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to the game. Great Reubens  but I had the Ahi Salad and it was good. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"Visiting town. Kettle black was close to the hotel. Busy place but got a seat at the bar. Friendly staff. Quick service. Good food. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! From their delicious pretzels and fabulous steak to the amazing atmosphere this place has it all! Definitely one of my favorite new spots downtown! Nice work guys!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have a wide selection of whiskey and the food isn't bad either. The service has been consistently on point. The main bartender is Irish which is kind of cool."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot! My friend showed me place and absolutely fell in love. They have my favorite beer, Orange Blossom. And they have the best gourmet style pretzels that are so deliciously buttery and flavorful. They got an awesome mix of music going on in there, I felt like it my was own playlist going because I loved it so much. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, and great customers. This is one of my go to places when staying in Phoenix. If you eat here try the scallops."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in to check this spot out lastnight. The service was awesome- very attentive wait staff and manager. We had the chicken kabob and pork belly sliders- both were pretty good! The garlic green beans served with the chicken kabob were delicious. We each had a cocktail, which I felt was just OK for a craft cocktail. It was a little too syrupy for my taste preference but some may really like them. Overall, we had a good experience! The only reason why I only give it three stars though is that there wasn't anything special that makes me want to go back there. If I'm in the area again it's likely I would stop in but it's not likely that when I'm making plans that this place would come to mind."}
{"text":"Good selection of beers, both on tap and bottles and cans. Had the 1st Street Burger. Pretty good, nothing extraordinary. Service was great, friendly and attentive. Good spot for a brew and a bite. Friends got fish and chips, wish i had gotten that!
 Small place with a nice vibe."}
{"text":"Everyone's looking for a restaurant with the tastiest foods at an affordable price. Basing on my experience, I personally recommend this restaurant as an answer to this query. I love their delicious cuisines and excellent service at low prices that I really have least expected. They give priority to cleanliness and immediate action to the customer's orders, needs, preferences, and complaints. I can certainly agree with their promise of handing the best to their customers. Truly a high-recommending place!"}
{"text":"Love so many things about this place! Food, atmosphere, people. It's most enjoyable! Every trip to Phoenix includes a visit to Kettle Black."}
{"text":"Great food. Presentation was very well done. Pricing was a little high for the portions but the food is the reason you come here"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and the staff is incredibly friendly. We had the parmesan garlic wings, fries and several drinks and it was all really good.  The waitress and manager both stopped by frequently to make sure we were happy and our cups were kept full:)"}
{"text":"Food was good. It was loud and super crowed so we decided to eat at the bar and not sure that was the best idea. 
The bartenders were super busy and it was too intense for my taste.  Plus never cool to hear a bartender complaining about his job as he's doing it.  Not cool."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and each time have appreciated the vibe, the service, and the food. Start with the burger, then come back for a salad...be sure to accompany whatever you select with something from the bar."}
{"text":"Amazing owner, incredible staff, great food, brilliant place, can't recommend this place high enough!"}
{"text":"Great little place.  While at a conference in Phoenix we tried out the Kettle Black Kitchen for dinner.  This is within walking distance of the Phoenix convention center.  We sat at a table just inside the door right away on a Friday night.  The staff was very kind and accommodating.  I needed to hijack their power for my dying phone and they helped my find an outlet.  

Our group started with the Philly cheesesteak fries and the Garlic fries.  Both of these were very delicious. I ordered the chicken kabobs.  These were on a skewer and were perfectly seasoned.  The green beans were really delicious.  They were a little saturated in butter or oil, but a tasty add to the meals. 

Try this place.  You'll enjoy."}
{"text":"I debated 3 stars but settled on 4, maybe even a 4.5 and here's why.  The service was excellent. Our bar tender was knowledgeable about what he had, affable and very attentive. He   The food was .. meh.. i mean its ok, its not bad by any means and by pub food standards its actually pretty good. 

The atmosphere is definitely pub like and the decor and art is unique and adds to the place. It is downtown so parking blows but that's a given. Would definitely go back here, and if you are downtown this is definitely a good option."}
{"text":"I had the Reuben it didn't come with a pickle and the bread was not toasted,  the ingredients were good quality and tasted fine,  the preparation was the opposite."}
{"text":"Cool spot; pretty typical \"Gastropub\"  Menu is a little limited, but everything at our table was quite good. Good beer selection, but not too vast. Recommended if downtown. Has a cool vibe."}
{"text":"Fun spot to go to after the game! It's practically impossible to get an uber around that time so I love that this place is walking distance. My server was super sweet and personable. I love the craft beer selection and the menu is awesome"}
{"text":"Idk if it's because I was starving out of my mind or was it the ambiance...I called ahead to make sure to reserve a table...when I arrived, I was greeted by a friendly voice who guided me along. After I told him my plans changed and i will be dining by my lonesome...he offered the bar which also had a quick service turnaround. 

I had the kettle black burger with a \"couple\" drinks....along with the loud yet friendly background chatter...I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here...will definitely come back if I was in the area"}
{"text":"A real surprise downtown, great food, very good service and a very comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour! My husband and I were in town for a conference and stopped in for drinks. Draft beers were $1 off and well drinks were $4.50/each. We decided to order a Bavarian Pretzel ($5/each), which was delicious, and ended up staying for dinner. I had the California Club and my husband had the Ruben. Both sandwiches were great! Bartenders are very friendly and attentive. Highly recommend this place if you are in Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to visit this bar for a long time and it failed too disappointed. The kettle black is exactly the kind of bar downtown needed. Vibrant and charming. Food is great and the pints are equally as fantastic. Service is top notch too. This place is worth the trip."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was delicious. Close to Chase field and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Cool downtown pub for a quick bite and some drinks.Chill atmosphere,friendly staff.the drinks are reasonably priced for the area.Philly cheese fries are the best"}
{"text":"What a great bar. I had the fish n chips along with a pint of Guinness and was very happy with the quality of both. 

Waitstaff was friendly and efficient. It was great."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp! 

Found this place through your platform since I'm a first timer here at The Kettle Black Kitchen in Phoenix AZ. Easy to find, and friendly staff. Both food and drink options had great verities with a twist of tradicional American favorites."}
{"text":"Food ok. Service was terrible! Had to repeatedly ask for water. Water never came. 

Place was not busy but at our table for 4 the food came out 20 minutes from first person getting their food to last person getting food. 

Will not be back for sure."}
{"text":"Had a good time with a buddy getting a couple beers and some late night grub. Went with the bartender recommended burger. Had good flavor but a little weak on the bun game. Fell apart pretty quickly but went caveman style and knocked it out. Buddy ordered the chicken kabobs. Came out looking good enough for other bar guests to get intrigued. Only feedback would be for them to lower the lights or adjust them so the ambiance gets a better feel. Seemed like most were turned too high up and made it slightly weird feeling inside. Don't underestimate light bulbs."}
{"text":"Great service, fun atmosphere and good food.  We loved the hot chicken fries appetizer. Spicy hot."}
{"text":"We had appetizers and beer. Kinda noisy, but it was a Friday night. Good food! Will recommend!"}
{"text":"Tonight's goal was to indulge a little and then head to the Orpheum Theater for an event. We stumbled on this gem my husband had heard of before. I was a bit cynical since I wanted to eat across the street. There was a small patio outside but we wanted to be indoors. 

The minute we walked in I knew the hubs had made the right choice. It's our kind of place. There were booths, a very nice area, wood in enough places to add warmth and a cozy factor. From the get go, it just felt good to be there. 

Our server was quick to come over and offered a sample of a craft brew from a local brewery I'd never heard of. Tasty!  We were a bit early for dinner so we ordered from the lunch menu. Nice variety here. Salads, sandwiches, and more. 

Full disclosure: I am NOT a sandwich person. Not at all. Burgers yes, sandwich no. But, the chicken sandwich on a ciabatta roll with avocado, bacon and some delicious mayo concoction on the side was absolutely the BEST sandwich I've ever eaten. I am serious. Every mouthful was pure goodness. The best!  My side salad was fresh and the bleu cheese dressing and large chunks of cheese which I promptly savored. Yum! 

Another server tempted us with the bread pudding. Hmmm...do we dare? Remember I said indulgence was the goal, so glad we caved. Deliciously decadent and we loved every single bite.  

I think The Kettle Black will now have to be on the list where we take out of town guests and it will be our our regular list too!  Great service, cool place. A new date night place for us for sure."}
{"text":"Very friendly service, it's a good place to come and unwind after work or during work. We enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Love this place. Close but not too close the the stadium if your attending a game downtown. We sat at the bar enjoyed the perfect pour of Guinness. We had the crabcakes they were so good. Fresh fish & a great side aioli. Since we're heading to the ball game we didn't have dinner but all the good looked amazing we will be back. Service was great we went back for another beer after the game."}
{"text":"Good beer selection.  The food was above average.  However, it took us close to an hour to get our food.  It took one of our party 30 minutes to get a salad with no dressing on it and the other person who ordered a salad got hers in 45 minutes.  I went with the mac n cheese thinking that would be quicker since our waiter warned us the chicken kabobs would take longer.  The mac n cheese took 50 minutes.  I imagine that the kabobs would have been an even hour.  I might give the place another shot since the food was decent and maybe it was just an off night."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I'm from out of town, but man I was not impressed with the service. It was a weeknight and the place was not that crowded, yet it still took FOREVER to flag down a waitress to order some fries. To add to that, the truffle fries were really nothing special. The bartender was not particularly speedy either. At least the rum and coke was only $5.

At one point we went to sit outside. Beware, there was a homeless person who came asking for money then cursed us off for not providing any. Sit at your own risk."}
{"text":"Wow. Awesome food with awesome service. Nothing could be better. The black bean burger was the best I ever ate. My son had a cheeseburger that he still raves about. The bread pudding was better than anything I ever had in New Orleans."}
{"text":"We loved the design of the restaurant and the mood. My husband and I were very excited to sit down and begin our meal - I love when downtown Phoenix gets another high quality option for dinner.

We started with the battered chicken tenders appetizer served with mango chutney. They were great! However, the serving dish for the chutney was tiny - should've been for half or even a third the portion of chicken. We rationed it out to make it last, and still ran out halfway through. Next time the waitress came around, we asked for another serving of chutney. She informed us that it would be an extra $1.00 charge. WAT. Seemed a little ridiculous to charge extra for a dip that we barely got in the first place. We ended up using ketchup, which seemed a little second rate after the delicious mango stuff.

Considering that our bill ended up being over $70, it seems like the owners shouldn't have to add ticky tac charges not disclosed on the menu and risk putting off new customers."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place accidentally. I was originally trying to make my way to bitter and twisted a block or so away but saw this first as I exited the cityscape parking garage (I was only visiting for a couple days) so I just decided to go here instead and I'm glad I did. It's a really relaxed place with a great drink menu. I sat at the bar and started with the house drink - kettle black and an order of wings, half garlic butter and half spicy. The wings were nice and crispy but the sauces were nothing super special. The drink though, it was delicious. I got another drink called Broken China because the bartender recommended it and the steak salad with a spicy Caesar dressing. Both were great. It's kind of pricey but pretty much what you'd expect to spend at a bar on a night out. The bartender was really friendly too. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice decoration and Steve is simply an awesome guy, super friendly and professional.
But besides the decor and Steve... it honestly keeps me disappointed two time out of three: the food quality is not consistent and the beer is randomly unavailable: quite frustrating for a pub!!!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Great food and cold tasty drinks., Intimate yet warm and friendly. We were in the beginning of a Sunday pub crawl and were very tempted to just stay. Might have to make this our new Sunday spot. Highly recommend for an after hour spot or somewhere to go to just chill with friends."}
{"text":"Really good pork belly. They also have a pretty good selection of gluten free items. Yum, yum, yum."}
{"text":"Great place with first class services.  Our waiter gave our dog some extra love and that was great.  The food is delicious also.  Sat outside, it was great. Alex our waiter was awesome.  Thanks"}
{"text":"This place is really fun and the service was great! We just went for drinks and apps, but all the dishes that were coming out of the kitchen looked amazing! We got the pretzel and the Philly cheesesteak fries! OMG!!! Not only did the food come out super fast, it was so good! The fries were amazing and the ratio of fries to fixings was perfect! Our friends also got the wings and they said that they were really good! I can see us going again just before an event!"}
{"text":"i really like this place.  dropped by here after visiting heritage square and walked over, so i'm not sure of the parking situation.  it's in downtown phx, so there are several parking garages around, metered parking (good luck), and possibly lots in nearby complexes

the food was pretty good when i visited.  the mussels were really small though, so it was kind of pricey for the portion size.  the broth the mussels in was really good though.  best part was the server was real cool.  my ladyfriend asked for rootbeer and they didn't have any, so he offered to make a makeshift version!  how cool was that!  forgot the guy's name, but he was super nice and that was awesome of him to do that.  

the establishment itself was pretty clean.  they have booths as well as those tall standing tables, and seating at the bar.  restrooms in the back.  it's a pretty cool spot, i'd totally revisit when i'm in phx again."}
{"text":"Very Kind! The food & service was great! But even more, I had accidentally left my credit card there & couldn't retrieve it for 24 hours. They were so kind & honest! When I picked it up the bar tender again was super pleasant! I appreciate caring & kind people. I will remember this restaurant/bar & return when traveling back to Phoenix"}
{"text":"The restaurant is nicely decorated inside and the server was nice and attentive. The food selection was limited. I ordered the blacken chicken sandwich. The roll used for the sandwich was not great and the chicken on the sandwich was pounded very thin. The chicken to bread ratio was way off. My husband ordered the California chicken sandwich, it was better than mine for sure.
I wouldn't be opposed to stopping in for a cocktail, but I would definitely eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Our waiter was great! He was very helpful and patient with our large group. We got there when happy hour had just begun. I had a drink that had gin and peach in it, it was soooooo good and refreshing because it was pretty hot out. We ordered the buffalo fries, the philly cheese fries, buffalo chicken wings, clams in white wine and a turkey burger. All were great! The fries are huge and can be shared amongst the table, the wings can also be shared! The clams were delicious! I wasn't a big fan of the turkey burger but everything else along with the happy hour prices made up for that. When I'm in Phoenix I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We made the mistake of going on a Saturday night after the theater. The food was excellent but by no stretch of the imagination is this anything other than a bar this late in the evening. Extremely loud and raucous and a waitress who seemed very inconvenienced by having to provide food service. It would probably be an EXCELLENT place for lunch."}
{"text":"Ambiance: A classy, upscale medium-sized Irish pub. Noise level is moderate enough to enjoy a conversation with your Guinness. Patrons consist mostly of 30's to 60 somethings, mostly white collars after lunch, Theater goers, convention goers, and post game fans. Lay out consist of a long bar, long bench table in the middle and booth seats along the wall.

Price: On the high end but this is a classy place so I don't mind if it keeps the place classy. There are plenty of places for the post college crowd and the hipster crowed in Phoenix.

Service: Always well taken care off. The owner keeps adequate staff to keep patrons glasses full.

Food:  Not your typical bar grub, menu includes nice selection of salads (seared tuna salad, Citrus Asian Chicken) as well as your typical favorites; Burgers, fish and chips etc.

Summary: A classy old school Irish pub where you can enjoy a gentlemanly pint!"}
{"text":"Rockstar staff. Great service. Food was great. If anything comes out that doesn't meet your expectations just let them know and they'll gladly replace or remove it from your order."}
{"text":"Awesome experience!!!!! Ice cold beer plus plenty of selection... Billy is an absolute hoot! Had a great time in this fun place... upbeat background music as well... we will definitely check this place out again!!!"}
{"text":"This place was really good, the fish and chips were great, and so was the turkey burger. We got the buffalo chicken fries appetizer and it was tasty but really spicy so if you don't like spicy, stay away! I customized my order for the turkey burger quite a bit and the waiter was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Checked in to a downtown hotel for a conference and our whole group had not had a real meal all day. This place was a short walk away and exceeded all of our expectations. Great burgers and fries at a reasonable price, and we had great, fast service, too. It's a wonderful spot for business travelers - something to please everyone in a diverse group."}
{"text":"Placed an order of the kettle wings.. Started to dig in and found a long hair on one wing and an eyelash on the plate. Politely sent them back and the SECOND order came out with another hair!!!! The first couple bites were good, just to be disappointed. How does this even happen!? The server said \"not sure where it's coming from because my cooks don't have long hair.\" Well, my hair is in a pony tail and it definitely wasn't us. Not sure if he was trying to imply that.. We decided to order the pasta Genovese after being told that It was enough for two to share. It was decent, didn't have much flavor and one of us could have eaten it by ourself. Didn't leave feeling full."}
{"text":"I called the day before to see if they would be open early to show the Manchester game. I was assured by 2 people they would be. I'm sitting in front of the building while man u plays without me. What a let down."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and drinks before attending a show downtown. We arrived about 7ish and ended up staying until 930p. Not for fun mind you - but simply because our service was terrible and we couldn't find anyone to give us our check so we could leave. This is definitely a place to sit at the bar and get service - otherwise best of luck on your server noticing you. We ordered 2 margaritas (not bad but tasted like sweet & sour mix was used), fish & chips, and the flank steak. The food was pretty good, fries were perfect. The sauce that came w/ the steak was a bit sugary but still a delicious dish. The atmosphere was stylish, dark, divey, and worked well together. The service was very slow. We requested our check three times and didn't get anything until late (very tempted to just walk out). We attempted to order more drinks but the server would disappear and no one else helped us. Later (~20mins) the server returned and told us she had a big table and they had difficult picky orders (which why servers complain about other customers TO customers I don't understand). Food was good, drinks were okay, service was bad."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp after a Diamondbacks game, and I was not disappointed. The bar was sparsely populated on a late Sunday afternoon. I grabbed a seat at the bar, and the manager (I think) was friendly with beer selection. I ended up getting a cucumber craft beer. It was delicious with a light cucumber refreshing flavor on a hot day. I ended up getting a fish and chips plate, which the manager suggested. When it came, I was surprised it was only one piece of fish, but it was a HUGE piece of fish. Crispy and flaky fish, but the coleslaw was not worth finishing. Fries were decent too. I had some time to kill, so I decided to try the bread pudding dessert, and it was tasty and filling. I would definitely come back for the beer, and I would probably order different food."}
{"text":"Where do I start? The place was quite packed for a Thursday nite due to the Carrie Underwood concert, which I was also attending. My sister and I walked in and were immediately greeted by a cute, upbeat young man who pointed out a couple places that were available to sit. We picked the bar. We were served right away and given menus. So far so good. Then a gentlemen, the bartender, Jessy, came over and we ordered.... I guess \"a lot of food\" - okay - whatever- we wanted to try a few things- our prerogative. We had a good laugh about \"how much food we ordered\" which as an app and two entrees. Mr. Bartender, Jessy, who at this point, I decided to make small talk with because I wanted to know why he seemed a bit tense, glad I did because he does have a nice smile- when he shows it and makes a great cocktail. Don't be afraid of this guy - get him to smile and you are set... Anyway....Our food came and it was PERFECTO- loved it! For as busy it was, it was served quickly and hot. Key factors for me! We ate our food and only ate enough to save room for dessert!  Told Jessy we need MORE food and ordered our bead pudding! I laughed - he didn't - but whatever- it was served HOT and was amazeballs (yes- amazeballs) - we had one more cocktail... At which point the cute, upbeat young man that greeted us came by to ask how everything was- I told him how great it was that he was the social representative of the place- he informed us he was one of the partners. Made small talk with Harrison and told him we were quite impressed with our first visit here and added that even Jessy's mysterious personality was fun and we had fun seeing who could get him to flash his smile. 

Alas, the final words on my review- definitely hit this place up when u are in Downtown - you won't be disappointed - the atmosphere, food, drinks and people there are great- This will be my go to place in downtown from now on! Lastly- make sure to say hi to Jessy and get him to smile!"}
{"text":"In Phoenix for a volleyball tournament. Found this gem on Yelp. Everything was delicious! The pretzel and hummus are the bomb"}
{"text":"The service here is excellent. They have an awesome beer list, and yuo can't go wrong with their classic pub food. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We came to town for a quick trip and this popped up on yelp. I had the bacon onion burger and my folks had the Ruben and scallops. All dishes were delicious! Large portions. The wait staff is super friendly and welcoming. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service they get 4 stars, food brings it down a notch for me. I sat at he bar and the bartender promptly greeted me, very nice guy. He let me try the local brews they had on tap before I chose. Both were very good, it was an IPA and a scotch ale.

I decided on a burger over the array of sandwiches. I have to be honest, it was bland, very bland. It sounded like it'd be bursting with flavor but I don't know, there was nothing to it, it had no flavor in anything. I had to throw a fair amount of ketchup to just get something out of it. I was really underwhelmed. The fires were very good. I felt like if they would have added some seasoning to the burger ingredients it would have been wonderful but it was like salt and pepper went missing. I was really sad because it looked and sounded really good.

Now, I will say the place itself is a cool pub atmosphere, it seemed like a fun place to throw back some beers, but the food just fell flat for me."}
{"text":"Gret food and service! I ate their steak salad 2 weeks in a raw. All other menu is great as well! Definitely a good restaurant."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I am a local to downtown Phoenix and i have gone here many times with my boyfriend. We have always had amazing service and delicious drinks. It is affordable as well. Always clean and welcoming. I will keep coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Get there early and convince yourself it's worth the wait because it is! 11 grape variety on the menu great selection of craft beers highly recommend popping in it was my first time and I will be back the next time I'm in downtown Phoenix"}
{"text":"William r...to bad your 'personal opinion' on music kept you from enjoying some amazing food in what I would say is a pretty cool atmosphere...  Here's a tip, if you haven't even tried the food, keep your opinions to yourself.  Having been in the industry, people put a lot of hard work and passion into their food and to have someone silly like you come along and bash a place because you didn't like the music...***** please...  Keep it to yourself. No need to hate on a place and try to tarnish a rating & reputation without even having tried it...  Are you a G & D employee and are sweating the competition?  Or just a crabby person who has to try to seem cool by putting others down???  Keep your reviews helpful and if you don't have anything nice to say, try saying nothing at all. They have amazing food and staff and you and your boys missed out..."}
{"text":"Bar was fine, food didn't look great but we didn't eat anything. Atmosphere wasn't great even after a game when the place should have been busy."}
{"text":"Warm atmosphere, friendly staff, fast service and good food makes this cozy pub a great place to spend an evening with friends."}
{"text":"Had the grilled flank iron steak salad.  Incredible!  Steak was tender, salad crisp--corn, red peppers, red onions--and the piece de resistance--the jalapeño ranch sauce!   Exquisite!   Wow--paired with local ScotchAle--what divine inspiration!"}
{"text":"I don't get this place.  It's cozy enough but that's pretty much where the good stuff ends.  They have a blackboard with  \"Craft beers\" but they really only have the standard Stone on tap and nothing too exciting in bottles either.  The food is pretty mediocre.  Not really would I consider gastropub fare.  The fish & chips came with the blandest coleslaw I've ever eaten and the chips needed life support.  I didn't even dare try what I could only guess was tartar sauce.  My buddy had a wrap which he described as meh.  The staff was nice enough but not nice enough for me to go back."}
{"text":"Love the entire decor and atmosphere! Haven't really seen many places like that in Scottsdale so it was a nice change. I got the corned beef which was absolutely delicious. My friend and I decided a little to late to do the bread pudding once the kitchen had closed but our super adorable and kind server, Michael, made it happen for us free of charge! Incredible service and amazing food"}
{"text":"Great pub atmosphere in the heart of downtown Phoenix. Ordered the crab cakes, hummus, sweet child wings, Philly cheesesteak fries, pork belly mac n cheese, and the bacon onion cheeseburger. Everything was delicious! Beer list was okay, but the server wasn't very familiar with what was available. She wasn't very attentive, either, which is why this isn't a 5 star review. We will certainly be back, and look forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"Got a recommendation to give this place a try and did so. Upon walking inside I noticed it had a cozy Irish pub atmosphere with beautiful wooden decor. I was greeted immediately by a friendly server. 
The server came back and explained the menu and gave us recommendations. We ended up ordering the wings that we had heard so much about. We got the medium and sweet chili. The wings were fried/ baked and we ordered the fish and chips with garlic fries. The food was very good and the service was top notch, our servers name was Wesley and he took excellent care of us. As for alcohol they have a full bar with plenty selection. They have a few tv with different types of sports playing and the music was a mix of 80's soft rock. I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Not the atypical bar food.  The chicken wings were so good we ordered a second helping!  The mussels are mouthwatering good!  Seriously the best I've ever had!  

I ordered the scallops and they were very good!  My companions ordered the Chicken kabobs and the flank steak and both of them killed it!  A true foodie experience! 

Phoenix you've got yourselves a homerun!"}
{"text":"Who told me to be near Downtown Phoenix during the Final Four.... I must have lost my mind but I was there.  After an amazing DBack game we decided to try something new.  

We walked into this hole in the wall pub and what a surprise..the owner was standing at the entrance and said we could be seated but the kitchen was closed... WHAT... He said they had so many customers today the kitchen was swapped...Yeah but I'm starving.  

As my girlfriend and I are pouring on the charm , he said Where are you from? To my amazment we were both from NYC.... YEAH....! We got a seat and we were able to order.  I was so happpyyy! 

The wait was a little while but it was worth it.  I ordered the fish and chips..... OMG... let's just say I ordered another one.  The fish was so flakey and the coleslaw was fresh.  I loved it... I mean I really enjoyed it. 

This place is an treasure to the downtown Phoenix area.   It's a breath of fresh air.  Listen this is a pub with great food and even better beer.  

Try this jewel!!!!"}
{"text":"We had originally stopped at another bar restaurant for dinner but I felt like I didn't want to eat there and saw that this place was right around the corner so we came here instead. Huge improvement! 

We start sat ourselves at the bar and the bartender helped us which I was impressed with because he was also filling all the other drink orders for the bar as well. We ordered two beers which he poured immediately and helped us with some questions with the menu. We ended up ordering the pretzel and the black bean burger. The pretzel came with a cheese dip and a crushed mustard seed dip. What I liked about the pretzel was that it stayed soft even after the pretzel had cooled off. Usually, they get hard. The cheese was phenomenal. It was creamy and a restrained cheese flavor that was good. I also dipped my fries into it. I'm not a super mustard person so not comments there. The black bean burger was good. The patty was nice and moist with really good flavor. I would describe the overall flavor of the burger as comparable to a really good meatless chili. I love meat and I enjoyed the burger so there's that. I really liked this place and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"So this review is in real time. 8:50pm on Sunday, February 19....

Sitting at the bar and watching the NBA Allstar game. Bartender is totally cool and on it. Welcomed me right away. 

Had the bacon onion burger and a beer and shot of Jameson. Burger was meh.. Not much flavor and several inedible pieces of grissle that was a turn off. Presentation of burger was just not functional.

Seems like a fun place to come and get shit faced with friends but I can do that for much cheaper that my local dive bar.

Just a Meh rating here folks."}
{"text":"\"You're the best\" this is a phrase only East coast people would understand and this holds true to The Kettle Black. Stumbled across the gem during the summer when it was 115 outside and have not stop thinking about it since! The ambiance is chill and super friendly. Mikeal is fun and very attentive so service is top notch. The food is excellent we had the chicken kabob and the dipping sauce is so yummy you could dip anything in it. (Sweet chili)  we also shared Citrus chicken salad which was light and refreshing. 
Do I recommend The Kettle Black? ... Hands Down!

Ps. Added benefit it feels like a place you'd find in NYC! But it's in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place by accident.  Nice little place.  Love the atmosphere.   The fish and chips was amazing.  Service was also great."}
{"text":"Best pretzel I've ever had! All food homemade in house! The bartender Billy is awesome and very informative.  Plenty of Irish coffee available! Great service!"}
{"text":"The Kettle Black was AMAZING. From the moment I walked in the decor was on point. I came during happy hour and was promptly greeted my my waiter, I ordered a drink and POOF it was there right away. We shared the Philly cheesesteak fries and oh my god they were delicious. I then ordered the bacon onion burger is was TO DIE for!!!! The service and atmosphere were what really took this place over the top! I will be back here for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Supposed to be an Irish  bar but no IRISH COFFEE wtf! Mussels were awesome iron steak not so great.  Service was on point!"}
{"text":"Really neat place! I sat at the bar and met some really nice people. The service was great and it was a fun atmosphere for watching the NCAA game. I had the wings but there were a lot of things on the menu that I wish I could have tried!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience with our dinner before a show at the Herberger.
Modern Pub with an urban patina. Good food, a delicious salad and one of the best turkey burgers we've had. But above all some of the best service We've experienced, really above and beyond good. From the front door to bus-person to our server, all great! A wonderful find thanks to Yelp."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch earlier this week with some coworkers. We were seated promptly (which was a good thing since we had limited time) and our drink orders were taken. I opted for the bacon burger with french fries. After reading some of the other reviews I was really looking forward to it. But to be honest I wasn't that impressed with it. It was OK but I've had much better burgers at other places. I had asked for medium rare and it came out a definite medium. The fries were good; however they could have been cooked a little longer in my opinion. One of the ladies I was with ordered the vegetable soup and was quite surprised to find chunks of chicken in it. This was quite a surprise as she's a vegetarian. The waitress was very apologetic and did end up taking it off her bill however."}
{"text":"Perfect for after a long day at the Convention Center. Pork belly sliders were amazing. Vibe was bar, relaxed, could enjoy some privacy in the booths that had plugs for charging up our phones (which we desperately needed!). Service was friendly and prompt. Happy to have found the place."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Good drinks, great service, and great food.  The pub pretzel is wonderful and the Reuben is on point.  Pre game it's here, happy hour, or just stop in while downtown and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great little pub! The burgers, sandwiches and pasta were all yummy. Great beer selection. Good service. Reasonable prices. Definitely would go back next time I'm looking for a burger downtown."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere; great service, friendly servers, delicious food and great drinks! 

Tried the pork belly sliders and they were phenomenal.

Great place to stop in in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Everything was really good, food and service. Had the coconut porter which was really delicious. Steak salad was also super tasty. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"The food is ok but overpriced. The place itself smells like an overload of burned grease. Their beers are pretty good which is why I gave it a three star rating instead of two."}
{"text":"I was working on a project and didn't watch the time.  When I was finished, most of the restaurants stopped serving food for dinner.  So I came over here, expecting slightly better than average late night grub.  

oooooweeeeeee!! 

The food is great, great, great!!!  A lot of good eats are on the menu so I picked the chicken kebabs and soup of the day (tomato beet soup) then topped it off with a cheesecake.   Gosh!   What a great meal! And, at a late night, too!   Then, I get the bill -- it is really reasonably priced for soup, entree, and dessert.  Everything is totally great!

The service is amazing, too!   My waiter was really attentive to my glass of water -- I kept downing the water like crazy because I'm from the northeast and not used to the dry heat oven-like temps here in Phoenix.  So after the second empty glass, he brings over a much larger glass of water -- that's pretty cool because the place was quite jumping with late night diners and drinkers.  It doesn't stop there.   During the time I was eating, the owner and then the chef stopped by the table to ask about the meal and if there was anything else I wanted.   Now that's darn great customer service. 

I know where I'm going the next time I'm in Phoenix, hungry for dinner, and it's past 9p.   I'm coming here!  Great ambience, great service, great food, no hole in my pocket afterwards.  Totally awesome dining experience!"}
{"text":"Steak salad was one of the best I've had.  The meat was cooked perfectly and the spicy dressing was super delicious.  This place has a great ambiance- it's unique for downtown.  Although it was busy for a Monday the service was excellent.  All in all a really positive experience!  I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Flew out to Phoenix for MLB spring training. After a long day in the awesome Phoenix sun we were looking for a good beer and some quality food. The Kettle Black did not disappoint. Right in downtown Phoenix and close to our hotel. The fish and chips were awesome and the beer selection was great. Harrison, our bar tender was a great guy, provided awesome service and welcomed two \"non locals\" would recommend this place for anyone staying near downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"This Phoenix place was OK as a gastro pub. The food was good. The draft beer selection was a mix of local and other brews. We came for happy hour on a Friday evening. The music was fairly loud rap music until 6:00pm, then changed to a more middle of the road selection after 6:00. The service was very good."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place with really good fish and chips! Really great place to hit after work or on the weekend. They have a good wine selection for a bar! Owner came to our table to make sure we were happy. Very great experience!!"}
{"text":"This FIVE STAR review is for one of the servers at The Kettle Black. His name is Stephen. My car broke down outside of The Kettle Black on Wednesday afternoon while it was 110 degrees outside. I had my 7 year old daughter with me and we had to call a tow truck. While we were waiting outside in the 110 degree heat for the tow truck to come (which somehow took 90 minutes), Stephen saw us and came outside and invited us to wait inside where it was cool. He also gave me a glass of ice water and my daughter a glass of lemonade. I offered to pay and he refused. The world needs more people like Stephen in it! He made a bad situation a little more bearable. Thank you to The Kettle Black and THANK YOU STEPHEN!"}
{"text":"We walked in last night around 10:30 pm, where we were met with a sign that said \"please wait to be seated\". We stood there for about 10 minutes, looking at the empty window seats, empty couple bar seats, trying to make eye contact with the staff, some of who even walked right past us without saying anything! We eventually just left because we felt completely invisible. Awful service."}
{"text":"This was an amazing find. The dear prudence is my new favorite cocktail, the bar tenders knowledge and recommendations were much appreciated. Had the giant pretzel with cheese and the palate punching grainy mustard... so delish and the fish and chips we're fried to perfection. Not greasy at all. We will definitely be back on our next trip down town"}
{"text":"The best meal I had in Pheonix!   Fantastic food, service and environment.    Just go!   Eat, drink and be merry!   I am going back the next time I visit Pheonix!"}
{"text":"Great food, great servers, great atmosphere. definitely going to come back! Alex was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is a block from the arena downtown Phoenix. Food is ALWAYS great and the atmosphere is cozy. Servers are friendly and helpful. I had amazing crab cakes... Really reasonable priced. Check it out!!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious food, and awesome bar selection. I'm gonna have to come back after hours to enjoy the craft beer selection. 

Had the blackened chicken sandwich for lunch with coleslaw. I would recommend this place for lunch or dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"Fish and chips was a solid pick.  Good selection of beer including Prairie's Vape Tricks sour.  Waters were constantly topped off leaving us quenched.  Our waited was attentive, and friendly.  
The Irish bread pudding wasn't swimming in sauce (that sauce tho) like it is at there sister location Tim Finnigans,but still delicious."}
{"text":"I was debating between giving this place a 3 or 4, and decided on 4 since they are brand new and have a lot of potential. We had a really friendly server who explained that their menu was not yet complete and they were still trying out new dishes and combos. My steak salad was perfect. My friend ordered a burger and said it was good but a bit too greasy. Worth a shot and hoping to be back to try their other menu items!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Good beers on tap. Good service. Good prices.  Excellent Reuben. I'll be back to eat more and drink more!"}
{"text":"I am an avid go-er to the ballet and symphony and this is the best place to go after. Literally. I never get tired of it. The bread pudding is probably the most amazing bread pudding I have ever had. I love their crab cakes... like love love love.... The burgers are pretty decadent, but lacks flavor. I use a lot of the garlic aioli ... their fries are really good- I drown them in the garlic aoli or the curry sauce. Overall, it is always nice to end my artsy fartsy evenings there. 

The interior is like an Irish bar had a baby with a hipster. 
The food is like sporty gastropub meets young hipster chef. 
So basically it is a young hipster chef who likes sports and is Irish."}
{"text":"After a long day at a conference, I was invited to join a group at the Kettle Black.  This is a nice place.  Great atmosphere, not too loud so I could hear everyone at my table.  A few games on the tv, and lots of people, but not crowded, on a Thursday night.  I had spicy wings, a large bavarian pretzel and 2 beers, all for about $25.  The wings hit the spot and the pretzel was homemade (i.e., not microwaved).  Overall, a fun night, and this place made it easy.  Would recommend the Kettle Black for any after work group outing."}
{"text":"We had less than 24 hours in Phoenix. Headed to Kettle Black after the Diamondbacks game, since it was nearby, and we were looking for American pub fare. Plenty of room to sit at the bar or at a table or hightop. Adam, our bartender, was wicked nice and friendly. The honey hot wings came recommended and were phenomenal. Was told that the garlic butter ones are even better. The burger and turkey burger were quite decent, hitting the spot. But, the corned beef stew is what will have us coming back whenever we're in Phoenix again. Definitely recommend visiting/eating here."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere. One of my favorite neighborhood hangouts."}
{"text":"Awesome new pub that just opened downtown! $5 house wines, good beer selection, incredible pretzel appetizer!!! 
Atmosphere: traditional English pub with modern flare 
Service: superb
Look for the big double red doors across from Hanny. 
This will definitely be a hot spot. Competitive prices and hip vibes."}
{"text":"Cute little pub with great food. And try the Middleton Very Rare Irish Whiskey. The staff is also great."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, ambiance, beer selection and staff!!! One of our new favorite places :) 
The philly fries are phenomenal, and their burgers have yet to disappoint! We've been twice now and both times we were promptly greeted by a friendly face within minutes of taking our seat; no waiting around even in very busy times. 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Appetizers and food was delicious at this restaurant however took forever it seemed to arrive. Where did Hummus as an appetizer and had the fish and chips as main course. Again food was great but the wait times were too long."}
{"text":"This place has a nice patio outside and lots of seating inside.  For any pub to get a 4 star rating in my book they have to do the simple things well, and that means great wings in this case!  Everyone in our party enjoyed our meal very much and the wait staff were friendly and efficient.   I look forward to hitting this place again next time I'm in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Decent beer selection. Got the buffalo chicken fries based on previous reviews, they were lackluster. Barely any chicken or bleu cheese and a lot of the fries were raw. Basically just halfway fried French fries slathered in buffalo sauce. Our server was nice but seemed in a hurry to leave. We didn't stay for more than a beer and we didn't finish the fries. The bar was neat and had a nice patio area. Would give it another try when they weren't so close to closing time."}
{"text":"Went on an impromptu date night with the Mr. upon recommendation from a friend of the owner. Found the place pretty easily since we are familiar with downtown. Close to the sports arenas which is nice. Was pretty busy when we walked in but were seated almost immediately. Was a baseball game night so it was pretty loud but fun. Nice little pub atmosphere. Family friendly for before the games. 
We decided on a couple craft cocktails and some appetizers.  Drinks were good.. i honestly don't recall which we tried...as for appetizers we had the mussels and philly steak fries. both were delicious. The fries are definitely not for the calorie conscious but if your gonna splurge this is the way to go no doubt. Our server was attentive, funny and helpful. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with some friends. Everything looked fresh and appetizing. Had the onion bacon cheese burger and it was great! Would recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome Irish Pub w amazing food. Fund n Chips awesome n the Phily Cheesesteak fries r the bomb! Billy is n AMA big bartender n will not steer u wrong!"}
{"text":"I love the location and the pub style interior.    The place is central to a lot of other stuff downtown, and makes a great stop on a night of bar hopping.   Also love the bench seats where you can dine and drink while spectating on the passers-by outside.   

I bookmarked the \"hot & new\" Kettle Black recently so after picking me up at Sky Harbor upon my 9pm return from an east coast trip, my wife promptly took me there on the way home.  En route, I called to determine if their kitchen was open late and to my relief (!!!!) they said I was good to go.   Really glad we decided to swing by for the evening.  

The \"Rueban\" and truffle fries were delicious.  This is one of the better reubens I've had in a while, not that I eat that many of them.   If you like reubens though, you'll really like this one.   It's a great choice on the menu.  The chips....er, truffle fries...were also really good, and ample.  Speaking of chips...er...fries :), love that you can get them done any one of 6 ways.  Overall, they have a nice dinner menu with a decent range of items to select from in the starters & salad arena, sammy/burger/wrap category, a few entrees, and an \"across the pond\" selection of a few British/Irish items including a couple of pasty choices.  

I like the menu.  There's lots here I would eat and it's perfectly fine that it's not 100% pure traditional British / Irish food.  I am totally down with the pub styling combined with the ability to get good American OR food from \"across the pond\".  

I had a couple of draft brews that were cold and hit the spot as well and subsequently went back for a second visit to meet a buddy for happy hour.   Great beer selection.  

Service was mediocre on my Sunday night dinner visit.   Bartender on my mid-week happy hour visit however was awesome and super friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped by when I was downtown the other day and grabbed a beer and some lunch. The Southwest Chicken Wrap was outstanding and the fries were seasoned perfectly! They have a few local beers on tap along with the typical big names!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal customer service with an excellent wait staff and incredible food with amazing drinks. I would highly recommend this place to anybody,it has something for everyone!!"}
{"text":"Not only is this a badass bar these guys know how to make a drink. Definitely a go to if you're in the downtown Phoenix area"}
{"text":"Wow this was amazing. The peppercorn steak was perfection and the service was the best. Loved the atmosphere and chance to just mingle and observe the local scene."}
{"text":"Working in Phoenix for the next few months, scouting downtown found kettle black.  Menu looks good went in to try the fish and chips.  Chips were crispy and perfect.  Fish was golden, crunchy and delicious.  No need to tartar sauce or malt vinegar.  Tried it with both, complimented well.  Fish was light and fluffy not too oily.  Service was friendly, I went for a late lunch so not too busy.  Atmosphere was comfortable.  I imagine this would be a great place to enjoy a pint.  Check it out.  Only drawback was the cobbler on Yelp was off the menu may head back to try it again.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Prices were reasonable great service. Our waiter was a super cool guy and knew the menu witch made it supper easy to order. Classy place, classy food, and drinks. It wasn't loud, I never felt rushed in fact we just wanted to chill and hang out even after our food and drinks were done. Me and my girlfriend really enjoyed this place next time we go to pheonix we will most certainly be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped by this joint and was not disappointed.  Great HH specials., and the food is awesome! Very reasonable and a great variety of whiskey/bourbon available.  Check this place out if you're ever walking around the downtown area."}
{"text":"We showed up and committed the cardinal sin of dining, arriving with a 12 top and no advance warning for the restaurant. Our group kind of grew last minute, was supposed to be four of us originally, and it wasn't really planned, but we were worried we wouldn't be able to find anywhere to seat us as it was Saturday night and busy everywhere. The owner (I think he was the owner?) was beyond gracious and accommodating and made it work for our group with only a brief delay to get us seated (which we would have been happy to wait as long as needed). 
Food and service at The Kettle Black was excellent and we were extremely impressed with how accommodating the staff were with what I know from experience is a major pain, large groups are never fun to host! Wait time for food was very much within the norms for busy dinner service, and no orders were incorrect or \"lost\". 

Service aside, the food was beyond excellent. The appetizers (we tried the cheese steak fries, the buffalo chicken fries, and the hot bavarian pretzels) were all very well done and large enough to share. The only suggestion I'd make for the restaurant is that the pretzels should come with just a bit more cheese sauce as that ran out pretty quickly. That said, the hot pretzel was probably one of the best I've had anywhere and I'm a sucker for a giant pretzel. 
Entres were just as good, 1st street burger was done to perfection and was very well flavored, and the pork belly mac and cheese was excellent. 
Beer selection was great and I really enjoyed the scotch ale and the maui coconut porter which is one you don't see everywhere. 
I'm not in phoenix much these days, but I'd come back here in a heartbeat! Though, if I have a large group next time I'll make sure to call in advance ;)"}
{"text":"Visited The Kettle Black for the first time this week and was pleasantly surprised. The ambiance and location are great, and the appetizers were very tasty! 

 Every restaurant has some growing pains along the way. Ours was some intermittent service delays - we had to get up from our seats and grab our own side plates, for example. But I chalk it all up the chaos of a grand opening and look forward to going back and upgrading my review to Five Stars when I try the entrees on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place, love our server Mikael ask for him he will make your experience worth it. Food is great as well as atmosphere"}
{"text":"Nice little bar in downtown Phoenix. Reuben sandwich was loaded with pastrami and came with delish freshly sliced fries.  We walked in at 11:30 with no one there and by the time we left it was packed. Nice assortment of tap, craft, and bottled beers.  Good prices too."}
{"text":"I happened to come in with my husband on a specials night. North Mountain Brewery was there and they had a special menu that included a food/beer pairing. Four courses and four beers for $40! It was worth every penny. Unfortunately, I didn't have anything that wasn't off that menu, but those seated next to had equally looking delicious food. They raved about it. 

The customer service was amazing!!! They ran like a well oiled machine. Our waitress, I wish I remembered her name (tall thin long haired blonde) was very friendly and attentive. The manager was constantly making the rounds and was really putting in the effort to make sure his customers were pleased. You can tell this location prides itself in not only their food, but their customer service. 
If this location has anymore special events like this, I would love to attend."}
{"text":"Very fun bar/ restaurant. Nicely decorated. Great service. Food was good. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I am not a picky eater but everything was not good. We're here on vacay. I get it's fight night but our service was not good at all.. I've had to ask 3 different waiters for a refill because our waiter only came to our table 4xs in almost 2hrs. I ordered a sirloin medium rare and came back extremely well done. And a white sangria, which tasted nothing like sangria. My boyfriend ordered chicken tenders and they brought him chicken tender wraps. Granted we said our complaints and the waiter did fix his mean and took my drink off the bill. Also Not once did a manager come ask us how or service was. We're from Vegas where they just opened a tilt a kilt, but because of our experience here, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Downtown Phoenix and we wanted to try a new place, the Kettle Black Kitchen seemed like a great place to get a beer. It was quite early so there was not that many people in the restaurant. The inside is very nice, there is a great Irish pub feel-like. The decoration of the place is well done, I love the bar itself. 
We actually sat at the bar and ordered a Stella, the keg was empty (not the bartender's fault of course). We had to wait quite a while for our first beer, but no big deal. Then later on, my husband ordered a second beer and to our surprise the bartender pour the rest of the pitcher of Stella in my husband's glass.. She actually used that pitcher at least 20 minutes before to get the keg started, she poured all the foam in the pitcher ... Why would you serve that pitcher into a glass for a customer when it had been sitting outside for quite a while already.. Of course the beer was flat so my husband had to order a new one.. That's probably why I am not giving them 5 stars, not very professional.
We got the Curry Fries, the fries themselves were very good however their homemade curry sauce tasted more like a soup.. 
Overall it was a nice place, we will be back for a drink and maybe try a main course or something. Hopefully, the Stella keg won't be empty!"}
{"text":"Really great place to eat before a sporting or music even nearby. The place was loud and crowded, but we got free tequila from a company rep and left with a buzz and free t shirts. Oh, the food. One of the better tasting steaks I have had in AZ. Well done, small for the money (it was a small sliced piece) but really no complaints about the food or service. Plus cold beer and free tequila shots. Great night!"}
{"text":"Awesome pub- needed this downtown. Great fish and chips for lunch, will try for drinks after work too. Low key atmosphere, really nice place to spend a lunch hour."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The decor and atmosphere are inviting and the service is even better! Our server was Michael, and he was extremely attentive and extremely friendly. Everything was delicious; but you must try the pretzels!!! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"First time here.  4 rating for the hospitality at the bar and the venue itself.  It's cozy with great music  We're craft beers drinkers and the staff behind the bar was extremely knowledgeable and offered us tastes.  Other venues near the downtown area scoff when you ask for a taste. One ale house charges after a few tastes.  I digress. Food was okay but not sensational but no complaints.  Enjoyed this visit."}
{"text":"The staff is great and the food is excellent. Great place to hang out. It's always a fun time at Kettle Black"}
{"text":"Outstanding service at the bar. They bartender was very friendly and super attentive. The fish and chips were top notch. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"NOT Hole in the wall!! A new quaint pub.  Has cool European pub feel. Food is great and reasonably priced. Good selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"Good option for after event eat spot but not spectacular as for choices or taste.  I found the menu reminiscent of a traditional neighborhood bar; tenders, wings & burgers."}
{"text":"This was one of the least welcoming experiences I have had at a restaurant. We walked in and the host was not very welcoming, the only table they had left was, in the words of the host, \"literally the worst table in the restaurant\" (which honestly was not that bad). Then they were out of all IPAs, and acted like we were sort of an inconvenience to be asking for a table or a beer. Overall, it was so unfriendly and awkward that we ended up just leaving."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We were greeted immediately as we sat down and my server had a drink in my  hand in less than 3 minutes of me entering. He was super friendly and helpful when we had questions about the menu and very attentive the whole night. The other staff was by often too and we felt quite welcomed throughout the whole experience.

The food was also amazing. I had the first street burger and my wife had the buffalo chicken fries. They were both easily in our top 10 meals this year. If you get a chance to go here do t pass it up."}
{"text":"The service was great!   We both had the fish and chips and really enjoyed it. The fish was very crispy, well-seasoned, and appeared to be freshly battered.  We were expecting parking to be a challenge, but there was available metered parking directly in front. Lovely red doors and comfortable booths!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop and have a couple beers and wings, basically pre-game. The beers were served at the perfect temperature and the wings were crispy with just the right amount of sauce. The celery also tasted very fresh."}
{"text":"Awesome!  An authentic Irish Pub but new, clean, has great craft beers, cocktails and food is excellent."}
{"text":"This a great place!!! Went in for lunch during a break in our conference at the convention center. Service was great, we needed to get in and out within an hour and it was done. I ordered the pork sliders. The meat was tender and full of flavor, you could taste a hint of wasabi but not hot or overpowering. We also got a pretzel, soft and chewy. Great for lunch, great food, nice decor and great service! Wholeheartedly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with a few friends on the 8th, but I've debated writing this review due to the fact it is a new business. After mulling it over, my experience deserved a write up. 

A friend had recommended the place, despite having only been there for a couple drinks and not having ordered off the menu. The restaurant atmosphere was alright. It was quaint, small, and cleanly. It advertises an Irish theme, but really felt like any run of the mill downtown spot. The restaurant was a little busy, but our server got to us immediately, and she was very professional and courteous throughout our whole stay there. Honestly, our service was probably the best part of our experience there.

In starting with drinks, when it came to drafts, they offered mostly domestics, while the craft beers were offered in bottles. The craft/international selection was small, but I could see them growing the list in the future.

I ordered the fish and chips at $13 for dinner. Which is very reasonable pricing for a downtown venue, but had I known what I was receiving, I'd have been better off at Captain D's than this \"gastropub\". 

We had waited roughly over an hour for our food to arrive at our table, and when it did, I experienced probably one of the most disappointing meals I've ever had. My plate had a medium portion of fries, a spoonful of coleslaw, one portion of fish the size of a schoolchild's fist, and a side of \"special\" tartar sauce. Everything, I mean everything, was bland. Vinegar couldn't help the fish, salt couldn't help the fries, the coleslaw tasted like they TRIED to remove flavor from it, and the \"special\" tartar sauce tasted like they squeezed it out of a Heinz bottle. Around the table, there were various murmurs from the rest of my group that their food was either disappointing or just OK. 

I understand that restaurants have their bad nights, and it seems that a lot of people have had decent experiences here, but I was absolutely taken aback by how disappointing this place was. Also witnessed that night, a waiter dropped a burger onto a ladies purse and she was picking out toppings from it for awhile, and a man was delivered a chicken sandwich, in which they did not put the chicken into the sandwich, because the chef was \"unsure if he wanted it or not.\" It's going to take a lot of convincing to get me back to the Kettle Black again."}
{"text":"I live downtown and have walked past this place several times. I came in in a slow Saturday and was pleasantly surprised.  I sat at bar and the tender actually looked me straight in the eye. This is the type of place you go to if you want to become a regular Bc the staff is actually seeing you. Ordered the crab cakes and a beer. I like cold glasses, mine was not. A cold glass would have accelerated my review but the beer was cold. The crab cakes were awesome. Served with greens for $10. That's a $15 appetizer anywhere else. I like the staff. I felt comfortable. Good quality. Try it. You will like it."}
{"text":"Loved this place. After spending a couple days in Phoenix for work with a slew of bad restaurant experiences, this pub hit all the marks. Ambiance is casual and homey. Food was awesome. Pretzel with cheese sauce, pork belly sliders and garlic fries with aioli for dipping. Don't think you can go wrong with anything from here. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Took my fiance on her first walk around in central phx this weekend, and ended up in this place. She wanted gastro pub fare, and we weren't disappointed. Kettle offered the menu and ambiance of your standard millennial fueled gastro pub, but boasted much more reasonable prices. We had the crusted ahi tuna salad, pork belly sliders, crab cakes, and bread pudding for dessert.

The portions were plentiful, prices reasonable. The pork belly itself was the best part of the meal, not too sweet and not too fatty. The crab cakes were dense with crab meat, and paired nice with the spring greens it came nestled in. The ahi tuna salad was good, but the tuna was a little over cooked (ahi tuna turns into leather in the blink of an eye). Bread pudding was classic, but had an exceptionally good texture. 

I contemplated 5 stars, but the overcooked tuna was a bummer. And the bread of the pork belly slider was a little dry. Long story short, definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Loved my solo business travel dinner experience here! The only slight negative came on first impression when the host told me up front \"sit anywhere you want\" but when I picked a booth, he later asked me if I was solo and then asked me to move their smallest table. It was a bit awkward dining alone in the back middle of the pub but the service, food and beer made me soon forget that. The place has a cool British pub atmosphere which you can see from all the pics.

My server was Misty and I highly recommend anyone ask for specifically when she's on shift here. Their drinks list is extensive with seasonal draft beers changing all the time. Based on my inclinations for dinner Misty suggested the North Mountain Scotch Ale on draft. My water was delivered quickly and soon after the beer. One sip and I knew why it's their most popular brew. It's a fantastic non-hopped ale - this coming from a guy who loves hoppy IPAs. Misty was a true menu ambassador and offered crab cakes as a lighter appetizer since I knew I would try their well-reviewed fish & chips for the main course.

The crab cakes come with a lightly dressed salad for roughage. When they put it down in front of me I was worried by the really dark (looked burnt in the dim lighting) top and bottom crust. Once I tipped into it with my fork and tasted it all my worries went away. Delicious - superbly seasoned and it seems their hot pan sear strategy for the breading pays off with a more moist interior and crunchy crust.  I wasn't ready for the heft of a Porter or Oatmeal Stout for my second beer so Misty told me to try the Sentinel Peak Salida del Sol amber Mexican beer. Another solid suggestion! It is the most flavorful Mexican beer I've tasted, Negro Modelo included.

So now it was time for that famous fish & chips. Misty mentioned the fries can be served with their interesting house-made curry sauce. Other reviews are right - the focus is not the chips (fries.) They are tasty but not super crispy but the curry sauce makes a wonder dip. Remember curry sauce is a very British thing and not like real Indian food. It goes great with gastropub fare. The real Atlantic Cod fillet was fried beautifully with a crispy crust and moist, flaky but firm meat. By this time I was full so couldn't polish off the entire filet. This establishment is best enjoyed with friends or co-workers sharing plates. The place was pretty hopping for a Monday night as well. Highly recommended!"}

{"text":"Really good spot for lunch,  they also have a full bar, service is excellent and food extraordinary.
I got the Reuben sandwich and a barbarian pretzel  they were great, cheese and dijon on the side of the pretzel and a cup of cole slaw were just perfect.  Will definitely recommend it and come back!"}
{"text":"I certainly can't complain here! Relatively comfortable barstools, pub-like interior, and a great location. 

In an effort to curb my hangry-ness, we stopped into Kettle Black for what I was thinking would be fish and chips, because I sometimes judge a book by its cover. We took a seat over at the bar and chatted with the bartender a bit. Turns out they were amidst happy hour and my fish and chips fell by the wayside for the highly recommended Philly cheesesteak fries. Super filling and really tasty. We got them with a side of hot sauce, which was definitely the way to go."}
{"text":"My wife and I were walking around downtown and stumbled across this place. Great food. The Pretzel with ground yellow mustard was amazing. The Fish and Chips were done perfectly. Great crispy batter not greasy."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice, both times the service was incredible and the food amazing. Michael was our server on BOTH occasions! He is an exceptional server and his food and beverage recommendations are on point. This visit we had the Rueben, Turkey burger, and the Philly Cheese steak fries! The food came out VERY quickly, was fresh, and tasted amazing. Worth the drive, food comes out quickly, never a wait (on either of our visits)."}
{"text":"It certainly represents, quality, variety, service, all what you would expect!

Prices could be improved (as well as web presence)."}
{"text":"Although we only had a drink the place was packed and had a great vibe!  Walking distance from The Valley and Hanny's and Talking Stick Arena.  The pretzel and wings looked awesome."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for the weekend and The Kettle Black is just down the street from my hotel.  Checked out the reviews and decided to give this place a try for dinner and drinks tonight.  So happy that we decided to stop in, as this place is a gem!  Upon recommendation from our sever, we ordered the Stone IPA...YUMMY!  Excellent choice!  Also ordered the steamed muscles, crab cakes, and caprese salad and it was super delish!  My husband ordered the steak with string beans, and mashed potatoes, and he said that was really good too!  My only complaint is they only  1 dessert on the menu.  Not a fan of bread pudding, so we didn't order it.  So happy we stumbled upon this place though.  Definitely coming back on my next trip to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in here while waiting on the start of a show and I'm so glad we did! It was a nice casual atmosphere and the staff was all really friendly. I ordered the pork belly sliders and they were delicious!! The pork belly was cooked perfectly and the hint of cranberry on the sandwich complemented the pork so well. I ordered the coleslaw for a side and I'm quite picky about coleslaw (I know, weird) but it was really good. 
My friend raved about her chicken sandwich, as well. 
I'll be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Came here after the Dodgers beat the Diamondbacks, its within walking distance from Chase Field so that was an obvious pro. Didn't get to try any of the food, but the drinks were great. I had both the Rose and Poblano and the Dear Prudence, which were probably the best drinks I've had at an establishment. 

The place itself was chill, it wasn't too packed (probably because it was a Thursday) and the ambience is relaxing. Music isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Coming to Phoenix once a year doesn't give me much time to try out many restraunts but this is one of my favorites. Great food and drinks, an amazing staff and fun atmosphere. Try the Bacon and Onion Burger and Ruben...great! The Corner Bodega is a great drink!"}
{"text":"I first want to say that the staff are not only incredibly kind and helpful but the food and drinks are amazing! I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone for a great meal! The  hospitality is exceptional! I left my bag at the restaurant and the staff went above and beyond to ensure it was returned safely -- they even went to the UPS store to ship it out to Sedona. I'm truly amazed. Thank you a million times!"}
{"text":"The thing is I am truly ashamed to say, I never noticed it until it happened to me.  My husband who is white and I went all the time...everything was great.  My son ( who is of color) went with me and and WOW, my blinders are off.  Listen, don't believe me, see for yourself the lack of diversity of the people working there.  Heartbreaking, a. this still happens 2. here comes the talk with my son... AGAIN! 

My son walked in before me and a. All of a sudden no one under 21 is allowed - a lie. b.  We came from Cornish Pasty down the street (which was cool) and had leftovers and they needed to check it for drugs... COME ON NOW.  

Makes me sad, rea


It was 7 pm on a Sat- 3-17-18.  The only black/African American guy working there was the bouncer.  He wanted to apologize but the blonde guy(who always works the door) would not let him.   Come to think of it, yeah there is one latino: the buss boy.  Look, all that aside I understand a policy but to state you need to check leftovers for possible drugs is ridiculous.  You see my son walked in 1 minute before me, so the bouncer and the blonde didnt realize he was with me.  It was never an issue of age, he is 20, but when I said hey that's my son it became a thing about no kids allowed.  Either way, ask your staff.  You think people take the time to write reviews because things went right?

I am working hard to be not to harsh or name call - but this was not right.  As far as that drink and chat go, I appreciate the offer and will think on it.  Thanks for the reply."}
{"text":"We went for the kitchen and passed on the pub.  The kitchen definitely delivered on taste, portion sizes and presentation, loved the cutting board plates.  Three out of our party of four ordered beef burgers and raved.  I had the turkey burger and it was pretty good, a tiny bit dry but the onion roll grilled with butter and the other fixins rounded it out and it worked very well.  Truffle fries won the majority vote.  Never knew teenage girls would appreciate a sophisticated burger but they surprised me with their mature palates. Atmosphere, service and decor all added to the kitchens hands-work, one of the party of four did notice that there were not one black kettle in sight. Although we live a bit out of the way to be regulars, we would definitely  come back on another trip downtown."}
{"text":"Delicious food, cold drinks, comfortable atmosphere...I love this place. 

I just got back from eating dinner here and I couldn't wait to share my experience. I ordered a Strongbow cider, which arrived crisp and cold in a matter of minutes. For my entree, I ordered the Corned Beef & Cabbage with mashed potatoes and an onion demi sauce.

Now, it needs to be said that this dish in general is my favorite, but only the way my mom makes it. Time and time again, I have ordered it in the hopes of getting remotely close to the deliciousness of my mom's corned beef and cabbage. 

They have all failed...until now. It was AMAZING. The corned beef was tender and didn't have too much fat on it, the mashed potatoes were creamy and fluffy, and the cabbage was cooked to perfection; buttery and slightly meaty without overpowering the cabbage flavor. It was all wonderful. I wanted to keep shoveling it into my mouth but sadly, there is only so much room in my stomach (the foodie's Achilles heel) and I had to get some boxes (yay leftovers!).

The servers were friendly and accommodating, the ambiance was relaxed and comfortable, and the food was delicious. The Kettle Black, do NOT change this dish, I beg of you. It is the best I've had and I'll be damned if you take it away from me!"}
{"text":"We planned a night out in Downtown Phoenix and decided to give this place a whirl for dinner. Everything on the menu looked amazing, but I was trying to be good so I ordered the Steak Salad. It was quite delicious. We also ordered a Bavarian Pretzel and and Garlic Fries for the table which were also amazing! I love the decor and the atmosphere of this place and will definitely return next time I'm in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to end our evening out this past Saturday and made our way through Diamondback traffic to land at Kettle Black. We called ahead to check on the wait and were told we could get right in, when we got there the person who greeted us told us it would be a 30+ minute wait. After we explained the manager the misunderstanding he found us a table immediately and asked the waiter to take extra good care of us. We had already eaten so we mostly had drinks. Just the customer service experience alone impressed me and created a customer for life!"}
{"text":"Service was outstanding but that is where it ends. I was figuring with all the great reviews this place was worth the stop. I don't know if the people writing the great reviews have never had good cuisine but the food here was bad, really bad. I had Caprese Stuffed Chicken which was overcooked and had an incredibly weird texture, like eating cartilage.  Yuck! It was drenched in sauce. Very disappointing.  The place was swarming with fruit flies which is never a good sign. We had to keep swating the fruit flies away the entire time and we were not near the bar! Cleanliness is an issue. The beer tasted old and flat (fruit flies all over the beer). In my opinion it is best to keep your distance.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"OMG ... DT Phx. It's kinda a happening place. I had a New castle on tap and it was actually good (great even) fresh healthy and crisp. The food came SUPER fast and was excellent (I got the chicken wrap)... tasty and decent price.
 They had a DJ - an actual DJ who was mixing music live (like working it for real). I'm just outside the millennial age cut off, but the music was incredible (mad skills on the DJ).
 On my quest to find the best bar in PHX ... this just moved to the top of my list. The beers are not the cheapest, but it's worth coming to this place."}
{"text":"Was craving a burger and stopped in tonight with my boyfriend. Bartender was very friendly and accommodating. 

Split their typical burger with garlic aioli and a fried onion ring. It was one of the best burgers I've ever had. 

Shared the Philly cheesesteak fries. So. Good. 

Not a huge beer selection but the ones they had were local and good.

Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Good service. The one item I had was excellent. The steam mussels were so tasty. Garlic. Oil. Chorizo. White wine. Yum!  The bread it came with was nice and toasty. Great dipper in the sauce.

The place is really cool.  Warm and dark. In a good way.

It was a hot day so I had a beer. Cocktails I have them on cooler days."}
{"text":"What a cute little establishment. The staff was absolutely incredible! They gave us their opinions on their favorites off the menu, they were upbeat and joked around with us. We came in with a rather large party and were pretty loud, not once did we get a sideways glance from anyone. The staff joined in on our celebration. We loved the service so much we came back both days were were in town. Thank you Kettle Black, you made our trip to Phx that much better"}
{"text":"Had lunch here and started with the pretzel appetizer served with a side of white cheddar cheese sauce and mustard; hands down the best pretzel I have ever had . You must order the pretzel I promise it will not disappoint!  Pork belly sliders, the pastrami rueben, and the chicken wrap were all good, as well as the service."}
{"text":"A variety of beer and a great gastropub to be at!

I like the above-the-notch bar entrees and pub surrounding! 

Mussels broth was a bit salty, but that's why there's the bread to tip it into to counterbalance the sea salt flavor!  

Wings were spot on.  The steak could have been better with the sauce. I didn't care too much on the black bean sauce and the steak was a bit tough in terms of texture for a medium rare.  Well done on cooking it to perfectly medium rare though! 

I adore the beer selections and service was nice. 

Now, I wonder why it's named kettle black?"}
{"text":"The Garlic fries are amazing and we really enjoyed our cocktails. I just wish it wasn't as packed so we could sit inside."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Nothing really spectacular. Place was full of drunken losers when we were there. Insanely loud. Wasn't even a Friday or Saturday. Sunday, midday I believe. I can eat at better places in the valley and enjoy myself much more."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp during a quick trip to Phoenix.  It's a small restaurant with a nice vibe.  We were immediately greeted, and we were served water while we perused the menu.  The service was fast and friendly throughout our meal.

I ordered the reuben, and my husband ordered the wasabi caesar salad.  I love reubens and order them regularly at restaurants.  This reuben was pretty sad.  The meat was thinly sliced and pretty bland.  There was the tiniest amount of 1000 Island, and the tiniest amount of sauerkraut.  Not bad, just nothing memorable.

My husband's salad was also disappointing.  Billed as a wasabi caesar salad, it was made with greens instead of romaine, and it had NO wasabi taste at all.  It was so odd, he actually asked the server if he got the right item.  She was really sweet and explained that it was a \"different style\" caesar.  She asked if he wanted something different, but he didn't.

Odd experience.  Not terrible, just not enticing us to go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was close to the convention center and much better than any food I'd find at the trade show.
     Even though it was very busy for a Saturday afternoon, I found a seat on a high top. Service was attentive and the Fish and Chips were excellent."}
{"text":"I have never made a negative post before. I won't come back ever again. Came in to grab a quick bite before going to the ballet on Valentine's Day with my date and our waitress killed our vibe. She was very unpleasant to my date and messed up a simple order. Was not pleased."}
{"text":"Great variety not your typical Bar food. We shared a couple dishes they have gluten free, healthy as well as your bar standards. Easy place to take people who are not always easy to please."}
{"text":"Went here last night for drinks after finishing up our day at comicon.  The a/c must have been broken because it was miserable inside. Did notice they had a fan up towards the door. Service was good, but it being cooler outside than inside was a laugh."}
{"text":"Was so excited when I heard this place opened.  Went in around 2pm, not busy at all...which was ok because we were just killing the afternoon.  Ordered a Half n Half...waitress asked if I wanted that with Magners???  I asked if they Harp or Bass...answer NO.  Ummmm are you kidding me?  Never been to an Irish pub that didn't have Harp. WTF?  I'd probably go back, but unless they get their act figured out I'll hit Seamus for more authentic feel."}
{"text":"Amazing meal in downtown Phoenix: outrageously cool waiters and quaint surroundingsCall and ask for the artesian salad with chicken awesome cold and just write call and can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Best. Place. Ever! Came for dinner before the baseball game tonight. Cutest pub with top notch service. We all agreed that the people who work here are some of the best we've experienced at a restaurant! They are welcoming and on top of everything!"}
{"text":"What a great place .  Service was excellent and very friendly staff.  Got there a little late and had some of there fantastic appetizers Looking forward to going back again."}
{"text":"The 1st street burger was super delicious. Also, the clams appetizer has a great sauce!

One must definitely try the pork belly mac and cheese if you're going here.

Lastly, don't forget to try their chili cheese steak fries!"}
{"text":"Party of 3, sunday 345 pm. We waited about 35 after we placed our order for our fries (app). And the meals took approx 43 minutes to come out. Service was ok, average . The place was clean and nice. Location was great. The food was slightly above average, but not great. My wife loved her black bean burger, I didnt like my sliders, and the mother in law liked the fries, but thats about it. Overall not a fan. I give it an honest 1.5 stars"}
{"text":"Great fish and chips! Loved the mood of the restuarant. The decor and bar made it feel like it was in Europe. They did a great job with their menu. The service was excellent! I'm so glad I went with the fish and chips, because they were delicious. Would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Visited here twice this weekend- once for the Urban Ale Tour and then again for dinner. Hands down, best service I experienced during my Phoenix trip. Bar staff, wait staff, owners were all superb, especially as it was amazingly crowded. 

The food and beer were great, highly recommend you do not leave without trying the Bavarian Pretzel."}
{"text":"First time at this pub. The staff was very friendly and helpful with select a dark beer choice. I had the fish and chip,the fries were Soft and not the best. Iwill return and try something different."}
{"text":"All around great spot. Corned beef and cabbage is one of my favorite dishes, and I tend to be very finicky with time honored staple.  I was beyond satisfied - they really knock it out the park - Cabbage was full of flavor, and corned beef tender. Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Great wait staff. Great food. Had the steak salad. Not too loud will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful he in the wall. Not fancy, very comfortable. Wonderfully friendly bartender. I had the chicken club. So good! Garlic mayo, fresh avocado on sourdough bread. Packed with flavor. My friend had the Reuben an d lived it! Great fries."}
{"text":"At first I wasn't sure... I'm not really for the overly packed, overly hyped downtown spot but I'm glad I stuck it out. Excellent food, tasty IPA selection, great service & beautiful surroundings."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Superb! Perfect 10 out of 10 if you like gastropubs!
Service: We sat right at the bar and was served by the bartender. The service was prompt, no complaints there.
Food: The fries with curry was amazing! I had the sesame crusted ahi tuna salad. The dressing was delicious, but it was heavy on the crunchy noodle side, making it just a tad too dry. Other than that, still a very memorable salad."}
{"text":"CJ, JAMES, STEPHEN, AND KELSEY took such good care of us! 30 people at least over the course of 4 days! Great food great drinks great service great people and the owner Jay!!!! Awesome!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tucson residents loved it here! We had the pleasure of enjoying some drinks here before our comedy show with Katt Williams last weekend and we had a fun time! Everyome must try a shot of Patron Anejo chilled.  Our waitress was professional and on top of her game... No long wait times, great drink recommendation/options! We will definitely continue to return back here in the future!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection but everything I ordered was in a can and not draft. Loved their crab cakes but the rest of the food left much to be desired. The chicken wrap was a glorified hand held salad with minuscule chicken. We also ordered fish and chips where the fish was good but the fries were a shade of gray (still tasted fine).

I love the interior decor and feel to this place. In the future I'll stick to apps and drinks. Service was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"ound this place through your platform since I'm a first timer here at The Kettle Black Kitchen in Phoenix AZ. Easy to find, and friendly staff. Both food and drink options had great verities with a twist of tradicional American favorites, the service was excellent by John"}
{"text":"The vibe is a hipper Seamus McCaffreys or George and the Dragon meets gastropub

It was super busy when we came in but we only had to wait a few minutes before the manager cleared some spots for us. Since we're talking managers. I've gotta message for this one. Man you've gotta chill! I think he chugged some red bulls, because he was around pretty frantically. Don't get me wrong, super nice, probably gave me about seven arm squeezes...but simmer down please.

We both ordered the tequila mojito cocktail equivalent. Way too sweet. Should've listened to the bartender when he said he didn't like the cocktail list. There was a lot of fried dishes on the menu. So we opted for the chicken kebab for a splash of healthiness. It was awesome the chicken was moist, and the green beans on the dish were drenched in heavenly garlic. The Pork Belly Sliders were not as grand. The meat was overdone and it didn't melt in your mouth like that fatty slider demanded. The sweet Chile sauce was a bit too sweet. I'll be back though, plenty more dishes to try."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE the entire experience at The Kettle Black. I enjoyed the garlic aioli fries that were out of this world. Service was outstanding...I will gladly drive the 45 min plus to recieve the quality and perfection that was given to me at TKB."}
{"text":"Super cool bar. Madison was great behind the bar. I requested flank steak w arugula salad (chicken was offered on the menu) and they were fine with it. Salad was good as was steak. Just shy of a 4 for me. Had to round to a 3. Might go back for drinks tonight..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during a convention. It was okay - better than most other stuff near the convention center.

Pros: Food was good, large alcohol selection but not really any specials.

Cons: Very limited menu. Service was adequate but not exactly friendly.

We will probably try to find other new places to try next year but this place is cool."}
{"text":"What a great lunch spot! I was headed through Phoenix around 12:30 in the afternoon on a Tuesday and happened to drop in. The food was great, I had the steak salad and was very pleased with the freshness of the vegetables. The steak was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Our waitress Brooke (sp?) was very sweet and extremely knowledgeable about the menu. They had a good selection of local beers and the dunkel I had was delicious. I had a great all around experience and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick and delicious business lunch."}
{"text":"Loved everything. Food was good, drink was good. Service was good. Nice atmosphere and ambiance. Order the Buffalo wing blue cheese loaded fries, excellent! And the 1st st burger was amazing!"}
{"text":"I had a good time here.  Great ambiance and service.  I feel bad but I have to give it 4 stars.  Reason being is that if you are going to do great food, then use great ingredients.  I ordered the Ruben since I have not had one in a long time.  They use slice cheap cheese almost like American but white on it and makes the whole sandwich feel cheaply made.  I'll still be back but I will be much more weary on what I order food wise."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and my oh my- what a great suprise!  The fish and chips and Ruben were all amazing.  Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here today!  My server was super friendly and she took good care of me!  I had a Reuben sandwich and coleslaw, it was quite good! The Wren House Senor Gallo was a tasty beer.  I recommend you stop by for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great location, great decor, cold beers, and tasty burgers. It doesn't take much more than that to make this boy happy. And this boy was happy. 

I stumbled into this place while in town for business, trying to escape the 100+ degree heat. Thank God it wasn't a mirage. It was a real oasis. 

Plain and simple: I loved the cozy/rustic decor, my burger was great, and they have Magner's on tap. I was able to order a light beer, a dark beer, and some cole slaw to slap on top of my burger. It was all great and I left happy. The location is very convenient as well. I would swing by again if in the area. Thanks, Kettle Black."}
{"text":"Great little place downtown. Nice vibe when you walk in and centrally located. I walked over from the Hyatt Regency where I was stating for the night. My wife and I both ordered apps and some drinks. I started with the Honey Hot buffalo wings and they were SO good. Perfect flavor, level of heat and crunch. My wife had the hummus and pita and it was very good as well. Beer prices were just whatever..typical for a downtown bar. We both had a couple stellas then moved on to scotch. Some Glenmorangie 10 year and MaCallan 12. I of course got mine neat and was surprised they charged us an extra $1 to have my wife's on the rocks. Seriously, you charged me an extra $1 to put ice in her drink? Lol other than that we had a good bartender and a good time. I'll go back next time I'm downtown."}
{"text":"Environment: This place has a nice environment. Not too loud and good spacing. 

Service: Our server was fabulous. He was enthusiastic and knows the menu very well. His recommendation were great as well. 

Food: The food was great. Everything tasted fresh and coming out hot. The buffalo chicken fries was my favorite (recommended). 

Price: The price of the entrees weren't bad. It was about $11-15. The buffalo fries seems to be a bit overpriced at $10 a serving. Granted the portion size was decent, it's hard to imagine the product cost to surpass $4 for them to charge $10. 

Overall: The experience of this meal was great. Would probably revisit sometime in the future."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been impressed enough to feel compelled to create a yelp account and leave a review.  The bartenders were all really cool.  Place has a very competent selection of beer and liquor.  And...Quite honestly, too tired (maybe intoxicated) at the moment to leave an in depth, coherent review,  so I'll leave it at this: if you're in Phoenix, looking for something to do, I'm positive you can't go wrong by coming here."}
{"text":"First time here. I expected greasy pub food but was pleasantly surprised! Good portions. My wife had the arugula salad and I had the scallops. Excellent! 
The host and service was excellent."}
{"text":"When you are wandering around downtown looking for a place where you haven't eaten lunch and you run int TKBK&P, count your blessings.  So glad I decided to stop in.  I've been in a lunch rut and TKBK&P helped me out of it.

Sat at the bar and watched Champion's League football, so I started off happy.  The service was fast.  The space was comfortable.  The food was pretty good too.  

I enjoyed my reuben.  Not the most tender corned beef, but pretty flavorful.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I decided to reserve seating for 15 to celebrate my father in law to be and fiancés birthday. When we arrived to set up we were greeted by Brook who was really sweet, as she walked us over to our table and we began to decorate for the party. During the few hours, we spent there Brook was very attentive and offered suggestions on the food and drinks. I decided to order the buffalo chicken fries and others ordered the fish and chips along with the burger. I must say all of their food was delicious and we had no complaints at all. I want to recommend anyone in the area to try this place because it is awesome. I wish all places can provide the type of customer service and care we received that night. THANKS AGAIN BROOK!"}
{"text":"Slowest. Service. Ever. Seriously. The food is really good (corned beef & cabbage soup, curry fries), but you literally need to wait an hour for it. An hour. Maybe more. Server didn't apologize or recognize that it took forever. Holy cow we waited SO LONG! Other table with a lot of people warned us. Place isn't even that big. I hope they figure out the timing soon. Like I said, the food was really good and was what prevented them from 2 stars. It's a Monday, btw."}
{"text":"Kettle Black is a great addition to downtown. Love the interior, and the food has all been great. Service at the bar is a bit better than the service at the tables.

Food-wise, I really liked the fish and chips. Obviously it's fried, but it still feels light and not greasy. I also liked the pretzel + cheese, but can you really go wrong with carbs and cheese? Pork belly sliders a solid choice as well. They look small but are super filling and flavorful. The chicken kebabs are good too, and a great option when you're trying to be a bit healthier.

I think the prices are also great considering the amount and quality of the food. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were great, the service was as good as it could be. I think the place is still new and possibly the staff too. There were a couple hiccups with our order, and then wrong checks being paid for. But all of this was corrected and the manager I believe brough our whole table a round of yummy shots to make it up :) 
We will def come back when we are in downtown phoenix again."}
{"text":"Great service, food, vibe and the DJ played good mix of music on a Thursday night. The staff is on point-filling waters, approaching us with menus and waters as soon as we sat. The wings honey hot was so good. The chicken kabob and the pork belly sliders were pretty good as well. Definitely would come here again. Keep up the great service!"}
{"text":"I found this place off of Yelp and wanted to try it based off of positive reviews. I was disappointed with the food, which came out cold, as well as the sub-par service. I ordered the fish & chips and was not happy with what I got (especially since pictures looked good)."}
{"text":"If you're at a conference in the downtown Phoenix area, this is a good option-- especially during the summer as the AC is strong. Friendly service, reasonable prices, and good food. I was a bit irritated that I couldn't get the chicken wrap because they were \"out of field greens\" (no offer to substitute), and I was served french fries instead of coleslaw, but overall it was a good experience. I was especially impressed with the draft beer selection."}
{"text":"This was awesome . First time the other night great service by Wes ....the short ribs and pork belly sliders we're amazing"}
{"text":"Went to the KBC after a long day.  It is a real old school bar.  Sat down and ordered a dink and the bar tender treated me like an old friend.  

I ordered the philly cheese fries.  Wish there was a little more meat on the plate but nevertheless it was tasty.  I could have stayed all night but I had already been up 20 hours.  

This place is old school cool.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went there at about 8:00 last Friday night, a little busy. While waiting for our table for 4, we sat at bar to grab some cocktails and drafts. Bartenders took awhile to take our drink orders, and then again for the next round. Good thing we got seated because the servers redeemed the experience with friendliness. Buffalo fries were the rave when the burger wasn't."}
{"text":"Service is always on point. Every employee greeted me within 30 seconds of walking through the door. The food is amazing & the prices are reasonable. The pork belly sliders are on of my fav's, along with the pretzels. If you like a dipping sauce for your fries, the garlic aioli is really good. I'll definitely continue to frequent this place. New downtown favorite!"}
{"text":"Pub grub, tap beer, and more! Convenient location just a stone's throw from Symphony Hall and next to one of my favorite coffee shops, Cartel Coffee. Better selection of darker beers than most places including some harder to find ones like Grooving with a Pict and Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, but of course there's the venue appropriate Guinness in all its endearing splendor.  The tender greens of the steak salad were the perfect bed for the tender rare steak that was cooked to perfection. I only intended to have one order of wings, but they were crisp and flavorful so couldn't resist, but they should have had a better mix of the drumettes and the other part of the wing, since one time I got all drumettes and the other time I got only two, so that was strange.  One doesn't usually mention celery esp. since it's usually curled from overlooking to make up for freshness, but these were fresh and not a brown end to be seen--could use more than the 3 small pieces though please. The other meals served around us looked delicious too: I spotted crispy fries and shiny-topped and plump sliders. Mikeal P. our server was a delight--helping with beer selections, never rushing us, AND able to answer my probably annoying questions about whose photos were on the walls (soccer stars and overseas politicians are not my strong suite)--bless him! However, there was one flaw for us and that was that the outdoor seating seemed to be set up for drinks only and the inside was so packed that the noise level was so high as to make our conversation very challenging. Maybe it was the lower tin ceilings or the narrowness of the room, so I might try another location than in the back near the bar, or try at different time of day...."}
{"text":"Happy hour and great atmosphere for our Friday afternoon. Great spot Jay. Thank you again!"}
{"text":"I was craving a Reuben on St. Patrick's Day, and somehow, that's hard to find when everyone has a limited menu, but The Kettle Black saved our night.

It was crowded and loud (I blame that on the holiday) but the sandwich was good and the server was quick and polite."}
{"text":"This is a great eatery with a fantastic bar feel... or is it a great bar with a fantastic eatery feel.  I don't know.  The Samson special was perfectly cooked and was almost out shined by the balsamic vegetables that came with the meal. 

I highly recommend this bar/eatery for meals and drinks.  In fact, I brought associates to hang out here the following evening!"}
{"text":"Irish pub located walking distance of Talking Stick Arena became a focal point for the night as we were looking to get a good bite to eat and previously tried this after seeing the Bruno Mars concert just weeks before.

The atmosphere is cool with televisions around, high top tables & chairs, along with a bar with just about everything you would expect from a pub.

On the menu we had the Philly cheesesteak fries and buffalo chicken fries as appetizers and for the main course we got a range of things from the salmon, the chicken club sandwich, the bacon onion marmalade burger and something else (Club sandwich I think)

Everyone enjoy their food however I was a little bit throne as the bacon onion marmalade was not what I expected. Granted, I could've just gotten bacon on the side for just a little more $ but decided to just stick with what they were doing and give it a try. The burger was cooked well however the bread that came with it was like a brioche type & seemed like it was at its last day & a bit stale. 

I asked for the marmalade on the side so I was able to finish the 2nd half of the burger with some delete.  I had a bit of the salmon and it was excellent. Along with dinner I had a few Moscow Mules that helped. Been twice and everything has been good but not a fan of the burger/marmalade combo. If your. It a marmalade fan, get it on the side to try. Will come back and try some other stuff as the service was prompt & drinks were on point!"}
{"text":"I liked the general vibe of the place =) The food was good, service was adequate, a bit noisy (but to be expected for a proper pub). It just didn't really knock my socks off, hence 4 (vs 5) stars."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had tickets to see the Symphony so we decided to stop by for dinner before since it was so close to the symphony hall downtown. We were greeted very friendly and seated exceptionally fast. We both ordered a Guinness and I suddenly felt like I had been transported to an English Pub! The burgers we ordered were fantastic, and the buns (not sure if they're made there or not) were amazing! The ambience and overall vibe of this place is groovy and fun, we will definitely be coming back and recommend it to anyone looking for a cool place to pop in for a brew or a tasty bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Service and Food were both great. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'll definitely hit this place up."}
{"text":"1st Street Burger was a good choice!

Good ambiance. Great Irish Bar feel and the bar was generally clean and not too packed for a Friday Happy Hour.

Quick service. We just sat ourselves down during happy hour and service was quick nonetheless!

They also have a great selection of drafts and cans. I got some scotch ale and was very satisfied with my overall meal and experience."}
{"text":"Cute pub with lots of choices in beers. I had the Kettle Black Burger and it was delicious. The meat was cooked perfect, the topping tasted great and the bun was so soft! My husband had the fish & chips. The fish is cut fresh there, the tater sauce was homemade and fantastic and the Cole slaw too was fresh and flavorful. The only disappointing part was both of our French fries were cold and soft from the moment they were served. Other than that the service was great and staff friendly."}
{"text":"This week the Jolly Diners headed to The Kettle Black Kitchen & Pub in downtown Phx. We started off with a Bavarian pretzel and mustard. It was very delicious. My mom  ordered the soup of the day which was a cream chicken with bread. My sister had fish and chips, and I had curry fries and the black bean burger. Everything was great. This is a pub atmosphere with pub food made better than traditional pub fare by a creative chef. The music was loud and from the late 1960's and 70's. Sports played on flat screen televisions. Behind the bar, the liquor cabinets had picture frames around them. We arrived about 4:30 pm and the place earnestly came to life within an hour; filled by tens of customers having a good time. It's a place you can take a first date, or your buddies from the office. The Jolly Diners rated the Kettle Black a 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place walking through downtown. Great friendly staff. Awesome decor. Very nice selection of beers and cocktails, and to top it off DELICIOUS FOOD!"}
{"text":"Ate on the patio with our dog while we were in town for the night . The staff was very nice and accommodating. They brought out some water for our furbaby and checked on us regularly. 

Dinner was great.  Everything came out as ordered and tasted delicious. We will stop by again if we're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! I eat out 275 nights a year and I am blown away how good the food is here. Don't let the \"pub\" atmosphere fool you. This is Gastro Amazing at its finest! Layer that with incredible service from a very attentive staff and you have a winner! Casual place great beer and amazing food, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. Actually walked well out of our way to check this place out. The interior is fun, but the ceasar salad was way too salty, the chicken appetizer  (kind of strips) was gross, and the curry sauce for the fries was rather bland."}
{"text":"Outstanding Philly cheese fries! Stopped here with my mother while in town for a trade show. We weren't looking for anything heavy, but we're tempted by the menu and ended up splitting the fries and a salad. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"The service was wonderful. Drinks were pricey but it was New Years so who knows what I ordered. He mac and cheese was super yummy!"}
{"text":"Great service, food, and atmosphere! I have been to Ireland many times and I lived in Phoenix for a few years and can totally say this is the closest it gets to an Irish pub in the valley. I would totally recommend it to anyone that wants to have a good meal and a great time! I hope they keep it up!!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and are NEVER disappointed. Amazing bartenders, great food, cool bar vibe. Our go to when in downtown PHX."}
{"text":"I tried this place based on reviews on Yelp. I wasn't very impressed with the interior. To the earlier persons review there wasn't anyone at the door to greet you. It wasn't crowded so that was cool. I ordered a Tito dirty martini and it came to me clean as a whistle. I promptly sent it back as I'm a dirty martini lover and it came back a little dirty. I was ok with that but I did ask for extra olives. Didn't get those either. Anyway my food was good but not great. I was looking for to die for fish and chips. Just didn't happen. Not sure I'm a repeat customer here. It's very convenient for travels staying at hotels nearby."}
{"text":"Omg service was amazing. Food was to die for and ambiance is so awesome.  Had their cheesesteak fries which were to die for. Bartender was on it and drinks good!!!  Can't wait to come back. Had the crab cakes - good. My husband loved the 1st street burger  but the cheesesteak fries .... seriously amazing.  Sit at the bar if u can, bartenders were super attentive"}
{"text":"Decided on this local PUB just around corner from my hotel. I had read good things about this place on Yelp and was expecting more than it delivered... I had the Ruben Sandwich with hand cut fries with a pint of Guinness. This was during Happy Hour on a Wednesday night and the place was roughly at about half capacity. First complaint: with several TV's showing multiple games simultaneously, NO sound from ANY of the games were on... Instead I had to listen to \"Born in the USA\" by Springsteen while LeBron was showing the way of the REAL King on the court... Confusing? The answer is absolutely YES! Second complaint: The hand cut fries was nothing special. Even Jack in the Box has better tasting \"hand cut fries\". Third complaint: A pint of Guinness is $6.00 - DURING HAPPY HOUR... Seriously? Now to the positive: the Ruben Sandwich was actually VERY GOOD! Creamy dressing, perfectly battered and toasted bread with succulent, tender corned beef and sauerkraut that would make a native German asking for more! Too bad the serving of corned beef was not big enough for my liking..."}
{"text":"A little disappointed with this one. We went here prior to going to try out the escape room. The yelp reviews were pretty high and I am assuming the people who suggested it were high as well. It would appear to be an Irish pub. They have Guinness and all of the decor is a pinterest version of what a man cave should look like with an Irish theme. The menu is limited as well as the beers they have on tap. I guess they assumed having Guinness and Fish and Chips plus some Irish swag makes it an Irish pub. I ordered a Buffalo Trace Manhattan and they brought me the drink without the cherry and it didn't quite taste like a Manhattan. I asked the waitress where the cherry was and she told me the bartender does not make a Manhattan the normal way. I asked her politely if I could have it the normal way. She told me to just try it. So I just drank it. I do have to say the buffalo chicken fries were pretty good. I ordered the southwest chicken wrap for dinner. It was pretty much solid lettuce in a tortilla and was lacking flavor. The lettuce had been washed apparently fairly recently which would explain why it was watery. Honestly this place has an energy in it, but it has more to do with people in the place than the place itself. This really is a really very poor impression of Seamus McCaffrey's. If you like Irish pub's maybe try one where they do it the normal way, seriously try Seamus McCaffrey's instead."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!! If you are in the Phoenix area run, don't walk, to The Kettle Black Kitchen!!!  From the moment we walked in the door the Irish-esque pub setting felt homey and inviting. 
I ordered the chicken kabobs and my DH ordered the sweet chili chicken wings. Neither disappointed but I have to RAVE about the kabobs. From the first bite I was hooked. Not only was the chicken moist but it was simply divine. Whatever they marinate their chicken in should be bottled and sold on supermarket shelves everywhere! Amazing doesn't cover it. And the roasted corn pico and sweet Chile sauce only added to the magic of the dish. Served on a bed of green beans (YUM!!) the kabobs were huge and tasty. For $13 I would eat these all day, everyday!! 
I also have to give kudos to their fresh cut french fries. We ordered the garlic fries and while they weren't very garlicky (we are from WA state where we are used to Safeco field garlic fries) the lack of garlic was doin forgotten simply due to the deliciousness of the fries!
Like I said- don't pass this place up if you're in the Phoenix area. It's more than worth doing to!!"}
{"text":"Service was great and good vibe. Food was fantastic. We had the flatiron, veggie burger and pork belly Mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Went in with really high hopes tonight. Bartender was incredibly nice. Guinness was really cold & good, and the Bavarian pretzel was awesome. Kitchen was moving SLOW.

The fish & chips were a disaster. Fish was overdone & so dry i could barely chew it. Fries were burned & under seasoned. Coleslaw was warm (because the plate had sat under the heat lamp for at least 10 minutes). I think it's time to change the oil in the fryer. 


I really wanted to like the food, but I just can't."}
{"text":"After two visits,  we've tried several items on the menu and all but one was great.(crab cakes were good, not great). Fish & chips great (one person had soggy fries, one has crispy), scallops were delectable,  burger solid, bread pudding scrumptious.  Server is a little hit and miss depending on how busy it is. Draft selection great. Only place on west coast to have Magners hard cider on draft!"}
{"text":"A great little detour on our road trip. 

We got in around 4pm which was the perfect timing for a Saturday night; they seemed to fill up very quickly after that. 

The food was very good. We started with the truffle fries (we weren't going to get them but then we saw someone walk by with them and we had to try them) and they were very good. Nice and crispy! We got the steak salad and the bacon onion burger, but very good as well. The salad was the perfect size if you were thinking about that bread pudding which we highly recommend. That bread pudding alone is reason enough to stop through. 

They did seem a little under staffed for a Saturday, but everyone was very friendly and helpful when they stopped by our booth!"}
{"text":"This was absolutely the most perfect introduction to the Phoenix area I could have asked for. The service was outstanding and the food was darn tasty. Plus, the place was cool and very nice inside, with great music playing, no less. I appreciated the local taps and thrice enjoyed a delicious raspberry ale from Huss Brewing Company. I don't know when I will find myself in Phoenix next, but I will enjoy again before I go and make it a must next time I visit. Crab cakes and steak salad were delicious - looking forward to trying some other tasty business! Awesome place, will return."}
{"text":"Ordered the Oban whiskey. It should have been served in a highball or whiskey glass but was instead served in a shot glass. And was thus served as a shot. With the kind of vibe this place is trying to give off... and with their vast whiskey options, I think they could do better"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were looking for a fun place to have dinner in downtown Phoenix. We were on our way to another place when we saw this one. We saw it was cute and seating was available. After ordering the truffle fries. Hummus plate and turkey burger we were filled with yummy food. To top the evening off we ordered the bread pudding (such amazing soul food)!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar at The Kettle Black Kitchen & Pub and met the friendliest bartender ever! He ended up shaking our hands at the end of our meal to thank us for coming in. We ordered the blackened chicken sandwich with a side salad and the southwest chicken wrap with fries - both were delicious. Also we ordered the bread pudding for dessert and wow - so good!! The prices are very reasonable - drafts beer were ~$6, each our sandwiches were $10 and the dessert was $8. What a solid experience - we would be regulars if we lived in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We should have taken it as a sign to leave when it took 15 minutes for a waitress to take our drink order in a 1/5 full restaurant. Service was horrible. Food was bland."}
{"text":"Just had their onion burger and I'm thoroughly impressed. There aren't many good burgers in the valley, but I'm glad to have been pleasantly surprised here. The service was excellent as our waitress, Danielle was spot on with her recommendations and was able to walk that fine line of being attentive, yet not annoying. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Great spot to day drink. 

Cool bar / restaurant with good food and a great Rueben. 

Cheese steak sandwich is legit. 

Full bar but only 3 TVs. 

I like this place a lot but if you're looking for authentic Irish pub keep looking."}
{"text":"Excellent Irish pub. Great food good selection of whisky and beers. I've been to Ireland twice this year and have to say was on par."}
{"text":"Chicken club delicious!! French fries not so much some were soft and some were hard as a rock which was pretty disappointing, service was great. Their internet and cable were down so we couldn't watch the Sunday night game. It did come back late 4th quarter. And their bread pudding was average not the best but not the worst either."}
{"text":"Food was great. Drinks were great. Atmosphere was great. It was a busy night at the restaurant and we still got seated and served in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Not big on 5 star ratings but this is deserved. We started with the philly cheese steak fries which are about the best you could ever expect. The guys all got burgers which they said are in the top three burgers they've ever had. I went with the steak which is absolutely fantastic. Wait staff is awesome. If you're in Phoenix you HAVE to come here."}
{"text":"Great old time pub with superb food."}
{"text":"This is a very mediocre place for lunch. They were out of pork belly sliders, the ahi tuna salad, and OUT OF GUINNESS?

I had the reuben sandwich and it was small and the bread was toasted with way too much butter. Nothing about this place makes it special.

A very underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp family for leading me into this great restaurant for lunch. I came here and sat belly up at the bar. I've read great things about the fish and chips dish so decided to immediately order that. Wow! Everything was tasty and more! The fish was cooked perfectly and battered to perfection. The fries where fresh cut and crispy! Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of the coleslaw but will definitely be coming back to try different dishes!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best food, best service, and amazing atmosphere! Great selection of craft beer as well! Every time I am downtown I make it a point to come here! Also truffle fries are to die for!"}
{"text":"Besides the waiter not getting my drink made properly and then correcting me on the correct name of a drink (training wheels-lemon wedge with salt) when I ordered a chilled shot with lemon squeezed inside not a wedge and then rimmed with salt....to requesting my check with only the alcohol because the party I was with wanted to take care of the entire bill. I asked discreetly so the other party would get the bill for just the food but he only brought the bill with the alcohol to me in front of the other party. Besides that service the food was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"So i came here with my buddy and his now wife hanging out after i flew into NYC.  We arrived kinda late, around 10 pm or so, the place wasn't really busy.  We all ordered the burgers, and a beer each and hung out.  The vibe of the place was pretty chill and very relaxed.  The food was pretty good, i had no complaints and the size of the burgers were good.  I was satisfied with everything."}
{"text":"Can't wait to come back here and try more stuff off the menu, we arrived past 11:30 at night and had to Oder apps since the grill was shut down but man the apps did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers, whiskey, cocktails, wine and food. Love the atmosphere and the service is top notch. The music was on point too. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great pub in downtown Phoenix. Food and wine were great. The pretzel appetizer was awesome. Wish I worked closer so I could come more often."}
{"text":"The best pub in Phoenix hands down. The interior is amazing. Feels like you've been transported to Ireland or England to a proper pub. The red doors and windows on the exterior are beautiful. The food is fantastic! Everything is fresh and you can taste it. This will be my new favorite spot in town."}
{"text":"Great spot for downtown lunch. Love the ambiance it transcends you to a different place. Everything I have had for lunch has been good. My favorite menu item is the Bread Pudding..Yum, Yum!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a drink...we decided to get cocktails, which was probably a mistake. We asked which cocktails would be in the sweeter side and the bartender recommended a couple cocktails, the John Denver and dear prudence. Well....these cocktails were pretty bad... Very strong and not very tasty. Additionally, they were on the pricy side for a cocktail that wasn't terribly delicious. This place did redeem itself in beer. They had a decent beer selection and we did a pretty killer car bomb. The car bomb cost less than the less tasty cocktails. My advice, come for the atmosphere and the beer...skip the cocktails."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed this. Food was incredible and well prepared. The dishes are great portion sizes. I had the 1st burger and philly fries. I don't think it would have been possible for me to eat all of them by myself. 

The atmosphere was clean enjoyable. Football was on the TV's and the beer selection was perfect. 

I don't think I could have enjoyed a better night out and wish I had time to go back again during my stay downtown."}
{"text":"We love Finnegan's and we love Tom and Jimmy's new place as well. The decor and atmosphere are very cool. The food is delicious. We had the mussels and a burger. Staff was attentive and it was awesome for Tom to stop by and chat. These guys are accessible and down to earth. Cool that is next to La Piazza as well. West side influence downtown!"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch many times since I work just across the street, but today after work the girls and I came for happy hour. I have to say, Mikeal was our server and he was AMAZING!! Super friendly and an all around great person! I've never had a had experience, everything and everyone has always been great. Tonight Mikeal made it even even better!!"}
{"text":"It's a bit of a hole in the wall, but the atmosphere is chill and the food is good. The owner has a great back story to the pub so be sure to hit him up if you're there. 

Good prices for good food, friendly staff, and a decent selection of beer. Great to hang out with coworkers or for some relaxing happy hour time with friends.

I had the crab cakes and SO had the chicken sandwich which we were both satisfied with. Worth a visit, and maybe a repeat."}
{"text":"We were Abe to locate the place very way. Parking very easy. It looked a bit non description from the street....but wait there's more.  The sat us table for two and immediately we received water not Phoenix water filtered thanks for that. 30 seconds in Michael gave us some beer advise Pumkin Ale and North Mountain Scotch Ale. Let's get a pretzel I think and the answer is yes get it great buttery flavor tummy cheese sauce made here fresh and ground mustard. It was gone quick paired with our beers. Ok onward another round a beers and two burgers. We had the classic and the bacon onion burger we had the fries get those not the salad or coleslaw your eating a burger for Christ sake eat fries. Those came paired so well with beer that it disappeared post haste awesome good burger be fries. So norm we don't do dessert but so far the food is rockin beers are stellar..... So he'll ya lets do dessert.  There is only one bread pudding.  It ain't ur mammy's bread pudding. A decadent dessert paired with a deliciousness sauce and some Irish coffee umm ya do it!!!!! We loved this little joint."}
{"text":"I loved this gastropub downtown!! It has a stylish yet comfy atmosphere, the bartenders are friendly & knowledgeable, and there is a winning selection of bourbon (& other whiskies)! Check it out and tell Adam the bartender that I sent you!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great atmosphere! We stopped in for dinner and a few beers and were not let down by the great reviews here on Yelp. 

I had the 1st Street Burger, recommended by the waitress and it was phenomenal! I would have never in a million years put together that combination of toppings, but it was divine - the chef is some kind of burger wizard. The hand cut fries were delicious and the portion size was perfect. My husband had the fish and chips and loved it.

You owe it to yourself to come give them a try - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place

loved the decor and picture frames for the bar, very unique. the atmosphere is a little dim but perfect for the mood they are going for. very relaxing & welcoming spot.

they have a normal draft beer selection, not to crafty but it has a couple odd balls that were good. i tried the cucumber gose by black market, it didn't disappoint. my friend ordered a single whisky, it was nice and fatty.

the burgers, both turkey and ground beef were delicious. the fires were a bit sogged down, but at least they were super fresh.

all in all this is a great place for food and drinks, i will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The food was great and at the beginning the seemed nice. Unfortunately, their misleading remarks on food portions left me hungry and the way they treated my gf pissed me off. They doubted her because she was a girl and that mysonginistic attitude was a turn off. After they said I couldn't finish my food, it was super good, I killed it and they stopped talking to us which made it seem like they were fake. If they weren't mean or anything towards us they would have a 7/5"}
{"text":"Good lunch spot - fast service and a great steak salad. It's quiet and good for groups too."}
{"text":"Great food great service  the scallops Were VERY GOOD.  I ate there twice while I was in town and would go back again when I return to town"}
{"text":"Great place right outside cityscape... Beers are cold and the food is delicious. The owners are involved and attentive and took great care of all the patrons on the patio when a server was not available. The only downside was the giant Manchester City supporters banner... The establishment was too classy for such filth. Come on you Gunners!"}
{"text":"My bartender gave me amazing service and my drinks came out quick. He was very good looking. Recommending this place to all my people"}
{"text":"Excellent service, beer was ice cold and great food!  I ordered a local IPA and fish and chips.  The fish was perfect and the IPA was Delish.  I would go back again!"}
{"text":"They make a pork belly mac and cheese that is fabulous.  Would come back again for more."}
{"text":"Stopped in before a show at Coamerica and stopped in based on the Yelp reviews. Great place and will now go back for more.

Atmosphere - Great interior, it's a pub. As opposed to other pubs this one is clean. Music is good and at a good level. We sat at the bar and appreciate the plugs to charge our phones.

Service - It was great. The bartenders were hustling because they were busy but always took time to check on us. I appreciated the feedback from our bartender when I asked for suggestions on the menu.

Food - Also great. Crab cakes app was very good. You don't think of crab cakes in Phoenix but they pulled off. Good size, taste and the wasabi mayo worked with it. Ordered the fish & chips on our bartenders recommendation and he didn't steer us wrong. The highlight was the batter on the fish. A big portion that comes with fries that are not traditional pub fries but are hand cut and really, really good. The braised short ribs had good flavor and a good size serving. You don't see brussel sprouts too often in a pub and they were great.

Great place, will make a destination for fish & chips, and of course the Guinness. A lot more on the menu to try and I expect it to be good also."}
{"text":"Got waters before we even finished sitting and our waiter Mikeal was fantastic! Ordered the corn beef and cabbage which was amazing and the philly cheese steak fries were superb! Definitely coming back and recommend this place to all who like a pub like atmosphere with a twist of class."}
{"text":"Loved this place ! My wife and I were in Phoenix for a Diamond backs game and stopped here. It has the feel of an Irish pub but the food was better than your average bar food. I got the pork mac and cheese and it was great. Great location too as it is a 5 minute walk to the baseball/basketball stadium. If you are in Phoenix definitely stop by !"}
{"text":"Overall: 7/10 round down to 3/5 stars

Food: 7/10 Good but not memorable 

Location: 8/10 

Price: 7/10

Service: 8/10 

Came here a while ago on a business trip.  Close to convention center.  Food is average and good bar food, but nothing to rave and rant about.  If you're in town for a conference, good for a bite and drinks, but definitely not a must see.  

Verdict: I'd come back if I was on business, but I probably wouldn't come back if I were a local"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch during their soft opening with my wife. We really enjoyed everything! Service was prompt and friendly, and the decor is beautiful. I really hope this succeeds which I think it will. The food was limited during the soft opening but it was still tasty. We live nearby so we will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Decent, but didn't blow us away. We are in on business and saw all the 5-star reviews, so we thought we'd give it a try. 

We had wings for a starter. I think they were double fried to get them crispy, but one of my drumettes had what appeared to be and tasted like parchment paper stuck to it. 

I had the flat iron peppercorn steak, which was perfectly cooked but the green beans were nearly raw. I like them crisp, but these were more like blanched than cooked. 

My co-worker had a Ruben and didn't eat it all - said it was \"okay\". 

Don't think we'll be back next time."}
{"text":"Nice new looking restaurant in downtown Phoenix. We arrived while they were still serving the lunch menu. The much menu did not interests us but we had a chance to look at the dinner menu that looks very good. I will go back for dinner and edit my review."}
{"text":"This bar is a bartenders dream establishment. The way behind the bar is constructed is fantastic! Anyway, the bar itself is beautiful. Hip speak easy feel but laid back, not uptight. Plenty of seating! Great eclectic menu with lots to pick from. Happy hour menu has plenty to chose from as well! Food was delicious.  Not standard bar food either. And they serve my favorite cidre in a can! What's not to love?"}
{"text":"We love Kettle Black!!! We came in for some drinks and ended up ordering the pretzel appetizer. The cheese dip was amazing. Most importantly, the waitress was awesome and the service was great! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"it's a small place and always seem to be hopping - so get there early and try to save seats for friends!  But the food and drink are well worth it - so go!  the spicy choices are spicy, so be warned.  but everything we tried was flavorful, fresh, hot, and tasty tasty tasty!  Definitely try every one of their happy hour specials - both of the topped French fry bowls were incredible - it's been about a month since this trip and my friends and I are still talking about them!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, nice beer selection and pleasant service! Philly Cheese Fries are worth the trip alone!"}
{"text":"My first visit was after midnight and the kitchen was closed.  One of the customers was speaking highly of the food so I had to come back to try it.  I met one of the chefs and one of the co-owners.  They have an good selection for Irish, Scotch, and Bourbon and draft beers.

I ordered the 1st Street burger and the crab cakes.  Both were amazing.  Well worth the trip back."}
{"text":"Food was great, drinks were great! We needed up going here by accident but boy we're we satisfied. The atmosphere is very welcoming, the employees were very kind and nicely honest. I would definitely recommend this spot for and occasion."}
{"text":"Working across the street from Kettle Black has made my job very exciting. Exciting, first, to watch the exterior of this pub come together. Exciting, second, for offering another lunch alternative. Exciting. third, for being a spot I'll be taking people when showing off DTPHX.

So, I've been here a few times, traveled around the menu and must say I've had several good meals. While partial to the fish and chips, the burgers have been solid. And I simple LOVE the soft pretzel. Like, engagement ceremony love it.

While I've never had a drink here (I quit drinking last year), their selection of whiskeys looks impressive. But their water has always been satisfying."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. The bartenders are very friendly and service is always prompt. It has the vibe of a friendly neighborhood bar and is hands down my favorite downtown!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and overall vibe!  I'll be back!  The Rueben is excellent!  And they make a solid Old fashioned!  Oddly enough, the chicken kabobs were spectacular!  First street burger was dynamite. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here and liked it so much I came back for dinner! For lunch I had the Philly Cheesesteak Fries, which were terrific. Also the steak salad and it was very good as well. The jalapeno dressing for the salad was very good and not spicy at all. For dinner I had the Turkey burger and it was very good. Not dry or tasteless like a lot of turkey burgers. Also had the garlic fries which were good, but not as good as the Cheesesteak Fries. A person I was with had the chicken kabobs and they looked very good. Good selection of beers here and the decor is simple and cozy. Friendly wait staff too. Check this spot out if you're downtown."}
{"text":"Food was good,  gnats flying around and dead all over booth connection to wall and the fact they went 1 for 3 of the beers I wanted to try earned them a penalty of -3 stars. 

Need to be better managed better."}
